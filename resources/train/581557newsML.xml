<p>The head of Long Island Lighting Co on Wednesday warned state lawmakers that the opportunity to conclude a partial state takeover of the firm, which is merging with Brooklyn Union Gas, was fleeting.</p>
<p>W.J. Catacosinos, chairman and chief executive officer of LILCO, in prepared remarks, said: &quot;As you examine this proposal, please keep in mind that the benefits of this plan result largely from LIPA's tax-exempt status, and that there is a window of opportunity to take advantage of LIPA's tax exemption, and that window is rapidly closing.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA).  </p>
<p>The head of LILCO made his comments to the Democrat-led state Assembly. Its Speaker, Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, has raised a number of questions about the deal, which would be funded by an approximately $7.3 billion sale of tax-exempt bonds--the nation's largest such offering.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the company explained that LILCO feared the Internal Revenue Service might approve a new rule that would impose a big capital gains tax, which could derail the deal. &quot;Basically, the concern is that the I.R.S. is going to pass a new regulation and that new regulation would require the transaction to have a $2 billion capital gains tax.&quot;</p>
<p>When LIPA and the companies announced the deal in mid-March, Frank Zarb, the LIPA chairman who since then has stepped down, explained that a waiver on federal capital gains taxes would be a key to the success of the agency's plans to buy utility assets from Brooklyn Union Gas and LILCO. He added LIPA faced a June deadline for submitting all its paperwork to the I.R.S.</p>
