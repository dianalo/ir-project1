<p>A leading member of Vietnam's Politburo said on Thursday investors had nothing to fear from a government drive to establish Communist Party cells in all walks of life, including foreign joint-venture companies.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to worry about because party cells and trade unions are only there to help enterprises do better and bring benefits to the workers, the business and our country,&quot; Lieutenant-General Le Kha Phieu told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Phieu, the country's Military Political Commissar, is ranked fifth on the elite Politburo and is tipped by some observers as a potential successor to General Le Duc Anh as president.</p>
<p>Speaking after a walkabout at a foreign investment fair in Hanoi, Phieu said he welcomed the investment which has flooded in from abroad since the country opened its doors to the outside world and embarked on reforms along market lines.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors have made big efforts in investing in Vietnam,&quot; Phieu said.</p>
<p>&quot;...I would like to say that there is no need for foreign investors to be worried when they come and invest in Vietnam. Foreign investors come to set up joint ventures or do business with Vietnam -- that is the mutual benefit for both sides.&quot;</p>
<p>The government says it has now approved foreign-invested projects worth some $24.5 billion.</p>
<p>However, less than a third of that sum has been implemented, partly due to endless red tape. Investors have also expressed concern about strict control on business operations.</p>
<p>The government has made efforts to strengthen the party, a key tenet of a five-year plan which was unveiled at a landmark congress earlier this year.</p>
<p>The plan includes directives for recruiting members and establishing groups and cells within private companies and calls for regulations governing their operation.</p>
<p>Party cells are local political units which operate nationwide in businesses, communes, schools and a host of other institutions to ensure compliance with government and party policy.</p>
