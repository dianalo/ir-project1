<p>Armenian riot police mounted a heavy guard around President Levon Ter-Petrosyan's residence on Thursday after violent clashes which the interior minister described as an attempted coup.</p>
<p>Police fired over the heads of a crowd which stormed the parliament grounds in the capital Yerevan on Wednesday during protests over Ter-Petrosyan's victory in Sunday's presidential election in the mountainous Caucasus state.</p>
<p>The protesters, who say the vote was rigged to defeat former prime minister Vazgen Manukyan, hurled bricks and the police waded in with truncheons.</p>
<p>At least seven protesters were hurt in the clashes, but Interior Minister Vanik Siradegyan said no one was killed.</p>
<p>&quot;After failing to achieve victory with democratic methods, they turned to violence. Four to five thousand people broke down the gates of the parliament and went in,&quot; Siradegyan said in a short television address to the nation of about 3.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;All of this must be characterised as an attempt at a state coup, the responsibility for which lies completely with the organisers,&quot; he said, blaming the violence on leaders of Manukyan's party, the National Democratic Union (NDU).</p>
<p>Riot police later took up position guarding the stately, two-storey presidential palace, the official residence where a spokesman had earlier said Ter-Petrosyan was staying.</p>
<p>Yerevan was by then quiet, but bricks lay scattered across the streets and broken glass panes at bus stops bore witness to the clashes.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan, 51, has guided Armenia through five years of hardship since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>Conditions have eased in recent months but Armenia, which is sandwiched between Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, has suffered many winters of power cuts and shortages.</p>
<p>Manukyan, 50, promised in his election campaign to raise standards quickly in the impoverished country.</p>
<p>The election commission said on Wednesday preliminary final results showed Ter-Petrosyan with 52.09 percent of votes cast to 41.07 percent for Manukyan.</p>
<p>But the NDU says it has evidence of fraud and that Manukyan won the election by 55 to 37 percent. Some election observers have also reported irregularities although the authorities have denied rigging the vote.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has been coordinating international observers, has issued a carefully-worded preliminary report criticising &quot;very serious&quot; irregularities in voting procedures.</p>
<p>It did not question the overall legitimacy of the elections but said its findings did not deal with the counting procedure.</p>
