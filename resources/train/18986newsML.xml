<p>South African buyers, fearing a domestic shortage of maize due to higher exports, will import at least 70,000 tonnes of yellow maize this season, industry officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Western Cape Maize Buyers Association told Reuters the body would open tenders for maize imports on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have a fairly big crop but it seems to me that the committed exports will be higher than the surplus and that might create a shortage in the country which is obviously stupid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To keep our mills running in the Western Cape and because it is on the coast, the import of maize will be the cheapest there, so we have to look at securing our position.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman said the buyers group was looking for 35,000 tonnes for December and 35,000 tonnes for January.</p>
<p>Depending on prices, there could also be be further imports up to the start of the new season in mid-1997, he added.</p>
<p>The latest estimates of the National Crop Estimates Committee puts the 1996/1997 maize crop at 9.484 million tonnes from 4.406 million tonnes in the previous season.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom raised the export limit to 3.3 million tonnes from 2.55 million at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>The 1996/97 marketing year has seen private maize exports allowed for the first time after the maize industry was deregulated.</p>
<p>The 3.3 million tonnes consists of 1.8 million tonnes for private exports and 1.5 million tonnes in the state-owned Maize Board's export pools.</p>
<p>Maize traders said they foresaw problems for farmers if exports did not lead to a deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;Each shipload that comes in will cause a problem. If there is no shortage brought on by exports, there will be a surplus which will affect the farmer's purse directly,&quot; said one maize trader.</p>
<p>The Western Cape Maize Buyers' Association said it was aware of the possible impact on producers. &quot;But we can't gamble,&quot; the association spokesman said.</p>
