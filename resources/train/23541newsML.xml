<p>Former Italian international winger Gianluigi Lentini, transferred to Milan in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum, has been loaned to serie A club Atalanta for a year, newspapers reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The Gazzetta dello Sport said the deal would cost Atalanta around $600,000.</p>
<p>Lentini, 27, joined Milan from Torino in a $12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities.</p>
<p>The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in Turin.</p>
<p>The move to Bergamo-based Atalanta reunites Lentini, who fell out with ex-Milan coach Fabio Capello last season, with his former coach at Torino, Emiliano Mondonico.</p>
