<headline>CIBC Q3 higher on loans, trading revenues.</headline>

<p>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said on Thursday that growth in consumer lending, brokerage commissions, underwriting fees and trading revenues delivered a 24 percent gain in third-quarter net income.</p>
<p>CIBC's net income rose to C$336 million in the three months ended July 31, up from C$270 million in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Earnings per share climbed to C$1.50 from C$1.13 in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>The results beat the average C$1.43 per share estimated by industry analysts.  </p>
<p>Return on equity was 16.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with 13.7 percent for the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our solid performance this quarter reflects the continued strong contribution from our core businesses,&quot; CIBC chairman Al Flood said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said CIBC's personal and commercial bank continued its strong performance in the third quarter, while strategic decisions in recent years by CIBC's brokerage unit, CIBC Wood Gundy had begun to pay off.</p>
<p>Flood said new business lines such as financial products and high-yield debt were now contributing to the bottom line.  </p>
<p>CIBC said strong financial markets boosted underwriting and commissions on securities transactions by 27 percent.</p>
<p>Revenue from foreign exchange and capital market businesses rose 32 percent to C$107 million.</p>
<p>CIBC's electronic services posted an average 17 percent increase in business volumes from the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>For example, debit card transactions almost doubled to 22.3 million in the quarter.</p>
<p>Automated banking machine (ABM) use grew by 1.0 million transactions to 61.1 million. Telephone banking transactions more than doubled to 1.6 million.  </p>
<p>Net interest income was C$1.1 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.04 billion in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Non-interest income rose to C$691 million in the third quarter from C$592 million last year. &quot;This increase resulted primarily from growth in underwriting fees and foreign exchange and capital markets,&quot; CIBC said.</p>
<p>CIBC's loan loss provision of $120 million for the quarter put the bank on track to meet its annual provision of C$480 million.</p>
