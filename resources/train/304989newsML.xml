<p>Like its more famous competitor further south in Florida, Team Rental Group Inc is buying a leading U.S. car-rental agency to stock a growing chain of second-hand car outlets.</p>
<p>But unlike Republic Industries, the services group controlled by billionaire Wayne Huizenga which last week agreed to buy National Car Rental for $600 million, Team Rental has deep roots in the U.S. car-rental business.  </p>
<p>The largest Budget franchisee, Team Rental agreed earlier to acquire all of Budget Rental from Ford Motor Co in a cash and equities deal valued by the companies at around $350 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We're kind of a bread and butter company,&quot; Team Rental chief executive Sandy Miller told a newspaper last year. &quot;No Mercedes. No Lexus. No BMW.&quot;</p>
<p>Miller was unavailable on Tuesday for comment, a spokesman said.  </p>
<p>Team Rental has relied heavily on the lucrative central Florida car-rental market, serving tourists, to purchase other Budget franchise operators in Los Angeles and Phoenix.  It already owns and operates 13 Budget franchises at 155 locations in 13 states.</p>
<p>Along with each franchise in such states as New York and Indiana, Team Rental also operates sales outlets for its used cars. That business had largely dried up in the 1980s when car manufacturers retained ownership and sold those cars at auction. But the automakers have reversed course.  </p>
<p>Team's Budget sales outlets court middle-market buyers such as families with incomes to $35,000 to $65,000.  Team Rental's average price is $14,000 for a current-year or year-old model still under factory warranty.</p>
<p>Many of the cars are Fords, a practice which is unlikely to change since Tuesday's transaction includes a fresh supply agreement with Ford for cars and trucks.</p>
<p>&quot;Budget's customers have been renting Ford and Lincoln Mercury products for 25 years.  This new supply agreement will allow us to continue and even enhance our relationship for many years to come,&quot; Miller said in a news release.</p>
<p>Republic, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and scheduled this week to formally approve a merger with AutoNation, has bought two big U.S. car rental agencies since November.</p>
<p>Both National and Alamo will be suppliers of used cars to AutoNation USA, a growing superstore chain seeking to consolidate the highly fragmented U.S. retail system for selling second-hand cars.</p>
<p>Team Rental shares, which have risen sharply since the company made a secondary offering last summer at 13, were off 1/4 to 23-1/4.</p>
