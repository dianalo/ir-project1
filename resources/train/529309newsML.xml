<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle early Tuesday were bid $68.00 per cwt and passed by owners pricing cattle at $69.00 to $70.00, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 4,000 head sold late Monday at $68.00 in the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma area, steady with light sales late last week but down $1 from earlier-week trade, sources said.</p>
<p>The light sales fueled sentiment that packers could be aggressive buyers of cattle again this week to ensure adequate live inventory to fill beef orders.</p>
<p>No Kansas sales were reported late Monday and light bids Tuesday at $68.00 were firmly rebuffed, sources there said.  </p>
<p>Several feedlot sources in the Panhandle said the market seemed poised to trade again at $68.00, which would be $1.00 lower than the bulk of last week's sales.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got a few pens that might go this morning at $68.00,&quot; a Panhandle-area feedyard manager said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices were seen weaker than most of last week's trade amid a soft tone to beef prices. Beef values rallied most of last week, but drifted lower on Friday and continued slightly lower on Monday.</p>
<p>Beef prices on Monday were quoted down $0.05 to $0.20 per cwt on 179 fabricated beef loads sold, USDA reported.</p>
