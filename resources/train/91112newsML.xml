<headline>EMERGENCY SUMMIT ON PEACE PROCESS IN CRISIS.</headline>

<p>Israelis and Palestinians said on Wednesday an emergency summit in Washington to save the collapsing Middle East peace process was in crisis.</p>
<p>Israeli troops, enforcing sweeping restrictions on movement in the occupied areas, killed one Palestinian and wounded five. Israel security sources and Palestinians said. It raised the death toll to 58 Palestinians and 15 Israelis since the violence began last week.</p>
<p>Representatives of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traded charges that the other was making unacceptable demands while conceding nothing.</p>
<p>As their talks continued at the summit, called urgently by U.S. President Bill Clinton, both sides were reported strengthening military positions in case of failure and a return to fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a crisis in Washington because of Israeli demands that have been rejected by the Palestinians,&quot; a well-informed Palestine Liberation Organisation official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official said Netanyahu had demanded the Palestinian Authority try police who had fired on Israeli soldiers last week and that Arafat cut the size of his police force. He said Palestinians rejected the demands.</p>
<p>He said Netanyahu in turn rejected Palestinian demands he set a date for Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron that the previous Israeli government had agreed. He also would not set a date for resuming talks on the final stage of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, even before the talks, had refused Palestinian and international requests to close a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem that had sparked the fighting on September 24.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans have asked the Israelis to close the tunnel. Netanyahu refused. The Palestinian side is studying issuing a statement to announce the failure of the summit but the Americans are intervening to stop them,&quot; the PLO official said.</p>
<p>Israeli radio and television stations talked of a crisis in the Washington talks. An Israeli official in Washington said Netanyahu had refused an immediate redeployment of troops in Hebron.</p>
<p>Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Arafat, accused Netanyahu of trying to rewrite the 1993 Oslo accords on Palestinian self-rule signed by the previous centre-left Labour government.</p>
<p>Palestinian youths threw stones at Israeli soldiers in occupied Hebron when a curfew was briefly lifted but rallies in other areas of the Israeli-blockaded West Bank and Gaza Strip were generally peaceful.</p>
<p>Palestinian traffic came to a halt for five minutes at noon in a strike against Israel's closure of Palestinian-ruled areas. The standstill was reminiscent of the shutdown Israel observes for victims of its wars and the Nazi Holocaust.</p>
<p>Thousands of Israelis and foreign Jews marched to the Wailing Wall for the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, an annual religious pilgrimage which took on political overtones.</p>
<p>A steady stream went through the narrow entrance to the controversial archaeological tunnel beside the wall. Netanyahu's decision to open another entrance from Arab Jerusalem's Moslem Quarter ignited already smouldering Arab anger.</p>
<p>At a rally some Israelis held banners reading: &quot;Hebron is ours forever&quot;. Hebron, a city holy to Moslems and Jews, is home to 100,000 Arabs and fewer than 400 militant Jews.</p>
<p>Palestinian-ruled cities were not under curfew but travel between them was virtually impossible because of an Israeli blockade. Israel has ringed them with tanks to quell violence if the summit collapses.</p>
<p>Syria said in the United Nations on Wednesday Israel had chosen confrontation and warned it would pay a heavy price.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told Israel Television the Arabs had given Netanyahu time to formulate policy and he had abused it.</p>
<p>&quot;When Mr Netanyahu was in Cairo and asked for time...that was okay with us and the other Arabs. But the fact was that he used that time to change the realities on the ground.&quot;</p>
