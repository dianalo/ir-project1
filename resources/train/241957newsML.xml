<p>Oil producing and consuming countries meeting on Saturday weighed ways to meet the world's growing energy needs at prices emerging economies, like host India, can afford.</p>
<p>Oil importers in the developing world are sweating under the strain put on their trade and budget deficits as oil prices near six-year highs. But the world's major oil producers say prices in real terms, that is stripping out inflation, have stayed low for too long and they need money to ensure the world has enough oil for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;If the prices are not right the investment will not flow,&quot; said Rilwanu Lukman, secretary-general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately you will end up with very low supplies and high demand and therefore prices will shoot up (to) $30 to $40 a barrel and that will be even worse for countries like India.&quot;</p>
<p>The dozens of countries attending the International Energy Conference, held in the India's tourist resort state of Goa, discussed how to invest hundreds of billions of dollars needed by the energy sector to keep pace with the expanding global economy.</p>
<p>Previous producer-consumer meetings, established after the Gulf War oil price scare in 1991, have done little to narrow the philosophical rift between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>But each conference has paid lip service to the need for cooperation and agreed price and supply stablity are a must.</p>
<p>This year both Norway and Venezuela have proposed that the conference set up a world body to help formulate global energy policy covering a range of issues for consumption requirements, investment, laws, taxes and environmental issues.</p>
<p>&quot;This conference is not for taking decisions and coming to conclusions. A lot of ideas will be explored and this (a world energy grouping) will be evolved in an appropriate forum,&quot; said Vijay Kelkar, secretary of India's petroleum ministry.</p>
<p>The spotlight at the conference has fallen firmly on the huge market potential of developing countries, particularly in Asia.</p>
<p>The region will overtake the United States as the world's biggest oil user in a few years and have growing economic clout.</p>
<p>&quot;The high rates of economic growth of these economies has put them at the centre stage in world economic relations and the world energy map into the next century,&quot; Saudi Arabia's Deputy Minister of Petroleum Affairs Abdulaziz Bin Salman Al Saud told an opening session of the two-day conference.</p>
<p>The developing countries share of world gross domestic product is expected to rise to 48 percent by 2010 from 35 percent today, he said. And their share of world energy demand is likely to rise to 40 percent by 2010 from 28 percent now.</p>
<p>Global oil consumption is expected to grow by 20 million barrels per day by 2010 from this year's 72 million bpd, and developing countries will account for 14 million bpd of the increase, the Saudi deputy minister said.</p>
<p>Leading members of OPEC assured the world's oil users that supplies were plentiful but stressed investment needed to be channeled to the right areas to ensure cheap supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an imbalance (of investment in OPEC and non-OPEC countries) which needs to be addressed, that if not taken care of over a period of time could lead to disruption,&quot; Lukman said.</p>
<p>He said some studies have shown that 80 percent of the money being invested in oil is going into non-OPEC countries even though they only hold 25 percent of the world's known oil reserves.</p>
<p>OPEC attracts far less investment even though it controls 75 percent of the world's oil and can pump it far more cheaply.</p>
<p>&quot;So the world is being made to pay higher costs uneccessarily when they could get cheaper resources, Lukman said.</p>
<p>All speakers at the morning session agreed there was a need to protect the environment. However, OPEC heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iran called on industrialised nations to avoid introducing environmental taxes on oil that would have repercussions on investment and prices that would hurt the developing world.</p>
