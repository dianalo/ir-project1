<title>UK: Euro HS fuel strong as Russian barrels go west.</title>
<headline>Euro HS fuel strong as Russian barrels go west.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>High sulphur fuel prices in the main Rotterdam-Antwerp  trading area firmed a little on Friday but business was very slow,  traders said.</p>
<p>With Europe entering its traditional summer holiday month the market  lacked energy.</p>
<p>Bunker demand was thin and barge trade was seen in the $92.50 to $93.50  a tonne range.</p>
<p>A tight high sulphur supply situation, with Russian cracked cargoes  getting quickly absorbed and little alternative production, continues  to boost the 3.5 percent market to unseasonably high levels.</p>
<p>Traders were seen fixing vessels to take Russian cracked and straight-run  fuel trans-atlantic, following an arb route that has sucked stock  away from Europe, where the consequent shortages have pushed bunker  prices upwards.</p>
<p>One percent cargoes stumble along out of fashion, with demand weak  and some reported selling of the product into the European bunker  market.</p>
<p>With the one percent arb to the U.S. shut there was little to lend  support and although cargoes were on offer for $93 and $94 a tonne  fob buyers were scarce.</p>
<p>August swaps were at $93/$94 with the market firmly in contango further  out.</p>
<p>A little industrial demand from Belgium has supported one percent  barges, which were pegged at $95/$97 by sellers. But again that market  was slow.</p>
