<p>Moslem rebels have massacred more than 80 villagers in Algeria, slaughtering some with chainsaws and dousing others in burning petrol during the Algerian Moslem weekend of Thursday and Friday, newspapers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The guerrillas, in the worst attack in the five years of Algeria's violence, exterminated 52 inhabitants of Thalit village in Medea province, 70 km (45 miles) southwest of Algiers, said El Watan newspaper.</p>
<p>About 40 rebels armed with axes, daggers and swords ringed the hamlet and moved in to kill everyone there, the paper added.</p>
<p>Liberte newspaper said 52 people in the community had their throats slit, with only one person escaping.</p>
<p>In another raid, more than 40 gunmen armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and shotguns and led by Algeria's ruthless Armed Islamic Group (GIA) chief Antar Zouabri hacked to death 15 villagers in Amroussa community in Blida province, 50 km (30 miles) south of Algiers, said Liberte.</p>
<p>&quot;The assailants broke into seven houses and cut up 15 people, including seven women and three children, with a chainsaw,&quot; added Liberte quoting survivors from Amroussa.</p>
<p>It said that some people who tried to flee were doused with petrol and set ablaze.</p>
<p>&quot;My neighbour hid under a car but was spotted. They set fire to the vehicle and he couldn't get out. He died there,&quot; the paper quoted a survivor as saying.</p>
<p>Another survivor said: &quot;They killed my nephew in front his mother, then one of them fired several times at my sister. Before they left, they set fire to the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Liberte said some survivors on Saturday loaded their belongings into vans and left the village.</p>
<p>In another killing, the newspaper said five civilians had their throats cut, and seven were abducted in Sidi Naamane in Tizi-Ouzou province, 90 km (60 miles) east of Algiers.</p>
<p>Moslem guerrillas cut the throats of four family members near the coastal town of Moretti, 40 km (25 miles) west of Algiers, said El Watan.</p>
<p>Near Beni Slimane town, 90 km (60 miles) southeast of Algiers, rebels erected a roadblock and killed an unspecified number of passengers of vehicles, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;They intercepted cars, picked up passengers and shot them dead at point blank range,&quot; said El Watan.</p>
<p>El Watan, calling the Algerian Moslem weekend a &quot;bloody weekend&quot;, said more than 80 people have been killed in the massacres and attacks on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The weekend was one of the most deadly during the five years of Algeria's violence locking Moslem guerrillas against government forces.</p>
<p>The killings came after the Algerian army reportedly killed more than 100 Moslem guerrillas the previous Saturday and Sunday near Tizi-Ouzou.</p>
<p>The army and security forces are out in force carrying out search operations against Moslem guerrillas across the country ahead of Algeria's June 5 general elections.</p>
<p>Radical Islamists called on the country's citizens to boycott the poll saying it would be neither free nor fair.</p>
<p>Algeria has been without an elected parliament since January 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Moslem fundamentalists had taken a commanding lead. Violence erupted shortly afterwards and about 60,000 people have been killed.</p>
