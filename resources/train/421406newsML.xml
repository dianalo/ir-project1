<headline>OPINION - UNION BUDGET 1997/98 - DIL VIKAS FINANCE LTD.</headline>
<text>
<p>The following is the executive summary of a report titled &quot;Union Budget 1997-98 Analysis&quot; by Dil Vikas Finance Ltd</p>
<p>UNEXPECTED GIFT</p>
<p>The Finance Minister has been the recipient of open criticism by analysts and their ilk. Whilst everyone recognised his capacity as an individual, the compulsions of the political envelope around him led one to despair anout any good coming out of the budget. It is in this context that the budget for FY97-98 has come as a totally unexpected and pleasant gift.</p>
<p>There are several good things about the budget. First and foremost, the across the board reduction in excise and customs duty should arrest the declining trend in industrial growth. Lowering of tariffs would boost demand and also give relief to industry. The second most important aspect is the containment of fiscal deficit to well below the magic figure of 5% (though die hard skeptics would still wonder about the revenue targets being met through increased collection of taxation). However, this is a very right step and puts back the tariff reforms on track (after it was derailed in the budget of March 1995). The third most important factor is the direct taxation cuts across the board, which should help people to have higher disposable incomes and also increase the savings rate. He has continued his predecessor's policy of rationalising the tax structure, both in direct and indirect taxation.</p>
<p>RELUCTANCE TO RAISE OIL PRICES</p>
<p>The fundamental failure in this budget is the reluctance to hike oil prices as well as reduce subsidies. A host of schemes have been announced, to appease various factions of the government. Whilst the amounts committed are not large by themselves, such kind of schemes tend to bleed forever. Another omission is the lack of concrete plans and policy for infrastructure funding, especially in an environment, where ability to pay is not the criteria that would ensure commercial viability.</p>
<p>This budget is also a gamble in the sense that the drop in revenues caused by the broad cuts in direct and indirect taxation are sought to be compensated by increased compliance and overall buoyancy in the economy. Further, apart from modest cuts in import duties, excise duty cuts have not been widespread, but targeted at mass consumption items, with an eye on consumer price levels.</p>
<p>Before we get carried away with this budget, let us not forget that industry is today struggling with high operating costs due to inadequate infrastructure. The single most important reason for lack of investment in this sector is the capriciousness of the policies as well as the multiplicity of controls (centre, state, local bodies, regulatory agencies etc.,). The second reason is the unavailability of money at reasonable cost to the industry, due to preemption of resources through government borrowings. Unless this is addressed immediately, we cannot sustain economic growth of the order of six to seven percent per annum over the medium term.</p>
<p>A bold statement of commitment has been made by this budget. We hope that the same spirit continues in all issues which the government has to tackle in future. This budget also perhaps ensures the continuance of the UF government for longer than general expectations.</p>
<p>INCOME TAX CHANGES AND ITS IMPACT</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>** CORPORATE INCOME TAX</p>
<p>Firstly, the 7.5% surcharge on corporate tax has been abolished. Further, the rate of taxation has been brought down from 40% to 35%. Thus for tax paying companies, the maximum rate of taxation has been reduced from 43% (including surcharge) to 35%, a reduction of almost 20% in the tax outflow. This would naturally boost earnings of all tax paying companies. Further, minor changes such as doing away with disallowance to tax of expenses on travel, entertainment etc., would also increase the earnings of most companies.</p>
<p>As a universe, the MNC's are the biggest gainer. There are also several Indian companies, notably Bajaj Auto, which gains. A list of companies, which gain significatly by this reduction in the tax rate, is attached.</p>
<p>** MINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX</p>
<p>MAT stays. However, export earnings have been totally excluded from the purview of MAT. Companies with significant export turnover who came under the MAT in 96-97 (based on first half year results) is attached.</p>
<p>Consequent to the lowering of the tax rate and the abolishment of surcharge on income-tax, the effective MAT rate has dropped from 12.9% to 10.5%. Another notable feature of the new MAT is that the treatment is similar to an advance tax payment. MAT payments in future can be claimed as credit against future tax liabilities. All payments under MAT can be utilised to offset tax payments for a period of five years. If a company cannot utilise it within five years, the credit experies.</p>
<p>The accounting treatment (in respect of MAT) followed by companies would now be interesting to see. Theoretically, in future MAT can be treated as a payment of advance income tax and clubbed under loans and advance, without routing it through the profit and loss account. The charge to revenue would arise only if the company is unable to utilise its full credit of MAT paid within the limit of five years.</p>
<p>** PERSONAL TAXATION</p>
<p>Personal income tax rates have been lowered across the board. The maximum rate has been brought down from 40% to 30%. This is perhaps the most significant factor which could spur demand as well as increase the savings rate. Another notable feature is the increase in the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) contribution rate from 8.33% to 10%. This would also contribute to increase in savings rate.</p>
<p>** DOUBLE TAXATION ON DIVIDEND</p>
<p>The long standing demand for abolishment of double taxation on dividend has been acceded to in full. This is a very positive step for boosting investment in to equities. Companies paying dividend have to pay a tax equivalent to 10% of the total dividend payment. This cannot be deducted from the dividend which is paid to the shareholder. As this guideline is proposed to be made effective from June 1st, 1997 (i.e. any company declaring or paying dividend after this date), it would be interesting to see the policies which different companies would follow in respect of the dividend for the year ending March 31, 1997. Those that wish to avoid the 10% tax, would have to declare and pay dividends before this date. It is possible that some companies, pending finalisation of accounts, might declare &quot;interim&quot; dividend, to save this impost for the current year.  </p>
<p>The million dollar question is, would companies increase or reduce dividend payout in the light of this development? To our understanding, this would depend on the promoters' attitude and the extent of their shareholding. Where dividend is an important source of income, such promoters would opt to pay out higher dividends, as the income would be totally tax free in their hands. On the other hand, companies where there are no such compulsions, the dividend rate might be lowered. Of course, in future, shareholders are going to ask for more and more dividends.</p>
<p>The one major development would be the firming up of prices of mid cap and small cap companies shares' which have a high dividend yield. This can bring back the retail investor back to the market. An analysis done by us recently, showed that there were more than 200 companies with dividend yield in excess of 8%. A whole lot of finance companies are in this basket and we could witness an uptrend their prices based on dividend yield buying.</p>
<p>** AMNESTY SCHEME</p>
<p>The Finance Minister has introduced a scheme which seeks to bring in &quot;black money&quot; into the system. The scheme states that any individual or corporate, having evaded tax in the past, can declare such undisclosed income. The tax payable shall be 30% in case of individuals and 35% in case of others (corporates, firms, HUF etc.,). All one has to do is to pay the tax first and submit your declaration to the Income Tax authorities. An interesting feature of the scheme is rproduced below:</p>
<p>&quot;All particulars contained in a declaration will be treated as confidential and no court or authority will be entitled to require any public servant of the declarant to produce before it any such declaration or part thereof or to give any evidence in this regard.&quot;</p>
<p>A reading of the proposed scheme shows that it covers wealth/income which has been concealed either within or outside the country.</p>
<p>Who says, &quot;dishonesty does not pay&quot;?</p>
<p>CAPITAL MARKET BOOSTERS...</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>** Abolishment of double taxation on dividend should bring life back to small cap and mid cap company stocks. Further, primary issues (hopefully of better quality than we witnessed in 1994 till now) should also stage a comeback through this mechanism.</p>
<p>** Buy back of shares by companies to be introduced. We hope that there are enough safeguards in the guidelines to be framed, to protect us from rogue promoters.</p>
<p>** Increase in limit for FII (including NRI and OCB's) from 24% to 30% subject to approval from shareholders has been perceived to be favourable for the stock market. However, the number of companies which opt for this would not be very high, unless the management or the promoter has a large enough holding. The second factor is the company has to be of good quality to merit investment from FII's.</p>
<p>** The proposal to raise the intercorporate investment limit from 30% to 60% of the investing compay's net worth is seen to be a positive factor. However in the absence of equity accounting or consolidation of accounts, shareholders are unlikely to gain by this move. In fact, this would only help to create quasi holding companies and dilute returns to the sharholder and benefit promoters with minimal in one company which promotes a string of companies.</p>
<p>** Investor protection is sought to be enhanced, by making it obligatory for companies to disclose the end-use of funds in the form of annual statements from such companies which raise money through offerings.</p>
<p>** Stockbrokers give full remission in capital gains tax on corporatisation of membership in stock exchanges. As members become corporatised, it would help them in dealings with institutional clients by bringing about a greater degree of transparency.</p>
<p>** Venture capital funds given the freedom to invest up to 20% of their corpus in a single company, from the earlier limit of 5%. Given the small size of deals which are floating around, this is a welcome change and should encourage flow of capital through this route.</p>
<p>** Inclusion of oil exploration and industrial parks as &quot; infrastructure&quot; industries, intitling tax breaks to investors in this sector, should help invetment in to these sectors.</p>
<p>Apart from these specific measures, the tone of the budget proposals boosts investor sentiment considerably. A sense of well being has been unshered in through reduction in direct tax rates for both individuals and corporates. Further, the liberalisation in debit instruments (though banishment of TDS on secondary market debt deals as well as the exclusion ofinterest income on gilts, from income tax, up to a certain limit) should see a decline in interest rates. This should also encourge a shift to equities. The impact of the budget has already been felt in the post budget trading session, where the market has gained nearly 7% and the kerb rates are still higher.</p>
<p>SECTORAL AND POLICY REFORMS:</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>** INSURANCE SECTOR:  </p>
<p>Given the fact that the Left Front and the socialist factions have been vociferous about public sector monopolies remaining as they are, opening up of the insurance sector to competition was a non-starter. However, the Finance Minister has cleverly managed to put in a wedge. He has allowed private participation through joint ventures ralating to health insurance and pension fund management. Hitherto, pension funds were the exclusive domain of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). LIC is now permitted to promote joint ventures in the pension business. The Unit Trust of India has been permitted to enter this segment also. On the lines of LIC, the General Insurance Corporation (GIC</p>
<p>** COMPANIES ACT</p>
<p>A new Companies bill, seeking to replace the archaic Companies Act, 1956, is being tabled in the Parliament during the monsoon session. Prior to that, it would be distributed widely to ensure an open debate before framing the new Act.</p>
<p>** DIRECT TAXES BILL</p>
<p>On the lines of the Companies Act, a new direct taxes bill is proposed to be tabled in the Parliament in the winter session.</p>
<p>** CAPITAL ACCOUNT CONVERTIBILITY</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India is being asked to appoint a group of experts to prepare a comprehensive plan to make the rupee convertible on capital account. Wait and watch.</p>
<p>** FERA</p>
<p>Like other outdated legislature, a new replacement is being proposed to be introduced. A bill dealing with money laundering is also under preparation and is proposed to be tabled during the current parliament session.</p>
<p>** FISCAL DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>So far, the government has had the freedom to float &quot;Ad Hoc&quot; treasury bills, to meet temporary mismatch in receipt and payments. This instrument has been now abolished. Instead, the government would have to fall back on the Reserve Bank of India through a scheme styled as &quot;ways and means advances.&quot; this effectively brings a greater degree of discipline in fiscal reporting and management. Borrowings under this programme would henceforth be classified as monetised deficit.</p>
<p>** INDEXED BONDS</p>
<p>The government proposes to launch bonds where the repayment of principal amounts will be indexed to inflation. This could be taken as an indication of the government;s intention to contain inflation whilst at the same time offering protection to the investors. This instrument is likely to prove quite popular with the banks and high net worth individuals.</p>
<p>** TAXATION REFORMS These have been discussed in detail in the relevant chapters.</p>
<p>IMPACT OF THE BUDGET ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Budget definitely goes a long way in improving the sentiments of the capital market, and is bullish in nature. The budget focuses on improving savings and lowering inflation. The industrial sector demand should certainly get a boost. However, the key is the speed with which demand accelerates and the limitation on growth caused by inadequacy of infrastructure. Liquidity improvement can take some time and hence the pick up in industry could witness a time lag.</p>
<p>The results of the corporate sector for FY 96-97 is going to be poor and the weakness could extend through the first half of FY 97-98. By then, if the capital market revives, we could see a better second half. In terms of earnings growth, FY 96-97 is likely to be flat to negative as compared to FY 95-96. Therefore, we could witness some weakness in the markets around the result season, which should be around May/June 1997.</p>
<p>Oil pool deficit has not been addressed by the Finance Minister. The budget comes after the railway freight has been hiked by almost 23% in a span of eight months. Further global commodity prices have still not recovered.</p>
<p>The post budget session of trading on the bourses saw frenzied buying which ramped up the market by almost 7%. The budget has definitely put a higher floor on the indices. However, we are likely to witness high volatility in the coming week to a fortnight.</p>
<p>The budget has thrown benefits across the board to all industries through tax cuts. Excise and Import tariff changes have not had any major impact. The clear winners seem to be those in the business of consumer non-durables, personal care, aluminum and high tax paying companies. PSU's which form part of the nine &quot;chosen ones&quot; are good bets for the longer term.</p>
<p>The budget is also likely to spur higher FII allocations for Indian equities. Thus, on funds flow and sentiments, the market could climb to new heights. However, the corporate fundamentals have still to catch up and we would recommend cautious and careful stock seletion. Our focus would be on companies with high Return on Capital Employed and in safe sectors like consumer non-durables, personal care and gradual accumulation in commodity stocks. MNC stocks are the ones most likely to outperform the market over the medium term.</p>
<p>Right now, the market is in a state of euphoria and the mood is upbeat (At last!). This is also perhaps the time to look at good quality mid cap stocks, which would rally on the back of the heavyweights, as sentiment gets better.</p>
