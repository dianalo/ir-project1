<p>Jakarta call money was traded at 8.0/8.5 percent on Monday on ample liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said an early central bank injection of some 1.81 trillion rupiah seemed to flood the market. One dealer said the absence of value today trading due to a public holiday in the U.S. removed arbitrage opportunity with the swap market.</p>
<p>But one Japanese bank dealer said he would be cautious of upcoming tax payments as the amount might be higher due to the approaching end of the 1996/97 fiscal year on March 31.</p>
<p>He said businesses seemed to gradually return to normal after an extended Eid al-Fitr holiday last week.</p>
<p>Longer-term rates were edging down slightly from Friday due to ample rupiah supply. One- and three-month money were quoted at 13.00/13.25 and 13.75/14.00 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its rates for bilateral SBIs stable. It offered seven-day at nine percent, 14-day at 10.0 percent, one- and three-month at 11.25 and 12.0 percent.</p>
<p>The average overnight interbank rate on Friday was 10.1 percent, compared with 9.85 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said prices remained stable in slow trading.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark PLN V/A bond was steady at 15.37 percent at the price of 105.25 percent.</p>
