<title>TURKEY: Fugitive Asil Nadir in Turkey for business.</title>
<headline>Fugitive Asil Nadir in Turkey for business.</headline>
<dateline>ISTANBUL 1997-05-20</dateline>

<p>Fallen tycoon Asil Nadir has flown to Turkey on business in his first trip out of his native north Cyprus since he fled there from British justice four years ago, aides said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Asil Nadir is a Turkish citizen...he will carry out his business activities from here,&quot; Nadir's lawyer Mehmet Esinli told Reuters in Turkey.</p>
<p>An aide said Nadir flew from north Cyprus to Istanbul in a small jet on Monday. The north Cyprus daily Kibris, owned by Nadir, published a photograph of the former magnate boarding the plane.</p>
<p>Nadir jumped bail in Britain in May, 1993. He was awaiting trial on theft and false accounting charges related to the collapse of his Polly Peck lemons-to-electronics empire.</p>
<p>The British embassy in Ankara said it hoped Turkish police would arrest Nadir on the strength of an Interpol &quot;wanted&quot; notice.</p>
<p>&quot;We would expect the Turkish police to detain him as there is an Interpol red notice against him,&quot; an embassy spokesman said. &quot;We have reminded the Turkish authorities of the existence of this notice on a number of occasions.&quot;</p>
<p>But the lawyer said he does not expect any legal action against his client, who also holds a Turkish passport. &quot;No country has to give back one of its own citizens to another country, we do not see any problem,&quot; Esinli said.</p>
<p>Britain does not have an extradition treaty with Turkey.</p>
<p>Nadir is staying at an Istanbul hotel overlooking the Bosphorus Strait and will attend some business meetings in the city, his secretary said. Aides did not say what the nature of Nadir's business in Turkey was.</p>
<p>The London Times said earlier this month that Serious Fraud Office policemen had been sent to Turkey to seek Nadir's arrest after the businessman said he would fly to Istanbul.</p>
