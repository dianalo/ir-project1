<p>Brewer Grolsch NV, reporting a meagre rise in 1996 profits, said on Wednesday it expected results in 1997 to be lower than in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The result in 1996 has been influenced positively by an incidental gain, for this reason we see the result in 1997 not equalling the 1996 result,&quot; Grolsch said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The company said in several important beer markets it saw insufficient room to raise selling prices during 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Also the higher investment level, of great importance to the company's future, will lead to higher depreciation costs and increasing interest charges,&quot; said Grolsch.</p>
<p>But it added it had a strong market position in the Netherlands, a higher contribution from the Polish unit and a rising contribution to group profits from exports.</p>
<p>Currency effects were expected to be more favourable than in 1996, the company added.  </p>
<p>The company said it expected to invest some 87 million guilders across the company, except in Poland, in plant and financial fixed assets.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the cash flow and available liquid assets we don't expect to call on the capital markets,&quot; Grolsch added.</p>
<p>The company earlier announced 1996 net profit scraped to 59.9 million guilders from 58.8 million, at the lower end of analysts' forecasts of 59.2 million to 66.9 million guilders. The 1996 net figure included a one-off net gain of six million guilders.</p>
