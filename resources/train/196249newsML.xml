<title>MEXICO: Mexican leftist killed after party wins election.</title>
<headline>Mexican leftist killed after party wins election.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-11-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The leftist Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) on Monday said one of its local officials was shot and killed by a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) a week after local elections the PRI lost.</p>
<p>The PRD said Agustin Linares Castro, a local party boss, was shot at an outdoor food stand on Sunday after an argument with his PRI opponent Arnulfo Garcia Gutierrez. The killing took place in the small town of Tenango del Aire in the state of Mexico, surrounding Mexico City, where the PRD won the mayoral race on Nov. 10.</p>
<p>Garcia &quot;presumably was upset with the electoral results,&quot; the PRD said in a statement. PRI officials confirmed the killing but denied it was for political reasons.</p>
<p>The PRI, which has governed Mexico for 67 uninterrupted years, suffered deep setbacks in the important state of Mexico in the local elections but retained a majority of town halls.</p>
<p>The PRD and the conservative National Action Party (PAN) cut deeply into the PRI's dominance of city governments throughout the state in polls that were seen as a dress rehearsal for landmark Mexico City elections next year.</p>
