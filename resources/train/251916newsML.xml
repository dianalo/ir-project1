<p>Brazil's coffee export quota in first half 1997 should remain six million 60-kg bags despite the fact African and Colombian officials feel there is a need to reduce exports further, a growers' representative said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think to at least fulfill our quota of six million bags is very important,&quot; said Manoel Bertone, vice-president of the National Coffee Council which represents growers.</p>
<p>An African delegation is to meet tomorrow with Brazilian government officials after the six-member delegation held talks yesterday with Colombian coffee officials in Bogota.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the representatives issued a statement saying they believed exports in the January to June period by members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) should be further reduced by around 2.5 million bags.</p>
<p>Traders in Brazil have already expressed their concern over any reduction in Brazil's six-million bag quota and producers also would have little to gain from any cut, Bertone said.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers have already sold their coffee,&quot; Bertone said.</p>
<p>&quot;This statement is a clear demonstration that current prices are unacceptable for countries such as Colombia as they are for Brazil,&quot; Bertone said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it also shows these countries (Colombia and African nations) have some worries about how much they have to sell as otherwise they would not be suggesting cuts that would cost them money in storing coffee,&quot; he added.</p>
