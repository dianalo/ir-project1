<title>GERMANY: Money tight for German defence investment - Ruehe.</title>
<headline>Money tight for German defence investment - Ruehe.</headline>
<dateline>BONN 1996-10-09</dateline>

<p>German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe, his procurement plans under pressure from budget cuts, said on Wednesday he would only back military investments if they were absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Ruehe told parliament's defence committee he was still locked in tough talks on buying the Eurofighter 2000 combat jet. He did not commit himself to a Franco-German satellite project and said a helicopter programme should be postponed.</p>
<p>There was still &quot;a big gap&quot; between the planned costs of producing Eurofighter and the state funds available, Ruehe told the committee.</p>
<p>Negotiations on making a decision to buy Eurofighter are entering a crunch phase as parliamentary debates on the 1997 austerity budget are due to wind up in November.</p>
<p>No budget money has yet been earmarked even though production is scheduled to start on January 1 -- and Germany is under pressure to make a firm Eurofighter order this year after Britain announced its intention to buy 232 of the combat jets.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa), a contractor in the four-country project, also warned on Tuesday that project costs could escalate if Germany fails to order its planned 180 aircraft this year. It said 18,000 jobs were at risk.</p>
<p>Dasa has a 30 percent stake in the Eurofighter project, with British Aerospace holding 37.5 percent, Alenia SpA on 19 percent and Spain's CASA with 13 percent.</p>
<p>Germany's Handelsblatt financial daily said the original sale offer presented in March by the Eurofighter consortium -- worth around 100 million marks apiece in 1995 prices -- foresaw delivery of the first aircraft in 2001.</p>
<p>Handelsblatt also quoted an industry newsletter which said the Eurofighter consortium had suggested delaying production for a year. Costs would be 372 million marks in 1997, rising to 1.5 billion marks in 2001.</p>
<p>The government offer for 1997 is just 100 million marks, rising to 850 million in 2000, leaving a hefty gap still to be closed.</p>
<p>With Eurofighter taking priority over other procurement projects, the outlook for cooperation in the space and helicopter sectors looks doubtful. Germany also recently said it was dropping plans to buy the French Apache cruise missile.</p>
<p>Ruehe declined to comment on the outlook for the Franco-German Helios 2/Horus satellite, although he said talks on the satellite navigations system were continuing.</p>
<p>The French government has said it was determined to go ahead with the project after receiving assurances from Chancellor Helmut Kohl that Germany would give its backing.</p>
<p>Ruehe also said that the production phase of the Tiger combat helicopter should be postponed by a year to 2001, meaning that the German armed forces would take delivery of the first 50-60 choppers in 2006.</p>
<p>Ruehe said that the NH90 helicopter should, however, be brought into service as planned in 2003, with between 60 and 70 in service by 2006.</p>
