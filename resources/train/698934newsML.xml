<headline>Israel's Sharon rules out meeting with Arafat.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hawkish Israeli cabinet minister Ariel Sharon on Tuesday ruled out a meeting with Yasser Arafat on the heels of talks with a senior PLO official close to the Palestinian leader.</p>
<p>&quot;I always said I am willing to meet Palestinians. With Arafat I was not willing to meet, I am not willing to meet and I will not be willing to meet,&quot; Sharon told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>A media disclosure last week that Sharon, among the government's fiercest opponents of peacemaking with the PLO, had secretly met Palestinian peace architect Mahmoud Abbas shocked his right-wing allies.</p>
<p>Other Israelis speculated Sharon, 69, was trying to soften his hardline image to facilitate his promotion to finance minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.</p>
<p>The burly ex-general has been a champion of Jewish settlement expansion in occupied lands. The United States and the Arab world view settlements as an obstacle to peace.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO signed a landmark 1993 peace accord after decades of enmity but peacemaking has suffered setbacks since Netanyahu, who opposed the 1993 interim deal, was elected 13 months ago.</p>
