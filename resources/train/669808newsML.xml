<p>Mexican tequila magnate Jesus Lopez Roman was shot in the head and killed on Tuesday in his car, the state attorney general's office said.</p>
<p>&quot;He was assasinated this morning ... the victim of various shots from 0.45 and 0.38 caliber pistols when in his car,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Local media reports said he was shot 13 times total from both pistols while in a one-year-old BMW.</p>
<p>Lopez Roman, about 54 years old, was owner of tequila brands Tequila San Matias and Tequila Pueblo Viego.</p>
<p>Last year his company ranked fifth in national sales and sixth in exports of tequila made 100 percent from agave, the cactus-like plant that produces the potent drink.</p>
<p>Police said three or four gunmen fled the scene in a stolen car.</p>
<p>&quot;It is still being investigated whether the crime was because the victim resisted the theft of his car or if there was another motive,&quot; the statement said.</p>
