<p>Timothy McVeigh was formally sentenced to die on Thursday for the Oklahoma City bombing and in a brief statement, the self-proclaimed patriot indicated the blast was to protest against what he viewed as a tyrannical government.</p>
<p>Moments before U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch sentenced him to death for the April 19, 1995, bombing that killed 168 people, McVeigh broke the silence that he kept, except for a few words, throughout his 11-week trial.</p>
<p>In a low tone that had a packed court straining to hear, McVeigh read a one-sentence quote from the late liberal U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis: &quot;Our government is the potent and omnipresent teacher for good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's all I have to say,&quot; he added, standing ramrod straight and dressed in prison garb. The decorated Gulf War veteran's hands were clasped behind his back.</p>
<p>During the trial, his attorneys argued that McVeigh was a patriot deeply worried about government attacks on individual rights.</p>
<p>They described the explosion, which brought political terror to America's heartland, as an act of revenge for the bloody April 19, 1993, government showdown with the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, that left 80 people dead.</p>
<p>While McVeigh had pleaded innocent, during the sentencing phase of the trial, his attorneys tried to explain the bombing by dwelling on his anger against the government and especially on what happened at Waco.</p>
<p>&quot;He is not a demon, though surely his act was demonic,&quot; chief defense attorney Stephen Jones said in his closing argument in the sentencing phase, which ended with a jury voting that McVeigh should be executed.</p>
<p>McVeigh's quote from Brandeis left many people in the courtroom dissatisfied, especially relatives of those killed in the explosion at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building.</p>
<p>McVeigh had told the Buffalo News in an interview that he would speak and many hoped he would shed new light on the case and give a full explanation of his actions.</p>
<p>Marsha Kight, whose 23-year-old daughter was killed in the bombing said she was disappointed that McVeigh took his rare opportunity to speak by chosing someone else's words.</p>
<p>The quote McVeigh read came from a dissenting opinion in a wiretap case from the 1920s.</p>
<p>McVeigh's lawyers said they preferred not to try to interpret why McVeigh chose the words of Brandeis.</p>
<p>Diane Leonard, the wife of secret service agent Donald Leonard, who was killed in the bombing, saw McVeigh's statement as laying blame for what happened on the government.</p>
<p>&quot;That's where his idea of blame has come from from the beginning. I think that's what he has in his mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Courtroom spectators also had expected McVeigh to possibly say something about his chief attorney, Jones. In the Buffalo News interview, McVeigh accused Jones of botching his defense.</p>
<p>Instead, McVeigh wrote a one-page letter to Matsch in which he expressed his unhappiness with Jones and noted that the judge was &quot;aware of the problems and difficulties I have had with my appointed counsel in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>He said if Jones must remain on the case than at least he would like his other defense lawyers Richard Burr and Robert Nigh to be appointed as co-appellate counsel.</p>
<p>In the courtroom McVeigh sat two chairs from Jones and between Nigh and Burr. Jones and McVeigh did not shake hands when McVeigh was escorted into the courtroom.</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom, Jones did not criticize his client and said it was up to the court to decide if he should remain on the case. &quot;My own personal wish in the matter must yield to what the court wants.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to disclose whether there was any tension between him and his client, saying it would be inappropriate to comment. But Jones did say that he had already filed a notice of appeal of McVeigh's conviction.</p>
<p>Under federal rules, when all appeals have been exhausted in the case, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno would turn McVeigh over to the federal marshals and an execution date would be picked by the director of the Bureau of Prisons, a Justice Department spokesman said.</p>
