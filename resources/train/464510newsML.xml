<p>Romania urged the European Union on Monday to open talks with all the central and eastern European countries queueing up for membership at the same time.</p>
<p>Whether to open talks with all the 10 applicants, or just those that are properly prepared, is one of the EU's most pressing long-term foreign policy dilemmas.</p>
<p>The EU intends to open talks six months after the close of its current inter-governental review of its workings designed to prepare the 15-nation bloc for the day it has around 25 members.</p>
<p>&quot;We do hope that within six months all the candidate countries will be able to start the negotiations at the same moment,&quot; Romania's Foreign Affairs Minister Adrian Severin told a news conference after meeting EU foreign ministers.</p>
<p>He said that while talks should start at the same time for all countries, each one should be admitted as soon as it has met the criteria for EU membership laid down by EU leaders.</p>
<p>Romania, along with Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Bulgaria have all applied for EU membership.</p>
<p>The EU's External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek told the joint news conference that after previous governments in Romania had let the economic reform process necessary for EU membership slip, the new government had given it a new impulse.</p>
<p>&quot;We very much welcome the new impetus given by this government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>EU foreign ministers, meeting informally in the Dutch town of Apeldoorn recently, agreed in principle to a standing conference on EU enlargement as a possible way of involving those not deemed ready for immediate membership talks.</p>
