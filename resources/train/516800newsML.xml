<p>Zimbabwean shares were buoyant on Thursday on the back of improved liquidity on the stock market which is expected to continue bullish next week after the independence holiday.</p>
<p>The key industrial index leapt 117.86 points -- or 1.1 percent -- to close at 10,575.32.</p>
<p>&quot;There's basically a good deal of liquidity coming onto the market and we expect this trend to continue into next week,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Some brokers however said a rise in year-on-year inflation to 19.9 percent in March from 19 percent in February might put a dampener on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;If this trend of rising inflation continues we might see money flowing from equities to the money market with people anticipating higher interest rates,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>The brokers said the day's main focus was on local merchant banker, the National Merchant Bank, saying its debut on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange on Thursday created much excitement and intense trading.</p>
<p>The bank's shares traded in a range of 3,200 to 3,500 cents at the opening in volumes of around 1.2 million shares before settling back at 3,300 cents.</p>
<p>Among the day's winners on the exchange, pharmaceutical group Caps rose 100 cents to 1,650 while tyre retreader NTS, cement producer Porthold and farming implement -maker Zimplow each climbed 50 cents to 450, 1,750 and 800 respectively.</p>
<p>Minings remained quiet with gold producer Falgold up three cents to 68. The mining index edged up 1.50 points to 1,025.32.</p>
