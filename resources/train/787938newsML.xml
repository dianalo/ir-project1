<headline>TCI say operating cash flow rises in second quarter.</headline>

<p>Tele-Communications, Inc., the nation's biggest cable operator, said Friday its operating cash flow rose 16 percent in the second quarter, reflecting lower operating costs and improved profit margins.</p>
<p>The company said its operating cash flow totalled $706 million in the period on revenues of $1.6 billion, up from $609 million on revenues of $1.5 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>TCI, based in Englewood, Colo., only reported preliminary results Friday. It plans to release its final quarterly earnings on Aug. 13.</p>
<p>The company said its revenue growth stemmed primarily from scheduled rate increases, strong pay-per-view events and increased advertising sales.</p>
<p>TCI President Leo Hindery said the company will spend about $100 million on marketing in the second half of the year. The company spent $25 million on marketing in the second quarter and only $14 million in the first quarter, which Hindery called &quot;pitiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I don't get subs (subscribers) in the fourth quarter I'm going to kill myself,&quot; Hindery told reporters on a conference call.</p>
<p>&quot;We know how to market cable around here. We just didn't do it,&quot; he added, referring to the lower marketing budget earlier in the year.</p>
<p>TCI will spend $53 million on marketing in the third quarter and $50 million in the final quarter, he said.</p>
<p>Hindery blamed the loss of 89,000 cable customers in the second quarter on seasonal factors, such as college students going home and disconnecting their cable service, and on customer dissatisfaction over rate increases.</p>
<p>Hindery said he assumed that customers who were lost to a competitor were going to direct broadcast satellite (DBS) because &quot;I always believe the worst.&quot; He vowed not to lose any more customers to DBS.</p>
<p>TCI ended the quarter with about 14,198,000 customers.</p>
<p>The company also said it plans to use its longer-term free cash flow to reduce its debt and to buy back its stock and invest in opportunities. It defined free cash flow as operating cash flow minus interest, capital expenditures and preferred dividends.</p>
<p>TCI stock rose 44 cents to end at $18.06 on Nasdaq.</p>
