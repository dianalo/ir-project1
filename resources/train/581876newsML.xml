<p>Lineout lessons dished out to the Wellington Hurricanes by Auckland last Saturday will be taken on board for Sunday's crucial Super 12 rugby match against the ACT Brumbies at Athletic Park this Sunday.</p>
<p>The Blues' ability to drive players from lineouts just short of the line produced two tries, an important factor in Auckland's 45-42 win.</p>
<p>Auckland do not contest opposition lineout throws in similar positions, preferring instead to be set and ready to repel attacks.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'll be having a look at that,&quot; said Hurricanes coach Frank Oliver.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of having two players jumping and several others lifting, Auckland has players set firmly waiting to fight off the drive. That makes it easier to stop the drive.</p>
<p>&quot;And when they drive, Auckland have players coming in from deep to add impetus after the jump. That makes it hard to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Main interest at the Hurricanes' training session centred on lock Dion Waller, who says he is ready to take the field again after making a good recovery from his medial ligament strain.  </p>
<p>Oliver, however, is likely to have Waller on the reserves bench rather than give him a starting position against ACT.</p>
<p>Injured blindside flanker Chresten Davis will be replaced by either Kevin Barrett or Finau Maka. The latter's ability as an impact player might swing the starting berth in Barrett's favour.</p>
<p>Oliver has been a talented user of the substitute law, but admits he almost got caught short in Auckland when No 8 Filo Tiatia went down with cramp near the end of the game.  </p>
<p>&quot;The only one (reserve) we had left was Richard Jarman (halfback), and if he went on we probably would have had to put (winger) Tana Umaga on the side of the scrum.&quot;</p>
<p>At that stage, spare hooker Tala Leiasamaivao was already on as a loose forward.</p>
<p>Oliver  also will be working on ball maintenance, which was occasionally shabby in Auckland.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got to get more numbers to the ball breakdown. We're fit enough, but maybe it's a matter of the players looking, and then running, rather than running, then looking.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hurricanes team will be named later today.  </p>
<p>ACT Brumbies: Stephen Larkham, Mitch Hardy, James Holbeck, Joe Roff, Pat Howard, David Knox, George Gregan, Troy Coker, Brett Robinson (captain), David Giffin, John Langford, Owen Finegan, Ewen McKenzie, Marco Caputo, Patricio Noriega. Reserves: Rod Kafer, Geoff Logan, Ipolito Fenukitau, Justin Harrison, Dean Zammit, Timote Tavalea.</p>
