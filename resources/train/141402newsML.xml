<p>Ireland's fiscal prudence will give the country a strong chance of joining a single European currency at the planned 1999 start date, credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's said on Thursday.</p>
<p>S&amp;P, which affirmed the Republic of Ireland's sovereign credit ratings, said it was putting greater emphasis on government finances in analysing countries which could take part in European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;Ireland's comparatively strong fiscal position leaves it well placed to be among the first to join,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>A single European currency, one of the main features of EMU, is due to be introduced on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>S&amp;P affirmed its AA long-term foreign currency and A1 plus short-term ratings on Ireland, as well as its AAA local currency rating. The outlook on the ratings is stable, the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ratings are based on the Republic's adherence to prudent fiscal and other macroeconomic policies, which have significantly reduced the public debt burden and created the conditions for relatively fast economic growth and low inflation,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>Over the medium term, sustained containment of budget deficits and continued economic growth should lead to further cuts of a still-heavy public debt burden and a fall in high unemployment rates, the agency said.</p>
<p>The AAA local currency rating reflects a stronger capacity to pay Irish pound-denominated debt than foreign currency debt because of the country's taxation powers and control of the domestic financial system.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said Ireland has benefited from EU membership, attracting foreign direct investment and official transfers,</p>
<p>It said the country had a track record of prudent policies. Average inflation had slowed to 2.4 percent last year from more than four percent in 1989 and the public deficit had been cut to an average of 2.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from double-digit levels in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>But S&amp;P said the foreign currency rating was constrained by a level of economic development that trailed the average for EU countries and a still high, though declining, public debt burden.</p>
<p>Ireland's general government debt peaked in 1986 at 118 percent of GDP and has fallen sharply since then.</p>
<p>&quot;It remains high at 80 percent of GDP, leaving the country somewhat vulnerable to shifts in economic conditions,&quot; S&amp;P added.</p>
