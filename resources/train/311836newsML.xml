<p>Home decor and consumer products company Roly International Holdings Ltd said on Thursday its interim profit fell 25 percent to US$6.7 million, but it expected to do better in the second half.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that growth in turnover was mainly due to the increase in sales of home decorative products in North America, and from new subsidiaries such as Toonsland Ltd in Hong Kong, and Porth Innovations Ltd in Britain.  </p>
<p>But turnover was lower than expected in Europe and North America in the first half of the year ending October, and together with higher business development costs, resulted in a decrease in profit.</p>
<p>The statement said Roly would continue to look for growth in Asia for its children's consumer products.</p>
<p>The joint venture agreement with Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation to identify new business concepts for retail, educational and family entertainment in Asia would enhance the group's earning base in the medium-to-long term, it said.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the group would continue to expand its consumer products in China, Hong Kong, Macau and the Middle East, as these markets provide growth opportunities.</p>
<p>It said that barring any unforseen circumstances, the group expected to improve its performance in the second-half of the financial year ending March.</p>
