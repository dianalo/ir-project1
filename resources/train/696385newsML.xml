<p>The bankrupt owners of a power plant said Monday they will miss a July 1 debt payment on $128.5 million of Palm Beach County bonds, setting up the largest muncipal bond default in Florida and one of the top 10 nationally.</p>
<p>Bondholders were notified that the plant owners, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in May, will not make the $4.6 million debt service payment Tuesday, even though a reserve fund could cover the payment, said John Sullivan, a spokesman for the owners.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel it is in the best interest of the estate and all its creditors, which I would emphasise includes the bondholders, to retain these funds at this time,&quot; Sullivan said.</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn't mean the payment won't be made at some point,&quot; he added. &quot;Our judgment was that it's still very early in the bankruptcy process and, therefore, it's only prudent in our view that we protect our collateral at this stage.&quot;</p>
<p>The bonds that will default are $120.5 million of Osceola Power Limited Partnership Project, tax-exempt series 1994 A, and $8 million of Osceola Power Limited Partnership Project, taxable Series 1994 B.</p>
<p>Sullivan said no decision had been made on whether the owners will make the Aug. 15 debt service payment on a third series of bonds used to finance a second power plant.</p>
<p>If that $5.4 million payment is also missed, another $160 million of Palm Beach County bonds will default. That issue is Okeelanta Power Limited Partnership Project, Series 1993A.</p>
<p>All three series of bonds have been in technical default since the partnerships sought Chapter 11 protection in May, but previously no payment had been missed.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody knew they weren't going to make the payment. That's why they filed for bankruptcy, so they wouldn't have to make the payment,&quot; said Patrick Smith, managing editor of the Defaulted Bonds Newsletter.</p>
<p>The plants are owned by the Okeelanta Power and Osceola Power Limited Partnerships. The partnerships are owned by affiliates of PG&amp;E Corp, Bechtel Enterprises and Flo-Sun Inc.</p>
<p>Flo-Sun, one of Florida's largest sugarcane growers, has no liability toward the bonds, Sullivan said. Nor does Palm Beach County have any liability toward the unrated bonds, County Debt Manager John Long said.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the owners had worked closely with the bondholders and &quot;we would certainly hope to maintain a dialogue with them.&quot;</p>
<p>The plants produce electricty by burning waste products from sugarcane processing.</p>
<p>The partnerships filed for bankruptcy protection after the plants' only customer, Florida Power &amp; Light Co., terminated contracts to buy electricity from them.</p>
<p>Florida Power &amp; Light, a unit of FPL Group, claimed that the plants had frequently shut down, in violation of contracts.</p>
