<title>SWEDEN: Man jailed for spying on Moroccans in Sweden.</title>

<text>
<p>A 52-year-old naturalised Swede, originally from Morocco, was jailed for eight months on Monday for spying on Moroccans in Sweden who opposed the Rabat government.</p>
<p>The man, who held a position of trust in a Moroccan organisation in Sweden for many years, was found guilty of sending information back to Morocco about the activities of Polisario supporters to the authorities in Rabat.</p>
<p>Polisario is an organisation campaigning for autonomy for the Western Sahara.</p>
<p>A court in Gothenburg on Sweden's west coast, heard that the man was charged after Swedish security police tapped the man's phone and kept him under surveillance for several years.</p>
<p>The defendent, who cannot be named under Swedish law, has lived in Sweden for 30 years.</p>
<p>He occasionally sent information through diplomatic channels using the Moroccan embassy in Sweden, the court was told during the month-long trial.</p>
<p>The court was also shown Swedish television news reports and newspaper articles about the political situation in Morocco to prove that supporting Polisario was a punishable offence there.</p>
<p>The defendent admitted forwarding Swedish media reports about Morocco to Rabat but said this did not amount to the charge he faced of illegal information gathering.</p>
