<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, fresh from agreeing spending cuts to help Germany qualify for European monetary union, faced criticism on Monday for slashing its jobs budget despite soaring unemployment.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel got his way when the coalition endorsed a pact agreed on Sunday night by party leaders approving three billion marks ($2 billion) in savings, after feuding which at one point provoked Kohl to threaten to quit.</p>
<p>Waigel said on Monday the coalition agreed to new budget cuts that would hold the level of new debt in 1997 to less than 56.5 billion marks ($38 billion) -- well beneath the three percent of gross domestic product limit to qualify for European monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;We assume we have reliable data for next year and it looks like there is no danger (of the deficit rising above three percent),&quot; he told ZDF television network in an interview, adding that the goal was 2.5 percent. &quot;We have a safety buffer built in. It will not be 2.9 percent or 2.8 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>But the budget cuts quickly stirred protest. A billion marks in cuts will come out of the Federal Labour Office budget, prompting the office's chief, Bernhard Jagoda, to warn that would hit job schemes and lead to longer dole queues.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to save money on job creation measures because that will put more people out of work -- and they would have to receive unemployment benefits,&quot; Jagoda said.</p>
<p>German unemployment hit a seasonally adjusted four million in October, the highest since the country was unified in 1990. Jagoda warned of a &quot;winter mountain&quot; of jobless still to come.</p>
<p>Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy head of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB), said every eighth job scheme would have to be scrapped if planned federal transfers were not doubled to six billion marks ($4 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;That would be a catastrophic scorched-earth jobs policy,&quot; Engelen-Kefer told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper, adding that depressed eastern Germany would be hardest hit.</p>
<p>Ingrid Matthaeus-Meier, the opposition Social Democrat (SPD) spokeswoman on finance, said higher future unemployment would open wider gaps in Waigel's budget plans.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has to save 10 billion marks, not three billion,&quot; she told Germany's Southwest Radio.</p>
<p>A final vote on the budget is expected later this month -- but critical decisions on cutting a tax raised to pay for east German reconstruction and on procuring the Eurofighter combat jet now have been put back to December.</p>
<p>After several turbulent weeks in which his tax plans had been wrecked by the SPD, and tax increase blocked by the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior coaliton partner, Waigel seemed to have regained control over policy late last week.</p>
<p>But the opposition is still saying that Waigel's arithmetic will unravel again.</p>
<p>Waigel's other cuts will come from defence (200 million marks), transport (450 million), economics (260 million), and research (160 million) with smaller savings being spread over other ministries.</p>
