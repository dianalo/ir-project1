<title>USA: NYS Gov gets sales tax pact with Native Americans.</title>
<headline>NYS Gov gets sales tax pact with Native Americans.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York State Gov George Pataki on Monday said he had agreed on an interim pact with Native American tribes, who faced an April 1 deadline for collecting gasoline and cigarette taxes from outsiders.</p>
<p>While the agreements do not require the Native Americans, whose reservations' tax-exempt status has boosted their sales of gasoline and cigarettes, to make direct payments to Albany, convienence stores, who had sued the state to force it to collect taxes on those products, should see their sales rise, the governor explained, in prepared remarks.  </p>
<p>Pataki said he reached 30-day agreements with the Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora, Tonawanda Seneca and Cayuga Indian Nations that will force them to collect motor fuel and cigarette taxes if long-term agreements have not been signed when the pacts end. Talks continue with other tribes: the Seneca, St. Regis Mohawks, the Shinnecock and the Poospatuck.</p>
<p>Under the pact, the five tribes will raise the prices of cigarettes sold on their reservations to as a first step in getting &quot;an acceptable level of parity,&quot; he said, in prepared remarks. The Oneida also agreed to do the same for gasoline.</p>
<p>Further, the Onondaga, Tonawanda Seneca, Tuscarora and Cayuga Indian Nations agreed to stop selling motor fuel. They are holding separate talks with the Independent Producers of Petroleum to get tribal pumps at nearby off-reservation stations so that their members can continue to buy the fuel without paying taxes. No estimates on how much new business the convienence stores will get can be made until the final pacts are approved, Pataki said. Initial data had showed Albany was losing $110 million a year in revenues by not collecting the taxes.</p>
<p>The Native American tribes also agreed not to sell cigarettes through the Internet or through the mail, and to enact licensing procedures for transporters, wholesalers and Indian retailers who make, ship, wholesale or sell cigarettes, gasoline and diesel fuel. New York State, which was concerned that forcing the Native Americans to collect the taxes might provoke violent resistance, said the individual nations will hold hearings on any alleged violations and set penalties, including revoking a license.</p>
