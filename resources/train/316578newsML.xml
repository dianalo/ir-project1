<p>German Susi Erdmann won her third luge world championship gold medal on Saturday, edging out compatriot and title-holder Jana Bode by 45 hundredths of a second.</p>
<p>Erdmann, who also triumphed at the 1989 and 1991 world championships, became the first women to clock a time below the 40 seconds mark on the Igls track which hosted the 1964 and 1976 Olympic luge events.</p>
<p>Erdmann was the first to smash the women's course record at Igls when she posted a fastest first run time of 39.945. In the second leg, she clocked the second best time of 39.986 for a winning aggregate of one minute 19.931 seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;I am so happy that I managed to win a gold again after such a long time,&quot; said Erdmann, the 1992 European champion.</p>
<p>&quot;Now my goal is to do well in Nagano. At the (1998) Olympics I definately want to make a medal,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Austria's 1992 Olympic champion Angelika Neuner clinched bronze in 1:19.988 while her compatriots Tobias and Markus Schiegl successfully defended their title in the doubles.</p>
<p>The Schiegl cousins, who on Friday helped Austria win the team competition, clocked a winning total time of 1:19.732 for their fourth world championship gold medal.</p>
<p>The German pairings of Stefan Krausse/Jan Behrendt (1:19.777) and Steffen Skel/Steffen Woeller (1:19.809) took silver and bronze respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;I never dreamed we would be able to win four medals today,&quot; said delighted German coach Thomas Schwab.</p>
<p>Germany placed five in the top seven in the women's event -- in which 41 athletes from 15 countries participated -- with Sylke Otto fourth, Barbara Niedernhuber sixth and Sylke Kraushaar seventh.</p>
