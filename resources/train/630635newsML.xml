<p>Several thousand South Korean students wielding metal pipes and firebombs clashed with riot police on Monday in the fourth day of protests to demand the resignation of President Kim Young-sam, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Violence broke out as marching students approached the gates of Hanyang University and were blocked by squadrons of riot police.  </p>
<p>Later, a Reuter photographer on the scene said a large number of students and riot police were injured during fierce fighting when marchers broke through police lines.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of policemen are lying on the street, and they seem badly hurt,&quot; Yun Suk-bong said.</p>
<p>In addition, he said students had seized about 10 officers and were holding them outside the college gates where some 3,000 students were massing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors on Monday vowed to &quot;deal sternly&quot; with the worst student violence in almost a year.</p>
