<title>BELGIUM: JP MORGAN MOVES OLO/DSL TRADE TO LONDON.</title>
<headline>JP MORGAN MOVES OLO/DSL TRADE TO LONDON.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>JP Morgan said on Monday it would move trading in Dutch and Belgian fixed income securities to London from Brussels in the course of the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;We will remain a primary dealer in Belgian government bonds (OLOs) and a special agent in Dutch government bonds (DSLs),&quot; spokesman Denis Peeters said in reply to queries.</p>
<p>The move was triggered by reduced volatilities and volumes. &quot;This induced us to shift trading from Brussels.&quot;</p>
<p>JP Morgan aims to complete the move by September.</p>
<p>The bank would continue to offer advisory, capital market government bond distribution, derivatives support services and credit products and risk management products to clients in Luxembourg and Belgium from Brussels.</p>
<p>The 30-odd staff involved would either be offered jobs in London or at other offices or at the Euroclear operations centre in Brussels which JP Morgan operates. Peeters gave no indications of the cost of the operation.</p>
<p>The move follows changes in the primary dealers' rule book to adapt it to the European Investment Services Directive, which allows banks and brokerages authorised on their domestic markets to offer financial services in other EU states.</p>
<p>The changes implied that it was hard for the Belgian Treasury to continue to demand that primary dealers had to be based in Belgium or Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In the wake of January's move by the Brussels branch of Deutsche Bank AG , one of the current 15 primary dealers, of most of its OLO trading to London there had been calls to adjust the rule-book and allow other foreign-based banks to operate as primary dealers from abroad.</p>
<p>The primary dealer system, set up in 1991, requires selected dealers to make a market in OLOs by continuously quoting bid and ask prices. They are allowed to take part in the Treasury's non-competitive OLO and Treasury bill auctions and enjoy a prefer ential relationship with the central bank.</p>
