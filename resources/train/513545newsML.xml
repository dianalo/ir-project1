<p>Gov. Lawton Chiles on Wednesday his state was a long way from a settlement with tobacco giants R.J. Reynolds and Philip Morris and Florida's Medicaid lawsuit would go forward as planned.</p>
<p>At a news conference in the state capital, Chiles confirmed that Florida Attorney-General Bob Butterworth was involved in negotiations with the tobacco companies. But he said the state's $1 billion lawsuit, scheduled for trial in West Palm Beach in August, would not be derailed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is a small step along a long and very uncertain path,&quot; Chiles said of the negotiations. &quot;From what I can understand, we are a long way from a settlement agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Butterworth is one of 22 state attorneys-general suing tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp and Philip Morris Cos Inc, seeking to recoup costs of treating sick smokers.</p>
<p>Several attorneys general said Wednesday they were negotiating with tobacco executives on a possible settlement of massive litigation against the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been meeting quite a bit, we know that,&quot; Chiles said. &quot;I'm sure they have made some kind of progress.&quot;</p>
<p>In order for Florida to consider a settlement, Chiles said, tobacco companies would have to make drastic changes in marketing and drop advertising aimed at children. &quot;We just have to be assured that children would not only not be targeted, but that they would be protected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Until the childrens' issue is settled, no agreement would be possible, he said. &quot;That's our number one concern. We have to be satisfied with that before we talk about the liability angles and some of the other things.&quot;</p>
<p>A settlement would also probably involve some type of immunity for the tobacco companies in return for payments over a 20-30 year period, he said.</p>
