<p>Sales at retail stores barely edged up in March after two booming sales months at the start of the year, the Commerce Department said on Friday.</p>
<p>Total retail sales rose last month by 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $215.6 billion after revised increases of 1.5 percent in February and 1.7 percent in January. An unexpected drop in sales by auto dealers -- after their strongest sales gain in a year during February -- held down overall sales in March.  </p>
<p>The March retail sales gain was weaker than anticipated by Wall Street economists who had forecast a more robust 0.6 percent pickup in business. It may raise questions about the durability of consumer demand in the second quarter though it followed two exceptionally strong sales months.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve cited strong demand as the primary reason for its decision on March 25 to boost short-term interest rates. Most analysts predicted further rate rises later in the year until the central bank feels demand has waned enough to keep inflation in check.  </p>
<p>During March, auto-dealer sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $53.6 billion. That followed a 3.3 percent jump in February sales that was the strongest monthly gain since a 3.6 percent surge a year earlier in February 1996.</p>
<p>New cars account for about one-quarter of total retail sales, so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures. Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.9 percent increase in February.</p>
<p>Previously, Commerce said that total January retail sales had risen by 1.5 percent and that February sales were up 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>But the government revised its estimate of the February sales rise to 1.5 percent -- nearly double its original estimate -- and boosted the January increase to 1.7 percent. That made the January sales gain the strongest in nearly a year since a matching 1.7 percent increase in February 1996.  </p>
<p>Sales by general merchandise stores rose modestly by 0.3 percent to $27.5 billion in March after a 1.3 percent jump in February. At apparel stores, sales of clothing increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in February.</p>
<p>Sales of all types of durable goods, from new cars to building hardware, rose a scant 0.1 percent in March to $89.3 billion after a 3.1 percent increase in February. Sales of non-durables like food and clothing gained 0.3 percent last month to $126.3 billion after a 0.4 percent March rise.</p>
<p>Sales of building materials increased 1.6 percent to $11.9 billion in March after a 2.2 percent jump in February.</p>
<p>Gasoline service station sales were down 0.8 percent in March to $13.4 billion following a 1.1 percent fall in February. Cheaper prices for imported oil after a winter surge have been reflected in lower gasoline prices, which is reflected in the sales total.</p>
