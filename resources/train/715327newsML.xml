<p>Vice President Al Gore, taking issue with economists who say the U.S. federal budget deficit will wipe itself out, said on Wednesday that a bipartisan plan is still needed to ensure that the budget reaches balance.</p>
<p>&quot;Now is not the time to heed the calls of those who say that the budget will balance itself,&quot; Gore said in a speech to the Center for National Policy, a liberal-leaning policy group.</p>
<p>Several economists have predicted that the budget could come into balance as early as next year without tax or spending changes because of unexpectedly high revenues flowing from the strong U.S. economy.  </p>
<p>But Gore said that the tax cuts and spending proposals put forward by the Clinton administration under a bipartisan balanced-budget framework are needed to ensure that the &quot;new economy&quot; continues to prosper. &quot;The deficit will go back up again unless we confront these hard choices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gore said that the current strength of the economy stemmed from President Bill Clinton's 1993 budget package, which raised taxes, cut spending and was narrowly approved by Congress without a single Repbulican vote.</p>
<p>&quot;The success that has flowed from the plan ... is the result of the Clinton-Gore economic blueprint,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked about the current tightness of labor markets, Gore said that upward price pressure has been held in check by global markets and domestic productivity gains.</p>
<p>Trade pacts enacted by the Clinton administration have forced U.S. companies to keep their prices competitive, he said. And new, difficult-to-measure productivity gains were also emerging in a delayed response to more efficient industrial applications for microprocessors, he added.</p>
