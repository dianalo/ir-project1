<title>KUWAIT: Kuwait to back OPEC rollover if all members agree.</title>
<headline>Kuwait to back OPEC rollover if all members agree.</headline>
<dateline>KUWAIT 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kuwait's Oil Minister said his country would back a rollover of OPEC's current production ceiling if all the other 10 members backed the measure, the official Kuwait News Agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The only option would be to accept a rollover of the (current OPEC production) ceiling if all member countries agreed on that,&quot; Isa al-Mazeedi told the agency before leaving for Vienna, where the producer group is due to hold its bi-annual meeting on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Mazeedi said &quot;oil prices are low at present,&quot; and added that Kuwait wanted to pervent them from &quot;deteriorating.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Continuing with the current production ceiling depends on the report that would be submitted by (OPEC's) secretary-general during the meeting and that is to be presented by the head of the committee that follows price (developments),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Mazeedi) expressed hope that the results would be positive in the light of the informationation that would be presented,&quot; the agency said without elaboration.  </p>
<p>Mazeedi expected oil prices to improve during the third quarter of 1997 due to a possible decline in global stocks, which had reached high levels, KUNA said.</p>
<p>Kuwait, which has a production quota of two million barrels per day (bpd), has often said it would seek a larger quota when OPEC decides to increase its self-imposed output ceiling set at 25.03 million bpd.</p>
<p>Kuwait puts its production capacity at 2.5 million bpd.</p>
