<p>Following is a statement issued by the Finance Ministry following a day-long meeting of state finance ministers on Friday in New Delhi:</p>
<p>&quot;The Conference of State Finance Ministers has agreed on the imperative to reform Central Sales Tax and Stamp Duty and pursue the introduction of Value-Added Tax (VAT). The meeting which was convened in New Delhi today by the Finance Minister had extensive deliberations on the subject of taxation on inter-state sales, stamp duty and VAT. It also took note of the progress made by the various states towards introduction of VAT.</p>
<p>The Conference reached broad agreement on the major recommendations contained in the report of the Committee of State Finance Ministers on Stamp Duty Reform. The major recommmendations include the following:</p>
<p>(i) there should be moderate rates coupled with proper valuation. Initially a state could fix a rate within a band of 10-5 percent to be adopted. Later the band should be narrowed to 8-6 percent.</p>
<p>(ii) a Central Valuation Cell should be created in each State. This cell would lay down norms as well as value properties in different areas. This cell will be under the Inspector General of Registration.</p>
<p>(iii) the definition should be widened to cover transfers on power of attorney where should (sic) is a transfer of possession of property and/or an agreement to sell. Special provisions should be made for apartment transfers.</p>
<p>(iv) in the context of issue of debentures, the rate of duty on the mortgage of property with the Trust must be made uniform in all the States. A low rate with a monetary ceiling as in Maharashtra and Gujarat may be adopted.</p>
<p>(v) in the context of accelerating growth, amalgamation/mergers of companies approved by courts may not be treated on par with regular conveyance. In such cases, a concessional rate of duty may be levied. There should be no duty on amalgamation of sick companies with others under the orders of BIFR.</p>
<p>(vi) in relation to automobile finance the rate should be one percent of one year's annual average rent (AAR) plus amount of premium. As regards machinery, while the rate could be the same, there should be a monetary ceiling of 20,000 or 30,000 rupees.</p>
<p>(vii) the other recommendations of the Committee on State Finance Ministers on Stamp Duty Reform relate to Equitable Mortgage and Securitisation, central and state instruments, shift from ad valorem duty to specific duty, reduction in the number of specific duty rates, common inscription and modernisation.</p>
<p>In view of the international commitment arising out of the Male Summit that all trade barriers between SAARC countries would be eliminated by 2001, the Conference considered it necessary to evolve a transitional mechanism for the reform of taxation of inter-state sales. It was therefore considered expedient to agree to consider a phased programme of action comprising of the following elements and to convene another meeting for further discussion.</p>
<p>(i) the rate of tax applicable to inter-state sales should be brought down step-wise from four percent to three percent to two percent;</p>
<p>(ii) one half of the total revenue collected from CST should be retained by the exporting State and the other half pooled for sharing among the States on the basis of an agreed formula based on consumption;</p>
<p>(iii) to start with, rebate should be allowed at half the CST rate by the importing state for the tax paid by a registered dealer for buying (or bringing) goods from outside the state. Eventually, rebating should be extended to the full tax levied in the State of origin on inter-state sales and corresponding the entire two percent collected would be given to the pool by the exporting state;</p>
<p>(iv) inter-state sales to unregistered dealers should be subjected to tax at the local rates;</p>
<p>(v) the Centre should set up a fund to counter any possible revenue losses to the States and Union Territories in the immediate post-reform phase. The State governments will project their losses and Government of India will compensate the State government in suitable monthly instalments;</p>
<p>(vi) a State would be allowed to levy taxes on selected services only when it harmonises its rate structure;</p>
<p>(vii) with the sucessful introduction of VAT by the States, they would be allowed multipoint taxation of 'declared' goods;</p>
<p>(viii) the States would make other revenue-raising efforts as recommended in the report of the group of officials and experts on taxation of inter-state sales. Similarly, any initial revenue or cash flow problems would be redressed in terms of the mechanism recommended in the Report.</p>
<p>It was also decided that further discussion will be held on the advisability and expediency of imposing consignment tax in the light of para (iii) above.</p>
<p>The Conference took note of the positive steps taken by Andhra Pradesh, Delhi Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal towards introduction of VAT. It was also agreed to constitute a working group of finance ministers of States and Union Territories to evaluate the progress made towards and chart a time path for introduction of VAT in all the States and Union Territories.</p>
<p>This working group will be serviced by experts drawn from the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi, and any other organisation as may be considered necessary. This working group will be requested to complete its deliberations within three months so that this Report can be considered in the Conference of the States Finance Ministers and Union Territories in October, 1997.&quot;</p>
