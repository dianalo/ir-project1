<title>RUSSIA: Russian Duma to postpone 1st qtr budget review.</title>
<headline>Russian Duma to postpone 1st qtr budget review.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-17</dateline>

<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament is postponing a review of the first quarter budget and discussion of revised government spending plans until May 21 from April 23, Duma officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had asked deputies to delay the review of revised spending plans because preparatory work was not yet complete.</p>
<p>The government had suggested a debate on May 15, but deputies decided to postpone it to May 21.</p>
<p>The changes are needed because of Russia's dismal revenue performance in the first quarter, when revenues were less than 60 percent of planned levels. This means that the government must sequester spending -- cut spending across the board.</p>
<p>According to the budget law, the Duma must be given sequestration plans within 20 days of the end of the quarter, but this target never looked realistic.</p>
<p>First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais had been due to present the revised plans to the Duma on April 23.</p>
<p>Chubais said on Thursday that the 1997 budget was not realistic and he promised to cut spending and raise over $5 billion through state sell-offs and precious metals sales.</p>
