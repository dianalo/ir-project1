<p>PALM OIL FUTURES - Active technical selling appeared towards</p>
<p>the close after Sept futures broke the 1,170 and 1,168 levels.</p>
<p>PORLA's slightly friendly end-May stocks and SGS's June 1-15</p>
<p>exports failed to stir buying. Market was uncertain and</p>
<p>September next support would be at 1,150 level.</p>
<p>PALM OIL PHYSICALS - lack of buyers and weaker futures</p>
<p>dragged down cash prices in nearby CPOs.</p>
<p>Other contracts also posted double-digit losses.</p>
<p>&quot;There was little reaction to the friendly PORLA end-May stock data and prices were hardly moved in early afternoon trade,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The Palm Oil Registration and Licensing and Authority (PORLA) released the May crop data after the closure of the morning market.</p>
<p>PORLA put end-May stocks at 711,841 tonnes, compared with private crop forecaster Ivan Wong's estimate of 740,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Palm oil output in May was up 7.61 percent to 790,640 tonnes and exports were 626,606 tonnes.  </p>
<p>Traders said the June 1-15 palm oil exports by cargo surveyor had no impact as the data was within market expectations. SGS said June 1-15 palm oil exports were at 290,935 tonnes against 264,659 tonnes for May 1-15.</p>
<p>Prices opened slightly higher in line with a steady soyoil futures in Chicago last week with news of Malaysian Oil Palm Growers' Council (MPOGC) production estimate of 782,000 tonnes having little impact on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Market was uncertain and the near-term prospect looks bearish as September is heading downward, a technical analyst said. &quot;The next support for September is 1,150.&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Physicals June (south) crude palm oil saw offers at 1,217.50 ringgit against bids at 1,212.50 after trading at 1,217.50, 1,220 and 1,212.50. June (central) saw offers at 1,200 versus 1,190.</p>
