<p>German President Roman Herzog said on Tuesday he remained convinced that European economic and monetary Union will take place as scheduled in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;I remain convinced that monetary union will be brought about (on the) first of January 1999 and that quite a sizeable number of EU member countries will participate,&quot; Herzog told a news conference in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;We need (monetary union) because we have to cope with the ever-growing problems of central and eastern Europe and because this expanded and enlarged European Union will give us an incredibly large market,&quot; Herzog said.</p>
<p>Herzog declined to comment on media reports that Germany had abandoned efforts to insist on the very highest standards for entry into Europe's monetary union, saying he was not aware of the reports.</p>
<p>The German president, who arrived on a six-day official visit on Saturday, met with Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto earlier on Tuesday to discuss bilateral relations as well as the European Union.</p>
<p>Herzog said he also discussed with Hashimoto the two countries' bids to win permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not simply a matter of national prestige, but as we think, a clear illustration and documentation of the willingness of the two countries to assume their share of worldwide responsibility,&quot; Herzog said.</p>
<p>Herzog will travel to central and western Japan before leaving on Thursday.</p>
