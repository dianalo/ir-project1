<headline>Jordanian shares slip as Arab Bank falls.</headline>
<dateline>AMMAN 1997-07-14</dateline>

<p>Jordan's official stock market index fell back slightly on Monday when a three-day surge in Arab Bank shares petered out in profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>Arab Bank, which has dominated bourse trading and driven the index upwards in a generally weak market, gained 4.5 dinars to a fresh five-year high of 284.5 dinars ($401) before easing to close at 278 dinars, down two dinars.</p>
<p>It helped drag the official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index down 0.37 percent to 163.69 points after accounting for 40 percent of Monday's turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;The story of the market is Arab Bank,&quot; said broker Ibrahim Odeh of Wataniyeh Financial Services.</p>
<p>Profit-takers moved in when the share price started slipping, Odeh said, and it could ease further.</p>
<p>But he said the medium-term outlook was for more gains, with some dealers forecasting Arab Bank shares would soon rise to around 300 dinars.</p>
<p>Brokers attribute Arab Bank's recent rise -- it climbed 16 dinars in three trading sessions -- to forecasts of strong 1997 profits, expectations of a bonus share offering, and government plans to scrap foreign share ownership ceilings.</p>
<p>Investment firm National Portfolio, which has a large Arab Bank shareholding, also fell on Monday despite foreign demand, Odeh said. It dropped 0.08 dinars to 1.45 dinars.</p>
<p>Overall falling shares outnumbered gainers on Monday by 17 to nine, with another 17 shares trading but closing unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 best-performing shares in terms of turnover and financial performance fell 0.48 percent to 80.49 points, 3.48 percent down from the start of the year. $1 = 0.709 dinars</p>
