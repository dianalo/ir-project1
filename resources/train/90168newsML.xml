<title>USA: U.S. foreign crudes subdued as arbitrage narrows.</title>
<headline>U.S. foreign crudes subdued as arbitrage narrows.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. foreign crude sellers attempted to offer expensive North Sea Brent into the U.S. Gulf, but potential buyers remained lukewarm, traders said.</p>
<p>A narrowing in the West Texas Intermediate/Brent arbitrage for November choked off sales possibilities.</p>
<p>The spread eased to 95 cents a barrel from around $1.10 a barrel, raising delivered costs for Brent crude.</p>
<p>&quot;One seller showed a 15-cent premium (to WTI), but he backed off,&quot; an East Coast trader said, noting that sellers should be executing trades at 25 cents premium to break-even.</p>
<p>Offers for early Nov Brent were at 10 cents yesterday.  </p>
<p>European refinery demand for distillate-rich crudes such as Oseberg also thinned availability to the U.S.</p>
<p>A handful of sweet crudes like Cusiana was seen, after a trader reportedly sold one cargo for mid-Oct Tuesday at a confidential price, believed near Nov WTI even fob.</p>
<p>Several Cusiana cargoes are still available for November, but were deemed expensive against light domestic alternatives.</p>
<p>Other available grades in the region included Ecopetrol's South Blend and Vasconia grades for November, and Oriente for second-half October. But traders said the U.S. government's upcoming sale of sour crude disuaded buyers from paying up.</p>
<p>&quot;Once those barrels hit the market, we could see another 50 cents shaved off sour crude,&quot; a Midwest trader said.</p>
<p>In the U.S. after market, November Brent traded twice outright at $23.15 and $23.20 a barrel, at 100 lots apiece, firmer than London's IPE close at $23.11 a barrel.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth Nov/Dec pulled back to trade at 46 cents, down from the London session at 50/53 cents.</p>
