<p>Parliamentary leaders from Russia and Belarus appealed on Wednesday for compromise and wisdom from both sides in the political conflict in Belarus to avert &quot;division, tragedy and trouble&quot;.</p>
<p>The parliamentary chiefs met in the Russian city of Smolensk to discuss a standoff between the Belarus parliament and President Alexander Lukashenko over his planned referendum on Sunday on increasing his powers.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge both sides, the parliament and the president, to sit down together at the negotiating table and seek a form of compromise,&quot; Yegor Stroyev, chairman of Russia's upper house of parliament, told reporters after 90 minutes of talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We reached a unanimous opinion that any further deepening of the conflict between the two branches of power in Belarus would bring the Belarussian people nothing but division, tragedy and trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Belarus parliament chairman Semyon Sharetsky attended the meeting in Smolesnk's regional parliament building with Stroyev and Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of Russia's lower chamber.</p>
<p>The two Russians came to Smolensk, halfway between Moscow and the Belarussian capital Minsk, to mediate. The two former Soviet republics are close allies.</p>
<p>But hopes of a breakthrough dimmed when Lukashenko, who is demanding changes in the constitution, refused to attend. An aide told Reuters in Minsk the president had wanted Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to be at the meeting.</p>
<p>Stroyev, who said he was speaking on behalf of all the delegates in Smolensk, indicated that the Belarus parliament would be ready to compromise on some of the constitutional changes Lukashenko wants, if the president also compromised.</p>
<p>&quot;The constitution is not an ikon. It really must be changed and can be changed and needs to changed, especially when a young state has only just been created,&quot; Stroyev said.</p>
<p>&quot;We even expressed a wish, reaching out to President Lukashenko, that it would not be a bad thing if this constitution were to set down that parliament be formed of two chambers,&quot; he said, referring to one of Lukashenko's proposals.</p>
<p>He gave no other details of how the sides might compromise.</p>
<p>Sheretsky said little to reporters but praised Russia's efforts to mediate in the crisis in which parliament has initiated procedures to impeach Lukashenko.</p>
<p>&quot;Where do people go when things are bad, when things are hard? They go to those closest to them, to their brothers. So that is what we are doing today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he planned more talks Lukashenko on his return to Minsk, he said: We are always talking to the president.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has signed an agreement on closer integration with Belarus and says stability is vital to the integration process. President Boris Yeltsin, who spoke to Lukashenko and Sheretsky by telephone on Wednesday, has also called for compromise.</p>
<p>&quot;Further confrontation will complicate the situation in Belarus and have a serious effect on the union relations between Belarus and Russia,&quot; Stroyev said.</p>
