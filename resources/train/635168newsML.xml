<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair should press Britain's European Union partners at this month's Amsterdam summit to delay the planned single currency, former prime minister John Major said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Major told the Daily Telegraph that the victory of left-wing parties in Sunday's French elections and a row over Germany's plans to revalue its gold reserves to meet the criteria for the single currency meant the case for delay was stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Major, who came close in the interview to abandoning his &quot;negotiate and decide&quot; stance twoard economic and monetary union (EMU), said the EU was preparing a dangerous fudge of the criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be folly. It would mean the establishment of a weak European currency that would be likely to be at the mercy of the markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not stand idly by and permit a fudge to proceed. I believe the government should raise this matter with our European partners at the Amsterdam summit. The government should use its voice and vote to prevent a fudge,&quot; Major added.</p>
<p>His comments broadly echoed comments on Monday by former chancellor of the exchequer Kenneth Clarke, who said a delay to EMU was now both inevitable and desirable.</p>
<p>Clarke, one of six candidates to succeed Major as Conservative leader, sought to strengthen his appeal among the party's Euro-sceptic members of parliament by calling on Blair to hold the line on the convergence criteria and advocate delay.</p>
<p>&quot;It is increasingly clear that EMU cannot proceed on a safe and sustainable basis in January 1999. In the face of public resistance to the speed of the necessary adjustments and reform, the incentive to fudge the convergence criteria is just too high,&quot; the former finance minister said.</p>
<p>He said that by electing the Socialists the French people were trying to avoid the painful choices that free markets and international competition demanded of them.</p>
<p>&quot;They have taken fright at the economic realities of the modern world, returning to the failed Socialist ideas of yesterday,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
