<title>USA: CBOT corn closes higher on dry weather concerns.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn closes higher on dry weather concerns.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on concerns about dry weather in portions of the U.S. Midwest and in the North China Plain, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still dealing with weather that doesn't have a lot of water in it,&quot; said Dave Armstrong, analyst for ABN Amro, The Chicago Corp.</p>
<p>Southern and central portions of Indiana and Illinois much of Missouri and Nebraska and southern Iowa were needing rain, they said.</p>
<p>Much of the U.S. Midwest should stay fair and dry through Friday, with the next chance for rain seen on Saturday and Sunday, according to a forecast by Jon Davis, Smith Barney meteorologist.</p>
<p>But corn futures closed below the day's highs as nearby soybeans fell and wheat dropped plus there were signs the corn market was nearing short term overbought signals.</p>
<p>The nine-day relative strength index (RSI) for the September closed at nearly 70 percent. An RSI of 70 percent is considered an overbought market.</p>
<p>Corn closed 1/2 to 4-1/4 cents per bushel higher, with September up 4-1/4 at $2.62-1/4 a bushel. December closed 3-1/4 cents higher at $2.63-1/2.  </p>
<p>Talk that a private meteorologist had put more rain in a weather forecast was greeted with some skepticism. But hedge selling limited the advances in corn futures.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're buying some from the farmer and that's probably why we didn't get the big gains today,&quot; Armstrong said.</p>
<p>Farmers Commodities Corp sold six million bushels of December and Tenco Inc sold four million bushels of December, traders said.</p>
<p>Cargill Investor Services bought 15.0 million bushels of December, ABN Amro, The Chicago Corp bought five million December, and Refco Inc bought four million December and sold six million bushels of December, traders said.</p>
<p>In spread trading, Cargill Inc did six million bushels of December/July at 15-1/2 cents premium July and Continental Grain spread five million July/Decmeber at 15-1/2 cents premium July, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 95,000 contracts, below the 97,084 traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>In corn options, Prudential Securities bought 500 September $2.40 puts at two cents and 500 September $2.50 puts at four cents, and sold 400 September $2.40 puts at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 cents, traders said. Refco Inc bought 700 December $2.70 calls at 12-1/2 to 14 cents, they said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 27,000 contracts, below the 35,240 traded Tuesday.</p>
