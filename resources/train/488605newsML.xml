<p>Australian shares ended a touch firmer for a second day running, led by a surging Coca-Cola Amatil in the wake of its A$3.4 billion (US$2.7 billin) Philippines soft drinks deal.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries index ended 8.5 points firmer at 2,369.5 in moderate trade, despite a fall on Wall Street, and followed a 5.8 point rise on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was aided by early short-covering in major stocks and some bargain hunting after the sharp fall in line with Wall Street following the Easter break.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a bad performance and shows a bit of resilience, which we haven't seen for a while,&quot; said Austock Brokers research director David Perry.</p>
<p>C-C Amatil rose A$1.40 on the day to close at A$14.20, an 18.8 percent gain since it announced plans on Thursday to acquire San Miguel Corp soft drink subsidiary Coca Cola Bottler Philippines Inc in exchange for equity.</p>
<p>The strong gain surprised some brokers following suggestions by analysts that the price paid was expensive, and that the Philippines plants could require high levels of capital expenditure.</p>
<p>However, others said the jump had to be seen in the context of C-C Amatil's sharp fall from around A$18 late last year on earnings disappointments.</p>
<p>&quot;A very good stock was really needing a bit of a blood transfusion and the market perceives that it's got that with this deal,&quot; said Intersuisse head of equities Andrew Sekely.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, The Broken Hill Pty Co rose five cents to A$16.99 on good volume, while takeover target The Bank of Melbourne eased three cents to A$9.47.</p>
<p>Brokers said the fall followed comments by Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and regulatory authorities which were seen as negative for the A$1.44 billion bid by Westpac Banking Corp.</p>
