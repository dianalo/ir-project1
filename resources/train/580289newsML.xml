<p>The leader of Turkey's main opposition party said on Tuesday he was in full agreement with dissident government deputy Yalim Erez on forming a coalition excluding the ruling Islamists.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in full agreement with Erez. We will press the button this week,&quot; Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz told reporters after talks with conservative Erez in reference to plans to topple the government.  </p>
<p>Erez was to hold further talks with a leftist leader later on Tuesday on forming an alternative coalition that would keep out the Islamist Welfare Party of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>Erez told reporters after meeting Yilmaz that he planned to discuss his coalition proposal as soon as possible with the leader of his True Path Party (DYP), Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no obstacle in the way of forming an alternative government,&quot; said former trade and industry minister Yalim Erez, who resigned last month in protest at the Islamists' failure to back an army-led crackdown on religious activism.</p>
<p>Another dissident DYP deputy warned on Monday of action to bring down the 10-month-old coalition if the party did not support the alternative coalition proposal.</p>
