<p>Slovenian President Milan Kucan on Monday gave acting Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek the task of forming a new government but the centre-left leader acknowledged he had an uphill struggle ahead to remain premier.</p>
<p>Kucan, hugely popular for his role in Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, urged all party leaders to try to break the political deadlock that arose from inconclusive general elections on November 10.</p>
<p>&quot;I name Janez Drnovsek as candidate for prime minister... He is the leader of the party that won most votes in the election,&quot; the president told a news conference.</p>
<p>Drnovsek's centre-left Liberal Democrats emerged as the strongest party in Slovenia's second general election since independence, winning 25 of 90 parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>But Drnovsek is pitted against an alliance of three rightwing parties -- the conservative People's Party, the centre-right Social Democrats and Christian Democrats -- who together won 45 seats, one seat short of an absolute majority.</p>
<p>Drnovsek, 46, needs to win over at least one of the rightwing parties to break the stalemate, even if he gains backing from smaller parties, such as the United List of Social Democrats, the former communists.</p>
<p>Drnovsek, speaking after Kucan's announcement, acknowledged that forming the next government was not going to be easy.</p>
<p>&quot;I have accepted the candidacy. The possibilities of gaining an absolute majority are realistic, although the vote in parliament is uncertain,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Kucan said he would lodge Drnovsek's nomination with parliament on Friday. Deputies then have seven days to vote on whether to back or reject Drnovsek's candidacy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the talks to come, I will try to increase my support ...The task is relatively hard. I hope the interests of the state will prevail over party interests,&quot; Drnovsek said.</p>
<p>Kucan said nearly two months of talks with political leaders showed the rightwing and centre-left blocs were becoming entrenched, with neither willing to back the other.</p>
<p>&quot;I am surprised by the firm stand being taken by the political parties, which is getting even firmer,&quot; Kucan said.</p>
<p>Failure to break either side's resolve could lead to a minority government or ultimately fresh elections.</p>
<p>Drnovsek said he would talk to all parliamentary parties but the so-called &quot;Spring&quot; alliance of rightwing parties reiterated that he could not count on its support.</p>
<p>&quot;Drnovsek will not get enough support (in parliament) as he cannot produce one extra vote (necessary for an absolute majority),&quot; Ivo Hvalica, head of the parliamentary group of Social Democrats told Slovenian radio.</p>
<p>People's Party leader Marjan Podobnik, 36, who effectively heads the rightwing alliance, vowed after the election that he would become prime minister.</p>
<p>Speaking after Kucan's announcement, Podobnik told Slovenian radio: &quot;This decision does not surprise me. I told the president we do not mind if the Liberal Democrat leader gets the first chance.&quot;</p>
