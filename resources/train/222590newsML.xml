<p>Lithuanian newspapers carried the following reports in their Thursday editions. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy:</p>
<p>LIETUVOS RYTAS</p>
<p>- Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas named the chairman of the Homeland Union board Gediminas Vagnorius for the post of prime minister.</p>
<p>- The government issued guarantees for 68 million litas loan to Lietuvos Energija to buy heating oil and pay for natural gas. Lithuanian Savings Bank will grant a credit of 40 million litas and Vilnius Bank another 28 million litas.</p>

<p>RESPUBLIKA</p>
<p>- Approximately 50 percent of Vilnius inhabitants support the idea that Lithuania should join NATO.</p>
<p>- 'I think that the litas and dollar exchange rate will not change in the near future. There will be no abrupt changes during the next 12 months but, of course, that does not mean that this exchange rate will remain forever' said prime minister-designate Gediminas Vagnorius in an interview.</p>
<p>- Outgoing energy minister Saulius Kutas says in an interview that the most important task for the state was to have an alternative source of fuel and 'we are very late'.</p>
<p>LIETUVOS AIDAS</p>
<p>- Vagnorius promised neither cheaper sausage nor vodka, but the possibility to work and earn. He said that he would introduce the new cabinet to Brazauskas on Friday or at the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>- The Lithuanian parliament's Chechen independence support committee and the Kaunas municipality launched a support action for Chechen people, hit by war.</p>
