<p>Following are analysts' initial reactions to Japan's current account surplus for December, which the Finance Ministry said on Monday shrank 23.1 percent to 820.7 billion yen from a year earlier.</p>
<p>YOSHITO SAKAKIBARA, ECONOMIC ANALYST, SALOMON BROTHERS ASIA:</p>
<p>&quot;I think the numbers are more or less in line with market expectations, so they are probably not a major input for the market.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The decline in the trade balance widened in November.... That seems to suggest that...the yen's decline pushed up import prices, therefore the decline of the trade surplus widened. That has been happening over the last couple of months and that's probably going to hold the trade surplus down for a little while longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to a jump in crude oil prices, Sakakibara added:</p>
<p>&quot;If crude oil prices stay there or even rise slightly higher, that's going to be another factor pushing import prices higher.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that, as we saw in a similar situation back in early November, the level of about 125 yen (to the dollar) is going to be some sort of psychological resistance level,&quot; Sakakibara said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the currency level of the yen is going to stay somewhere around there, then eventually price factors, that is high import prices, will wane. And I think that, as today's numbers show, exports have been recovering, so there's going to be a rebound of the trade surplus eventually. When the yen's decline stops, what we will likely see is a rebound of the Japanese trade surplus.&quot;  </p>
<p>TOMOKO FUJII, ECONOMIST AT SALOMON BROTHERS ASIA LIMITED &quot;The figure is very close to what we had predicted, as has been previously shown in the customs-cleared trade data. The surplus is still on a declining trend, but it may start rising again from around the middle of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>HIROSHI SUZUKI, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE</p>
<p>&quot;Exports are growing while the growth in imports has become sluggish. The growth in exports is mainly from the weaker yen and steady U.S. economy, which has especially helped car exports. Growth in imports would have been smaller had it not been for the rise in global oil prices.&quot;</p>
