<title>USA: State Street stock up on takeover rumors.</title>
<headline>State Street stock up on takeover rumors.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>State Street Boston Corp. stock surged on takeover speculation Friday, a day after Bank of New York Co. Inc. said it had amassed a 5 percent stake and wanted approval to buy up to 9.9 percent of the banking company.</p>
<p>State Street Boston shares rose $8.125 to $71 on the New York Stock Exchange where it was one of the biggest gainers of the session.</p>
<p>Bank of New York said late on Thursday that as of Sept. 30, it held 4.99 percent of State Street Boston Corp. and wanted to boost its stake for investment purposes.</p>
<p>Analysts and stock traders said the announcement looked like the beginning of a courtship that could eventually lead to a full-scale takeover.</p>
<p>But one analyst was sceptical that there would be a takeover.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it would be expensive for most of the likely buyers,&quot; said Ronald Mandle, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. He noted the ratio of State Street's share price to its earnings is in the upper teens, which is high for a bank stock.</p>
<p>Mandle also noted that the management of State Street Boston wanted to remain independent.</p>
<p>State Street said on Thursday that its board of directors believes the company's strategic goals can be best achieved if the company remains independent.</p>
<p>Mandle, who recommended holding the stock, said State Street Boston has a good long-term track record and the management has done a good job.</p>
<p>Bank of New York stock rose 75 cents to $34 on the NYSE.</p>
