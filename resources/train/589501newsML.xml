<p>The U.K. spot natural gas market saw trade centred on the coming weekend and on the year starting this October as prices settled down after a hectic day on Thursday, traders and brokers said.</p>
<p>Prices returned to close to their Wednesday levels by Friday evening, following the volatility of Thursday. But trade was much quieter, with little activity seen in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;It picked up, then sunk down a little, then nothing,&quot; said a trader. &quot;By 15.30 (local) there were no bids at all, and only desultory offers.&quot;</p>
<p>The gas year opened at around 13.50 pence a therm, then traded up as high as 13.75 pence, and then stalled with offers at around 13.80 pence a therm.</p>
<p>A trader said that as offers reached the 13.80 pence level, bids started to fall back but offers did not follow. Bids were eventually withdrawn altogether and no further trade was concluded.</p>
<p>The market was overshadowed by the volatility that had characterised trade on Thursday, when the gas year lost a penny a therm - over 7 percent of its value at the time - in a few hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Days like yesterday reinforce the impression that the market is far from mature,&quot; said a dealer. He added that there are still far too few people involved and the market needs more players and more trading.</p>
<p>The other period to see active trade was the weekend, with several deals done for Saturday alone, or Saturday and Sunday, or the weekend and Monday.</p>
<p>Prices were little changed, and showed little sign of influence from the recent market movements further out.</p>
<p>The first quarter 1998 traded at 17.10 pence, a bounce back from the level of 16.30 pence seen on Thursday and approaching the levels seen immediately before the market shifted. There was also some trade seen in the second quarter and the summer.</p>
<p>The IPE natural gas futures contract suffered from the withdrawal of bids on the physical market in the afternoon, and no deals were done.</p>
<p>By the close of the contract, there were no bids or offers posted in any period. The IPE settled at higher prices for all periods with the exception of September, which fell by 0.23 pence a therm.</p>
<p>The rises reflected sentiment on the physical market at the time the contract closed, and the months in Q1 settled at 17.67, 17.70 and 14.87 pence a therm respectively -- an average of 16.75 pence a therm, below the 17.10 traded on the OTC market.</p>
