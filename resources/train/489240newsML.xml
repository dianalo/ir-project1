<p>U.S. State Department officials said on Saturday some of Colombia's top drug lords and their relatives had been stripped of their U.S. entry visas.</p>
<p>The State Department issued a list of more than 250 Colombians -- most of them with proven or suspected links to the infamous Cali drug cartel -- now officially declared persona non grata in the United States.</p>
<p>The document features billionaire Cali mob capos Gilberto and Rodriguez Orejuela, even though both are serving time for drug trafficking and illicit enrichment in Bogota's maximum, high-security La Picota jail. Even when freed, they would be unlikely to head to the United States, which has made a string of unsuccessful requests for their extradition to face trail in a U.S court.</p>
<p>Another senior cartel member, Helmer &quot;Pacho&quot; Herrera, also behind bars in Colombia, made the list alongside the late drug lord Jose &quot;Chepe&quot; Santacruz Londono, who was shot dead by police in March 1996, after escaping from prison.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States Department of State has revoked any and all visas which may be held by Colombian specially designated narcotraffickers ... The revocation of visas is effective immediately,&quot; a statement from the United States Embassy in Bogota said.</p>
<p>The list of &quot;non-desirables&quot; includes Miguel Rodriguez's wife, his son William and scores of businesspeople suspected of running shell companies used to launder Cali cartel funds.</p>
<p>But the document does not include individuals such as Justo Pastor Perafan, said to be Colombia's No.1 drug kingpin still on the run, nor the heads of the fast-expanding Norte del Valle drug cartel.</p>
