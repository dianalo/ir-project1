<p>Japan should not raise interest rates this year, as such a move could harm Japan's economy and financial institutions, a key Lower House member from the opposition New Frontier Party (Shinshinto) told Reuters Financial Television on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;An interest rate hike now would put a further brake on the economy. It would also be a considerable blow to financial institutions suffering from bad debts,&quot; said Yoshio Suzuki, who is also a former executive director of the Bank of Japan (BOJ).  </p>
<p>&quot;I understand that some people wish to see a rise in interest rates, but Japan is not on a firm recovery trend. A rate hike would result in the economy quickly losing speed,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates could also aggravate Japan's financial crisis, Suzuki said.</p>
<p>&quot;Under such circumstances, a hike in interest rates is unthinkable,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Suzuki also said Japanese financial institutions' bad loan writeoffs were far from over.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures for bad loans compiled by the Ministry of Finance may be showing a decline, but land prices are continuing to fall,&quot; Suzuki said.</p>
<p>&quot;A decline in the value of collateral means that loans that are recoverable now may eventually turn into unrecoverable loans. So it is doubtful whether bad loans are actually decreasing,&quot; he added.</p>
