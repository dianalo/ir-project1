<p>Italy's powerful and secretive merchant bank Mediobanca held the first news conference in its history on Friday but journalists got only a few paces beyond the front door.</p>
<p>Reporters were ushered into a cramped assembly room next to the bank's entrance with tiered desks, resembling a lecture hall, for a presentation on Austria's privatisation programme.</p>
<p>The door to the room was firmly shut as soon as the presentation got under way and a heavily built official of the bank stood conspicuously next to the exit.</p>
<p>Mediobanca's chairman Francesco Cingano chaired the meeting but Enrico Cuccia, the media-shy old man who has held sway over the bank's fortunes for half a century, was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Cuccia, now approaching 90, carved out a pivotal role in Italian capitalism by spinning a web of alliances between business families in return for key shareholdings in blue chip companies such as car maker Fiat and tyre group Pirelli.</p>
<p>Widely seen as Italy's most elitist business institution, Mediobanca has traditionally disdained the media, which are allowed to attend only the bank's annual shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Now honorary chairman, Cuccia has never been known to grant an on-the-record interview to a journalist.</p>
<p>The bank does not have a media relations office and only occasionally issues very brief press statements.</p>
<p>By inviting officials from Austria -- northeast Italy's colonial master until the mid-nineteenth century -- to give an account of their swift progress in selling state assets Mediobanca appeared to send a veiled message to Italy's leaders.</p>
<p>Italy's privatisation programme has lagged behind those of many other European countries as the government has struggled to overcome opposition to selling key assets, including state telecommunications group Stet.</p>
<p>Italian journalists have speculated that the decision to allow the press inside Mediobanca may signal a change of style after the bank, increasingly perceived as stuffy and out-of-touch, suffered a series of spectacular reverses.</p>
<p>Mediobanca brokered a merger between textiles and fashion group Marzotto and HPI, a holding company created by spinning off the industrial interests of a company called Gemina, only to see its efforts come to nought when the deal collapsed in May.</p>
<p>The bank also suffered a huge embarrassment in 1995 when the &quot;SuperGemina&quot; deal to bundle the interests of financial holding company Gemina with the former Ferruzzi agri-chemicals empire was abandoned after huge losses at a Gemina unit came to light.</p>
<p>Italian newspaper commentators mused after the demise of the Marzotto deal that Mediobanca's power as a corporate dealmaker was on the wane.</p>
