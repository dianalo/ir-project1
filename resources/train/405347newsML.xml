<p>Hainan Sundiro Motorcycle Co Ltd, one of China's top five motorbike makers, plans to make an initial public offering of 100-150 million B shares in April, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The precise size of the issue, which will be listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, has yet to be determined by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the spokesman told the Hong Kong-based newsletter, China Securities Bulletin.</p>
<p>Sundiro is among 33 enterprises recently selected as candidates for B share issues.</p>
<p>Sundiro will appoint the China Construction Bank Trust and Investment Co, which has been renamed China Xinda Trust and Investment Co, as the chief underwriter, and Hoare Govett (H.K.) Ltd as the global coordinator, the official said.</p>
<p>He said Sundiro would use money raised from the issue to upgrade production technology and facilities in Hainan and Shanghai, and for a motorbike engines joint venture with Japanese firm Kawasaki.</p>
<p>The official said Sundiro produced more than 350,000 motorbikes in 1996, up from 200,000 in 1995.  </p>
<p>The company would report much stronger profits for 1996, he said, adding the firm would release detailed 1996 results in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Sundiro reported net earnings of 65.96 million yuan for the first half of 1996, compared with 33.04 million yuan in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>The company's 1995 net profits was 70.57 million yuan, up 26.40 percent from 55.83 million yuan in 1994.</p>
<p>At the end of June 1996, the firm had 169.60 million outstanding shares, consisting of 101.83 million legal person shares and 67.77 million A shares.</p>
