<headline>FOCUS-Euro stocks lifted by Wall St rally, dollar.</headline>

<p>European stocks made healthy gains in early trading on Tuesday, buoyed up by an overnight rally on Wall Street and a stronger dollar which boosted export prospects.</p>
<p>The dollar, still in a bullish mood after encouraging comments from the recent G7 industrialised countries meeting, moved ahead against the mark and yen, though some dealers were wary ahead of U.S. economic data due later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In London, shares on the blue-chip FTSE index pushed through the 4,400-point resistance level to their highest in six weeks, taking their lead from New York which on Monday ended a three-session losing streak.</p>
<p>Wall Street investors overcame a sell-off in Boeing shares after disappointng earnings to push the Dow Jones industrial average up 44.15 to a 6,783.02 close, and give European stocks a lift at the start.</p>
<p>London dealers, facing a general election this week, said the market should take heart from polls showing the opposition Labour party maintaining its lead, making a &quot;hung&quot; parliament -- and political uncertainty -- less likely.</p>
<p>&quot;At last everyone has realised that the idea that we were swinging towards a hung parliament was nonsense,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;And with Wall Street pushing higher that is enough to move us up a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>But worries about higher interest rates to check inflationary pressures were renewed by a UK report which showed consumer confidence at its highest since the late 1980's, even before the release of billions of pounds from a current wave of building society demutualisations.</p>
<p>&quot;There are fears growing that we could be about to have a bit of a spending boom,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Banks once again led the advance, with shares squeezed higher as investment funds flooded into the sector to increase weighting in anticipation of the entry into the FTSE 100 of Halifax and other former building societies.</p>
<p>The best performer in early transactions was Frankfurt where stocks climbed 0.75 percent after a negative showing on Monday. The market was supported by the dollar and the overnight Wall Street advance.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the relatively friendly influence from Wall Street, the German market is rather sluggish,&quot; SuedwestLB said in its morning market commentary as the DAX index climbed 20.55 points to 3383.61.</p>
<p>But some said the DAX could break the psychologically important 3,400 level during the week and keep up the advance led by dollar-sensitive shares, particularly carmakers, if volumes were to return to the market.</p>
<p>In Paris, stocks climbed by 0.55 percent , supported by gains in the bonds and the stronger dollar, which would help exporting sectors.</p>
<p>But business remained quiet as investors, particularly foreign funds, stayed on the sidelines, awaiting results of the British and the French parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar was stronger against the mark and yen in Europe morning trade, although fluctuations were small as the market sought fresh incentive after the supportive comments from the G7 finance ministers at the weekend.</p>
<p>Dollar sentiment was positive but overnight Asian trade had been quiet because of a holiday in Tokyo and market operators were looking to U.S. economic data due later in the day for direction.</p>
<p>While the dollar was clearly attractive in terms of fundamentals, some dealers were uneasy about driving it up rapidly since the G7 meeting had warned against excessive volatility in currencies, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bias for the dollar is still clearly higher, but the G7 has played its role here,&quot; said Klaus Baader, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall environment is really unchanged in that the markets are beginning to get the feeling that policy-makers don't want the dollar to go much higher, and yet at the same time there are underlying attractions to the dollar,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After trading in a very tight range against both the mark and yen overnight, the dollar was at 1.7324 marks and 126.80 yen, up from 1.7274 and 126.61 in late European trade on Monday.</p>
<p>Trading was expected to be subdued until the afternoon release of a series of U.S. economic data, which was due to continue throughout the week.</p>
<p>The focus for Tuesday was to be the employment cost index (1230 GMT) for the first quarter of 1997, since wage pressures were seen as a key ingredient in the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 0915 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 was up 8.3 points at 4,398.0.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index was up 14.04 points at 2,564.29.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was up 20.55 at 3,383.61.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0915 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.7324 against the mark versus 1.7274 in late European trade on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 126.80 from 126.61.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was at  $341.75 an ounce in early trade after ending at $342.45 in London on Friday. Silver unchanged at was at $4.73.</p>
