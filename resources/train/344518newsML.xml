<p>Thousands of people lined up for a last glimpse of Mahatma Gandhi's ashes in this Hindu holy town on Thursday after his relatives retrieved the remains from a nondescript bank vault recently.</p>
<p>A plain wooden box containing the ashes of the independence leader reached Allahabad late on Wednesday night after a train journey through four states.</p>
<p>About 5,000 people crowded the railway station in this northern Indian town as the train carrying the ashes arrived. Police had to beat a path through the throng to let Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar carry the red box out of the simple second-class carriage decked out in marigold flowers.</p>
<p>The ashes were scheduled to be immersed at the Sangam confluence of the rivers Yamuna, Ganges and the mythical Saraswati later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Musicians and preachers of different faiths, including Hindus, Moslems, Sikhs and Christians surrounded the urn, singing hymns once sung by Gandhi himself to promote religious tolerance among India's varied cultures.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very, very happy to be able to fulfill my duty as a great-grandson. Since I am able to do this today, I have forgotten about all the hurdles that I had to face in retrieving my great-grandfather's ashes. All's well that ends well,&quot; the 38-year-old Tushar Gandhi told Reuters</p>
<p>Some authorities have called the claims that the ashes are Gandhi's a hoax, but many believe otherwise, and the saga of the urn containing the ashes appeared close to ending months after it began in the State Bank of India in southeastern India.</p>
<p>The wooden box on which India's eyes are riveted in the 50th year of independence from British rule was taken out on Tuesday to singing and ceremonial chants from the bank vault in the town of Cuttack by Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar Arun Gandhi.</p>
<p>After a fast -- Gandhi's favourite mode of protest -- and much media attention, the great-grandson won control in November of the box, which had lain in the vault since 1950.</p>
<p>Tushar Gandhi, a bearded graphic artist who has been charged with using the ashes to further his political ambitions, was indignant about the controversy.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't I have the right to perform the last rites of my great-grandfather? I was not carrying any scoundrel's ashes. I'm carrying the ashes of a man who is known as the father of the nation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked about suggestions that the ashes ought to have been subjected to a DNA test to determine if they were indeed Mahatma Gandhi's, Tushar Gandhi said:</p>
<p>&quot;That would have been the greatest insult to the Mahatma; if I was selling it (the ashes) to a millionaire or putting it up for display for posterity then somebody could have asked me to do so,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The day chosen for the immersion of the ashes was significant. January 30 is the 49th anniversary of the assassination of Gandhi by a Hindu fanatic.</p>
<p>The Mahatma, or great soul, as the leader was called, died only five months after India won independence from Britain.</p>
