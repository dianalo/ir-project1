<title>RUSSIA: Chechen currency new salvo to Moscow.</title>
<headline>Chechen currency new salvo to Moscow.</headline>

<dateline>GROZNY, Chechnya</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chechnya's central bank, the only renovated building in the war-ravaged capital Grozny, holds both the world's newest currency and the Russian region's dream of independence.</p>
<p>Other central banks, with armies of economists and an array of sophisticated analytical tools, wage battles against enemies like inflation.</p>
<p>But the National Bank of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, also called Qoman Bank, sees a different kind of opponent as it gears up to fire rebel Chechnya's newest salvo, the nakhar currency, against Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;A national currency is one of the attributes of an independent state,&quot; said bank Chairman Nazhmudin Uvaisayev.</p>
<p>&quot;I want our nakhar to be a hard currency, respected by all. It will be tied to currencies like the dollar and the German mark and pegged to the dollar at a rate of one to one.&quot;</p>
<p>Chechnya was a byword for multi-million dollar financial irregularities before Moscow sent in troops in December 1994 to crush its independence drive.</p>
<p>The bank exhausted its gold and hard currency reserves while fighting Russian forces, who withdrew in humiliation in August 1996 after 21 months of battles that left the region's economy wasted and tens of thousands dead.</p>
<p>Now, with stacks of nakhars printed at a secret press in Britain sitting in its vaults, the bank is preparing to launch the nakhar in a bid to make Chechnya an independent state in which the Russian ruble is a foreign currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll issue as much as we need to ensure Chechnya functions,&quot; said deputy bank chairman Yusup Imayev. &quot;How Moscow reacts is Moscow's problem -- it shouldn't interfere in our internal affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>In this heavily-guarded pale yellow edifice, the windows of which survey a war zone of bombed-out apartments and ruined government buildings, there are no debates on the issues occupying the developed world's national financial institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by 'monetary policy'?&quot; Uvaisayev replied when asked how the bank would support the nakhar.</p>
<p>Staffed not by economists but Kalashnikov-toting guards, the Chechen central bank, wholly independent of the Russian central bank since 1992, is relying mostly on pride.</p>
<p>&quot;Our monetary policy is that the Chechen people are hard-working,&quot; Imayev said. &quot;He who does not have his own currency is not an independent state.&quot;</p>
<p>But Chechnya's and the bank's economic tasks are hard core -- to rebuild roads and factories, reconstruct housing and restart economic life from the rubble of what Grozny says is $150 billion in material damage, most of it to its oil industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We must first rebuild the economy, get budget resources and sort out international connections before issuing the currency,&quot; Uvaisayev said, adding that the nakhar could be put into circulation this year or next.</p>
<p>Moscow has promised to spend an initial $1 billion to rebuild predominantly-Moslem Chechnya, which has yet to realise the late rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's dream of oil riches. But Chechnya has never had much financial credibility in Moscow's eyes and the promises have not been kept.</p>
<p>A plan in the early 1990s, in which Chechens used fake government letters of credit to withdraw billions of rubles from the Russian central bank, angered Moscow so much that it stopped sending cash to Grozny in 1994 and cut off many trade routes, strangling the region.</p>
<p>The Grozny branches of Russian commercial banks were robbed frequently during the war.</p>
<p>Last year, Moscow accused Chechens of stealing the best part of $25 million in finance ministry bonds.</p>
<p>Uvaisayev said that 600 Chechen firms had opened accounts, licenses would be issued to commercial banks and the central bank would create a two-tier banking system.</p>
<p>But Chechnya's economy -- in which nearly 90 percent are estimated to be unemployed and the illicit arms, drug and home-grown oil refining trades are flourishing -- begs the question of what some of those firms are up to.</p>
<p>Uvaisayev said the financial scandals were more fiction than fact and part of Moscow's campaign to discredit Grozny.</p>
<p>But petty traders were wary of the nakhar. &quot;Our businessmen go everywhere and they will have to pay with something. We'll have big problems,&quot; said Ibragim, a fruit seller.</p>
<p>The Chechyn central bank printed denominations of the old Soviet era -- starting with one-, three- and five-nakhar notes, going all the way up to a 1,000 nakhar depicting folk hero Sheikhh Mansur galloping on horseback.</p>
<p>&quot;We have 1 million people -- we'll figure out how much we need to issue,&quot; Uvusaiyev said, adding that every one million nakhar should be backed by $1.2 million in reserves.</p>
