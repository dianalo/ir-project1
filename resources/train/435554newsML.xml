<p>The prime ministers of Hungary and Romania heralded a new era of cooperation as both countries put years of strained relations behind them and focused their attention on NATO and European Union (EU) membership.</p>
<p>Romanian premier Victor Ciorbea, whose centre-right coalition took over from leftists in November, arrived in Budapest on Wednesday for his first official visit abroad. He is also the first Romanian premier to visit Hungary since communism collapsed in 1989.</p>
<p>His Hungarian counterpart Gyula Horn described the visit as beiong of &quot;extraordinary importance&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Romania's new government... heralds a new chapter in relations between the two countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>High on the list for discussions, diplomats and officials said, are linkage of the Hungarian and Romanian bids to join NATO and Hungarian investment in Romania's struggling economy.</p>
<p>In his new government Ciorbea gave two portfolios -- tourism and ethnic minorities -- to members of the Hungarian Democratic Union, representing Romania's large ethnic Hungarian community.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not by chance that I chose Hungary for my first visit abroad,&quot; said Ciorbea, speaking in an ornate hall of Hungary's parliament building, towering over the Danube River.</p>
<p>The two signed accords on the creation of an inter-government commission to oversee cooperation in economy, transport and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Relations between the two neighbours were significantly boosted after the signing last year of a treaty settling old disputes over borders and minorities.</p>
<p>Romania has 1.6 million ethic Hungarians, most of them living in the central Transylvania region, which was ruled by Austria-Hungary until 1918.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout our history, we have fought many wars against each other, and we were told that what divides us is more important than what unites us,&quot; said Ciorbea.</p>
<p>The two neighbours, he said, had put the past behind and had their eyes set on their common goals of NATO and EU membership.</p>
<p>&quot;It so happens we are still neighbours, and now we have to develop good neighbourliness, in the political, economic, and military fields,&quot; Ciorbea said.</p>
<p>Ciorbea made a dramatic plea for NATO to consider Romania along with Hungary for early NATO membership and to evaluate not only Romania's current position but also its potential following its new policies of reform.</p>
<p>&quot;Both countries need to concert their efforts to gain simultaneous access to NATO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO's expectations of Romania must not be based on a freeze-frame picture but on the processes going on and bearing in mind the prospect of future steps,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hungary, along with Poland and the Czech Republic, is deemed a front-runner for first-round enlargement of NATO, to be decided at a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Romania could not have hoped to make the list under its previous government, analysts said. But since the centre-right coalition ousted leftist president Ion Iliescu, Romania and Hungary have rapidly signed agreements to form a joint military battalion, open more border crossings and reopen and establish new consulates.</p>
<p>However, Horn struck a note of caution over Romanian aspirations to join NATO with Hungary.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO must decide when enlargement takes place and what countries will join. It is in our interest that Romania should join in the first group but every country has to comply with requirements of membership.&quot;</p>
<p>Horn, himself a Socialist, also paid tribute to Iliescu, under whose presidency the basic treaty, seen as a pre-requisite for the two countries to join the EU and NATO, was signed after years of sometimes tense negotiation.</p>
<p>&quot;Iliescu had a decisive role in signing the basic treaty,&quot; Horn said. &quot;We must not lose sight of this historical role -- I wish to express my thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>Later on Wedenesday, Ciorbea will meet businessmen at one of Hungary's top restaurants and will visit Szekesfehervar, the western Hungarian &quot;economic miracle&quot; town that is host to subsidiaries of major companies such as IBM and Philips.</p>
