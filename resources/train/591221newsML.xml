<p>Two workers were killed and three injured when a disused dog racing club building collapsed during demolition in a Miami suburb on Friday, firefighters said.</p>
<p>The five men were inside the Biscayne Kennel Club building when it collapsed. Rescue crews with search dogs brought out the three survivors and took them to a hospital, where they were reported to be in stable condition.</p>
<p>Workers were still trying to stabilise the structure to remove the bodies.</p>
<p>The building in Miami Shores, north of Miami, had been gutted. Workers planned to finish the demolition on Friday by knocking down the concrete load-bearing beams.</p>
<p>Investigators said they did not know what caused the structure to collapse prematurely, burying the workers under mounds of concrete and twisted metal.</p>
<p>The building, built in 1926, had been vacant since 1995 and was recently sold to Barry University.</p>
