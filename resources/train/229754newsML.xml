<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ dollar ends higher on resurgent Australian dlr.</title>
<headline>NZ dollar ends higher on resurgent Australian dlr.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The New Zealand dollar shrugged off political uncertainty to close sharply higher on Monday, due largely to a resurgent Australian currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Aussie is just about to breach 82 (US) cents and the Kiwi's being dragged up on the back of it,&quot; a chief dealer said.</p>
<p>The Kiwi closed at US$0.7135/42, up from 0.7118/25 at the open, but was unchanged on its Trade-Weighted Index at 67.10.</p>
<p>&quot;It's closing fairly bid. It's broken the 0.7130 level, where we thought sellers were all afternoon,&quot; said another dealer.  </p>
<p>He said the dollar had dipped slightly on comments by Labour Party finance spokesman Michael Cullen that the high exchange rate would be the first priority of a Labour-led government.</p>
<p>But there had been good buying out of Asia since mid-afternoon which, coupled with stop-loss buying, had seen the Kiwi spike higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We're trading up through quite key levels really,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Nationalist New Zealand First continues to negotiate separately with the conservative caretaker National government and centre-left Labour to form a coalition after the October 12 election.</p>
<p>An indication of which way NZ First will go is widely expected this week.</p>
<p>The dealer said he expected the Kiwi to be sold on either outcome. &quot;And I think it will rally on no outcome.&quot;  </p>
<p>The shape of the new government and future fiscal policy overshadowed Treasury's December Economic and Fiscal Update, in which it forecast slightly lower government surpluses than previously.</p>
<p>Dealers said the DEFU held no surprises and had little if any impact on the currency.</p>
<p>The Kiwi was seen testing higher overnight in a 0.7120-45 range. -- Matthew Brockett (64 4) 473-3736</p>
