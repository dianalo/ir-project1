<p>Peru said on Thursday it would decorate former Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki with its highest national honour -- the Order of the Sun -- despite his fall from grace in his homeland.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a show of support from the Peruvian government for the work of Morihisa Aoki,&quot; President Alberto Fujimori said.</p>
<p>The award recognised both Aoki's work in strengthening Peru-Japan relations, and his &quot;courage and dexterity&quot; during the four-month hostage crisis at his former home in Lima, Fujimori added.</p>
<p>Initially hailed in Japan as a hero who stoutly defended fellow hostages during the 126-day siege by Marxist rebels, Aoki drew criticism on his return home when attention switched from the captives' fate to how the incident happened.</p>
<p>He was fired from his post last week, but remains in Japan's Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>Fujimori said Peru's ambassador to Japan, Victor Aritomi, would present the award to Aoki later Thursday in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Aritomi's brother Pedro Aritomi was among the 72 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) at the diplomatic compound.</p>
<p>Peruvian troops released all but one of the hostages in an April 22 strike that killed the 14 MRTA rebels, and also left two soldiers and a captive judge dead.</p>
