<p>TV Markiza, the latest entry from the Bermuda-based Central European Media Enterprises (CME), said on Friday its signal will reach 60 percent of Slovakia's five million people when it launches on Saturday.</p>
<p>Slovenska Televizna Spolocnost (STS) which operates what will be the country's first nationwide commercial television station, is a joint venture of the local Markiza Slovakia s.r.o. which holds 51 percent, and CME .</p>
<p>CME, a venture co-founded by New York cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, is looking to build on its success in the neighbouring Czech Republic and elsewhere as a pop-culture alternative to the grey face of state TV in the old East Bloc.</p>
<p>&quot;Our rich experience with local partners in this region have convinced us that TV Markiza will fulfill all expectations and will become the most successful TV channel in Slovakia,&quot; CME executive chairman Leonard Fertig told a news conference.</p>
<p>CME covered the entire start-up investment in Markiza of one billion Slovak crowns ($33 million), while the main contribution of the Slovak partners was the licence.</p>
<p>CME holds major stakes in four commercial TV stations in central and eastern Europe, including the first and the most successful nationwide commercial television in the post-communist world -- TV Nova in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Fertig said CME would continue to expand its activities in the central and eastern Europe in the near future.</p>
<p>He said CME has amassed a cash pile of $200 million over the last few years and that it would be invested in TV projects mainly in Ukraine, Poland and Hungary.</p>
<p>Within the next two years, about 80 percent of the Slovak population should be able the receive Markiza's signal after the expansion of its network of transmitters in the more remote regions of hilly Slovakia.</p>
<p>Entry of Markiza in the Slovak television market signals an end to the almost total monopoly of Slovak Television (STV) and its two state-wide TV channels.</p>
<p>Formally, STV is an independent public service body, but the state indirectly controls it through the hiring and firing of top management.</p>
<p>Markiza has signalled its aim to capture Slovakia's viewers with an agressive month-long advertising campaign in all media, boasting of plans to air spicey serials and action films.</p>
<p>Like its sister Nova, Markiza will air loads of American soap operas, shoot-em-up movies, mixed with locally produced variety shows and tabloid-esque news programmes.</p>
<p>Experience from several similar projects in the region suggests Markiza might be able to take a 40 to 70 percent market share away from STV.</p>
<p>In the Czech Republic, TV Nova built a 70 percent market share in the first year after its launch in February 1994.</p>
<p>The total Slovak television advertising market is estimated to be currently worth around $40 million a year, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>According to latest research, the first programme of the official STV1 accounts for 49 percent of overall nationwide TV audience, with the rest split between the second public station STV2, another small cable station, and TV Nova where available.</p>
<p>STV flops in the western part of the country, where TV Nova accounts for around 60 percent of all Slovak viewers who can easily understand Czech.</p>
<p>But STV appears unphased by the new competition.</p>
<p>Jozef Darmo, the STV director appointed by the ruling majority in parliament, has said he was not afraid of losing advertising clients, as the major part of the STV revenue would still be covered by TV fees and the state budget.</p>
