<p>Russian shares edged up on Thursday with Norilsk Nickel engineering the rise, while the rest of the market remained quiet, traders said.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 22 shares rose by 1.06 percent to 497.82 on a low $36.61 million on total market volume.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is quite calm, the volumes are small,&quot; said CentreInvest Securities Alexander Pankov said. &quot;There was craziness going on around Norilsk Nickel, both ordinary and preferred shares.&quot;</p>
<p>Norilsk ordinaries closed at $16.00, off midday highs of $19.00, but higher than Wednesday's close of $13.40.</p>
<p>Norilsk preferred closed at $13.90, off a midday $14.00, but higher than the previous close of $9.75.</p>
<p>Pankov forecast the bid price for Norilsk ordinaries would rise to $20 in the next few days.</p>
<p>Regent European Securities trader Alexander Fonarkov attributed the rise to the forthcoming auction for a controlling 38 percent stake, bidding for which began on Tuesday. &quot;The market will go up slightly in the next few days if people do not start selling Norilsk,&quot; said Pankov. &quot;The trend is an upside one, although not steep.&quot;</p>
<p>Fonarkov said the market ignored government officials announcements on Thursday that national power utility UES forthcoming 5.4 trillion bond would be convertible into 5.4 percent of the company's shares, and the state stake would fall to 50 percent plus one share.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has already discounted this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>UES ordinaries fell to $0.4313 from $0.4174.</p>
<p>Pankov said most trade volumes were in less-liquid shares, which were only traded by telephone.</p>
