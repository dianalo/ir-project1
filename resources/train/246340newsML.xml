<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday accused Palestinians of trying to frighten Israel by creating a united hostile Arab front against his right-wing policies.</p>
<p>At the same time, an Israeli planning commission approved a plan for Jewish housing in the heart of an Arab neighbourhood in East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in 1967 but seen by Palestinians as the capital of a future state. It now needs ministerial approval to go ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Palestinians) are trying also to unite the Arab world and via that to scare the Israeli public, to cause people to believe that we really can't defend ourselves, that there will be a war here any minute,&quot; Netanyahu told Israel's army radio.</p>
<p>&quot;The Arabs are waging a psychological war against us, are trying to create a sort of comprehensive Arab front and threaten us with wars and intifadas (uprisings)...with the goal of weakening our position and our just demands.&quot;</p>
<p>He also suggested the Palestinian Authority was trying to acquire anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, weapons barred from it under accords setting up self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>Palestinian Authority Secretary General Tayeb Abdel-Rahim called the missile charge &quot;completely false&quot;. Israel controls borders to Palestinian areas.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's charges were the latest shots in mutual recrimination over stalled talks on Israel's long-delayed handover of most of the West Bank town of Hebron to PLO rule.</p>
<p>The Hebron talks are being watched by Arab states as a test of Netanyahu's commitment to the Arab-Israeli peace process pursued by the Israeli government he ousted in May elections. He has rejected the principle of returning occupied land for peace that underlay the talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said his political adviser, Dore Gold, would go to Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the Hebron talks with Egyptian officials who have been trying to mediate.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu's statements are a continuous attempt to attack the Palestinian Authority and are unfounded,&quot; PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters after the Israeli leader spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;The failure to reach agreement is because...he continues (to try) to change the (peace) accords signed in 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel's previous government signed the deal to hand over most of Hebron more than a year ago. Netanyahu wants more security for some 400 militant Jewish settlers who live amid 100,000 Arabs in the town Israel captured with the rest of the West Bank in 1967.</p>
<p>In September, Israel ringed Palestinian self-rule enclaves in the West Bank with tanks after battles between Israeli and Palestinian forces triggered by Israel opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in East Jerusalem's Old City.</p>
<p>Sixty Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed in the fighting. Israel media said at the time its army had put in motion a plan that would ultimately have involved re-invading self-rule enclaves.</p>
<p>Palestinians have warned that the proposal to site Jewish housing in East Jerusalem's Ras al-Amud Arab neighbourhood could provoke similar outrage.</p>
<p>The future of East Jerusalem, which Israel vows never to leave, is supposed to be negotiated in final peace talks that have not resumed since Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
