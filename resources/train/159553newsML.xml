<p>European liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) prices weathered a bearish storm which swept U.S. propane and crude markets on Thursday on strong local demand and rising prices in the Middle East, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Belvieu came off yesterday but LPG in Europe is still very strong,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Propane cargoes gained $10 over the week to trade at $277.00-$278.50 cif northern Europe, and several companies were still short for November.</p>
<p>The North Sea was buoyed by demand from local consumers and also requirements in the Mediterranean and Latin America, particularly Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices in the Middle East are very high and we see some players in the Mediterranean and Latin America looking for alternative sources,&quot; a North Sea producer said. Algeria offered $300 cif for a propane cargo requirement in Lavera, southern France.</p>
<p>Butane, which has lagged propane over the past two weeks, surged by about $25 to talk around $260 cif NWE, dealers said.</p>
<p>One major North Sea producer said the BP posted price of $232 for butane was much too low, being based on a deal two weeks before at $244 cif.</p>
