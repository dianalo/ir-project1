<title>USA: Moscow Circus eyes possible new home in Florida.</title>
<headline>Moscow Circus eyes possible new home in Florida.</headline>
<dateline>ORLANDO, Fla. 1997-01-17</dateline>

<p>The Moscow Circus, one of Europe's premiere entertainment attractions, is looking for another home and may settle in Florida, the company's North American agent said on Friday.</p>
<p>On February 14 the circus will begin a six-month residency in central Florida, near such established tourist attractions as Walt Disney World and Universal Studios. If all goes well, said New York-based promoter Alex Valdez, Orlando will become the troupe's second permanent home.</p>
<p>&quot;Orlando really has become the mecca for entertainment,&quot; Valdez said. &quot;The next six months will give me the chance to see if the business is there to sustain it.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the breakup of the Soviet Union many of Russia's state-supported arts institutions have fallen on hard times. The Bolshoi Ballet lost many of its best dancers to the West, and the Moscow Circus faces the same fate unless it can generate new revenues. Unlike circuses in the United States, many European circuses are not designed to tour.</p>
<p>Although the Moscow troupe has toured the United States in recent years, that has never been an attractive option, Valdez said. Valdez said the Orlando area was chosen for its ready tourist base and its moderate climate.</p>
<p>&quot;If the circus is successful in Orlando, it will absolutely sustain the circus in Moscow,&quot; Valdez said.</p>
