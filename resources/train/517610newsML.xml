<p>The slump in implied volatilities for U.S. interest rate options continued Thursday while the underlying futures attempted to make headway above 108-00 before the rally lost momentum and prices drifted from the highs.</p>
<p>June volatility held around 8.25 percent for most of the session, about where it settled on Wednesday, keeping in suspense for another day those who expect a bottom to be found soon.</p>
<p>&quot;It's incredibly low. No one can believe how low it is,&quot; remarked one options trader on the bond floor.  </p>
<p>Options traders said bond calls were hit a little on the rally, but with volatilities so low, out-of-the-money calls were becoming too cheap to sell, prompting some long-term bears to switch to buying puts instead.</p>
<p>Early in the session, a European banking firm was seen buying 3,000 June 106 puts at premiums of 22/64 to 24/64. Several large investment houses also were noted buyers of June puts in the 106-00 and 107-00 strikes, bond floor sources said.  </p>
<p>June bond futures ended at 107-27, for a gain of 12/32 on the day, after a weak Philadelphia Federal Reserve business activity survey touched off short-covering.</p>
<p>One day before May options go off the board, market participants were exiting positions, with one house unloading a large quantity of 108-00 and 109-00 calls.</p>
<p>As in bond options, volatilities remained extremely low at the short end of the yield curve, where September Eurodollar volatility edged up 0.2 point to 10.2 percent and December was unchanged at 12.0 percent.  </p>
<p>Volatility dropped sharply in June midcurve options, to 15.0 percent late in the day from 15.8 percent previously.</p>
<p>The short-dated June options, which expire in 1997 but are priced from 1998 futures, traded briskly in the 93.00 strike, Eurodollar brokers said. At least 12,000 of the puts changed hands, with a single house selling 10,000 contracts, according to floor estimates.</p>
<p>September midcurve volatility was off 0.2 point at 15.6 percent.</p>
