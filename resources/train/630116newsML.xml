<p>United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday hailed President Laurent Kabila for ending despotic rule in the former Zaire, and called on him to protect refugees and secure the rule of law in his renamed Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>In his first address to an Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit since he was elected last year as the U.N.'s first leader from a sub-Saharan nation, Ghanaian Annan said Kabila, whose seven-month rebel campaign drove former president Mobutu Sese Seko from power last month, had a historic opportunity to set his country on a new path.</p>
<p>&quot;A long period of despotic rule has been brought to an end, and a truly historic opportunity beckons,&quot; he said of Mobutu, whose 32-year-old regime was regarded by many as one of the continent's most repressive and corrupt.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome President Kabila's commitment to constitutional rule and to the holding of democratic elections,&quot; Annan said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council, alarmed by reports of massacres of Rwandan refugees, on Thursday called for an immediate end to violence against the exiles in Kabila's Congo. The refugees are remnants of more than one million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape reprisals for the genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
<p>Investigators have so far been refused access to suspected mass graves by Kabila's Tutsi-dominated army.</p>
<p>Annan told Kabila in his address to the OAU summit that it was not too late to handle the refugee problem in a humane manner.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa, a cabinet minister said there was no evidence Rwandan Hutu refugees were being massacred in Congo.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether it is an official of the United Nations or whoever that makes these allegations they should not be made lightly and without verification,&quot; Information Minister Raphael Ghenda told Reuters when asked about Annan's statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The word massacre no longer carries the weight it once did, and for anybody to make allegations without evidence is pure and simple irresponsibility,&quot; Ghenda said.</p>
<p>Annan said: &quot;It is necessary even now that the protection of human life, the full respect of human life, is given the highest priority and that the rule of law should quickly return to that country...</p>
<p>&quot;The U.N. asks that we may tend to the weak and to the displaced so that this new beginning may be an acclamation and affirmation of the sanctity of life.&quot;</p>
<p>Annan is expected to meet Kabila on the sidelines of the OAU summit that ends on Wednesday.</p>
