<p>European fuel barges perked up on Thursday with the help of pre-weekend bunker demand while low sulphur markets were still hesitant, traders said.</p>
<p>After a deal at $81 fob a tonne for high sulphur in Rotterdam, barge offers rose to $83 a tonne, $1-$2 higher than yesterday. Bunker demand was reported healthy.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no news affecting it. Its just bumping along the bottom as normal,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Low sulphur swaps were fractionally weaker, reflecting the market's rather stilted character, traders said.</p>
<p>A German trader was heard to have bought the British barrels sold to a U.S. refiner by a dealer last Friday. Last week's deal at $95 a tonne fob surprised the market so much no other material has been seen traded since.</p>
<p>The German trader was heard to have paid the average of June quotes plus a small premium and was believed to be taking the material to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>&quot;This material is just getting passed around and nothing else is really happening,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Russian material was appearing with greater frequency in the north, traders said.  </p>
<p>A cracked M-100 was sold into the Spanish bunker market yesterday and the same buyer bought a vessel of M-100 straight-run for refinery use.</p>
