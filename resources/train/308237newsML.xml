<p>Ghana's 1996/97 cocoa arrivals will pick up from January after late rains, with output seen closer to an expected 350,000 tonnes crop than previously thought, bullish Ghana cocoa buyers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cocoa did not come in early because the rains stopped late. But there is a lot of cocoa in the field,&quot; said one buyer.</p>
<p>Heavy July and August rain when the pods were small caused general rot but the buyers cited reports of better pod loads than expected, in part also due to the rain.</p>
<p>Ghana opened its 1996/97 main crop season on October 11 with farmgate prices unchanged from the 1995/96 light crop prices of 36,000 cedis per 30 kg load of grade one and grade two, or 75,000 per 60 kg bag.</p>
<p>Above average rains have fallen in cocoa belt regions in January.</p>
<p>Last Sunday 12.1 mm were recorded in Kumasi and 10.33 mm in Takoradi against long-term averages of 5.0 mm and 5.8 mm repectively, national weather data show.</p>
<p>&quot;In the early and middle part of the season we did not buy much cocoa, but after Christmas it really started coming in,&quot; said an official at the Kuapo Kokoo Co. cooperative which buys from 5,000 farmers in Ashanti, Western and Brong Ahafo regions.</p>
<p>An outbreak of fungal black pod disease bought on by cool damp conditions in the Brong Ahafo region last September left farmers concerned about prospects for 1996/97.</p>
<p>But traders now said they expected Ghana's main cocoa crop season (Oct-Apr) to extend into April as rains since had also raised pod loads.</p>
<p>The main crop season was closed on April 4 last year. The light crop season ran from June 7 to October 11.</p>
<p>Traders said Ghana's COCOBOD marketing board had bought 192,500 tonnes of cocoa by week 13 in early January against 269,500 tonnes by that time in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Experts have blamed low farmgate prices and ageing trees for yields of only 200 kg/hectare, a third below levels in neighbouring Ivory Coast -- the world's largest producer.</p>
<p>Ghana's finance minister, Richard Kwame Peprah, recently told Reuters his ministry was perusing cocoa sector liberalisation proposals submitted by private British consultancy Landell Mills.</p>
<p>Opposition parties in campaigning for December's national elections called for liberalisation of export marketing. The ruling National Democratic Party under eventually re-elected Jerry Rawlings promised higher precentages of fob export prices for farmers of 55 or 60 percent by year 2000.</p>
