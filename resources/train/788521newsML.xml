<p>European stock markets extended their slide lower by mid-afternoon on Friday, depressed by another sharp drop on Wall Street and weakness in the dollar and U.S. bond prices.</p>
<p>Sterling, hit hard by official indications that further British interest rate rises were off the menu in the near future, also suffered further heavy selling ahead of the weekend and the dollar weakened in its wake.</p>
<p>&quot;The sterling bubble has well and truly burst,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro.</p>
<p>The pound shed more than six pfennigs from an early high against the mark, dropping below 2.92 marks before reviving, and hit a 10-month low against the dollar.</p>
<p>Wall Street, whose relentless rise to new peaks has helped drive European markets higher, lost more than 100 points or 1.3 percent on the Dow Jones industrial average inside 15 minutes of the New York opening.</p>
<p>This retreat, amid fears of higher U.S. interest rates, added to a drop of 71 points in the Dow on Thursday.</p>
<p>Losses on the London stock market promptly reached 1.5 percent, while the Frankfurt and Paris bourses were more than two percent adrift. But all rose from their depths as Wall Street soon halved its deficit in volatile trading.</p>
<p>The pound had gained around a quarter against major currencies so far this year but a weakening from recent peaks had taken some pressure off British exporters and helped boost London shares to new records.</p>
<p>The London stock market, Europe's biggest, hit new highs on Thursday when the Bank of England indicated that interest rates might not have to rise again for a while after the latest quarter point increase to seven percent.</p>
<p>But Friday's renewed decline in the pound gave no further support to British shares, which retreated on profit-taking. Market attention shifted to smaller capitalised stocks.</p>
<p>Frankfurt shares also fell as investors cashed in profits after strong recent gains and as the dollar slipped -- bad news for exporters. However, German bank shares tried to resist the trend amid a fresh wave of takeover speculation.</p>
<p>In Paris, too, profit taking and the easing of the dollar helped send the bourse lower.</p>
<p>But before suffering in sympathy with sterling, the dollar had revived from an early downward blip against the mark.</p>
<p>On reflection, currency market operators viewed the German economy as too weak to withstand higher interest rates to boost the mark despite comments by a central banker suggesting the Bundesbank did not want the mark to weaken further -- or the dollar to strengthen any more.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a good time for a rate hike,&quot; said Stefan Schilbe, economist at Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt in Dusseldorf.</p>
<p>Bundesbank Council member Ernst Welteke, speaking on German radio, said the central bank had already signalled it thought the dollar's correction was completed at 1.70 marks. This drove the dollar down as low as 1.8625 marks early on.</p>
<p>But traders eventually focused more on the fact that he also said slow German economic growth and high unemployment meant it was not appropriate to &quot;turn the interest rate screw&quot;. The dollar then rose above 1.87 marks, only to slip almost to 1.85 later.</p>
<p>Speculation that the Bundesbank will act to boost money market rates has grown as the dollar has scored near eight-year highs in recent weeks. There was also nervousness that the central bank could intervene to stem the mark's slide after Welteke said the Bundesbank had no exact date for intervening in currency markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar also retreated against the yen, affected by market concern that a widening in Japan's trade surplus with the United States could spark renewed trade tensions.</p>
<p>A report showed Japan's current account surplus leapt nearly 56 percent in June from a year earlier and that the trade surplus rose nearly 19 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>Market analysts expect Japanese officials to protest against any dollar gains above 120 yen to ward off a tougher stance on trade by the U.S. administration</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8550 marks and 116.88 yen, compared with 1.8744 and 118.55 in late trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sterling was at 2.9280 marks and $1.5779, down from 2.9695 marks and $1.5861 on Thursday, after lows of 2.9185 and $1.5672.</p>
