<p>A Hong Kong protest ship may try again on Thursday to reach disputed islands in the East China Sea in a bid to reclaim them from Japan after being thwarted by bad weather in their first attempt, Taiwan radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently the ... ship has left waters near the Diaoyus, but they have not really given up their plan to force their way ashore,&quot; the state-run radio said without giving a source for its report. &quot;They claim they will return to waters in the vicinity of the Diaoyus.&quot;  </p>
<p>The rusty tanker, the Kien Hwa 2, had pushed to within two nautical miles of the islands claimed by Japan as the Senkakus and by Taiwan and by China as the Diaoyus, but bad weather and heavy seas forced it abandon the attempt.</p>
<p>The broadcast confirmed Hong Kong radio and television reports that the protest vessel had been circled by Japanese frigates and helicopters, but did not say whether there had been any encounters.</p>
<p>Hong Kong activists aboard the ship had pledged to go ashore to plant China's national flag and pull down the Japanese flag and a lighthouse built in July by Japanese ultra-nationalists.</p>
<p>On Monday Japanese coast guard vessels and a helicopter repulsed a flotilla of Taiwan fishing boats that had tried to land anti-Japanese protesters on the islands.</p>
