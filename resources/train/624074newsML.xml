<p>Nike Inc said Thursday it expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 31 of $0.51 to $0.56 per share, below analysts' consensus estimate of $0.69.</p>
<p>Nike said the estimates included a one-time pre-tax charge of $18 million, or $0.04 per share. The charge is primarily related to the shutdown of a manufacturing facility at the company's Bauer Inc unit as part of a long-term plan to reposition some manufacturing facilities to more cost-effective overseas operations, Nike said.  </p>
<p>The company also said its revenues would be below analysts' estimates for the quarter amid &quot;shifts in the mix of futures and at-once orders, timing of shipments in Europe, product shortages, and a slight increase in U.S. order cancellations.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the warnings on the fourth quarter, Nike said its projected revenues and earnings for the full fiscal year would be up more than 40 percent from fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>It said it expects revenue growth in fiscal 1998 in excess of its previously stated long-term annual goal of 15 percent.  </p>
<p>Nike said it expects to report fourth quarter results in early July.</p>
<p>Nike shares rose 3-1/2 Wednesday to 63-1/2 on speculation that billionaire investor Warren Buffett likes Nike as an investment. On Tuesday the stock gained 3-3/4.</p>
