<p>Opposition leader Tony Blair, launching the Labour Party's manifesto for a May 1 election, made 10 promises on Thursday in a &quot;contract with the people&quot; to govern Britain from the political centre ground.</p>
<p>A day after the ruling Conservatives launched their policy blueprint, Blair promised not to raise income tax rates, to guarantee low inflation, to get thousands of young people back to work and to show leadership in Europe.</p>
<p>Blair, fighting to win power for his party after 18 years in the political wilderness, said there were no quick fixes.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no magic wands or instant solutions. What we do say is: Britain deserves better, and Britain can be better.</p>
<p>&quot;And we show how. We do so only by promising what we can deliver,&quot; said the Labour leader, who has drastically overhauled his party since he took power three years ago, ditching its old dogmas and trappings and dragging it into the centre.</p>
<p>Blair told a news conference he was not dismissing all the changes made by the Conservatives since they took power in 1979.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some things the Conservatives got right.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some things they got badly wrong; a divided society, an education system that is failing our children, overcentralisation of government, failure in Europe. These are the things that new Labour can put right,&quot; said Blair.</p>
<p>But Blair, whose party led the Conservatives by 27 points in the latest poll in Thursday's Times newspaper, said this did not mean Labour's manifesto was a pale copy of the ruling party's.</p>
<p>&quot;I defy anyone to deny this is a radical programme. But it is in the radical centre of politics, modern, forward-looking, utterly in tune with the times and instincts of today's Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, in other words, New Labour, neither a programme of the left nor of today's Conservatives. It breaks new ground and seeks to build genuine support in all parts of the nation behind it. That is what we offer to Britain today. A fresh start.&quot;</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine immediately called the manifesto a &quot;surrender&quot; to the trade unions.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major, on a campaign tour in the north of England, targeted Labour's plans to devolve power to Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>&quot;Careless, reckless, ill-thought through, Mr Blair's plans would start an avalanche of separatism, sweeping away the richness of our past and the promise of our future,&quot; Major said.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown described Labour's pledges as &quot;all warm words and woolly phrases&quot;.</p>
<p>But Blair said that, with the publication of the programmes of the two main parties, voters now had a real choice &quot;between the future and the past, between a party for the many and a party for the few, between leadership and drift&quot;.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Labour leader, who is bidding to become Britain's youngest prime minister this century and who needs only a 4.3 percent swing from the 1992 election to take power, said he was not complacent.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the historic opportunity for the Labour Party, this election, to become a modern party of progress and justice... If we blow this opportunity we blow our place in history -- It's as simple as that. We've no intention of doing that,&quot; said Blair.</p>
<p>In the manifesto Blair said education would be his &quot;Number One priority&quot;. He also vowed to use a windfall tax on surplus profits of water, gas, electricity and other firms privatised by the Conservatives to take 250,000 people out of the dole queues.</p>
<p>Other pledges included more money to treat patients in the National Health Service, the safeguarding of the environment, a clean-up of politics following a bout of sleaze and to &quot;give Britain the leadership in Europe which Britain and Europe need&quot;.</p>
<p>On the issue of a European single currency he confirmed that the issue would be put to the British public in a referendum but that the government would keep its options open.</p>
