<title>USA: AT&amp;T, Baby Bell merger &quot;unthinkable&quot; - FCC's Hundt.</title>
<headline>AT&amp;T, Baby Bell merger &quot;unthinkable&quot; - FCC's Hundt.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>The nation's top phone regulator Thursday said a merger between AT&amp;T Corp and a regional Baby Bell would be &quot;unthinkable.&quot;</p>
<p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt, in a major speech on anti-trust policy, said he was not commenting specifically on a possible merger of AT&amp;T and SBC Communications Inc. But he made clear that his comments encompassed such a possible corporate marriage, citing AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen's recent statement that a merger between AT&amp;T and a Baby Bell could help competition.  </p>
<p>&quot;A combination of AT&amp;T and an RBOC (regional Bell operating company) is unthinkable,&quot; Hundt said in a speech at the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>The FCC Chairman raised concerns about how such a combination could hurt competition in telephone markets.</p>
<p>&quot;AT&amp;T is currently present in the same geographic markets as each and every RBOC. In each RBOC region, the Bell and AT&amp;T offer service to the same customers. They have parallel and not wholly dissimilar facilities,&quot; Hundt said.</p>
<p>Hundt said his comments did not apply to the current merger pending before the FCC involving NYNEX Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp.</p>
<p>Although Hundt has announced his plans to leave the FCC, his comments are considered important, analysts said. The FCC Chairman has close ties to vice president Al Gore and so his thoughts are believed to reflect Clinton administration concern about a possible merger of AT&amp;T and SBC.</p>
