<p>Russian inflation is likely to drop to Western-style single-digit levels next year, with yields on government bonds tumbling to record lows by the end of this year, top officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told a meeting of senior Finance Ministry officials and parliamentary deputies that the government expected inflation to be between five and eight percent next year.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Anatoly Chubais was even more optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we shall be aiming for the tougher parameter -- five percent,&quot; Chubais, who is also First Deputy Prime Minister, told the meeting.</p>
<p>The government is targeting annual inflation -- measured by the year-on-year increase in prices in December -- of 12 percent this year, down from 21.8 percent in 1996. In 1992 when prices were freed as reforms started, inflation was some 2,500 percent.</p>
<p>Squeezing inflation out of the system has been one of the few obvious economic successes of post-Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>The economy itself is still stagnant after seven years of contraction and Chubais repeated recent forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) would grow two percent in 1998.</p>
<p>Until recently officials had said growth this year would be two percent.</p>
<p>But officials said there would be no radical changes to the formulas that have delivered the fall in inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too early to say exactly what currency policy model will be finally adopted for 1998, but the Central Bank assumes that there will not be any dramatic changes, either in technical management, or in connection with currency and monetary policy,&quot; Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin told the meeting.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has pegged the rouble in a currency band, known as a sloping corridor, which allows it to depreciate slowly at a predictable rate.</p>
<p>The rouble, trading at about 5,750 per dollar on Tuesday, will be in a 5,730-6,350 per dollar range at the end of the year against 5,500-6,100 at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Since the corridor system started in mid-1995, after the Central Bank had steadied the rouble following sharp falls in the previous years, the rouble has never strayed outside the daily range, or even moved outside the much narrower bid/offer rates set by the Central Bank within the daily corridor.</p>
<p>The steady rouble is one factor behind the inflation slowdown, but restraint in government borrowing, even though tax revenues are running well below budgeted levels, is another.</p>
<p>&quot;We will stick to the corresponding numbers of the budget deficit this year, but I must tell you frankly that we are at the limit and have no leeway,&quot; Dubinin said.</p>
<p>Since late last year the Finance Ministry, keen to get interest rates down to encourage banks to lend to industry, has been borrowing only enough on the Treasury bill market to repay maturing T-bills.</p>
<p>A warm reception for Russia's first two Eurobonds in November last year and March this year means Moscow has been able to shift its new borrowing to foreign lenders.</p>
<p>Dubinin forecast yields on Treasury bills would fall to a record low 20 percent by the end of this year, as long as the inflation target was met. The average T-bill yield on the secondary market on Monday was 25.1 percent -- which still provides a real rouble return of about 10 percent.</p>
<p>Chubais said new domestic and foreign borrowing next year would be only 0.5 percent of GDP. Debt servicing costs next year would be 4.5 percent of GDP, Chubais said.</p>
<p>He said the budget deficit next year, according to international methods which include borrowing costs, would be about five percent of GDP, down from about seven percent this year. According to Russian calculations excluding borrowing costs, the budget deficit this year is targeted at 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said servicing Russia's domestic and foreign now takes up about one third of government revenues.</p>
