<p>When Malaysian companies began investing in Cambodia in 1994, they were drawn by the prospect of growth from an economy emerging from chaos.</p>
<p>Now, with the forces of its two prime ministers in pitched battle, Cambodia's biggest investor is joining the ranks of other concerned countries that have put money into roads, hotels, banks, logging sites and telecommunications.</p>
<p>On Monday, forces loyal to Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen appeared to be in complete control of the capital Phnom Penh and its outskirts as troops loyal to First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh abandoned their stronghold near the city.</p>
<p>Foreign investors in some Asian countries said they are not fleeing.</p>
<p>Ariston Sdn Bhd, a Malaysian property developer that is the single largest foreign investor in Cambodia with a $1.3 billion project, said in a statement it is &quot;monitoring the political development in Phnom Penh very closely and shall not take any risks&quot;. It did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Malaysia has invested $3 billion in Cambodia, with projects that also include a 40 percent stake in national airliner Royal Air Cambodge, operation of petrol stations and bank branches as well as construction of a satellite town outside Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned (about our investments), but not too pessimistic,&quot; Malaysian Finance Minister and acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday.</p>
<p>Indonesia's state-controlled PT Indonesian Satellite Corp (Indosat) said on Monday it remained committed to its 49 percent stake in Cambodian telecommunications firm Camintel, S.A.</p>
<p>It was also optimistic about the company's earnings prospects. &quot;We expect the firm to reach the break-even point either in 1998 or 1999 despite the latest political developments,&quot; Indosat investor relations manager Budi Prasetyo told Reuters.</p>
<p>Foreign investors may be facing the crisis calmly because the amount of money actually put into the projects is relatively small, analysts said.</p>
<p>Singapore's DBS Land Ltd's total investments in Cambodia are just under one percent of the group's total assets, which currently stand at S$8 billion ($5.59 billion), an official said. It has invested in two hotels, one in Phnom Penh and one in Siem Reap.</p>
<p>Individual Malaysian corporations probably have not put out that much money, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The investments made by these companies are quite small,&quot; said Haizan Johari, manager of investments at KL Mutual Unit Trusts. &quot;They are currently insignificant to the bottom line...any disruption in these businesses should not cause much impact, worry or fear.&quot;</p>
<p>Businesses are also hopeful there will still be opportunities, no matter who is in charge. &quot;There still needs to be somebody to be running some business,&quot; said Jeffrey Han, general manager in charge of Malaysian timber firm Samling Corp Sdn Bhd's Cambodia operations said.</p>
<p>But the chill is spreading, business people say.   &quot;We hope</p>
<p>they can resolve this problem as fast as possible,&quot; said Taiwan carrier EVA Air spokesman Nieh Kuo-wei. EVA had planned to fly three direct round trips a week from April, but now says it must wait for the political dust to settle.</p>
<p>&quot;Who would like to go there now since the situation is chaotic,&quot; a Thai government spokesman told Reuters. &quot;...It would delay foreign investment in the country for the time being.&quot;</p>
<p>Philippine Foreign Affairs Department officials said the country was closely watching developments in Cambodia because of the 500 Filipino workers in that country.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know of any major Philippine investment in Cambodia. But what we are monitoring now is the safety of the Filipino workers in that country,&quot; a department official said.</p>
