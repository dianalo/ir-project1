<text>
<p>Croatian stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with mild gains among blue chips and traders said the market would remain bullish for some time to come.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for Istrian hoteliers is quite strong at the moment and they are on the rise,&quot; a trader at the I.F.C. brokerage and consultancy said.</p>
<p>He added their growth could be ascribed to speculation about their foreign share placement and participation of foreign investors.</p>
<p>He also predicted new gains for confectioner Kras, and a possible period of stagnation for drugs firm Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka, in line with developments in London.</p>
<p>* Of 13 active issues, seven rose, three fell and three were flat.</p>

<p>* Daily share volume down at 12,214, total turnover including bonds slighlty lower at 43.4 million kuna.</p>
<p>* Central bank's exchange rate: 5.4317 kuna = $1. -- Laura Lui, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
