<p>U.S. spot liquefied petroleum gas prices were mixed midday Tuesday in the second consecutive day of slow-moving trade, players said.</p>
<p>Part of the lackluster activity is due to the volatility seen on NYMEX this week. In addition, few LPG players are in need of product now that winter has ended.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is a bit jittery about crude and that's keeping us quiet,&quot; said one LPG broker. Crude earlier today shed its two-week old contango as funds rolled their short positions into the back month.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the burnout phase&quot; after winter, said a Midwest trader. &quot;No one really needs to do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>In the U.S. Gulf Coast, Mont Belvieu, Texas, spot propane stayed steady at between 34.25 cents and 34.50 cents a gallon. Conway material was slightly stronger at 34.50/34.75 cents following 34.50-cent deals.</p>
<p>Market players said they were waiting for Venezuela's announcement soon on the winner of its tender for 60,000 tonnes of propane. Offers closed on Monday.</p>
<p>The ethane markets, meanwhile, were lower in both hubs amid little activity and weaker cash prices at the Henry Hub, La., as cooler-than-normal weather continued throughout most of the East and Midwest.</p>
<p>Belvieu ethane purity was down about quarter to 18.00/18.25 cents and mix ws 17.00/17.25 cents. Conway ethane was 14.00/14.75 cents.</p>
<p>Normal butane was steady in both hubs, players said. ((--Laney Salisbury, New York Energy Desk 1212 859-1631))</p>
