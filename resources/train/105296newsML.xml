<p>Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) is expected to post net profit of 4.53 billion pesos in the first nine months of the year, averages from a poll of five stock brokerages on Wednesday showed.</p>
<p>Last year in the first nine months, PLDT reported net profit of 4.6 billion pesos but that figure was boosted by an extraordinary gain of 1.154 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Compared to last year's profits minus the extraordinary gains, the predictions showed that PLDT would post a 30 percent growth in profits over the same period last year.  </p>
<p>The firm's extraordinary gain last year had come from the sale of shares in its cellular phone unit Pilipino Telephone Corp.</p>
<p>In the first six months this year, PLDT which is the country's dominant telecommunications company, reported a net profit of 2.917 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Analysts said the firm's year-old drive to cut costs and become efficient had begun to pay off. PLDT used to be a virtual monopoly until three years ago when the government opened the sector to competition.  </p>
<p>To face the growing competition, PLDT began a massive expansion programme and also started cutting costs by measures which included retrenchment of workers.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of PLDT's cost-cutting measures is taking hold. They have reduced manpower and additional phone lines forming part of its Zero Backlog Program are in place and on schedule,&quot; Saturnino Mejia, research head at Guoco Securities, said.</p>
<p>Cilette Liboro, research head at Citisecurities Inc, said that although the 4.28 billion pesos profits will largely come from international calls, domestic calls are starting to account for a substantial portion of PLDT's earnings.  </p>
<p>Some 72 percent of the telephone company's revenues for the first three quarters will come from international long distance calls, said Raul Ruiz, vice-president for research at Sun Hung Kai Securities (Philippines) Inc.</p>
<p>The recent reduction in accounting rates, the cost of international calls, from $1.20 per minute to $1 will not create a significant dent in the carrier's revenues, analysts said.</p>
<p>International gateway facility (IGF) operators have a 50-50 revenue sharing scheme with their foreign counterparts and a reduction of the rates will mean lesser revenues.  </p>
<p>&quot;Even if accounting rates decline, the volume is bigger as more lines are being installed and so lower rates are offset by greater number of calls,&quot; Dick Puig, senior analyst at Peregrine Securities (Phils) Inc said.</p>
<p>Analysts added that competition from other carriers such as ICC Telecoms is not likely to eat into PLDT's market share, at least not in the immediate term.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of start-up companies but how many lines have they connected? At the end of the day, it's still PLDT that people turn to,&quot; said Kevin Khoe, analyst at Sapphire Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;Metering will be an exciting development as it will initially bring about a 20 percent jump in revenues,&quot; said Alexis Cabel, analyst at Ang Ping &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>Starting next year, PLDT along with other telecom firms are planning to adopt a metering scheme on calls instead of the existing flat rate scheme.</p>
