<title>SPAIN: Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</title>
<headline>Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-04-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spanish government bonds ended with modest losses on Thursday, but off session lows, lifted by buoyancy in the core markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade was dull and the market lacked direction, at least in the short run.</p>
<p>&quot;We got scared by Tietmeyer's comments. It's true the Bundesbank's position is very well known...but any time he says something about EMU there are still fears,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said there were no signs the Bonn government was resorting to creative accounting methods to reach the targets for membership of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>With little domestic news in sight, dealers said foreign investors were shifting money to Italy, where preliminary inflation data are due at the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>The differential between Italy and Spain fell to close at around 69 basis points. Dealers expected it to slim even further on Friday.</p>
<p>Spain's yield curve steepened again, with the spread between the two- and 10-year bonds rising back to around 135 basis points. &quot;Despite an aggressive easing policy, people see more cuts on the horizon,&quot; a dealer in Madrid said.</p>
