<p>Western investors in Hungary's energy sector said on Monday they planned to initiate talks with the government about energy prices because they did not assure them of promised profits.</p>
<p>They said 1997 energy price rises, announced on Saturday, will not generate the promised eight percent return on investment for them, breaching the law and the privatisation contracts of Hungary's energy companies. @</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, the law is not respected and neither are the contracts,&quot; Pierre About, a representative of Electricite de France (EdF) told Reuters.</p>
<p>A number of western investors, including Germany's RWE and Electricite de France, bought substantial stakes in Hungarian energy companies a year ago.</p>
<p>The government announced in November retail prices rises of 24.9 percent for electricity and 18.8 percent for gas but did not define the margins which would be granted to individual energy producers and distributors. @</p>
<p>Figures defining the margins were announced by the minister of Industry and Trade on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have problems with the eight percent margin,&quot; RWE's representative in Hungary, Andreas Przetak said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are much lower than the eight percent profit,&quot; said About. @</p>
<p>He said investors would discuss the situation and act together. The most likely move was that they would initiate negotiations with the government about the prices, though EdF &quot;will also consider other measures,&quot; Abou said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The Hungarian energy sector was the first in eastern Europe to be privatised. Western utilities have already invested over $2 billion and plan further investments. @</p>
<p>But lower than expected profits will curb investment.</p>
<p>&quot;We will analyse how big profits will be and we will have to look at the investment plans,&quot; Przetak said. &quot;There is a connection.&quot;</p>
<p>Belgian utility Tractebel said recently that it may pull out of its investment in the power station at Dunamenti.</p>
<p>Tractebel also said that it was considering legal action against the Hungarian government for not fulfiling its obligations undertaken in privatisation contracts. @</p>
