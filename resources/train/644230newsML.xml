<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court finds France and Spain late to transpose waste rules.</title>
<headline>Court finds France and Spain late to transpose waste rules.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice said on Thursday France and Spain were late to adopt Community rules on waste.</p>
<p>Directive 91/156 amending directive 75/442 on waste was to be transposed into national law by April, 1993. The Commission undertook a formal process of communication with France and Spain, which the court said was procedurally and substantively correct.</p>
<p>Directive 91/156 ensures the safe removal and recovery of waste and encourages measures to restrict the production of waste by promoting clean technologies and products which can be recycled and reused, according to court documents.</p>
<p>The court did not accept Spain's argument that the delay in adopting the directive was caused by the dissolution of the Spainish parliament and the most recent general election, in March 1996.</p>
