<p>Cobalt was the feature of the minor industrial metals market over the past week against its backdrop of the civil war in Zaire, European traders said.</p>
<p>News of a $1 billion deal between Zaire rebels and a big Western mining company on Tuesday underscored the African country's vast potential as a supplier of minerals to the global economy.</p>
<p>However, traders and analysts doubted if the deal, or what seemed to be a likely rebel victory in the civil war, would have much short-term impact on cobalt supply or prices.</p>
<p>On Wednesday America Mineral Fields Inc signed an agreement worth $1 billion with Zaire's rebels to buy the Kolwezi copper/cobalt tailings project and also build a 200,000 tonnes a year zinc plant at Kipushi.</p>
<p>The deal involves deposits and mines under the control of Zaire's state-owned Gecamines.</p>
<p>One metals analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, echoed his note of caution on the pace of events in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all very well for a rebel government-in-waiting signing an agreement with an overseas mining company, but the reality is that we don't yet know who the government will be or what the government is going to look like,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some traders reckoned it might be a decade before the full impact of new foreign investment in Zaire's mining industries, starved of funds under Mobutu, is felt.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s cobalt production was around 15,000 tonnes, versus current levels around 5,000 - although this is still about one-fifth of global production.</p>
<p>Traders said state-owned Gecamines continues to hold the key to short-term supply and any impact on prices. Opinions vary on Gecamines present state of play.</p>
<p>Several market sources suggest that Gecamines is still producing and exporting cobalt.</p>
<p>On Monday the chief executive officer of Belgium's Union Miniere Karel Vinck, said supplies from Zaire were still flowing. Vinck said that rail transport routes through South Africa were still running.</p>
<p>Some trade sources say they are sceptical and that Gecamines were not selling on the spot or forward market. &quot;Even if they are producing, no material is flowing from the region,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The halt of shipments of cobalt from the U.S. Stockpile until at least April 28 following the issue of a temporary restraining offer was another main focus of attention.</p>
<p>Traders said the lack of material from the stockpile was helping to move prices higher. Other supporting factors included Japanese consumer demand and a lack of spot metal from western producers. Major producer Zambia was also believed to be running low stocks after recently hitting a low ore body.</p>
<p>Traders noted news that Russian produce Norilsk forecast 1997 cobalt production at 1,700 tonnes, versus 1,500 tonnes in 1996.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, antimony recent rally stalled and prices started to drift back under Chinese offers. European traders said that material was been shipped from China to Rotterdam. Recent consumer demand has slowed, they added.</p>
<p>Around 4,000 tonnes of Russian stockpiled magnesium is been offered to the market, European traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been asked to make a bid for the material...I believe other traders have also been approached,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>He said there could be another 10,000 tonnes of metal available from the Russian stockpile.</p>
<p>Japanese demand held indium above $300 a kilo, while they also showed buying interest in gallium. Germanium softened slightly but was finding consumer buying.</p>
<p>Bismuth after months in the doldrums found some enquiry as stocks were worked off.</p>
