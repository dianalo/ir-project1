<p>Singapore middle distillate prices were steady on Monday in a dull physical market with sellers indicating at higher levels while buyers took cover, traders said.</p>
<p>The swaps market however was relatively more active, making some gains earlier in the day but slipped off slightly later in the day, shaving off some of its earlier rise.</p>
<p>Swaps July deals were seen at $22.25, $22.35, $22.40 and $22.48 per barrel.</p>
<p>They said the higher levels were prompted by firmer gas oil and crude futures on London's International Petroleum Exchange.  </p>
<p>This encouraged physical cargo sellers to offer at more than $22.00 per barrel, with July 8-12 offered at $22.25 and at a 40-cent discount to Singapore spot quotes.</p>
<p>A cargo for July 11-15 lifting was seen at a 30-cent discount, free-on-board basis. Traders said none of the offers attracted any buyers who would only be interested to buy at below $22.00, as seen from the three cargoes bought last week at between $21.45 and $21.60.  </p>
<p>Initial excitement over possible demand from the Philippines amid the shutdown of a 15,000-barrel-per-day thermal cracker following an explosion on Friday, fizzled off when Petron said that they have ample buffer stocks and would not import.</p>
<p>The jet fuel/gas oil spread widened amid firmer jet values with swaps for July trading at $1.63 per barrel.</p>
<p>Traders said physical prices have widened to around $2.00 with July 8-12 offered at $24.00 and July 19-23 offered at $24.20.  </p>
<p>Traders said the confidence in the jet fuel market was attributed to demand from Indonesia, now estimated at as high as three million barrels for July, more than double their normal monthly purchases.</p>
