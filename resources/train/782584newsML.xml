<p>The economy grew moderately in mid-summer with several regions reporting more robust activity, but there were few signs of rising prices or wage pressures, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic activity generally expanded at a moderate rate in many districts in June and July, although several reported that growth was more brisk,&quot; the central bank said in its periodic summary of economic activity.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices for most goods were stable, although reports indicated that lumber and some agricultural prices rose,&quot; the report, known as the Beige Book, said.</p>
<p>The report, compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was likely to bolster the widespread belief among investors that Fed policy-makers will hold interest rates steady when they meet on Aug. 19.</p>
<p>The Fed raised short-term rates in March in a bid to ward off inflation, the first increase in more than two years, but has held them steady since. A survey of 33 economists by Reuters this week found that none expect the Fed to raise rates at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The Fed said prices were stable overall and were being held in check by &quot;competitive pressures&quot; in much of the country, though several regions said prices were rising for agricultural and energy products.</p>
<p>The central bank said labour markets had tightened further, with reported shortages of skilled workers, but &quot;subdued&quot; wage pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the persistent labour market tightness, wage pressures remained generally subdued,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Investors were rattled by a government report last Friday that unemployment fell to 4.8 percent in July, its lowest level in nearly 25 years, raising concerns about inflation.</p>
<p>But separate government reports show wholesale prices have fallen for a record six months, while consumer prices so far this year have risen at the slowest pace since 1986.</p>
<p>While consumer spending picked up in the June-July period, helped by summer weather, automobile sales were &quot;slightly softer&quot;, the Fed said.</p>
<p>&quot;Manufacturing remained at a high level or expanded further across most industries, particularly for nonautomotive durables,&quot; it said. But most manufacturers said their inventories were at &quot;generally desirable levels.&quot;</p>
