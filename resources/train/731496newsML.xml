<headline>YACHTING-GROUP 4 WINS &quot;WRONG WAY&quot; ROUND-WORLD YACHT RACE.</headline>
<dateline>SOUTHAMPTON, England 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>Group 4 won the Global Challenge yacht race on Wednesday, beating its closest rival by an hour after sailing &quot;the wrong way&quot; around the world.</p>
<p>Skipper Mike Golding and his crew of 13 volunteers have dominated the race since the fleet of 14 identical steel yachts left Southampton last September to sail around the globe against the prevailing winds and tides.</p>
<p>Group 4, sponsored by the British security firm of that name, won five of the race's six legs.</p>
<p>&quot;We were in this to win,&quot; Golding said after docking in the early hours of Wednesday. &quot;We never contemplated any other result from the very beginning. It's all about teamwork, and the crew have been superb.&quot;</p>
<p>All 196 crew on the boats were volunteers, many of whom had little or no sailing experience. The race was sponsored by British Telecommunications Plc.</p>
