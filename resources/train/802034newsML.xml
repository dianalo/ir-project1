<p>A further substantial drop of the Czech crown is still likely over the coming months as a large trade deficit weighs on investor sentiment, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Prague-based Patria Finance expects the crown to depreciate another five to 10 percent against the German mark in the medium term but said that exactly when the fall would happen was &quot;hard to predict&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The currency is still overvalued relative to fundamental variables,&quot; Patria economist Vladimir Kreidl told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This means we would have to see a substantial decline of the currency to get the trade and current account deficit to a position that will be sustainable over the long term.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the June trade deficit slowed to 9.6 billion crowns ($284.3 million) from 13.6 billion for the same month in 1996, boosted by the crown's sharp fall in April and May, Kreidl said the Czech unit must ease more to help correct the imbalances.</p>
<p>He added that events which may spark another speculative attack on the crown could be an autumn political battle over 1998 spending plans, or the approval of large deficits in next year's state and local budgets.</p>
<p>The crown eased by late afternoon on Friday to 18.54 to the mark from its 18.41 close on Thursday. Dealers said the crown was suffering from the uncertainty about emerging market currencies and volatility in the dollar and mark.</p>
<p>&quot;There's just general nervousness about emerging markets,&quot; said Petr Korous of Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.</p>
<p>According to a market source, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs recently predicted the crown would fall to 21.70 to the mark in the next three months. The U.S. investment bank's currency report, released on August 5, provided no comment beyond the forecast which was listed in a table.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs in London declined to release the report, which was intended only for the firm's clients, for broader publication.</p>
<p>Korous said a crown at 21 to the mark was an &quot;extremist&quot; view, but added that &quot;the fires are burning in Southeast Asia&quot; where emerging market currencies were under attack and &quot;these might come back to eastern Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that amid the volatility abroad, the crown showed signs of weakening beyond 18.6 to the mark by next week.</p>
<p>Some economists said a further sharp fall in the crown was currently being held back by relatively high Czech interest rates which make crown-denominated paper and deposits attractive.</p>
