<p>Leading British and German stocks hit record highs in early European trading on Monday, boosted by Wall Street's strong close last week as the U.S. market celebrated positive inflation data.</p>
<p>By 0900 GMT the Frankfurt's DAX index nearly one percent, or more than 20 points, above its previous peak, set on Friday. Dealers said gains were underpinned by the firmer dollar -- which makes German exports more attractive.</p>
<p>London stocks were also a few points higher than their Friday record high but down slightly from their opening.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all looking pretty favourable -- the Dow at a record on Friday, U.S. Treasuries firm and little on the corporate side to upset the applecart. We should put on 20 points with ease today,&quot; said London dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said London FTSE 100 index was likely to break above 4,000 points this week but they were sceptical the psychological level could be passed on Monday, despite talk that investment funds were poised to pump more liquidity into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we would have to wait for more significant corporate news before that comes. Volumes weren't that exciting on Friday. Also, there are some suspicions about whether Wall Street can hold those gains,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>On Friday the Dow Jones Average closed 1.15 percent higher at a record 5,838.52 as treasuries powered ahead.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse was mixed, trading down marginally at the start but later recovering following its 3.77 percent gain last week. Traders said the market may be pausing for breath amid profit-taking.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange markets the dollar was steady around Friday's closing levels in early European trading with little in prospect likely to stir the market up.</p>
<p>With Tokyo out overnight for a market holiday, early volume was light and traders reckoned there was a good chance the dollar could give up some of its recent gains during the course of the week.</p>
<p>Support lent by the Iraq crisis was fading, they said, and the view was growing that U.S. interest rates would be left unchanged at the September 24 Federal Open Markets Committee meeting.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT the dollar was slightly weaker against the mark than Friday's close but up slightly against the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is likely to struggle this week to hold onto its recent gains,&quot; said Klaus Baader, currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;Most importantly, interest rate support is waning.&quot; CURRENCIES AT 0900 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5110 marks and 110.45 yen compared with late Friday's 1.5112 marks and 110.32 yen.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0900 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 8.7 at 3,976.6.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 3.23 points at 2,083.60.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was up 25.09 points at 2,621.07.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was quoted easier at $382.70 compared with Friday's London close of $383.10. Silver was also weaker at $5.05.</p>
