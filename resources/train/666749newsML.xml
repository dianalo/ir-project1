<p>China is looking for large amounts of oil from Iraq but will move ahead cautiously with a $1.2 billion project and avoid conflict with United Nations sanctions, a Chinese oil official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a small amount of oil that we are looking for,&quot; said Zhou Bingyuan, senior economist at China National Petroleum Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;This is likely to be for millions of barrels of oil,&quot; he told Reuters at an oil industry conference.</p>
<p>However, he said the pace of the project would depend on the international stance toward Iraq, which has been under U.N. sanctions since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>&quot;This depends on the international situation,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not act against United Nations stipulations.&quot;</p>
<p>China National Petroleum Corp, the state-run company for onshore oil exploration and production, earlier this month signed an agreement to help develop the Ahdab oilfield in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed has said the field would eventually produce 90,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p>The United Nations imposed a blanket ban on export investment in Iraq but has since allowed the Mideast nation to pump $2.0 billion worth of oil over six months to pay for humanitarian goods.</p>
<p>Zhou said the development deal had been under study for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been thinking of this for a long time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zhou said China, once a net oil exporter, was unable to meet its growing domestic demand for oil and would have to look elsewhere for energy sources.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't do this by ourselves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chinese officials have estimated that crude oil imports could reach 50 million tonnes by the year 2000, compared with an expected 33 million tonnes this year and 22.6 million last year.</p>
<p>China National Petroleum's deal with Iraq was part of a string of overseas projects announced in recent weeks and aimed at securing long-term sources of oil.</p>
<p>The company reached an accord with Iran to explore for oil and natural gas in that country and it teamed up with Agip SpA of Italy to cooperate in world energy exploration and production.</p>
<p>It has also reached a $3.5 billion pact with Kazakhstan for a 3,000-km (1,860 mile) pipeline to China's far western region of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>However, Zhou said many details of the Kazakhstan contract remained to be determined, including where the pipeline would be placed.</p>
