<p>The Polish government will start on Tuesday debating a 1997 budget draft, which aims at a deficit of 2.6 percent of gross domestic product and a real rise in revenues and spending, the government spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Aleksandra Jakubowska told a news conference the government, which has until the end of October to submit its draft to parliament, was likely to continue discussions at an extra session later in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I know, the budget deficit has been set at 2.6 percent of GDP...and real revenues are to grow by 8.3 percent, while spending by 8.6 percent,&quot; Jakubowska said. This year's budget gap is set at 2.8 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The government approved in July the deficit target during its debate on the general budget outline.</p>
<p>But it received only last week the detailed finance ministry draft of the bill, and some analysts speculated the final budget bill proposal might assume a bigger shortfall to make room for higher spending in the election year.</p>
<p>Jakubowska also said under the draft the ratio of the budget's revenues to GDP would increase to no more than 27.9 percent from this year's 27.6 percent.</p>
<p>The spending to GDP ratio would fall to 29.5 percent from 30.4 percent this year.</p>
<p>Jakubowska confirmed the government priorities in the budget draft would include real wage increase for public sector workers and pensioners and higher spending for eductation, science, culture, agriculture and construction.</p>
