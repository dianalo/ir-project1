<p>Exports of manufactured goods are projected to rise by 8.2 percent to 171.4 billion ringgit in 1997 after slowing down markedly the previous year, Bank Negara Malaysia said on Friday in its 1996 annual report.</p>
<p>The central bank said an annual survey it conducted last year indicated that most companies projected export sales to increase this year.</p>
<p>It said Malaysian exporters were optimistic due to the favourable economic outlook for the major industrial countries and signs of recovery in the electronics industry.</p>
<p>Bank Negara also said that &quot;lumpy&quot; imports -- large one-off purchases -- are expected to increase to 6.6 billion ringgit this year, up from 4.7 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The bulk of these lumpy imports would consist mainly of imports of aircraft and ships by the national airline and shipping companies,&quot; the Bank said.</p>
<p>Gross imports growth is expected to increase by 8.6 percent this year, following a marginal increase in 1996.  </p>
<p>Imports of investment goods are expected to accelerate to 13.7 percent from a 1.2 percent decline last year, due to higher investment activity especially in the manufacturing and services sector.</p>
<p>Imports of intermediate goods are expected to increase by 4.9 percent due to strong manufacturing output. Imports of electronic component parts, which account for about 49 percent of total intermediate imports, are expected to increase by 9.5 percent.</p>
