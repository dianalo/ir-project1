<title>JAPAN: Key cash JGB yield rises after strong output data.</title>
<headline>Key cash JGB yield rises after strong output data.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-10-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 182nd Japanese government bond rose on Tuesday after September industrial output data came in toward the higher end of the market's expectations.</p>
<p>A trust bank trader said he felt the strong forecasts for manufacturers' output in October, and the prediction of only a minor month-on-month drop off in November, also confirmed that the economy was still recovering.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 182nd JGB stood at 2.640 percent as of 0702 GMT, up from the previous day's 2.610 percent  </p>
<p>Industrial production in September increased a preliminary 1.0 percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' output is seen increasing by 4.0 percent in October month on month on a seasonally adjusted basis, while it is seen dropping by 1.9 percent in November month on month.</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon, the yield of the benchmark 182nd JGB fell to 2.590 percent, the lowest since December 12, 1995. A trader for a city bank's securities affiliate said buying of cash JGBs by investors fuelled the fall in the benchmark yield.  </p>
<p>The trader said foreign financial institutions and local city banks were detected buying the 184th and 190th 10-year JGBs.</p>
<p>The brief fall in the benchmark JGB yield was due probably to dealers' activity, based on speculation of strong demand for the six-year JGBs offered via the Finance Ministry's auction, a trader for a long-term credit bank's securities affiliate said.</p>
<p>MOF offered 500 billion yen worth of 2.0 percent six-year JGBs through a price-competitive auction on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The lowest price of the JGBs was 100.20, while the average price was 100.21, MOF said.  </p>
<p>Traders said there had been talk in the market that the New Financial Stabilisation Fund, which was set up as part of a government scheme to solve the financial problems of failed mortgage companies, would buy the new six-year JGBs.</p>
<p>The first trader said such purchases were not actually detected, however.</p>
<p>&quot;If the coupon rate had been set at 1.9 percent they probably would have been able to pick them up at under par. They have a rule saying they can't go after over-par bonds. When the bonds were offered with a two percent coupon rate, they seem to have decided not to pursue the bonds,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Key December JGB futures ended at 124.50, down from 124.74 on Monday. Turnover was 52,196 contracts.</p>
<p>A trader for a trust bank's securities affiliate said the December's fall was due to position-adjustment sales ahead of the release of industrial output data.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said on Tuesday: &quot;There is no need to formulate a large supplementary budget which includes investment in public works.&quot;</p>
<p>The third trader said the market will not view reports of a possible extra budget as a sell factor until more specific details are given.-- Masayuki Kitano, Tokyo Treasury Desk.</p>
