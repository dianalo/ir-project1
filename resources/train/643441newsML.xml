<p>European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said on Friday European monetary union would go ahead on time.</p>
<p>&quot;The euro will see the day on January 1,1999&quot;, de Silguy said in an interview on France Info radio.  </p>
<p>De Silguy repeated that the decision on which countries would participate in the European single currency will be taken by the member states at the end of April or the beginning of May in 1998.</p>
<p>Asked whether the change of government in France had produced a shift in European policy, de Silguy said the new Socialist Prime Minister has said the scheduled start date of January 1, 1999 would be respected.</p>
<p>De Silguy said there was agreement on the aim of how to create a single currency which was both &quot;stable&quot; and &quot;credible&quot; and &quot;to have in the euro the as many member states as are able to participate.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked how French negotiations would be conducted when the President and the Prime Minister belonged to different political parties, known as a &quot;cohabitation&quot;, De Silguy said, &quot;France always speaks with a single voice...in general, in other cohabitations there has been a French delegation led by the President of the Republic.&quot;</p>
