<p>New Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered Pakistan's return to the weekend holiday on Sunday instead of Friday after more than 20 years.</p>
<p>He announced the switch on Sunday in his first televised address to the nation a week after taking office following his Pakistan Muslim League party's landslide victory in elections on February 3.</p>
<p>Friday was made the Islamic weekend in Pakistan in the 1970s by then prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in an attempt to appease Islamic clergy.</p>
<p>Sharif said the holiday on Friday had been mostly used for social occasions rather than for Islamic prayers.</p>
<p>&quot;To give Friday its due status and to restore its sanctity, we have decided to have holiday on Sunday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he said offices would close at midday on Friday so people could go to mosques for the traditional Islamic congregations.</p>
