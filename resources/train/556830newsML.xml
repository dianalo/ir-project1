<p>Brady bond market players continued to seek direction from the U.S. Treasuries in light trade on Friday ahead of the release of key U.S. data, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately it is another quiet session,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;Activity is low as a lot of players have taken a long weekend after the May Day holidays in many countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are still holding firm following the rally in U.S. Treasuries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A surge of late New York buying inspired by the strength in U.S. Treasuries lifted prices of emerging market bonds. Since Monday, the yield on the U.S. long bond has rallied from 7.14 percent to 6.92 percent.</p>
<p>ANZ said the most aggressive tightening had come from Venezuela, where the Par sovereign spread slipped to 590 b.p. from 660 b.p.</p>
<p>It said Ecuador Pars and Bulgaria IABs had also outstripped the market.</p>
<p>Another dealer said: &quot;Until we have a clearer view of what's happening in the U.S. Treasury market, we won't be looking at the fundamentals in the emerging market countries, but at what yields are doing.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. April employment data is scheduled for release at 830 EDT/1230 GMT. Analysts, on average, expect a rise of 211,000 in the non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate holding steady at 5.2 percent.</p>
<p>Russia was well-bid, some dealers said, with the $-Vnesh up 3/8 at 81-3/8 bid.</p>
