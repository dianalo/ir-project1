<text>
<p>A year after launching its bid for the Forte hotel and catering empire, Granada Group Plc gets good marks from analysts reviewing its progress.</p>
<p>&quot;They are in line for a very strong performance this year. The figures seem to back them up on what they said during the Forte battle,&quot; said Ron Littleboy of Nomura Securities.</p>
<p>Granada, which completed the 3.9 billion stg takeover of Forte in January, posted pre-tax, pre-exceptional profit of 480 million stg in the year to end-September, a 37 percent rise.</p>
<p>Granada said it had made a 40 million stg profit improvement at Forte and was on target for its forecast 100 million uplift.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Forte improvement was the main reason why they were ahead of most forecasts. Most people were expecting an improvement of 20-25 million stg,&quot; Littleboy added.</p>
<p>Littleboy is forecasting 1996/97 full-year profit of 660 million stg and earnings per share of 52.5p.</p>
<p>Greg Feehely of Kleinwort Benson Securities said he thought the figures were very solid and he was surprised at the lacklustre market reaction. Granada shares stood 7-1/2p lower at 885p at 1405 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Granada is a cheap stock on fundamentals and backed by good management,&quot; Feehely said.  </p>
<p>Feehely said he was impressed by the smoothness of the Forte acquisition, which did not appear to carry any hidden costs.</p>
<p>Granada said the deal had cost it 74 million stg, 1.8 percent of the consideration but added that the figure was a one-off with no further charges in the next year. It said it had made 585 staff redundant since the takeover.</p>
<p>Granada made food purchasing savings worth 11.2 million stg in its restaurants division in the eight months after the acquisition. It said it expected to beat its original target of 20 million stg in savings in the year to September 1997.</p>
<p>It said it had delivered on its acquisition plans in Hotels.  </p>
<p>It said staff levels had been reduced, a new pricing strategy introduced and brands simplified to three core ones.</p>
<p>Profit before interest and tax from the Restaurants division totalled 217 million stg, an increase of 80 percent. Turnover from the unit grew by 61 percent to 1.7 billion thanks to the impact of the roadside restaurants acquired from Forte.</p>
<p>Profit from Hotels was 168 million stg on 814 million turnover while Media boosted profits 17 percent to 163 million stg on turnover which was up seven percent at 600 million.</p>
<p>Rental turnover was little changed at 700 million stg and profit marginally higher at 126 million.  </p>
<p>Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers said he was likely to upgrade his 1996/1997 figures from his current pre-tax level of 641 million stg.</p>
<p>&quot;Granada have shown that they can drive up revenues and strip out costs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nigel Reed of Paribas, who is forecasting pre-tax profit of 705 million stg for the current year, said he was a little concerned about the potential impact of price rises.</p>
<p>&quot;They have done an excellent job so far on cost reductions and margin increases but I would sound a note of caution about the possible effect of price rises on volumes,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Much attention in the next few months will focus on the disposal of assets acquired in the Forte deal.</p>
<p>Granada hopes to complete the sale of the Exclusive hotels and separately of the Welcome Break UK motorway service areas by early 1997. Analysts expect the sale of the 17 Exclusives to raise a total of around 900 million stg.</p>
<p>Nomura's Littleboy said he believed brewing and leisure group Whitbread Plc will seek to acquire the 21 Welcome Breaks which Granada must sell because of monopoly concerns.</p>
<p>Whitbread had an agreement to buy them from Forte but this lapsed when the company was taken over. Littleboy said that their improved performance under Granada might mean that Whitbread would have to pay a premium to the 340 million stg book value.</p>
