<p>Continental Airlines Inc. opened talks on Wednesday on a new labour pact with its pilots union, which is seeking a steep boost in wages and other benefits from the nation's fifth-largest airline.</p>
<p>The Houston-based carrier and the union representing its 5,000 pilots also pledged to avoid bitter disputes over the use of regional jets that stalled talks between rival American Airlines and its pilots earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike the pilots at American Airlines we do not propose to interfere with the company's ability to utilize 50-seat regional jets under the Continental Express certificate,&quot; Len Nikolai, president of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots, said in a letter to the company.</p>
<p>The union, which represents 4,000 Continental pilots and 1,000 pilots at sister regional airline Continental Express, expects to forge terms of new labour pacts with the company by June 30, when the larger carrier's contract expires.</p>
<p>In proposals presented during a breakfast meeting with the carrier's chief negotiators, the Continental pilots sought improved wages, an &quot;industry standard&quot; retirement plan and work concessions.</p>
<p>Nikolai told reporters he saw little possibility of a strike on the horizon. &quot;A strike for us is remote. We don't have any interest, we don't have any plans in a work stoppage at our carrier,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Continental pilots average $92,000 a year in taxable wages, well below the $150,000 paid to pilots at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, and $130,000 paid to US Airways Group Inc. pilots, union negotiators said.</p>
<p>&quot;By the close of these negotiations, our pilots must have industry-standard compensation; that is, pay and benefits comparable to those earned by pilots at the other leading carriers,&quot; Nikolai said in the letter to Continental Chief Executive Officer Gordon Bethune.</p>
<p>Bethune, who is widely credited with boosting morale of Continental's workers, earlier said he would ensure a fair seniority system was in place for the pilots in the event of a merger, Nikolai said.</p>
<p>In separate talks, Continental Express pilots are seeking a raise from an average $13,000 annual starting salary along with a pension plan, scheduling changes and job security in the event of a merger.</p>
<p>Continental emerged from bankruptcy in 1992 and is now recognised as one of the strongest domestic carriers, posting record earnings of $319 million on revenues of $6.4 billion last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This airline, which we all worked so hard to save from bankruptcy, is now one of the top performing airlines in the world,&quot; Nikolai told reporters. &quot;Let's be blunt. Continental's pilots flew it out of bankruptcy.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately, Spain's Iberia, which own 10 percent of Aerolineas Argentinas, said American and Continental were interested in buying a stake in the Argentinian carrier and could own a 20 percent share in the next two months.</p>
<p>Iberia sources said, however, that the Spanish airline would not sell its own stake. Continental or American may buy the stake from Aerolineas' major shareholder Andes Holdings, which currently holds a 63 percent stake.</p>
<p>&quot;We should know in the next 10 to 15 days which airline has succeeded in securing the stake,&quot; said one source.</p>
<p>Continental's class A stock edged up 12.5 cents to $31.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.</p>
