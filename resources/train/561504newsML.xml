<p>Greek shares extended their winning streak on Monday, piercing resistance at 1,500 in active trading with banks and industrial heavyweights climbing strongly.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index settled 2.25 percent or 33.45 points higher at 1,518.42, a new year high, from Friday's close of 1,484.97.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market is headed for further highs in the future and saw little chance of a downturn.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not anticipate a correction to the rally because we witness very strong buying interest for blue chips that dwarfs all profit-taking moves,&quot; said Evangelos Haratsis, director at Beta Securities.</p>
<p>The rise in banks was based on portfolio gains and strong demand for their rights issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks monopolise investor interest because they are tapping the market with large capital increases and produce windfall gains on their bond portfolios from sharp interest rate cuts,&quot; said Haratsis.</p>
<p>Other sectors, including construction, appeared much cheaper at current price levels and should be expected to yield high returns in the future, Haratsis said.</p>
<p>The benchmark index opened with a 10-point jolt at 1,494.60 and immediately pierced through the 1,500 level, reaching a day high of 1,520.20 towards the end of the session.</p>
<p>Banks rose 2.24 percent and industrials were led 1.55 percent higher by a good performance in food stocks. Small-caps bucked the trend, registering a 0.76 percent drop.</p>
<p>Turnover grew further to 21.9 billion drachmas despite the bank holiday in London, proving the point made by market participants in recent sessions that the ongoing rally was mostly attributed to domestic investors.</p>
<p>There were block trades in Ergobank and Lavipharm .</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners 168 to 75 with 17 stocks unchanged on 260 traded.</p>
