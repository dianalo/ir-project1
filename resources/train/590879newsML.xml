<p>CSCE cocoa futures were called to open little changed Friday, with opinions mixed on the market's direction after Thursday's sharp upswing.</p>
<p>While some traders said the market was due for a technical correction, others said yesterday's strong close could inspire follow-through buying.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment is friendly, but cautious,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I still think you might see people selling the rallies.&quot;</p>
<p>Thursday, New York cocoa futures jumped to six-week highs, boosted by chart-driven speculative buying. July cocoa ended up $59 at $1,481 a tonne after trading from $1,483 to $1,423. Second-month September closed $54 higher at $1,507, while the remaining months gained $53 to $57.</p>
<p>Traders said cocoa prices recieved a boost from talk that the upcoming 1997/98 Ivorian main crop could be delayed due drought conditions earlier this year, which has kept soil moisture below optimum levels.</p>
<p>Concerns about the quality of the Ivory Coast mid-crop added fuel to the rally, they said. And weather patterns suggesting dry weather could hit Brazil and Africa were also viewed as friendly.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said July resistance was a chart gap formed last month between $1,494 and $1,501. On the downside, support was seen at $1,465, with a key support level noted at $1,445 to $1,441.</p>
<p>In London, cocoa futures were higher early Friday, bolstered by fund buying. LIFFE July cocoa was up 11 stg at the midday break, to 1,029 stg, after ranging from 1,032 to 1,023 stg. Sepember was up 13 stg, to 1,049 stg. ((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodity Desk 212 859 1640))</p>
