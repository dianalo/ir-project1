<p>Five people including three children were killed and 12 wounded on Tuesday in clashes between rival factions in southern Mogadishu where mortar bombs slammed into civilian areas.</p>
<p>More than 20 mortar bombs fired by both sides crashed into a residential area near Mogadishu's former military hospital.</p>
<p>Witnesses said three children were killed when a 120 mm mortar bomb hit their home. Seven wounded from the area were brought to the Hassan Jiis Memorial Hospital, a doctor said.</p>
<p>A militia officer said two civilians were killed and five wounded when an artillery shell exploded in Medina district.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the fighting pitted militiamen loyal to Ali Hassan Osman Atto against forces of Hussein Aideed, a 34-year-old former U.S. marine who succeeded his powerful father when he died on August 1.</p>
<p>Atto's and Aideed's forces have fought repeatedly despite Somali factions -- including both leaders -- agreeing in Nairobi last month to end hostilities and remove all roadblocks in the capital.</p>
<p>The talks were mediated by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi. A total of 22 factions including Aideed's have been invited to a new reconciliation conference in the southeastern Somalian port of Bosaso on December 1.</p>
<p>South Mogadishu has been hit since September by a string of assassinations, attacks and counter-attacks which Somali experts say are part of a vendetta between the two groups over the death of Hussein Aideed's father, 62-year-old Mohamed Farah Aideed.</p>
<p>In Addis Ababa on Monday, witnesses said Somali faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed had arrived in the Ethiopian capital and diplomats speculated he was there for possible Somali peace talks.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they saw Ali Mahdi with some officials of his north Mogadishu-based clan alliance in an Addis Ababa state-run hotel where visiting African leaders usually stay.</p>
<p>Diplomats and official sources said he might have come to Addis Ababa for an informal exchange of views with Ethiopian government officials on how to restore peace to Somalia.</p>
<p>They said Ethiopia in September called for talks with Somali faction leaders to explore the possibilities of bringing peace to Somalia, torn apart by civil war since the fall of late dictator and president Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.</p>
<p>They said several prominent Somalis had visited Addis Ababa since September including Osman Atto, an ally of Ali Mahdi, and a representative of both men's arch-enemy Hussein Aideed.</p>
