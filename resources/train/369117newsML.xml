<p>A scramble for Russian shares by tense investors is sending the bull market charging again, even though it has already risen 50 percent this year, and traders say they cannot predict when it will pause for breath.</p>
<p>An outburst of activity which began on Monday after a two-week pause propelled the Russian Trading System (RTS) index to a record 312.60 on Tuesday, up from 304.90 on Monday and under 200 at the end of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it,&quot; said Peter Kizenko, head of equities trading at ING Barings in Moscow, adding that investor funds were chasing a limited number of shares. &quot;Stock appears -- stock gets taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Second-tier utilities and telecoms led the field along with a few leading liquid shares, such as national utility Unified Energy System (UES)  EESR.RTS, which broke through 20 cents, closing at $0.2020, off an early $0.2200 and $0.1955 on Monday.</p>
<p>It was $0.082 at the beginning of December.</p>
<p>Chelyabenergo  CHNG.RTS jumped to $0.450 from $0.411 on February 6, the previous date of trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The orders are not as price-sensitive these days,&quot; Kizenko said. &quot;That shows a different kind of money.&quot;</p>
<p>Trade volumes, which were $50 million on Tuesday, have not jumped significantly. But traders said the market had been frenzied as investors who had hoped for better buying opportunities in a correction began actively acquiring shares.</p>
<p>Some said the rally was already losing steam, pointing to swings in afternoon trade, although the RTS index firmed throughout the day.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot understand why anyone should buy Rostelekom RTKM.RTS at four dollars, and UES at 21 cents,&quot; said Creditanstalt-Grant chief trader Andrei Galperin.</p>
<p>Rostelekom ticked down to $4.000 from $4.065.</p>
<p>Domestic investors were seen stimulating the move. They include commercial banks moving from the Treasury bill market where many yields, unadjusted for inflation, have fallen to under 30 percent from almost 200 early last year.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund's decision to release $650 million in delayed funds to Russia on Friday and Russia's recent inclusion on the International Finance Corporation index had also helped, traders said.</p>
<p>Worries about President Boris Yeltsin's health have receded.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to take a significant political event to take down this market,&quot; said James Fenkner, head of research at CentreInvest Securities. &quot;There is just too much momentum and sourcing of shares is difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>Technical analysis which had predicted the timing of the new rally also predicted it would last one to two weeks and would hit resistance when the RTS index neared 330, he said.</p>
<p>Other traders said the rally could last longer and did not expect a significant downturn, given limited liquidity and demand for shares in a seller's market.</p>
<p>Undervalued regional and second-tier shares were seen as the leading gainers in a new rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Telecoms, utilities and (national savings bank) Sberbank are all rising. Investors are taking everything that is undervalued,&quot; said Kirill Maltsev, institutional sales manager at Rye, Man and Gor Securities.</p>
<p>A group of about half a dozen relatively liquid shares led the early January rally on new allocations from foreign investors and funds from new investors. Now second-tiers stocks are leading the widely anticipated second rally.</p>
<p>But Maltsev said some experienced Russian investors were quietly taking profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Any normal person would expect a fall in his gut, but on the other hand, the end is not in sight.&quot;</p>
