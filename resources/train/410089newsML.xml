<p>President Boris Yeltsin, taking another step toward abolishing the death penalty, ordered the Russian foreign ministry on Friday to sign the article of the global human rights convention outlawing capital punishment.</p>
<p>He simultaneously ordered the justice ministry to work out with other branches of the state an array of measures needed to put this into practice &quot;step by step&quot;, according to the text of the order issued by the Kremlin press service.</p>
<p>It set no timetable for the abolition of the death penalty, which last year was carried out 53 times, Soviet-style, with a single shot to the back of the head of the prisoner.</p>
<p>A justice ministry official told Reuters the signing of Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention did not mean immediate reprieve for the 500 or so currently on death row after Yeltsin's new Kremlin team began an informal moratorium last August.</p>
<p>&quot;Before abolishing the death penalty, parliament has to change the law, in particular the new criminal code which came into effect on January 1. This reduced the number of capital crimes from about 30 to five,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yeltsin's order may mean that things will move a little faster&quot;, she added.</p>
<p>Russia undertook to get rid of capital punishment within three years when it joined the Council of Europe a year ago. But the move has been hotly contested by the interior ministry, which faces a mounting crime wave. The finance ministry is also unhappy about the prospective cost of maintaining prisoners on life sentences.</p>
<p>Anatoly Pristavkin, the respected writer who heads Yeltsin's Presidential Pardons Commission, told Itar-Tass news agency that Friday's order was in line with Russia's commitment to the Council of Europe and &quot;makes our state more lawful and defends the rights of citizens&quot;.</p>
<p>A tireless campaigner against the death penalty and appalling conditions in Russian prisons, Pristavkin warned, however, that pushing abolition through the opposition-dominated State Duma lower house of parliament would be very difficult.</p>
<p>Even some convicts, condemned to life sentences, petition to be shot rather than face incarceration in Russia's overcrowded city prisons and grim labour camps.</p>
<p>Pristavkin said: &quot;This law must absolutely be passed. Our country must give up murder as soon as possible, particularly since it has never been of benefit to society.&quot;</p>
