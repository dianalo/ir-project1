<title>UK: Black British MP apologises for nursing race row.</title>
<headline>Black British MP apologises for nursing race row.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-28</dateline>

<p>A British member of parliament apologised on Thursday for criticising the hospital in her constituency for hiring &quot;blonde, blue-eyed Finnish nurses.&quot;</p>
<p>Diane Abbott, a prominent black member of the opposition Labour party, said she was sorry and upset about the comment, interpreted as a racial slur, and the row that ensued.</p>
<p>&quot;I very much regret that one sentence of my article for a local paper has led to a widespread misunderstanding of my position,&quot; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;As a local MP I was emphasising the importance of recruiting locally. I am sorry and upset that what I said has been interpreted as a racist statement.&quot;</p>
<p>In a column in her local paper the left-wing MP said she was surprised that a hospital in her district hired from Finland, instead of recruiting Caribbean nurses who know the language and understood British culture and institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Are Finnish girls, who may never have met a black person before, let alone touched one, best suited to nurse in multicultural Hackney?&quot; she asked in her column. &quot;Black nurses are leaving the profession all the time because of racism.&quot;</p>
<p>The comments caused an uproar and several letters of complaint, including one from hospital officials detailing the staff shortages they faced.</p>
<p>Newspapers also criticised Abbott's &quot;hysterical tirade&quot; and described her as &quot;an extrovert with a huge chip on her shoulder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Imagine Diane Abbott's view reversed as in a photographic negative. It is difficult to exaggerate the offence such words would have provoked had they been expressed by a white woman in regard to black nurses,&quot; the Daily Mail said in an editorial.</p>
<p>A senior nurse at the London hospital said 30 nurses from Finland, where there is a surplus of nurses, had been hired to plug the gap and another 20 were due in 1997.</p>
<p>Staff nurse Satu Jaaskelainen, 25, said she was insulted by Abbott's comments. &quot;It has made me very, very, angry. I treat all my patients the same,&quot; she told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>Another nurse called Abbott's remarks ridiculous and said the most important thing was that nurses were competent.</p>
