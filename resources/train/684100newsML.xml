<p>Turkish police on Tuesday arrested the alleged mastermind of an Islamist armed attack four years ago against one of the country's leading Jewish businessmen, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>It said Turkish national Ahmet Burak had asked to be sent to Turkey after being seized trying to enter Pakistan from Iran without a passport. He arrived at Istanbul airport on Tuesday morning and was immediately arrested, the agency said.</p>
<p>Burak is alleged to have provided the weapons and organised an attempt to kill Jak Kamhi, chairman of the home appliance manufacturer Profilo Holding.</p>
<p>Gunmen shot at Kamhi's car with automatic weapons not far from his house in January, 1993, but then fled when Kamhi's police guards returned fire. Police found two assault rifles, two pistols, hand grenades and a anti-tank missile at the scene.</p>
<p>A court later sentenced three members of an illegal group, the Islamic Movement, to 15 years in jail for the attack.</p>
<p>The Kamhi attack took place days after a car bomb killed secularist journalist Ugur Mumcu. His killers are still being sought.</p>
<p>The attacks and other subsequent assassination attempts led to accusations by Turkish officials that Iran was aiding Islamist killings in Turkey. Tehran denies this.</p>
