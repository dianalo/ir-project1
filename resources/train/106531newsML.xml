<p>The precious metals market was sleepy and desperately seeking direction in early European trade on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's dead this morning. Gold is right in the middle of support at $380 and resistance at $382,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $380.90 an ounce, barely changed from Tuesday afternoon's $380.85 fixing.</p>
<p>&quot;The only positive sign is that gold is still above $380, which is an important psychological level,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>But market sentiment in gold was still mostly bearish after prices slid to 18-month lows last week within a month-old downtrend, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the medium term, if there is a big price move, it's going to be lower,&quot; with $375 as the first target, one said.</p>
<p>The gold market would be watching for September U.S. Producer Price Index data on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>But dealers said it was unlikely to affect prices unless the figures had a significant effect on other markets. Investors have been ignoring gold in light of benign U.S. inflation and booming stock and bond market.</p>
<p>Silver was even more somnolent than gold, just one cent lower at $4.89 an ounce. &quot;It doesn't seem that silver or the other metals are trading at all so far,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum was also little changed at $384.25, with little obvious scope to move out of its recent $383-$386 range. &quot;The platinum market is thin and lacklustre,&quot; an analyst said. The market was cautious of about platinum because key Japanese demand for the metal was slack and the volume of metal stocks held by important producer Russia was a mystery, he said.</p>
<p>However, platinum was due to for a move up after its recent drops to near 2-1/2 year lows, analysts said.</p>
<p>Palladium was unchanged at $118.25 an ounce and seen vulnerable to downside pressure after drifting below the key $120 support area again earlier this week.</p>
