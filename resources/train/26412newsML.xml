<p>Church bells will peal when the Philippines signs a pact with Moslem rebels on Monday ending a war that has killed more than 120,000 people, but analysts say economic growth will decide if it will bring real peace.</p>
<p>Government supporters will stage marches around the country and helicopters will shower Manila with confetti in official rejoicing when rebel chief Nur Misuari signs the accord signifying his loyalty to a government he once fought to secede from.</p>
<p>Completed over fierce Christian opposition, the agreement formally ends a 24-year revolt for Moslem self-rule on the main southern island of Mindanao and clears the way for the development of a poor region that is home to the country's five million Moslem minority.</p>
<p>Government negotiator Manuel Yan will co-sign the agreement in a ceremony at the Malacanang presidential palace to be witnessed by President Fidel Ramos, Islamic envoys and other diplomats.</p>
<p>But with Mindanao Christians bristling and other Moslem rebel factions left out of the deal, the accord could stir new unrest, some analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many obstacles, so many landmines, so many people opposed to it that it can be sabotaged and torpedoed,&quot; political analyst Teodoro Benigno said.</p>
<p>&quot;What will make the agreement succeed is the speed and scope of incoming investments. Without the investments it will blow up.&quot;</p>
<p>Failure by Manila to deliver on its promise to turn Mindanao into a growth area could boost the ranks of other guerrilla groups in the region fighting for an Islamic state, other analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is how to succeed in a short time, and that means bread and butter issues,&quot; said Moslem lawyer Macapanton Abbas.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody will expect to get a job but what if there is none, what if bureaucracy delays the release of funds? Then there will be disenchantment and that is the danger,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Christians oppose the accord because they fear it will lead to Moslem rule. Moslems regard Mindanao as their ancestral homeland although they are now outnumbered 3-to-1 by Christian settlers.</p>
<p>While churches in Manila will ring their bells on Monday to celebrate the accord, Christian residents will hold a symbolic funeral march in Zamboanga city in a show of protest.</p>
<p>The deal calls for the setting up of a Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) headed by Misuari to supervise development in 14 provinces, followed three years later by a plebiscite and regional autonomy.</p>
<p>It also provides for integration into the armed forces and police of 7,500 of the estimated 16,000 guerrillas of Misuari's Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). Livelihood programmes are to be launched for other rebels who cannot be absorbed into the army so they are not tempted to go back to the hills.</p>
<p>&quot;The transition will not be very clean. There will not be instant peace after the signing in the same way that you make instant coffee,&quot; University of the Philippines political science professor Alex Magno told Reuters.</p>
<p>But while there will be small bands of adventurers who will try to undermine the accord, Magno said he believed they would become marginalised once economic development took hold.</p>
<p>&quot;The signing ceremony...is an important signal for business which is looking at opportunities in Mindanao,&quot; the Philippines' front door to a future southeast Asian common market, he said.</p>
<p>Development &quot;is the real war that Ramos must win, the economic war,&quot; Magno added.</p>
