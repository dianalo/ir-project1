<p>Brazilian soybean producers, traders and crushers have all warmly applauded the Senate's Sept 12 decision to eliminate ICMS, a tax on exports and interstate trading of primary and semi-manufactured goods.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now entering a new soybean cycle,&quot; said Nelson Mamede, soybean commercial director for crusher Sadia.</p>
<p>&quot;Elimination of the tax should lead to higher soybean production and exports and a bigger crush next year,&quot; Mamede said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The crushers are very satisfied with the tax lifting. Our biggest cost today is our 30-40 percent spare crush capacity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The tax, to be eliminated with effect from mid-September, has been charged at a rate of 13 percent for soybeans, 11.1 percent for soymeal, and eight percent for soyoil.</p>
<p>The tax elimination should  benefit all involved in the Brazilian soyproducts chain. Soybean producers, for instance, should see a direct reduction in their sales costs.  </p>
<p>&quot;This should mean an increase in local producer prices, regardless of what is happening on the international market,&quot; said Paul Marie Oorts, analyst with Rio Grande do Sul state cooperatives federation Fecotrigo.</p>
<p>&quot;The big advantage in all this is for the farmers, who should now start to make profits,&quot; added Antonio Sartori of Rio Grande do Sul broker Brasoja.</p>
<p>The ICMS elimination, whose effect has been described as equivalent  to a seven percent devaluation of the real, should also benefit exporters by boosting the competitiveness abroad of all Brazilian soycomplex products.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for Brazilian Vegetable Oils Association Abiove said that following news of the ICMS lifting, &quot;prospects are the best possible for the coming planting season, although credit problems still exist for producers.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazil's soybean planting season should start in October. Trade estimates are that, weather permitting,  the country's 1996/97 soybean crop should grow five to ten percent over this year, to between 25.5 and 27 million tonnes.</p>
<p>If output grows, Brazil's exports of soybeans can be expected to grow to some 4.5 - 5 million tonnes in 1997, up from an estimated 3.5 million tonnes this year, said Sadia's Mamede.  </p>
<p>In addition, soymeal exports should grow to around 11 million tonnes, up from this year's expected 10 million tonnes, while soyoil exports stay roughly stable at 1.3 million tonnes, he said.</p>
<p>Government statistics show that so far this year Brazil has exported around eight million tonnes of soymeal and that 9.7 million tonnes have been registered for export.</p>
<p>&quot;This year Brazil's crushers will crush some 20 million tonnes of soybeans: this may rise next year to 21 million tonnes,&quot; Mamede said. &quot;But our nominal crushing capacity is 32 million tonnes,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Expectations that the ICMS tax would be imminently lifted have led to speculation on domestic market soybean prices, which have risen some 2 reais ($1.98) per 60-kilo bag over the past 20 or so days, the Sadia director said.</p>
<p>The existing negative crushing margin in Brazil has worsened during that time to 1.50 reais ($1.48) per bag, he said.</p>
<p>Traders reported that both domestic and export sales slowed down in recent weeks while the market was awaiting a definition of the ICMS tax issue.  </p>
<p>Trade indications are that even following the elimination of the ICMS tax, Brazilian domestic soybean prices can be expected to remain firm until the start of the US harvest in late September.</p>
<p>The national soybean price, a composite average, was put at $16.94 a 60-kilo bag on Sept 12, while crusher purchase prices of up to $18.22 a bag were reported in the west of Parana state and up to $18.50 in Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
