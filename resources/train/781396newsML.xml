<p>U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke returned to the Balkans on Wednesday to pile pressure on leaders in former Yugoslavia to abide by a landmark peace agreement he put together to end the Bosnian war.</p>
<p>Holbrooke was expected to display his customary tough diplomacy with the same politicians whom he bullied and cajoled into agreeing a peace settlement in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;He's coming here to read the riot act,&quot; said one Sarajevo diplomat.</p>
<p>Holbrooke, accompanied by the U.S. envoy to Bosnia, Robert Gelbard, met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the Moslem chairman of the Bosnian presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, in the Adriatric port of Split on the first day of his tour.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear to me from what ambassador Gelbard told me and from what I've observed, that progress is being made but at much too slow a pace,&quot; Holbrooke told Reuters in Split.</p>
<p>&quot;We're here to encapsulate what has happened and try to accelerate the process and keep it moving forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats said Holbrooke would make clear to Tudjman in particular that he had to ensure his Bosnian Croat proteges lived up to agreements to strengthen the troubled Moslem-Croat federation, which covers half of Bosnia.</p>
<p>It was Holbrooke's first visit to the region since last year, when he negotiated a deal that forced wartime Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic to step down from office.</p>
<p>Under the agreement which was signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Karadzic -- an indicted war criminal -- pledged to stay out of the political arena.</p>
<p>One year later, Karadzic continues to wield power covertly and his allies have sought to undermine the Dayton accords which divided Bosnia into autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat territorities ruled by a small central government.</p>
<p>But Serb hardliners loyal to Karadzic have blocked the return of Moslem and Croat refugees and tried to portray their autonomous territory as an independent state.</p>
<p>During his visit, Holbrooke planned to promote Karadzic's rival, Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, who has been locked in a bitter power struggle with Karadzic.</p>
<p>Holbrooke was scheduled to fly from Croatia to Banja Luka on Thursday morning to hold talks with Plavsic.</p>
<p>Although an ultra-nationalist herself, Plavsic has won Western support in her battle with Karadzic, whom she has accused of running vast smuggling rackets.</p>
<p>Balkan analysts said Holbrooke would pledge U.S. support for general elections which Plavsic called after dissolving the parliament in Bosnia's Serb republic.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Holbrooke would probably push Milosevic, the patron of the Bosnian Serbs, to throw his support behind Plavsic and stop propping up hardliners loyal to Karadzic and threaten him with sanctions unless he abided by his Dayton comitments.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all right there on the table -- both economic incentives if Milosevic cooperates, or sanctions. It's up to him to make a choice,&quot; one diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>The issue that was expected to dominate Holbrooke's meetings was the prosecution of indicted war criminals, including Karadzic, who remain at large.</p>
<p>Croatia and Yugoslavia have tried to avoid their obligations under the Dayton treaty to hand over suspects wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal.</p>
<p>British soldiers in the NATO-led peace force arrested one suspect and shot dead another who opened fire last month in an unprecedented operation in the Serb-controlled Prijedor region.</p>
<p>The arrest operation sparked off a wave of retaliatory bombings against NATO and international monitors but the low-level violence has tapered off over the past week.</p>
<p>Some commentators speculated that Holbrooke might deliver an ultimatum, warning that NATO would go after more suspects if authorities failed to turn them over.</p>
<p>On the eve of Holbrooke's trip, American officials launched a broadside against the work of the international High Representative to Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, who oversees civilian aspects of the treaty.</p>
