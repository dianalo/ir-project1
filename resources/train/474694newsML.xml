<p>Rhode Island investigators looking at when and how young children eat cigarettes and cigarette butts have found that three-fourths of the cases involve 6-to-12-month-old toddlers.</p>
<p>The nicotine in an eaten cigarette can have serious effects on a child. If the dose is high enough, it can slow respiration, create an irregular heartbeat and lead to convulsions, according to the study in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>
<p>As they get older, preschoolers seem less likely to swallow a smoke, it said.</p>
<p>Rhode Island's Poison Control Center logged 146 cases in the state from January 1994 to July 1996 where a child under six ate a product containing nicotine. The number of cases reported nationwide in 1995 was 7,917.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't happen very often by our statistics but we're probably only seeing the tip of the iceberg,&quot; Dr. William Lewander, director of pediatric emergency medicine at Rhode Island Hospital and the chief author of the study, said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of children may ingest (cigarettes or cigarette butts) and nobody calls the poison control center because the child has no symptoms, or they may call a pediatrician,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Of the 90 Rhode Island cases studied in detail, only a third of the children had symptoms, including vomiting, nausea, and gagging. All recovered within 12 hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents, grandparents and other caretakers don't realize the problem because, to them, a cigarette butt is a spent product,&quot; said Lewander. &quot;But even when the cigarette is out there's still a risk.&quot;</p>
<p>The researchers found that most of the cases were reported in homes where people smoked in front of the child. &quot;They don't see you eating (the cigarette) but they see you putting it in your mouth. That's like eating it to them,&quot; Lewander said.</p>
