<p>Bank Austria's bid to buy rival Creditanstalt took on a political hue on Friday as conservatives in the coalition government voiced opposition and Creditanstalt workers turned out in force to protest.</p>
<p>Around 3,000 of the bank's 8,000-strong domestic workforce crowded into the marble cash hall of Creditanstalt's elegant Vienna headquarters to urge the government to protect their jobs and reject Bank Austria's bid for the state's stake.</p>
<p>Waving flyers that read: &quot;This is my bank&quot;, they unanimously passed a resolution slamming Bank Austria's ambitions and roared approval when chief executive Guido Schmidt-Chiari vowed to fight the bid.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not my bank but the bank for which I work....There is nothing friendly in this takeover bid,&quot; said the silver-haired 64-year-old who has served Creditanstalt for almost four decades.</p>
<p>He won backing from senior conservative politicians, who have balked at what they consider to be an aggressive, socialist bid for Austria's most traditional bank, founded by the Rothschild family in 1863.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt, headed by patrician Schmidt-Chiari since 1988, is a close ally of the junior conservative coalition partner, the People's Party.</p>
<p>Bank Austria, managed by motorcycle enthusiast Gerhard Randa since 1995, is controlled by the City of Vienna, still a stronghold of the ruling Social Democrats, who for the first time were forced to go into coalition with the conservatives, as in the federal government, after city elections in October.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see a genuine privatisation, not a communalisation,&quot; conservative Economy Minister Johann Farnleitner said.</p>
<p>Schmidt-Chiari urged Social Democrat Finance Minister Viktor Klima to think long and hard before awarding the state's 70 percent of Creditanstalt ordinary shares to Bank Austria and rejected a rival bid from an EA-Generali led group.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a question of quality. An institution will not survive international competition through size alone,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two banks would have a combined domestic market share of 25 percent in terms of assets. They would control around 70 percent of commercial banking, 80 percent of Vienna stock exchange trade and roughly half of export financing.</p>
<p>They would also have enormous industrial muscle, exercising control over fibre maker Lenzing and enjoying a massive influence in the construction sector.</p>
<p>Analysts say the takeover would bring big job losses and a wave of branch closures -- mainly affecting Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>Bank Austria workers are protected from redundancy by a quirk in Austrian employment law that differentiates between the savings bank sector, to which Bank Austria belongs, and commercial banks like Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>Far-right leader Joerg Haider, sensing political mileage in the row, said he a favoured a link-up of the nation's two biggest banks but argued the state should withdraw its influence from both institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle this is a step in the right direction, especially in a European context,&quot; Haider said. &quot;(But) our long-term goal should be a complete privatisation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bank Austria is reportedly bidding 804 schillings for each of the state's 19.9 million Creditanstalt shares - well above the most recent 720-730 schillings offer from the EA-Generali group. Final bids have to be in on Monday.</p>
