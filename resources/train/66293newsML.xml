<title>USA: COMEX copper ends lower but defies LME contango.</title>
<headline>COMEX copper ends lower but defies LME contango.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX copper tumbled Friday as LME broke through support at $1,900 per tonne amid signs that the fledgling contango in London was finding its feet while New York stubbornly remained in backwardation.</p>
<p>&quot;The support area finally gave up, but it's surprising that copper has closed up on the week even after this disastrous close,&quot; said Richard Hirsch of Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals. There was no fresh fundamental news.</p>
<p>COMEX December copper slipped below support levels at 88.00 cents per pound.</p>
<p>Copper failed to make any convincing headway on the upside during the week as LME quietly slipped into contango for the first time since January 1995. The cash to three months contango or cash discount over forwards, was about $12.</p>
<p>A contango is a sign that nearby supplies are not tight, but LME stocks fell 2,900 tonnes Friday to 265,450 tonnes. COMEX stocks rose 295 short tons Friday to 20,176 short tons.</p>
<p>December COMEX settled 2.40 cents off at 87.80 cents per pound, traded 89.80 to 87.10 cents. Spot September went out 2.55 cents lower at 89.00 cents. Volume was estimated at 10,000 lots.</p>
<p>COMEX is still at a premium over LME, a sign of the good physical demand in the U.S. where scrap metal is tight.</p>
