<p>Wilt disease killing Zaire's coffee trees surfaced three years ago, but a revolt in the east has hampered efforts to study and control it, a state coffee board official said.</p>
<p>Christian Feruzi, Commercial Director of the Zairean Coffee Office (OZACAF), told Reuters in an interview that production and export data since war started in October was limited and contradictory.  </p>
<p>No coffee from rebel-controlled eastern regions was included in export data, he said, adding that about 10,000 tonnes of coffee was exported from October to December 1996 from the west.</p>
<p>&quot;IACO (Interafrican Coffee Organisation) and Zaire are carrying out a study to see how much of our production is recoverable but the war is handicapping efforts,&quot; Feruzi said in the interview at an African coffee meeting in Ivory Coast.  </p>
<p>Rebels under Laurent Kabila, who has vowed to topple Zaire's veteran president Mobutu Sese Seko, control much of the east and are poised to attack Kisangani, Zaire's third largest city.</p>
<p>Feruzi said coffee exports made up 15 percent of Zaire's export revenue before the war, after copper and diamonds.</p>
<p>&quot;Where Kabila is in command we cannot get production estimations for the east. We are completely cut off from people on the ground,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Most arabica is grown around the eastern town of Goma and in remote eastern hills in North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda. Lesser amounts are grown in South Kivu.</p>
<p>Robusta is grown throughout Zaire, except in mineral-rich Shaba region in the south.</p>
<p>Feruzi said wilt disease or Tracheomycosis surfaced up to three years ago but had already cut into production volumes.  </p>
<p>&quot;Before the war the Office du Cafe took intiatives to stamp out the disease by uprooting trees, burning and replanting new stock,&quot; he said. &quot;The ICO (International Coffee Organisation) is studying a request we made for help with the programme and we are hoping for a reply soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Feruzi said output was growing before the war.</p>
<p>Coffee production totalled about 100,000 tonnes in 1995/96 (Oct/Sept). &quot;Only 60,000 tonnes was exportable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;About 55 percent of our coffee came from eastern regions (now occupied by rebels) and 45 percent from Western areas (still in Zairean government hands),&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Export data from January 1997 were not available. &quot;About 10,000 tonnes of western regional coffee was exported from October to December 1996, mainly from Boma and Matadi ports.&quot;</p>
<p>Feruzi said exports were strongest from October to December with June to August exports higher than January to June.</p>
<p>OZACAF said in January rebels in the east were trying to legitimise export procedures, adding that a lack of security for buyers meant most coffee would probably be smuggled abroad.  </p>
<p>&quot;Exports are escaping all official state agencies,&quot; Feruzi said, citing Uganda and other neighbours as likely exit points.</p>
<p>Uganda, Africa's largest coffee producer and another wilt sufferer, said smuggling did not show up in trade data.</p>
<p>&quot;The quantities are negligeable,&quot; Uganda Coffee Development Authority Secretary-General William Naggaga told Reuters. &quot;Our figures do not show a lot of smuggling,&quot; he said in Abidjan.  </p>
<p>Uganda had no role in selling its coffee but did monitor quality at export warehouses, he said.</p>
<p>Zaire coffee usually goes to western ports by road or rail.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know how many trucks and trains have been trapped but supply routes have all been cut. Farmers are most likely not selling except in remote areas,&quot; said Feruzi.</p>
<p>Some of Zaire's estimated 30 state-approved exporters, some with operations in both eastern and western areas, had fled to western Zaire, said Feruzi. Numbers were not clear.  </p>
<p>Zaire last week agreed a new export limit for its les busy January to June period.</p>
<p>African producers met in Ivory Coast last week to share out a 850,000 bags export cut agreed at an Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) meeting in Brazil in January.</p>
<p>Zaire was allocated 7.86 percent (66,180 bags) of the cut.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire has agreed to limit coffee exports to 331,000 bags (20,000 tonnes) between January and June (1997),&quot; said Feruzi.</p>
<p>OZACAF comes under Zaire's umbrella coffee policy unit, the Commission Mercuriale de Prix de Cafe, which groups ministerial, customs, banking, quality and other functions.</p>
