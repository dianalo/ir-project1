<title>USA: Blue-chips fall, Nasdaq peak, bonds fall.</title>
<headline>Blue-chips fall, Nasdaq peak, bonds fall.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks fell for a second consecutive day amid profit-taking before the Thanksgiving holiday, while the Nasdaq market hit a fourth record high in a row Wednesday as technology stocks roared ahead.</p>
<p>Bonds ended a shortened trading session higher.</p>
<p>The dollar rose amid fresh signs of economic weakness in Japan and renewed calls for a stronger dollar from European officials.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 29.07 points to 6,499.34, its biggest point loss so far in November.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index was up 6.12 points at a record of 1,287.32.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,308 to 1,121 on moderate volume of 377 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;The buzzword is: Intel and Microsoft. It's the same names and we have a broad-based chip rally. It's the only area doing really well today,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.</p>
<p>Bleier said the overall market is still on a bullish track.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not over yet,&quot; he said. &quot;Even though everyone likes to see a correction, it's just not happening here. The herd and the greed factor have taken over in the last few days. We know we are overvalued and we know we are up too much, but that's where the market stands.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. financial markets are closed Thursday for the holiday. The stock market will reopen Friday for an abbreviated session ending at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT).</p>
<p>The bond market rose on news that third-quarter gross domestic product growth was revised downward to 2.0 percent from 2.2 percent. The benchmark 30-year Treasury was up 6/32, or $1.88 on a $1,000 bond, lowering its yield to 6.43 percent from 6.45 percent at Tuesday's close. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Also reported was weekly jobless claims, which were unchanged at 342,000, and higher than the forecast 336,000 for the week of Nov. 23.</p>
<p>&quot;The data were pretty much in line, showing an economy growing at a reasonably slow pace with few signs of inflationary pressure,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 113.30 Japanese yen from 112.50 late Tuesday and also climbed to 1.5270 German marks from 1.5245.</p>
<p>Wheat futures prices tumbled at three major U.S. futures exchanges partly in reaction to foreign buyers shunning U.S. wheat in favour of Australian and Argentinian grain.</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade December soft red winter wheat closed down 12-1/2 cents at $4.00-1/2 per bushel. Kansas City Board of Trade hard red winter wheat closed down 6 cents at $4.44 and Minneapolis Grain Exchange December spring wheat was down 2-3/4 at $4.20-1/2.</p>
<p>New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil futures closed higher on short-covering ahead of the holiday.</p>
<p>Crude for January delivery closed up 13 cents at $23.75 per barrel. NYMEX gasoline for January delivery rose 34 cents to 69.35 cents per gallon.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index lost 19.2 points to 4,049.2. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 72.97 points, or 0.34 percent, to 21,345.28.</p>
