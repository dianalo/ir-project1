<p>A series of explosions on the outskirts of Phnom Penh caused near panic in the capital on Friday as many people assumed that fighting between Cambodia's rival political factions had finally erupted, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The explosions were not the result of Cambodia's current tension, however, but came from a land-mine clearing training centre where workers were practising how to destroy the devices, officals said. The explosions were clearly heard in the city centre, and almost immediately the streets were full of frightened parents and tearful schoolchildren rushing home while merchants slammed down the shutters on their shops, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Heavily armed military police were soon on the streets stopping cars and motorcycles and checking for weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sorry about this, that we did not make a public announcement before. We only informed the people living in the vicinity of the training school,&quot; Information Minister Ieng Mouly told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We will find out who provoked the turmoil in the city and we will punish them,&quot; said Ieng Mouly, who is also president of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre that runs the training school where the explosions took place.</p>
<p>A long-running feud between the two leaders of Cambodia's coalition government has led to fears that there could be fighting between the two sides.</p>
<p>A shot was fired at a car in which co-Prime Minister Hun Sen was travelling on Wednesday evening, injuring one of his security men. Earlier, up to 19 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in a grenade attack on an opposition rally in the city on March 30.</p>
