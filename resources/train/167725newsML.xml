<p>Istanbul shares firmed on selective buying led by shares of largely state-owned firms on Tuesday, but volume dropped and trade remained range-bound, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed at 81,894.64, up 723.38 points, or 0.89 percent from Monday when it lost 1.69 percent. It moved between 80,787-81,885 during the day.</p>
<p>Trade volume dived to 16.73 trillion lira ($172 million) from Monday's 21.64 trillion ($223.4 million).</p>
<p>&quot;The index looks settled at these levels and the market is in a sideways trend because most shares carry premiums and are not suitable to buy,&quot; said Murat Iman from Ata securities.</p>
<p>&quot;There was activity only in state shares due to privatisation expectations and in a few others with comparatively low prices,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brokers were expecting range-bound trade this week between 81,000 and 84,000 after the index failed to pierce the critical 85,000 barrier last Thursday. Major support is seen at 80,000 if 81,000 is broken.</p>
<p>The index had surged 29.3 percent from September 13 to an all-time high close of 83,772.33 on October 23, the tenth record in an uptrend which began with the breaching of 65,000 level.</p>
