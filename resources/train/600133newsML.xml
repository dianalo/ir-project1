<text>
<p>A scandal centred on Japan's biggest brokerage took a twist with possible political repercussions on Tuesday when the chief government spokesman said three cabinet ministers held accounts at the firm.</p>
<p>But Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said that while three cabinet members currently had &quot;dealings&quot; with Nomura, they were not getting preferential treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;I have checked with the three ministers and there is no connection (to the Nomura payoff scandal),&quot; Kajiyama told a regular news conference.</p>
<p>Kajiyama acknowledged, however, that his survey of ministers &quot;did not dig deeply into the past&quot; nor did it include family members.</p>
<p>Prosecutors last week arrested racketeer Ryuichi Koike and raided Nomura's head office and branches after taking in two former Nomura managing directors and another senior official suspected of violating Japan's Commercial Code and Securities and Exchange Law with payoffs to the &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer.</p>
<p>The investigation is focusing on whether other top Nomura executives were aware of the payoffs or whether, as the brokerage maintains, the officials involved acted on their own.</p>
<p>But prosecutors are also probing for signs of possible misdeeds linked to so-called &quot;VIP accounts&quot; set up for elite customers including bureaucrats and politicians. Nomura has denied preferential treatment was given to the account holders.</p>
<p>In another sign the scandal was widening, prosecutors on Tuesday also entered the headquarters of one of Japan's top commercial banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB).</p>
<p>A DKB spokesman said some 100 officers from the Tokyo Prosecutors' Office had entered the headquarters building, but could not confirm the purpose of the move.</p>
<p>A bank spokesman said later that the bank regretted the situation, adding: &quot;We will cooperate fully with investigations in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>DKB declined to comment on media reports that it had made questionable loans to Ryuichi Koike, arrested last week along with his younger brother Yoshinori Koike on suspicion of violating Japan's Commercial Code by taking some 50 million yen ($438,000) in illegal payments from Nomura.</p>
<p>The Commercial Code bans companies from making payments to &quot;sokaiya&quot;, racketeers who typically extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Mainichi Shimbun reported that Ryuichi Koike owned about 20,000 DKB shares under various assumed names, and often attended DKB's annual shareholders' meeting as a &quot;friendly sokaiya&quot;.</p>
<p>Typically, &quot;friendly sokaiya&quot; use their influence to stop &quot;enemy sokaiya&quot; from making extortion attempts at annual shareholders' meetings.</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers said DKB holds problem loans worth 7.5 billion yen ($65.7 million) linked to Koike, and that another financial firm with close ties with DKB has Koike-linked bad loans worth 1.2 billion yen ($10.5 million).</p>
<p>After the Nomura payoff scandal was revealed in early March, media reports said DKB loaned three billion yen ($26.3 million) in 1989 to a real estate company owned by the younger Koike. The reports said the elder Koike used the money to buy 300,000 shares in each of the nation's top four brokerages including Nomura, and put up the shares as collateral for the DKB loans.</p>
<p>Financial analysts said for now the latest developments were embarrassing for DKB but were unlikely to seriously hurt the bank's business.</p>
<p>For Nomura, suffering from defections by corporate, government and individual clients, and facing probable stiff administrative penalties and a court case, the outlook is grimmer, the analysts said. ($1=114 yen)</p>
