<title>USA: NY precious metals end mostly lower, volumes low.</title>
<headline>NY precious metals end mostly lower, volumes low.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended mostly lower, with the exception of silver on Monday, but volumes were low.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the prospects for European Monetary Union (EMU), engendered by the Socialists win in the French elections on Sunday and the dispute between the Bundesbank and German government last week, may provide support for gold longer term, analyst said.</p>
<p>But meantime a higher U.S. dollar on Monday, kept pressure on gold, while platinum group metals were hit again by nervousness over the resumption of Russian exports.  </p>
<p>&quot;A delay in EMU could lessen the potential of near term supply pressure from European central banks,&quot; Smith Barney analyst David Rinehimer said.</p>
<p>COMEX August gold ended down $1.00 at $346.50 an ounce, retreating from a ten-day high at $350.40 seen Friday on fund short covering. COMEX gold open interest fell 3,543 lots Friday to 150,326 contracts.</p>
<p>August gold's five day moving-average remains below its 21-day average and its 55-day average, but there is little momentum to the downtrend, analysts noted.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $343.30/70 an ounce, compared to the London Monday afternoon fix at $343.90 and the New York close Friday around $344.40/90.</p>
<p>In other news, a one-day national strike in South Africa on Monday, called by the Confederation of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) affected only about 20 percent of gold mines, but the union has threatened to repeat the strike in 14-days.</p>
<p>Gold prices have bounced three times from the $340 level since touching four year lows in January around $336.00 an ounce, but the upside remains capped by potential gold sales European central banks and a general lack of investor demand, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to feel that the nearby gold futures will likely maintain a a trading range from $335 to $375 through year end,&quot; Rinehimer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Upside price potential is expected to be capped by expectations for gold sales by central banks and relatively high real interest rates in the U.S., while good demand from developing countries should constrain price declines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment toward central bank gold sales (real or perceived) should remain the dominant fundamental which determines from which (side of the) price band a breakout occurs.&quot;</p>
<p>COMEX July silver ended up 2.3 cents at $4.698 an ounce, recovering from Friday's sharp fall.</p>
<p>&quot;We would buy the July contract at $4.65 or better in anticipation of a continuation fo the current trading range and look to take profits if it appears the market cannot clear the $4.90-$5.00 barrier,&quot; Rinehimer said.</p>
<p>Trade data continues to suggest robust demand for silver from Japan and India.</p>
<p>For the first four months of 1997, Japan imported 480 tonnes of silver, 19 percent above landings for the same period last year.</p>
<p>And a doubling in April silver re-exports from Dubai to India to 95 tonnes against 48 tonnes in March provided further evidence of strong Indian demand, analysts said.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum closed down $2.50 at $398.70 an ounce, after seeing a contract high last week at $420.50.</p>
<p>But the July/October spread ended up 2.5 cents at 6.5 cents, though it was still off last week's highs around $9.00.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the October NYMEX platinum/October gold spread slipped to $43.50 an ounce from a contract high at $52.60 last week.</p>
<p>NYMEX September palladium was down $7.50 an ounce at $165.50 cents, after seeing a contract high at $185.00 last week.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some fund liquidation into a thin market in both platinum and palladium,&quot; RJ Futures managing director and floor trader Ralph D'Esposito said.</p>
<p>In overnight news, officials from Russia's metal export agency, Almaz, arrived in Japan for talks on renewing the export supply contract for PGM's which expired last December.</p>
<p>But lending rates for palladium remained high around 30 percent in the physical market, reflecting the shortage caused by the absence of Russian exports for five months. ((Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk, +1-212-859-1641))</p>
