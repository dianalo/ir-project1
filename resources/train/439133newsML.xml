<p>U.S. investment in Russia will jump in the next few years as investors follow a trend to move funds out of the U.S. and into well-performing emerging markets, Western bankers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>William Donaldson, a founder of and senior adviser at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette investment bank, predicted that the U.S. could invest close to $600 million overseas in the next three years.</p>
<p>He told a news conference the bank calculated portfolios which average five percent foreign exposure would move to 10-12 percent in &quot;a very short period of time&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;How much of that is coming to Russia? -- I would say a good portion,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Bank of New York Vice President Christopher Sturdy, who heads the bank's programme of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) for Eastern and Western Europe, said that $3.6 billion had been invested in Russian equity via ADRs in the last 15 months.</p>
<p>ADRs allow allow foreign trading of local issues.</p>
<p>Richard Bernard, Executive Vice President of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), said natural resources, telecoms and power companies would lead the move towards foreign listings.</p>
<p>&quot;We could easily have four more Russian companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange during 1997 and over the next 3-5 years we could easily see 20-25 Russian companies listed.&quot;</p>
<p>Full listing and new capital raising on the NYSE through level three ADRs has only been accomplished by Vimpelcom cellular phone operator.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers in a recent paper said likely level three issuers in 1997 were oil companies LUKoil and Chernogorneft and Rostelekom long distance phone company.</p>
<p>It said companies which could issue in 1998 were oil companies Tatneft, Surgutneftegaz and Purneftegaz and power utilities Mosenergo and Irkutskenergo.</p>
