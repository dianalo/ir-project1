<headline>Ukraine alumina plant says wants to sell to Russia.</headline>

<p>Ukraine's largest alumina factory, the Mykolayiv plant, said on Monday that it planned to sell the bulk of its 1997 output to Russia, even though it had not yet signed any supply contracts, a company official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our alumina plant plans to sell 90 percent of our total alumina production this year to Russia, about the same as last year,&quot; deputy commercial director Hennady Bushtruk told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that it will be no less than 90 percent, while the rest will go to Tajikistan and a small amount to Ukraine's smelter at Zaporizhya,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The  Mykolayivsky Hlynozemny Zavod (MHZ) accounts for virtually all Ukraine's alumina production, and part of its output is sent to Ukraine's AT Zaporizhsky Aluminyovy Zavod (ZAZ) smelter.</p>
<p>Russian smelters, including Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk, have complained that Mykolayivskiy is asking above-world prices and have said they have not yet signed contracts with Mikolayivskiy.</p>
<p>Bushtruk said Ukraine, which has forecast production of 1.2 million tonnes of alumina this year, is negotiating prices with Russia and the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we want a higher price&quot; than what Russian and Tajik companies are offering, Bushtruk said, but he did not provide details.</p>
<p>Ukraine produced 1.06 million tonnes of alumina over the first 11 months of 1996, compared to 996,000 tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>The bulk of Ukraine's alumina, made from bauxite imported from West Africa, is traditionally sold to Russia.</p>
<p>Officials in Ukraine late last year announced plans to modernise ZAZ over three years to step up foil production.</p>
<p>Plans included buying about 200,000 tonnes of alumina from the Mykolayiv plant.</p>
<p>The government also plans to phase out alumina production at the energy-inefficient Zaporizhya plant.</p>
