<p>Luc Van Lierde of Belgium, competing in the event of the first time, overcame a three-minute penalty for drafting during the cycling portion to win the 20th Ironman Triathlon World Championship Saturday.</p>
<p>Van Lierde overtook German Thomas Hellriegel with about three miles (5 km) left to win in a course record of eight hours, four minutes and eight seconds.</p>
<p>Van Lierde earned $35,000 for his victory in the 2.4-mile (3.9km) swim, 112-mile (180.2km) cycling race and 26.2-mile (42.2km) marathon. He picked up an additional $5,000 bonus for breaking the previous course record of 8:07:45 set by six-time winner Mark Allen of the United States in 1993.</p>
<p>Hellriegel, who set a cycling split record of 4:24:50, was second for the second successive year in 8:06:07. Australian Greg Welch, the 1994 winner, was third in 8:18:57.</p>
<p>Hellriegel was also in front last year before losing the lead at about the same spot he relinquished it Saturday.</p>
<p>Paula Newby-Fraser of Zimbabwe, who announced her retirement last year but decided to compete again just last week, passed Natascha Badmann of Switerzland with about four miles (6.5km) left and claimed her eighth women's title in 9:06:40.</p>
<p>Newby-Fraser, who was also penalised three minutes for drafting during the cycling segment, also earned $35,000. She finished about 11 minutes slower than her record time of 8:55:28 set in 1992.</p>
<p>Badmann was second in 9:11:17, with defending champion Karen Smyers of the United States third in 9:19:13.</p>
