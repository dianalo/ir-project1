<p>Indonesia's GDP will grow by 7.3 percent in 1997 and 7.8 percent in 1998, with rising foreign direct investment (FDI) likely to continue, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) forecasts in a review for Indonesia.</p>
<p>The PECC, an independent policy-oriented organisation of business, academic and government representatives from 22 Asia-Pacific economies, released its 1997-98 outlook for countries in the region on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It said that with no successor to President Suharto in sight, 1997 could be a transitional year from an investment perspective.</p>
<p>Suharto is 76 next Sunday and is widely expected to run for a seventh five-year term of office in March next year. There is keen interest in who he selects as a running mate -- and potential successor given his age.</p>
<p>&quot;In our forecast, the trend of increasing FDI is likely to continue, not only because of the country's macroeconomic stability, but also due to the presence of a series of strong 'pull factors',&quot; the PECC report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic private investment will also continue to provide a strong push to the economy. Double digit investment growth is expected in 1997, and it could accelerate in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The resulting GDP (gross domestic product) growth forecasts for 1997 and 1998 are 7.3 and 7.8 percent respectively,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said the economy was remarkably strong in 1996 with estimated 7.8 percent growth, despite some civil and political turmoil.</p>
<p>It also said the government had clearly shown fiscal discipline in keeping a tight 1997-98 budget, despite the May general elections, and said this would boost private sector confidence.</p>
<p>In its risk forecast, the PECC said the most important risks were related more to non-economic factors.</p>
<p>It noted riots in the country in the second half of 1996 and the first few months of this year. The presidential election was also clouded with uncertainty over the succession issue, while concerns over income disparity could become significant.</p>
<p>&quot;If civil disturbances occur...the investment climate could be damaged and the forecast may need to be adjusted downward,&quot; the PECC report said.</p>
