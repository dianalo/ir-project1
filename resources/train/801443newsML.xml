<p>Pakistani off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq claimed a hat-trick as Surrey took control of their English county championship game against Middlesex at Lord's on Friday.</p>
<p>Saqlain, who finished with figures of five for 50, took the scalps of Keith Brown, Richard Johnson and Jamie Hewitt as Middlesex collapsed from 142 for two to 162 for nine and were eventually bowled out for 205 on the first day of the four day match.</p>
<p>Surrey closed on 123 for two.</p>
<p>With leaders Kent not playing, second placed Glamorgan had high hopes of closing the 12-point gap against Worcestershire, a team without a home win all season. However, it did not work out that way as Tim Curtis hit 160 to help his side to 342 for four.</p>
<p>Another man in the runs was Australian Darren Lehmann, who hammered 182 to put Yorkshire in a very strong position against Hampshire at Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Lehmann's five-and-a-half hour innings enabled Yorkshire to recover from 39 for two and end the day on 389 for six.</p>
<p>Bottom county Derbyshire took charge against Lancashire as former Lancashire all-rounder Phil DeFreitas hit 96 off just 80 balls to rescue his team from 99 for four to close on 408 for nine.</p>
<p>Gloucestershire had Bobby Dawson (98) to thank for their total of 291 for eight against Sussex after they were struggling at 76 for three.</p>
<p>In the day's other game Somerset closed against Nottinghamshire on 290 for six.</p>
