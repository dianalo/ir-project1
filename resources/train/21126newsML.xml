<p>British investment bank Hambros Plc is likely to stay independent for the foreseeable future despite sharp criticism from a new shareholder which said it was undervalued and badly managed, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Banking analysts said Hambros, one of Britain's dying breed of independent merchant banks, was an unattractive bid target because it lacked the key characteristics of a traditional investment bank and its performance lagged the market.</p>
<p>However, Hambros shares were stoked by speculative buying as some analysts ran a slide rule over the group and calculated that the sum of its parts was worth more than the current total valuation.</p>
<p>The shares hit a year high of 280 pence before slipping back to 269 pence, up 2-1/2 pence, as speculation mounted that a bidder might break the bank up.</p>
<p>Hambros took centre stage after Regent Pacific, more usually an agitator in the investment fund market, snapped up a three percent stake in the bank.</p>
<p>British newspapers said Jim Mellon, who runs Regent Pacific, wanted to improve the bank's poor record. Regent Pacific was not available for comment on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Hambros appears to us to be an undervalued and undermanaged enterprise. Over the last 10 years these shares have been diabolical,&quot; Mellon was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Few analysts were prepared to quibble, saying the managers of the bank were also aware of its weak performance.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree on both counts,&quot; said one banking analyst, who asked not be named.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a company where returns for shareholders have not been as good as for others in the same sector,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Mellon was quoted as seeking a meeting to discuss Hambros strategy and a Hambros spokesman said this would take place.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in regular contact with all our major shareholders and we would be happy to meet our new shareholder at some convenient time in the future,&quot; the Hambros spokesman said.</p>
<p>Once hailed as one of London's top banks, Hambros hit trouble in recent years as it struggled with mounting bad debts and sliding profits.</p>
<p>In 1995 its pre-tax profits fell to 20.6 million pounds ($32.1 million) from 37.1 million the year before, while bad debt provisions rocketed to 36.2 million from 13.5 million.</p>
<p>The bank made clear in its annual report that it knew shareholders were unclear about its focus -- whether it was a banking group with investments or a financial services conglomerate -- after many of its fellow investment banks were snapped up by foreign rivals.</p>
<p>After a strategic review, it announced that its core business was merchant banking and direct investment. Analysts say Hambros was taking steps to cut back bad debts and lending at a higher margin to clients who also want corporate advice.</p>
<p>It also has a 52 percent holding in estate agency Hambro Countrywide, which on Thursday returned to profit, and a 54 percent stake in Hambro Insurance Service.</p>
<p>But analysts say none of these represent traditional merchant banking activities and this explains why speculation has grown that Hambros is worth more in parts than as a whole.</p>
<p>One analyst calculated a value of 274 pence per share by taking the book value of the banking group and adding in the market valuation of stakes in Hambro Countrywide and Insurance and the 162 million pound value of its property portfolio.</p>
<p>That excludes any goodwill value from its eight billion pounds of funds under management, the analyst added.</p>
<p>&quot;We've known for some time that it has more value on break-up,&quot; he said, adding that Regent Pacific had helped highlight the phenomenon.</p>
<p>But buyers may still be slow to come forward, even though German banks like Commerzbank are regularly cited as potential bidders for British merchant banks.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be a buyer and this might tilt the balance,&quot; said the analyst. &quot;But Regent Pacific aren't going to do it themselves and unless they've got a buyer lined up...this isn't the death threat&quot;. ($1=.6412 Pound)</p>
