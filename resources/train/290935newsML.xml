<p>Indonesia's armed forces commander General Feisal Tanjung said on Tuesday the military would arrest people suspected of inciting two religious riots on the main island of Java last year.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency quoted Tanjung as saying the military had named some people, whom he called &quot;intellectual actors&quot;, suspected of involvement in the riots in Tasikmalaya, West Java last month, and in Situbondo, East Java, in October.</p>
<p>Tanjung said the suspects would be arrested and sent to trial. He gave no other details.</p>
<p>A mob of mainly-Moslem youths set buildings and churches ablaze in Tasikmalaya, apparently incensed by a report of police brutality towards some Moslem religious teachers. Four people, including two ethnic Chinese, died in the riots.</p>
<p>A Moslem mob in Situbondo burned 25 churches as well as other buildings in a rampage sparked by the trial of a Moslem heretic who was subsequently jailed for blasphemy.</p>
<p>Five Christians died in one blazing church.</p>
<p>&quot;We know there are intellectual actors behind the Tasikmalaya and Situbondo riots. We have recorded their identity,&quot; Tanjung was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He did not mention last week's ethnic riots in West Kalimantan, where five people were killed.</p>
<p>The riots erupted after a man from Madura island off Java reportedly stabbed two native Borneo Dayak tribesmen in a row over a woman.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 people of the Maduran ethnic group, who moved to Kalimantan in a government resettlement programme, fled the riot area to safety. Six people have been arrested for alleged incitement of the riots.</p>
