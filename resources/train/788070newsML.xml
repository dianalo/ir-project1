<p>The U.N. Security Council on Friday ruled out immediate authorisation for a peacekeeping operation in the Congo Republic, saying not enough progress had been made on a political settlement and a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Council President Sir John Weston of Britain said the 15-member body would consider approval when there was a &quot;full cease-fire&quot; and a political settlement was within reach.</p>
<p>He also said heavy weapons had to be moved away from the airport in the capital, Brazzaville, which peacekeepers are supposed to guard.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only when they have done that that we will be able to consider where to go from there,&quot; he told reporters after informal council consultations.</p>
<p>Asked when he thought the situation would be ripe for international troops, Weston said: &quot;It is like a camel. I can't always describe it but I know one when I see one.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his special envoy for the region, Mohamed Sahnoun, have proposed an advance force of about 1,000 troops outside of the U.N. structure in an effort to organise it quickly. They want this force eventually to be increased and approved as a U.N. operation.</p>
<p>Some 17 African countries are ready to join such a force..</p>
<p>The entire venture has been tenuous from the start with diplomats questioning whether Washington would approve or help underwrite the operation in light of Congress' reluctance to pay U.N. arrears as well as support any new missions.</p>
<p>A peacekeeping force would be financed by all U.N. members whereby a multinational force would need voluntary funds from the participants or other interested countries. In either case, authorisation from the 15-member Security Council is needed to give the operation legitimacy.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out on June 5 after President Pascal Lissouba sent troops to surround the home of his predecessor, Denis Sassou Nguesso, as part of a crackdown on private militias.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people died, many of them civilians killed by indiscriminate shelling, before a fragile ceasefire took effect in Brazzaville on July 14.</p>
<p>U.N. Undersecretary-General Bernard Miyet, the French head of peacekeeping, was more optimistic saying that fighting had decreased considerably.</p>
<p>He said aid workers, such as the Red Cross, were now able to spend the night in Brazzaville rather than commuting to Kinshasa across the river.</p>
<p>Miyet recently sent a technical survey team to Brazzaville, which was fired on. &quot;We are not there yet. A political agreement has not been signed,&quot; he said.</p>
