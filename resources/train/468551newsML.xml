<p>English premier league club Derby have signed Estonian international goalkeeper Mart Poom from FC Flora Tallinn for 500,000 pounds sterling ($808,000).</p>
<p>The former Portsmouth player, who also had a loan spell at Leeds, was in goal when Estonia held Scotland to a 0-0 World Cup draw in February and is due to play against the Scots in Saturday's return match at Kilmarnock.</p>
<p>Poom has been Estonia's regular goalkeeper since the country returned to international soccer in 1991 and, with more than 40 appearances to his name, is their most-capped player since independence.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt we needed a top quality goalkeeper,&quot; said Derby manager Jim Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I had Mart when I was at Portsmouth and always felt that technically he could be a top keeper, especially given his desire to work.&quot;</p>
<p>Poom is likely to make his debut for Derby in their league game at Manchester United on April 5.</p>
<p>&quot;I promised myself I'd be back in English football and the chance has come sooner than I expected,'' said Poom.</p>
