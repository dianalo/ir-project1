<title>CHILE: Chile exchange move to reduce external influence.</title>

<p>Chile's Central Bank changed the currency basket used to set exchange rates to reduce the influence of external factors on the country's economy, said Bank president Carlos Massad.</p>
<p>&quot;The measures were taken to prevent changes in economic conditions abroad, which have nothing to do with the Chilean economy, from having an impact on the country which is not justified,&quot; Massad told a news conference.  </p>
<p>The bank announced Monday that it had raised the weight of the U.S. dollar in the currency basket, while the German mark and the Japanese yen were reduced to 15 percent and five percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The bank also widened the band within which the peso can float either side of the dollar from a margin of 10 percent to 12.5 percent.</p>
<p>The moves were designed to brake the relentless rise in the dollar against the Chilean peso over the last two months which had threatened to fuel inflation.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is not doubt that if we had continued with the (existing) currency band, then there would have been foreign pressure which would have made the adjustment deeper... which would have been unjustifiable,&quot; said Massad.</p>
<p>The Chilean economy has been in a period of &quot;adjustment&quot; for the last year since the bank jacked up interest rates to cool the country's robust economic growth.</p>
