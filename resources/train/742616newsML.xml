<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine vandals deface 50 Jewish graves.</title>

<p>About 50 Jewish graves in a small town in rural Argentina have been vandalised for the second time in less than a year, apparently by children, local Jewish leaders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Silvia Maszier, head of the Israeli Assocation in Entre Rios province northwest of Buenos Aires, said vandals broke into a cemetery in the town of Villa Clara, founded by the first Jewish settlers in Argentina at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;They desecrated 50 Jewish tombs, smashing photos on the headstones and ripping off plaques,&quot; she told Reuters. &quot;It looks like an attack by children but this goes beyond the childish prank. It already happened last October.&quot;</p>
<p>Maszier said police also were investigating whether the firing of shots into the air near a Jewish community club in the regional capital, Parana, in the early hours of Sunday was also an anti-Jewish attack, or an unrelated incident.</p>
<p>Argentina's Jewish community, one of the largest in the world, has been the target of two devastating bomb attacks in recent years: one at the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 that killed 29 people, and a second at the city's AMIA Jewish community centre in 1994 that killed 86 people.</p>
<p>With no one arrested for the embassy attack and four policemen held on suspicion of providing the car used in the 1994 bombing, Jewish fear and frustration reached the boiling point at the third anniversary of the AMIA bomb on Friday, with speakers denouncing the government, police and courts.</p>
<p>The Jewish community says vandalism of its graves is common in Argentina, where anti-semitic groups are encouraged by the lack of progress in the investigations of the bombings.</p>
