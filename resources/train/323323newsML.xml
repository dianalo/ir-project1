<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- About 300 judges gathered at the Criminal Court in a show of solidarity aimed at prodding the prime minister into giving the judiciary control over the planned administrative court. Separately, PM Chavalit Yongchaiyudh says the administrative court's general affairs will not be handled by the Council of State. (BANGKOK POST) (THE NATION)</p>
<p>- Anand Panyarachun has been elected to chair the panel that will direct the writing of the constitution to chart the country's political future. The election of the former prime minister was hailed by Professor Prawase Wasi, who initiated the political reform idea. Prawase says public participation remains vital to the process and the government must coordinate with Parliament to push for the success of political reform. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- Thailand has reiterated that it cannot make decisions allowing the import of Cambodian timber without consent from Phnom Penh. To clarify the issue, Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has assigned National Security Council (NSC) chief to outline to the media government procedures to review requests to open border passages to import logs. The NSC is the main authority which considers applications submitted by Thai logging companies for border crossings to be opened. (THE NATION)</p>

<p>- The Cabinet today will consider the draft amendment to the Alien Business Law, approved yesterday by the Economics Affairs Screening Committee. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan says the change is aimed at liberalising local laws to bring them into line with global trends, and is part of Thailand's commitment to the World Trade Organisation and other global forums. The law signals a government efforts to liberalise visas and work-permits for expatriates, to streamline customs regulations, as well as bringing in additional foreign investors. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- The government should review its liberalisation of the petrochemical industry because it affects local producers and indirectly forces them to expand their production bases into other countries. The cabinet recently approved the reduction of import duty on five downstream petrochemical products to 27 percent from 30, effective from January 1 under Asean Free Trade Area agreements.
