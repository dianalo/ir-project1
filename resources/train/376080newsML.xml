<title>INDIA: India mid-air collision probe extended.</title>
<headline>India mid-air collision probe extended.</headline>

<p>The Indian government has given investigators an additional three months to finish a probe into the world's worst mid-air collision which killed 349 people last November, authorities said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Investigators had not finished retrieving data from the &quot;black boxes&quot; of the Saudi Arabian Airlines jet and Kazakh plane which collided on November 12 near New Delhi, said Kishan Singh, finance director of the Civil Aviation Ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation has been extended by three months,&quot; Singh said.</p>
<p>Three days after the disaster, the Civil Aviation Ministry named a four-member investigation team and asked it to present a report by February 15.</p>
<p>Singh said investigators were in Moscow examining the &quot;black box&quot; flight and cockpit voice recorders from the KazAir Ilyushin IL-76 and would next go to Britain to decode the Saudi Boeing 747's black box.</p>
<p>&quot;The decoding could not be done here and it does take time,&quot; Singh said.</p>
<p>The cause of the collision has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Initial speculation focused on outdated air traffic control equipment in New Delhi, but the Indian government was quick to defend its controllers and equipment.</p>
<p>Experts said one or both of the planes appeared not to have been at the height assigned by air traffic controllers. The Saudi jet was carrying 312 people and the Kazakh plane had 37.</p>
<p>Ground controllers had told the Saudi plane to climb to 14,000 feet (4,270 metres) as it took off. The KazAir pilot was told to stay at 15,000 feet (4,570 metres) as he approached New Delhi airport.</p>
<p>Saudi and Kazakh authorities have denounced speculation that pilot error or faulty equipment on board one of the aircraft led to the collision.</p>
