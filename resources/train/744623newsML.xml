<headline>Greenspan Q&amp;A--Income inequality, education Part I.</headline>
<text>
<p>Rep. Castle (R-Del) -- &quot;... All Americans being able to benefit from period of high economic growth... I'd like to have your thoughts on that.&quot;</p>
<p>GREENSPAN: &quot;As I testified before this committee before, we have a problem in this country in increasing dispersions of income, increasing inequality.</p>
<p>&quot;That has created a fairly pronounced degree of concern among policy makers generally ... The degree of inequality has apparently stabilized in the last two or three years, but there is no evidence of moving backwards.</p>
<p>&quot;In my judgement, the main cause of the increase that has occured over the years ... is that fairly dramatic increase in technology which in turn has enhanced the degree of education to a point where the income of those ... college graduates has widened significantly over those who are high school graduates...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing that I can see which will significantly impact on bringing back the type of income distribution which we had, say, 15, 20 years ago is increased education, increased on-the-job trainning, bringing up the skill levels of all Americans.&quot;</p>
