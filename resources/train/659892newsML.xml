<headline>Italian shares close up on buying surge.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1997-06-13</dateline>

<p>Italian shares closed higher in a flurry of across-the-board buying on Friday spurred by hopes of a breakthough in agreeing an EMU stability pact and U.S. data conveying a picture of non-inflationary growth.</p>
<p>The all-share Mibtel index jumped 2.33 percent to 12,761 while the blue chip Mib30 index rose 2.53 percent to 19,282. Turnover was unusually high, brokers said.</p>
<p>Telecom Italia and Stet shares rebounded after taking a battering at the start of the week after the Treasury announced there would be no conversion of savings shares into ordinary stock.</p>
<p>Telecom savings shares were up 6.76 percent at 3,300 lire while Stet savings shares soared 6.5 percent to 5,815 lire.</p>
<p>Parmalat, whose shares have swung wildly all week, while investors await the outcome of its bid to acquire Canadian food group Ault, finished 1.67 percent lower, one of the few major stocks to lose ground.</p>
<p>The Ault board announced shortly after the Milan bourse closed that it was recommending that its shareholders accept the Parmalat offer.</p>
<p>Turnover on the cash market totalled 2.1 trillion lire ($1.24 billion), up from 1.63 trillion lire on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders reported indiscriminate buying of insurance stocks, which have trailed the rest of the market in recent months, with Alleanza soaring 6.86 percent to 12,081 lire, INA up 5.48 percent to 2,675 lire, and RAS gaining 5.24 percent to 14,006 lire.</p>
<p>Clothes maker Benetton also shot up 6.56 percent to 25,383 lire but luxury goods producer Bulgari shed 3.96 percent to 9,590 lire on profit-taking. $=1,6990 lire</p>
