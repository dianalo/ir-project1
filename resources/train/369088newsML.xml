<p>South African Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau said on Tuesday she and the finance ministry were still discussing what would happen to revenue from the country's privatisation programme.</p>
<p>She told a news conference at parliament that it was too early to say when the first receipts from the planned partial sale of state telecommunications monopoly Telkom and following privatisations would end up in the government budget.</p>
<p>The department of finance wants the money to go as soon as possible into the budget, but Telkom has, for example, suggested that its proceeds should be channelled into a separate fund for telecommunications infrastructure development.</p>
<p>&quot;When it comes to proceeds the department of finance has a say,&quot; Sigcau said. &quot;We will (together) discuss what is best for the country.&quot;</p>
<p>She said that the overall performance of state enterprises last year was satisfactory and highlighted the revenue some were bringing in to the state.</p>
<p>Arms maker Denel, the flagship state company, paid 46.9 million rand in tax in the 1995/96 financial year and paid a dividend to the government of 100 million rand.</p>
<p>Forestry enterprise Safcol paid tax of 15 million rand and a dividend of 11 million in the same year.</p>
<p>Sigcau did not say how much the government hoped to earn from the privatisation of Telkom, airlines Sun Air and South African Airways, and several other sell-offs.  </p>
<p>In a later briefing, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Jay Naidoo said the government still expected to complete the sale of up to 30 percent of Telkom by April this year.</p>
<p>SBC Communications Inc and Telekom Malaysia Bhd have said they intend to bid jointly for the Telkom stake. The other two bidders are Deutsche Telekom AG and France Telecom who Naidoo said were currently looking at separate bids.</p>
