<p>Russia will be a big buyer of Iraqi oil once again as Baghdad gears up to export more crude to raise much-needed cash for food and medicine, Russian officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're aiming for as much this time as we had last time,&quot; said Yuri Agababov, deputy general director of Zarubezhneft, the Moscow-based firm coordinating Russian contracts for Iraqi oil under the United Nation's oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>The United Nations renewed a $2 billion, 180-day programme on Wednesday under which Iraq will export oil to raise cash for humanitarian needs and to pay reparations to Gulf War victims after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Russian companies bought nearly 28.54 billion barrels of Iraqi oil under the first 180-day programme, or a whopping 23.4 percent of the 121.6 million or so barrels Baghdad was permitted to export under that first deal.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hoping to do this much again,&quot; Agababov said in a brief telephone interview. &quot;But it will all depend on how the commercial terms of our talks proceed. Let's not jinx it by talking about it before it happens.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.N. resolution renews the programme from June 8, right after the first deal expires, and Agababov said he would head a delegation of Russian companies to Baghdad next week to begin negotiating contracts with Iraqi state oil firm SOMO.</p>
<p>He said talks had not yet taken place and declined to say whether contracts had been pre-negotiated in principle.</p>
<p>&quot;Those firms which participated will do so again, and there may be some new players,&quot; Agababov said, adding that Russian companies lifted their last loading of crude on May 22-25.</p>
<p>Russia has an inside track to Iraq, its Soviet-era trading partner and geopolitical ally, and is keen to see Baghdad flush with cash to repay the $7 billion it owes Moscow.</p>
<p>Russia's -- and one of the world's -- largest oil companies, LUKoil, has a 52.5 percent stake in a $4 billion, 23-year production-sharing project in Iraq's Western Qurnah oil field.</p>
<p>Other Russian firms, including Mashinoimport, have supplied Baghdad with oil equipment, and organisations close to the Foreign Trade Ministry sent wheat, sugar, vegetable oils and other foodstuffs.</p>
<p>But Agababov said commerce, not politics, was at work in the oil-for-food deal. &quot;We'll participate on the same level and terms as others,&quot; he said. &quot;It all comes down to the terms of the contracts.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to say how the terms had been attractive to the eight Russian oil-producing and trading companies which had contracts under the first deal.</p>
<p>Benchmark Brent Blend's nearby contract, a benchmark for valueing Iraq's exports and thus their quantity, was around $18.74 a barrel in early London futures trade.</p>
<p>That was more than $5.00 below the December 10, 1996 nearby-contract level when Iraq first returned to world oil markets under the first U.N. programme.</p>
<p>But Russian traders, who are finding it tougher to win access to tight domestic export pipelines, are keen to get their hands on any oil they can.</p>
<p>Vladimir Bjedougov, deputy head of major trader Alfa-Eko's international section, which had a big contract under the first programme, said lifters had taken a hit from what he called the failure of the U.N.-Iraqi price formula to reflect the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices fluctuated fairly sharply for a while and the formula didn't reflect the difference -- but I wouldn't say this experience would have any effect on our next talks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary, it will make things easier. The first contract went well, even though in any deal, there are always technical problems -- but none of them were critical.&quot;</p>
