<p>South Africa's police minister was verbally abused by a policeman when the minister tried to stop the manhandling of a rape suspect being arrested, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sydney Mufamadi, the country's first black police minister, was appointed by President Nelson Mandela three years ago to transform the image of the former white-led police force into a community-friendly service.</p>
<p>The usually unassuming minister was on his way to a shop to buy newspapers when he stumbled across the arrest on Saturday night in Johannesburg's Joubert Park, an inner city flatland.</p>
<p>&quot;In the opinion of the minister, excessive force was being used against the suspect and he objected strenuously,&quot; said the office of the national police chief, George Fivaz.</p>
<p>&quot;A verbal exchange then took place between the minister and the reservist in question,&quot; the office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Internal departmental charges are now being investigated against the policeman, a reservist.</p>
<p>The charges are for unbecoming conduct and excessive use of force towards the rape suspect. The police chief's office said that if proven, the policeman could also face criminal action.</p>
