<p>Japan's trade surplus plunged by nearly a third last year, but the latest monthly figures show an increase in the surplus with the United States, a sign of a shifting trend due to the weaker yen.</p>
<p>Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus fell 32.4 percent to 6.74 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) in 1996, the fourth consecutive year of decline, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The surplus with the United States, which has been a source of trade friction, declined 16.5 percent to 3.55 trillion yen ($29.8 billion).</p>
<p>But the figures for December alone showed the surplus with the United States rising again. It climbed 7.8 percent from a year earlier to 389.11 billion yen ($3.26 billion).</p>
<p>The overall surplus in December fell 20.6 percent from a year earlier to 881.48 billion yen ($7.40 billion).</p>
<p>Satoshi Shimamoto, a senior economist at MMS International in Tokyo, said he thought the trade surplus would continue to decline for the time being but added that the trend was starting to change as the surplus with the United States was rising due to stronger vehicle exports.</p>
<p>&quot;That is really the key kind of signal, showing a change in the trend, because the weaker yen will really accelerate automobile exports to the U.S.,&quot; Shimamoto said.</p>
<p>After hitting a record high of 79.75 to the dollar in April 1995, the yen has steadily followed a downward path, hitting a new 47-month low of 119.45 yen on Thursday.</p>
<p>The weaker yen makes Japanese exports more competitive and pushes up the prices of imports.</p>
<p>&quot;The weak yen has kept and will keep Japan's trade surplus from falling sharply. It is likely that the speed of the decline in Japan's trade surplus will slow down in the near future. It is even possible the surplus will start to increase,&quot; said Dai Hakozaki, an economist at Sanwa Research Institute.</p>
<p>A Finance Ministry official told reporters that the trade surplus was still on a declining trend, as growth in imports continued to exceed that of exports.</p>
<p>He said the rise in car exports would continue for a while and was a reaction to last year's low levels.</p>
<p>Other economists supported the government's view that the impact of the weaker yen on trade figures had lessened due to structural changes, such as Japanese manufacturers shifting of production centres abroad in search of cheap labour costs and measures to reduce the impact of currency moves.</p>
<p>Kyohei Morita, an economist at Nomura Research Institute, said the flow of finished goods from overseas units would continue, despite the weaker yen. Economists said such imports would boost the value of nominal imports as the weaker yen would push up prices while sales remained strong.</p>
<p>Economists also said that Japanese consumers have developed a taste for foreign products and would continue to buy them even if prices rise.</p>
<p>Morita and some other economists said that while Japanese exports may gain a competitive edge with the weakness of the yen, an expected slowdown in U.S. and Asian economies may dampen the export drive.</p>
<p>&quot;I think trade with the United States will continue to fall in the future. Currency moves do not have a major impact on trade with the U.S. as most Japanese car makers have already switched to local production,&quot; Morita said.</p>
