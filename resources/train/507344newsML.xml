<p>General Motors Corp, which reported income from continuing operations rose to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 1997, said on Monday its North American operations had their best performance in 10 years, demonstrating that the trend of improved earnings for General Motors is continuing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear that we are moving in the right direction to further strengthen the corporation's financial performance,&quot; GM chairman and chief executive John Smith said in a statement.  </p>
<p>GM reported its 1997 first quarter earnings from continuing operations rose to $1.8 billion or $2.30 a share from $800 million or $0.93 in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;GM North American Operations' (NAO) net income of $764 million in the first quarter of 1997 is the best performance for any quarter in more than a decade,&quot; Smith said.  &quot;This is a clear indication that GM-NAO has regained its basic earning power, continues to build financial strength and is establishing an excellent foundation for the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>GM-NAO had reported a net loss of $279 million in the first quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>GM-NAO's net-profit margin was 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 1997, compared with a net-loss margin of 1.3 percent in the prior-year period, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;The improved results were driven primarily by the many new models introduced into the marketplace, which are less costly to produce than those they replaced, by continued material-cost reductions, and production efficiencies,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>GM said vehicle deliveries in the United States in the first quarter of 1997 totaled 1,123,000 units, which resulted in a 30.2-percent share of the U.S. vehicle market.  </p>
<p>This compares with 1,152,000 units and a 31.2-percent U.S. market share in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>GM International Operations reported net income of $317 million for the first quarter of 1997, compared with net income of $432 million in the same period of 1996, and its  net profit margin was 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 1997, compared with 4.8 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>GM's European automotive operations had first quarter net income of $149 million, down from $285 million a year ago. The 1997 first quarter results included a $55-million after-tax gain related to an agreement with Volkswagen AG.  </p>
<p>&quot;The lower (European) earnings in the first quarter of 1997 were primarily due to reduced volume and higher sales incentives across Europe under intensely competitive market conditions, coupled with lower equity earnings, primarily from Saab as they await the release of their new 9-5 models later in the year,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>For the remainder of GM International Operations, which include the Latin American and Asia and Pacific Operations, net income totaled $168 million in the first quarter of 1997, compared with $147 million in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>GM International volume totaled 788,000 unit deliveries in the first quarter of 1997, resulting in an 8.4-percent market share, compared with first-quarter-1996 deliveries of 807,000 units and a market share of 8.9 percent.</p>
