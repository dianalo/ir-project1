<p>The Muscat Securities Market (MSM) is moving to prevent widespread proxy share-buying and other irregularities in its booming primary issue market, its executive president Mahmoud al-Jarwani said.</p>
<p>&quot;New measures taken by the exchange limit subscription by any individual investor to a maximum of 10 percent of the shares in a public offer,&quot; Jarwani said in an interview published by al-Watan daily on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the 10 percent ceiling includes the investor, his family members below the age of 18 and his individual business establishments, but it could be increased if the offer was undersubscribed.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) last month told commercial banks that customers seeking loans to fund share purchases on the primary issue market must deposit a sum with them equal to at least 50 percent of the intended subscription.</p>
<p>Analysts said bank loans led to heavy oversubscription of all of more than 12 IPOs in Oman this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of such measures is to widen shareholders' base and offer the opportunity of share ownership to as many nationals as possible,&quot; Jarwani said.</p>
<p>MSM, which has more than 100 stocks and is capitalised at $5 billion, has risen a hefty 60 percent so far this year.</p>
<p>Oman is the Gulf's most open economy with many listed firms allowing 49 percent ownership of their stock.</p>
