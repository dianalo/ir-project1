<p>--------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - June 10 ------------------</p>
<p>*Offshore range roughly US$0.7590/7624</p>
<p>*AUD finely balanced after an indecisive holiday session Monday saw it sidelined by US$/yen and US markets in general</p>
<p>*Offers thick above $0.7620 with New York investment houses selling, as they have for some time, and Tokyo dumping AUD/yen</p>
<p>*But chart watchers still see scope for squeeze to $0.7680</p>
<p>*ANZ job ads data today will offer clue on May labour report  </p>
<p>By 8.15 am (2215 GMT) the local currency was poised at US$0.7615/20 having wandered between US$0.7590 and US$0.7624 through Monday's holiday hit session.</p>
<p>It finished here Friday at US$0.7591/96 but made a brief foray higher offshore to touch a US$0.7645 high after the U.S. Treasury market rallied in the hope the Federal Reserve would not have to hike at its July 2-3 meeting. The relief followed May U.S. jobs data which showed a slowdown in employment growth for the month and a surprising lack of wage pressure.</p>
<p>Analysts harboured doubts, saying it was hard to argue the labour market was not tight with unemployment at 23 year lows.  </p>
<p>In any case, a lessening in the chance of a Fed hike was not necessarily bullish for the A$ since it could make the Reserve Bank more comfortable about cutting domestic rates again.</p>
<p>The last easing had been aggressive enough to convince many the bank was confident enough about low inflation and concerned enough about high unemployment to cut by whatever necessary to ensure 4.0 percent-plus growth.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of economists on Friday showed the market itself was not certain that goal could be reached with 13 of 25 economists predicting GDP growth of less than 4.0 percent in 1997/98.  </p>
<p>Such uncertainty implied there was scope for the RBA to take out further insurance on the recovery and analysts expected it to be watching for any weakness in upcoming data for a trigger.</p>
<p>Today's ANZ job advertisement data are seen as a reliable guide to employment trends a few months down the track, but are overshadowed by the unemployment figures for May due Thursday. Median forecasts are for a moderate 15,000 rise in jobs but go as low as a 5,000 fall.</p>
<p>Housing finance data Wednesday, however, should show strong growth in April and provide temporary relief for the dollar.</p>
