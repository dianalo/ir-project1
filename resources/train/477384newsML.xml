<p>Arab ministers, exasperated by a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, have agreed to tighten the screws on Israel in the hope that political and economic isolation will change Israeli policy in Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers agreed on Sunday night to recommend that their countries suspend normal ties with the Jewish state, restore the economic boycott, close down Israeli missions and withdraw from multilateral peace talks.</p>
<p>The ministers met again on Monday for a formal endorsement of their resolutions and diplomats said the two-day meeting might continue into an afternoon session.</p>
<p>The Arab League has not yet released the final text of the resolutions but, as described by some of the ministers, they are the most decisive concerted action the Arabs have taken since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power last June.</p>
<p>The effect will be somewhat diluted because states which have formal agreements with Israel -- Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians -- are not required to enforce them.</p>
<p>Israel quickly dismissed the Arab campaign as absurd.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal neighbourly relations and regional co-operation are supposed to be an asset and a common interest for all countries in this region,&quot; said Foreign Ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor.</p>
<p>&quot;It is absurd that they are being deemed as a whip, so to speak, to be used against Israel whenever there is a crisis in the peace process,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Longstanding Arab opponents of contacts with Israel quietly celebrated the victory of their policy over that of states which once argued that talking to the Israelis might help change Israeli attitudes.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision was necessary...and it is wise,&quot; said Foreign Minister Faris Bouez of Lebanon, which has long backed the Syrian position that normalisation with Israel was premature.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a clear message to Israel that continuing to deal with the peace process on this basis will destroy the peace process,&quot; the minister added. &quot;It is a clear message to the United States asking them to return to the principles of the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara was visibly jubilant on Sunday night after the ministers took the decision, which was mainly a response to the Israeli government's decision to go ahead with a settlement at Har Homa or Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>Palestinians throwing stones have clashed with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza since Netanyahu sent in bulldzoers to break ground at the settelement on March 18. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians are close to collapse.</p>
<p>On Monday Shara said he was confident Arab states would comply and predicted it would damage the domestic standing of Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have to follow because this is an instruction given by the Arab summit which was held in Cairo in June 1996... It will be implemented, I am sure of that,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to exert some influence on the Israelis as public opinion and then on the Israelis as a government, because public opinion in Israel will say 'Look what Netanyahu has done',&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Farouk Kaddoumi, the hardline head of the PLO's political (foreign affairs) department, said the message to the Israelis was that their practices have destroyed the peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to take action...because they (the Israelis) have not committed themselves to the obligations they have already undertaken,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Even Oman, the only Gulf state to open an office in Israel, said it would comply with the resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;It is for the Israelis now to decide whether they need normalisation with the Arabs,&quot; said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah.</p>
<p>The choice Israel faced was to stop building Jewish settlement or to continue with what he called &quot;their own brazen policy&quot;, the minister added.</p>
<p>Some Arab diplomats said two Arab states had reservations about the resolution but, given the angry mood in the Arab world, no ministers spoke in public against the consensus.</p>
