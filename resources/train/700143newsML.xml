<p>The European Court of Human Rights upheld on Tuesday Turkey's forced retirement of an army officer accused of Islamic fundamentalist beliefs, ruling that the move did not violate his religious freedom.</p>
<p>General Faruk Kalac, a military judge serving in the air force with the rank of captain, was forced to retire by Turkey's Supreme Military Council in August 1990 for what were considered unlawful fundamentalist opinions.</p>
<p>The president and the prime minister approved the order.</p>
<p>Kalac, now 58, appealed to the army's highest administrative court which ruled in 1991 that decisions by the Military Council were not subject to review.</p>
<p>The following year it definitively dismissed Kalac's demand that the retirement order be repealed.</p>
<p>He applied in 1992 to the European Commission of Human Rights, which screens cases for the European Court of Human Rights. The commission expressed the opinion that Turkey had breached Kalac's basic freedoms.</p>
<p>Although commission opinions are not binding, the European rights court typically gives great weight to its judgments.</p>
<p>However in this case, the rights court ruled that Kalac, in choosing to pursue a military career, had accepted the principle that military discipline might entail limitations on his rights and freedoms that could not be imposed on civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;States were at liberty to adopt for their armies disciplinary regulations forbidding this or that type of conduct, in particular an attitude inimical to an established order reflecting the requirements of military service,&quot; the court ruled.</p>
