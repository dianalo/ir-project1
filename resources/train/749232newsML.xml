<headline>Israel's Levy slams Netanyahu-backed Golan law.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-07-24</dateline>

<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, taking issue with the hardline stance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has attacked as &quot;unwise&quot; a legislative bid to quash future attempts to trade the Golan Heights for peace.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Israel's parliament took a preliminary step towards passing a law which opposition members said would make it virtually impossible to cede parts of the Israeli-held Golan to Syria in a peace agreement.</p>
<p>In a statement dictated to Israeli reporters covering Levy's visit to Brussels, the foreign minister said he was &quot;surprised by this parliamentary initiative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is an unwise proposal,&quot; said Levy, a relative moderate in Netanyahu's rightist-religious coalition.</p>
<p>Levy said the bill could cause damage to Israel, and &quot;is liable to be exploited by elements abroad who try by any and all means to sow doubt as to Israel's intentions for peace.&quot;</p>
<p>The legislation, which passed a preliminary reading by a vote of 43-40, would make approval of territorial concessions on the Golan conditional on the support of at least 80 legislators in the 120-seat Knesset.</p>
<p>Three more readings are required before the bill becomes law.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour party lawmaker Haim Ramon said of the proposal: &quot;This means the government of Israel cannot conduct negotiations with Syria. This will lead to a greater break with Syria, I think to greater deterioration.&quot;</p>
<p>The last peace talks between Israel and Syria were held more than a year ago under the previous Israeli government led by the Labour party.</p>
<p>Syria demands the full return of the Golan Heights, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel's previous Labour government said the scope of any pullback on the strategic plateau would match the depth of the peace achieved.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who cast his vote for the measure proposed by the nationalist Tsomet party, said it should not alarm anyone.</p>
<p>&quot;Every decision on a peace settlement with Syria that has any sort of territorial component, a decision like that has to come to the people for their decision,&quot; Netanyahu said, implying the parliament vote held little meaning.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who is on record opposing territorial compromise on the Golan, was echoing the policy of the dovish government he ousted in elections a year ago which had pledged to bring any final deal with Syria to public referendum. &quot;I can only express sorrow over this initiative, and the support for it, and I hope the way will be found to prevent the damage,&quot; Levy said. He added he would discuss the issue with Netanyahu after his return to Israel on Thursday.</p>
<p>Israel extended its laws to the Golan in 1981 in a move not recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>While in Belgium, Levy held talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in hopes of easing a crisis in the Israeli-PLO peace process.</p>
