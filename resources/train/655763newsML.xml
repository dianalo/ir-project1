<p>NWE gasoline prices ended steady to slightly higher on the back of continued tightness in barges and steady futures prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges finished in a wide range between $188 and $192 fob ARA with some very prompt interest for Rotterdam refinery barrels at higher levels, near $193 to $195, they said. Regular unleaded found sellers at $184 fob ARA, down about $2 from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Premium unleaded cargoes were assessed at $183-$184 fob and $193-$195 cif, traders said, in little discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should not take too seriously (those higher numbers),&quot; a barge trader in Germany said. &quot;It's obviously very specific and does not fit into the real market.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that despite a closed arbitrage to the States, there were very few prompt cargoes on offer in Northwest Europe, with sellers looking to the end of June and early July.</p>
<p>&quot;After this tremendous fall within three or four working days, it was time really for it to hold,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not improving but it's not going down either.&quot;</p>
