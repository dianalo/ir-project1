<p>South African police arrested an 18-year-old man on Wednesday in connection with twin bomb blasts on Christmas Eve that killed four people and wounded about 60.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said the man was the third suspect to be arrested in connection with the bombing in the small farming town of Worcester, north-east of Cape Town, which was claimed by a little-known far-right group.</p>
<p>Two other men in custody for the attack have previously been convicted of murder for planting bombs killing 20 people on the eve of South Africa's first all-race election in April 1994.</p>
<p>The men, members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement, escaped from jail during their trial last year and were convicted and sentenced in absentia.</p>
<p>One of the two was captured this month in a camouflaged camp he had set up on a farm in the sparsely populated, semi-arid Karoo region in the South African interior.</p>
<p>He and his wife were living in a tented camp with solar power panels, running water from a spring and a vegetable garden.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said police were searching for the white man who had leased the farm, Johan van der Westhuizen, leader of a religious cult known as the Israelites. The cult believes blacks are an inferior race on the level of animals.</p>
