<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were steady to higher in thin trade with most traders sidelined before today's issue of the U.S January consumer price index, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The consumer price index for January is forecast to be unchanged from December's 0.3 percent increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates were steady to higher again on some position adjustments. There's no fresh news and most people are sitting on the sidelines. But some people are waiting for possible direction from today's issue of the (U.S. January) consumer price index,&quot; a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The numbers have been built into the market and most people have squared or are squaring their positions, so I don't think there will be much impact,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In short dates, Wednesday/Thursday and Thursday/Friday rose 1/16 percentage point each to a common 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent, respectively. Week-fixed was unchanged from Tuesday's 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent.</p>
<p>Among term rates, one-month was unchanged from Tuesday's 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent, three-months unchanged at 5-1/2 5-3/8, nine-months unchanged at 5-5/8 5-1/2 and twelve-months unchanged at 5-3/4 5-5/8 percent. - P. Theseira (65-870-3085)</p>
