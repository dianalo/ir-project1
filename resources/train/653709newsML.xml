<p>Thousands of German police, firemen and other government employees marched on Bonn for the second day on Wednesday to protest against budget cuts.</p>
<p>Bonn police patrolling the demonstration said up to 9,000 protesters had come from across Germany to rally against the savings measures with which Finance Minister Theo Waigel is struggling to qualify for Europe's planned single currency, the euro.</p>
<p>Uniformed police officers and fire-fighters led the march, blocking roads into the centre of Bonn, waving banners blowing whistles, sounding sirens, and chanting anti-government slogans.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut The Fire Service And You Play With Fire&quot; read one banner. &quot;Waigel Needs Money -- So Do We,&quot; read another.</p>
<p>Another banner had holes cut in it, symbolising a shortfall of at least 19 billion marks in Waigel's 1997 budget, with the words &quot;Pensions&quot; and &quot;Police&quot; taped over the gaps.</p>
<p>&quot;The police hardly ever demonstrate. But we want to protest against government cuts,&quot; said Ralf Duder, a police officer in Bonn for 15 years.</p>
<p>The marchers' protest was primarily directed against government proposals to raise the retirement age for police and fire fighters from 60 to 61.</p>
<p>But they were also protesting against suggestions made by leaders in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition government on cutting pay for night and weekend shifts as well as reducing bonus compensation for dangerous assignments.</p>
<p>&quot;It is intolerable that the federal government wants to make drastic savings to the public sector to fill new budget holes,&quot; Peter Blechschmidt, board member for the OeTV public sector union told the rally in a square in the centre of Bonn.</p>
<p>&quot;The government wants to starve the state until only a skeleton remains,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small group of protesters gathered opposite Kohl's office to collect signatures for a petition calling for the veteran chancellor to resign.</p>
<p>About 5,000 police, firemen and other civil servants from a different public sector union had marched through Bonn's government quarter on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Soaring unemployment and lower-than-expected tax revenues opened up a gaping hole in the 1997 budget, putting pressure on Bonn to find ways to save money and balance the books so that Germany can qualify for European monetary union.</p>
