<p>European Union finance ministers struggled on Sunday to solve a burgeoning row over how the single currency should be managed and meet French demands for action to fight the bloc's huge unemployment lines.</p>
<p>The ministers effectively kicked off a two-day EU summit with a dinner dedicated to smoothing over the dispute, which has angered France's partners and unsettled financial markets.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Dutch presidency said the ministers were not expected to reach agreement on Sunday but were considering a number of options for ending the dipute at the meeting of EU leaders on Monday, or possibly even Tuesday.</p>
<p>Luxembourg, which takes over as EU president on July 1 said one element being considered was for the bloc to hold a special summit on unemployment in October.</p>
<p>A &quot;jobs summit&quot; was being seen by officials on the sidelines of the meeting as a way of acknowledging the demands of the new French left-wing government without making immediate promises to commit funds to job creation programmes.</p>
<p>France horrified its partners last week when it stopped routine agreement of the so-called stability pact, a framework agreed provisionally in December for keeping budget deficits from ballooning after economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>New French premier Lionel Jospin has told his partners he is hostile to the economic austerity required to qualify for EMU and more emphasis placed on creating jobs. He is also advocating more political control over the currency.</p>
<p>This has driven a wedge between Germany and France, the twin engines behind the EU's ambitious single currency project.</p>
<p>Germany has ruled out costly Europe-wide job-creation schemes, casting a pall over the meeting which was supposed to finalise a new treaty paving the way for enlargement and signalling a new Citizens' Europe.</p>
<p>Bonn vehemently opposes any weakening of the single currency criteria and any job creation schemes which involve pumping huge sums of public cash into grand finance projects.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, architect of the stability pact and a staunch budgetary disciplinarian, said on arriving in The Netherlands that he would not accept new spending to meet French demands for a new focus on boosting growth and jobs.</p>
<p>He insisted, too, that a pact limiting budget deficits of countries joining the euro-zone was not negotiable.</p>
<p>&quot;The stability pact is not up for negotiation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will stick to our position that there will be no money flowing from Germany for additional jobs creation programmes,&quot; Waigel told Reuters earlier.</p>
<p>But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said jobs had now moved to the top of the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, there can be no fudging of the (EMU) convergence criteria (but) we want jobs and growth and that is going to happen with stability at the same time,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>Most officials were hopeful a pact could be reached.</p>
<p>European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy, a Frenchman, said he believed there would be an agreement on the stability pact either on Sunday or Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a will to succeed. Either tonight or tomorrow there will be a solution,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>De Silguy reaffirmed there was no question of renegotiating the contents of the stability pact limiting budget deficits under monetary union. &quot;No one has called the contents of the stability pact into question,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the aim was to find a resolution to attach to the stability pact that reinforces political coordination and steps up the fight against joblessness, but hinted this may take time.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't create jobs with a magic wand and you don't solve the problem of unemployment in Europe in 18 months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink said he expected the summit to reach agreement on the stability pact but did not rule out negotiations continuing until Tuesday.</p>
