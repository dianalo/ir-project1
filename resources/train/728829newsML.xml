<p>Brazilian inflation in June as measured by the National Consumer Prices Index (INPC) was 0.35 percent, up from 0.11 percent in May, the National Statistics Institute (IBGE) said in a statement.</p>
<p>The INPC is based on the spending of families earning up to eight minimum salaries.</p>
<p>The Wider Consumer Prices Index (IPCA), which measures the spending of families earning up to 40 minimum salaries, was up at 0.54 percent against 0.41 percent the previous month, the IBGE said.  </p>
<p>June's results mean the INPC index over the last 12 months was 5.92 percent, down from 6.95 percent in the 12 months to the end of May, while in the case of the IPCA, the 12-month index was 7.02 percent in June compared with 7.71 percent in May, the IBGE said.</p>
<p>The main sectors driving INPC inflation in June were communications, up 18.68 percent on May, root vegetables, up 10.25 percent and public transport, up 2.88 percent, the IBGE said.  </p>
<p>In the three years since the government introduced the anti-inflation Real Plan in July 1994, inflation as measured by the INPC index reached 64.31 percent in June, the IBGE said. The IPCA index is at 65.51 percent in the three years since the start of the Real Plan.</p>
<p>Housing, communications and personal services were the main sectors which drove the INPC and IPCA inflation indices in the last three years, the IBGE said. ((-- Simona de Logu, Rio de Janeiro newsroom, 5521 507 4151))</p>
