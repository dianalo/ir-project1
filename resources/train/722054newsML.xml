<p>The Czech parliament approved on Friday a government proposal for the release of some five billion crowns in proceeds from state selloffs as part of a massive flood relief programme.</p>
<p>The move comes after approval earlier in the day of the issuance of up to five billion crowns in domestic government bonds to raise emergency funds for flood relief in the eastern part of the country.  </p>
<p>Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had said on Wednesday that the government would ask for three billion crowns, but the amount was later raised, though no official explanation was given for the change.</p>
<p>The cabinet on Wednesday approved just over one billion crowns from various sources at its disposal for emergency relief in the floods which began last weekend and have become the worst this century.</p>
<p>So far the government and parliament have freed up over 12 billion crowns for flood relief.</p>
<p>The disaster has claimed at least 23 lives according to official reports published by the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes on Friday, while dozens have been reported missing in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The floods, which have also hit parts of neighbouring Poland, Slovakia and Austria, the result of torrential rains earlier this week, have forced tens of thousands out of their homes in villages, towns, and cities.</p>
<p>Damage to buildings, homes, and infrastructure is expected to be in the tens of billions of crowns.</p>
