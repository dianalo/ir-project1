<title>USA: STOCKS RETREAT AS BONDS GIVE BACK BIG GAINS.</title>
<headline>STOCKS RETREAT AS BONDS GIVE BACK BIG GAINS.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-13</dateline>

<p>Stocks gave back their strong gains in a ferocious mid-morning reversal Wednesday as the market tracked a retreat in bonds.</p>
<p>Around 11:00 a.m. EDT(/1500 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up nearly 80 points initially on a set of upbeat economic reports on producer prices and retail sales, was off 59.46 points at 7,901.38.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index was off .30 point at 1,575.94 after gaining nearly 20 points earlier.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock market shadowed the swings in Treasury bonds, where the benchmark 30-year bond was off 2/32 after soaring more than a full point at first on good news about inflation. Its yield inched up to 6.68 percent from Tuesday's close at 6.67 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The bonds could not rally in a fashion that people would have expected after very benign data,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. &quot;There appears to be a supply of paper for sale -- maybe it's the Japanese liquidating.&quot;</p>
<p>Others thought that the weak dollar was prompting European investors to lighten up on their holdings of Treasuries.</p>
<p>The dollar sank to 1.8395 German marks from 1.8630 marks in late New York trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Stocks burst into the plus column from the opening after the government reported that the Producer Price index -- one of the key gauges of inflation -- dropped unexpectedly for a record seventh month in a row in July</p>
<p>The PPI was off 0.1 percent, following an identical drop in June. Without the volatile food and energy components, wholesale prices also fell by 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 0.1 percent last month.</p>
<p>In a separate report, the Commerce Department said July retail sales were up a moderate 0.6 percent last month, reflecting a broadbased improvement in all businesses except furniture.</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters survey had expected a 0.7 percent rise in overall retail sales.</p>
<p>The reports will be among the data considered by Federal Reserve policy-makers next week when they decide whether economic growth is strong enough to require a rise in interest rates in a pre-emptive move against inflation.</p>
<p>The stock market had staggered lower over the last few sessions, with the Dow driven down 101 points on Tuesday and below the 8,000-point level for the first time in three weeks on concern that economic reports would point to accelerating growth.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the government will report on inflation at the consumer level for July, but few analysts expect any bad surprises after Wednesday's upbeat producer price data.</p>
