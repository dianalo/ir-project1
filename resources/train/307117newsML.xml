<p>U.S. stocks were seen rising on Tuesday after the release of a December report on the consumer price index and retail sales, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The CPI core was below expectations. The Street was using up 0.2 (excluding food and energy), and it came up 0.1 (percent),&quot; said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities. &quot;Everybody uses the core, so the inflation number (is the reason why) bonds are responding.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. consumer prices in December edged higher as inflation for all of 1996 rose at the fastest rate in six years, the Labor Department said.</p>
<p>The Department said the consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in December, identical with November's rise. However, with the often-volatile food and energy sector removed, the so-called core rate increased more modestly, rising only 0.1 percent after being up 0.2 percent in November.</p>
<p>Christmas shopping boosted sales at retail stores modestly during December, the Commerce Department said, as business picked up at clothing and general merchandise stores.</p>
<p>Total retail sales increased last month by 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $208.2 billion after a revised 0.2 percent decline in November. That was slightly stronger than the 0.5 percent sales gain forecast by Wall Street economists.</p>
