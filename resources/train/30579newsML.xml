<p>A favourable interest rate environment will have helped Belgian Bank Bruxelles Lambert SA (BBL) to a double digit percentage rise in first-half 1996 profit, according to a Reuter poll of analysts.</p>
<p>Analysts sampled said BBL, Belgium's third largest bank, will announce earnings in the six months to June 30 about 19 percent higher at 5.1 billion Belgian francs from 4.3 billion francs a year earlier.</p>
<p>BBL begins the sector's interim earnings season on Wednesday followed by Generale Bank and Kredietbank on September 10 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p>Most of the forecasts were made on the basis that BBL's full year 1996 profit would rise 15 percent to 10.2 billion francs.</p>
<p>Belgium's banks are known for smoothing out big changes in earnings over the whole accounting year, making interim figures hard to predict. BBL has said only its target for full year 1996 profit is about 10 billion francs, up from 8.9 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>But all analysts agreed that an improved interest margin -- the profit banks make between the interest they pay on short term deposits and interest received from longer term loans such as on government bonds -- helped the whole sector at the start of 1996. Commission and trading income also rose.</p>
<p>BBL's net interest income of 23.4 billion francs in the first half of 1995 accounted for 63 percent of gross income.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody knows that in the first six months the banks did rather well,&quot; KB Securities analyst Dirk Peeters said.</p>
<p>Peeters, one of the few analysts to provide a detailed six-monthly forecast for BBL, saw profit rising 14.4 percent to 4.92 billion francs. The bank's earnings per share (EPS) would be around 252 francs compared with a full year 1996 forecast of 517 francs, up from 473 in 1995, he said.</p>
<p>Nicholas Faes, Belgium analyst with Merrill Lynch in London, pegged the first half result also at 4.9 billion francs, thanks in part to cost cutting, and saw full year EPS at 537 francs.</p>
<p>Other analysts' forecasts for 1996 EPS ranged from 520 to 540 francs. BBL had 19,495,936 shares issued at June 30, up from 19,465,416 at December 31, 1995, and 18,917,943 at the end of 1994.</p>
<p>However, most were neutral on BBL's share, noting the interest rate environment was looking increasingly less favourable and that speculation about the bank's future died down well before the summer.</p>
<p>The bank's chief executive officer Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer sparked bank merger fever in Belgium in August 1995 when he said he wanted to conclude an alliance with another large bank by the end of 1996, when he is due to retire.</p>
<p>But the atmosphere cooled this year when it emerged that the idea of holding merger talks with Belgium's Generale Bank had been blocked by BBL shareholder, Dutch ING.</p>
<p>BBL is widely expected to announce that its current director in charge of treasury operations and products, Michel Tilmant, will succeed Cardon from January 1, 1997.</p>
