<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party on Friday reelected Wasim Sajjad to the important office of Senate (upper house) chairman for a fourth consecutive three-year term.</p>
<p>Sajjad, a veteran lawyer from the central province of Punjab, was elected in the 87-seat house by 49 to 13, beating a candidate put up by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), Masood Kausar, in a token contest.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the total 80 votes cast, mostly favouring Sajjad, were declared invalid, the official APP news agency said.</p>
<p>The office is important because a Senate chairman automatically becomes acting president when the president is out of Pakistan or dies.</p>
<p>Sajjad's victory was a foregone conclusion because of the PML's domination of the Senate.</p>
<p>The office of the deputy chairman was won by Humayun Marri, a tribal chieftain from the southwestern province of Baluchistan, as a joint candidate of the PML and its allies.</p>
