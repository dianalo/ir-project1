<p>Economic good times have not made a significant dent in the number of Americans turning up in bread lines and homeless shelters, a new report by Catholic Charities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Americans seeking help could populate another country, the report said, noting that the 10.8 million who sought social services or emergency help from Catholic Charities last year outnumbered the population of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite good times, millions of Americans continue to show up at Catholic Charities food pantries, soup kitchens, and shelters for basic survival,&quot; Fred Kammer, president of the organization, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;And many of them work,&quot; he said. &quot;In the last two years over half of those who came for emergency food or shelter were not on welfare...we are finding that a job doesn't necessarily get you out of poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>Catholic Charities USA is the nation's largest private, non-profit network of locally controlled social service agencies. Its latest report tallied services provided in 1995.</p>
<p>It said Catholic Charities provided emergency food and shelter to almost 7.2 million people in 1995 -- virtually the same number as in 1994 and half a million more than in 1993, despite nationwide economic growth in that period.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for emergency food and shelter rose steadily during the last recession, but it has not gone down after three years of recovery,&quot; Kammer said.</p>
<p>Another 3.6 million people received social services from Catholic Charities in 1995, such as day care for children, permanent housing units, and adoption services. That number was down 7 percent from 1994.</p>
<p>Private charities cannot reasonably be expected to make up for recent cutbacks in federal assistance to the poor, Kammer said. For this to happen, giving to private charities would have to more than double next year, he said, adding that was unlikely at a time when charitable giving has been declining.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Congress and the re-elected President (Clinton) must not let poor families continue to bear the brunt of efforts to balance this nation's budget,&quot; Kammer said.</p>
