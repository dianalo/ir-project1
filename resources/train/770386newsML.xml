<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - JULY 31 -------------</p>
<p>*  NYMEX crude appears well supported with the uptrend the intact and little in the way of resistance until $22.</p>
<p>*  Market leader unleaded gasoline, continued to forge ahead in ACCESS trade but is looking increasingly volatile and overbought ahead of prompt expiry at close of business today.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and products all look set to continue their current rally with support good and resistance light, but much will depend on how the tension of the expiring gasoline contract unwinds on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>Market leader NYMEX gasoline continued to forge ahead in ACCESS trade but is looking increasingly volatile and overbought ahead of the prompt expiry at the close of business today.</p>
<p>But the picture is confused with RSI's indicating room for a short term correction. The five-day RSI is at 94 percent and nine-day RSI at 87 percent while slow stochastics on September are diverging, leaving room for further gains.</p>
<p>Some analysts said that the market was showing increased volatility because of a possible squeeze on the August gasoline contract and much will depend on what happens to the Aug/Sep spread today, currently around seven cents in backwardation, as to how a correction, if any, unfolds.</p>
<p>However, good support was in place on the September gasoline chart with longer term indicators remaining neutral.</p>
<p>Leslie Nicholas at GNI Research said in his daily report, &quot;It's difficult to predict price action ahead of the expiry as usual, but standing in front of this contract would have been devastating in recent days&quot;.</p>
<p>Analysts said the spot month continuation chart showed good support around 66.95 cents after gapping higher to that level on Wednesday. To the upside it looked fairly uncluttered with 71.30 cents the first line of resistance.</p>
<p>Prices on the September chart were also forging new contract highs around 63.45 cents in ACCESS trading with similar underlying support and long term RSIs in neutral. Slow stochastics touched but are now bullishly diverging again.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude also appeared well supported with the uptrend of the past eight trading days intact.</p>
<p>There was little in the way of resistance until the $22 barrier, the level where a previous steep rally faltered.</p>
<p>&quot;(NYMEX crude) has tried $20.50 in ACCESS trade and a rally through $20.55 could open the door for further gains, though much will depend on the gasoline expiry,&quot; Nicholas said.</p>
<p>Victor Yu at Refco in New York said, &quot;The market is looking a bit toppy and is running into resistance at around $20.38 though it's holding the upside of it's $19-$20.50 range of the past two weeks&quot;.</p>
<p>On the spot month chart $20.38 forms part of an imperfect treble-top.</p>
<p>That capped off a small rally from the $18.35 low of June 20.</p>
<p>Heating oil continued to be drawn higher by gasoline's rally.</p>
<p>Weekly RSIs were well into the overbought zone but the market was well supported with a double high cross and subsequent divergence of the slow stochastics lines pointing the market higher in the longer term.</p>
