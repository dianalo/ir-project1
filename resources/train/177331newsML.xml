<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--- A survey of 448 Danish companies made for international debt-collecting firm Intrum Justitia shows that 58 percent of them have given up attempts to collect debts through the courts as the Danish legal system is too complicated and expensive.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--- Danes bought an average 50.2 kilos of frozen foods each in 1995, almost twice as much as ten years ago, but sales are expected to flatten out in 1997 after several years of strong growth.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS POSTEN</p>
<p>--- The Government has shelved its plans for a unified package of tax reforms in the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--- A Greens survey based on 1015 interviews says the ruling Centre-left coaliotin would fall to the rightist bloc if an election was to be held today, due to the government's admitted mishandling of British writer Salman Rusdie's coming visit to Denmark.</p>
