<p>The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) froze on Monday for the third straight session a rise in the share prices of Acoje Holdings Inc and Itogon-Suyoc Mines Inc.</p>
<p>The PSE surveillance department said Acoje share price was frozen in early trade at 54 centavos, a 50 percent rise from Friday's close of 36 centavos.</p>
<p>Acoje was a mining company that was recently converted into a holding company.</p>
<p>The bourse also halted any further rise in mining firm Itogon-Suyoc A shares after they reached 13.50 centavos, a 45.9 percent gain from 9.25 centavos in the previous session.</p>
<p>The bourse did not intervene in Itogon B shares, which were still below the 50 percent mark.</p>
<p>The PSE automatically freezes shares when they rise by close to 50 percent on a single day.</p>
<p>The PSE surveillance department said the two companies have yet to submit explanations regarding the share price rises.</p>
<p>An Itogon official who asked not to be named said the company is preparing a response to the bourse's query. He said the firm did not know why its shares surged.</p>
<p>Acoje has denied rumours of a foreign firm buying into the company, which traders said was the reason for the stock's rise.</p>
<p>After the bourse capped a further rise in its share price, Acoje was trading at 46 centavos, up 10 centavos or 27.78 percent from the previous close. Itogon A shares were up 2.25 centavos, or 24.32 percent, at 11.50 centavos, with volume reaching a modest 123,800.</p>
