<p>Sierra Leone's army has captured a strategic bridge near Liberia after a bloody battle with Kamajor traditional hunters opposed to the May 25 military coup, a senior army spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Major John Milton told Reuters that soldiers backed by Revolutionary United Front rebel allies, renamed the People's Army, had won control of the Mano River Union Bridge on Monday after a battle with hundreds of Kamajors.</p>
<p>Sources in the eastern regional capital Kenema said that at least 18 Kamajors had been killed and several soldiers had been seriously wounded. They spoke of unconfirmed reports of deaths among the soldiers.</p>
<p>Ousted President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah used the Kamajors as a civil militia to fight alongside the army against the rebels.</p>
<p>The military junta, which took power after the coup, accused him of derailing a peace deal he signed with the rebels in November and of humiliating the army.</p>
<p>Milton accused regional power broker Nigeria of arming the Kamajors from Liberia, where it heads a West African peacekeeping force. &quot;The Kamajors are being supplied arms and ammunition by Nigeria,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The army began its advance on the bridge with the weekend capture of Gofor and Zimmi, towns about 27 miles (40 km) away.</p>
<p>Nigeria, spearheading calls for restoration of Kabbah, has reinforced troops it had in Sierra Leone under a defence pact.</p>
<p>The Mano River Union Bridge joins Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>
