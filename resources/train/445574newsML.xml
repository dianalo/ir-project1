<p>Nationalist tensions are growing in Macedonia as its ethnic Albanians demand more autonomy and Macedonian students protest against the use of Albanian in educational programmes.</p>
<p>The ethnic Albanian mayors of Tetovo and Gostivar, where the Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDPA) party won local elections three weeks ago, are pressing for greater powers for their mostly-Albanian communities.</p>
<p>Both mayors intend to create regional financial, banking and other institutions but say their demands do not threaten Macedonia's territorial integrity.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a West European concept which does not threaten the territorial integrity of Macedonia,&quot; mayors Rufi Osmani of Gostivar and Alaydin Demiri of Tetovo said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Parliament has offered it as a model to all countries confronted with ethnic tensions,&quot; Demiri said.</p>
<p>The Macedonian authorities, who have sought to preserve the former Yugoslav republic's ethnic fabric and avoid the fate of Croatia and Bosnia, fear the plan's potential for violence.</p>
<p>Ethnic Albanians officially account for 22 percent of Macedonia's population of almost two million, according to the 1994 census. Albanians say the real proportion is closer to 40 percent.</p>
<p>Tetovo and Gostivar are on the border with Albania and any rumblings of autonomy smack of secession to Macedonian nationalists.</p>
<p>President Kiro Gligorov and Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski have condemned the move for regionalisation, aware that the reaction of Macedonian nationalists could be disastrous.</p>
<p>Some Albanians in Tetovo argue that the regionalisation has already been achieved.</p>
<p>&quot;Tetovo and Gostivar are already a homogeneous entity. What they now need are institutions,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Osmani said: &quot;The term 'parallel institutions' is being interpreted rather negatively by the Macedonian political corps&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;My opinion on the subject is different. Albanians do parallel Macedonians in almost every respect -- they embody two parallel peoples, they possess two parallel cultures, two parallel ethnic backgrounds, two parallel denominations...</p>
<p>&quot;Those two parallelisms have been functioning for decades which is why they should develop via parallel institutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the capital Skopje, thousands of Macedonian students have been protesting for the past month against a law allowing the use of the Albanian language at the Faculty of Pedagogy.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is the reaction by the students to just one law imagine what would be the reaction if regionalisation went into effect,&quot; one western observer said.</p>
<p>Diplomats note that the Albanian move for more autonomy could be shelved for the time being as their mother country plunges into anarchy.</p>
<p>&quot;All Albanian parties in Macedonia supported (Albanian President Sali) Berisha and not the rebels. Wrong move. They are cut off and without Albania's support can't make any moves. The way things stand now in Albania they will have to wait for quite some time before they do,&quot; a Western diplomat in Skopje said.</p>
