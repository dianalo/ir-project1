<p>A Malaysian businessman accused of helping fix soccer matches for a Far Eastern betting syndicate said on Tuesday he paid Dutch keeper Hans Segers 35,000 pounds ($56,120) for helping predict games.</p>
<p>Heng Suan Lim, who denies charges he paid Segers and former Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar to actually rig matches, told a court he had paid Segers for tips on the outcome of games in the Dutch league and occasionally on English league games.</p>
<p>&quot;He used to try to give me three to four winners. He is a very honest man. If he felt he didn't have the best information he wouldn't make predictions,&quot; Lim said.</p>
<p>Segers was playing for Wimbledon at the time but kept in very close contact with Dutch soccer, he added.</p>
<p>Lim passed what he had learned to wealthy Indonesian commodity trader Johannes Josef, who regularly paid large amounts of money for inside information which would help him bet in the Far East on the results of foreign matches.</p>
<p>Lim said he had only paid Grobbelaar around 9,000 pounds for the advice he had given him.</p>
<p>Lim, along with former striker John Fashanu, is accused of paying Grobbelaar to rig matches. The two men are also accused of running a similar scheme with Segers. All four deny the charges, which carry a maximum seven-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever done anything to corrupt the game?&quot; asked Lim's lawyer Jerome Lynch.</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely not. I love the game too much,&quot; Lim replied.</p>
<p>The prosecution says Lim was sent more than 500,000 pounds from various Far Eastern sources which he used to pay off members of the match-fixing ring.</p>
<p>Lim said much of the money had come from Josef, who stopped paying for information in 1994 because he was alarmed by the amount of money Lim was losing in London casinos when accompanied by business associates and guests.</p>
<p>Lim estimates his total gambling losses at around 175,000 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Josef) didn't approve of it. He's already very wealthy but I'm starting out in life,&quot; he said. &quot;I explained that I was progressing into a promising business life with the contacts I had made.&quot;</p>
<p>Lim earlier said Josef, a close family friend, had sent money to help him buy an apartment and would sometimes transfer cash even when no forecasts had been made.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Josef was my benefactor. Immaterial of whether there was soccer being played, he would give me money from time to time to build up my position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But despite the closeness of his relationship with Josef and other friends in Malaysia, Lim declined to invite them to the trial to testify on his behalf.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering the circumstances of the case I was sure they would be arrested immediately and I didn't want them to go through that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lim met Fashanu in 1990 and soon the player was providing information to be passed onto Josef, who would typically bet a total of between 40,000 pounds and 50,000 pounds on the results of four or five matches each weekend.</p>
<p>In November 1992 Fashanu introduced Lim to Grobbelaar, who seemed keen to earn money by helping forecast matches. But things did not go well at first and contacts dropped off.</p>
<p>&quot;With due respect to Bruce, some of his November and December forecasts were a disaster. He felt a bit embarrassed to call me,&quot; said Lim. ($1=.6237 Pound)</p>
