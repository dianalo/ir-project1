<p>Finnish authorities on Wednesday sought to dampen fevered speculation the country might be on the verge of joining Europe's currency stability regime, cutting key interest rates after a rise in the markka.</p>
<p>By Tuesday, the Finnish currency had firmed by about two penni against the mark in two days of heavy trade after Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen fuelled speculation a link could come this weekend. He told a newspaper the time was ripe for a decision soon.</p>
<p>The markka hit four-month highs amid speculation of an imminent link to the European Union's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), possibly in connection with this weekend's meeting of EU finance and economy ministers in Dublin.</p>
<p>Early on Wednesday the central bank, which foreign exchange dealers said had been intervening in markets to stem the markka's rise, said it was cutting 15 basis points off its key tender rate, to 3.10 percent.</p>
<p>Bank officials denied the cut had any exchange rate policy targets, but one of the reasons cited by the bank for the move was &quot;the confidence shown towards the markka&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This will in no way help (weaken the markka), they should have taken off 50 basis points at once, this sort of shaving is not enough,&quot; said OKOBANK treasury economist Teijo Rantatupa.</p>
<p>The cut proved the first in a series of official efforts on Wednesday to calm financial markets, and by the end of usual trading hours the markka had weakened slightly against the mark, to 3.0010 against 2.9975 at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The frenzy abated when officials both in Brussels and Helsinki poured cold water on talk of a link this weekend, saying there was unlikely to be time for it to be discussed.</p>
<p>Separately, Lipponen on Wednesday told a newspaper the markka's possible entry into ERM would be at a combination of its spot rate and a longer-term average.</p>
<p>&quot;A longer trend will be considered,&quot; daily Hufvudstadsbladet quoted Lipponen as saying.</p>
<p>His public comments on the timing of a decision to link the markka to the European currency grid and the possible level at which a link would start, conflict with the usually tight-lipped approach of central bank officials, who are wary of making such a move.</p>
<p>A recently updated convergence programme for monetary union showed that by 1997 Finland will meet most other criteria for joining a single currency.</p>
<p>Most experts, among them German Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, say membership of the ERM is also key to fulfilling the exchange rate stability criteria for convergence.</p>
<p>Finnish politicians like Lipponen are seeking tight links with the EU as part of a bid to ensure closer political connections with the west for Finland, which joined the Union in 1995 after 50 years in the shadow of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They are anxious to ensure that if monetary union is achieved on schedule, Finland will not be excluded because of a technicality like ERM membership.</p>
<p>But Finnish exporters fear the markka is too strong and a link now may jeopardise Finland's competitive position, particularly against its main forestry rival, Sweden, which has not yet decided on whether to join a single currency.</p>
<p>The central bank has said a link may paradoxically make the recently stable markka more volatile by inviting speculators to challenge the fluctuation limits imposed by membership of the ERM.</p>
