<p>*Australian bonds settle in firmer territory after whippy opening trade as uncertainty dominated ahead of 9.30 a.m. announcement time for any rate move.</p>
<p>*Trade has slowed, focus now on U.S. payrolls later today.  </p>
<p>Australian bonds were sitting in positive territory, having settled after a nervous start to the day as traders prepared for a possible rate cut announcement by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) at 9.30 a.m. (2330 GMT).</p>
<p>With the U.S. FOMC meeting having left rates steady overnight, there were some expectations of a cut, but some signs of an improving economy had seen others wind back expectations, and saw bonds trad reasonably wide ranges in the first hour.</p>
<p>Bonds have since traded in the middle of those early ranges, with a cut still seen as a strong possibility either later in the month or after the August 5 RBA board meeting.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the argument that the Reserve Bank would take advantage of a no move by the FOMC was fairly weak,&quot; Macquarie Bank chief economist Bill Shields said.</p>
<p>&quot;The domestic issues are the critical ones for whether we have another rate cut in Australia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bonds softened after there was no rate cut, but soon regained this ground, and were further buoyed by the National Australia bank June quarter business survey which showed conditions were still subdued and said a rate cut was likely in the next month.  </p>
<p>Immediate focus was now on the release of U.S. payrolls for June later on Thursday. The release has been brought forward from Friday because of the July 4 Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>---------------------(SPREADS)---------------------------</p>
<p> AUD VS   3-YR	   10-YR	* AUD 3-YR/10-YR SPREAD</p>
<p> USD	-29 (unch)    54 (- 04) * FUTURES  82.5  (-5.5)</p>
<p> CAD	 88 (+ 04)    74 (- 03) * CASH     109   (- 05)</p>
<p> NZD	-90 (- 10)   -03 (- 11) *</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Spreads generally narrower, although short end mixed. NZ yields rise after RBNZ said that monetary conditions had eased too far, and consequently Australian spreads to NZ narrow. Local yield curve continues to flatten as long end leads on day.</p>
