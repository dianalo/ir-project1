<title>RUSSIA: Now it's Yeltsin who sends Clinton get-well card.</title>
<headline>Now it's Yeltsin who sends Clinton get-well card.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-03-14</dateline>

<p>President Boris Yeltsin,  on the receiving end of get-well cards for much of the past eight months, planned to send a good luck telegram on Friday to U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has to undergo knee surgery.</p>
<p>Turning the tables on American surgeons who flew in for Yeltsin's heart bypass last November, a top Moscow doctor said Russian medics were ready to examine Clinton if needed.</p>
<p>&quot;If need be, our specialists are ready to give American surgeons consultative help,&quot; Vladimir Okhotinsky told Itar-Tass news agency.</p>
<p>In a land where guessing the real state of a leader's health has long been a popular pastime, Russian media were quick to raise the prospect of possible changes in plans for the two leaders to meet next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The American administration does not want to comment on the possibility of changing U.S. President Bill Clinton's travel plans to Helsinki,&quot; RIA news agency began its lead afternoon dispatch.</p>
<p>Russian Television, quoting an American spokeswoman, said Clinton was not drunk when the accident took place. Similiar denials were often heard from the Kremlin as Yeltsin's health worsened in recent years.</p>
<p>Although it was Yeltsin's turn to visit the United States for the next U.S.-Russian summit, the two countries agreed to hold the meetings in Helsinki to accommodate Yeltsin's recovery.</p>
<p>The Russian leader underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery in November and then came down with double pneumonia in January. But over the past week Yeltsin, looking trimmer and fitter after his recovery, has captured some of his old energy and spark.</p>
<p>Clinton, by contrast, was shown wincing in pain as he was transported after a late-night fall. The American leader, 50, will need to use crutches during the Helsinki summit, while Yeltsin, 66, may present a picture of relative good health.</p>
<p>His telegram to Clinton would offer his &quot;support in connection with his upcoming operation&quot;, the Kremlin said.</p>
