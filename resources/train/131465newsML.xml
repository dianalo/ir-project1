<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told cabinet ministers discussing the 1997 budget to make better use of resources and cut spending, state newspapers said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The efficient performance of the economy which is equal to defending Iraq, depends on reducing expenditure and the rational use of resources,&quot; Saddam was quoted as saying at the Sunday meeting.</p>
<p>The papers did not report any figures.</p>
<p>Iraq has been crippled by six years of trade sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. High state spending on infrastructure projects and subsidies to farmers has also fuelled inflation.</p>
<p>After Saddam last December ordered ministers to improve the economy, the government raised prices for public utilities and urged ministries to spend only funds they generated.</p>
<p>The government measures were partly meant to strengthen Iraq's battered currency.</p>
<p>The dinar slipped early this year to 3,000 against the U.S. dollar but when Iraq agreed to talks with the United Nations on an &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal the dinar surged to 450. The deal allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>However, delays in implementing the pact signed in May have weakened the dinar again. The dinar fell to 1,800 against the dollar on Monday, down from 1,500 a week ago.</p>
<p>Iraq's Central Bank early this month allowed official banks to sell hard currency for dinars in a bid to improve confidence in the dinar. It stabilised for a few days then started sinking again.</p>
