<headline>SBC Warburg says Kepit did not lose out.</headline>

<p>SBC Warburg, the investment banking unit of Swiss Bank corp, said on Wednesday it had ensured that its client, Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust (KEPIT), had not been disadvantaged as a result of a share sale executed by SBC Warburg last year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the investment bank said an internal inquiry into the 300 million pound ($478 million) share sale had led to disciplinary action being taken against staff.  </p>
<p>The spokesman said that in connection with a bid for three of KEPIT's portfolio's last October, &quot;the bank sought to sell into the market&quot; and that this had contributed to adverse price movements of the shares in the portfolios.</p>
<p>The fall in the share prices meant that KEPIT might have received less than it had expected for the sale but SBC Warburg said it had ensured that the client did not lose out -- effectively taking the loss, thought to be around the two million pounds mark, onto its own book.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg said it would co-operate fully with an investigation being carried out by the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) which confirmed on Wednesday that it is investigating the events.</p>
<p>Peter Corrigan, head of French equities at SBC Warburg, has resigned from the bank because of the affair and left the firm last Friday while another, as yet unnamed, trader has also departed. ($ = 0.629 British Pounds)</p>
