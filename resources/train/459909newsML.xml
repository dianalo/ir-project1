<title>USA: IBM stock falls after brokerages cut earnings estimates.</title>
<headline>IBM stock falls after brokerages cut earnings estimates.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of International Business Machines Corp. fell in heavy trading Friday after two Wall Street brokerages lowered earnings estimates for the world's largest computer maker.</p>
<p>The stock fell $3.75 to $132.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the fourth most-active issue at mid-afternoon with more than 4.5 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley on Friday cut its earnings estimates for IBM, saying that the Armonk, N.Y.-based company will make more money toward the end of the year instead of earlier. It also said results will be affected by currency fluctuations and the transition to a new mainframe model.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its earnings per share estimate to $2.80 from $2.97 for the second quarter and to $12.30 from $12.50 for all of 1997.</p>
<p>IBM earned $2.02 billion, or $3.93 a share, on revenues of $23.1 billion in the 1996 fourth quarter. For full-year 1996, it reported profits of $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, on revenues of $75.95 billion.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley continued to rate IBM's stock as an outperformer.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, Dean Witter also lowered its 1997 earnings estimates for IBM, saying its operating income was expected to fall by 11 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>However, this is expected to be offset by a lower tax rate of 35 percent vs. a previous 39 percent, along with IBM's current stock repurchase plan, it said.</p>
<p>Dean Witter raised its earnings estimate for the second half of the year and kept its 1997 profit estimate at $14.25 per share. It continued to recommend accumulating IBM's stock.</p>
