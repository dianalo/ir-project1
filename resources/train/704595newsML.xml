<p>The Czech Finance Ministry has taken action against a major investment institution for the second time this week, fining fund manager Prvni Investicni a.s.(PIAS) a record 10 million crowns ($308,000).</p>
<p>The ministry said in a statement on Thursday that it had levied the fine, the maximum permitted, for illegal financing operations and other activities by PIAS.</p>
<p>&quot;Violations of the law on investment companies and investment funds were found on the basis of a probe of investment funds and unit trusts managed by (PIAS),&quot; a ministry statement said.</p>
<p>PIAS, more than 80 percent owned by the bank IPB, is the largest Czech investment fund manager, controlling holdings through its funds of some 30 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The ministry said in the statement that it had ordered changes in the management of PIAS, and said it must change &quot;its depositors for its unit trusts and investment funds&quot;, which is currently IPB.</p>
<p>This means PIAS must cancel the contract under which it appointed IPB its broker.</p>
<p>&quot;(This) concerns mainly violations of the rules of securities trading, performing operations having the character of forbidden credit extension, and failing to adhere to the legal limits of holding of securities which are not publicly tradeable,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Officials at PIAS were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Many partaicipants in Prague's equity markets have criticised the Finance Ministry for failing to control the activities of investment funds, which control major stakes in all industrial sectors, during the coupon privatisation of formerly state-owned companies.</p>
<p>The Prague market has consistently underperformed other post-communist markets in the region.</p>
<p>In recent months, the authorities have taken several steps to revive investor confidence. Both Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and his deputy, Vladimir Rudlovcak, resigned under heavy criticism of their management of the capital markets.</p>
<p>More recently, the ministry announced that as of Wednesday it was imposing forced administration on investment firm O.B. Invest, a unit of the state-controlled Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (CSOB), because of repeated violations of financial laws.</p>
<p>It said the violations were linked with OB Invest's management of the funds Zlaty Investicni Fond Kvanto a.s., and Kvanto Investicni Privatizacni Fond a.s., which had broken rules governing trading in securities.</p>
<p>It said the violations involved buying a company's shares at an &quot;overvalued price&quot; and selling them at an &quot;undervalued price&quot;, and to conducting operations &quot;having a character of forbidden lending which does not hold to lawfully permitted limits&quot;.</p>
