<p>Kazakhstan's government has appointed Nurlan Kapparov new chairman of the recently-formed state pipeline company Kazakhnefteprovod, a government official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In line with a government order, Nurlan Kapparov is appointed head of the national pipeline company, replacing in this function Kaynulla Kasenov,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>He declined to give any official reasons for the replacement of Kasenov, 39, who had won respect among oil and gas workers for knowledge and experience gained from nearly two decades of work on Russian and Kazakh gas fields.</p>
<p>Kasenov was appointed chairman of Kazakhnefteprovod shortly after the company's establishment in April.</p>
<p>Kapparov, a successful businessman aged just 27, graduated from the Technological Institute in the Kazakh capital Almaty. Before his appointment, he headed trade corporation Accept, whose interests ranged from vodka to oil products and grain.</p>
<p>Kazakhnefteprovod is a 100-percent state-run company set up &quot;to observe Kazakhstan's economic interests in transporting and exporting crude oil and oil products.&quot;</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, a resource-rich country five times the size of France and with a population of just 16.7 million people, has proven crude oil reserves estimated in billions of tonnes.</p>
<p>The pipeline company manages 6,300 km (3,900 miles) of oil pipelines, 977 km (600 miles) of oil products pipelines and 3,400 km (2,100 miles) of water pipelines.</p>
<p>Kazakhnefteprovod inherited the assets of state-run Yuzhnefteprovod oil pipeline company, with pipelines running across the Central Asian state's giant Mangistau, Uzen and Tengiz oil fields.</p>
<p>It also manages the Shymkent-Pavlodar-Omsk network stretching from south to north and will operate two oil products pipelines in the north.</p>
<p>The company's management has said Kazakhnefteprovod needs at least $500 million of investment in the next three years for modernising existing pipeleines and building new ones.</p>
