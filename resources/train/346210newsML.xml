<p>The Zambian government said on Friday it would seek a 5.5 percent growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997, after a 6.4 percent growth in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thrust of this year's economic policy is a 5.5 percent growth in real GDP, while maintaining macro-economic stability,&quot; finance minister Ronald Penza said in his 1997 budget speech.</p>
<p>Penza said he expected inflation to drop to 15 percent by the end of the year from 35 percent recorded at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, government spending will be focused on those areas that support growth. In this regard, it will be necessary to run an overall budget surplus of about one percent of GDP,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Government spending would be focused on the road rehabilitation programme, which would be allocated 30 billion kwacha ($22.7 million), agriculture and to the provision of social services.</p>
<p>&quot;To maintain macro-economic stablity and to achieve the inflation target, it will be important to maintain a tight fiscal and monetary stance,&quot; Penza said.</p>
<p>He said broad money growth would have to be kept within the expected real GDP growth and the inflation target.</p>
<p>Penza said the public sector reform programme, which was suspended last year for lack of finances, would be speeded up this year to reduce the government's wage bill.</p>
<p>He said the government would encourage public servants to opt for retirement.</p>
<p>He said the 6.4 percent growth registered in 1996 came from agriculture (28.7 percent), mining (12.2 percent), manufacturing (2.5 percent), tourism (17.7 percent) commerce and trade (13 percent) and non-traditional exports (23 percent).</p>
