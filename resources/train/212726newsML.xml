<p>Britain's Conservatives, defending a slim one-seat majority in parliament, on Sunday sought to defuse a row over Europe that has reopened old party wounds.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party, opinion poll favourites to win the next general election, accused the government of a cover-up after a press report that it withheld vital documents from parliament on monetary union.</p>
<p>The timing could not be worse as Finance Minister Kenneth Clarke is set to present on Tuesday what he hopes will be a vote-winning budget to claw back Labour's sizeable poll lead before the election, due by next May.</p>
<p>But Labour finance spokesman Gordon Brown shied away from saying that it would force a parliamentary confidence vote which could spark an early election. &quot;The government is descending into confusion,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Major, whose six years in power have been dogged by party mutinies over Britain's role in the European Union, now faces renewed party revolt over demands for a parliamentary debate on the thorny issue of a single currency.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times newspaper added fuel to the political fire by alleging that crucial documents about the preparations for a single European currency had been kept from members of parliament</p>
<p>The paper said four documents, including reports from the British Treasury and the European Monetary Institute, revealed that Brussels would interfere in Britain's economic policy even if it opted out of the single currency, the euro.</p>
<p>The reports were said to suggest that the pound sterling will need to shadow the euro even if it does not enter a new exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>Leading Conservatives took to the airwaves on Sunday to calm party nerves, with Treasury Minister Philip Oppenheimer insisting the press report was misleading.</p>
<p>&quot;The British government will oppose and veto any proposals that will fine us for not joining or shadowing EMU,&quot; he told BBC Television.</p>
<p>&quot;Any decision to go into EMU would have to be debated in parliament again. And the British people would have the final say in a referendum,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth repeated an assurance from Chancellor of the Exchequer Clarke that there would be no binding decisions at two meetings of European ministers next month until MPs were satisfied scrutiny had taken place.</p>
<p>Eurosceptics in the deeply divided Conservative Party argue that Brussels is bent on destroying Britain's national sovereignty in a United States of Europe.</p>
