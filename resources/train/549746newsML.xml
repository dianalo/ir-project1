<p>Plans for a mid-year float of shares in the Formula One Grand Prix motor racing business on the London and New York stock exchanges are likely to be stalled, Britain's Independent newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Formula One's multi-millionaire owner Bernie Ecclestone had postponed flotation plans and had instructed his advisers to examine the alternative of a private sale.</p>
<p>There were also doubts about the 2.5 billion stg ($4.1 billion) price tag put on Formula One's business when news of a planned flotation appeared two months ago, the Independent said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sale, if it happens, is expected to put a significantly lower value on Formula One,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Ecclestone, one of Britain's richest men, is expected to retain his controlling stake in Formula One if a private sale takes place.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur, president of the Formula One Constructors' Association and owner of the sport's promotion arm, has transformed motor racing into a spectacular event attracting a 450 million global television audience for each of the 16 Grand Prix events.</p>
<p>The Independent said flotation plans had encountered problems over timing and fierce resistance from some constructors.</p>
<p>These constructors were thought to be insisting they should emerge with the bulk of the share after the float, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>A large number of interested parties, ranging from media companies to wealthy individuals, have expressed an interest in buying a stake in Formula One.</p>
