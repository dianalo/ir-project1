<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual vowed on Sunday that general elections would be held early next year as part of a pact aimed at ending the nation's crisis and bloodshed.</p>
<p>He offered clemency to &quot;mistaken&quot; Moslem fundamentalists whose anger at being thwarted in a similar poll five years ago plunged the North African country into violence.</p>
<p>But he warned that the state could not &quot;tolerate practises of criminal hatred and savagery...whose defeat Algeria has irrevocably sealed&quot;.</p>
<p>Zeroual made his pledge in a speech on state-run television as he closed a &quot;National Conference of Understanding&quot;. The meeting, swamped in heavy security underlining the fear of possible violence, was boycotted by main opposition parties.</p>
<p>The once-powerful Islamist party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which took a huge lead in a parliamentary poll scrapped by the authorities in 1992, was barred. An estimated 50,000 people have been killed in the ensuing violence.</p>
<p>Before Zeroual spoke, 38 party, union and other leaders signed a pact to pave the way for a multi-party system and Zeroual's plan for the elections.</p>
<p>Zeroual is a former general appointed as president in January 1994 and confirmed in his post in elections for which more than 100,000 security forces were deployed last November.</p>
<p>He reiterated his promise of a constitutional referendum this year to bar the use of religion and language as political weapons, and said local elections would be held in 1997.</p>
<p>Legal Islamic parties -- Hamas and Ennahda -- will be given a year to change their founding principles to take religious promises from their basic platforms. The plans do not mention FIS as it is outlawed.</p>
<p>The conference had given a clear message, Zeroual said, to &quot;all those who still nourish hateful visions towards Algeria...and those led blindly by aberration and despair into a vain and suicidal adventure against their homeland.&quot;</p>
<p>But outside the seaside complex of Palais des Nations, 20 km (12 miles) from Algiers, where 1,000 politicians held the two-day meeting, other politicians and analysts questioned the impact of the conference.</p>
<p>Some said they doubted the pact would end violence, reunite Algeria and end political conflict. And at least in the short term, Algiers residents remained indifferent.</p>
<p>&quot;We have heard of talks to resolve the crisis so many times before,&quot; said one resident summing up the mood of a population tired by killings, economic hardship and the endless squabbles.</p>
<p>Many of those signing the pact are seen as lacking strong grassroots support, except for the legal Islamist Hamas leader Mahfoud Nahnah, who took more than 2.9 million votes in last year's presidential poll, and Boualem Benhamouda, head of the former ruling National Liberation Front (FLN).</p>
<p>The pact, which bans use of Islam, Arabic and Berber languages as political weapons to win power, condemns violence and lays the framework for a multi-party democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;The final text...will have no impact in a balanced evolution of the society because of lack of thorough debate and the lack of maturity in its solutions,&quot; former prime minister Mouloud Hamrouche, a leading figure of the FLN, said in a letter to Zeroual published on Sunday.</p>
<p>Zeroual, however, said the conference had opened a new era and he called on boycotting parties to join in rebuilding Algeria.</p>
<p>To Algeria's &quot;mistaken children&quot; -- many of whom, officials say have been driven to fundamentalist ranks by despair and poverty -- Zeroual said Algeria had held out &quot;the generous hand of guaranteed clemency.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This hand remains still extended and it is up to them to know how to seize it.&quot;</p>
