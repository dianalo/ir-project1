<p>NWE oil products were steady on Friday morning with the market pausing for breath, except prompt gasoline which continued its relentless rise, dealers said.</p>
<p>Eurograde gasoline barges were quoted at $202/$204 fob Rotterdam for balance of July delivery. One barge sold at $202 late on Thursday. The buyer at the time was again seeking prompt barrels. The prompt-first half August spread widened to almost $7 with a barge for next month trading at $196.50 fob AR.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were little changed as IPE August gas oil futures hovered from unchanged to 50 cents weaker. Prompt deliveries were again offered at IPE August +50 cents fob Rotterdam. Offers for first half August loadings were at +75 cents/+$1.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil barge offers originally rose 50 cents/$1 a tonne before returning to Thursday's range of $90.50 for prompt and $91.50 for first half August. Barges traded at $91 fob Rotterdam and $90.50-$90.75 for lower grade RMG.</p>
<p>Bunker market demand was low after healthy volumes on Thursday.</p>
