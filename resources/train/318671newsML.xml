<p>Mongolia's largest copper firm Erdenet Concern will receive $3.5 million in compensation from a Russian energy plant for power outages that cut production at the mine, the official Government News newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>Erdenet, which Mongolia jointly runs with Russia, and the Irkutskenergo Power Plant had agreed on the payment to cover losses stemming from the power plant's failure to provide the mine with electricity as contracted, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>A Russian court had also ordered the Irkutsk-based Vega Co to pay Erdenet $682,000 for a shipment of copper concentrate, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>In addition, Russian oil firm Neman Co would ship 5,000-6,000 tonnes of oil to Erdenet, which had paid $4.6 million to the company for the petroleum but had yet to receive the goods, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper gave no further details. Officials at the Russian companies were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Mongolia would later this year launch a joint venture copper firm with the U.S. at the Erdenet mine, it said.</p>
<p>Output of the new Erdmin Co was expected to be 3,000-3,600 tonnes of copper a year, the newspaper said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Erdenet had recently signed contracts to sell copper concentrate to several Russian refineries this year, it said but did not elaborate on the deals.</p>
<p>Mongolia exported 486,100 tonnes of copper concentrate in 1996, most of it to Russia, official figures show.</p>
