<p>Wheat and rice will hold the Indian commodity trade's focus as the government tries to ensure enough supplies of foodgrains at cheaper prices, traders said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a gap between demand and supply in foodgrains,&quot; said Mulraj Tanna of commodities traders Jamnadas Madhavji International Ltd.</p>
<p>But, sizeable state purchases from farmers following a good summer wheat harvest may mean the government will import less than an initially planned two million tonnes for 1997/98 (April-March), government officials said.</p>
<p>State agencies are expected to buy about 11.1 million tonnes from farmers in 1997/98 against 8.2 million last year, they said.</p>
<p>The government buys wheat from farmers to build up buffer stocks and can then control prices by releasing grain through its distribution system.</p>
<p>Tanna said domestic demand for rice had been growing in the recent past due to a drop in state purchases of wheat.</p>
<p>Exporters said demand for lower grades of Indian rice picked up last week as buyers signed contracts in anticipation of further price rises at the end of the season.</p>
<p>But exports of higher grades of rice had been facing stiff competition from Vietnam, Pakistan and Burma, Tanna said.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the new crop comes some time in September/October Indian exports will become competitive,&quot; Tanna said. &quot;But everything depends on the rain gods.&quot;</p>
<p>The four-month June-September monsoon season set in after a week's delay, causing a mild concern among farmers as they prepared for sowing across the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsoon has covered most parts of the country, though it is still weak in some regions,&quot; said Navin Shah, president of the Bombay Oilseeds and Oils Exchange.</p>
<p>Shah said the arrival of rains and enough imports of palmolein had a sobering effect on domestic edible oil prices.</p>
<p>He said traders had booked up to 80,000 tonnes of palmolein for delivery in each of the months of June and July.</p>
<p>&quot;Shipments of imported palmolein are arriving at regular intervals,&quot; Shah said.</p>
<p>In the week to Friday, groundnut oil prices moved in a narrow range of 355/356 rupees per 10 kg. Palmolein fell three rupees to 266 per 10 kg.</p>
<p>In soybean, the focus has shifted from soymeal exports to preparations for sowing as pre-monsoon rains arrived in central India which accounts for the bulk of the country's production.</p>
<p>According to the Soybean Processors&quot; Association of India (SOPA), the area under soybean cultivation is expected to rise to 5.7 million hectares in the 1997/98 season (November/October) from 4.0 million in the current year.</p>
<p>SOPA has cautioned farmers to sow soybean only after their lands received a rainfall of 7.0-8.0 cm.</p>
<p>&quot;The soil should have enough moisture for good seed germination,&quot; a SOPA official said. Pre-monsoon rains had so far brought in a rainfall of about 4.0 cm.</p>
<p>SOPA has set a soybean production target of 5.7 million tonnes for 1997/98 against the current season's 4.0 million.</p>
<p>The monsoon made a good start in most cotton growing areas.</p>
<p>&quot;As of now, the cotton situation is very satisfactory,&quot; said C.H.Mirani, former president of the East India Cotton Association, a trade representative organisation.</p>
<p>Output in almost 70 percent of India's 9.0 million hectares of area under cotton is vulnerable to rainfall fluctuation.</p>
<p>Cotton prices remained steady in the week to Saturday, despite a shortage of ready stock. Traders said the bulk of the current season's record crop of 16.78 million bales (one bale is 170 kg) had already been marketed.</p>
<p>Gujarat Sankar-4 was quoted at 17,500/22,000 rupees per candy (355.56 kg) and Punjab F-414 was unchanged at 2,080/2,090 rupees per maund (37.32 kg). (Conversion $1.00=35.80)</p>
