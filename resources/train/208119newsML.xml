<headline>NZ dlr strength a concern of all parties - Peters.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-11-21</dateline>

<p>New Zealand First Party leader Winston Peters said on Thursday that the strength of the New Zealand dollar was as concerning to other parties as it was to NZ First.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a matter that's exercising the minds of all political parties here, us no less than others,&quot; he told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Peters reiterated comments that those responsible for the strength of the New Zealand dollar, which hit a new 8-1/2 year high today, were in the current caretaker government regime.</p>
<p>Peters said that NZ First, which holds the balance of power following the inconclusive October 12 election, campaigned on the basis of an export-led recovery.</p>
<p>He said he was still of the view that there would be an export-led recovery, but people would have to wait until a coalition was formed to find out how that would come about.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime I can't say anything positive or meaningful because we're in opposition effectively,&quot; Peters said.  </p>
