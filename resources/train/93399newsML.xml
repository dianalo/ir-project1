<p>Polish tyremaker Stomil Olsztyn SA, 52 percent owned by Michelin, expects to net 61 million zlotys on sales of 700 million zlotys this year, the company's financial director said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our latest forecast assumes sales of 700 million zlotys, which means that our net profit will reach 61 million zlotys,&quot; Bohdan Stankiewicz said at a meeting with investors and journalists.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company forecast its net profit at 65-70 million zlotys on sales of 720-730 million zlotys.  </p>
<p>Jan Debek, general manager and deputy president said the company expected to sell 2.2 million tyres this year, of which between 1.3 and 1.5 million would be sold domesticly.</p>
<p>Debek said these included 100,000 winter tyres sold under the company's &quot;Kormoran&quot; brand name.</p>
<p>The main focus for this year would be to boost the company's share of the passenger-car replacement market to 30 percent from the current 26 percent. Debek said the company also wanted to become a supplier of domestic car producers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in talks with automotive concerns which produce cars in Poland, but it is too early to disclose when new tyres will be put on new cars,&quot; Debek said.</p>
<p>Stomil, based in Olsztyn, expected to invest $30 million this year and another $100 million over the next two years.</p>
<p>Debek said the company would not issue new stock until 1999 and would finance investments from profits, loans and debt issues, such as commercial paper on the domestic market. The borrowed funds would be used primarily to build a national sales network.</p>
