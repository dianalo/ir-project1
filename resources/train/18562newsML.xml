<p>Dutch shares closed higher on Wednesday, helped by a firmer bond market and the feeling that the continuing stream of company results have been within or better than expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The undertone is still OK,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;The bond market was good today and companies releasing figures have not been that disappointing. There's not that much risk in the market at the moment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The AEX share index closed 2.97 points higher at 563.38, back from an early session high of 565.34, with much of today's volume driven by retail investors returning from holiday.</p>
<p>The market took its early tone from figures announced by publisher VNU late on Tuesday. The shares touched a session high of 31.10 guilders on early enthusiasm before dipping back to finish 90 cents higher at 30.00 guilders.</p>
<p>Nutricia added another 4.90 guilders to 228.60, continuing its spectacular charge higher since last Thursday's news of a 51 percent higher first half profit and its forecast of similar growth for the full year.</p>
<p>Some analysts see the way open for Nutricia to reach 250 guilders a share by year end. The shares have risen from around 191.00 since last week.</p>
