<p>Negative investor sentiment towards gold-mining companies could create buying opportunities, a fund manager said on Monday.</p>
<p>Suzanne Killea, a portfolio manager with Franklin Templeton which has $450 million invested in gold assets, said investor sentiment towards gold producers &quot;is less than robust now. The Busang saga has really put a pall on the entire sector&quot;.</p>
<p>She was referring to the Busang deposit in Indonesia, discovered by Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd.</p>
<p>The company at one time put gold reserves at 71 million ounces, which would have made it the biggest gold find this century.</p>
<p>But preliminary tests by Bre-X's partner Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold Inc indicated the property might contain &quot;insignificant&quot; amounts of gold. The announcement prompted heavy selling of Bre-X shares last month.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a re-rating occurring across the board, most principally affecting exploration and junior (mining companies),&quot; Killea said at Platt's Metals Week 1997 precious metals conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are going to continue to see a shift towards the established producers,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Killea said sentiment over the next few months would remain negative. &quot;It may take until the third quarter this year to see investors return to the sector...which actually creates buying opportunities. I think we are starting to see good value found across all the sectors,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;To some extent investors have thrown the baby out with the bath water and therefore either the investors with cash and patience and/or the majors with cash and patience will see some great buying opportunities,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the companies with positive cash flow and cash could potentially pick up some low-cost ounces in the juniors and exploratory (companies). You'll probably see a bit of M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) work coming out in the second half of this year and possibly into 1998,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The juniors that have cash in their coffers and are able to add value through reserve additions and potentially moving into production should also see good value for the investors,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Killea said her forecast was &quot;to position the fund for again the trading band that I had last year which was roughly $350 to $375 an ounce... basically a stable gold price.&quot;</p>
<p>Firoze Katrak, vice-president of business consulting at Charles River Associates Inc, told the conference he forecast a gold price range of between $300 and $375 an ounce until 1999. He forecast a higher gold price after 1999 but did not give a figure.</p>
