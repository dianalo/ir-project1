<p>Gunmen killed an activist of a Shi'ite Moslem militant group near the town of Multan in Pakistan's Punjab province, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said unidentified gunmen fired on Barkat Ali and his nephew Abid Askari as they rode a motorcycle in Chichawatni town 130 km (81 miles) east of Multan on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ali, a local leader of the Shi'ite Sipah-i-Mohammad Pakistan (SMP) group, died on the spot. Askari was taken to hospital in Multan in critical condition with six bullet wounds.</p>
<p>A doctor said one bullet had hit Askari in the head and he was on a life support system.</p>
<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but local followers of the SMP said they believed that the militant Sunni Moslem Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan group was behind the attack.</p>
<p>Sunni-Shi'ite disputes over Islamic beliefs have often spilled into violence in Pakistan. Wednesday's killing follows a series of sectarian attacks this year in the central province of Punjab and the southern province of Sindh.</p>
<p>Sunnis dominate Pakistan's population of about 130 million people, of which Shi'ites constitute about 15 percent.</p>
