<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his first deputy Anatoly Chubais on Monday at about 2 p.m. (1100 GMT), the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>A spokesman did not give a reason for their meeting. But it was clear they would put the finishing touches to the new line-up of the Russian government which Yeltsin is expected to unveil before he leaves for a March 20-21 summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Helsinki.  </p>
<p>&quot;No reason for the meeting has been formally announced but of course you understand what they will talk about,&quot; a spokesman at the presidential press service said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has promised a government reshuffle but the process appears to be dragging on longer than expected.</p>
<p>Russian media have said tough bargaining is going on between the liberal Chubais, who wants a number of his allies brought into the cabinet, and Chernomyrdin, who is also a reformer but is considered more conservative than his new deputy.</p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman said that before meeting Chernomyrdin and Chubais, Yeltsin was due to meet the liberal governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, Boris Nemtsov. The media have said Nemtsov is a potential candidate for a government post.</p>
