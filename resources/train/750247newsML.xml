<text>
<p>Supertyphoon Rosie, with 155 mph winds, is expected to pass east of Okinawa on its track to the north. Rosie is expected to head for southern Japan, and landfall should occur in 60 hours in southern Kyushu. Top winds at that time should be close to 125 mph. Rosie will likely result in significant damage where it makes landfall. There will be further statements as the storm approaches the region.  </p>
<p>Significant flooding has occurred over northeastern Europe the past several days. More rainfall over the weekend added to already severe flooding in eastern Germany and especially Poland. There is a good chance of additional rainfall during today, and this will aggrivate the flooding situation. Property damage has been extensive in some locations, and crop losses are being reported.  </p>
<p>More rains are causing additional flooding problems in Bangladesh. Recent flooding, combined with rainfall from a new storm system, will add to flooding and may result in more property and crop damage over the next few days.</p>
