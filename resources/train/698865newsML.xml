<p>SIMEX Japanese government bond (JGB) and Euroyen futures were firmer in late trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said morning rumours that Japan's ministry of finance (MOF) would buy outright bonds worth about 100 billion yen fuelled a rally in JGBs.</p>
<p>September JGBs surged to a high of 124.65 before easing to end at 124.49 against their previous close at 124.12 after the rumours were proven unfounded.</p>
<p>The MOF later said it would reduce its bimonthly issue volumes of both six- and four- year JGBs to 400 billion yen each from 500 billion yen.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the upside on JGBs was reined in Japan's uninspiring June auto sales data, which showed a five percent year-on-year decline instead of a double-digit drop.</p>
<p>Euroyen futures got a boost from a surprisingly generous money market operation by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It was unexpected and helped reinforce market belief of a stable rate policy in Japan,&quot; a dealer with a European institution said.</p>
<p>BOJ left about 390 billion yen surplus in the market after injecting 200 billion yen on Tuesday morning, dealers said.  </p>
<p>March Euroyen was trading around 98.94 against its IMM close of 98.88. December was at 99.14 against its previous IMM close at 99.11.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starting on Tuesday kept Eurodollar activity muted despite expectations that the two-day meeting would leave rates unchanged.</p>
<p>March Eurodollars ended at 93.795 against its previous IMM close at 93.805. Volume was at 6991 lots.</p>
