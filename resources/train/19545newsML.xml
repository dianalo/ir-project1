<headline>U.S. says brokered new Kurdish truce in Iraq.</headline>

<p>The United States confirmed on Wednesday it had brokered a new ceasefire between warring Kurdish militias in northern Iraq, the second in less than a week, and said it hoped it would clear the way for peace talks.</p>
<p>The ceasefire took effect at midnight Washington time (0400 GMT Wednesday) and appeared to be holding, the State Department said.</p>
<p>It said the United States was trying to bring about peace talks between guerrillas of the rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and forces of the Patriotic Union  of Kurdistan (PUK).</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking to cement the cease-fire that we have in place, which builds on the cease-fire agreement that we had before, because every cease-fire builds on the other,&quot; State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said.</p>
<p>The United States is nudging the factions to take part in proposed talks in London next month under the auspices of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau, who brokered the latest truce by telephone from Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to try to make this one stick and try to get the parties to London to meet under the auspices of Assistant Secretary Pelletreau to talk about a broader reconciliation,&quot; Davies told reporters.</p>
<p>In Ankara, the PUK said earlier it had agreed to the new U.S.-brokered cease-fire with the KDP.</p>
