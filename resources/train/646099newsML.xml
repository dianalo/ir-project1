<title>USA: Recovery Engineering raises rev outlook.</title>

<p>Recovery Engineering Inc said Monday it raised its estimate for revenues in the second quarter to about $14 million, which would mark the largest quarter in its history.</p>
<p>But the designer and maker of drinking water systems said it has not revised its forecast for revenue for the full year.</p>
<p>In April, the company forecast second-quarter revenue of $10 million to $11 million, said chief financial officer Chuck Karpinske.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased with the increased interest in our products by our retailers and consumers,&quot; said Brian Sullivan, president and chief executive of Recovery Engineering. &quot;We are also optimistic about our revenue estimates for the remainder of the year. However, we feel it is still too early to revise our previous annual revenue estimates.&quot;</p>
<p>The forecast for second-quarter revenue would represent an increase of 112 percent from the second quarter of last year, the company said.</p>
<p>The increase in revenue was driven by added distribution and increased retail sell through of Recovery's water filters for the household market, it said. The revision was based on actual orders received and orders expected to be received before the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>The timing of the expected orders, combined with short lead times, may affect this revenue estimate, the company said.</p>
