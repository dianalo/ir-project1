<p>Most global investors are cautiously optimistic about South African equities and the economy after two years of negative sentiment although growth will remain low relative to other emerging markets, a survey released on Thursday showed.</p>
<p>The report said the rand is thought to have depreciated enough to make valuations attractive, interest rates are seen coming down and long-term there will be a loosening of exchange controls linked to inflows from privatisation.</p>
<p>The survey was commissioned by consultants Burson-Marsteller and covered 15 major UK and U.S. investors in South African equities, with combined assets in emerging market equities of over $27 billion. It was carried out in March.</p>
<p>It also said President Nelson Mandela's succession had been factored into valuations, while his likely successor Thabo Mbeki was seen as a &quot;safe pair of hands&quot; for the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;...the ANC is seen as possessing a dynamic leadership capable of taking the country into the next century. This is particularly encouraging given that most emerging economies have a question mark over their long-term political stability.&quot;</p>
<p>The survey said exchange controls were seen slowing market development, while the high degree of cross-shareholdings between South African public companies makes it difficult for foreign investors to get a pure play on a chosen sector.</p>
<p>&quot;However, recent moves towards unbundling by larger South African stocks are widely applauded by the international investment community,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The survey found optimism about the service, leisure and IT sectors among investors who had examined small and mid-cap companies.</p>
<p>It said the country's high crime rate was not seen directly impacting on portfolio investment, but was seen hampering direct investment and sectors dependent on tourism.</p>
<p>On privatisation, fund managers felt the process would be slower than in other emerging markets as it needed to be achieved through consensus, and were positive about the participation of trade unions in the process.</p>
<p>The survey said negative sentiment was mainly due to South Africa's low growth rates relative to other emerging markets, which is perceived to be a long term problem.</p>
