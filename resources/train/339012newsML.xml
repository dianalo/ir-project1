<p>Elektrowatt AG said provisional results from the first quarter of its 1996/97 business years confirmed its optimistic expectations for the year.</p>
<p>An Elektrowatt statement said sales by its building controls segment rose 17 percent in the period from October through December. Its business year started on October 31, 1996.</p>
<p>In the power business, sales at industrial activities were at much the same level as the year before while the electricity companies benefited from an exceptionally cold winter.  </p>
<p>Elektrowatt plans to split into two groups this year and be bought by separate groups. Industrial side Elektrowatt is due to be taken by Germany's Siemens and power side Watt AG will go to a German-Swiss utility consortium.</p>
<p>In its annual report for 1995/96, Elektrowatt had forecast higher global growth in orders received and sales at its main building control business Landis &amp; Staefa.</p>
<p>Cerberus, the security systems side of its building segment, expected internal growth of five percent and an &quot;above-average&quot; rise in profits in 1996/97, the report said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Landis &amp; Staefa recorded a 17 percent increase in orders received, while Cerberus achieved a 20 percent rise,&quot; Elektrowatt said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales revenues at Landis &amp; Staefa and Cerberus were 12 percent and 26 percent higher than last year, respectively,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>In the Americas and Asia-Pacific, Landis &amp; Staefa sales and new orders were both up over 20 percent, according to the statement released before an annual news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;In Europe, both figures were well up compared with the previous year,&quot; it added.</p>
