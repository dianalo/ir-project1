<title>UK: Euro barges recover to $82 fob, other grades quiet.</title>
<headline>Euro barges recover to $82 fob, other grades quiet.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>European high sulphur barge prices picked up on Thursday from previous day lows but trade was still thin, traders said.</p>
<p>Deals were done mainly at $82 fob ARA, with a little at $82.50 and bunker demand was reported as moderate.</p>
<p>&quot;The bunkers were rather healthy for this week but were moderate in absolute terms,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The sharp price swings over the last two days have unsettled some in the market, with low volumes making values particularly prone to volatility. Barges were traded as high as $87 on Tuesday and hit a low of $79.50 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were little discussed although bids of $77 and $78 cif were reported heard in the market. Buyers were complaining the market was being artificially propped up.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are now more used to price other deals than to set a value for real activity,&quot; said one player.</p>
<p>Portugal's state electricity company announced results of its high sulphur cracked tender, with state refiner Petrogal heard to have won one 25,000 tonne cargo and a U.S. refiner/trader another.</p>
<p>The market believed the prices were around mean of mean NWE fob and mean Med fob plus $7.50 or $8.00.  </p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked markets were again very quiet. - London newsroom +44 171 542 8060</p>
