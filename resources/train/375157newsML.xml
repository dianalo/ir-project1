<p>The Russian Central Bank is in full control of the foreign exchange market, and its position is stronger now the International Monetary Fund has agreed to disburse delayed tranches of its $10 billion loan, bankers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Central Bank First Deputy Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko said on Wednesday the bank had enough reserves to support the rouble in the corridor it had established at the end of last year.</p>
<p>He was commenting after concern began to spread that the Central Bank was running out of funds to easily prevent the rouble from falling too quickly instead of depreciating at a slow planned rate in line with the rouble corridor policy.</p>
<p>Alfa-Bank hard currency department head Alexander Osmolovsky said the central bank had plenty of reserves now the IMF had approved disbursement of about $650 million in overdue tranches.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central Bank has never felt better,&quot; he said. &quot;It can put out any speculative movement. No one will go against it.&quot;</p>
<p>The authorities have been operating a crawling peg regime for over a year, allowing the rouble to depreciate gently in line with inflation, by holding it within upper and lower limits known as a corridor.</p>
<p>Under this policy the rouble, trading on Thursday at about 5,652 per dollar, should be in a 5,750-6,350 per dollar range at the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The rouble has never strayed from inside the corridor or the bid/offer set within the corridor by the Central Bank since last summer.</p>
<p>Last autumn a quicker-than expected fall in the rouble rate made it more attractive to invest in the dollar, pushing up yields on Treasury bills when the government was trying to bring down interest rates.</p>
<p>Yields are now around 30 percent compared with over 200 percent early last year.</p>
<p>Aleksashenko said the Central Bank had bought about $1.5 billion in December, by converting proceeds from Russia's first Eurobond and non-resident funds for investment in T-bills.</p>
<p>But it sold about $1 billion in January, although in the first days of February it only bought dollars, he said.</p>
<p>He also said the Bank's hard currency reserves were over $10 billion.</p>
<p>An analyst, who asked not to be named, said the rouble rate was the last problem the Central Bank would think about.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central Bank has more than enough funds to support the rouble,&quot; he said. &quot;Our trade and payment balances testify to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia posted a preliminary trade surplus of $28.8 billion in 1996 after $21.6 billion in 1995, according to the State Statistics Committee.</p>
