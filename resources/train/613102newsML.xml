<headline>India's CII urges higher petroleum product prices.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-05-24</dateline>

<p>A leading Indian industry body on Saturday urged the government to raise the prices of some petroleum products and eventually phase out oil subsidy programmes.</p>
<p>The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) issued the appeal on the eve of a meeting of Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's United Front coalition to consider a mounting oil subsidy bill.</p>
<p>The 15-party centre-left alliance was expected at Sunday's meeting to recommend raising the prices of some oil products to plug the ballooning subsidy bill.</p>
<p>The CII said the prices of high-speed diesel, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene should be increased immediately by 15 percent.</p>
<p>It also called for the phasing out of subsidies on those three petroleum products within two to three years.</p>
<p>The CII said in a statement that &quot;the government should brook no delay and must be bold and pragmatic in correcting distortions in the prices of petroleum products&quot;.</p>
<p>The trade association said the time was ripe as inflation is moderate and the macroeconomic fundamentals are sound.</p>
<p>Newspapers this week said the government had tentatively decided to raise the prices of diesel and kerosene with a plan that would trim about $1.5 billion from the subsidy bill but spare petrol users.</p>
<p>Under the plan, kerosene prices would be increased by 20 percent, while those of high speed diesel and LPG would be raised by 15 percent. The price of petrol, which is not subsidised, would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>News reports said Gujral, who is also petroleum minister, had endorsed the plan which would be presented on Sunday.</p>
<p>But left-wing parties in the United Front were opposed to raising prices, and instead favoured increasing production, cutting import duties on crude oil and petroleum products and discouraging the use of luxury cars.</p>
