<p>Controversial Australian politician Pauline Hanson, who sparked a divisive race row, faced mounting criticism over her outspoken views on Sunday, with Canberra warning she jeopardised Australian prosperity.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer said the independent politician from Queensland state was endangering Australia's standard of living and future wealth by jeopardising billions of dollars in trade with the regional economic powers.</p>
<p>&quot;Pauline Hanson's agenda now should be scrutinised in more detail when she eventually produces her party platform, because the essence of where she ends up is to tear up our bread ticket for the next century,&quot; Fischer said in a television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;To undercut exports to Asia from Australia and the standard of living that flows from Australia exporting a huge diversity of product to Asia -- A$46 billion (US$36 billion) of exports to Asia -- which she would put in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
<p>A Chinese community group in Hanson's home state said at the weekend it would lodge an official objection against her planned One Nation Party, describing the party as racially divisive.</p>
<p>But an opinion poll published last week showed One Nation had already achieved a similar level of support as the Australian Democrats, regarded as the third force in Australian politics, after the conservative Liberal-National coalition and the left-leaning Labor Party.</p>
<p>Hanson sparked a bitter race row last year when she said Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians and that native Aborigines received favoured treatment at the expense of white Australians.</p>
<p>The controversy flared again last week over a book titled &quot;Pauline Hanson, The Truth&quot;, which contained unsubstantiated claims that Aborigines were once cannibals who ate their children. Hanson did not write the book but supported its contents and owned the copyright, her adviser said.</p>
