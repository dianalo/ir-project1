<headline>Kabila magic dims as city waits to see leader.</headline>
<dateline>LUBUMBASHI, Zaire 1997-04-17</dateline>

<p>A week after rebel forces entered Lubumbashi, the people of Zaire's second city were still waiting on Thursday to hear from rebel leader Laurent Kabila.</p>
<p>The rebels have taken care of business here very efficiently, signing a billion-dollar deal on Wednesday to revive the mining industry.</p>
<p>But the masses were feeling ignored.</p>
<p>The thrill of revolution which last week seized the once elegant city, formerly known as Elisabethville, has been diluted by uncertainty, which locals say will not be dispelled until the leader appears in public.</p>
<p>Kabila flew back to Lubumbashi on Thursday from an overnight trip to Cape Town aboard a South African airforce Learjet, after a new round of peace talks with President Nelson Mandela and the United Nations envoy Mohammed Sahnoun.</p>
<p>There was no word of any dramatic breakthrough to end the civil war, such as the departure of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila's bottom-line demand is that the man who has ruled Zaire for 32 years -- and ruined it -- must go.</p>
<p>Kabila's security men arrived late at Lubumbashi airport, where the stench of a corpse still rotting in the long grass recalled last week's fighting. They ejected waiting reporters brusquely before their man would get off the plane.</p>
<p>Unlike Monday, the day of Kabila's triumphant return to his native province, crowds lining the city's main streets simply stared after his convoy of vehicles, without waving or cheering.</p>
<p>A few thousand had already gathered expectantly in the Place de la Poste where an outdoor stage had been erected for Kabila's victory rally, expected at any moment.</p>
<p>But the cavalcade of official cars and truckloads of soldiers -- after taking a wrong turn, to the amusement of some bystanders -- swept by without slowing and took Kabila to his walled temporary residence here.</p>
<p>Some voiced impatience with what they took for arrogance. Others muttered that Kabila's people were worried about his security in Shaba province, where the rebels have met with something short of unalloyed joy.</p>
<p>The happiest people in Lubumbashi on Wednesday were European and American businessmen who signed a one billion dollar contract with Kabila's &quot;de facto government&quot; to exploit Shaba's fabulously rich copper, cobalt and zinc deposits.</p>
<p>&quot;You can put the champagne on ice, cherie. It's in the bag,&quot; one shouted into a cellular phone. And then they left.</p>
<p>Many of Kabila's soldiers are foreigners here, either from distant parts of sprawling Zaire, or from other African countries widely believed to be covertly helping the revolution that aims to topple Mobutu.</p>
<p>Advance men for Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) arrived on Sunday and promptly upset the influential regional UFERI party by firing governor Kyungu wa Kumwanza and announcing the appointment of an interim governor who has lived in Belgium since the 1970s.</p>
<p>The people of Shaba, formerly known as Katanga, are jealous of their autonomy and some were angered by the move.</p>
