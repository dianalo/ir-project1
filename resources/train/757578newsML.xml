<title>USA: Chevron seeks judge's recusal in Texas case.</title>
<headline>Chevron seeks judge's recusal in Texas case.</headline>

<p>Chevron Corp.'s attorneys have asked a federal judge who made controversial racial comments to recuse himself from a trial over pollution that allegedly sickened residents of a predominantly black Houston neighbourhood, a Chevron spokesman said.</p>
<p>Chevron attorneys, in a sealed motion, cited a July 16 hearing in which Judge Kenneth Hoyt, who is black, dismissed evidence from an Arthritis Foundation study concluding that African-Americans are more susceptible to lupus than the general population &quot;because white people wrote it.&quot;</p>
<p>According to a transcript of the hearing, Hoyt also said race was not a factor in determining whether residents of suburban Houston's Kennedy Heights neighbourhood were sickened by pollutants left behind in oil pits abandoned in the 1920s.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not because they are black, but because they live in a certain area that white people put them in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Attorneys in the case declined to comment, citing an earlier gag order issued by the judge. The case is being heard in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.</p>
<p>Hoyt is presiding over an ongoing trial on whether sludge left in the oil pits seeped into city water pipes, causing lupus, cancers and other diseases among residents of the neighbourhood later built on the site.</p>
<p>The property was operated from 1921 to 1927 by Gulf Oil -- which was later acquired by Chevron -- and was sold to a developer planning to build a &quot;Negro&quot; neighbourhood on the site, according to testimony in the case.</p>
<p>Attorney John O'Quinn, who represents the Kennedy Heights residents, charged the company with &quot;environmental racism&quot; in the case, which is being played out against a backdrop of simmering tensions between blacks and the oil industry.</p>
<p>Five national oil companies have been sued in recent years for racial discrimination by employees, and Rev. Jesse Jackson in May said he would seek a nationwide boycott of Chevron.</p>
<p>In its motion, Chevron said Hoyt's personal views on race have prevented the company from getting a fair trial. At one point in the proceedings, Hoyt said he believed physical differences among races were a product of their environment.</p>
<p>According to a transcript of the hearing, Hot said:</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you think Chinese people are so short? Because there is so much damn wind over there they need to be short. Why are they so tall in Africa? Because they need to be tall. It's environmental.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, you don't jump up and get a banana off a tree if you're only four feet. If you're seven feet tall and you're standing in China, then you're going to get blown away by that Siberian wind, aren't you?&quot;</p>
