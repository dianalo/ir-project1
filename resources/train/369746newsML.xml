<headline>U.S. spot gas prices soften on moderating weather.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot natgas prices erased Monday's minor gains on Tuesday as temperatures moderated across most of the U.S. and storage supplies were ample, sources said.</p>
<p>Swing Gulf Coast pipes eased about five to six cents to the high-$2.20s to mid-$2.30s, down about 60 cents from index levels.</p>
<p>Similarly in south Texas prices slipped into the mid-to-high $2.20s, down more than five cents from Monday. Temperatures in the state are forecast to remain slightly below normal throughout this week.  </p>
<p>In west Texas, Permian prices fell about three cents to the mid-$2.20s as most buyers relied on storage instead of entering the spot market.</p>
<p>Swing prices at the southern California border were quoted about 10 cents lower in the $2.32-2.41 range.</p>
<p>In the Midcontinent, prices were mostly steady in the low-$2.30s as most of the region anticipated the coldest day of the week on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chicago city-gate values were talked in the mid-to-high $2.40s.</p>
<p>In the East, New York city-gate gas prices dropped about 10 cents to the $2.75-2.90 range. Despite a brief spell of cold, snowy weather expected this week, temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic states are forecast to return to normal by Friday.</p>
