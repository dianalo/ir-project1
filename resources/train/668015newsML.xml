<p>Following is a list of analysts' reactions to British public sector borrowing requirement figures which showed a deficit of 3.96 billion stg in May. Economists had forecast a three billion deficit.</p>
<p>ROB HAYWARD, BANKAMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;Privatisation receipts are a little less than people hoped for. But overall, the numbers bounce around quite a lot from month to month. It's a slightly disappointing figure but the overall trend still seems to be improving. The room for manoeuvre has been restricted by Mr Brown himself. This figure won't change that position very much.&quot;  </p>
<p>DAVID COLEMAN, CIBC WOOD GUNDY</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to be definite about the trend (for the PSBR). I think Brown will be constrained in his budget. He will certainly be very wary about breaking the spirit of his election, no tax-increase pledges. But he will want to tighten policy a little bit, perhaps three billion stg of tightening. The issue is to what extent the budget will take the pressure off interest rates. That is how the market will judge Mr Brown's first budget.&quot;  </p>
<p>KIT JUCKES, NATWEST MARKETS</p>
<p>&quot;This is mostly a correction from last month's better-than-expected figure which benefited from early payment of VAT. But no doubt this figure is going to be viewed as a justification of a change or abolition of advance corporation tax in the (July 2) budget that has been talked about. That's how it will be dressed up.&quot;  </p>
<p>DAVID PHILPOTTS, UNION PLC</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are slightly disappointing. But we have had an extraordinarily good run in recent months, so this maybe just one bad apple. The general trend is very strong. Good receipt growth coupled with reasonable restraint on the spending side. But even if the trend of the first two of months of the year continues throughout the rest of the year, there's still a reasonable chance of a downward revision in the full-year PSBR figure.&quot;  </p>
<p>ANDREW SNOWBALL, CO-OPERATIVE BANK</p>
<p>&quot;The trend over two months or longer shows a picture of stronger economic growth which is boosting tax receipts. The trend growth rate in income tax and VAT is quite positive. Undoubtedly there is some disappointment on the May figures but this is partly offset by last month where the figures were much better than expected. In terms of the budget, these figures will not have much effect as most of the decisions will now have been taken but there is a case for a tighter policy.&quot;</p>
