<p>Former Cameroon goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell will finally be paid for taking part in the World Cup finals in Italy -- seven years after the event.</p>
<p>Bell sought the help of FIFA in his battle for payment of 37,000 French francs ($6,430) and a spokesman for the game's governing body said on Tuesday the Cameroon Football Federation had finally agreed to pay.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Bell) asked FIFA for support and based on the documents we received he was entitled to it,&quot; FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said. &quot;The Cameroonian federation said they would comply and pay him.&quot;</p>
<p>Bell is the only member of the 1990 squad to have persisted with trying to get his money.</p>
<p>The former France-based goalkeeper, who played for Marseille and St Etienne, was a controversial figure at the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990 where Cameroon reached the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Bell sat on the bench throughout the tournament after being dropped on the eve of the opening game against Argentina in Milan because of a dispute with team officials over payment.</p>
<p>He was also dropped after two games at the last World Cup finals in the U.S. after leading a threatened strike by the Cameroonian team.</p>
<p>&quot;If a player is entitled to money then he should get it,&quot; said Herren. &quot;For FIFA it was important the principle was upheld not the amount.&quot;</p>
<p>Bell, who retired at the age of 40 two years ago, recently lost his bid to win election for president of the Cameroonian Football Federation.</p>
<p>Reports from the Cameroon say other members of the 1990 squad are now also expected to claim back pay from the federation.</p>
