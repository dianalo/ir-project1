<p>Despite official denials that Sweden's position has not changed, Swedish newspapers and some economists said on Monday the country was looking increasingly isolated in its decision to stay outside the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).</p>
<p>Finance Minister Erik Asbrink, asked whether Italy's re-entry would increase pressure on Sweden to join, told reporters in Brussels: &quot;I don't think it will to any greater extent.&quot;</p>
<p>Central Bank Governor Urban Backstrom added that the meeting of European Union finance ministers and central bank governors had not discussed the crown, and reiterated that Sweden's position was unchanged.</p>
<p>However Swedish newspapers were almost unanimous that the pressure was now on Sweden to make up its mind to go in.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculation could grow that Sweden might soon follow the Italians, which would have the effect of sinking rates and strengthening the crown,&quot; Dagens Nyheter said.</p>
<p>Sweden, Greece and Britain are now the only European Union (EU) countries outside the currency grid, and this increases the political pressure on Sweden to go in, the paper added.</p>
<p>&quot;Pressure is going to mount on both the government and Riksbank, the central bank, to link the crown to ERM after the Italian re-entry,&quot; the financial daily Dagens Industri said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sweden and Greece are now the only countries outside the grid and lacking an opt-out clause on EMU. Britain and Denmark have negotiated such an opt-out for themselves,&quot; the paper noted.</p>
<p>Sweden has repeatedly said the issue is not on the agenda now, even if it has not ruled out entry sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Asbrink said in a statement on Sunday night: &quot;It is still the government's perception that it is not a current issue for Sweden to link the crown to the ERM.</p>
<p>&quot;Since November 1992 Sweden has a floating exchange rate. Price stability is the overriding aim for monetary and exchange rate policy. This approach has been successful and there is no reason to change it.&quot;</p>
<p>The government and parliament will in the autumn of 1997 decide on Swedish participation, Asbrink added.</p>
<p>Backstrom said Sweden's credibility as a country with low inflation is being established. Sweden therefore has a good possibility of fulfilling the conditions for membership of EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;Participation in the ERM requires a period of stability in the Swedish economy. Broad support in society for the crown's adherence to the ERM is also necessary. Membership of the ERM is not on the agenda for now,&quot; the Riksbank governor said</p>
<p>Handelsbanken economist Jan Haggstrom did not see any immediate impact on Swedish rates from the Italian ERM re-entry.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not connected with the Italian decision. The pressure on Sweden to go in increases a bit but it has already been considerable,&quot; Haggstrom said.</p>
<p>Swedish interest rates dipped slightly at the opening on Monday and the crown strengthened a fraction, but dealers said this was only the initial reaction and might not be maintained through the day.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken's chief economist Carl B Hamilton said he thought the market would test the Italian lira, probably during 1997. &quot;There will probably be a speculative attack against the lira and they will test which band rate Italy is prepared to defend,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Italy's re-entry leads again to disadvantageous comparisons between Italy, Finland and others on one side, and the &quot;reluctant Europeans&quot; on the other, including Britain and Sweden, Hamilton said in a statement.</p>
