<p>NWE spot gas oil markets shed morning gains as benchmark IPE gas oil futures were dragged lower by sharply weaker crude, traders said.</p>
<p>However, barge brokers said outright trade was thin with a strong dollar versus the mark keeping demand from the key German market quiet though inland refiners reported good business.</p>
<p>&quot;The Germans are buying cheaper oil inland&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Balance of July heating oil barges for Rotterdam refinery lifting were traded around $1.75 a tonne over the August gas oil contract with storage material around 50 cents cheaper though some trade house dealers said premiums were slightly weaker than this in the afternoon with supply tightness easing.</p>
<p>Diesel barges were offered at August +$5 in Rotterdam with Flushing and Antwerp loadings 50 cents cheaper. Buyers for both were scarce but brokers said sellers were reluctant to offer the market down for fear of being taken out by heating oil.</p>
<p>A backlog of barges waiting to load at the jointly owned BP, Texaco Nerefco refinery in Rotterdam was also seen causing short-term supply problems, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that everybody wants to load on the 16th and in order to avoid demurrage costs the refiners have put some nominations for the 16th back to the 18th,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Cargoes premiums were also slightly firmer on the day as a knock-on effect of the tighter Rotterdam market.</p>
<p>O.2 sulphur cargoes talked around August IPE +$1.50-$2 a tonne cif NWE after trade at +$1.75 on Friday.</p>
<p>Diesel talked around August IPE +$4/+$5 after trading at $4.75 cif NWE for delivery by July 20th on Friday.</p>
