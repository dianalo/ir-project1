<p>Equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic reacted strongly on Thursday after U.S. figures showed a rise in weekly jobless claims and a narrower-than-expected international trade gap.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones index zoomed up in the first few minutes of trade before slipping back, while European bourses spiked upward in anticipation of a strong day on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The dollar also leapt, climbing through 114 yen and 1.7360 marks but was not able to hang on to its highs.</p>
<p>The London and Paris stock markets also turned mixed again by mid-afternoon, bedevilled by local worries.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce said the American trade deficit rose 7.8 percent to $8.4 billion in April as record exports were not enough to offset record imports.</p>
<p>That was lower than expected, however, and combined with the rise in jobless claims provided a boost to markets that had been trading quietly ahead of the data.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports are showing considerable strength, which is particularly good news in the face of a strong dollar,&quot; Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Barnett Bank Inc in the United States said.</p>
<p>&quot;It indicates the improvement in various countries throughout the world and that U.S productivity is allowing good export performance.&quot;</p>
<p>The trade data came a day after Japan reported a 222 percent rise in its overall trade surplus and the day before the Group of Seven (G7) begins a three-day meeting in which trade could become a source of friction.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said overnight the G7 would probably discuss the risk that further significant increases in Japan's trade surplus could undermine growth in other countries and trigger a backlash against trade liberalisation.</p>
<p>Most dealers do not expect the G7 to change its stance on foreign exchange rates from April's statement that opposed wild currency swings but did not make any explicit references to specific levels or intervention.</p>
<p>The dollar has depreciated almost 12 percent from a 4-1/2 year high of 127.47 yen reached just after the last G7 meeting in Washington in April.</p>
<p>German shares proved the strongest among Europe's major equity markets, with dealers saying the market was largely driven by technical factors ahead of Friday's &quot;triple witching&quot; of futures and options contract.</p>
<p>The Ifo economic institute reported that German business confidence was slightly higher than expected in May and said it believed Europe's powerhouse economy could still qualify for monetary union.</p>
<p>It forecast German gross domestic product would grow between 2.0 and 2.5 percent in 1997, but the average number of unemployed would rise by more than 300,000 to 4.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers support the view that the economic recovery is on track and that the economy is poised for expansion,&quot; said Armin Kayser, economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index closed up 19 points, or 0.51 percent, at 3,749.27 and the IBIS DAX index was up nearly one percent in later screen-based business.</p>
<p>French stocks spent a volatile day but slipped to their day's lows as new Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's made his keynote policy speech to parliament.</p>
<p>Privatisation candidate Thomson-CSF was the biggest loser in the CAC-40 after Jospin said government did not favour selling the state electronic and aerospace firm.</p>
<p>Thomson shares were off their lows but down 2.8 percent down at 1430 GMT in reaction to Jospin's statement.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 14.31 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,737.43.</p>
<p>Like Frankfurt, the London share market was heavily influenced by derivatives ahead of Friday's futures and options expiry.</p>
<p>Also weighing on the market were worries about next month's budget and news of an 11.1 percent year-on-year rise in M4 money supply in May, which reinforced fears of another rise in interest rates following Wednesday's strong retail sales figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures today are going to be damaging to the gilt markets with such strong lending on the back of strong retail sales numbers. It is certainly going to put upward pressure on inflation expectations,&quot; Nikko economist Simon Briscoe said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now quite likely that base rates will rise in July unless the budget is especially tough on the personal sector.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue chip FTSE 100 index briefly managed to push over Wednesday's closing levels but turned negative again as Wall Street pared its early gains. By 1430 GMT it was down 7.6 points at 4,649.4.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.7263 marks and 114.16 yen, compared with 1.7289 and 113.32 in late European trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 7.6 points, or 0.16 percent, at 4,649.4.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was up 14.31 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,737.43.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index ended up 19 points, or 0.51 percent, at 3,749.27.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $340.20 just five cents above its morning level. Silver was up five cents at $4.78. Platinum regaining losses to trade at $417.50, while palladium rose $8.50 to $202.50.</p>
