<p>South Korea's battered Kia Group on Friday won a promise of help from major non-bank creditors, but jitters continued after Pohang Iron and Steel Co (POSCO) threatened to halt steel supplies to Kia's car-making unit.</p>
<p>The central Bank of Korea poured emergency funds into the banking system to avert a liquidity squeeze at banks, which have been staggered by a string of corporate collapses.</p>
<p>It also repeatedly stepped into the interbank market to slow the local currency's slide against the dollar.</p>
<p>Kia Group, the country's eighth largest conglomerate, welcomed news of the merchant banks' decision to help.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome any help from anybody when we ourselves are making efforts under various self-rescue plans,&quot; said Jeun Sang-jin, a Kia Group spokesman.</p>
<p>The group's financial crisis, which deepened when creditor banks pledged on Tuesday to protect Kia from imminent failure, has rocked the local financial industry.</p>
<p>Kia Motors Corp and 17 other units of the group have been designated by creditor banks for bail-out.</p>
<p>On Friday eight merchant banking firms, which are among Kia's major non-bank creditors, said they would provide Kia with whatever short-term assistance they could muster.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed to actively cooperate for the normalisation of management at the Kia Group in the near future,&quot; the eight firms said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>These firms included Daehan Investment Banking Corp, Shinhan Investment Bank, First Merchant Bank and Tongyang Merchant Bank.</p>
<p>Merchant banks have been widely criticised for worsening the financial troubles of companies struggling under heavy debts by hastily calling in commercial notes.</p>
<p>The Kia Group had 9.54 trillion won ($10.7 billion) of debts from financial institutions as of the end of May, of which 4.36 trillion won worth was from merchant banks and insurance firms, according to the Korea Federation of Banks.</p>
<p>Kia's Jeun said the group was optimistic that the problem with POSCO would be settled before it created trouble at Kia Motors.</p>
<p>A Kia statement said POSCO, the nation's largest steelmaker, had given notice it would suspend some steel supplies to Kia Motors without cash payment because of unpaid promissory notes.</p>
<p>&quot;We have enough stocks to cover our production to the end of this month and hope this matter will be settled soon,&quot; Jeun said, without elaborating on how Kia would settle the matter.</p>
<p>Kia Motors won additional support from its usually hard-line union, which said it would collect and donate some 100 billion won to the management. No other details on the donations were announced.</p>
<p>The union earlier said it would let management set this year's wage increase rate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea on Friday poured about 989 billion won in emergency funds into the banking system through repurchase agreement operations.</p>
<p>It also repeatedly intervened in the interbank market, offering to sell dollars in forward trading, in an effort to slow the local currency's drop.</p>
<p>Even before Kia's crisis, the won had been pressured by fears about possible impacts from the recent effective devaluations of the Thai and Philippine currencies.</p>
<p>Despite the intervention, the won weakened further, closing Friday's spot trading at 894.90 to the dollar, down from the previous close of 893.50 on Wednesday. The interbank market was closed on Thursday for a public holiday.</p>
<p>(Conversion: $1 = 892.80 won)</p>
