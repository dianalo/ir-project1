<p>Stocks ended mixed on Tuesday as investors took profits after last week's record-setting rally and bonds weakened despite fresh news of subdued inflation.</p>
<p>The dollar drifted lower. Oil prices rose and gold fell.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.31 points to 7,760.78 after rebounding from a selloff of nearly 70 points. In the broader market, losers narrowly beat gainers 1,239 to 1,231 on heavy volume of 542 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>But the Nasdaq Composite index hit a new record high for the third session in a row, rising 11.16 points to 1,443.11, thanks to gains in technology stocks.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.53 of a point to 894.43, a new high.</p>
<p>The market was in a profit-taking mode despite new data that confirmed inflation was still dormant.</p>
<p>The government reported the Consumer Price Index for May inched up 0.1 percent last month. Excluding the often-volatile food and energy components, the core CPI rose 0.2 percent, in line with Wall Street's forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is basically selling on the news,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. &quot;There is nothing to suggest it's inflationary and it's not a cause for concern.&quot;</p>
<p>The data showed that inflation remained in check, further strengthening Wall Street's belief that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates when it meets in early July. But the market still headed lower.</p>
<p>The benign data on retail prices came on the heels of a tame Producer Price Index last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The CPI was the last nail in the coffin for the Fed -- the most important data between now and their July meeting. It looks like clear sailing ahead. The Dow could test 8,000 in the next few weeks,&quot; said Baker.</p>
<p>In another report, housing starts for May fell 4.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.397 million, compared with a revised rate of 1.468 million in April.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury fell 11/32, or $6.875 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 6.72 percent from 6.69 percent at Monday's close. The price and the yield move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.7305 German marks and 113.32 Japanese yen from 1.7315 marks and 113.43 yen.</p>
<p>Coffee prices jumped as monthly stock figures reawakened concern about tight supplies and halted a three-week slump.</p>
<p>At New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, coffee for July delivery closed 12.20 cents per pound higher at $2.0870, still more than $1.00 below the 20-year high of $3.18 per pound set in late May.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, fear about tight supplies of soybeans sparked a sharp rise in prices. CBOT soybeans for July delivery closed 14-1/2 cents a bushel higher at $8.53.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude ended higher ahead of weekly oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) which traders expected would report a healthy drawdown in crude inventories.</p>
<p>Crude oil for July delivery closed 22 cents a barrel higher at $19.23. July gasoline ended up 0.45 cent at 58.48 cents a gallon and July heating oil finished up 0.51 cent at 52.45 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 closed at 4,682.2, down 62.9 points, or 1.33 percent. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,593.66, down 87.41 points, or 0.42 percent.</p>
