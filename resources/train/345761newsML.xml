<p>The German parliament approved on Thursday a declaration of reconciliation with the Czech Republic intended to set aside lingering resentments more than five decades after the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority in the lower house gave their blessing to the agreement, which was signed last week by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.</p>
<p>In the declaration, Bonn expresses sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands, and Prague its regret for the post-war expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans -- issues which have been a sore point in relations even after the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>All parties hailed the declaration as a starting point to develop the kind of normal relations Germany has already established with other countries occupied by the Nazis over 50 years ago, notably France and Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a matter of saying that this episode of our history has been put to rest. It was and is about speaking openly about those issues which could make our common future difficult,&quot; Kohl told deputies in a parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>&quot;This declaration should however -- with all respect to hurt feelings -- make a contribution to reconciliation. It should help to break out of the vicious circle of settling scores and mutual recriminations,&quot; Kohl said.</p>
<p>Only the Christian Social Union (CSU), which acts as political mentor for the survivors and relatives of the &quot;Sudeten Germans&quot; expelled from the Czech lands, struck a jarring note saying the pact did not fully address the expellees' plight.</p>
<p>The CSU is the sister party of Kohl's Christian Democrats in the state of Bavaria, which shares a border with the Czech Republic and where many Sudeten Germans migrated after the war.</p>
<p>Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber welcomed the declaration as a &quot;building block&quot; for future good relations, but said it failed to portray fully the suffering of ethnic Germans.</p>
<p>He complained that the text did not give them the right to return to their homeland or to compensation for confiscated property: &quot;This would not have sparked a mass exodus back to the Czech Republic, as some feared in that country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the Sudeten Germans had been drawn closer into the negotiations, they would have shed many of their reservations.&quot;</p>
<p>Deputies from the opposition Greens and Social Democrats (SPD) joined Kohl in calling on the Sudeten Germans to accept the accord.</p>
<p>It took two years of talks to draw up the final text, which is still controversial in both countries. In the Czech Republic, far-right Republicans and communists oppose it.</p>
<p>The leader of Prague's opposition Social Democrats (CSSD), the SPD's ideological kin, came to Bonn this week to ask for a rider to the pact to allay concerns that it does not affirm the legal validity of the post-war expulsion of the Germans and the confiscation of their property.</p>
<p>The SPD took account of the CSSD's view by proposing a motion in which each side would have expressed its respect for the other's legal system, but the motion was rejected.</p>
<p>The CSSD could block approval of the accord in the Prague parliament next month, but has not said it will do so.</p>
<p>In the declaration, Germany also expresses its support for Czech membership of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</p>
<p>There were 578 votes in favour of the declaration, 20 against and 23 abstentions.</p>
