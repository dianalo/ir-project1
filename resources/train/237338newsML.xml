<headline>U.S. Mid-Atlantic spot power rises on cold, natgas.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spot prices of wholesale electricity in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. rose Thursday, extending recent gains amid the ongoing rally in natural gas prices and forecasts of colder-than-normal weather next week.</p>
<p>Friday temperatures in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool were predicted to again peak in 30s-40s Fahrenheit and bottom in the 20s-30s.</p>
<p>Extended forecasts indicated temperatures would run four to eight degrees below normal this weekend. Snow and/or sleet would fall in parts of the PJM region.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not going to break above freezing this weekend,&quot; a PJM trader said.</p>
<p>Domestic natgas prices continued this week's bounce on the cold weather forecast as well as American Gas Association's report which showed a sharp drawdrown in U.S. underground storage facilities last week.</p>
<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures jumped 15.5 cents to $3.660 per million British thermal units in midday trading. Swing PJM gas prices was assessed in the $4.70 area.</p>
<p>Firm, peak PJM electricity for Friday was quoted at $25.50-$26.50 a megawatt hour (MWh) with most deals heard done in the $25.50-$26.50 range.</p>
<p>Today's quote was higher than Wednesday's $25.00-$25.75 for Thursday delivery.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak PJM electricity was still notationally assessed at $15.00-$16.00.</p>
<p>&quot;Utilities were trying to fill their needs tomorrow,&quot; said a PJM broker, referring to the rise in next-day peak prices.</p>
<p>A 550 kilovolt (KV) transmission line in southern PJM was shut just today for maintenance. The outage did not ignite PJM hourly dispatch rate, which hovered in the low $20 level.</p>
<p>A 850 megawatt (MW) unit at the Conemaugh coal-fired generating station in western Pennsylvania was planned to return to service today after being shut last Friday to repair a boiler tube leak.</p>
<p>PJM electricity for delivery next week was talked at $26.75-$27.50.</p>
<p>PJM power deliveries for the balance of December were valued at $27.25-$28.25, up from $26.75-$27.75 Wednesday.</p>
<p>January/February 1997 PJM electricity was pegged near $33.00 after reaching as high as $33.00. The quote compared with Wednesday's $32.50-$32.60.</p>
<p>March 1997 PJM deliveries were quoted at $26.00-$26.40 after hitting a high of $26.80. Today's range compared with Wednesday's $25.80-$26.20.</p>
<p>Second-quarter 1997 PJM remained at $22.80-$22.90.</p>
<p>July/August 1997 PJM power held steady at $32.00-$32.35. Third-quarter 1997 PJM climbed to $28.60-$29.00, up from $28.30-$28.60 Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter 1997 PJM electricity rose to $24.00-$24.40, higher than Wednesday's $23.85-$24.15.</p>
<p>Calendar 1997 PJM deliveries during peak hours were still thinly discussed at $26.30-$26.60. Calendar 1997 PJM flat deliveries held at $20.90-$21.20.</p>
<p>The 833 MW Beaver Valley 2 nuclear power plant remained in &quot;hot&quot; shutdown mode after its startup from a refueling outage was interrupted Tuesday to repair a vessel head vent system. It is uncertain when the unit would restart again.</p>
