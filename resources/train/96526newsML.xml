<p>The man who has earned the nickname &quot;Dr. Death&quot; for helping people die showed earlier this week he can administer other medical services, too.</p>
<p>Dr. Jack Kevorkian was the first person on the scene of an accident near his home in suburban Detroit on Tuesday, Oct. 1., and provided first aid to a bicyclist who he said likely suffered a fractured skull after his bike hit a car.</p>
<p>Kevorkian was not happy that his Good Samaritan deed reached the press on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish this wouldn't get out because you know the kind of jokes that will come,&quot; he told the Oakland Press. &quot;They'll say the guy looked up and thought it was worse than it was.&quot;</p>
<p>But Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's attorney, wasn't shy about touting Kevorkian's good works.</p>
<p>&quot;He helps suffering human beings,&quot; Fieger told the paper. &quot;If someone's not near death, he helps them too.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevorkian, a 68-year-old, retired pathologist, has admitted attending the deaths of at least 41 people since he began a crusade in 1990 to have physician-assisted suicide legalised.</p>
