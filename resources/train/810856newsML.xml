<headline>Judge OKs &quot;trauma&quot; lawsuit against Disney Co..</headline>
<dateline>SANTA ANA, Calif 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>A California woman was told Friday she could sue Walt Disney Co. because her grandchildren were &quot;traumatized&quot; by seeing Disney characters take their costumes off.</p>
<p>An Orange County judge ruled that a lawsuit by Billie Jean Matay, a former Mouseketeer, whose family was robbed of $1,650 in the parking lot at Disneyland in 1995, could go ahead with her suit.</p>
<p>In it, Matay charges that her three grandchildren, aged 5 to 11, were traumatized by being taken away after the robbery to a backstage area where Disney characters took their costumes off.</p>
<p>Orange Country Superior Court Judge Richard Luesebrink refused to throw out Matay's lawsuit, even though Disney lawyers argued that there was nothing traumatic about a &quot;cartoon character taking off a cartoon character costume.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's ridiculous. I don't want to fight a cause of action that doesn't exist,&quot; Disney lawyer Stephren Waimey said.</p>
<p>Matay's lawyers argued that Disneyland had to protect children from emotional distress -- such as that caused by seeing Mickey Mouse without his head on.</p>
<p>The suit, which will be heard Aug. 18, also alleges that poor security at Disneyland led to the robbery.</p>
