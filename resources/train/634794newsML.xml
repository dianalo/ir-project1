<p>UK gilts may face a 'double whammy' of interest rate and tax rises over the next few weeks, a prospect which should hammer the yield curve as flat as a pancake, analysts said.</p>
<p>But gilts have one great advantage -- Britain, with its opt-out from a single European currency, stands aloof from the torment and confusion in Europe. That should mean UK bonds outstrip their Continental counterparts.</p>
<p>Philip Tyson, bond analyst at HSBC Markets, said the gilt curve had already flattened last week and outperformed Europe, with yields rising modestly across the board but most noticeably at the short-end.</p>
<p>&quot;Near-term, this flattening is set to continue, particularly as the domestic focus turns to the first meeting of the Bank of England's new Monetary Policy Committee,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new committee, granted power over rates by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, meets on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Four Bank of England members will sit alongside two outsiders -- academics Charles Goodhart and Willem Buiter. Another Bank deputy governor will be appointed and join the committee at a later date, as will two more outsiders.</p>
<p>Tyson said base rates would not be raised from 6.25 percent this time although he thought it was a &quot;close call.&quot;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fear of higher rates would cut the spread between five- and 10-year gilt yields to as little as 10 basis points from 15 now, he said.</p>
<p>Kevin Adams, gilts analyst at BZW, said the odds of a rate rise were pretty evenly balanced. The committee would be inclined to wait for Brown's July 2 budget, he said, and the strength of the pound, still squeezing British exporters, also gave good grounds for caution.</p>
<p>&quot;With all the turmoil in Europe, the last thing they should want is to highlight the pound as a safe haven currency by raising rates.&quot;</p>
<p>But against that, domestic demand is sky-high, being given another leg up on Monday as the former Halifax building society showered millions of members with shares worth 17 billion pounds as it floated on the stock market.</p>
<p>Whether interest rates rise this week or not, economists are urging Brown to raise taxes and take the pressure off monetary policy to rein in soaring high street spending. Higher taxes would also offer the advantage of not pushing the pound higher.</p>
<p>Adams said the budget projections for Britain's public sector debt would help gilts from the supply point of view. Economists expect the 19.2 billion stg deficit forecast for 1997/98 in last November's budget to be revised down to 15 billion or lower. &quot;But the key thing is how much Brown does to restrain the consumer.&quot;</p>
<p>The prospect of policy tightening from both the monetary and fiscal wings makes curve-flattening trades a safe bet. &quot;Monday's budget announcement...could compound the flattening process as the long end benefits from fresh overseas inflows,&quot; Tyson said.</p>
<p>Adams agreed. He said the two- to 10-year gilt spread could narrow to 25 basis points or lower, from above 30 now. &quot;That's a safer trade even than betting on a narrower gilt/Bund spread.&quot;</p>
<p>But that too looked a likely prospect, with European bonds battered by uncertainty about the timetable for European Economic and Monetary Union, following a resounding left-wing victory in French elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>That, together with a German accounting ploy to revalue gold reserves and cut its budget deficit, has also raised fears of a fudged start for EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;That should be good for gilts,&quot; Adams said, adding  it was tough to read the EMU situation from a trading perspective. For instance, should investors buy Spanish bonds on the basis that the process went ahead on a laxer basis, allowing Spain in at the start?</p>
<p>If they did, they risked losing if strict rules were still applied, excluding Spain, or if EMU was delayed -- bad news for all European bonds. Gilt investors could remain blissfully free of those concerns.</p>
<p>As a result, Adams said the yield differential between 10-year gilts and Bunds could retest 132 basis points, the low it reached after Britain's Labour Party stormed to election victory on May 1. The spread was at 139 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As for the long gilt future, up 18/32 on the day at 113-14, technical analysts said it could target 113-30, the high posted on May 21. &quot;There's not a lot of resistance until we get up to 113-30, but I don't think we'll quite get there today,&quot; said Mark Ostwald at London Bond Broking.</p>
