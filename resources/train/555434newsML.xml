<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>

<p>Bonds ambled weaker in late Friday trade after a lacklustre day characterised by a general lack of interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT the yield on the key R150 stock was pegged at 14.80 percent from 14.755 percent on Wednesday. Local markets were closed on Thursday for a public holiday.</p>
<p>In the morning session, the market was constrained by the noon options close-out, which hemmed yields into a tight range around the 14.75 percent strike level.</p>
<p>&quot;The options close-out went fairly smoothly, no hiccoughs, but it was generally a quiet morning,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>After noon, the market awaited the release of U.S April employment data to see what impact it would have on the resurgent U.S. Treasury bond market.</p>
<p>U.S. Labour Department data showed non-farm payrolls rose 142,000 in the month, compared with analysts expectations of a 211,000 rise.</p>
<p>However, the local market shrugged of the data's positive impact on U.S. bonds and the R150 drifted higher -- pressured by players cutting long positions after the close-out and a general lack of interest with many players on leave for a long weekend.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was now looking to the release of latest gold and foreign exchange reserves data, due for release at 1600 GMT, for direction.</p>
<p>Economists generally expect reserves to have risen from the 13.12 billion rand registered in March.</p>
<p>Dealers said the data would provide direction for the market early next week when they expected the market to resume its stronger trend, helped by the fact that most people would be back at work.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures show foreigners were net buyers of 164.26 million rand's worth of South African bonds on Wednesday after buying 734.94 million rand's worth on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 11.03 billion rand from 10.1 billion rand previously.</p>
<p>On the currency market, the rand also weakened as exporter and London-based dollar selling failed to outweigh substantial importer demand.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, the rand was pegged at 4.4525/4555 against the dollar from 4.4450/4480 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said that in the sessions ahead, the rand looked set to adopt a weaker bias.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been consistent demand from importers which has left the market a bit short,&quot; one trader said. &quot;If we get a fantastic reserves figure it might give the rand a bit of support but it won't get below 4.4450/4475 because there is substantial demand down there.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the fact that the rand had unsuccessfully tested the downside at 4.44 over the last week also pointed to an attempt on the 4.46 to 4.47 levels early next week.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the local currency shed most of the earlier gains it built on cable's retreat, to trade only slightly firmer at 7.1915/2008 against sterling from 7.2070/2163 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the rand was last quoted at 0.3881/3885 from 0.3893/3897, and was at 28.4351/4655 yen from 28.5107/5525 yen previously.</p>
<p>Major banks kept their three month deposit rates steady at between 16.40 to 16.45 percent offered, while the 90-day BA rate was also unchanged at between 15.80 to 15.95 percent.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank said the money market shortage rose to 9.169 billion rand on Wednesday from 8.935 billion rand on Tuesday.</p>
