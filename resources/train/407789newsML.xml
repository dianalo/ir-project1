<p>Belgium's scandal-ridden Socialist Party (PS) is visibly crumbling but has no intention of giving up power as part of the country's four-party centre-left coalition, government sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The PS is a virtual party now. Its substance has gone and will have to be rebuilt from the base up. But it will not move into opposition just now,&quot; said one government source, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Three senior party officials -- Merry Hermanus, Francois Pirot and Fernand Detaille -- are in jail in an investigation into 45 million Belgian francs ($1.3 million) in bribes alleged to have been paid by French avionics firm Dassault in the late 1980s to win a large defence contract.</p>
<p>Dassault, whose chief Serge Dassault is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by Belgium, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Guy Spitaels, chairman of the Francophone PS at the time, also denies all knowledge of the money but finally gave in to intense political pressure and resigned on Thursday from the parliament of the country's French-speaking Walloon region.</p>
<p>He had already temporarily stepped down from the presidency of the assembly -- one of four regional parliaments in linguistically-divided Belgium -- while allegations that he knew of the bribes were investigated.</p>
<p>Belgium's national Parliament voted to lift the parliamentary immunity of PS treasurer Patrick Moriau, whose name is on one of three bank accounts at Union Bank of Switzerland's Luxembourg branch which prosecutors say were used to launder the funds.</p>
<p>The fingers of blame are also increasingly pointing at current PS chairman Philippe Busquin, who likewise denies all knowledge of the money or the accounts. He faces re-election to the PS chair this weekend.</p>
<p>The allegations, similar to those concerning Italian helicopter maker Agusta which forced NATO Secretary General Willy Claes, a Flemish Socialist, to resign 18 months ago, have prompted opposition calls for the PS to quit the coalition.</p>
<p>The calls have been rejected -- not least by Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat, who has fought to keep his government intact while it tries to prepare the economy to join the European Union's single currency.</p>
<p>The EU will decide early next year which countries will make the grade at the start of 1999, the year in which, coincidentally, the next national elections are due.</p>
<p>Diplomats and political analysts said that such was Dehaene's single-minded single currency ambition that the coalition would cling on until that decision was made.</p>
<p>&quot;The PS will stay on at least until it has been decided who will be members of the Euro,&quot; a source close to the government said. &quot;Once that is known the glue keeping the coalition together will weaken considerably.&quot;</p>
<p>The Liberals, the main opposition grouping, have suggested that they should simply replace the Socialists in the coalition, thereby avoiding early elections.</p>
<p>But Dehaene, aware that this would be taken as a sign of weakness by the money markets, has rejected the proposal. The Belgian franc has already come under light but sustained pressure because of the political woes.</p>
