<p>Transport Secretary Sir George Young said on Tuesday the government was to look at the possibility of changing Britain's car number plate system after industry complaints that it harms competitiveness.</p>
<p>Young published a consultative document detailing a range of possible alternatives to the present system under which the initial letter of plates for new cars changes each August.</p>
<p>The industry says this system, which will continue until 2004 unless the government intervenes, is inefficient and costly because it leads to a huge swell of car sales each August, forcing manufacturers to stockpile cars in advance.</p>
<p>&quot;We have...agreed to look at the possibility of bringing the present cycle to an end sooner and replacing it with a system which would avoid the August sales peak,&quot; Young said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said that if the government did introduce a new system before 2004, it &quot;would look to the industry to finance the additional costs involved&quot;.</p>
<p>Among the options canvassed in the consultative document are keeping a letter which identifies the age of cars but changing it every three or six months, number plates which show the area of the country where a car was purchased, and plates which identify both age and area.</p>
<p>The Transport Department is asking for comments on the document by March 21.</p>
