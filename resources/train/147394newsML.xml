<p>A prominent human rights group renewed its opposition to a complete amnesty for Guatemala's army and its leftist guerrillas on Monday on the eve of new peace talks between the government and rebels.</p>
<p>The Alliance Against Impunity expressed concern that peace negotiators may have agreed during top-secret talks to an amnesty for soldiers and guerrillas who violated human rights.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiation should ... create conditions so that common crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the army and the (guerrillas) are not repeated,&quot; Miguel Angel Alvisures, an alliance spokesman, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Government peace negotiators travel to Mexico City on Tuesday to meet exiled commanders of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) for a final session of talks on the future of Guatemala's guerrilla fighters. Both sides expect to sign a definitive peace agreement in December, putting into effect 11 separate accords and formally ending Central America's longest ongoing civil war, which has left 100,000 dead and more than 40,000 unaccounted for since 1961.</p>
<p>The talks this week are about legalising the outlawed URNG and allowing the rebels to form a political party. The URNG is an umbrella group of four guerrilla fronts, formed in 1982.</p>
<p>An estimated 1,000 fighters and commanders live in hiding or in exile. Top government peace negotiator Gustavo Porras told reporters last week that both sides were working hard to find a legal framework for a partial amnesty.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to do exclusively with those events that are considered directly linked to the armed conflict and not events that had nothing to do with it,&quot; Porras said.</p>
<p>He named several notorious political assassinations and massacres blamed on the army and said none of them would be considered directly linked to the war. He also said any amnesty would allow victims' families to appeal to a court that would decide whether or not a crime fell under amnesty.</p>
<p>The United Nations has moderated sporadic peace talks since 1991 but they picked up this year with a ceasefire. In September rebels and the government signed a landmark agreement reducing Guatemala's powerful army by one third.</p>
