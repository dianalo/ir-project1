<p>Compaq Computer Corp. said Tuesday it expects its business in Europe to expand faster than the overall market in 1997 as it broadens its product lines to reach new consumer and corporate customers.</p>
<p>The company plans to launch 130 new products in Europe in the second half of the year -- including a series of home personal computers -- while streamlining its distribution operations, Andreas Barth, Compaq's general manager for Europe said at a strategy briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we can grow faster than the rest of the market,&quot; Barth said. &quot;One of our goals this year is to gain market share.&quot;</p>
<p>With Compaq's second-quarter results due Thursday and its stock up $5.06 at $119.56 on the New York Stock Exchange, Barth also said European business was &quot;relatively good&quot; in the quarter.</p>
<p>He declined to say if the results this week would meet expectations, citing the quiet period required by U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p>Barth told reporters that, based on preliminary data, Compaq expected its European market share to rise to 15.4 percent in the second quarter, from 14.8 percent.</p>
<p>Sales in the European PC market as a whole were seen rising 14 percent in the second quarter, vs. 8.4 percent in the first quarter, he said. He expected gains of 13 percent in the third quarter and 14 percent in the fourth.</p>
<p>Compaq's earnings report was expected to be a key indicator for computer stocks. In May, chipmaker Intel Corp. warned that its second-quarter results would not exceed the first-quarter levels, and cited weak European demand.</p>
<p>Compaq stumbled in Europe last year, and actually lost share in the consumer segment. Direct marketers like Dell Computer Corp. grew at much faster rates in the region and saw profits soar because of their efficient inventory and build-to-order manufacturing systems.</p>
<p>Compaq expects to spark European demand in the second half by repositioning its consumer line with a home computer priced under 1,700 marks ($1,000), new mid- and high-performance retail PCs and a portable outfitted with a CD-ROM and multimedia gear.</p>
<p>On the corporate side, Compaq will enter the market for workstations -- brawny engineering computers -- by combining Intel Corp.'s Pentium II computer chip with the Windows NT operating system from Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>In addition, it plans to add more networking products while its acquisition of Tandem Corp. will allow the company to enter the market for enterprise servers -- mainframe computers that companies use to handle critical business transactions.</p>
<p>Compaq intends to keep costs down in Europe by using built-to-order manufacturing and having some computer resellers install certain components, like memory and hard drives.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to have price parity with the direct sellers,&quot; Barth said.</p>
<p>To get consumer products ready for European markets faster, Compaq this summer will shift its local operations to Munich, Germany, and add a consumer development centre in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
<p>Bouten said these shifts should ensure home PCs arrive in time for the consumer market's seasonal shopping sprees.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of components fall so fast that, if you miss the product release by one or two months, it is very hard to make money,&quot; he said.</p>
