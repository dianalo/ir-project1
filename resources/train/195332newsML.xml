<p>Leftist groups may be planning to clash with police when the Philippines holds next week's Asia-Pacific summit, organisers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Filipino officials say the summit will be an opportunity for the country to showcase its economic rebirth and potential as Asia's next tiger after cycles of boom-and-bust that once gave it a reputation as of Asia's economic laggards.</p>
<p>Philippine organising committee director-general Lisandro Abadia said there were no intelligence reports that any foreign extremist groups would disrupt the summit but potential trouble could come from local leftist protesters.</p>
<p>&quot;What I heard is that these hard-headed people will not go to designated demonstration areas but their plan is to foul-bait, taunt our law enforcers,&quot; the former Philippine armed forces chief said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why my instruction to law enforcers is don't be intimidated by these people, don't be provoked...we really must keep our cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, who spoke in the same interview, said leftist groups were bent on creating &quot;a happening&quot; to embarrass the government.</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy is maximum tolerance. We will allow them to air their grievances but we will not allow them to commit acts of violence or create disorder and chaos,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lim is a former police chief, once labelled the Philippines' &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; after the trigger-happy Hollywood detective played by Clint Eastwood for his tough handling of law breakers.</p>
<p>Leaders of 16 of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members are expected to attend the November 25 summit at Subic Bay freeport northwest of Manila.</p>
<p>The summit, which will discuss ways of achieving the APEC dream of creating the world's biggest free trade bloc, will be preceded by meetings in Manila of APEC ministers and senior officials.</p>
<p>Lim appealed to protesters to help ensure the success of the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's not disrupt the APEC meeting. It is not only the govvernment or President (Fidel) Ramos that will be embarrassed but the entire  Fillipino people. Let's put our best foot forward,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Leftist groups planning to organise &quot;protest caravans&quot; from Manila to Subic to coincide with the summit said allegations they planned to foment trouble were government propaganda.</p>
<p>&quot;If there will be provocation it will not come from our side. The arrest of our leader proves it is the government who is the trouble maker,&quot; Wilson Fortaleza, spokesman for the Coalition of Filipino Workers BMP, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He was referring to the arrest by government troops of BMP chief Filemon Lagman last week for alleged involvement in the 1992 killing of a policeman by suspected communist guerrillas.</p>
<p>Besides the BMP, another leftist faction and a group of moderates, which are to hold parallel anti-APEC meetings in Manila, plan to stage protest motorcades to the summit venue. The three groups said they were mobilising tens of thousands of participants.</p>
