<title>USA: August retail sales rose weakly.</title>
<headline>August retail sales rose weakly.</headline>

<p>Sales at retail stores edged up weakly for a second month in a row during August, the Commerce Department said Friday, as an expected rebound in auto sales last month failed to show up.</p>
<p>Total retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $205 billion -- well below Wall Street economists' forecasts of a 0.7 percent increase -- after a slight 0.1 percent gain in July.  </p>

<p>During August, sales of new cars were up only 0.1 percent to $49.7 billion after being flat in July. New cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales, so swings in demand strongly affect the overall monthly figures.</p>
<p>Excluding cars, retail sales rose 0.2 percent during each of July and August.</p>
<p>Domestic automakers previously reported brisk sales in August, which led analysts to anticipate a strong rise in overall monthly retail business. Some of the car dealers' sales data may not yet have been captured by the government's monthly survey.</p>
<p>August sales of all types of durable goods, including cars, were up 0.3 percent to $83.8 billion after a 0.2 percent July increase that previously was reported as a 0.4 percent drop.</p>
<p>Sales of nodurable goods gained 0.1 percent in August to $121.2 billion after being unchanged in July.</p>
<p>There were some signs of spending strength in the August report, though not enough to boost overall sales.</p>
<p>Sales by general merchandise stores rose 0.7 percent to $25.9 billion after a 0.2 percent increase in July. At apparel stores, sales of clothing climbed solidly by one percent to $9.5 billion after dropping 0.7 percent in July.</p>
<p>The Olympics were blamed for depressed sales in July, as consumers apparently stayed home to watch television rather than travel to shopping malls.</p>
<p>In its latest Beige Book report on the economy issued on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said the August back-to-school shopping season was off to a good start and sales in many parts of the country surpassed retailers' expectations.</p>
<p>Sales of building materials fell 0.7 percent last month to $11.4 billion after a 0.2 percent increase in July. Costlier interest rates are expected to slow the housing industry in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Sales by food stores dropped 0.7 percent in August to $35.2 billion following a 0.9 percent July rise.</p>
<p>Gasoline service station sales fell 0.9 percent to $12.9 billion after plunging 1.8 percent in July.</p>
