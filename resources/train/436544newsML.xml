<headline>Sylvan, Nat'l Ed. stock drops unjustified - analysts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The acquisition by Sylvan Learning Systems Inc of National Education Corp is a good one offering many potential benefits, and Wednesday's fall in both share prices is misguided, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;I am favorably inclined to this deal,&quot; said Brandt Sakakeeny, an analyst at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Sylvan, known for its Sylvan Learning Centers, said earlier it will issue 0.58 new shares for each National Education share in an agreed deal.</p>
<p>But Sylvan stock tumbled 5-1/4 to 29-7/8 on Nasdaq by the close. National Education, halted by the New York Stock Exchange in early trading, closed down 5/8 at 16-3/8 on Wednesday having run up 50 percent in the preceding week.</p>
<p>The fall in Sylvan's stock cuts the deal value for National Education to about $17 a share on Wednesday, down from the over $20, or $675 million total, the deal was worth when announced using Tuesday's closing prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;My feeling is very different from the market's about this deal,&quot; said Michael Moe, an analyst at Montgomery Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a potential home run, there are tremendous benefits from putting the companies together,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>They said that the two companies had complementary skills and Sylvan would benefit greatly from being able to distribute National Education's educational content.</p>
<p>Analysts said the knee-jerk reaction of the market came from a blending of the firms' historic earnings growth rates.</p>
<p>Sylvan has typically grown earnings per share at 35 percent a year while National Education has grown at 15 percent, and accounting for the larger size of National Education would give a blended rate of 25 percent, apparently justifying a lower price earnings ratio.</p>
<p>&quot;But National Education was poised for growth even without Sylvan,&quot; said Moe. They had really cleaned themselves up over the last two years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sylvan combined with National Education is very different from National Education alone,&quot; Sakakeeny said.</p>
<p>Shareholders of National Education, whose ICS Learning Systems division is the world's largest provider of education through the mail or computers, would hold about 47 percent of the fully diluted common stock of the combined company.</p>
<p>One analyst, who declined to be identified, noted that news of the deal had clearly leaked out because National Education's stock soared from $12-1/2 to $17, an almost 50 percent rise, in the week before the deal was announced. (( Nick Louth, New York Newsroom 212 859 1712))</p>
