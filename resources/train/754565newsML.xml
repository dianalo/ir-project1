<p>The European Commission said on Thursday it had given the German authorities a month to clarify whether French oil company Elf Aquitaine received excessive subsidies to build the Leuna refinery in east Germany.</p>
<p>The statement, which follows a decision by the full Commission on Wednesday to start a formal investigation into the issue, quotes press reports as saying the cost of building the refinery may have been inflated by almost a billion marks.</p>
<p>German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt regretted the Commission's decision. &quot;From my point of view this step would not be needed to clear up the matter further,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Elf has valued the cost of building the plant at 3.3 billion marks, the Commission said. But the German press quoted a report carried by BvS, the body responsible for privatising state-owned assets in the former East Germany, as saying that the &quot;normal&quot; price was 2.4 billion marks, the Commission said.</p>
<p>The company says it received total subsidies of 1.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said Bonn had answered all the Commission's questions about the case and had also handed over the findings of the BvS probe. But the Commission's statement said the information received was &quot;insufficient&quot;.</p>
<p>Rexrodt added that an investigation by state prosecutors had also failed to find any evidence that government subsidies had been granted to fictitious investment projects, and that the case had been closed.</p>
<p>The Commission also requested information on the acquisition by BvS of 33 percent of the shares in the refinery from Elf Aquitaine. BvS has a &quot;call-option&quot; to buy that participation once the refinery begins operations, which is expected to happen in October.</p>
<p>&quot;We must check that the sum that BvS will pay is not too high,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Commission must clear any plans by EU national governments or local authorities to subsidise their industry. It may re-open decisions clearing any such plans if it gets evidence that too much aid has been paid.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said he hoped the Brussels probe would be completed quickly.</p>
