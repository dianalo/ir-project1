<p>The interim results are in from the Vilnius bourse's premier five-stock official list and they are all in the black.</p>
<p>But the market's response to the spate of promising figures has been snail-paced at best and throws its problems into sharp releif, dealers and analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They include low levels of local liquidity, a limited foreign presence and the failure of many companies to convince investors that will be profitable in the long-term.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors are too small to move the market and foreign institutional investors are not present,&quot; said Kestutis Kupshys, a dealer with Mendes Prior Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is developing, but very slowly,&quot; said Kupshys. &quot;Even the release of half-year results is not a factor that can change that fundamental situation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is still a very young market; it doesn't work like a developed market,&quot; said Saulius Racevichius, director of the financial brokerage department at Vilniaus Bank.</p>
<p>Brokers say that results are important but that most companies lack proven track records that could justify quick decisions based on interim results.</p>
<p>Many of the lesser known companies lack transparancy and the market is often wary of their announcements.</p>
<p>And good results are expected from the leading companies so few people get excited about them.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been nothing unexpected for an investor who is following the (official list) companies because they are transparent ,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Lithuania's bourse did see a mild recovery of turnover in the wake of six-month results by the country's premier commercial banks, Vilniaus Bank and Hermis Bank, but other blue chips have failed to stir the market.</p>
<p>Rokishkis Cheese announced on Monday its profits rose to 9.467 million litas from 1.253 million litas in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The market's response?</p>
<p>Rokishkis shares held steady at 42 litas on Tuesday before slipping to 41.50 litas on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In what may be a delayed reaction, it firmed to 43 litas on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brokers say they expect Rokishkis share prices to live up to the company's results but stress that it will take time.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long term, Rokishkis share prices will increase,&quot; said Paulius Dumshe, an analyst with Suprema.</p>
<p>But brokers say the situation is improving.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at last year, it took something like three or four months (for the market to react to results),&quot; Dumshe said.</p>
<p>Reaction time now takes &quot;up to one month.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on the company,&quot; Dumshe said. &quot;In the case of Vilniaus Bank, it was the first and most known bank in Lithuania, so reaction time is short.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still undervalued and underdeveloped,&quot; Kupshys said. &quot;But that's the time for the investment process to begin.&quot;</p>
