<p>The House Banking Committee voted on Wednesday to amend financial sector reform legislation to allow commercial companies to engage in a limited amount of banking activity.</p>
<p>The close 25 to 23 vote followed the committee's adoption on Tuesday of a similiar amendment that would allow banks to engage in a limited amount of commercial activity.</p>
<p>Rep Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, said he introduced the amendment to provide equal treatment for commercial and financial companies. &quot;That's just allowing what's good for the goose to be good for the gander,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the amendment, refered to as a &quot;reverse basket,&quot; a commercial company could acquire a single bank as long as the company did not derive more than 15 percent of its gross revenues from banking. Commercial companies could only own banks in existence for at least five years and with total assets of not exceeding $500 million.  </p>
<p>Committee chairman Jim Leach, a staunch opponent of mixing banking and commerce, warned that the amendment could put at risk the government-backed deposit insurance fund.</p>
<p>Under the amendment, the Federal Reserve would not be able to monitor or regulate commercial companies that owned banks, the Iowa republican said.</p>
<p>&quot;The taxpayer and the federal safety net may not be adequately covered because there is no consolidated oversight of the entire organization,&quot; Leach said.</p>
<p>The vote was considerably closer than Tuesday's 35 to 19 vote in favor of allowing bank holding companies to derive up to 15 percent of their revenue from commercial activity.</p>
<p>Rep Ken Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, was one lawmaker who voted for the first amendment but against the McCollum proposal. Allowing commercial companies into banking would allow far more mixing of banking and commerce in the economy than the reverse, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are going beyond a two-way street to a superhighway.&quot;  </p>
<p>The committee adjourned for a short break after the vote on Wednesday, but still has dozens of amendments to consider as it debates legislation to eliminate the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act and modernize aging U.S. bank laws.</p>
<p>The committee has not begun debate on other controversial amendments, including proposals to retain a separate federal charter for savings and loan institutions, alter the regulation of bank insurance sales, and impose additional consumer protection rules on financial services companies.</p>
<p>Mixing banking and commerce has been one of the most controversial issues in the bank reform debate this year. Proponents on the banking committee had to scale back their initial proposals.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration had been leaning in favor of allowing banking and commerce earlier this year, but last month in its bank reform proposal it did not take a definitive position. Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato has sponsored legislation in the Senate allowing mixing.</p>
