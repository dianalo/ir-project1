<p>A bomb was thrown at Albanian President Sali Berisha during a campaign rally outside Tirana but was caught by a bodyguard and deactivated, state television said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The television said the assassination attempt was made at 18:20 p.m. (1620 GMT) while Berisha was making an appearance in the village of Shkallnuer, about 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana near the port of Durres.</p>
<p>A suspect was captured and was being treated at hospital, the television added. A statement from Berisha's Democratic Party later said the explosive device was a grenade.</p>
<p>Berisha denounced the attempt as &quot;an ugly act with which the terrorists aimed to take the lives of as many people as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>The incident came just two days after 20 people were wounded in a powerful blast at a Tirana cafe frequented by followers of the Socialist Party, which represents the biggest challenge to Berisha's party in June 29 elections.</p>
<p>The early elections were called after Albania was swept by riots last March sparked by the collapse of shady pyramid investment schemes. Armouries were looted and it is estimated up to 1,000 people have been killed since in the Balkan state.</p>
<p>Security in Tirana was vastly increased after the cafe bombing, with dozens of police guarding some of the capital's main intersections and occasionally stopping and searching passing cars.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to denounce terrorism...because terrorism is the most immoral weapon of lost people who belong to the darkest strata of society,&quot; Berisha said in a statement to the television after he returned to Tirana.</p>
<p>He appealed to the Albanian people &quot;to stay calm and commit themselves to waging this electoral campaign with dignity and to take Albania to elections&quot;.</p>
<p>The television showed footage of the president, who is fighting for his political life in elections planned in a climate of fear caused by the huge number of looted arms, stepping to one side of a stage as the device was hurled at him.</p>
<p>It showed one bodyguard lunging to catch the device while others jumped on a man in the crowd. The television quoted local officials as saying the man was a known &quot;extremist&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the man, whose name was not released, was being treated in hospital but the television gave no information about how he was injured.</p>
<p>The television said the rally continued attempt and that people had formed a human wall to protect the president.</p>
<p>Because of the riots, which devastated much of Albania's economy, Berisha was forced to agree to early elections and appoint an interim multi-party government of national reconciliation.</p>
<p>The international community, with the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) leading the way, plans to monitor the elections to prevent widespread fraud that marred the last parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>A 6,500-strong Italian-led multinational force is in Albania to give a semblance of stability.</p>
