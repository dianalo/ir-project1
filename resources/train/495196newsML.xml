<p>The Australian dollar ended with a bounce Tuesday after staving off persistent bearish pressure which saw it carve out six week lows at one stage.</p>
<p>Traders said it was hard to find a fund with a good word to say on the currency now that U.S. and Australian interest rates were on a converging track and were choosing to take profits on long A$ positions to cover losses in U.S. stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>But despite the air of gloom, US$0.7735 support held through the session partly thanks to steady buying from local exporters and partly to a worldwide rush out of mark and yen which made the local dollar look like a safe haven in comparison.  </p>
<p>By 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the dollar had rallied to US$0.7772/77 from an early US$0.7730/35 trough, its lowest level since February 21, and was up on Monday's late US$0.7754/59.</p>
<p>Traders said resistance was expected around US$0.7790, which capped a rally offshore overnight, and the currency needed to clear old support at US$0.7810 to repair the technical damage caused by last week's one cent slide.</p>
<p>Until then the risk would be for a test of the US$0.7720 chart level and a deeper retracement to US$0.7680.</p>
<p>The picture was brighter on the crosses where investors were once again fleeing the yen and low yielding European currencies.  </p>
<p>The yen was hammered after recent comments from U.S. officials suggested they were sanguine about a strong U.S. dollar and Japanese officials reaffirmed the relaxed monetary policy stance of the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>The mark and Swiss franc, meanwhile, suffered from renewed market confidence in the process of European Monetary Union which tarnished their attraction as safe haven currencies.</p>
<p>The result was a surge to 97.75/85 yen and 1.3302/15 marks for the local currency, from 96.68/78 and 1.3197/10 late here Monday. In trade weighted terms it climbed to 60.1 from a previous 59.9 close.  </p>
<p>Traders said real Australian yields were high enough to attract some of those funds, particularly as hordes of Japanese investors were hungry for higher returns now the new financial year was underway.</p>
<p>However, the demand was unlikely to be anything like as heavy as last year when issuance of yen/A$ dual currency samurai bonds reached record levels. This was because the yield premium offered by Australian bonds over U.S. assets had narrowed sharply, especially in the favoured short end of the curve. The gap between two-year bond yields, for instance, had contracted to just 17 basis points from more than 50 a few weeks ago.  </p>
<p>And the differential was likely to narrow further if, as many suspected, the Federal Reserve raised its 5.50 percent funds rate again in May.</p>
<p>For this reason, analysts at Dresdner Australia said they had revised down their forecast for the dollar to 78 cents by end-June from a previous 82 cents.</p>
<p>However, they noted that U.S. rates were only rising because the economy was proving so strong and combined with signs of accelerating growth in Europe and Japan, boded well for commodity prices and the Australian dollar in the longer term.</p>
