<p>Germany's manufacturing sector grew at  a slower pace in July according to a BME/Reuters survey which analysts  said indicates the Bundesbank will refrain from an interest rate rise  unless the mark keeps weakening.</p>
<p>The BME/Reuters German Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for July fell  to a seasonally-adjusted 55.32 from 56.83 in June.</p>
<p>The index signalled strong growth because it remained well above 50  -- the level which reflects stagnation -- but the drop in July indicated  a slight weakening in growth for the second month running, research  group NTC Publications said.</p>
<p>The rates of expansion for new orders, output, prices and employment  all weakened, NTC said. The PMI is modelled on the closely-watched  U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index.</p>
<p>Economists said the data showed Germany's economy remained split between  a booming export sector driven by the weakness of the mark and a stagnating  domestic sector restrained by high unemployment as firms kept shedding  jobs in efficiency drives.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, the Bundesbank was only likely to raise interest  rates if the mark continued to weaken to levels which would heighten  the risk of importing inflation, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Further significant weakening of the Deutschmark is the precondition  for any Bundesbank action on rates,&quot; David Brickman, European economist  at Yamaichi in London, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Financial markets have begun speculating that the Bundesbank may raise  its main money market rate, the repo rate, as early as next week to  stem the decline in the mark which has slid 20 percent against the  dollar this year.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading around 1.85 marks on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the mark remains below the level of 1.85 marks the Bundesbank  will not rock the boat and hike interest rates,&quot; said Ralph Sueppel,  head of economic research at JP Morgan in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the case for an increase in the repo would be given if the  dollar continues to rise at the same pace as it has over the past  two months.&quot;</p>
<p>A dollar at 1.90 marks at the end of the Bundesbank's four-week summer  recess on August 21 may prompt the bank to increase its 3.00 percent  repo rate by 30 basis, Sueppel said.</p>
<p>The bank may then shift from a fixed-rate repo tender -- in which  the Bundesbank sets the rate itself -- to a variable-rate system,  in which the rate is the result of bank's bids for Bundesbank money.</p>
<p>The rate has been fixed at 3.00 percent since August 1996.</p>
<p>The employment index component of the BME/Reuters index fell to a  seasonally-adjusted 48.11 from 49.26, reflecting continued job losses  for the second month running.</p>
<p>&quot;Firms remained reluctant to take on new staff, despite rising sales,  preferring to further reduce costs through rationalisation of the  workforce,&quot; NTC said.</p>
<p>Input prices rose for the sixth month running but the rate of increase  was the slowest pace recorded since April.</p>
<p>New export orders rose to the highest level yet recorded by the survey,  which began in April 1996 and showed the strongest monthly improvement  in export order books to date, NTC said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand was reported to have risen in European, Asian and U.S. markets,  driven largely by the increased competitiveness arising from the weaker  exchange rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately, the Federal Statistics Office said German wholesale sales  rose by one percent in real terms in the first six months. In June,  wholesale sales rose 5.4 percent year-on-year.</p>
