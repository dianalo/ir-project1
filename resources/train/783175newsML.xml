<p>Swedish appliance maker Electrolux said on Wednesday sales volumes of whitegoods would be largely unchanged in the rest of 1997.</p>
<p>The company also said it expected a profit in its U.S. operations this year but saw no sign of a pick up in the German market, which accounts for about 30 percent of whitegoods sales in Europe.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be approximately at these levels for the rest of the year,&quot; company chief executive Michael Treschow told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is anything besides unchanged it will be a little better,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the biggest problem was Germany, where no upturn was seen.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest worry is Germany and we see no signs of improvement there. It does not just have to do with demand -- we also see a trend towards cheaper and cheaper goods,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Operations in the U.S. looked better, however.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that we are going to make money on our U.S. operations this year and we have not done that for a long time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But U.S. whitegoods specifically was not making a profit he said, but added it was going significantly better.</p>
<p>Treschow said the group's total sales in July were good.</p>
<p>&quot;The third quarter has begun with good sales volumes, especially in North America, but also in Europe with the exception of Germany,&quot; he said.</p>
