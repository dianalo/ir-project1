<headline>U.S. Senate bill on &quot;comp time&quot; stalled.</headline>

<p>The U.S. Senate was deadlocked Wednesday over efforts to reach agreement on a &quot;workplace flexiblity&quot; bill that would allow workers to take time off rather than receive overtime pay.</p>
<p>Republicans, who sponsored the bill, say it gives hourly wage workers, especially working mothers, more flexibility and enables them to better balance work and family responsibilities.</p>
<p>It would give workers the option to take compensatory time instead of overtime pay, a choice that government workers and salaried employees already have. It would also allow for &quot;flex-time&quot;, for instance, by letting an employee work longer hours for nine days and get every other Friday off.</p>
<p>Democrats say they agree with that general goal but that this specific bill gave flexibility to the employer and not the worker. They said it essentially abolished the 40-hour workweek and could lead to coercion of workers to take the comp time even if they wanted and needed the overtime pay.</p>
<p>Democrats, joined by a few Republicans, for the second time in less than a month defeated a move to cut off debate on the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;The flexibility needs to be with the worker. It's the workers themselves that need to choose,&quot; said Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat.</p>
<p>Lead sponsor Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, said the public strongly supported his bill and he still hoped to reach some type of agreement with the Democrats.</p>
