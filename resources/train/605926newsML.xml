<title>FRANCE: Maximum sentence sought in France for ETA leaders.</title>
<headline>Maximum sentence sought in France for ETA leaders.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French state prosecutor asked a Paris court on Thursday to jail three leaders of the Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA for 10 years, the maximum sentence they face on charges of terrorist conspiracy.</p>
<p>The three, detained in the French Basque region five years ago, are on trial with 30 suspected activists or sympathisers of ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), five of whom are on the run.</p>
<p>The three main accused are Spanish citizens. One of them, Francisco &quot;Pakito&quot; Mugica Garmendia, 43, was among the most wanted men in Spain, where he is accused of sending a booby-trapped car to Madrid in 1991.</p>
<p>Spanish police regarded him as the operational chief of ETA, a group which has killed some 800 people in Spain in a three-decade-long campaign for a separate Basque state.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a trial against Basques, but against people who chose the armed struggle...They have no right to speak on behalf of the Basques,&quot; prosecutor Irene Stoller told the court.</p>
<p>The Spanish Basque country has been granted wide autonomy under Spain's devolution laws. Herri Batasuna, ETA's political wing, which opposes autonomy, gets about 15 percent of the votes in elections in the region.</p>
<p>The second main defendant, Jose Luis &quot;Txelis&quot; Alvarez Santa Cristina, 42, is believed to have been ETA's ideologist and financier, in charge of extorting &quot;revolutionary taxes&quot; from businessmen in the Spanish Basque country.</p>
<p>The third, 50-year-old Jose Maria &quot;Fiti&quot; Arregui Erostarbe, is said to be the group's expert on explosives and forged identity documents.</p>
<p>He is wanted in Spain in connection with a parcel bomb which badly maimed Fernando de Mateo Lage, presiding judge of the Audiencia Nacional anti-terrorist court, in 1990.</p>
<p>If convicted, the three leaders will serve their sentences in France before being extradited to Spain.</p>
<p>Stoller also demanded a 10-year jail sentence against Frenchman Pierre Fagant, who is accused of having harboured at his home a clandestine ETA arms workshop producing hundreds of sub-machineguns a year. He has said he was not aware of the factory.</p>
<p>She requested sentences ranging from two years suspended to eight years in prison for 24 other French and Spanish defendants accused of helping or harbouring the guerrillas. All have denied knowing what their guests were up to.</p>
<p>The prosecutor asked for six-year sentences against five suspected activists on the run.</p>
<p>The trial is due to end on Friday and the court will announce its verdict at a later date.</p>
