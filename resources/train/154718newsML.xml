<p>France rolled out the heavy guns on Wednesday in defence of its preparations for a European monetary union after charges by a key German central banker that fudging on the economic fitness tests jeopardised the entire project.</p>
<p>Amid renewed fears over Germany's own readiness and French number-crunching in its crucial 1997 budget, President Jacques Chirac vowed that both countries would do everything needed to create a single European currency on time in 1999.</p>
<p>Paris also moved swiftly to erase fears that it would not be allowed to use 37.5 billion francs ($7.35 billion) in pension funds from France Telecom to show a public deficit next year of three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in line with the Maastricht treaty terms for monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;The president said the deadlines will be met,&quot; government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said after a weekly cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the data released by certain economic institutes, the French and the German governments will both do everything necessary to respect the calendar and the conditions of the treaty on monetary union,&quot; Lamassoure quoted Chirac as saying.</p>
<p>The vow followed a flood of harmful news for monetary union -- forecasts by economic think-tanks that Germany would exceed the deficit goal, talk of opposition to French use of France Telecom cash and warnings by German central banker Raimut Jochimsen that &quot;fudging&quot; on Maastricht treaty could undermine monetary union.</p>
<p>Six influential German research institutes said on Tuesday Germany would fail to pass the Maastricht test next year because its public sector deficit was likely to be 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Cutting deficits to three percent of GDP or less is one of the key Maastricht treaty criteria for transition to the single currency, the &quot;euro&quot;, at the start of 1999.</p>
<p>However, economists read the latest remarks from Jochimsen as one more bout in the long-running battle between disciples of strict economic virtue and those who believe it is political will that will make a success of the single currency.</p>
<p>French economists said Jochimsen had highlighted Bundesbank internal splits and fears over Germany's own ability to respect the Maastricht treaty to the letter, and whether any signs of leeway there or in France would open the floodgates to countries less well prepared for monetary union.</p>
<p>The European Commission is due to say next week whether it believes the France Telecom money, which is for paying future pensions to telecoms staff, can be written into France's 1997 accounts for the purposes of the Maastricht treaty mathematics.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no reason to think the Eurostat decision will be different than what we believe right now,&quot; Lamassoure said on Wednesday after renewed worries about the plan.</p>
<p>Sources in the European Commission, to which the EU Eurostat statistics bureau is attached, said German, British and Dutch officials had recently argued against the use of the France Telecom cash at a recent EU committee talks in Brussels.</p>
<p>While France insists the move is legitimate, it has raised concerns, mainly in German quarters, that others will use some &quot;creative accounting&quot; to produce Maastricht-friendly deficits.</p>
<p>Several other European countries including Italy, Spain and Portugal have all come out with budgets recently which aim for the three percent deficit target set by the treaty.</p>
<p>The daily Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesdsay that a member of Germany's constitutional court had said there would be no room for fudging on the Maastricht treaty numbers if the court was called on to rule on the move to monetary union.</p>
<p>Economists pointed out, however, that the possibility of the court being asked to rule was well known and that five of the eight judges in that court were appointed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose desire for monetary union was unquestioned. ($1=5.102 French Franc)</p>
