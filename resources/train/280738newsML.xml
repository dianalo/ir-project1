<title>FRANCE: French capital markets closing report.</title>
<headline>French capital markets closing report.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>French bond and PIBOR futures closed unchanged, ending a very quiet session without strong impulse in either direction.</p>
<p>Dealers said the March bond contract, which had traded higher for most of the day, weakened towards the close in reaction to uncertainty in U.S. debt markets and lack of interest from foreign and domestic investors.</p>
<p>They said they expected the market to become more lively from Thursday, with the first sale of France's new 10-year benchmark bond, the 5.50 percent April 2007 OAT, along with four to six billion francs of the popular TEC 10 issue.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the market to react well to the auction.</p>
<p>The franc also weakened during the day and was trading at 3.3722 per mark at 1545 GMT compared to 3.3689 this morning.</p>
<p>Dealers said Monday's session was dull, with trading rooms lightly staffed and few calls from clients. One trader said dealers spent time playing cards.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lack of combatants,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The market was unfazed by French unemployment's November rise to a record 12.7 percent. Analysts expected unemployment to climb to about 13 percent next year before easing.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury market weakened after the release of existing home sales data and November's leading economic indicator report.</p>
<p>The weakness carried over to the French market in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dealers said the softness at the close was also a reaction to Friday's rise and to end of the year position squaring.</p>
