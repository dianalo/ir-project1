<p>White sugar futures hovered around the day's lower levels in listless trading on Tuesday and the nearby December contract was expected to retain its bearish tone despite picking up from earlier lows, traders said.</p>
<p>Activity was generally routine and volume light, with short covering suggested as the reason for the slight strength seen after the weak start to the session.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a couple of AAs but nothing out of the ordinary,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;It's found a bit of strength but there's probably still a bit more downwards movement in it.&quot;</p>
<p>December gapped 90 cents lower at the open and gradually slid lower still to touch an intraday low of $323.30.</p>
<p>At 1548 GMT December stood 90 cents lower at $324.60 with March down $1.00 at $320.70. Volume totalled 1,535 lots, concentrated in December with 1,100 lots.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said while December's resistance was pegged at $327.00, the outlook for the market could still be viewed as bearish.</p>
<p>In physical news, Sri Lanka's state buying arm, the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, bought 12,500 tonnes of white refined sugar from Kerry Foodstuffs (Pvt) Ltd of Singapore at $347 per tonne c &amp; f.</p>
<p>Shipment to Colombo is to be made before November 5.</p>
<p>The December contract also dominated activity on the Paris market, where just 292 lots were traded. It stood $1.70 lower at $324.50.</p>
