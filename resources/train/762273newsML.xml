<p>Container shipping group Atlantic Container Line AB Line said Tuesday it had been unable to find a merger partner and would continue as an independent niche carrier.</p>
<p>The New Jersey-based company, which is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, said an evaluation by U.S. bank Goldman Sachs and Norwegian shipping investment firm Fearnley Fonds had confirmed the company's current direction.</p>
<p>&quot;The work has been completed and confirmed the current strategic direction of the company and its focus on being an efficient niche carrier in its own right,&quot; ACL said in a statement.</p>
<p>However, ACL said it was exploring various potential future tax and cost efficient domiciles for the company.</p>
<p>ACL is currently domiciled in Sweden from where it was floated off from transport group Bilspedition in 1994.</p>
<p>The strategic evaluation was widely regarded as an attempt by ACL to find a merger partner following a failed $130 million bid for the company earlier this year by U.S. terminal operator Holt Cargo Systems.</p>
<p>ACL spokesman Nils Erikson said the study had shown that potential partners had not been easy to find, but that the company had not closed any doors.</p>
<p>The difficulty lay partly with the unusual nature of ACL's roll-on roll-off container ships, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to find a partner with good synergies. Our vessels are not readily integrated with other companies.&quot;</p>
<p>ACL added: &quot;The company will continue to evaluate any strategic alternatives in order to maximise the shareholders' value.&quot;</p>
