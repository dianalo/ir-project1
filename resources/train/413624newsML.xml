<p>Human bones in a mud-filled van found at the bottom of a canal are probably the remains of five teenagers who vanished nearly 18 years ago, authorities said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The rusted van, covered with algae, was discovered by chance a week ago when a tow truck was pulling another vehicle from the 20-foot- (six-metre-) deep canal.</p>
<p>Beer bottles found in the van and other evidence suggested the youths were victims of a traffic accident, authorities said. Foul play was not suspected.</p>
<p>The five skeletons were not positively identified, Palm Beach County Sheriff's spokesman Paul Miller said.</p>
<p>&quot;Identification is going to take a very long time,&quot; he said. &quot;We have the names of the five individuals who we believe were in the van and whose remains we believe we have.&quot;</p>
<p>The discovery ended nearly two decades of uncertainty for the families of the five, four boys and a girl, who vanished July 14, 1979.</p>
<p>&quot;In my heart I knew he couldn't have been alive and not have contacted me,&quot; Peggy Kelly, mother of the owner of the van, 18-year-old Matthew Henrich, told the Miami Herald.</p>
<p>The last time she saw her son he was headed to the beach to meet some friends.</p>
<p>When the van was pulled from the canal, it was filled with muck and no bodies were visible. It was taken to a salvage yard where it was destined for the scrap heap.</p>
<p>When workers opened the van's doors, they spotted a bone. Police found more bones in the van along with Matthew Henrich's wallet, with cash and identification in it.</p>
