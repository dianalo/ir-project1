<title>UK: S&amp;P assigns Komercni counterparty ratings.</title>
<headline>S&amp;P assigns Komercni counterparty ratings.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Tuesday it assigned its BBB minus long-term and A3 short-term counterparty ratings to Komercni banka (KB).  </p>
<p>&quot;The ratings reflect Komercni banka's leading position in the market, where it captures an approximate 25 percent market share in deposits and 26 percent in loans,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>Also, it said Komercni banka is at the forefront of asset management in the country, having 11.0 billion Czech koruna under management at year-end 1995 through its subsidiary IKS.</p>
<p>Komercni banka also is the leader in the capital markets, accounting for 10 percent of total trading on the Prague Stock Exchange in 1996. The bank is majority, 48.7 percent, state owned via the National Property Fund but is due to be privatized in due course.  </p>
<p>Given the bank's size, its importance to the country's financial system, and position in the market, S&amp;P believes state support would be forthcoming if required in the future, although no formal guarantee exists.</p>
<p>With total assets of 423.7 billion Czech koruna (US$15.97 billion) at the end of June 1996, Komercni banka is the largest bank in the Czech Republic as well as in the region.</p>
<p>Although the bank has been burdened with severe asset-quality problems in the past, some progress has been made in addressing this issue, with the level of classified loans falling to 35.4 percent at the end of September 1996, S&amp;P said.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said the outlook is stable.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank is expected to stabilize its operations in the short to medium term and to benefit from the on-going consolidation in the sector,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>This combined with an expected substantial and sustained improvement in the operating performance and financial strength of the bank, should enable the implicit and explicit support of the banking system to be reduced without increasing the risk profile of the bank, the agency said.</p>
