<headline>Coastal, Bayoil to bring Iraqi crude to US-traders.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. oil company Coastal Corp and trading firm Bayoil are expected to bring Iraqi crude to the Atlantic Basin under the second round of humanitarian oil sales, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Loading is scheduled to begin next week and some of the crude already has found buyers in the U.S. Gulf, pending formal contract and U.N. approval, said the traders, who didn't want to be named.</p>
<p>Next week, Coastal is expected to load four million barrels, half Basrah out of Mina al-Bakr and half Kirkuk out of the Turkish port of Ceyhan in the Meditarranean, traders said.</p>
<p>Bayoil is expected to load more than two million barrels of Iraqi Basrah Light on an Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) at the Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr in the Middle East Gulf during August 18-20, traders said.</p>
<p>Coastal is likely to bring much of its crude to its 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery on the Caribbean island of Aruba.</p>
<p>In the December-June round of the U.N. &quot;oil-for-food&quot; program, Bayoil lifted 15,000 bpd of Basrah in the second 90-day period. Coastal lifted 60,000 bpd of Basrah over the full six months.</p>
<p>Traders differ over how much crude they expect Baghdad to sell in the brief time remaining until the first 90-day period runs out on September 5. Estimates from well-placed U.S. traders varied, with one saying Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) said it would keep exports to between 700,000 and 800,000 bpd, while another said it expected exports of between one million to 1.2 million bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraqis will sell what the market will bear,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>At current prices, Iraq would have to export at a rate of around 1.5 to 1.6 million bpd t reach its $1 billion allowance by September 5, or at full export capacity.</p>
<p>Kirkuk crude is likely to account for about two-thirds of Iraqi exports, while Basrah Light would cover the rest.</p>
<p>The second round of the humanitarian oil sales are set to begin imminently after the U.N. approved Baghdad's pricing formula on Friday, pending contract approvals.</p>
<p>British and Japanese companies were told Thursday that they would not be allowed to renew the oil contracts they held during the earlier round, apparently because of their obstruction of Baghdad's aid requests.</p>
<p>But at least some U.S. companies look set to renew, despite the fact that the U.S. was by far the most obstructive of Iraq's proposed aid imports. Oil majors Chevron Corp, Mobil Corp and Texaco Inc all said Friday that they were still in talks with SOMO about renewing their contracts.</p>
