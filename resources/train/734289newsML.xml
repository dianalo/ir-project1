<title>BURMA: Kyat trading halted as Burma dealers detained.</title>
<headline>Kyat trading halted as Burma dealers detained.</headline>
<dateline>RANGOON 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>Trade in the plunging Burmese kyat ground to a halt when the government detained traders over the currency's nosedive against dollar-denominated foreign exchange certificates (FECs), witnesses said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The kyat has plummeted nearly 46 percent so far this month amid rumours of a change in monetary policy and a growing lack of confidence in the currency, analysts said.</p>
<p>Licenced FEC trading counters were not doing business by late morning on Wednesday because authorities in the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had picked up head traders, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the traders in charge of the counters had been detained for questioning by authorities on Monday evening. Some illegal FEC and dollar traders were also picked up, they said.</p>
<p>Government officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The FEC, which was introduced in February 1993 mainly so foreign tourists would not have to buy the currency at its overvalued official rate, can only be legally changed at the counters.</p>
<p>By Monday, the last day official trade took place, the kyat had plunged nearly 30 percent in the last week and almost 46 percent since the beginning of the month. It was trading at around 270 per FEC late on Monday compared to 210-211 on July 9 and 185 in the last week of June.</p>
<p>In the official exchange market, which is rarely used, the kyat was quoted unmoved around six to the dollar.</p>
<p>The sharp plunge in the kyat against the FEC was due to a lack of confidence in the kyat, the government's decision to open FEC-denominated letters of credit and rumours of a possible change in the monetary system, local analysts said.</p>
<p>News of the detentions and halting of trade in the currency came as a top general denied rumours of a change in the monetary system.</p>
<p>&quot;Unscrupulous persons are spreading rumours in Yangon (Rangoon) that the monetary system will be changed after Myanmar (Burma) becomes an ASEAN member,&quot; state-run newspapers quoted SLORC Secretary One, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, as saying.</p>
<p>Burma is due to become a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) later this month.</p>
<p>Khin Nyunt said other false rumours included talk that FECs would be withdrawn from circulation and that foreign exchange deposited in banks would be seized by the government.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumours about financial and economic matters...are utterly untrue and have merely been concocted by destructionists,&quot; he was reported as saying. &quot;Don't believe the rumours spread by the destructionist elements.&quot;</p>
<p>The sharp drop in the currency has caused prices to skyrocket over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Some shopkeepers said they have stopped selling wholesale goods in kyat because of the rapidly changing value.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to change the price tags all the time to adjust with the galloping rate,&quot; one storeowner said. &quot;If they (locals) pay in FECs it is all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Since it became legal to exchange FEC's for kyat, a growing number of ordinary Burmese residents have been buying FECs as they lose faith in the kyat, analyst said.</p>
<p>Diplomats and local economists say inflation is already around 40 percent per year and could rise if the kyat continued to plunge.</p>
