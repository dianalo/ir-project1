<p>Nigeria on Saturday unveiled a 1997 budget shorn of widely expected reforms such as privatisation of state firms. Analysts said the government had lost a chance to attract much-needed investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Privatisation is the only way out of our problems and this government has lost a window of opportunity by not seizing the chance,&quot; said Elo Ewoke of Ewoke management consultants.</p>
<p>Military ruler General Sani Abacha, in a nationwide radio and television broadcast, said government needed more consultations before embarking on privatisation of state companies while the dual exchange rate in place would continue.</p>
<p>The World Bank and local business leaders have been pressing for privatisation, saying it would bring in badly needed funds to stimulate real economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The various options open to government will be closely examined by a high-powered committee before any privatisation exercise is embarked upon,&quot; Abacha said.</p>
<p>It was an anti-climax after widespread expectations that Abacha would announce that privatisation would start in 1997 and inject new life into the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a kind of death knell for privatisation as the government is not likely to do it in 1998, the year the military intends to hand over to a democratically-elected government,&quot; the independent Thisday newspaper said in a front-page comment.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also unlikely that a civilian administration would have the will to take on such a volatile issue as privatisation,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The issue has been at the forefront of discussion in and outside Nigeria since October when finance minister Anthony Ani said Nigeria was seriously considering selling its crude oil production joint ventures and privatising the oil refineries.</p>
<p>Oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been in recession since 1993 when the country slid into crisis over annulment of an election that would have restored democracy.</p>
<p>Its relations with the West have deteriorated over alleged human rights violations, including the detention since 1994 of Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the annulled poll and the nation's slow pace of democratisation.</p>
<p>Abacha did not say anything new on the protracted political crisis but said his programme to hand over power to a democratically-elected president next year was going well.</p>
<p>In his broadcast Abacha concentrated on the economy, saying free market policies in place since early 1995 have stabilised the exchange rate and other critical sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;Most economic fundamentals moved in the desired direction...accordingly, the 1997 budget is a budget of economic growth and development,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In October, Ani argued at a seminar in Lagos that ...&quot;privatisation will open our economy up for the foreign investment we very much need.&quot;</p>
<p>But official sources said he had failed to convince the ruling military council at a crucial budget meeting this week that it was desirable to embark on privatisation straight away.</p>
<p>At stake is a huge oil industry in which Nigeria's foreign joint venture partners have said they are willing to increase their stake if the government will divest from it.</p>
<p>&quot;We are disappointed that the government is procrastinating,&quot; said one senior oil industry executive. &quot;If Abacha can't do it no other Nigerian ruler can do it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Abacha, an infantry general who seized power in the 1993 chaos that followed the election annulment has won praise for rescuing an economy that was on the brink.</p>
<p>&quot;Privatisation would have been his crowning glory but it appears for Nigeria it is a matter of national pride to hold onto the economy,&quot; said one Western diplomat.</p>
