<headline>Air Littoral airline plans third French hub.</headline>
<dateline>VENICE, Italy 1997-07-04</dateline>

<p>French regional airline Air Littoral plans a third hub at either Toulouse or Bordeaux to serve the Spanish market, the airline's manager for Italy's Veneto-Trentino-Friuli region, Eric Ingargiola, told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>However, this was not planned before 1998, he said.</p>
<p>Air Littoral, majority-owned by French businessman Michel Seydoux, already operates out of Montpelier and Nice, covering France and Italy respectively.</p>
<p>The airline has a marketing and ticket code-sharing agreement with Lufthansa and as part of the cooperation pact Air Littoral plans to issue eight-year convertible bonds to Lufthansa which will allow the German company to buy up to 15 percent of the French firm's capital.</p>
<p>It also operates 29 national and international routes for Air France.</p>
<p>Air Littoral has a fleet of 30 planes, including 15 ATR 42-500s, and is spending $133 million for seven new Canadair regional jets to be delivered by end-1997 with an option for a further five.</p>
<p>The company, with total capital of 63.8 million French francs and 100 percent owned by Cie Francaise d'Investissement Aeronautique, part of the Seydoux group, aims for a Paris bourse listing by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The airline carried 1.8 million passengers in the 1996/97 financial year ending on March 31, some 100,000 up on the previous year.</p>
<p>Ingargiola said the load factor on its Nice-Venice route averaged 63 percent, well above that on its other six Italian routes, from Nice to Milan, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples and Olbia.</p>
