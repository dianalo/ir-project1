<headline>Italy govt makes offer in metalworkers' dispute.</headline>

<p>The Italian government, after all-night talks with trade unions and employers, presented a proposal on Monday to end a protracted pay dispute in the engineering and metalworkers' sector.</p>
<p>The talks were suspended while unions and employers studied the proposal, said the statement issued by the office of Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;After several different meetings which took place overnight, the government, taking note of the significant progress that was made, presented a proposal to end the negotiations,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Union leaders had hoped for a deal by Sunday in the months-long dispute but said earlier in the day that employers had raised fresh obstacles and called on the government to decide how to carry negotiations forward.</p>
<p>Talks between sectoral unions FIM, FIOM and UILM and the employers' body Federmeccanica resumed last Monday for the first time in more than a month to try to end the dispute.</p>
<p>It involves some 1.7 million workers in a sector which accounts for 40 percent of industrial output.</p>
<p>Any deal is likely to set the tone for other pay accords and prove key to Italy's hopes of containing inflation.  </p>
<p>Prodi's office said the government had proposed a 30-month national contract period to replace a two-year contract which expired last June.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the employers would make a one-time payment of 512,000 lire ($316) during the first six months, followed by graduated monthly wage increases totalling 200,000 lire ($124) during the rest of the contract, the statement said.</p>
<p>Union leaders said they expected to give their response to the proposal sometime later on Monday or Tuesday, and that a new meeting between the unions and Federmecanicca would likely take place on Tuesday at the Labour Ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has forwarded a comprehensive proposal which we are evaluating,&quot; said Sergio Cofferatti, leader of an umbrella trade group CGIL.</p>
