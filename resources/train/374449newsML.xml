<p>Canadian spot natural gas prices continued to erode Thursday, ladened by rising temperatures and plentiful gas storage supplies, sources said.</p>
<p>At the AECO storage hub, swing prices fell another 15 cents to the C$1.60-1.62 per gigajoule (GJ) range, as temperatures in Calgary were expected to climb to about four degrees Celsius by the weekend.</p>
<p>Pressured by the weakening daily market, March AECO prices drifted lower to about C$1.60 per GJ early Thursday but recovered to about C$1.64 in late trading.</p>
<p>April/October AECO was talked around C$1.39 early and about C$1.42 late.</p>
<p>At Sumas, Wash., prices dropped into the $1.65-1.70 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) range, down more than 20 cents from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Northwest Pipeline reported earlier that land movement was the main factor contributing to this weekend's ruptures on the two sections of its 26-inch gas pipeline in western Washington.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, Northwest said it has stopped the flow of natural gas in the 26-inch mainline from Sumas to Washougal, Wash., thus taking the pipeline out of service for approximately 260 miles.</p>
<p>The parallel 30-inch pipeline will remain in service, the company said.</p>
<p>At Niagara, where temperatures are also forecast to turn milder, prices fell another 15 cents to the high-$2.40s to low-$2.50s per mmBtu.</p>
<p>Ample storage supply is another factor contributing to the softening eastern Canadian market, sources said.</p>
