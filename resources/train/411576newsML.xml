<title>USA: Funds outflow pressures Latin Brady debt.</title>
<headline>Funds outflow pressures Latin Brady debt.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>For the first time since the beginning of the year, dedicated emerging market funds are lightening up their holdings of Latin American debt amid jitters over U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw outright selling by dedicated funds,&quot; said a trader with a major U.S. investment house.</p>
<p>The exodus, claimed the trader, was prompted by Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's warning on Wednesday about surging asset prices.</p>
<p>Although the selling began on Wednesday when Greenspan's testimony was delivered, the mood turned much more somber in the followthrough, he said.  </p>
<p>Spreads of major Latin Bradies over U.S. Treasuries widened some 20 to 40 basis points, with Venezuela underperforming the general market, the trader said.</p>
<p>Marcelo Fleury, head of the Brazil Desk at Garban Corp, also heard that some of the net selling came from &quot;institutional players.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trading is very, very heavy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The reversal was remarkable, given the fact that the spreads were still tightening on Wednesday morning before Greenspan spoke, Fleury said.  </p>
<p>President Bill Clinton must decide by Saturday whether to decertify Mexico and Colombia, along with other nations as failing to cooperate enough in the war on drugs. Decertfication raises the specter of economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Russia and East European debts were also weaker. Traders showed nary a concern about speculation roiling Russian financial markets that Russian prime ministier Viktor Chernomyrdin might be replaced.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect some cabinet reshuffling, but not at the very top level,&quot; said a U.S. bank trader.  </p>
<p>&quot;This was all Treasuries-related,&quot; he said. &quot;All the fundamental news from Latin America was positive.&quot;</p>
<p>Kip Allardt, Latin America fixed income analyst t at CS First Boston, said there was a heightened awareness that the Fed could raise interest rates preemptively.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a fundamental shift from the way people are thinking,&quot;  he said.</p>
<p>But there was not enough evidence yet to call the current selloff a key reversal, Allardt said.  </p>
<p>The near-term bottom, however, was not clear, said a  trader, noting that the selling of these two days &quot;did a lot of technical damage.&quot;</p>
<p>If the U.S. interest rates spike higher, Argentina and Brazil, whose financing needs rank the highest among Latin countries, would be the hardest hit, Allardt said.</p>
<p>Argentina FRBs  ARFLC05=RR fell 1-1/8 to 90-3/8 bid, and Brazil C  BR8D14=RR shed 1-1/2 to 79-3/4 bid.</p>
<p>The weakness in the Mexican peso was much less worrisome, as the currency had been too strong for the good of the Mexcican economy, he said.  </p>
<p>At 1645 EST/2145 GMT, the peso was quoted 7.950/970 in spot trading.</p>
<p>Traders had not been overly worried with the threat of &quot;decertification&quot; for Mexico after the arrest of the country's top anti-drug fighter suspected of corruption.</p>
<p>Mexico is expected to get a waiver on &quot;vital national interest&quot; grounds, they said.</p>
<p>Mexico Pars  MX625L19=RR lost 1-1/2 to 75-3/4 bid.  </p>
<p>Russia dollar Vnesh  RUVNUSLNS=RR lost 1.00 point to 83-7/8.</p>
