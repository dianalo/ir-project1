<p>Two tremors rocked Nepal on Monday as aftershocks from a weekend earthquake rolled through the Kathmandu valley and kept fearful residents outside their homes, authorities said. No casualties were reported.</p>
<p>A quake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale struck Sarsen town, north of Kathmandu, at 4:23 p.m. (1038 GMT), damaging buildings but causing no casualties, they said.</p>
<p>The tremor came some 10 hours after an earlier shock measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale hit the same Rasuwa district.</p>
<p>Dilli Ram Tiwari of the National Seismological Centre in the capital Kathmandu said the tremors appeared to be among more than 110 aftershocks from several earthquakes on Saturday in the same region.</p>
<p>The main tremor on Saturday measured 5.8 on the Richter scale and was felt in Kathmandu.</p>
<p>Earthquakes measuring between four and five on the Richter scale are powerful enough to cause heavy damage in populated areas.</p>
<p>Tiwari said the pattern of aftershocks could be cause for concern as the second main tremor on Monday was stronger than the first, indicating the shock waves were not diminishing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are afraid of going inside our houses and we are prepared to sleep out tonight,&quot; Bishnu Prasad Gautam of Dhunche town told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>More than 700 people were killed when an earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale hit Udayapur in eastern Nepal in 1988.</p>
