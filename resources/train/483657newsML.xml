<p>IndeNet Inc said its board accepted the resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Lautz Jr effective March 31.</p>
<p>Andre Blay, an outside member of the board for the past two years, was appointed chairman and Graeme Jenner, chief operating officer since October 1996, was appointed CEO effective immediately, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;From the outset I have known that the time would come when I would move on,&quot; Lautz said.</p>
<p>&quot;The group of companies I have been able to assemble in the last two years are leaders in their respective market segments, and Andre and Graeme have the industry experience to ensure these companies continue to respond quickly and effectively to the rapidly changing media industry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blay is a media entrepreneur and investor, the company said. He founded Magnetic Video Corp, it said.</p>
