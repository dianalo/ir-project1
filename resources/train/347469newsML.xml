<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bonds ended up sharply as March Confederate bond futures set new highs.</p>
<p>German and U.S. bonds also climbed steeply after U.S. data resassured markets about inflation.</p>
<p>U.S. fourth quarter gross domestic product showed a stronger than expected 4.7 percent rise but the deflator was 1.4 percent versus 1.8 percent forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;We moved in tandem with the Bunds and Treasuries,&quot; one Swiss dealer said, adding that it appeared market markers were unwilling to short Swiss bonds at current levels. Customer sentiment was also seen as bullish.  </p>
<p>Demand in the cash market favoured maturities from 2006 to 2008.</p>
<p>The March futures contract hit a high for the day of 118.00, taking out its most recent high of 117.89 set on January 23.</p>
<p>Shorter maturities were also firmer, with the Swiss National Bank adding liquidity to the money market this morning in what traders judged to be a relatively generous operation designed to keep call money in its current rate below 2.00 percent, and above 1.50 percent.</p>
<p>-- Friday's closing prices as follows:  </p>
<p>March Conf futures up 40 at 117.90.</p>
<p>March Comi medium-term bond down two at 111.18</p>
<p>Mar Euro Swiss francs up three at 98.26.</p>
<p>4-1/2 Jun 2007 bond 105.75/85 yield 3.80 pct</p>
<p>(Thursday 105.10/20 yield 3.879 pct)</p>
<p>-- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340</p>
