<text>
<p>IPE natural gas futures continued weaker on Monday afternoon as the first two months both ticked down in thin trade.</p>
<p>A single deal of 25 lots was done in front-month July at 9.25 pence a therm, off by 0.25 pence from the settlement level on Friday.</p>
<p>And a five-lot deal in August was done shortly before the session closed at 9.25 pence, followed seconds later by a 25-lot deal at 9.275 pence. August, like July, had previously settled at 9.50 pence a therm.</p>
<p>The trend was weaker further forward, with offers for all months as far as December, as well as for March next year, pitched below the previous settlement price.</p>
<p>A futures broker said there were no fundamental influences driving prices and added that futures levels were following the physical market.</p>
