<headline>Reliance Bancorp to buy Continental Bank.</headline>
<dateline>GARDEN CITY, N.Y. 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Reliance Bancorp Inc said Monday it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Continental Bank, a commercial bank based in Garden City, New York, for about $24.2 million.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Reliance said it will issue 1.10 shares of its common stock for each outstanding common share of Continental. Based upon the closing price of Reliance's common stock as of May 2, 1997, Continental's shareholders will receive common stock valued at $26.40.  </p>
<p>Reliance estimates that operational efficiencies generated from the deal will produce cost savings equal to 35 percent of Continental's non-interest expense. Exact estimates were not provided.</p>
<p>In connection with the transaction, there is a provision for a termination fee payable to Reliance if the transaction is not completed under certain circumstances. Continental has granted Reliance an option to purchase shares equal to 19.9 percent of Continental's outstanding common stock under certain conditions, Reliance said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that the addition of the Continental loan portfolio and deposit base together with the operational efficiencies generated from this transaction will increase Reliance's earnings and generate growing value for Reliance stockholders,&quot; Reliance said.</p>
<p>The deal will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and will not affect Reliance's ability to repurchase shares under its current and future stock repurchase programs, the comapany said.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 1997, and is subject to the approval of the stockholders of Continental Bank and regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>Based on March 31, 1997 financial information, the combined company would have total assets of $2.1 billion, deposits of $1.5 billion, 30 banking offices located in the counties of Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk and 5 Money Center check cashing facilities and a commercial lending facility in Manhattan.</p>
