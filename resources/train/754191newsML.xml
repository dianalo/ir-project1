<title>UK: UK export orders slump, domestic demand up-CBI.</title>
<headline>UK export orders slump, domestic demand up-CBI.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-24</dateline>

<p>British manufacturers' export orders in the four months to July fell at the fastest rate since October 1991, the middle of the last recession, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Its quarterly trends survey showed domestic demand rose at the fastest rate since April 1995, although overall growth of orders slowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next four months overall demand is expected to grow more strongly due to rising domestic orders, while exports are expected to continue falling,&quot; the CBI said.</p>
<p>Some 39 percent of manufacturers said their export orders had fallen while 19 percent reported an increase, giving a negative balance of 20 percent compared with a negative balance of seven percent in the four months to April and one percent in the four months to January.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' optimism about exports for the year ahead has fallen at the fastest rate since October 1980 to reach a negative balance of 28 percent.</p>
<p>Over the next four months, prices are expected to be more of a constraint on export orders than at any time since July 1981, reflecting the strengthening of sterling since April's survey.</p>
<p>But the survey found firms expect domestic orders to grow more strongly over the coming four months, although the CBI pointed out demand expectations have not been fully realised in any of the last nine quarterly surveys.</p>
<p>Growth in manufacturing output eased slightly and the positive balance of seven percent of manufacturers reporting higher output was the lowest since July 1996.</p>
<p>Firms now expect output to grow more rapidly, but over the past two years expectations have proved overly optimistic, the CBI said. It added that business confidence as fallen for the first time since April last year.</p>
<p>Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's Economic Affairs Committee, said the survey results showed a sharp dichotomy in the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic demand is continuing to grow, while export orders and confidence in the longer-term prospects are being hit by the strength of sterling,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;More positively the growth in output is likely to continue, underpinned by domestic orders. Encouragingly this is also helping to boost manufacturers' investment plans.&quot;</p>
<p>Domestic prices fell slightly, reflecting strong competitive pressures, and over the next four months manufacturers expect domestic prices to fall further.</p>
<p>Export prices, which fell by their fastest rate since January 1973, are expected to continue to fall rapidly.</p>
<p>Plans for investing in plant and machinery over the next year are at their strongest since January 1989 and the number of firms intending to invest in buildings is at the highest level since April 1988.</p>
