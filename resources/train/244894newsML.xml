<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended firm on Monday after the Dow's unexpected recovery on Friday, but dealers said the market had not broken out of its downtrend.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still in a sideways to down pattern. If December closes above 20,965, then we can relax because it should go higher,&quot; said a trader with a local futures house.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 December contract ended 380 points higher at 20,595. March finished at 20,640, up 390 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said rollover activity had picked up momentum and the market was likely to shift its focus to the March contract ahead of December's expiry on December 12.  </p>
<p>The trader said the contract's close above the psychologically important 20,550 level was a positive sign, but it would face intra-day resistance around 20,760 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan that the Fed needed to be wary of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in U.S. stock and other asset markets sent world financial markets tumbling on Friday.</p>
<p>The Dow ended 55.16 points lower at 6,381.95 on Friday after dropping as much as 135 points during the session.</p>
