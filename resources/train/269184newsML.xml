<title>UK: IPE oil futures languish near session lows.</title>
<headline>IPE oil futures languish near session lows.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude futures wallowed near session lows on Friday afternoon, unmoved by a quiet opening on NYMEX, brokers said.</p>
<p>Feb Brent was 24 cents lower at $23.74 a barrel by 1532 GMT, while Jan gas oil was $2.00 off at $215.75 a tonne.</p>
<p>In the absence of a rally on U.S. heating oil, London markets were expected to remain subdued by pre-holiday book-squaring, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bearing in mind this is the last full week of the year, we may have some long liquidation going on,&quot; said brokers Prudential Bache in a daily report.  </p>
<p>The prompt Jan/Feb gas oil intermonth spread came under pressure, losing $1.75 to stand at +$1.75 amid weak demand on physical markets in northwest Europe.</p>
<p>Slack European markets and stronger demand in the United States have allowed Russian gas oil cargoes to start moving across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Around 180,000 tonnes of Russian heating oil is due to arrive in the U.S. before the end of December, traders said.</p>
<p>Activity in Europe was sluggish, but traders continued to focus their attention on the weather on both sides of the Atlantic.  </p>
<p>Independent U.S. forecaster Weather Services Corp said a cold front would push across the eastern part of the United States towards the middle of the week, bringing cold weather in its wake.</p>
<p>High waves and winds have also closed Mexico's three main crude ports for two days this week.</p>
