<p>A Moroccan court has sentenced a Spanish national to three months in jail after convicting him of attempting to ship would-be Moroccan immigrants to Spain.</p>
<p>The Moroccan news agency MAP said on Wednesday the criminal court in the northern coastal town of Tangier on Monday also sentenced two Moroccans, arrested with the Spaniard, each to one month suspended jail term.</p>
<p>The two were also fined 500 dirhams ($54) for their failed illegal immigration attempt, MAP added.</p>
<p>The court convicted Manuel Barrera Luque of trying to ferry clandestine immigrants aboard his boat, Paola, to Spain in return for 10,000 dirhams ($1,087) from each would-be illegal immigrant, MAP said.</p>
<p>His boat was forced to put into Tangier after it ran out of fuel.</p>
<p>Tangier is a springboard for many would-be immigrants to Spain, mostly unemployed Moroccan youths, seeking a better future there and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>An estimated 4,000 illegal immigrants went to Spain from Morocco in 1996, according to Spanish police and Moroccan press reports.</p>
<p>($1 = 9.2 dirhams)</p>
