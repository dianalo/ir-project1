<headline>FOCUS-European bourses climb on back of Wall St.</headline>

<p>European bourses rallied strongly in late trade on Tuesday after Wall Street defied predictions of a weak start and resumed its own heady progress.</p>
<p>The region's three biggest stock markets, London, Paris and Frankfurt, all rose despite lingering worries about the resilience of U.S. markets. Madrid closed at a record.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly weak U.S. housing starts data for October helped Wall Street ignore predictions of more weakness after it closed a point down on Monday following eight record sessions.</p>
<p>By the time European stock markets closed, New York's Dow Industrials Average was showing a rise of 34 points.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange markets saw the dollar close to its session lows against the mark and yen, with the spotlight fixed on the buoyant British pound.</p>
<p>Sterling powered to a four-year high of 1.6769 dollars and by 1630 GMT it was trading just under its highs.</p>
<p>The market focus was on the U.S. September trade figures and Germany's Ifo business climate survey due on Wednesday and German M3 monetary data later in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. asset markets got a lift on the housing data but the dollar has not really reacted,&quot; said a U.S. bank dealer. &quot;It's going to need a bit more to break it out of these ranges.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany's blue-chip DAX index closed fractionally higher as Deutsche Telekom joined the 30-share index the day after its scorching global debut with a weighting of 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>The overall market rose strongly in post-bourse screen trading, the IBIS DAX putting on nearly 13 points to 2,781.73.</p>
<p>Europe's biggest phone company Deutsche Telekom lost ground after Monday's debut, however. It closed floor trade in Frankfurt at 32.07 marks, five percent down from its opening level of 32.20.</p>
<p>The volume of Telekom shares traded was bigger than a normal day's trading in all the DAX 30 shares combined, with over 11 million changing hands in bourse dealings and more than 20 million in computer trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Big and small investors are cashing in,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>London traders said British stocks followed Wall Street higher although worries remained over the U.S. rally and next week's British budget presentation. The FTSE 100 index closed up 16 points at 3,978.1</p>
<p>&quot;For once we've taken some notice of Wall Street and there have been some good results out. The 'phone companies and pharmaceuticals have turned in very good performances today,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The market was enlivened in the afternoon by Vodafone, which gained 11p to 254-1/2p after it released first half results towards the top end of expectations and said it was buying retailer Peoples Phone Plc.</p>
<p>Among pharmaceuticals and chemicals stocks, Zeneca gained 42p to 1,698p on what one dealer called heavy interest from the U.S., while BOC Group rose 43-1/2p to 879-1/2p after releasing pretax profits for the year above expectations.</p>
<p>French shares rose before the close along with Wall St, recapturing Monday's losses and leaving the market slightly bullish.</p>
<p>&quot;We recovered all of yesterday's loss,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Not a bad day, actually.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 11.24 points or 0.5 percent at 2,240.05. The CAC-40 futures contract was up nine points at 2,244.0. Volume was 4.9 billion francs.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel closed down 1.28 percent at 7.70 francs but off its lows after a fire in the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain forced the temporary closure of the rail link.</p>
<p>Euro Disney recovered to 11.40 francs from a low of 10.80 after the Paris theme park operator reported a 77 percent rise in 1995-96 profits but said it still faced a tough year.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1630 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 111.55 yen and 1.5035 marks, compared with 111.29 yen and 1.4996 marks in late European trade on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS - CLOSING INDICES</p>
<p>LONDON - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares closed up 16 points, or 0.4 percent, at 3,978.1.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index ended up 11.24 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,240.05.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed up 0.25 points at 2,764.09. In later screen-based trading the IBIS DAX ended up 13.11 points at 2,782.01.</p>
