<p>The president of the German labour office, Bernhard Jagoda, presented a series of action points which should be followed to allow Germany to create 2.5 million new jobs by the year 2005.</p>
<p>Jagoda told journalists that he saw four conditions that must be met, which would allow two million jobs to be created by the year 2000 and a further 500,000 by 2005.</p>
<p>Germany has set itself a goal of reducing unemployment by half by the year 2000. The jobless number stood at about 4.1 million on both an adjusted and unadjusted basis in December.</p>
<p>Most independent economists, and some key industry officials, have said the goal is totally unrealistic.</p>
<p>Jagoda proposed that current wages for those in work should only rise at the inflation rate over the next few years, while a proportion of overtime should be converted into new jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot convert all overtime into new posts -- a healthy economy needs some overtime working -- but about 40 percent of overtime hours should be transferred to new jobs,&quot; he said on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The third condition for a wave of job creation would be a reduction in allied costs borne by companies for workers, which he said should be reduced by one percentage point in two separate stages, adding that this would lower one barrier to taking on new staff.</p>
<p>Fourthly, he called on the government to invest more once deficits had been brought down this year to allow Germany to qualify for the single European currency.</p>
<p>But he added that he did not want to create the impression that fiscal discipline should come to a halt once countries had met the conditions for entry to EMU laid down in the Maastricht Treaty in the key 1997 year.</p>
<p>&quot;I do realise that Maastricht is not just 1997. That is only the start,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jagoda said that it was possible that German unemployment could rise to 4.5 million in the first months of 1997, but said there was no reason to believe that the German government's forecast for an average level of 3.952 million in 1997 was in need of revision.</p>
<p>Independent economists have predicted that joblessness will increase to about 4.1 million this year.</p>
