<headline>Dlr propped in Europe as jobs expectations clash.</headline>

<p>The dollar was buoyed against the mark in early Europe as players awaited key jobs data expected to show a glaring contrast between the U.S. and Germany.</p>
<p>The German Labour office on Thursday confirmed newspaper leaks of an unadjusted 90,000 drop in May jobless, which reports said translated into a seasonally-adjusted rise of 60,000.</p>
<p>That would compare unfavourably with the expected 219,000 increase in May U.S. non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/mark should be supported by the divergent jobs data from Germany and the U.S.,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London.  </p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.7322/27 marks at 0728 GMT, slightly up from late Thursday's European level of 1.7292/97.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen stood at 115.71/81 versus 115.63/68, its upside capped by a report that Japan's trade surplus would be discussed at the June 20-22 Group of Seven summit in Denver, traders said.</p>
<p>Friday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun, quoting sources close to summit participants, said the G7 would call on Japan to prevent its surplus from growing.</p>
<p>Data out yesterday showed Japan posted a surplus of 41.16 billion yen in the first 20 days of May, compared with a 180.94 billion deficit in the same period last year.  </p>
<p>Analysts expected a quiet, range-bound morning as the market awaited U.S. payrolls. Although a strong number is largely priced in, the risk is still for a dollar rally, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Relatively strong payrolls and soft labour market data in Germany point to dollar/mark really sustaining its current levels or even gaining upward momentum,&quot; said Ken Wattret, international economist at Banque Paribas here.</p>
<p>Simmering tensions over European monetary union will also keep the mark under pressure. EU finance ministers meet to discuss EMU in Luxembourg this weekend, and the market fears a fractious encounter, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the budget stability pact was the key issue on the agenda, with a possibility of friction between France and Germany. France's new Socialist-led government has threatened to throw open the German-instigated pact -- designed to enforce budgetary rigour after EMU's launch -- agreed last December.</p>
<p>&quot;Any kind of friction on such a pivotal issue is likely to give rise to further speculation of EMU delay,&quot; said Wattret.</p>
<p>Though talk of delay is usually seen as mark-positive as the market contemplates a reduced risk of the German unit being subsumed into weaker one, Wattret said it adds to the current uncertainty over EMU and is boosting the U.S. as a safe haven.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, sterling drifted nervously as players awaited the outcome of the first meeting of the Bank of England's new monetary policy committee.</p>
<p>Markets were expecting a quarter-point official rate rise to 6.50 percent when the Bank anounced the decision at 1100 GMT.</p>
<p>The Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday that rates should be left unchanged ahead of the new Labour government's first budget on July 2 and because tightening could push the pound yet higher.</p>
<p>Sterling stood at 2.8187/97 marks and $1.6272/78 at 0831 GMT against 2.8210/20 and $1.6331/46 in late Europe on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Back in Germany, the May unemployment figures came in close to expectations, showing a 56,000 seasonally-adjusted rise in joblessness to 4.358 million, for an unadjusted rate of 11.1 percent. The total unadjusted figure was 4.256 million.</p>
<p>Labour Office President Bernhard Jagoda said May economic growth was insufficient to turn the jobs market around.</p>
<p>Jagoda said he could no longer endorse the government's official forecast of 3.95 million average unemployment in 1997. Another Labour Office official said the average total could now rise as high as 4.29 million.</p>
