<p>Brazil shares ended up 1.06 percent on soaring volume as investors settled their options Monday, brokers said.</p>
<p>Market turnover totalled a hefty 4.365 billion reais ($4.079 billion), the second highest volume in the exchange's history in a day of options settlement, according to the Sao Paulo bolsa's statistics.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of the 48 most active stocks closed at 11,954 points, with Telebras and electrical shares leading the rise.  </p>
<p>Traders said all Telebras options at strike prices of up to 150 reais were entirely exercised, while the 150 real options were partially exercised.</p>
<p>Telebras preferred, the underlying stock, closed at 151.60 reais, up 1.0 percent from Friday's close.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market traded lower mid-afternoon, but rebounded late in the session on short-covering.</p>
<p>Electrical shares continued their uptrend as investors kept moving into the power sector to take advantage of the stocks' upside potential.  </p>
<p>to 611 reais. Earlier the company said it plans to issue up to $400 million in dollar-denominated bonds in July's first half.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo state power firm Cesp rose 3.47 percent to 77.20 reais.</p>
<p>Among other blue chips, Petrobras rose 1.99 percent at 308 reais, while private Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) fell 0.79 percent to close at 25 reais.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's power sector index, comprising the nine most liquid shares of the electrical sector, rose 0.07 percent to close at 3,274 points.  </p>
<p>Traders said a 1.39 percent drop in Minas Gerais state higher.</p>
<p>Steel stocks rebounded after Friday's sharp drop caused by concerns over a probe into the sector. CSN shares closed up 2.29 percent at 35.80 reais, while Cosipa surged 7.14 percent to end at 0.60 reais.</p>
<p>Usiminas preferred jumped 6.8 percent to 1.10 reais.  </p>
<p>The bolsa may open higher on Tuesday, but brokers said the day's trajectory would depend on how trade develops post-options expiry.</p>
<p>&quot;It's possible some investors will sell their shares instead of holding them after the settlement,&quot; one trader said.</p>
