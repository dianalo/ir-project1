<headline>CSCE nearby coffee stumbles on Colombian news.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-04</dateline>

<p>CSCE nearby coffee futures ended sharply lower in volatile trading on Wednesday, amid a perception that the upcoming release of Colombian coffee could help alleviate near-term supply tightness, dealers said.</p>
<p>Colombian Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo said late Tuesday the government was opening &quot;unlimited&quot; coffee registrations for July to August, a period in which he said the country was expected to export 2.5 million 60-kg bags of coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;It is bearish because it implies there is more coffee available,&quot; said Refco Inc. analyst Ann Prendergast. &quot;And the market has been running up on tight supply.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark July contract tumbled 12.65 cents per lb, to 251.55 cents, after ranging between 264.50 and 250.00 cents. Second-month September fell 7.95 cents, to 225.10 cents, while the back months closed 6.15 lower to 2.50 higher.</p>
<p>The July/September spread, a barometer of nearby availability, shrank to 26.45 cents from 31.15 cents at the close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Despite today's sell-off on the Colombian news, some analysts said the market may reacted too strongly as stockpiles were still hovering near 20-year lows.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it is as bearish as some people think,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes. &quot;There is too much emphasis on the unlimited exports, but there might not be an unlimited amount of coffee to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>Coffee prices gapped sharply lower at the outset, but the market managed to bounce into positive territory on a round of nervous weather-related buying amid cool weather outlooks this weekend in top-grower Brazil.</p>
<p>Brazilian weather services on Wednesday forecasted a cold weekend for the country's key coffee regions, with temperatures possibly dropping to critical levels.</p>
<p>But Smith Barney meterologist Jon Davis said Wednesday that there is little threat of any frost or freeze damage to Brazil's coffee-growing areas during the next 10 days.</p>
<p>Refco's Prendergast said two key factors seen influencing the market in the next few weeks were Brazil's weather and its crop prospects for the approaching 1997/98 harvest.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Brazil's largest co-operative said the country's coffee crop should reach 24 to 25 million 60-kg bags in 1997/98, down from recent estimates of 27 to 30 million bags in 1996/97.</p>
<p>His estimate was within earlier trade expectations, but well above other Brazilian forecasts of 20 million bags or below.</p>
<p>Another factor seen impacting the market was the drop in total open interest, which has fallen from a recent peak of some 45,000 lots in March to 27,537 lots as of June 3.</p>
<p>Although Prendergast noted some of the drop in open interest was due to an increase in margins, she said that combined with thinner turnover it appeared bearish.</p>
<p>&quot;Falling open interest and falling volume is a warning signal,&quot; said Prendergast. &quot;It indicates a weakening market.&quot;</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 8,448 lots.</p>
