<headline>IPE Brent ends down 30 cts on US heating oil slide.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude futures ended lower in a late wave of profit-taking sparked by heating oil selling in New York.</p>
<p>November Brent ended down 28 cents a barrel at $24.30 after getting within six cents of Tuesday's $24.70 post Gulf War high.</p>
<p>But while Brent lost just over one per cent of its value, NYMEX heating oil finished down more than three per cent.</p>
<p>&quot;Heating lost momentum and Brent came off in sympathy,&quot; said a broker.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the downward correction was hardly surprising given the huge bull run generated by low heating oil stocks which has pulled crude up almost $8 since June.</p>
<p>They said contracts technically were overbought with relative strength indexes looking particularly stretched.</p>
<p>Traders said bulls lost a little confidence with U.S. government and industry statistics showing an unexpected 1.3 million barrel build in distillate stocks last week.</p>
<p>The U.S. shortfall in stocks versus a year ago shrank by 1.6 million barrels to 17.1 million, the American Petroleum Institute said.</p>
<p>Earlier IPE gas oil found some late support from Euroilstock data showing a growing year-on-year shortfall in European Union distillate stocks.</p>
<p>EU distillates stocks, excluding Sweden, at the end of September were 33.47 million barrels less than a year ago, compared to a 25.79 million deficit at end-August.</p>
<p>Distillates fell 2.93 million barrels to 283.35 million barrels during September, Euroilstock said.</p>
<p>October gas oil, which expires at 1100 GMT on Thursday, finished down a $1 a tonne at $244.50.</p>
