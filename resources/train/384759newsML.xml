<p>Centennial Technologies Inc. on Tuesday announced plans to restate its recent earnings as the computer card maker's former CEO remained in federal custody after a detention hearing on charges of insider trading.</p>
<p>Centennial, last year's best performer on the New York Stock Exchange, also said it faces at least 14 lawsuits. And the New York Stock Exchange said it will suspend trading in the stock March 3 and will try to have it delisted.</p>
<p>The lawsuits were filed by purchasers of its securities from Aug. 21, 1996, through Feb. 11, 1997, it said.</p>
<p>Former Centennial Chief Executive Emanuel Pinez, 59, was fired last Tuesday, arrested Friday and has been held without bail since then on charges of insider trading, manipulating his company's inventory and securities fraud.</p>
<p>Centennial said Tuesday it has hired an interim chief executive and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Centennial's stock, which had soared 450 percent during the year to a high of $58.25, plunged $13.50, or 82 percent, to $2.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the biggest percentage loser on the exchange.</p>
<p>The stock had been halted since last Tuesday, when Centennial announced that previous financial statements had included material misstatements.</p>
<p>Centennial said Lawrence Ramaekers of Boca Raton, Fla., has assumed the post of CEO and Eugene M. Bullis of West Newbury, Mass., has become chief financial officer.</p>
<p>In a cramped courtroom Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Cohen heard that Centennial would restate its earnings for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, as well as the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997 and would show the company posting losses in excess of $10 million, more than the amount the computer card maker first reported in profits.</p>
<p>As the litany of fiscal failures continued, Pinez, an Israeli citizen who has homes in Montreal, Switzerland, and Beverly and Burlington, Mass., sat in the spectators' first row shaking his head of gray hair.</p>
<p>Looking tired beneath a tan, Pinez learned he would face at least three years in prison if convicted of the charges, which include insider trading, overstating revenue and manipulating inventory.</p>
<p>FBI agent Robert Turgiss testified at the detention hearing that Pinez owed Lehman Bros. and PaineWebber Group Inc. more than $20 million borrowed &quot;on margin&quot; based on the market value of the stock in his accounts. The stock was primarily shares in Centennial.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Robert Ullmann, attempted to argue that options for Centennial stock -- which Pinez began buying three days before he was fired and from which he would profit if the stock went down -- were not bought at his client's request but because of pressure from the two firms.</p>
<p>But Judge Cohen cut him off, saying, &quot;This is not La-La land. This is not O.J. ... I will assume unless there is evidence to the contrary that the puts and calls (options) were done by Mr. Pinez.&quot;</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a separate case, has charged that Pinez stands to gain $447,500 from the 2,400 &quot;call&quot; option contracts he bought on Centennial stock. The SEC said the value of the 1,955 &quot;put&quot; options, which expire March 21, could not yet be determined.</p>
<p>&quot;If the value of Centennial stock went down, Mr. Pinez would gain, is that correct?&quot; Judge Cohen asked Turgiss.</p>
<p>The attorney replied, &quot;The further Centennial declines, the more Mr. Pinez earns.&quot;</p>
<p>The magistrate did not rule on bail and until he does, Pinez will remain in custody.</p>
