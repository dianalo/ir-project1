<p>American aviator Linda Finch flew into Singapore on Saturday on the latest leg of her bid to emulate the 24,500 mile round-the-world journey on which legendary flyer Amelia Earhart vanished 60 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very proud and happy to be doing this for her,&quot; Finch told reporters after touching down at Seletar Air Base in north eastern Singapore from Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<p>A seasoned pilot who helped restore her 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E -- the same model used by Earhart and one of only two left in the world -- Finch said she hoped the flight would be inspirational.</p>
<p>&quot;We are making the flight not to set records but to communicate what Amelia did with her extraordinary life and what she stood for -- setting goals and achieving them,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Called World Flight 1997, the mission aims to encourage deprived children around the world to aim beyond their perceived limitations.</p>
<p>Aero-engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney has sponsored the flight, paying all US$1.5 million of the plane restoration costs and giving US$3.0 million to a U.S.-based education programme.</p>
<p>Finch set out on March 17 from the same hangar in Oakland, California, from which Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan departed on their fateful attempt.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to leave for Indonesia on Tuesday and head for Australia before embarking on the New Guinea to Howland Island leg on which Earhart's plane disappeared on July 2, 1937.</p>
<p>Finch aims to complete the journey by returning to the Oakland hangar in mid-May.</p>
