<headline>NY precious metals end lower, but volumes light.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended lower Friday, on light volumes, with gold market activity dampened this week by the May Day holiday in Europe Thursday and the U.K. bank holiday Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Some support seems to be coming into the gold market around current levels, but producer hedging may cap the market above $345.00 an ounce, as Australian gold miners have been active recently given the slide in the Australian dollar gold price,&quot; San Francisco-based Mitsui USA bullion dealer, Greg Drury, said.  </p>
<p>The gold price in Australian dollars slid to $432.00 an ounce this week, its lowest level for over 10 years.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold ended Friday off 10 cents at $341.60, after seeing a $342.0-340.90 range. Estimated total COMEX gold volume was just 10,000 lots.</p>
<p>In the bullion market spot gold ended quoted $339.95/45, compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $339.65 and the New York close Thursday around $340.15/65.</p>
<p>Gold prices received little support Friday from U.S. jobs data for April, even though U.S. bond yields moved lower on the news. Gold prices have tended to be inversely correlated with real interest rates recently. The U.S. April unemployment rate fell to 4.9 pct, a 23 year low.</p>
<p>&quot;The gold market may be waiting to see if (Fed chairman) Greenspan hikes rates again on May 20, as if he does, the stockmarket may come off again and encourage some investors into gold,&quot; Drury said.</p>
<p>Technically COMEX June gold still looked weak, though the strength of the downtrend in the past week was waning, as the contract has found support just above $340 every day this week, analysts said.</p>
<p>The economic fundamentals were also mixed, with rumored European central bank activity and producer hedging weighing on the market, but physical offtake remained robust in both the developed and less developed economies, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold prices seem to have stabilized for the time being in a narrow $340-345 trading range basis spot,&quot; Merrill Lynch analyst Ted Arnold said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;The option dealers are busy selling volatility to anyone who will buy it and that could mean we are on the threshold of a new and boring range-bound market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Annualized 20-day historical volatility has drifted back to around 7.20 percent this week, from a high of 15.6 percent in early March.</p>
<p>The spot gold/silver ratio ended around 72.3 percent, but was little changed during the week.</p>
<p>COMEX July silver ended down 4.0 cents at $4.728 an ounce Friday, after recovering from a contract low at $4.630 seen on Monday.</p>
<p>But participation continues to wane, with open interest in COMEX silver falling a further 2,212 lots Thursday to 82,963 contracts, its lowest level for a year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear the fundamentals of the (silver) market are still strong, since if prices are pushed down they have the ability to snap back quickly,&quot; CPM Group analyst Ted Kempf said.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum ended down $3.00 at $371.10, while NYMEX June palladium ended off 10 cents at $156.90.</p>
<p>Russia appeared to be still no nearer to signing a decree that would allow Moscow to negotiate with the Japanese over the supply of platinum group metals for 1997, analysts said, though news of a resumption of supplies may lead to a sell off in the PGM complex.</p>
<p>&quot;However, given the enormous amount of fund interest now seen in the PGM market, we doubt if these price reactions will be either very deep or very sustained,&quot; Arnold said.</p>
