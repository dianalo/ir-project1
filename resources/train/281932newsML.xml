<text>
<p>Mexican police on Monday shot dead an armed bank robber who had been holding at least two hostages at gunpoint, ending a five-hour drama, much of it played out on live television.</p>
<p>Minutes before he was shot and killed, the robber, who answered to the name Gerardo and wore a white baseball cap pulled low over his face, came to the door of the bank holding two hostages at gunpoint.</p>
<p>The holdup at a Bancomer branch in eastern Mexico City began earlier on Monday with a brief shootout that injured one police officer and one civilian. After the shootout, about a dozen hostages were released.</p>
<p>Gayne Quiroz, 19, told Reuters that a man armed with a hand grenade led the assault and initially took about 15 hostages. She was released with about a dozen others.</p>
<p>The Mexican government news agency Notimex said one officer was injured in the hand and a civilian was shot in the leg during the brief shootout as police arrived at the start of the robbery.</p>
<p>At least 100 police officers surrounded the bank and closed off nearby streets.</p>
