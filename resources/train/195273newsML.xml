<title>THAILAND: Democrats lose lead to NAP in Thai poll-TV/Radio.</title>
<headline>Democrats lose lead to NAP in Thai poll-TV/Radio.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1996-11-17</dateline>

<p>The New Aspiration Party (NAP) of Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh edged past the Democrat Party which had earlier led in unofficial television and radio projections of the Thai elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>Official Radio Thailand and the Channel 7 television station put the NAP slightly ahead of the Democrat Party of former premier Chuan Leekpai based on vote counts about 4-1/2 hours after polls closed.</p>
<p>Three television stations had given the Democrat Party the edge over the NAP in initial projections about 90 minutes after the polls closed.</p>
<p>Radio Thailand projected the NAP would win 127 seats in the 393-seat parliament against 124 for the the Democrats.</p>
<p>Channel 7 television gave the NAP 125 and the Democrats 124 seats but Channel 9 television said the NAP was set to win 125 seats to the Democrats 126.</p>
<p>The NAP and the Democrats were seen running neck and neck even before polling closed for the Thai election, said by analysts to be the most violent and dirty in two decades.</p>
<p>The election watchdog Pollwatch said seven people had been killed in election-related violence since the campaign began and up to 30 billion baht ($1.2 billion) had been spent by politicians on campaigns and vote-buying.</p>
<p>The leaders of the two front-running parties, one of which is expected by analysts to be the core of a new coalition government, were unavailable for immediate comment.</p>
<p>The NAP's stronghold is in Thailand's northeast, which is the country's poorest region, and the Democrats control most of the south.</p>
<p>The Democrats were projected by most television and radio stations to have made a strong comeback in the capital of Bangkok winning 28 of the 37 seats at stake. After the July 2, 1995 election, they had seven seats in the capital.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, it is apparent neither the NAP nor the Democrats will win an outright majority of seats in parliament and must seek alliances to form a coalition.</p>
<p>The Chart Pattana Party, which is running third in the polls and the incumbent Chart Thai Party of outgoing premier Banharn Silpa-archa, hold the key to the formation of a new administration, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Palang Dharma Party (PDP) of telecommunications tycoon and former deputy prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was projected to have suffered a near total defeat in its Bangkok stronghold, losing 21 of the 23 seats it previously held.</p>
<p>Thaksin promptly announced his resignation as head of the PDP on Sunday.</p>
