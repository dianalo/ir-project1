<p>Afghanistan's purist Islamic Taleban militia captured Taloqan, capital of the northeastern province of Takhar on Wednesday, a Pakistan-based Afghan news service reported. The Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said the militia had seized Taloqan from opposition forces with the help of local commanders and the local population.  </p>
<p>AIP said opposition sources in the Pakistani border town of Peshawar had confirmed the fall of Taloqan, which president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ittehad-i-Islami chief Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf had used as a temporary base since the Taleban drove the Rabbani government from Kabul in September.</p>
<p>AIP said the Taleban had launched a major offensive into Takhar from neighbouring Kunduz province on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>It said the Taleban had killed 20 soldiers loyal to former government military commander Ahmed Shah Masood and captured 285 after intense fighting in which the Taleban lost eight dead.</p>
<p>AIP said two helicopters had taken off from Taloqan for an undisclosed destination on Tuesday, apparently with opposition leaders on board, but it could not identify them.</p>
