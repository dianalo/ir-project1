<p>Pakistani stocks, which have shed 286 points since the release of a tax-packed federal budget on June 13, are likely to be hit further in months ahead by political unrest and a troubled economy, brokers said.</p>
<p>The teetering Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100-share index will remain under pressure in the next quarter and is likely to sink below the 1,400-point support level, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The worse is not yet over, said Manochar Jamal, chief dealer of Taurus Securities. &quot;The opposition parties' anti-government movement and a hard-pressed economy offers little attraction for local and foreign investors.&quot;</p>
<p>The KSE index dropped 3.42 points, or 0.24 percent, on Thursday, the last trading day before the Moslem weekend, hitting a new year-low at 1,418.57 amid a record eight-month low trading volume of 12.77 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;With local institutions hit by an acute liquidity crunch and foreign investors on the sidelines, trading volumes have gradually dwindled and hardly six or seven speculative scrips are generating activity,&quot; Jamal said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the inflow of foreign funds shrunk due to the rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Continued depreciation of the Pakistani rupee also remains a key dampening factor for the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;For average investors, there is no sense in investing in the stock market,&quot; Mumtaz Kazmi of Global Securities said. &quot;With the rupee's continued downslide, the dollar offers a better investment.&quot;</p>
<p>The rupee has fallen 1.48 percent against the dollar since July 1, the start of fiscal 1996/97 (July/June), while it lost 13.2 percent in the previous year.</p>
<p>Brokers say another major factor depressing Pakistani stocks is the 1996/97 budget, in which Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government imposed new taxes of 42.08 billion rupees to cut the deficit to 4.0 percent from more than 5.0 percent in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;New taxes have hit the private sector,&quot; dealer Ather Raouf of Carr Mashriq said. &quot;Those who pay taxes have been burdened with more taxes bearing a negative impact on market sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;The index has continued to slip since the budget was announced while the government todate is unable to finalise its figures owing to concessions given to various interest groups.&quot;</p>
<p>A delay by the International Monetary Fund in disbursing its third tranche from a $600 million standby loan to Pakistan has also shaken investor confidence. Payments were due in June.</p>
<p>The IMF has indicated it will not review Pakistan's economic policies until Bhutto's government finalises its budget figures.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will remain in a wait-and-see mood until the fate of the IMF's standby loan is decided,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;A clean chit of approval to the government's financial policies by the IMF can prove a shot in the arm for the ailing Pakistani economy and revive investors' confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Market analysts say investment choices among Pakistani stocks would also remain limited in the short to medium term.</p>
<p>Sectors which looked attractive in 1994, when the index peaked at a dizzying 2,600 points, are not exciting any more, said Farooq Lakhani of International Asset Management Co.</p>
<p>Financials, for example, had exhausted their growth potential, he said.</p>
<p>Only select fuel and energy stocks and fertiliser, communications and pharmaceutical companies will generate limited interest and a turnaround in index in early 1997 will be more on technicals rather than fundamentals, dealers said.</p>
