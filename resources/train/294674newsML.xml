<p>Austria's feuding government coalition appeared deadlocked on Wednesday in a row over how to privatise the country's second biggest bank, exposing deep divisions between the chancellor and his foreign minister.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and the the conservative People's Party led by Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel laid out differing views of the sale of Creditanstalt- Bankverein at separate party congresses.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, opening the Social Democrat meeting in the southern spa town of Bad Tatzmannsdorf, made clear that his party would not be pushed around over the privatisation.</p>
<p>He said the choice of one of the three bidders for the bank was the sole responsibility of Finance Minister Viktor Klima, who is a Social Democrat.</p>
<p>&quot;I stress again, it is Klima's decision...We are not going to be bullied into a decision,&quot; the chancellor said.</p>
<p>A final deadline set by Klima for improved offers for the flagship bank expires on Friday. But the conservatives have cautioned him against making a decision until a special parliamentary session next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Vranitzky's stand bodes ill for relations with his junior coalition partner. Senior members of both parties have warned that the survival of the one-year-old government could be jeopardised unless a compromise is reached.</p>
<p>Since democracy returned to Austria at the end of World War Two, control of key institutions has largely been shared out between the two parties -- there are even two motoring organisations, one backed by each party.</p>
<p>But with the advent of real foreign competition in particular following membership of the European Union two years ago, the system of patronage is beginning to crumble, and with it, the consensus politics that glued the two parties together.</p>
<p>Comments over the fragility of the partnership between Social Democrats and Conservatives, who have ruled together for the past 10 years, prompted Vranitzky to rule out fresh elections this year in a New Year address.</p>
<p>In his January 1 speech, President Thomas Klestil expressed exasperation over ructions in the coalition over the bank sale.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no time for this political power game which is endangering cooperation within the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The sale of Creditanstalt, Europe's longest privatisation as it enters its seventh year, has laid bare a battle by each leading party to protect its own power base.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt, one-time bankers to the former imperial Habsburg dynasty, has long been considered the preserve of the People's Party. The real trouble in the coalition began when Bank Austria, considered to be effectively controlled by the Social Democrats, made public its bid to take over Creditanstalt just before a first deadline on December 16.</p>
<p>The People's Party, who favour a bid by an international consortium led by Italian-controlled insurer EA-Generali, considered the move as a bid by the centre-left to consolidate its hegemony over Austria's bloated banking industry.</p>
<p>Schuessel, addressing his party conference in Goldegg, near Salzburg, put down three options for the Creditanstalt sale. One idea was to agree to the sale of half of the government's 70 percent stake in the bank to Bank Austria if the other half was sold on the Vienna bourse.</p>
<p>But that too appeared to find no favour with Vranitzky, signalling a precarious few days ahead for the coalition: &quot;It's a bad option,&quot; he said.</p>
