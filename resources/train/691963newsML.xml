<title>RUSSIA: Tajik government, opposition sign peace deal.</title>
<headline>Tajik government, opposition sign peace deal.</headline>

<p>Tajikistan's embattled President Imomali Rakhmonov and Islamic opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri signed an historic peace accord on Friday to end four years of civil war which killed tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>The signing took place in the presence of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other foreign officials.</p>
<p>It was Yeltsin's first public appearance since attending the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Denver last weekend where he triggered fresh concern about his health by missing a late-night gala concert.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old Kremlin leader underwent heart surgery in November and had pneumonia in January.</p>
<p>&quot;This day should go down as a remarkable page in the history of Tajikistan. It brings to an end one of the longest and bitterest conflicts and peace is descending on the long-suffering land of Tajikistan,&quot; the Kremlin press service quoted Yeltsin as saying.</p>
<p>A seven-month-old ceasefire has largely held but the sweeping accord -- brokered by Iran, Russia and the United Nations -- has taken months of tough negotiations.</p>
<p>The deal was endangered by last-minute wrangling over a stalled prisoner exchange and political power-sharing. But Tajik officials and diplomats say the accord is the first real chance of peace in the mountainous former Soviet republic bordering Afghanistan and China.</p>
<p>The accord envisages the creation of a 26-member National Commission for Reconciliation, to be chaired by Nuri, with places to be divided equally between each side.</p>
<p>Rakhmonov, who survived an assassination attempt in April, remains president but 30 percent of government posts must be given over to the opposition.</p>
<p>Elections for a new parliament must take place before the end of 1998. Opposition guerrillas must integrate with government forces or lay down their weapons.</p>
<p>But many problems cloud the guarded optimism surrounding the deal.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Dushanbe are apprehensive about the return of 460 armed opposition guerrillas to the city and fear their presence could spark more fighting.</p>
<p>Each camp contains hardliners who have little trust for their opponents, while the power-sharing arrangement has sidelined a bewildering array of armed groups and local chieftains in the country of 5.7 million people.</p>
<p>With the economy in tatters, the government and the opposition face the immediate problem of how to deal with armed criminal bands which operate with virtual impunity throughout the country.</p>
