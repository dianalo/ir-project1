<headline>Couple, 15, indicted in New York stabbing death.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-20</dateline>

<p>Two New York teenagers were indicted Friday in the fatal stabbing of a real estate agent in Central Park last month.</p>
<p>Daphne Abdela, daughter of an affluent Manhattan couple, sobbed openly during her brief appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court. Her boyfriend, Christopher Vasquez, showed no emotion.</p>
<p>The two, both 15, were indicted on second-degree murder and robbery charges stemming from the death of Michael McMorrow, 44, whose body was found floating in a Central Park lake.</p>
<p>They are accused of stabbing him about 30 times in the neck, face and chest May 23. Police said they had been drinking with McMorrow in the park on the night of the murder.</p>
<p>Abdela's father, Angelo, is a senior executive at CPC International, a large food service company whose brands include Hellman's Mayonnaise and Skippy Peanut Butter. Her mother, Catherine, is a former French model.</p>
<p>In court the girl did not look at her parents.</p>
<p>Her attorney, Ben Brafman, said: &quot;We intend to persist in our representation to the district attorney that Daphne Abdela had nothing to do with the murder of Michael McMorrow. We are confident that ultimately they will recognise that fact and she will be exonerated of these charges.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyer for Vasquez had no comment.</p>
<p>The teens are scheduled to be arraigned July 16. Prosecutors said they would be tried as adults but, if convicted, sentenced as juveniles. They face a maximum of nine years to life in prison if convicted.</p>
