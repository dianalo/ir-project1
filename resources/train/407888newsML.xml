<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch money rates seen stable after rate hike.</title>
<headline>Dutch money rates seen stable after rate hike.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch money market dealers said the rate hike of the special advances rate by 20 basis points to 2.70 percent would not have much effect on rates in the market as a rise had been priced in already.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the rise appeared somewhat overdone and looked like an overreaction to recent money market conditions where rates had been edging up for two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;They might cut the rate again by 10 basis points in about two weeks,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The bond market barely reacted to the move with guilder-bonds hovering near previous levels.</p>
<p>The guilder was virtually unchanged against the mark at 112.42 per 100 marks versus 112.415 earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;The guilder might gain a little on the move,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>The guilder has been weaker than usual against the German mark for about two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise will give some peace to the market,&quot; said one dealer as there had been a lot of speculation about a possible rise of the advances rate.</p>
<p>The dealer added that the move should also be seen in the light of the EU's move towards Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;The guilder has to be brought closer towards parity with the German mark and the Dutch special advances has to move closer to the German repo,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Dutch special advances is roughly equivalent to Germany's repo rate, which has been pegged at 3.00 percent Since last August.</p>
<p>One-month deposits slipped two basis points to 3.04 percent bid after the rate hike and the rate for call money remained 2.75 percent bid. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
