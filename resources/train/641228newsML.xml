<p>SUGAR - World market for June 4, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed lower in quiet dealings. August lost $1.80 to close at $329.00 per tonne. October closed at $319.80 per tonne, a loss of $1.90. Raw sugar futures in New York settled barely firmer after surging to life-of-contract highs across the board earlier. However, steady producer selling capped the rally. But the market managed to close slightly higher. July and October closed 3 points higher at 11.51 and 11.32 cents/lb respectively. The rally is purely technical and the market looks overbought, given current fundamentals.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>EUROPE - During the week ended June 4 the West European sugar beet areas experienced light rains. Sunshine helped the crop to develop. Eastern European beet areas received increased rainfall during each of the past weeks. This improved conditions in Bulgaria and Romania where it had been getting too dry. Crop prospects should now be average. The sugar beet areas in the former Soviet Union saw rainfall increase for the second week in a row. Soil moisture is now rated good for beets in the vegetative growth state. Overall, crop prospects in Europe now seem to be a little bit better than a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA - Sugar exports in April 1997 amounted to 144,955 tonnes, up on the 140,839 tonnes exported in March but down on the 198,965 tonnes shipped in April 1996. This brought cumulative exports in the first eleven months of 1996/97 (June/April) up to 4.106 million tonnes against 4.135 million tonnes in 1995/96. Total exports in 1995/96 amounted to 4.177 million tonnes, down from 4.479 million tonnes in 1994/95, but well above the 3.555 million tonnes shipped in 1993/94. Major countries of destination in June/April 1996/97 were Canada with 697,729 tonnes raws against 634,592 tonnes, South Korea with 638,324 tonnes, up from 605,695 tonnes, Japan with 598,330 tonnes, down from 706,819 tonnes and Malaysia with 597,758 tonnes against 602,925 tonnes.</p>
<p>White sugar exports continued at a slower pace in 1996/97 as compared to last year. Total white sugar exports in June/April 1996/97 amounted to 178,389 tonnes against 240,039 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Major countries of destination in 1996/97 were New Zealand with 42,596 tonnes against 12,726 tonnes and Indonesia with 58,480 tonnes, hardly changed from last year's 58,523 tonnes.</p>
<p>DENMARK - The weather in the week ended June 1 was cool and rainy with temperatures expected to rise over the weekend. Average temperatures are a little bit below the long-term mean. Precipitation levels since April 1 ranged between 82-140 mm compared to a long-term mean of 82-87 mm. Growth is reported to be good. Some farmers continued spraying herbicides but the bulk of the work has been completed. In various regions pest attacks damaged the crop. Overall crop prospects continue to be normal.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>The European Union awarded 87,750 tonnes of white sugar at a maximum refund of ECU 41.653 per 100 kg at its weekly tender on June 4. Cumulative awards so far made under the 1996/97 series of tenders for the period up to June 4 reached 2,185,625 tonnes, which compares to 2,261,698 tonnes last year.</p>
