<p>Processing at Ukraine's six oil refineries dropped to 2.15 million tonnes (equivalent to 172,000 bpd) in the first quarter of 1997 from 3.3 million tonnes (264,000 bpd) during the same period last year, the Statistics Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The volumes slipped on lower oil imports, Svetlana Nyfontova, head of the Economy Ministry's oil, refining and gas department, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since 1991, there has been a very steady drop in refining because of a drop in crude oil imports,&quot; she said, adding that refining levels had fallen three-fold since 1991.</p>
<p>The refineries routinely processed up to 60 million tonnes (1.2 million bpd) of oil in the Soviet era, but Ukraine has little cash to import oil from its main supplier, Russia.</p>
<p>Annual volumes dropped to 13 million tonnes (260,000 bpd) in 1996 from about 17 million tonnes (340,000 bpd) in 1995 and 38 million tonnes (760,000 bpd) in 1991.</p>
<p>Nyfontova said the only oil the refineries were guaranteed to receive was crude recovered on Ukrainian territory. Ukraine produces about four million tonnes of oil a year.</p>
<p>She said Ukraine received only 9,200 tonnes from Russia in the first quarter this year despite agreements to buy 21 million tonnes in 1997.</p>
<p>Ukraine has announced plans to privatise its refineries by offering stakes to foreign and local strategic investors.</p>
<p>Valery Kyrynyachenko, deputy head of the Economy Ministry's energy production department, said Ukraine was in discussions with the former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan to buy oil in the next two or three years in exchange for exploration rights.</p>
<p>He said the two sides were also examining the possibility of transporting Caspian oil to Europe across Ukraine. The oil would go from Baku, Azerbaijan to Poti, Georgia, and on to Odessa to the town of Brody in western Ukraine to meet the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline.</p>
