<p>Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum Co said Friday an oil discovery owned jointly with Enserch Exploration Inc in the War-Wink West field area in the Delaware Basin of West Texas is now producing at its expected allowable of 350 barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p>The University 18-34 number 1 well is also producing 374,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day with 3,700 pounds of flowing tubing pressure on a 7/64 inch choke. It tested at rates up to 720 barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p>The well was drilled to a total depth of 11,660 feet and oil was found in the third Bone Spring sand formation.  </p>
<p>Production tests were conducted over a gross interval of 150 feet below 11,400 feet, Parker &amp; Parsley said.</p>
<p>The War-Wink prospect is located a mile west of the War-Wink South Wolfcamp field, which was discovered in 1979 and has already produced 11.3 million barrelsl and 15 billion cubic feet of natural gas, the company noted.</p>
<p>A delineation well is planned about one mile to the west of this discovery. Parker &amp; Parsley said it expects to start a multi-well developmental drilling program in the 4,500 acre War-Wink prospect over the next few months.</p>
<p>Parker &amp; Parsley and Enserch also control some 30,000 additional acres in this Delaware Basin play in southeastern New Mexico and West Texas on which they have identified 13 additional exploration prospects where they intend to drill eight exploratory wells in 1997.</p>
