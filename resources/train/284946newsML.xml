<p>Boeing bid for McDonnell Douglas because it believed defence spending could start to grow again and it wanted to benefit from a larger military business, its chief executive was quoted as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>Philip Condit, who became Boeing's chief executive in April and takes over as chairman next month, told the Financial Times he did not believe it was a mistake to launch a takeover when defence spending was falling.</p>
<p>&quot;If I was making a five-year decision, I would say there would be real questions. But I'm looking 20 to 30 years ahead,&quot; Condit was quoted by the newspaper as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Much as I would like to say that we will never see defence spending rise again, history tells us that's not true,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>The paper reported that Condit said he had not received guarantees from Washington that the takeover, which would turn the new company into the world's largest defence and aerospace group in terms of sales, would be approved.</p>
<p>But it quoted him as saying there was little overlap between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which would make it easier for regulators to approve the deal.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has said the European Commission would have to assess whether the deal would strengthen Boeing's dominant position in Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry has also said the Pentagon could recommend divestiture to curb any anti-competitive impact on the defence industry, although he gave no indication the Pentagon would seek such action.</p>
<p>Condit told the paper Boeing would file documents to U.S. regulators next week. He expected shareholders to be asked to approve the deal in the spring and the takeover to be completed by the middle of this year, although it might take longer.</p>
<p>Condit said the merger would not restrict competition in the civil aircraft market.</p>
<p>A report last month in the Financial Times said Boeing moved swiftly on the bid because it feared McDonnell Douglas was about to bid for the defence operations of Hughes Electronics.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Condit did not deny this, but explained that his concern had been broader.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;It looked at things that were starting to move, and maybe move rapidly, in the next phase of defence industry consolidation. If we waited to see where it went, we might have been in a position where the cards had all been played.&quot;</p>
<p>Condit said separate teams would be set up to deal with the merger so others could get on with the business.</p>
<p>But he said savings would be achieved by not hiring staff, rather than redundancies.</p>
