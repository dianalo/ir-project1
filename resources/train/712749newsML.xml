<title>SLOVAKIA: Slovak banks move to clarify money trading rules.</title>
<headline>Slovak banks move to clarify money trading rules.</headline>
<dateline>BRATISLAVA 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>The eight largest Slovak money market players -- known as reference banks -- on Tuesday agreed on a series of obligatory measures aimed at improving trading rules on a market plagued by low liquidity.</p>
<p>The banks agreed that any reference bank must, if contacted, offer a bid price within a range of plus/minus 2.5 percent around the rate it is quoting on its Reuters page.</p>
<p>The agreement also says that if a bank quotes offer rate, it must also quote a bid price with a maximum spread of five percent.</p>
<p>The banks also agreed to standardise volumes traded on the market, setting a standard amount of 100 million Slovak crowns for maturities up to one month, 50 million for up to three month funds and 25 million crowns for four to six month money.</p>
<p>&quot;In general, this agreement should make trading more transparent and it should also push rates that banks quote on their pages closer to reality,&quot; said Rastislav Zivor of ING Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not mean that rates must fall now, but the market situation will become more clear, and this itself is a positive sign&quot; Zivor added.</p>
<p>The local money market has been plagued by low liquidity and uncertain trading conditions over the past two months.</p>
<p>The liquidity crunch came as the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) in mid-May moved to limit access to crown funds to protect the currency before speculative downward pressure.</p>
<p>The NBS move pushed rates to around 30 percent as the local banks for four consecutive times failed to meet their minimum reserves requirements.</p>
