<p>The United States on Thursday criticised Israeli and Palestinian leaders for attacking each other publicly after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged both sides to revive a spirit of partnership on peace.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman James Rubin noted that Albright, in a speech on Wednesday, &quot;talked a lot about the importance of partnership and building partnership if we're going to build peace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And we do not regard the statements that (Palestinian) Chairman (Yasser) Arafat made in this regard as helpful,&quot; he told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Arafat was quoted in an Israeli newspaper as saying measures imposed by Israel against Palestinians since a suicide bombing last week amounted to a declaration of war, and warned he was preparing accordingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu has declared war on us and we have to prepare for what will come. The situation is serious,&quot; Arafat was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Rubin said &quot;to the extent that (Arafat's statement) is ... interpreted as meaning battle with Israel, we regard them as counterproductive. And we think they should not be made.&quot;</p>
<p>He stressed that Arafat and his Palestinian Authority have committed themselves to a peace settlement with Israel and therefore &quot;should refrain from ... statements that cast doubt on the peace that they have committed themselves to.&quot;</p>
<p>Rubin was also asked about reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinian Authority of behaving &quot;like a regime facilitating terror, like Iran or Iraq or Libya.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to fathom how one could compare Chairman Arafat to Colonel (Muammar) Gaddafi,&quot; Rubin told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Chairman Arafat was on the White House lawn with the president. He signed a peace agreement with the Israelis. We regard him as a partner in our effort to find peace in the Middle East,&quot; he said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel Gaddafi is an international outlaw.&quot;</p>
<p>Aside from closing the border between Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, which stops trade and keeps thousands of Palestinians from jobs in Israel, Israel's treasury has frozen transfer of VAT and customs duties it owes the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Albright has been trying to broker an agreement under which Israel would agree to return the money if Palestinians take specific steps to crackdown on terrorism, U.S. officials say.</p>
