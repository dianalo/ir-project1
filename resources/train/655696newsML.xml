<p>Europe's major airlines carried more passengers over longer distances in 1996 but limped in with collective operating losses projected at $90 million, down on 1995's $870 million profit, industry association AEA said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Passenger traffic increases of 6.2 percent and a rise of 7.9 percent in total distance flown were offset by poorer revenue/cost yields and increased fuel prices, the Association of European Airlines said in its 1997 yearbook.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems as if the good 1995 result was only a 'flash in the pan' in a series of many years of losses,&quot; AEA secretary general Karl-Heinz Neumeister told a news conference.</p>
<p>Profits in 1995 followed five years of collective losses.</p>
<p>Neumeister said increased passenger numbers failed to help bottom-line profits because airlines had filled surplus seats by offering promotional fares.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes airlines get a bit nervous when they see their bookings and additional capacity was certainly filled by attractive offers,&quot; he told the launch news conference.</p>
<p>Neumeister nevertheless predicted better results in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;If one were to make a forecast it would be better. I think when we meet next year, we will probably be in a position to say that 1997 was better than 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Association members include all the major west European flag carriers and some from central Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, meaning combined figures pool results from a very mixed bag of airlines.</p>
<p>The AEA said passenger figures grew most on long-haul routes, up 8.7 percent, compared with 5.1 percent within Europe.</p>
<p>Load factors, the ratio of seats offered to seats filled, showed a similar picture with a record 74.7 percent on long-haul flights in 1996 compared with 61.6 percent within Europe.</p>
<p>The collective fleet of the 26 AEA airlines stood at 1,769 aircraft at the end of last year, virtually static on the year.</p>
<p>The association gave data showing that of the passenger jet aircraft flown by AEA members last year, 47 percent were Boeings , 22 percent McDonnell Douglas , 20 percent Airbus and 11 percent other manufacturers.</p>
<p>Figures for aircraft on order looked better for the European consortium, which held 43 percent of the 301 aircraft on order as opposed to Boeing's 45 percent.</p>
<p>Neumeister refused to be drawn into detailed comment on Thursday's start of a two-day European Commission hearing into the competition effects of Boeing's $14-billion takeover of McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as airlines have the choice of at least two (manufacturers) in each category of aircraft, we would probably not make too much noise,&quot; he said. REUTER</p>
