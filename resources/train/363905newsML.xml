<p>Shrugging off a substantial rise in the January U.S. payrolls figure and seizing on broad weakness in other areas of the report, economists predicted on Friday that the Federal Reserve will continue to hold interest rates steady in the coming months.</p>
<p>They noted however, that seasonal factors and harsh winter weather distorted key components of the report, and said that a better reading of underlying labor market trends will have to wait until more data is available.  </p>
<p>&quot;Looking past the payrolls number, it seems like this is a very weak report because of the plunge in the workweek,&quot; said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;My feeling is that it is largely weather related and doesn't reflect any fundamental weakness in economic activity ... but it is very consistent with my view that the Fed stays on hold into the spring,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday that the economy added 271,000 non-farm jobs in January, higher than Wall Street forecasts for a 237,000 rise.  </p>
<p>But the report also showed an unusually sharp drop in average weekly hours worked, a phenomenon which Labor Department economist Harvey Hamel attributed to poor weather conditions.</p>
<p>The workweek declined to 34.1 hours in January from 34.8 hours in December, while average hourly earnings -- a key gauge of wage pressures -- rose by a paltry one cent, after substantial advances in November and December.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unemployment rate edged up to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent, a reassuring sign to economists worried about excessive labor market tightness.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're discounting the strength in the headline number because of the seasonals,&quot; said Joseph Liro, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc, noting that seasonal factors may have overcompensated in accounting for typical year-end layoffs.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in the unemployment rate and the drop in hours worked dominate everything else and keep the Fed on the sidelines,&quot; he predicted.</p>
<p>The Labor Department's Hamel said that despite the retreat in hours worked and the meager earnings gain for January, the trend in both components was still on the rise.  </p>
<p>He also said that seasonal factors may have exaggerated jobs gains in the service sector, but that any distortions probably did not alter the overall employment picture for January.</p>
<p>That picture was one of decent labor market momentum, without worrisome signs of wage inflation, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw an upward revision to November so we're seeing real strong fourth quarter employment growth carrying at least somewhat into the first quarter,&quot; said Liro.</p>
<p>The headline payrolls figure for November was revised up to 181,000 from a previous reading of 127,000.  </p>
<p>Beginning in January, the Labor Department said that new revisions to the household survey -- which is used to calculate the unemployment rate -- had been introduced, reflecting improved information on the demographic characteristics of U.S. immigrants and emigrants.</p>
<p>However, Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the unemployment rate was not affected by the revision.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters had been calling for a dip in the unemployment rate to 5.2 percent in January.</p>
<p>The average workweek had been expected to retreat to 34.6 hours, while growth in average hourly earnings was seen slowing to 0.2 percent.</p>
