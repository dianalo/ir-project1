<p>At least 34 separatist Tamil rebels and seven government soldiers were killed in an early morning rebel assault on the military's defences near the northern town of Vavuniya on Tuesday, military officials in the north said.</p>
<p>Ground troops confirmed 34 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were killed when the rebels attacked the military's forward defence line at Thandikulam, just north of the government-controlled frontline town of Vavuniya, they said.</p>
<p>Vavuniya is 220 km (135 miles) north of Colombo.</p>
<p>Three soldiers, two sailors and two special forces troopers were killed, while more than 27 soldiers were wounded, military officials said.</p>
<p>An aid worker in Vavuniya told Reuters that three civilians, including a seven-year-old girl, had been killed in the fighting. Some 28 people were wounded and admitted to Vavuniya hospital, he said.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry said the LTTE, fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils in mostly Sinhalese Sri Lanka's north and east, launched the attack in a bid to cut off supplies to troops fighting further north.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said more than 500 rebels had tried to dislodge the military's field headquarters and artillery positions at Thandikulam in order to disrupt an offensive against the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;But troops fought back valiantly to repulse the attack, causing very heavy casualties among the terrorists,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The rebels warned that such surprise attacks could take place more often.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sri Lanka army can expect many more military disasters like this in coming weeks,&quot; LTTE's international spokesman, Anton Rajah, told Reuters from London.</p>
<p>Military officials said the rebels blew up a key bridge at Nochchimoddai, just north of Thandikulam, from where security forces launched Operation &quot;Jaya Sikuru&quot;, or &quot;Sure of Victory&quot;, on the rebels' northern Wanni stronghold nearly one month ago.</p>
<p>An ammunition dump was destroyed when a rebel mortar round hit it, the ministry statement said.</p>
<p>Mi-24 helicopter gunships and Pucara ground attack planes had fired at the rebels from the air, causing them to flee into nearby jungle, the officials said.</p>
<p>The rebels had fired about 25 artillery rounds, some of which exploded near the Vavuniya air force base but caused little damage, they added.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry spokesman said the attack would not be a setback to troops who had already captured several rebel-held towns in the Wanni, driving the LTTE further north.</p>
<p>&quot;By this evening, we will take full control of the situation (at Nochchimoddai), allowing troops to carry on with the offensive,&quot; he said. &quot;We have enough troops to guard the rear and advance at the same time.&quot;</p>
<p>But residents in Vavuniya said they could hear artillery shells exploding to the north at 5.00 p.m (1100 GMT), which meant fighting was still continuing at Thandikulam.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be a long night for us,&quot; one resident said.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
