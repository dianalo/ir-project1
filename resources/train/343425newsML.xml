<p>Rebels in eastern Zaire were reported to be pushing south and west on Thursday, opening new fronts to frustrate a counter-offensive by government forces backed by foreign mercenaries.</p>
<p>The rebel targets were Kalemie, on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika, and Lubutu, a key town on the road to the Zairean army's main base at Kisangani, sources inside Zaire and in Rwanda told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy is clearly to stretch out the front as far as possible,&quot; a western diplomat in neighbouring Rwanda said.</p>
<p>After losing a long thin strip of eastern territory to Laurent Kabila's rebels late last year, Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko launched his army's counter-attack this month.</p>
<p>Zaire has significantly increased its arsenal, importing combat helicopters, fighter jets, artillery and munitions as well as around 300 foreign mercenaries.</p>
<p>Zaire claimed some early successes but accused Uganda on Wednesday of pouring at least 8,000 troops into the east to shore up their rebel allies. Uganda dismissed the charge.</p>
<p>A Rwandan official monitoring events from Kigali said rebels who took the town of Lulimba on Wednesday were heading to Kalemie, 130 km (80 miles) further south: &quot;I think they want to cut off Lake Tanganyika from government forces.&quot;</p>
<p>The push for Kalemie, Kabila's home town, was confirmed by aid workers in eastern Zaire. A defence ministry official in Kinshasa admitted on Wednesday the rebels had reached Lulimba.</p>
<p>&quot;I dont think the rebels will find any resistance there (Kalemie) as there are few if any government soldiers there,&quot; a foreign resident in rebel-held Bukavu said by telephone.</p>
<p>Residents said the main rebel towns of Goma, Bukavu and Uvira were all quiet on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the western front, diplomats and aid workers said the rebels were in full control of Walikale, contrary to Zaire's claims its troops recaptured the town on January 22.</p>
<p>The Rwandan official said the rebels were now heading for Lubutu, 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Kisangani where thousands of government troops and the mercenaries are based.</p>
<p>&quot;Walikale was attacked last week by helicopters but the rebels responded with anti-aircraft guns. The rebels say they are now moving on towards Lubutu,&quot; a senior aid worker in eastern Zaire said.</p>
<p>Zaire's indisciplined army was routed by the rebels last year. Diplomats say it is too early to know if a reorganisation, the mercenaries and new weapons would turn the tide.</p>
<p>Exiled Rwandan Hutu sources in Nairobi said the pro-Mobutu rump of the former Rwandan army, the FAR, was in Lubutu with orders to defend it.</p>
<p>&quot;By opening up many fronts, the rebels are taxing government forces and disorganising the planned counter-offensive on Goma, Bukavu and Bunia,&quot; the Rwandan official said.</p>
<p>The army and independent sources in Kinshasa have reported clashes near Bunia, the rebels' northern-most stronghold on the Ugandan border.</p>
<p>&quot;So far as we know Bunia has remained in rebel hands. But it is completely cut off and we have reports that cholera and plague are breaking out,&quot; a foreign aid worker in Goma said.</p>
<p>Belgium's foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday Brussels had increasing reports about the presence of Rwandan troops in eastern Zaire. Rwanda's government, which does not hide its sympathy for the rebels, denied the reports.</p>
