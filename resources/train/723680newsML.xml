<p>The Protestant Orange Order has called off flashpoint parades in Northern Ireland this weekend to avoid possible loss of life after a tide of Catholic anger and a week of violence across the province.</p>
<p>The Order said in a statement on Thursday night the violent protests had been inspired by Sinn Fein, political wing of IRA guerrillas fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland, but added that it was calling off the parades &quot;for the greater good of the province&quot;.</p>
<p>The decision, unprecedented in the organisation's centuries-old history, was greeted with relief by leading figures on both sides of the province's religious and political divide.</p>
<p>It ended a week-long standoff between the Order and Catholic residents' associations across the province who had threatened to block the parades which they regard as sectarian intimidation on their doorsteps.</p>
<p>The Order, founded to celebrate its Protestant faith and British loyalty, called off parades in Belfast's Lower Ormeau Road and the towns of Newry and Armgh. It said was rerouting a march in Londonderry.</p>
<p>&quot;This week in particular has witnessed Sinn Fein/IRA inspired violence throughout the province and there are indications of more serious republican violence and actions deliberately designed to provoke members of the Orange Institution,&quot; the Order's statement said.</p>
<p>The parades are traditionally held on the &quot;Glorious 12th&quot; of July, which marks a 1690 victory by a Protestant king over an invading Catholic monarch that ensured a Protestant ascended to the British throne.</p>
<p>It is also seen as a key date in entrenching eventual Protestant domination of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Donaldson, a senior Orange official, said: &quot;These decisions were decisions of local lodges. This is not something that was imposed on them. I must say they have my utmost admiration.&quot;</p>
<p>Police had voiced serious concern about the Lower Ormeau Road march, scene of violent confrontation in recent years between police and demonstrators.</p>
<p>The decision not to parade in the Belfast suburb was announced by the Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge at the Protestant end of the Lower Ormeau Road.</p>
<p>Outside the lodge a small but angry crowd gathered, plainly displeased at the decision to call off their march. They jostled journalists, forcing them away from the lodge entrance.</p>
<p>Billy Hoey, a Protestant churchman, said: &quot;They are a bit upset as you can understand because this district has withdrawn (from Saturday's parade).&quot;</p>
<p>The Order, which wants to maintain the province's 300-year-old union with Britain, had come under intense pressure to cancel the parades after week-long violence caused by a march through a Catholic area in the town of Portadown last Sunday.</p>
<p>Political sources said Northern Ireland police chief Ronnie Flanagan told leaders of the Orange Order earlier in the day that he could not guarantee the safety of marchers in Belfast because of calls by Catholic residents assocations for mass protests.</p>
<p>Sir John Alderdice of the moderate Alliance Party said: &quot;It's quite remarkable. Good sense has won. The only losers are people who wanted trouble, who wanted violence.&quot;</p>
<p>The issue polarised the province between Protestants, who want it to remain British, and Catholics, who want eventual unification with Ireland.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams quickly issued a statement welcoming a decision he had campaigned for for years.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome these decisions and acknowledge their significance,&quot; he said. &quot;I wish it had been made earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to last Sunday's Orange Order parade through the Catholic Garvaghy Road area of Portadown which sparked the worst violence the province has seen for years.</p>
