<p>Former Olympic and world 100 metres champion Linford Christie suffered a miserable start to the new season at the inaugural men-only Qatar International meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>He was beaten into second place by Jamaica's Raymond Stewart in the 100 metres. Stewart clocked 10.11 seconds to Christie's 10.15, with Michael Green of Jamaica third in 10.17.</p>
<p>Christie then finished fourth over 200 metres in 20.59 behind Belgian Patrick Stevens, the winner in 20.31. American duo Brian Bronson and Roshan Griffin were second and third respectively in 20.36 and 20.55.</p>
<p>&quot;You win some you lose some,&quot; said Christie who was paid $25,000 appearance money. &quot;I've been Olympic and world champion, so I have nothing to prove,&quot; added the Briton, who said earlier this week that he has no intention of competing in the world championships in August. He has opted instead to appear in smaller meetings as he winds down his long career.</p>
<p>World record holder Colin Jackson of Britain was second in the 110 metres hurdles behind Jack Pierce, with fellow American Roger Kingdom third.</p>
<p>World record holder Butch Reynolds was second in the 400 metres won by Jamaica's Michael McDonald, who clocked 44.79.</p>
<p>No women were allowed to compete in the Moslem Gulf Arab state.</p>
