<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Monday that approval of the 1998 budget law could be moved forward to mid-summer if parliament approved.</p>
<p>Ciampi was quoted by Italian media as telling Italian reporters in Brussels the budget could be approved as early as August 15 if political forces were committed.</p>
<p>&quot;Moving approval of the 1998 budget forward has its validity. It would mean moving forward parliamentary discussion on the budget to be able to end up with approval before August 15,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The budget is usually approved by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Ciampi said moving approval of the budget forward would need a &quot;clear commitment&quot; by coalition and opposition parties otherwise more harm than good would be done. He said such a move would be a clear signal that Italy wanted to take part in the the first wave of European Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the opposition Freedom Alliance, said Ciampi's proposal should be taken seriously because it would benefit the country, but added that he believed it would be very difficult.</p>
