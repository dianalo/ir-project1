<p>Israel posted a budget surplus of 188 million shekels in March, preliminary figures released by the Treasury on Wednesday show.</p>
<p>			 March 1997    Feb 1997     March 1996</p>
<p> Budget balance     +  188	  - 559	  - 1,001</p>
<p> Expenditures	 13,567	  9,899	   10,815</p>
<p> Receipts	     14,110	  9,534	   10,184</p>
<p>Note: Figures are in millions of shekels. They do not include credit granted.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the government posted a 1.37 billion shekels deficit for the first quarter, including both the domestic and foreign components. It would not say how far the deficit exceeded the target, but one official estimated it could be as much as one billion shekels.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Dan Meridor, who has promised to review spending at the end of the quarter, said it was too early to say how the Treasury would respond.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only say after we've analysed them (the figures) and then we'll decide if there is a need for a budget cut and if so how much and how we'll go about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>David Brodett, who wound up his last day as Treasury director-general March 31, conceded that &quot;there is a certain deviation&quot; but said spending cuts should be contingent on the Bank of Israel lowering interest rates.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the domestic surplus in March was 203 million shekels.</p>
<p>Officials have been stressing the domestic figure over the aggregate one because U.S. economic aid is expected to cover the foreign deficit when it is disbursed towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it had absorbed 1.47 billion shekels in March, bringing the figure for the first quarter to 2.82 billion shekels.</p>
<p>It said it raised a net 415 million shekels in the domestic capital market and raised 711 million shekels in proceeds from privatisations.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.36 shekels)</p>
