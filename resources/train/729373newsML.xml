<p>The murder on Tuesday of designer Gianni Versace in the heart of super trendy Miami Beach was a blow to a city that promotes itself as a fashion and tourist paradise while grappling with an image of a dangerous area thick with crime.</p>
<p>Tourist offices were flooded with telephone calls almost as soon as the news broke that the world-renowned designer had been gunned down on the steps of his mansion in South Beach, a glitzy area of upscale restaurants, art deco hotels and white sand beaches.</p>
<p>&quot;We're a little overwhelmed with calls right now,&quot; said a spokeswoman at the Greater Miami Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.</p>
<p>The local fashion industry also reeled, as models, editors and businesses that rely on them reacted to the loss of a man credited with putting South Beach on the style map.</p>
<p>&quot;What does Versace do for clothing? What does Versace do for boutiques? He gives a name, he gives credibility. He was the stamp of approval,&quot; said Jack Donahue, associate publisher of Fashion Spectrum, a regional magazine on the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Gianni Versace was a worldwide personality, so for the people who work here on Ocean Drive, it's really awful,&quot; said Eddie Bianchi, owner of a rollerblade shop near the Versace mansion. He said he heard the fatal shots.</p>
<p>The designer was shot twice in the head as he finished his daily walk to buy newspapers at the News Cafe, a beachfront spot known as a haven for the Miami Beach glamour elite.</p>
<p>Nine European tourists were murdered in Florida during a 12-month period in 1992-93, some of the most publicised of those attacks in Miami. Publicity about the killings, and a citywide murder rate that has remained one of the highest in the United States, scared many potential visitors away from southern Florida.</p>
<p>The German government even drew up formal guidelines for visitors to the area, including a warning not to stop for strangers and to avoid central Miami and Miami Beach after dark. &quot;Miami has such a bad reputation in Germany. This is very, very bad,&quot; said Britt Steinhardt, a German flight attendant who lives part-time in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>Miami and Miami Beach are technically separate cities, a point that Miami Beach officials have been anxious to make as Miami sweated out a series of corruption scandals. But as far as tourists, businessmen and most residents are concerned, the two cities are perceived as one.</p>
<p>The decline in visitors after the 1992-93 murders was devastating to tourism, an industry considered crucial to the region's economy. Tourists spent $10.9 billion in greater Miami last year, indicating tourism has rebounded.</p>
<p>Yet industry professionals said the Miami area is still vulnerable to any bad news.</p>
<p>&quot;After some incident, whatever it happens to be ... it's almost like an airline accident, where you have a period of heightened awareness for a little while,&quot; said Chris Privett, senior manager of communications at the American Society of Travel Agents.</p>
<p>The region was so concerned with its image that it kept a crowd of some 100 journalists waiting for 90 minutes in 90-degree heat for Dade County's mayor to show up on Tuesday and assure a news conference the Miami Beach police called on Versace's death that the city was still safe.</p>
<p>&quot;The information that we now have suggests that this terrible crime was an extraordinary occurrence and not just a random robbery,&quot; Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas said. &quot;Let me assure you that Miami Beach and Dade County are safe despite this terrible incident.&quot;</p>
