<p>More than half of the seriously injured people who go for treatment at trauma centers across the United States may be abusing alcohol or other drugs, a study said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The estimate was based on a study of more than 1,000 seriously injured patients at the University of Maryland's Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, a facility described as typical of other such centers across the country in terms of the patients it receives.</p>
<p>Researchers at the center said more than 54 percent of the seriously injured patients treated had a psychoactive substance abuse disorder or had previously been diagnosed with one. Psychoactive substances include alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;Our data suggest that seriously injured trauma center patients manifest more severe forms of addiction than the general population ...&quot; the report, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, said.</p>
<p>The injuries included both accidents and &quot;intentional&quot; injuries such a gunshot wounds. The authors of the study suggested that trauma centers routinely test or screen for drug or alcohol use and refer patients for help.</p>
