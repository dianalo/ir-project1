<p>Tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand was again in the limelight after his fate became a last-minute deal breaker in the historic $368.5 billion settlement agreed to by the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>State attorneys general who struck the proposed agreement insisted the former tobacco executive be shielded from future industry legal action -- a demand Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. found tough to accept for its former employee.</p>
<p>&quot;We were willing to walk away from this deal if they were going to continue to harass and try to ruin Jeffrey's life. And for about two hours there, it appeared that at least one company was willing to do that, as stupid as that sounds,&quot; Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore told a news conference on Friday after announcing the settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;We hung in there tough, and again, they conceded, they blinked,&quot; added Moore, who explained that he and his fellow attorneys general made sure &quot;we didn't leave any prisoners or hostages on the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't the first time the 54-year old Wigand -- the highest ranking tobacco executive to blow the whistle on his former industry -- was at the center of controversy.</p>
<p>Controversy has been at the center of his life since he was fired in 1993 from Brown &amp; Williamson, where he had been head of research and development since 1989 and took down a six-figure salary.</p>
<p>Wigand dropped a bombshell when he accused the chairman of Brown &amp; Williamson of lying under oath to Congress in 1994 when he said he did not believe toacco was addictive.</p>
<p>Wigand also charged that industry officials controlled nicotine levels in cigarettes and shielded important research on smoking from the public.</p>
<p>He cooperated with a federal probe into the tobacco industry and made his views known through the CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Wigand told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; he &quot;felt an obligation to tell the truth&quot; about his former employer. &quot;There were things I saw. There were things I learned. There were things I observed that I felt that needed to be told.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We stood for Jeff Wigand because he has stood four-square for public health and the American people,&quot; said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.</p>
<p>Tobacco industry representatives had begged to differ. Louisville, Ky.-based Brown &amp; Williamson sued Wigand in November 1995, accusing him of breaking confidentiality agreements. The company insisted he was a liar.</p>
<p>Wigand testified in court documents that he and members of his family received anonymous threats and faced pressure to keep mum.</p>
<p>It was revealed on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that a .38-caliber bullet and a threatening letter were sent to Wigand in January 1996. &quot;We want you to know that we have not forgotten you or your little brats,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>Wigand said he decided to carry a gun.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Wigand put his livelihood on the line to tell all of us in America the truth about the tobacco industry, a true American hero,&quot; Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth said.</p>
<p>Wigand's professional life has changed dramatically since he left the tobacco business. Today, he teaches science and Japanese at a Louisville high school -- and earns a reported $30,400 a year.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel great,&quot; Wigand was quoted in Saturday's edition of The New York Times as saying on the day of the settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;Great for myself, for the American public, and for the kids.&quot; Asked if he would again blow the whistle on the tobacco industry, he responded: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
