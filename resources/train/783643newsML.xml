<p>Jakarta stocks are seen soft in slow trading on Wednesday as sentiment remains cautious on reports of higher interest rates, while the market focus is seen on Jakarta Kyoei Steel, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank's recent tight rupiah policy, which led some big banks to raise interest rates, is likely to keep sentiment weak,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Concerns over the higher interest rates and poor first half results of some big capitalised firms dragged the Jakarta composite index down by 4.83 points to close at 713.88 points on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the market focus was likely to be on Kyoei Steel as the steel firm was scheduled to debut on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Kyoei is expected to attract attention, but it is unlikely to stage a strong debut due to generally weak market sentiment,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Kyoei managed to stage a modest debut despite overall weak market sentiment due partly to some supports from its underwriters,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>Kyoei was traded at 775 rupiah against an initial offer price of 650 rupiah. It opened at 800 rupiah and touched a high of 825 rupiah.</p>
