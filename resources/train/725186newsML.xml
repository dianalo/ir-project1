<p>Transport Minister Vilis Krishtopans on Monday said he would not resign although the prosecutor's office found he had broken anti-corruption laws.</p>
<p>Krishtopans also criticised the prosecutor's office and called for an end to what he called a &quot;witch hunt&quot; over the anti-corrption legislation.</p>
<p>Krishtopans said in a statement read at a news conference that it was no secret he had come to politics from business but now he felt he was fully a politician.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not intend to resign as that would be a sign of weakness at a time when many people trust me and a sign of sins I have not committed,&quot; Krishtopans said.</p>
<p>He said he had not spoken with Prime Minister Andris Shkele but did not think the premier would ask for his resignation.</p>
<p>Krishtopans said he had never hidden his past business links and criticised the prosecutor's office.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the prosecutor's office should look into more serious things,&quot; Krishtopans said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to call on all to stop this senseless witch hunt and devote more attention to things where one can see real corruption with the naked eye,&quot; Krishtopans added.</p>
<p>Several ministers have resigned amid the investigations under the anti-corruption laws, which mainly involves findings that people held official and business posts at the same time.</p>
