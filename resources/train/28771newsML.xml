<title>USA: Argentina bonds surge, as Bulgarian Bradies suffer.</title>
<headline>Argentina bonds surge, as Bulgarian Bradies suffer.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine Brady bonds surged on Tuesday amid local optimism and news of fresh Eurobonds, while Bulgarian paper slumped after the International Monetary Fund postponed a loan disbursement.</p>
<p>One emerging market debt trader cited strong local interest in Buenos Aires for Argentine paper, prompting Argentine FRBs to gain 1-1/4 for a bid price of 78-7/8.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the local guys are more comfortable with the risk today,&quot; the trader said.  </p>
<p>Players also seemed comforted by Argentina's launching of two 350 million mark Eurobond issues, of seven and 20-year maturities, via lead manager CSFB-Effectenbank.</p>
<p>&quot;Argentina got a good bounce,&quot; said another Brady bond debt trader at a U.S. investment bank. &quot;We saw some selling of Bulgaria for Venezuela or Argentina.&quot;</p>
<p>Venezuelan DCBs outperformed Tuesday, gaining 5/8 to 76 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>The main loser was Bulgaria, which saw its Brady prices drop sharply after the IMF said it would put off paying out a second $115 million tranche until October at the earliest.  </p>
<p>Bulgarian IABs came off their lows in the U.S. afternoon, but still closed off 2-5/8 at 42-3/8.</p>
<p>The overall Brady market trailed U.S. Treasuries higher though lagged T-bond prices amid lingering concerns that U.S. interest rates are heading higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is going to remain vulnerable to higher US rates,&quot; said Joyce Chang, managing director at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>The surge in oil prices after the recent escalation of tensions in Iraq may carry over to the emerging debt market, Chang said.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be more certainty about how the oil-exporting countries fare amid higher U.S. rates,&quot; Chang said. &quot;That's quite positive for a number of countries -- Algeria, Ecuador Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela.&quot;</p>
<p>Philippine paper performed solidly in the wake of the country's plan to issue $2.0 billion of Eurobonds in buy back Brady debt.</p>
