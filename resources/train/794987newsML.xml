<p>Shanghai copper futures ended mostly down on Tuesday on profit-taking from retail investors, triggered by overnight losses on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.</p>
<p>LME copper fell prey to liquidation on Monday afternoon, briefly tested $2,270 and ended down $14 at $2,274 per tonne.</p>
<p>London analysts said LME copper had run out of steam and would probably test chart support at $2,270 per tonne on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>In Shanghai, the most actively traded December 1997 contract ended at 21,300 yuan ($2,569) per tonne, losing 280 yuan. It opened at an intraday high of 21,500 and hit a low of 21,270 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>August was unchanged at 20,800, September fell 200 to 20,900, October 220 to 21,180, November 280 to 21,300 and the January 1997 contract 310 to 21,240 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 32,310 tonnes from 59,120 tonnes.</p>
<p>Copper opened lower but mostly at intraday highs and fell steadily before most contracts closing near lows.  </p>
<p>Traders said some investors took advantage of the LME losses to cash in but further sharp falls seemed unlikely in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;LME losses triggered profit-taking but volume was thin, indicating many investors were still staying on the sidelines,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper is likely to find strong support at the 21,000-yuan level unless we here some significant negative market-moving news,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Shanghai physical copper was around the 20,750/20,850-yuan level due to a lack of end-user buying, traders said.  </p>
<p>Traders said they expected copper to consolidate around current levels for the next few days.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down on profit-taking.</p>
<p>August fell 270 to 14,550 yuan per tonne, September 300 to 14,800, October 350 to 14,950, November 320 to 15,100 and December 150 to 15,280 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 5,320 tonnes from 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>($1=8.2885 yuan)</p>
