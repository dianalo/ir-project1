<p>Federal Reserve policy-makers meet on  Tuesday to consider raising interest rates for the second time in three months in what would be a politically controversial move to stay a step ahead of inflation.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts are virtually split down the middle over whether or not the central bank will act to push up short-term rates by another quarter percentage point.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is pretty confused at this point,&quot; said Dave Connors, manager of government bond trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. &quot;If you ask most people their opinion, the honest answer is, 'I don't know.'&quot;</p>
<p>A rate increase would mean higher borrowing costs for everyone from consumers using credit cars to the stores where they shop. It would also likely disrupt financial markets.</p>
<p>Arguing for another rate rise: an economy that has been growing too quickly for its own good, a tight jobs market (the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in over 23 years), rising wages and a stock market that may be too exuberant.</p>
<p>Arguing against: an expected slowdown in the economy, scant sign of any pick-up in inflation, increased worker productivity and spare capacity in the industrial sector.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a tough call,&quot; said one Fed official, who declined to be identified. &quot;It's hard to have a great deal of conviction.&quot;</p>
<p>At its last meeting on March 25, the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee raised short-term rates for the first time in more than two years, bumping them up by a quarter percentage point.</p>
<p>The federal funds rate -- the rate commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans -- now stands at 5.5 percent. The discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges the banks for money -- is 5.00 (corrects from 5.25) percent.</p>
<p>An unusual alliance of corporations and labour unions, conservatives and liberals is already lining up to attack the Fed if it decides to tighten credit further.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Fed raises rates again, just to make sure workers don't finally get to benefit from this long recovery, we will surely see protests all over the country,&quot; said Roger Hickey, co-director of the liberal Campaign for America's Future.</p>
<p>In a speech in New York earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan vociferously defended the March rate increase, calling it a prudent step to guard against inflation and likening it to a vaccination to prevent a serious disease.</p>
<p>But he steered clear of spelling out what he intends to do on Tuesday, although he did say the Fed would need to raise rates again if economic growth fails to slow down as expected.</p>
<p>Growth does seem to be moderating from its rapid rate of the first quarter, when the economy expanded at its fastest clip in more than nine years. Sales at retail stores dropped in April and industrial production was flat.</p>
<p>But it is not clear how long the slowdown will last, analysts say. Jobs are plentiful and consumers are confident, pointing to the likelihood of a pick-up later this year.</p>
<p>The recent fall of the dollar and the rise of the stock and bond markets should also help underpin growth, analysts said.</p>
<p>The dollar's drop make U.S. goods more competitive on world markets, boosting exports. The rise of the bond market means lower long-term interest rates, encouraging home buyers, and the buoyant stock market makes investors feel richer.</p>
<p>Joel Prakken, Chairman of St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers, said he expects the Fed to raise rates on Tuesday. Even though growth looks set to slow, the economy may have already overshot its potential, raising the risk of inflation, he said.</p>
<p>Former Fed governor Lyle Gramley agreed that the central bank will eventually need to increase rates further to make sure that inflation does not pick up. But he saw no urgency in acting now and does not expect a move on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The chances are less than 50-50 they will (act),&quot; said Gramley, now a consultant at the Mortgage Bankers Association. But he added that it was a tough call.</p>
