<title>NEW ZEALAND: Kiwi dollar ends easier, seen struggling for grip.</title>
<headline>Kiwi dollar ends easier, seen struggling for grip.</headline>

<p>The New Zealand dollar closed a touch easier on Wednesday and was likely to continue to struggle in the medium term, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Kiwi ended at US$0.6900/07 from 0.6913/20 at the open. On its Trade-Weighted Index, it closed at 67.65 from 67.60.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall we're still holding the US$0.6890-0.6900 level, but struggling to make any progress on the upside,&quot; said a bank chief dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;That's against a backdrop of a firmer U.S. dollar and a firmer Aussie, so that's a negative and a positive for the Kiwi and sort of leaves us going nowhere quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>The Australian unit was closing in New Zealand at US$0.7655/60, up from Tuesday's 0.7645/50 close.</p>
<p>The dealer said there was still good interest in the Kiwi.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen continued interest out there to buy Kiwi against Aussie from U.S. accounts. Against that we've seen some Asian selling in the Kiwi.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall it looks as though the Kiwi will struggle.&quot;</p>
<p>The market's focus was turning more and more towards June 27, when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) delivers its Monetary Policy Statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The overriding perception is clearly that the RBNZ will sanction an easing,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess where people maybe differ slightly is the size of that easing.&quot;</p>
<p>The NZ dollar was seen trading a 0.6890-6915 range overnight.</p>
