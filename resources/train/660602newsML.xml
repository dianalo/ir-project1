<p>Two Dutch energy companies have unveiled plans to build Europe's biggest wind farm aimed at significantly boosting the country's renewable power output by the the year 2000.</p>
<p>The plan envisages the construction of 60 wind turbines along the Afsluitdijk, a 30 kilometer man-made causeway which encloses the Dutch inland sea, the Ijsselmeer.</p>
<p>The energy companies, Energie Noord West (ENW) and Nuon, said on Friday they hoped the first turbines will come into operation in the year 2000. Eventually, the farm will produce 100 megawatts of electricity, enough to satisfy 70,000 households.</p>
<p>This would make it some three times the size of the Europe's current largest wind farm, the 33.6 MW Carno complex in Wales.</p>
<p>Finances for the scheme are expected to run to 250 million guilders ($129 million).</p>
<p>The wind power project is a response to the Dutch government's aim of increasing the proportion of energy derived from renewable sources from its current one percent to 10 percent by the year 2020.</p>
<p>With limited sunshine, barely any geothermal energy sources and little scope for hydro stations, wind power will remain a backbone of the Netherlands' green push.</p>
<p>However, even the additional 100 MW produced from the latest project would be less than one percent of the country's electricity production.</p>
<p>For the moment, three plans are being considered for the new project. Two propose a line of turbines running parallel to, and either outside or inside, the Afsluitdijk. The other involves a cluster of turbines at the southern end.</p>
<p>According to ENW, a line of turbines would be more picturesque.</p>
<p>The plans are still awaiting the approval of Friesland and North Holland, the provinces at either end of the Afsluitdijk.</p>
<p>Environmental bodies have by and large welcomed the initiative, with certain reservations.</p>
<p>The Waddenvereniging, a local environmental lobby group, says it is concerned about the effect on local birdlife and the unsightly nature of the turbines.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not really for or against. We are rather wary about the scheme, although we are generally in favour of wind energy,&quot; said a spokesman.</p>
<p>Dutch Friends of the Earth campaigner Wim Kersten said studies showed only a very small proportion of bird deaths are caused by wind rotors and that the public would have to come to terms with a proliferation of turbines.</p>
<p>&quot;Wind turbines will be part of the new physical environment, like electricity lines. They may be seen rather like the classic windmills,&quot; Kersten said.</p>
<p>Energie Noord West has promised to ensure damage to the environment is kept at an absolute minimum.</p>
<p>But the plan has run into criticism, falling foul of provincial revivalry.</p>
<p>A press conference on Wednesday was originally planned to feature both ENW and Nuon, but Nuon pulled out after it became clear the province of Friesland, in which it operates, was far from happy with the plan.</p>
<p>According to Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad, the Friesland authorities were unhappy with the lack of cooperation they encountered when they launched their own plan two years ago.</p>
