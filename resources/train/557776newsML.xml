<p>Following are views on the direction of Philippine stocks on Friday and main factors likely to affect trading.</p>
<p>* Philippine shares are seen to pursuing their downward bias on a lack of investor confidence in the overall market helped by the Dow's and PLDT's fall in New York, Ramon Saulo, senior investment analyst at Asiamerit Securities said.</p>
<p>* The downtrend is likely to continue as investors doubt positive first quarter earnings of property and banking firms can be sustained, said Anscor-Hagedorn research head Noel Reyes.  </p>
<p>* The Philippine share market was closed on Thursday due to a public holiday for the Labour Day celebration. On Wednesday, the main stock market index plunged by 60.27 points at 2,648.17.</p>

<p>* Robinson's Land Corp said its net income for the fiscal year 1996/97 is expected to climb by over 50 percent.</p>

Its parent firm, Megaworld Properties &amp; Holdings Inc said its net income for the first three months was at 419 million pesos from the previous year's 369 million.</p>
<p>* Fil-Estate Land Inc said its net income for the first six months of its fiscal year ending March was at 1,236 million pesos from 908 million a year-ago.</p>

<p>* Basic Petroleum &amp; Minerals Inc said it expects net income for 1997 to reach 108.56 million pesos this year from 7.56 million in 1996 due to its non-oil activities.</p>
<p>* The Philippine Central Bank said that there was no capital flight following the tumble in the local equities market.</p>
<p>* Manila Bulletin says consumers may expect prices of most petroleum products to drop in the next two weeks as prices of Singapore Posted Prices, the benchmark used for monthly oil price adjustments,  continue to post declines.</p>
<p>* Newspaper BusinessWorld said that the energy unit of the Philippine National Oil Co, the PNOC-Energy Development Corp, will start looking for a global coordinator this month to assist in its privatisation efforts.
