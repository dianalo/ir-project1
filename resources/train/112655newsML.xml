<p>Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah on Saturday reappointed Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah as prime minister following parliamentary elections this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Saad al-Abdulla al-Salem al-Sabah, the crown prince, is appointed prime minister and assigned to nominate the members of the new cabinet to us,&quot; a decree issued by Sheikh Jaber said.</p>
<p>Sheikh Saad first became prime minister in February 1978 and has since formed several successive governments.</p>
<p>Born in 1930, the son of Sheikh Abdulla al-Salem al-Sabah, Kuwait's Emir from 1950 to 1965, Sheikh Saad has headed the government through turbulent times at home and abroad.</p>
<p>According to the constitution, the Emir appoints and relieves the prime minister regardless of the results of parliamentary elections. However, by law, at least one deputy should be given a cabinet portfolio.</p>
<p>The current caretaker government headed by Sheikh Saad resigned on Tuesday in line with the constitution, following Monday's parlimentary elections in which pro-government deputies overturned an opposition majority.</p>
<p>The previous 16-man cabinet included five elected MPs.</p>
