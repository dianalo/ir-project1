<text>
<p>Malaysia's benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) was fixed at 9.23 percent at 0300 GMT.</p>
<p>It was at 10.3 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The one-month KLIBOR was fixed at 10.13 percent against 11.3 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The money market was closed on Thursday for a Moslem religious holiday.</p>
<p>KLIBOR is fixed by taking an average of rates offered by various banks in the country.  </p>
<p>Money market dealers said the market remained short of funds though rates were coming off from earlier highs.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still short. There's no sign of Bank Negara in the market this morning,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank. &quot;Rates look like they are holding around these levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank Negara was said to be lending overnight and one-month funds on Wednesday, but only to selected finance and discount houses, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight rate was expected to trade between eight and 10 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>The liquidity squeeze followed heavy buying of the ringgit by the central bank last week to defend the ringgit from a speculative attack.</p>
<p>Although the actual size of the intervention was not known, dealers have estimated that between 2.5 billion and 5.0 billion ringgit was drained from the system.</p>
<p>Dealers said given the continuing pressure on the ringgit, interbank rates were likely to be kept high for the time being.</p>
<p>The ringgit fell to 2.5980/90 to a dollar in Friday morning trade, its weakest level since August 1994.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were slightly higher due to expectations of softening interbank rates.</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up two points to 92.38, or an implied yield of 7.62 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract was unchanged at 92.62, or 7.38 percent.</p>
