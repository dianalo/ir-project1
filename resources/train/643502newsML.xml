<p>Indian blue chips ended with small losses in sluggish trade on Friday, as profit-taking snapped the market's six-day rally, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, we saw speculators offloading long positions,&quot; said Manish Nathwani, dealer at Bombay brokers Samir Doshi. &quot;Quite a lot of stocks had been in overbought zones.&quot;</p>
<p>The market showed a downward trend from opening levels, with heavy selling near the close on the last day of the weekly trade account pulling prices further down, traders said.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark 30-share index ended nearly one percent lower at 3,836.44, off 3,878.99 -- the intra-day high.  </p>
<p>&quot;The reaction was expected to be lower on the last day of end-account trade, but the market showed some strength,&quot; said Kuntal Shah, chief dealer at local brokers D.T. Gandhi.</p>
<p>A market correction was widely anticipated due to profit-taking, but prices could resume an uptrend after a bout of profit-taking, participants said.</p>
<p>Foreign funds were buyers in shares of term-lender Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) which saw a price-limit set on the stock, dealers said.</p>
<p>ICICI rose 4.75 rupees or 6.7 percent to end at 75.50, but off 77.75 -- the day's high in volumes of 1.80 million shares.</p>
