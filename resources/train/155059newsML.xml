<p>China began the trial of prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan on Wednesday on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government, a court official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The trial started at 9.00 a.m. (0100 GMT),&quot; said an official of the Beijing People's Intermediate Court reached by telephone. He declined to give further details.</p>
<p>Security was tight around the court building in western Beijing, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building and manning roadblocks to prevent access.</p>
<p>The father of the former student leader protested his son's innocence just hours before the start of the proceedings and said the family would not give in to the authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;He is definitely innocent,&quot; Wang Xianzeng told reporters as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court. &quot;It just depends on whether the government wants to convict him or not.&quot;</p>
<p>Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not optimistic about the results,&quot; Wang Xianzeng said. &quot;We will definitely appeal... We will not give in.</p>
<p>&quot;Speech can't overthrow the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The court indictment against Wang, 27, includes the charge that his writings in foreign publications were evidence of his plot to try to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>He is also accused of accepting foreign funds, of colluding with subversives living overseas and of conspiring with domestic plotters to organise the overthrow of the government.</p>
<p>Wang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.</p>
<p>The former student leader faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.</p>
<p>The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.</p>
<p>She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.</p>
<p>The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that China's urban dissident movement...has in effect been comprehensively smashed,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wang's court appearance was expected to resemble the in-camera proceedings last December against Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.</p>
<p>Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.</p>
<p>China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.</p>
