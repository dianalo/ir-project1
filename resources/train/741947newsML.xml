<title>USA: Signet branch sale put off pending review.</title>
<headline>Signet branch sale put off pending review.</headline>
<dateline>RICHMOND, Va. 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malcolm McDonald, chairman and chief executive of Signet Banking Corp, told a news conference Monday that 39 Signet branches that were put up for sale in June are now off the market pending a review of Signet's plan to merge with First Union Corp.</p>
<p>The branches are in the area of Roanoke, Va., on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland, and in rural locations.</p>
<p>Executives of Signet and First Union, speaking at the news conference here, also said 105 branches of the two banks are in close proximity to one another and will be reviewed for possible closings.  </p>
<p>&quot;There will be a significant number of branches closed,&quot; McDonald said. &quot;We are working as hard as we can to minimize the impact on people.&quot;</p>
<p>Edward Crutchfield, chairman and chief executive of First Union, estimated that severance costs related to the merger would be &quot;north of $30 million.&quot;</p>
<p>No specific estimate of layoffs was given, but McDonald said there is high turnover through attrition in the branches.</p>
<p>Asked why Signet had agreed to be acquired, McDonald said it was &quot;an opportune time&quot; and &quot;the price was right.&quot;  </p>
<p>Participants in the news conference said the deal was put together in only three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been very sudden, very recent,&quot; McDonald said.</p>
<p>Asked if Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union, the sixth-largest U.S. bank in terms of assets, was responding to two recent acquisitions in Virgina by Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Wachovia Corp, Crutchfield said the answer was &quot;yes and no.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wachovia moves changed the dynamics of the market, he said, and at the same time, First Union was aware that much of Virgina was &quot;a big hole&quot; in its Florida-to-Connecticut system of nearly 2,000 branches.</p>
