<p>Most Australian small businesses believe the economy is either in recession or standing still, according to survey released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of small businesses saw the economy in recession or static, telephone directory publisher Yellow Pages Australia, which conducted the survey, said.</p>
<p>However, Australia has not been in recession for five years.</p>
<p>The survey found that a net 40 percent of small business operators were confident about their business prospects during the next 12 months, compared with 44 percent three months ago and 57 percent a year ago.  </p>
<p>The &quot;net&quot; result was calculated by deducting no responses from the yes responses. The random survey of 1,200 small businesses was conducted across Australia on May 9, four days before the 1997/98 budget and before last Friday's 0.5 percentage point cut in interest rates.</p>
<p>It also found that 20 percent of small businesses believed the national government's policies had a negative impact on them, compared with 14 percent who thought they had a positive impact. However, two-thirds of business proprietors believed the government policies had no impact either way.  </p>
<p>Survey economic adviser John Marsden said that in May a net six percent of small bussinesses saw the government policies as negative, compared with a net 36 percent positive a year before.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a massive loss of support for the government so early in its first term,&quot; Marsden said in a statement.</p>
