<p>The Thai baht is likely to hover near its current level of 28-29 baht to the dollar for the rest of the year, according to a Reuters poll of 13 market analysts in Bangkok and Singapore on Thursday.</p>
<p>The poll, carried out a day after Thailand effectively devalued the baht with a managed float, predicted the currency's six-month outlook would hinge on Thai economic performance as business recovers from this week's shock.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot would depend on post-float economic indicators for July, which should come out in September,&quot; said Charl Kengchon of the Thai Farmers Research Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;Only then can the market see its impact on foreign capital flow and gauge business adjustment to the initial pains,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Of the analysts polled, five predicted that the baht would trade at around 30 baht to the dollar by early 1998, while another four put it in a projected 27-29 baht range.</p>
<p>Only three saw the currency weakening to more than 30 baht to the dollar at the start of 1998.</p>
<p>One Bangkok-based foreign analyst said the currency may fall as low as 35 baht, while a Singapore dealer at the optimistic end of the range made a 25 baht to the dollar forecast.</p>
<p>At 0630 GMT, the baht was quoted at 28.50 to the dollar onshore and 29.50 offshore.</p>
<p>Kengchon warned that in the next few months, the baht may weaken to 30-32 to the dollar as the market would still be influenced by foreign capital flight in May and June.</p>
<p>Apart from corporate foreign exchange losses and more costly imports, Thai businesses could not expect quick relief from lower funding costs because of post-float inflationary pressure, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not see a decline in interest rates for at least three months and can pretty much rule out any clear economic rebound this year,&quot; an analyst at a foreign brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>But he said the Thai economy should see an improved picture from early 1998 that would give room for the central bank to relax monetary policy by cutting domestic interest rates.</p>
<p>The central bank on Wednesday raised its discount rate by two percentage points to 12.50 percent after it floated the baht, partly to curb possible market flight to the dollar.</p>
<p>Chiang Yao Chye, an economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in Singapore, said lower Thai lending rates in the future could revive sluggish exports and improve sentiment on the baht.</p>
<p>&quot;Assuming interest rates are allowed to come down and there is some recovery in the export sector, I think the baht will move to trade around the 29.00 region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thai exports are projected to jump by about seven percent this year after a 0.2 percent fall in 1996.</p>
<p>Vuth Puthamon of Multi-Credit Corp (Thailand) Plc said he did not expect the Thai currency to weaken to more than 30 baht to the dollar in the next six months.</p>
<p>But this was if the government managed to prevent a spate of post-devaluation corporate bankruptcies, keep inflation under control and engineer quick mergers of cash-strapped finance companies.</p>
