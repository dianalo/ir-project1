<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodia king calls for protection of journalists.</title>

<p>King Norodom Sihanouk has appealed to Cambodia's co-premiers to help protect local journalists against violent incidents and threats, according to a letter released on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to send this letter to both prime ministers (Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen) to investigate and take all measures to protect and support Khmer (Cambodian) journalists from danger and to defend a free, multi-party democracy in the Kingdom of Cambodia,&quot; Sihanouk wrote to the co-premiers.</p>
<p>The letter, dated March 22, comes one week after Thomas Hammarberg, special representative of the U.N. Secretary-General for Human Rights in Cambodia, criticised government inaction over nine cases of violence against journalists.</p>
<p>Hammarberg said none of the cases, including the death of four journalists, had been thoroughly investigated and an inquiry to Ranarridh and Hun Sen four months ago had gone unanswered.</p>
<p>In his letter from Beijing, where he is receiving medical treatment, Sihanouk said he was responding to a March 17 letter from Chum Kanal, president of the League of Cambodian Journalists.</p>
<p>Chum Kanal had written to Sihanouk to express concern that armed men were threatening and harming journalists with impunity.</p>
<p>He said his own life was threatened and cited the recent shooting and slight wounding of his son on his way home from Phnom Penh University.</p>
<p>Cambodian newspapers carry biting criticisms of the country's leaders, including the king.</p>
<p>Human rights workers say that particularly strident articles can result in physical intimidation, attacks against journalists and even murder.</p>
