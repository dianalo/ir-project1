<p>Four thousand U.S. soybean and corn growers gathered in Tampa Thursday, and said they were ready to take advantage of new freedoms created by last year's overhaul of agricultural policy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Commodity Classic,&quot; hosted by the National Corn Growers Association and American Soybean Association, is the first major meeting of growers of these two key crops since the &quot;Freedom to Farm&quot; law, which removed almost all federal controls on what farmers can grow.</p>
<p>The changes have sparked uncertainty over plantings. Analysts believe high soybean prices will encourage producers to devote more acreage to soybeans, and corn growers seconded the opinion Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the increase in soybean prices we've seen over the past months are definitely going to take some heat off the corn acreage this year,&quot; said Wallie Hardie, head of the corn group.</p>
<p>The government has projected that this year's soybean acreage will shoot up to 65.3 million acres from last year's 64.2 million acres, the highest since the mid-1980's. Corn acreage is seen rising by 500,000 acres to 81.0 million acres.</p>
<p>Hardie agreed with the government estimate, but his counterpart at the soybean grower group was more cautious on the topic, saying for soybean growers to top last year's acreage would be &quot;pretty significant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We think soybeans will fare pretty well,&quot; said David Erickson, president of the American Soybean Association.</p>
<p>Erickson said he did not think planting decisions would be all price driven, but that farmers would also be looking longer-term at setting up rotations of their crops.</p>
<p>Booming soybean exports and increased demand from domestic processors have sapped inventories and sent prices climbing. An analyst at the Sparks Companies in Memphis recently predicted soybean prices may rise to more than $8 a bushel in the next few months to curb robust demand.</p>
<p>Biotech crops will be a hot topic here over the next two days. U.S. agriculture has greeted the technology as a means to raise yields and use less pesticide but some consumers in the European Union are leery of products made with genetically-modified plants.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position is that when the appropriate government agencies, whether it's here or abroad, approves a product and says it's safe that we should go with it,&quot; said Hardie.</p>
