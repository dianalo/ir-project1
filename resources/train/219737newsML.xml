<p>A Russian air force Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane with 19 people aboard crashed in Siberia on Wednesday night, Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>Interfax said the Emergency Services Ministry in Moscow had confirmed the crash.</p>
<p>Officials at the ministry, who had earlier told Reuters the plane was missing, were not available to confirm the report.</p>
<p>Interfax said rescuers had found wreckage and several bodies 16 km (10 miles) from the airport at Abakan in southern Siberia, where the plane had taken off on a flight to the far eastern Kamchatka peninsula.</p>
<p>The four-engined jet, carrying six crew, 13 passengers and 30 tonnes of commercial freight, left Abakan at 1647 GMT, a ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;They lost contact seven minutes later,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The Il-76, designed as a military tank transporter, is a mainstay of Russia's armed forces and of its commercial fleet.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for military planes to be contracted out for private ventures as servicemen struggle to make ends meet amid Russia's economic crisis.</p>
<p>The Il-76, with its distinctive low-slung fuselage and bulbous glass nose-cone, has become a familiar sight on the world's freight routes since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>A number have been involved in accidents in recent months, including a civilian freighter owned by the Kazakh airline KazAir, which was involved in the world's worst mid-air collision with a Saudi jumbo jet near Delhi on November 12.</p>
<p>Last April, an Il-76 came down on Kamchatka, killing all aboard. One came down near Belgrade in August, killing 10 crewmen and a Ukrainian crew died when their Il-76 crashed on take-off at Kinshasa in June.</p>
<p>A surge in air accidents in Russia in the past few years has been blamed on financial difficulties, which have led to poor maintenance standards and placed extra pressure on crews.</p>
