<title>CANADA: Placer, Crystallex duel over Las Cristinas ownership.</title>
<headline>Placer, Crystallex duel over Las Cristinas ownership.</headline>

<p>Crystallex International Corp. said Monday it has won control of the richest parts of Canadian gold producer Placer Dome Inc.'s Las Cristinas discovery in Venezuela, but Placer vehemently denied the claim.</p>
<p>Crystellex, a small mining company based in Vancouver, said it bought the rights to two blocks of Las Cristinas by acquiring a Venezuelan company whose rights to the property were confirmed by a Venezuelan Supreme Court ruling last year.</p>
<p>Crystallex Vice President Richard Marshall said the Venezuelan Supreme Court in October &quot;ruled by final and binding decision that ownership rights of Cristinas Four and Six were held by the corporation we have just bought.&quot;</p>
<p>The disputed blocks hold a gold resource of about 13 million ounces and the bulk of the entire deposit appears to reside on Block Four, Marshall said. He declined to identify the Venezuelan company or terms of the deal.</p>
<p>Placer vigorously disputed Crystallex's version of events, saying it was completely false. The Venezuelan government recently confirmed Placer's tenure and the same Supreme Court decision upheld the government's awarding of the ground to Placer, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our ownership is secure,&quot; Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said of the Las Cristinas project in the Kilometre 88 area of southeastern Venezuela. Placer aims to begin building a US$576 million gold mine there in May.</p>
<p>Placer holds 70 percent of the project and a Venezuelan state-owned concern the remainder.</p>
<p>The facts surrounding the Las Cristinas dispute were far from clear on Monday and there was widespread confusion among analysts and investors.</p>
<p>But based on the information available so far, analysts said Placer's rights appeared to be solid. &quot;I don't think this will just die, but the onus is on Crystallex to prove its case,&quot; said Goepel Shields analyst Rick Cohen.</p>
<p>Wary after high-profile ownership disputes over other big mineral discoveries, investors turned skittish Monday at the news. Placer shares fell Canadian $1.60 to $27.75 in Toronto before recovering to $28.35. Crystallex stock, meanwhile, climbed $1.70 to $5.85 and then retreated to $4.70.</p>
<p>Disputes over big metal finds at Voisey's Bay in Canada and Busang in Indonesia kept shareholders in the companies involved -- Diamond Fields Resources Inc. and Bre-X Minerals Ltd. -- in suspense for months amid fears that their tenure was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>&quot;None of these issues go away overnight,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst David Christensen. &quot;If this got dragged out over time and into the courts, nobody would like to see that, especially if it delayed the project or raised investor concerns as to ownership.&quot;</p>
<p>Las Cristinas is a key part of Placer's growth strategy and the property is estimated to contain 9 million ounces of gold reserves. Analysts believe it could host up to 20 million ounces of gold.</p>
<p>Marshall said Crystallex held talks with Placer but declined to say if Crystallex was seeking to sell its rights to the disputed blocks to Placer. Crystallex will seek partners to help develop the blocks, he said.</p>
<p>Placer, for its part, said it was not interested in negotiating with Crystallex over its claims.</p>
