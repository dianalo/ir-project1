<p>White sugar futures pushed higher in a light Tuesday session on the back of spot March premium buying and covering of short positions, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some decent party/party trading but people are doing what they have to do and nothing else. There's nothing really outrageous and the volume is quite light,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Arbitrage buyers were drawn into March as the strength of the nearby raws contract caused the premium to narrow.</p>
<p>The scant volume, which totalled 730 lots by 1646 GMT, was boosted by commission house crossed trades. March was up $2.00 at $303.40, with sell-stops in place above $304.00 to cap gains.</p>
<p>May was up $2.10 at $303.00 and other traded positions were also firmer.</p>
<p>Technically, March is nudging towards its 40-day average at $304.00, which also acted as a nearby resistance point when it stood at $304.50 in Friday's session.</p>
<p>Physical brokers said the results of Iraq's tender to buy sugar under the U.N. oil-for-food deal would be slow to emerge as the financing arrangements would demand scrutiny from various parties and the tender restrictions were numerous.</p>
<p>Paris futures also gained ground although only the two nearbys were traded in an overall volume of 385 lots.</p>
<p>March was up $1.20 at $303.30 and May up $1.00 at $303.00.</p>
