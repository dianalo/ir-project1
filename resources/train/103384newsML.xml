<p>The New York Mercantile Exchange's aim to electronically trade its energy and metals futures contracts in Hong Kong from the first quarter of next year will lay the ground for launching a string of new Asian deliverable contracts, NYMEX chairman, Daniel Rappaport said.</p>
<p>&quot;My expectations will be crude oil, gold, silver and copper, but the chances are we will list all the other contracts on ACCESS,&quot; Rappaport said of the exchange's Hong Kong ACCESS trading.</p>
<p>ACCESS is NYMEX's electronic trading system, and the exchange's main tool to further its international ambitions.</p>
<p>&quot;What we would like to do is to work with the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to develop Asian based energy and Asian based metals contracts,&quot; Rappaport added.</p>
<p>NYMEX officials were in London to attend the London Metal Exchange week events. NYMEX's COMEX division copper contracts competes with the LME's flagship copper contract.</p>
<p>Rappaport said COMEX, which he said represented 5 to 20 percent of the world's copper futures market, wanted to regain a 50 percent stake. At present the LME contract dominates.</p>
<p>An Asian deliverable copper contract would require warehouses and Rappaport said the exchange received a very enthusiastic response from Singapore even though the LME already has warehouses for copper there as well.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the LME. They (Asia) were upset with the impact recent events had on pricing of Asian based copper,&quot; Rappaport said refering to the Sumitomo copper scandal which rocked the LME.</p>
<p>NYMEX is negotiating also with SIMEX, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, to install ACCESS trading.</p>
<p>But no Asian deliverable copper contract will be launched until NYMEX is comfortable that its effect will not dilute the New York based contract's pricing role in the United States, Rappaport said.</p>
<p>The vast majority of physcial copper and scrap in the U.S. is priced basis COMEX.</p>
<p>Rappaport said NYMEX and Beijing based regulatory officials have met several times, and he had no regulatory concerns about launching contracts in Hong Kong which reverts to Chinese rule during 1997.</p>
<p>COMEX copper warehouses in Chile were also still a possibility. &quot;Initially we got a lukewarm reaction but following the Sumitomo affair we have received a much warmer reaction,&quot; Rappaport said. No final decision has been made.</p>
<p>&quot;Latin America and Asia are the biggest growth potential for metals and energy,&quot; Rappaport said.</p>
<p>NYMEX said it would also launch an aluminium contract once Congress amends the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act. Three bills were presented before Congress went into pre-election recess. Rappaport was confident Congress will pass a bill to come into effect probably by the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Amendments to the Act would bring foreign exchanges with physically delivered contracts in the U.S., such as the LME, under CFTC's regulatory umbrella. Rappaport said this would make it easier to compete with LME in new contracts and &quot;stabilise&quot; the COMEX copper contract.</p>
<p>A NYMEX aluminum contract, whose launch would be speeded up once regulatory reform was passed, will be deliverable in Mississippi. The U.S. was the world's biggest producer and consumer of aluminum, Rappaport noted.</p>
