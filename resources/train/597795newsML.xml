<p>Election-related violence hit Indonesia on Tuesday as a riot broke out during campaigning in central Java and troops fired into the air in Jakarta to disperse thousands of supporters of a Moslem-backed minority party.</p>
<p>Witnesses said up to ten thousand supporters of the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) attacked an office of the ruling Golkar party in the central Java town of Pekalongan, about 260 miles (415 km) east of Jakarta.</p>
<p>One man was wounded by a gunshot, they said.</p>
<p>The office, which belongs to the youth wing of Golkar, was pelted with stones and ransacked before police fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse the mob, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Four motorcycles and many Golkar flags were burnt by the crowd and two houses near the Golkar office were damaged, they said. Five people were injured by stone-throwing and about a score were held by police.</p>
<p>Earlier, police and troops fired warning shots and dozens of tear gas canisters to disperse thousands of PPP supporters who swamped several areas of Jakarta, hurling stones and chanting slogans.</p>
<p>Hundreds of troops and police dispersed a crowd of youths in the Warung Buncit area in the south of the city who were burning tires and blocking traffic.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the security forces used water cannons and charged the crowd after they threw stones, chasing them into side alleys and beating those they caught with rattan sticks.</p>
<p>Helicopters circled the area, calling on people to disperse, and office workers were trapped until after dark when a late monsoon shower cooled political passions.</p>
<p>Jakarta military chief Major-General Sutiyoso said on television after touring violence-hit areas of the capital that troops would maintain order for the rest of the campaign, which ends on Friday ahead of the voting on May 29.</p>
<p>In the Otista area in the east of the city, police broke up a street battle between PPP and Golkar backers. Another battle between rivals was dispersed later in the Cawang district.</p>
<p>Reuters cameramen saw a man in plain clothes firing several shots from a pistol in the direction of demonstrators in the Otista district, but it was not clear if he was using live ammunition and there were no reports of casualties.</p>
<p>Jakarta police chief Major-General Hamani Nata said at least 20 people were arrested after the violence.</p>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah softened slightly on reports of the violence, easing about three points from the opening to 2,444 against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The stock market ended flat, easing back from earlier gains. But the index still closed up 0.28 points at 652.83 points.</p>
<p>Violence flared despite a decision by PPP leaders not to campaign in Jakarta on Tuesday after street battles between its supporters and Golkar rivals last weekend. Golkar is due to campaign on Java on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The leaders of the PPP, Golkar and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) said on Sunday night they were calling off mass rallies until the end of the election campaign on Friday to avert further violence.</p>
<p>But observers said it was clear that they had little control over their supporters.</p>
<p>Despite the tensions, political analysts have said Golkar is tipped to easily win the elections for 425 seats in parliament. The rest of the seats in the 500-member house are reserved for the military, which does not vote.</p>
