<headline>U.S. says probe into Saudi bomb attack going well.</headline>

<p>U.S. Deputy Defence Secretary John White said on Monday he was satisfied with the progress of investigations into a June bombing that killed 19 American airmen near Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have quite close cooperation with the Saudi government in respect to the Dhahran blast investigations and we think it is going very well,&quot; he told reporters before leaving Doha after a brief visit.</p>
<p>The servicemen were killed when a fuel truck blew up at a complex housing U.S. military personnel in the city of Khobar, near Dhahran. Saudi Arabia has yet to reveal the results of its investigation into the blast.</p>
<p>In November 1995, seven people including five Americans were killed in a bombing at a U.S.-run military training centre in Riyadh. Four Saudis were beheaded for carrying out the attack.</p>
<p>Washington has repeatedly said Saudi authorities had not yet provided evidence the United States wants in its investigation of the Khobar bombing. In January FBI Director Louis Freeh criticised the kingdom for frustrating U.S. efforts to determine responsbility for the attack.</p>
<p>White, who visited Saudi Arabia on Sunday, said he discussed the progress of investigations with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the Saudis) are continuing with the investigations and we are cooperating with them and I think should not comment on it. But obviously from their point of view and our point of view the people who perpetrated this act of terrorism should be brought to justice soon,&quot; White said.</p>
<p>About 5,700 U.S. troops are stationed in the kingdom as part of coalition forces policing a no-fly zone over southern Iraq.</p>
<p>White, who left Qatar for Bahrain as part of a tour of the region, said U.S. policy towards the Gulf would remain unchanged, despite a change of the guard at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>During his visit, White met with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani and inspected operations of the U.S. Airpower Expeditionary Force's 30 planes, deployed in Qatar until May 20 to fly sorties in support of Operation Southern watch over Iraq.</p>
