<p>Former security chief and would-be president Alexander Lebed said on Saturday he believed he had only one serious rival for Russia's top job -- Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov.</p>
<p>Both Lebed, a popular reserve general sacked by President Boris Yeltsin last autumn for being too ambitious, and Luzhkov are seen as strong candidates in the next presidential contest, due in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Lebed told Interfax news agency that he did not see newly-promoted reformer Boris Nemtsov as a significant contender for the presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very well disposed to B. Nemtsov but am sure that he will not be able to build himself up for the elections,&quot; it quoted Lebed as saying.</p>
<p>The boyish, telegenic Nemtsov, 37, has become a key player in Yeltsin's team since a cabinet shake-up in March put pro-market liberals in overall charge of economic policy.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, seen by Yeltsin himself as a possible successor, is now a first deputy prime minister responsible for reforming Russia's cumbersome natural monopolies -- gas, electricity, railways and telecommunications -- and is also in charge of the energy sector.</p>
<p>Nemtsov himself has described his new responsibilities as something of a poisoned chalice as they will force him to take on powerful vested interests.</p>
<p>&quot;Nemtsov is constantly getting framed and now he has nobody to rely on in the government,&quot; Lebed told Interfax.</p>
<p>But a poll carried by Interfax on Saturday seemed to contradict Lebed's assessment of Nemtsov's chances.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted in mid-April among 1,500 people, showed Russians believed honesty and decency were the most important qualities of a president and that Nemtsov was the public figure most widely seen as possessing them.</p>
<p>Lebed ranked highest in the poll for strength of character and ability to take a matter to its conclusion, and Luzhkov was seen as the politician with the best organisational experience.</p>
<p>But Interfax said the survey also showed Russians believed none of their politicians knew where to lead the country.</p>
