<headline>INTERVIEW - Ube eyes new magnesium technology.</headline>

<p>TOKYO, June 26, Reuter - Ube Industries Ltd, a manufacturer of chemicals and machinery, is eyeing a new technology that might persuade Japan's car and electronics industry to boost the use of magnesium.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we are all (the industry) looking at the technology of thixo-moulding, though it's still uncertain how good it is,&quot; Tameyo Miki, general manager of Ube's light metal sales department, told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This technology might help the industry overcome one of the hurdles hindering the use of magnesium in this country.&quot;</p>
<p>Thixo-moulding, a possible alternative to diecasting, allows magnesium to be shaped without using strong heat to melt the metal, which is easily oxidised and set on fire.</p>
<p>In addition to its high price, difficulties involved in handling the metal, which is also used in fireworks to produce white-coloured sparks, are one of the major reasons behind the Japanese industry's reluctance to expand its use, Miki said.</p>
<p>Magnesium, lighter than aluminium but about twice as expensive, can be used to make lightweight components for cars.</p>
<p>Miki said the thixo-moulding technology, which was originally developed in the United States, could dramatically boost magnesium usage in Japan.</p>
<p>Data compiled by Toyota Motor Corp shows Japanese cars contain about 0.25 kg of magnesium each, compared to more than 1.5 kg in the U.S.</p>
<p>Japan's automobile industry is lagging far behind overseas counterparts in terms of magnesium usage. General Motors, Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG, have all invested in magnesium-production projects to secure a source of long-term supplies at the best price.</p>
<p>Official data shows that diecast magnesium, used mainly by the car industry, accounts for less than 10 percent of Japan's total magnesium demand of some 30,000 tonnes a year.</p>
<p>However Ube Industries, which launched a $8 million magnesium project in China after Japan stopped producing the metal in 1995, is confident the tide will change.</p>
<p>Full production at Ube's 4,000 tonne-per-year plant in China started this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese carmakers are about to review their policy (on magnesium),&quot; Miki said. &quot;Once the car industry does decide to go ahead with magnesium, the amount at stake is large.&quot;</p>
<p>Interest in the metal is also growing among makers of home electronics as magnesium is easy to recycle and shields electro-magnetic waves, he said.</p>
<p>Resin processors in particular are examining thixo-moulding technology carefully as electronics companies, such as Sony Corp, have already started using magnesium in cases for video cameras, mobile telephones, portable music systems and lap-top computers, he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether Ube was considering a second plant in China, Miki said: &quot;In the long term, there will be insufficient production, especially of magnesium alloy. At one point, we have to start thinking about it.&quot;</p>
