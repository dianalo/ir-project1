<title>USA: Retired KGB agent downplays role of Rosenbergs.</title>
<headline>Retired KGB agent downplays role of Rosenbergs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>A retired KGB agent who had the most direct contact between Moscow and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, executed in 1953 for espionage, says the couple did not provide Russia with any useful material about the atomic bomb, two major U.S. newspapers reported in Sunday editions.</p>
<p>In an interview at his Moscow apartment on Saturday, Alexander Feklisov, 86, told the New York Times the Rosenbergs were executed unjustly. &quot;He didn't understand anything about the atomic bomb and he couldn't help us. And still they killed them. It was a contract murder,&quot; Feklisov is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>However, Julius Rosenberg did give away military secrets, the agent told the Times and the Washington Post in separate interviews, both published on Sunday.</p>
<p>Feklisov is known in the United States for his behind-the-scenes role as an intermediary between the KGB and the White House during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.</p>
<p>The Times said his declining health and his strong loyalty to Rosenberg prompted him to speak out about what happened 47 years ago. He told the newspaper he did not have permission from the KGB's successor, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, to tell his side of the story.</p>
<p>The Times said a spokesman in Moscow for their Foreign Intelligence Service would not comment on the Rosenberg's or about what Feklisov had to say about them.</p>
<p>The former agent met with Rosenberg about 50 times between 1943 and 1946, the Post reported. He was also quoted as saying the execution of Ethel Rosenberg was unfair since she had not actively spied herself.</p>
<p>&quot;She had nothing to do with this -- she was completely innocent. I think she knew, but for that you don't kill people,&quot; Feklisov told the Times.</p>
<p>The Rosenbergs were convicted mainly on the testimony of Ethel Rosenberg's brother, David Greenglass, and his wife Ruth who were arrested for conspiracy and confessed. Greenglass was a low-level worker at the Los Alamos, N.M., atom bomb project.</p>
<p>Feklisov also calls former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev &quot;a silly man&quot; who &quot;didn't understand anything&quot; for writing in his memoirs that the Rosenberg's &quot;provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb.&quot;</p>
<p>In the article, Feklisov said Rosenberg gave him a rough sketch of a &quot;lens mould,&quot; a bomb part he got from his brother-in-law that the former KGB agent insisted was useless. &quot;He gave us a childish scribble -- it was meaningless,&quot; he told the Times.</p>
<p>The Discovery Channel will air a documentary film about the Rosenberg case, quoting Feklisov next Sunday, the Post said.</p>
<p>The Post said the Rosenberg children, Michael and Robert Meeropol, declined an invitation to meet with Feklisov during a two-week visit to the United States last September.</p>
<p>Michael Meeropol told the paper the family was reserving judgment on the Russian's statements until after the screening of the television documentary.</p>
