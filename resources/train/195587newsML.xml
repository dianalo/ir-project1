<p>The troubled Miss World beauty contest in India has brought Miss Israel and Miss Lebanon together, but not in the same picture, the Israeli contestant told Reuters in Bangalore on Sunday.</p>
<p>The two women are the only Middle East representatives among 88 women from all over the world who have gathered in this southern Indian city to compete for the Miss World title.</p>
<p>&quot;She (Miss Lebanon) does not want to be photographed with me because it would lead to problems for her back in Lebanon,&quot; said Israel's Miss World contestant Talia Leventhal.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no problems being seen with her, but she has a problem,&quot; Leventhal said, adding that the two of them might have spoken more, but for a language barrier.</p>
<p>Miss Lebanon, Nisrine Nasr, was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Leventhal, a 1.8 metre (5ft 10in) professional model says she will join the Israeli army, but not because she has to.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a choice, but I would like to go through the training just like any other woman in Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>Leventhal did not want to comment on latest clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;We all want peace. I am sure our prime minister will do his best,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Asked if as the only Middle East women in Bangalore she and Miss Lebanon were sharing a room Leventhal burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the organisers will allow that,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The pageant has been dogged by controversy and members of a militant Indian womens' group have threatened to wreck the show's finale on November 23 by staging suicide protests.</p>
<p>A 25-year old man killed himself by self-immolation on Thursday in Madurai, some 432 kilometres (270 miles) away from Bangalore in a protest against the show.</p>
