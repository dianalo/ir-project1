<p>Recent skirmishes between a major rebel group and Burmese troops may start to unravel ceasefire deals between Rangoon and more than a dozen ethnic rebel armies, diplomatic, Thai and rebel sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>At least 100 ethnic Wa and Burmese fighters have been killed over the past few months in skirmishes between the guerrillas of the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and government troops in northeastern Burma, Thai and Wa sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The UWSA was one of the first and regarded as the strongest among the 15 ethnic rebel groups that reached loosely-formed ceasefire accords with Burma's State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) after the junta seized power in 1988.</p>
<p>Rangoon-based diplomats said if the Wa and other rebel groups decided to resume fighting it could spark wider unrest in the country among democracy supporters, peasants and students.</p>
<p>The Wa, former headhunters who were the rank and file of the Communist Party of Burma's military wing, mutinied against their communist leaders in 1989 and agreed to a ceasefire with SLORC in exchange for autonomy in their Shan state strongholds.</p>
<p>But recently the UWSA has clashed with Burmese troops in the eastern region of the country, sources on the border said.</p>
<p>&quot;The UWSA defied the Burmese demand to withdraw from Doi Lang and other jungle bases that used to belong to Khun Sa and fighting has resumed,&quot; a Thai security source who monitors the border situation told Reuters.</p>
<p>Doi Lang was a stronghold of Khun Sa, the opium warlord who surrendered to Burmese troops last year.</p>
<p>The source cited field reports that at least 100 people from both sides had been killed during skirmishes in Burma's Mong Yon, Mong Kok and Doi Lang areas over the past few months.</p>
<p>The UWSA, which used to support Burma in its military operations against the Wa's arch rival, Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA), sent guerrillas to occupy former MTA bases after Khun Sa surrendered.</p>
<p>Thai and Western anti-narcotics agents say the Wa were the strongest rival to the MTA for heroin production in Burma -- the world's largest source of opium and heroin.</p>
<p>Veteran UWSA commander Maha Hsang said although there had been no serious fighting, minor altercations continued and full-blown attacks could resume.</p>
<p>&quot;The fighting was halted after the SLORC stopped talking about our withdrawing from Doi Lang,&quot; Maha Hsang told Reuters in a telephone interview from the border.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the fact that all parties have halted major military operations I think fighting will resume sooner or later. Everyone is sitting on a time bomb,&quot; Haha Hsang said.</p>
<p>He said mistrust between the rebels and the SLORC still prevailed, so he doubted the UWSA members would fulfill the SLORC's demand to hand over their weapons by 1999.</p>
<p>Diplomats and analysts in Rangoon have said a major problem for the SLORC in the coming months is how to deal with ethnic insurgency -- a problem that has plagued Burma for decades.</p>
<p>The SLORC's main headache in recent years has been the democracy movement of Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy was barred from taking power after winning a general election in 1990.</p>
<p>The 15 ethnic groups that have signed ceasefire deals with SLORC still have weapons and control their respective areas.</p>
<p>The Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), another major rebel faction that signed a deal with the SLORC, is said to be ready to resume fighting against the SLORC, rebel sources said.</p>
<p>The KIO sent a representative to a gathering of the National Democratic Front (NDF) -- a newly revived rebel organisation which fought Burma's military rulers in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>KIO officials were not available but participants at last month's NDF meeting said the KIO had common views with UWSA.</p>
<p>&quot;The KIO also predicted that fighting will resume. Nobody trusts the Burmese so they have decided to hold on to their weapons,&quot; Khun Kyaw Oo, who represented the Shan United Revolution Army (SURA) at the seminar, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Karen National Union (KNU) -- the only major rebel group yet to sign a ceasefire deal with the SLORC -- is still waging a war against Rangoon and has headed up the NDF efforts for a coordinated attack against the rebels.</p>
