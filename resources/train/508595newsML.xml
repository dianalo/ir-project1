<p>Moscow would cut gas supplies to Moldova if it does not start paying its debt to Russian gas monopoly Gazprom, a Russian minister said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A protocol, signed by Aman Tuleyev, Russia's minister in charge of cooperation with former Soviet republics, and Moldovan officials, said that if Moldova did not start paying its $570 million debt to Gazprom in one month, the monopoly would cut supplies by the sum of the unpaid debt.</p>
<p>&quot;The mechanism is very tough, and when the gas supplies are cut, one begins to think quickly how to pay for it&quot;, Tuleyev told a news conference in the Moldovan capital of Chisinau after two days of talks with Moldovan officials.</p>
<p>Moldova buys three billion cubic metres of natural gas from Gazprom every year at a price of $58 per 1,000 cubic metres.</p>
<p>Part of the overall debt -- $300 million -- is owed by the Moldovan breakaway Dnestr region. Separatist authorities have to present by April 24 their own timetable of repaying the debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither Moldova nor the Dnestr have cash to pay for the debt. We looked for a mechanism which would satisfy both sides. I may come again, we could kiss and embrace each other and drink a lot of wine, but the debts must be returned&quot;, Tuleyev said.</p>
<p>Moldova will pass $140 million worth of state bonds to Gazprom in May, according to an agreement signed with Gazprom last year and approved by Moldova's parliament.</p>
<p>Moldova plans to pay the rest of the debt with cash and goods supplies by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Russia proposed Moldova corporatise its biggest Cuciurgan electric power station, on the territory of the Dnestr. Fifty percent of the shares should be passed to Russian power utility Unified Energy System (UES), Russia has said.</p>
<p>The 2,520-megawatt-capacity Cuciurgan station produces up to 86 percent of Moldova's total energy. Moldova's energy output dropped to 6.1 million kwt in 1996 from 15.5 million in 1990.</p>
<p>Tuleyev said Russia could restore the station to full capacity in two years, allowing Moldova not only to stop importing two billion kwt of electricity a year from Ukraine, but to export up to four billion kwt a year to the Balkans.</p>
<p>But Moldova's deputy prime minister Valeriu Bulgari cast some doubt over the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not true that Moldova is paying for the debt by its capital. It is only an idea, which has to be worked upon&quot;, Bulgari said.</p>
<p>Tuleyev was quick to comment: &quot;It is Russia's official offer. When the people remain without gas, their head starts to work fast.&quot;</p>
<p>The minister said the 1996 trade turnover between Russia and Moldova was $1.1 billion, 14 percent up from 1995. Moldova's figures show that Russia's share in Moldovan foreign trade amounts to about 40 percent.</p>
<p>Tuleyev, a rare minister in the Russian government who belongs to the opposition, said he believed the two countries could increase trade by another 26-27 percent in 1997 and reach the $2.5 billion annual level by 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;But we have to decide how to proceed with Ukraine&quot;, said Tuleyev, referring to Ukraine's decision earlier this month to charge a transit tax for transportation through Ukraine's territory. The move blocked much of Moldova's exports to Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do not resolve that problem, it is difficult to expect any trade growth&quot;, Tuleyev said.</p>
<p>Russia agreed to grant 150 billion roubles credit to Moldova for a five-year period under Libor plus 1 percent interest rate.</p>
<p>The credit is taken out of the total 2.7 trillion roubles fund allocated by the Russia's 1997 budget for investing in the CIS countries.</p>
<p>Once the credit is approved, Moldova would have to purchase trolley buses, combine-harvesters, energy plant machinery and other goods from Russia.</p>
