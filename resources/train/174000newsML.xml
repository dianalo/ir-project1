<p>Popular rock group Porno For Pyros have scrapped their current tour to allow their guitarist to receive treatment for cancer, the band's label said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Peter Distephano will undergo chemotherapy and doctors were optimistic he would recover fully, a statement from Warner Bros. Records said. It did not reveal what form of cancer he had, but noted it was diagnosed early.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter remains in good spirits and is looking forward to resuming the band's touring schedule,&quot; the label said.</p>
<p>Porno For Pyros, led by Lollapalooza co-founder and former Jane's Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell, have been touring in support of their second album, &quot;Good God's Urge.&quot;</p>
<p>The group has postponed eight concerts in the western U.S. as well as dates in Mexico City, Santiago, Buenos Aires, Rio De Janeiro and Sao Paulo.</p>
