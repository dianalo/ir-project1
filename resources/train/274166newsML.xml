<p>Philippines President Fidel Ramos successfully underwent surgery on Monday, a day after suddenly being taken ill, and was recovering well, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Ramos is awake, he's smiling, he's listening to radio,&quot; Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters. &quot;The operation was extremely successful.&quot;</p>
<p>Senate President Ernesto Maceda said in a statement that Ramos was to have undergone cardiovascular surgery but other officials refused to give details of the operation.</p>
<p>Executive Secretary Ruben Torres told reporters after a cabinet meeting at the presidential palace that the surgery, which began at 7 a.m. (2300 GMT Sunday), lasted about 90 minutes and that Ramos was recuperating.</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said the surgery was successful and the president was in &quot;super&quot; condition.</p>
<p>Ramos, 68, was admitted to hospital for the second time in 10 days on Sunday, and doctors initially said he was to undergo follow-up checks following his confinement to bed the previous weekend for a throat infection.</p>
<p>But television reports late on Sunday said doctors suspected a blockage in an artery and were preparing for an angiography test.</p>
<p>News of Ramos being admitted to hospital hit the local stock market hard on Monday. The Philippine Composite Index was down 1.92 percent at 3,119.28 points at mid-morning. while the peso was slightly weaker at 26.310/316 against the dollar from 26.301 on Friday.</p>
<p>Ramos had set off alarm bells on Manila's bourse and corporate boardrooms when he was admitted to the hospital on December 12 and some newspapers reported he had suffered a mild stroke.</p>
<p>He was released three days later after being treated for what doctors said was a throat infection.</p>
<p>Ramos resumed a heavy schedule of speaking engagements and other public appearances shortly after he checked out, apparently to scotch the rumours of serious ill-health.</p>
<p>Doctors urged him to slow down and Ramos cancelled a series of provincial trips.</p>
<p>He told his weekly news conference on Wednesday he was in good health and that jitters in the stock market over his health appeared to be over.</p>
<p>Ramos's hospital spells coincided with a controversy over calls by a citizens' group to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re-election when his six-year term ends in June 1998. The constitution limits a president to a single term.</p>
