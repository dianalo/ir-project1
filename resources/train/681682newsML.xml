<headline>FOCUS-Thai decrees to boost short-term sentiment.</headline>

<p>Thailand, hit by its worst economic crisis in several decades, plans to issue decrees outlining urgent measures to revamp the troubled finance sector and stamp out speculation in the embattled baht.</p>
<p>Government officials said on Monday the cabinet was expected to issue special royal decrees on guidelines for merging cash-strapped finance firms and on government roles in refinancing property loans extended by financial institutions.</p>
<p>Analysts said this could lift short-term market sentiment, but in the longer run there were question-marks, particularly over mergers.</p>
<p>&quot;No one would dispute that the government needs to do something to shore up the finance sector but whether the decrees can induce quick mergers of these firms is another matter,&quot; said Kavee Chukijkasem, of Capital Nomura Securities Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;It would give a brief psychological lift but any actual merger success would hinge on what synergy or business benefits the future allied companies get,&quot; Kavee said.</p>
<p>The proposed decrees to be considered by the cabinet on Tuesday include new laws on securitisation and a secondary mortgage corporation through which the state-run Government Savings Bank would buy property loans and assets from finance firms facing cashflow problems and resell them as securities.</p>
<p>Government officials said the decrees would probably include clearer guidelines on Thailand's recent moves to control offshore supply of its baht and curb market attacks on its currency.</p>
<p>Thailand's 91 finance firms have faced a severe liquidity crunch arising from high non-performing loans, shaky confidence in their stability, and prolonged high financing costs in the Thai money market.</p>
<p>Finance firms have paid an average of more than 20 percent interest rate for their short-term funding for several months with no quick relief in sight. The central bank has asked finance companies to cut deposit rates, the Thai Finance Companies Association said on Monday.</p>
<p>Most finance and securities companies suffered heavy first quarter losses and their positions are expected to worsen -- or stay the same -- for the rest of 1997, due to a prolonged slump of the Thai stock market which has lost about 60 percent of its value in the past year.</p>
<p>Analysts said central bank officials, in a move to expedite mergers among small finance firms, last month floated a warning that the Bank of Thailand may leave uncooperative companies to fold.</p>
<p>They said actual finance corporate mergers would be time-consuming as negotiations and corporate asset assessment need at least 100-150 days to be concluded.</p>
<p>&quot;Medium or small finance firms would have no synergy to gain and few incentives to merge. The finance sector probably has only about five strong companies viewed as good merger leaders but they would likely ask the government to take care of the non-performing loans of small firms being taken in,&quot; an industry analyst said.</p>
<p>The analyst said with sufficient incentives including new bank licenses, each of the five big finance companies could merge with six to seven smaller ones. This scenario would trim the sector down to 55-60 companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has nothing to lose by issuing the decrees but whether they will work or not depends on details in them,&quot; he said.</p>
