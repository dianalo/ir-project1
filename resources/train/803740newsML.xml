<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates firmer on tight liquidity.</title>
<headline>KL interbank rates firmer on tight liquidity.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-08-15</dateline>

<p>Malaysian interbank rates were firmer on Friday morning as the market remained short of funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market was getting tight again as funds which banks borrowed from the central bank in July were starting to mature and leave the system.</p>
<p>Bank Negara has been lending funds, mostly one-month money, over the past month to help ease market tightness and bring interbank rates down.</p>
<p>Dealers said a large local bank, which is also an agent of the central bank, was seen lending one-month money this morning.</p>
<p>&quot;But the bank could be lending its own money and not on behalf of Negara,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>At 0315 GMT, one-month money was at 7.30/35 percent against 7.20 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>Three-month money was at 7.45/50 percent from 7.40/50 percent, while the one-week rate was at 5.9/6.0 percent against 6.1 percent.</p>
<p>Interbank rates had softened on Thursday on rumours, later denied, of a cut in banks' statutory reserve requirement (SRR).</p>
<p>A recent tightening of market liquidity following a massive intervention by the central bank in the foreign exchange market to defend the ringgit from speculative attack, had prompted speculation that the SRR would be trimmed from its current 13.5 percent level.</p>
<p>The SRR, deposits that banks keep interest-free with the central bank, has been raised by two percentage points since the beginning of 1996.</p>
<p>Dealers said a one percentage point cut in the SRR would free up about three billion ringgit.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were mixed to reflect uncertainty over the direction of interbank rates.</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up one point to 92.51, or an implied yield of 7.49 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract was unchnaged at 92.65, or 7.35 percent while March 1998 contract was down two to 92.70, or 7.30 percent.</p>
