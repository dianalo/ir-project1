<headline>LIFFE white sugar holds support but trading light.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-10</dateline>

<p>London's August white sugar contract hovered precariously above nearby $325 support in light Tuesday activity defying downward pressure wrought by a mixed bag of sellers, traders said.</p>
<p>French brokerages were cited among the sellers coupled with some commission house dealings. But traders complained that the market's pace was sluggish and little real movement was expected before the New York open.</p>
<p>At 1145 GMT August was down 50 cents at $325.60 and October down 10 cents at $316.50. Volume was 258 lots, nearly all of which was in the spot month.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said while the market had been weaker this week, prices might have already corrected enough after the recent fund-inspired rally to gather enough pace for another push higher.</p>
<p>&quot;London whites were overdue a correction and now that we have had one we are inclined to view the next move as higher,&quot; said Darren Gurner, an analyst at Sucden.</p>
<p>He placed August support at $325 and $322, with resistance at the $330.80 high notched up on June 3.</p>
<p>Fresh physical news included Bangladesh's purchase of 25,000 tonnes of white sugar at $338.75 per tonne for June/July shipment from a Saudi firm.</p>
<p>Iraq was reported to have bought 12,500 tonnes of Brazilian white sugar at $379 per tonne C&amp;F as part of the U.N.-sposored oil-for-food programme.</p>
<p>Just six lots of August were traded on the Paris market, with the position down 50 cents at $325.50.</p>
