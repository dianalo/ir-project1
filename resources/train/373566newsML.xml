<p>European currency union would give a strong boost to Germany's economy, lifting GDP by 0.2 percent or eight billion marks by 2000 annually and by 2.5 percent or 100 billion marks by 2005, a German bank said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, the German economy could expect growth to slow significantly in the run-up to the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), targeted for 1999, the Bavarian bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank, said in a study.</p>
<p>Budgetary measures needed to meet criteria for EMU membership set out in the Maastricht Treaty, combined with deficit-reducing measures which would be necessary in any case, would lower growth levels by 0.7 percent in 1997, it said.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Vereinsbank went on to forecast GDP growth of 1.5 percent this year.</p>
<p>The chief positive effect of currency union would be the eradication of insecurity about exchange rate volatility, which would in turn lead to lower investment risk, as well as the disappearance of exchange rate transaction costs.</p>
<p>Currency union would also give an extra fillip to growth through an increase in capital stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;The European capital markets will become more liquid, in many areas they will become deeper, and as far as instruments are concerned, they will become more diverse,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Post-EMU, the European bond market would be the second-biggest in the world after the United States, ahead of Japan, and therefore less reliant on U.S. interest rate movements.</p>
<p>As well as this, the financial infrastructure would become more efficient. These benefits would all combine to maintain a low interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Performance pressures in the financial sector would filter through to the overall economy, where principles of shareholder value, similar to those in the United States, would play a bigger role in Germany in future.</p>
<p>&quot;This will have an impact on the employment market in Germany. The pressure on wages will grow at the same rate as the pressure to reform institutions,&quot; Vereinsbank said.</p>
<p>&quot;The euro will not only make it clear to the Portuguese worker exactly what one can earn in Germany, but will also show German employers and employees the hourly rate in Portugal. The growth in real wages will certainly fall,&quot; said the report.</p>
