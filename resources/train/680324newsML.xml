<p>Poland's Finance Minister Marek Belka asked on Monday for patience to allow monetary and fiscal measures to bring down the country's current account deficit and burgeoning domestic demand.</p>
<p>The minister rejected any suggestion that Poland might accelerate the pace of its currency devaluation to address the demand imbalance.</p>
<p>&quot;Our economic policy is oriented toward slowing down the growth of domestic demand,&quot; Belka told U.S. investors gathered here at a road show for Poland's inaugural yankee bond.  </p>
<p>The minister said the National Bank of Poland had raised interest rates to dampen domestic demand, but that these measures needed time to achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p>&quot;You should have some faith in monetary policy and some patience,&quot; Belka said.</p>
<p>Last week, National Bank of Poland president Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said the central bank might raise interest rates further if excessive credit growth continued.</p>
<p>Last week, the central bank reported that the current account deficit grew to $2.27 billion in the first four months of 1997 from a $226 million gap for the same period last year.  </p>
<p>Belka said that Poland's current account deficit had stabilized on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but that Poland had concentrated both fiscal and monetary policy toward its deceleration.</p>
<p>&quot;We clearly are concerned, even if we think that this year there is no danger at all,&quot; Belka said. &quot;If it's left complacently, it can explode.&quot;</p>
<p>The government would not speed up the pace of its program of currency devaluation, which decreases the zloty at one percentage point per month, Belka said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are not considering a faster devaluation, on the contrary we are aware this rate of devaluation is probably excessive,&quot; Belka said.</p>
<p>Given that inflation had dropped to 0.4-0.6 pct per month, the government could reduce its zloty devaluation rate but held off because of the growth of demand, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of our concerns about the current account deficit, we are still keeping the 1.0 percent a month devaluation even if it may slows down the disinflation process,&quot; Belka said.  </p>
<p>Belka also said next year's budget would be much more restrictive to address the demand problem.</p>
<p>Poland's economic team had travelled to New York to present its upcoming yankee bond to U.S. investors, a $300 million seven year issue via JP Morgan that is expected to price this week.</p>
<p>Wieslaw Szczuka, director of the foreign department of Poland's Finance Ministry, said the yankee issue could grow as high as $400 million, depending on market conditions. He added the government would seek approval from Congress to issue some $500 million in foreign bond issuance in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue the policy of being very modest in bond borrowing in foreign markets,&quot; Szczuka said. &quot;There is no need to borrow heavily.&quot;</p>
