<p>Ethiopia said on Monday that it had vast proven deposits of iron and nickel which could be developed through the participation of mainly foreign investors.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Energy and Mines said results of exploration carried out by a joint team of Ethiopians and Koreans identified the existence of 58 million tonnes of iron reserves and 10.5 million tonnes of nickel in the west and south of the country.</p>
<p>In a statement that announced the results, the ministry did not give an estimate of what the reserves were worth.</p>
<p>The government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi opened Ethiopia's mining sector to private investment in 1993.</p>
<p>At the time, the government issued mining proclamations and regulations that gave foreign investors incentives such as duty free imports of equipment and repatriation of profits.</p>
<p>The government also cut mining income tax to 35 percent from 45 percent and the Ethiopian government's free equity stake was reduced to two percent from a ceiling of 10 percent.</p>
<p>Since then, explorations have gathered pace and 12 foreign companies have signed agreements for the exploration of gold and base metals, gemstones and petroleum across Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Companies from Canada, the United States, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Ghana have signed gold exploration agreements with Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Italian and American concerns have also signed rights for the exploration of gemstone and petroleum, ministry documents showed.</p>
<p>The ministry said that the study also showed the existence of 3.4 million tonnes of sheet glass raw material in the central and southern parts and a reserve of more than 85 million tonnes of diatomite and 170 million tonnes of bentonite in the Rift Valley.</p>
<p>Ethiopia's rulers have turned to mining as a major future alternative source of hard currency earnings now dominated by coffee.</p>
