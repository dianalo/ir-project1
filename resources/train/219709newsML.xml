<p>Zimbabwe's agriculture-based economy is on track for a five percent growth rate in 1997 following two weeks of heavy rains, economic analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The southern African state's gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown by about five percent this year after 40 percent growth in agriculture that included a quadrupling of the staple maize crop to 2.8 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Its GDP shrank by over two percent in 1995 when the country was hit by a severe drought which cut agriculture output by about 12 percent.</p>
<p>The new 1996/97 November-April cropping season has so far enjoyed heavy rains, and farming associations -- pegging their estimates on current forecast of a near-normal rain -- expect national output to be higher or equal to last year's.</p>
<p>&quot;So far agriculture is looking good and (GDP) growth can reach seven percent if the government helps the manufacturing sector to recover its viability,&quot; said economic consultant John Robertson.</p>
<p>&quot;The government does not seem to be doing that...and I think a lot of people are justified in being angry that such urgent issues are taking forever to resolve,&quot; he told Reuters, refering to a long-standing plan by President Robert Mugabe's government to introduce a new tariff regime and incentives to protect and boost the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Government officials say the plan will be implemented soon, but are not specific.</p>
<p>The manufacturing industry, which contributes about 24 percent to GDP but declined by 14 percent in 1995, is estimated to have grown by less than one percent in the first eight months of 1996 against a projected five percent growth rate for the year.</p>
<p>Its clothing and textile sector has almost collapsed since 1992 when neighbouring South Africa -- its main export market -- tripled duty on Zimbabwean goods to about 90 percent at the expiry of a preferential trade pact between the two countries.</p>
<p>South Africa has agreed in principle to cut the duty to their old rates, but the two countries are still negotiating.</p>
<p>&quot;High and sustainable economic growth is also going to depend on low interest rates, incentives to exporters and a realistic foreign exchange rate,&quot; Robertson said.</p>
<p>Interest rates have fallen to around 22 percent from 29 percent at the start of the year but were still high, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to watch South Africa (Zimbabwe's main trading partner). Its currency has been falling and we have to be competitive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe dollar has fallen by around 16.4 percent against the U.S. dollar in the past year, while the South African currency, on a trade-weighted basis, has shed about 22 percent.</p>
<p>Joe Foroma, chief executive of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), said the seven percent growth projected by many economists would also depend on reviving the manufacturing sector and ensuring borrowing was cheap for local industries.</p>
<p>&quot;These are areas we have to work hard on and the government must take the lead,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mugabe's government is under heavy pressure to cut state spending which currently accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, and which many blame for keeping interest rates high.</p>
<p>International donors, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, say they will help to fund an economic reform programme which Zimbabwe plans to launch later this year only after seeing progress in state spending cuts.</p>
