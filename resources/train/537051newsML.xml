<p>Robin Cook, the man who will be Britain's next foreign secretary if the opposition Labour Party wins the May 1 election, is a feared political operator widely regarded as one of the most intelligent men in parliament.</p>
<p>Whenever the short, red-bearded Scot headed towards the House of Commons dispatch box, Conservative ministers tensed themselves for the tongue-lashing which inevitably followed.</p>
<p>On paper, a minister with a razor-sharp mind and little tolerance for fools should be the ideal defender of British interests at a turning point in the country's history.</p>
<p>But one of the worst-kept secrets in British politics is that Cook would rather be Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) than Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>Cook's problem is that the job of Chancellor will be occupied by a man he has known for 25 years but can hardly bear to talk to -- Gordon Brown, a fellow Scot.</p>
<p>Cook belongs to the traditional left wing of Labour while Brown is much closer to the modernising party leader Tony Blair, who has discarded much of the movement's socialist tenets since taking charge in 1994.</p>
<p>Blair cannot afford to ditch 51-year-old Cook, who enjoys wide respect among the party's left wing and is expected to be one of the undisputed stars of a future Labour government.</p>
<p>Cook, a prickly man with a small circle of close friends who refers good-humouredly to his lack of &quot;classic good looks&quot; -- but is less charitably described by columnists as a &quot;gnome&quot; -- is a fanatic horse racing fan and writes a regular tipster's guide for the Glasgow Herald newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;The two most exciting sights and noises I know are these: first, the colour and noise of a large field coming into a steeplechase fence, which is a tremendous spectacle,&quot; he told an interviewer.</p>
<p>&quot;The other is the clang of the tin ballot boxes as they hit the gymnasium floor coming off the back of the trucks on election night.&quot;</p>
<p>RELISHES A GOOD FIGHT</p>
<p>Cook may have been in parliament for 22 years but is still clearly invigorated by the prospect of a good political battle.</p>
<p>One of his finest moments came in February last year when parliament debated a report on arms sales to Iraq before the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Cook was given a copy of the report just an hour before the debate but managed to absorb enough data to launch an damning assault on the government which Blair described as one of the most brilliant performances in his parliamentary career.</p>
<p>For the time being Cook is happy to focus on the task ahead by talking about how he plans to smooth Britain's relations with the European Union, which have sunk to rock bottom under the ruling Conservatives.</p>
<p>&quot;(I will) be at the top table making sure the European Union works successfully rather than sitting on the sidelines shouting abuse,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cook still stays true to the internationalist roots of old Labour, which eschewed militarism and the arms trade, and says he wants to boost the role of the British Commonwealth.</p>
<p>But Steve Crawshaw, deputy foreign editor of the Independent newspaper, is not impressed by the idea of Cook fighting Britain's corner.</p>
<p>&quot;He talks about foreign affairs with the pat confidence of somebody who has scanned through a few briefing papers, and quickly formed a view, not much caring whether it is right or wrong,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Cook treats the Great Abroad as an extension of the House of Commons, where impressing the colleagues, or the domestic viewers (and voters) is all that really counts. This is, to put it mildly, depressing.&quot;</p>
<p>WHAT WILL HE DO NEXT?</p>
<p>With little chance of Cook becoming chancellor in the foreseeable future, hardly a day goes by without fresh speculation about what he might end up doing.</p>
<p>Cook is a keen fan of parliamentary reform and together with the minority Liberal Democrats worked out plans to revolutionise politics by holding a referendum on adopting proportional representation and backing devolution for Scotland and Wales.</p>
<p>Some in the party say they would not be surprised to see him as head of a Scottish parliament or even de facto leader of a sovereign Scotland -- rumours Cook has done nothing to dispel.</p>
<p>Robert Finlayson Cook was born on February 28, 1946. He is married with two children.</p>
