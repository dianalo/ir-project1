<p>The U.N. war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia set a deadline on Saturday for Croatia to comply with its subpoena for evidence on indicted war criminal, Bosnian Croat general Tihomir Blaskic.</p>
<p>The subpoena, issued to Croatia and its Defence Minister Gojko Susak on January 15, must be complied with by August 18, the tribunal said in a statement from the Trial Chamber II.</p>
<p>The subpoena calls on Croatia to hand over to the prosecutor 13 specified categories of documents believed to be of evidentiary value in relation to the Blaskic case, the tribunal said.</p>
<p>Sources in Croatia say these documents include Blaskic's notes sent to the Croatian Defence Ministry, orders he received from Mata Boban -- former head of the Bosnian Croat separatist entity Herceg-Bosnia -- and the ministry's records on arms supplies to Bosnian Croat forces.</p>
<p>The case has created tension between the tribunal and Croatia, which has stood behind Blaskic.</p>
<p>The Croatian government said in February it reserved the right to observe the interests of its national security when assisting the tribunal.</p>
<p>The tribunal said in its statement it had both inherent and express powers to issue a subpoena duces tecum, with which states and their officials were under obligation to comply.</p>
<p>Blaskic, aged 36, is accused of directing a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign.</p>
<p>He is charged with crimes against humanity committed against Moslems in central Bosnia from 1992 to 1994, when he was a colonel commanding Bosnian Croat (HVO) militia forces. He denies the charges. His trial started on June 24.</p>
<p>The tribunal said the trial chamber had ordered Croatia and its defence minister to comply with the subpoena by August 18 of this year, or to appear before the international tribunal to explain the reasons for non-compliance.</p>
