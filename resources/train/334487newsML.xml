<title>HUNGARY: Hungary Jews say Swiss list fraction of total.</title>

<p>Hungary's Jewish community said on Monday that a Swiss list of 33 former bank account owners was just a fraction of what they believed could be the total number of accounts of Hungarian holocaust victims.</p>
<p>&quot;These are just those who had an account under their own name,&quot; Peter Feldmayer, President of the Association of Hungarian Jewish Communities (MAZSIHISZ), told Reuters. &quot;Typically, these accounts were either unnamed or dummy accounts.&quot;</p>
<p>Switzerland on Monday handed Hungary the 33-name list of wartime accounts which were declared ownerless after World War Two and the money was credited to Budapest.</p>
<p>According to Hungarian foreign ministry sources, Switzerland and Hungary concluded a confidential protocol in 1973 by which Switzerland transferred 325,000 Swiss francs ($229,600) from bank deposits of Jews who perished in World War Two to the Hungarian government.</p>
<p>The protocol was attached to interstate property and wartime compensation agreements concluded in 1950 and 1973.</p>
<p>Feldmayer said it was almost impossible to estimate the actual number of accounts formerly held by Hungarian Jews but believed it could be &quot;a few thousand at most&quot;.</p>
<p>He added that MAZSIHISZ will search for the inheritors and the rest of the money will go into a Jewish foundation to be set up shortly for administering primarily domestic compensation.</p>
<p>Last October Hungary's parliament approved a law creating a foundation to administer property confiscated from Hungarian Jews during World War Two and to oversee payments to survivors of the Nazi extermination campaign.</p>
<p>The government promised to set up the foundation in July after talks with the World Jewish Congress and other groups.</p>
<p>Some 600,000 of Hungary's 800,000 Jews perished in Nazi labour or concentration camps. There are an estimated 100,000 Jews in Hungary today, including 20,000 holocaust survivors.</p>
