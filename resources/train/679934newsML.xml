<p>A raging wind storm at Codelco's Andina copper mine caused power blackouts over the weekend, stopping production for several hours, but output was running normally by Monday, a spokesman for the mine said.</p>
<p>The mine's open pit Sur-Sur mine was closed according to schedule for the winter months, while the underground mine and the concentrator, also underground, were working normally despite two meters of snow on the ground, said the spokesman.</p>
<p>Andina's 150,000 tonnes of production a year is about evenly divided between the open pit and underground mines.</p>
<p>Central Chile has been lashed by heavy rain and wind since Thursday, causing floods and landslides, while heavy snowfall has cut roads at higher elevations. The country's main copper belt in the far north has been spared the rains.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the only direct impact on production was from a powerful windstorm over the weekend, which knocked out power. Electricity was restored and production back to normal by Monday, he said.</p>
<p>Concentrates are transported out of the concentrator by an underground pipeline to a lower-elevation spot, so heavy snow at the mine about 100 km northeast of Santiago hasn't affected it, said the spokesman.</p>
