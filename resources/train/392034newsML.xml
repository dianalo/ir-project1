<p>Cuba, the world's largest sugar producer until 1960, is struggling to boost sales of its chief export as it feels the pinch from a tightened political and economic noose.</p>
<p>Analysts in the international sugar market say that, so far, it is having mixed success.</p>
<p>Long recognised as a major player on the world sugar scene, socialist Cuba has come under increasing pressure since the collapse of the Soviet Union and its east European satellites -- its main sponsors and trading partners.</p>
<p>A communist-era protocol exchanging Russian oil for Cuban sugar has been precarious since the two sides started to hurl accusations of high prices and late deliveries.</p>
<p>The United States has tightened the economic noose around the island by expanding its decades-old trade embargo to deter third countries from investing in Cuba.</p>
<p>And other major sugar producers in the region such as Brazil and Mexico are growing more cane to try to snatch an even larger share of the world export market.</p>
<p>Until 1960 Cuba was the world's largest sugar producer and even in 1990 managed to turn out a bumper 8.44 million tonnes, raw value, according to data from the International Sugar Organization (ISO).</p>
<p>Five years later the economic repercussions of the demise of the Soviet Union had taken their toll and output was the lowest for 50 years at just 3.26 million tonnes.</p>
<p>But while Cuba's capacity to expand production can be seen as a threat hanging over world prices, analysts say a return to the days of 8.0 million tonnes is unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;Cuba would be unable to sell eight million tonnes, it (output) is more likely to be between 5.5 and 6.0 million,&quot; said Christoph Berg, analyst at German statistician F.O. Licht.</p>
<p>&quot;The capacity will definitely shrink because there are much more lucrative investments for Cuba than the sugar industry,&quot; he said, citing tourism as an example.</p>
<p>TOURISM NOW BIGGEST HARD CURRENCY EARNER</p>
<p>Tourism is the fastest-growing economic sector on the island and has overtaken sugar as the biggest hard currency earner in gross income terms.</p>
<p>London sugar traders said the enforced higher output during the 1980s had harmed younger cane and a lot more investment would be needed to return to those levels.</p>
<p>&quot;It's technically possible but it would not be logical,&quot; said Tony Hannah, the ISO's chief economist.</p>
<p>&quot;They should take the opportunity...to restructure their industry with foreign investment on an ethical basis. Better to produce six million tonnes profitably than produce eight million and lose money.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of the reason for producing so much sugar in the past was the Russian barter deal, a lifeline for Cuba after the United States closed off its lucrative market in reaction to Havana's swing to socialism in the 1960s.</p>
<p>&quot;Sugar was grown for political reasons without necessarily any real concept of how much it costs to grow because they were cushioned by the Russian protocol,&quot; said a London broker involved with trading Cuban sugar.</p>
<p>The deal allowed the Cubans to buy cheap oil while Moscow bought a major part of the cane crop at wildly-inflated prices and even picked up bad credits when poor harvests drove Havana onto world markets for supplies.</p>
<p>But the Soviet absence has put the deal under increasing commercial pressure -- and the game is no longer about helping Cuban communism but making money.</p>
<p>Havana resells the oil on world markets, while Russian sugar refiners get a steady supply of raw supplies. The deal provides for the exchange of 10.5 million tonnes of oil for four million of sugar between 1996 and 1998.</p>
<p>Although Russia continued its Cuban link by awarding the oil contract to two firms, Alfa-Eko and Menatep, in August 1995, problems arose when it said Cuba had illegally raised its sugar price and missed deadlines.</p>
<p>Despite the problems, there would probably still be some sort of sugar supply protocol but not necessarily tied to oil any more, Hannah said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very important to the Russian sugar industry and they fight like hell to keep it because it keeps their factories running for 12 months of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>IMPLICATIONS OF U.S TRADE EMBARGO</p>
<p>Not withstanding the problems with Russia, Cuba also has to contend with the latest revision to the U.S. trade embargo -- the so-called Helms-Burton law, which aims to sanction foreign investment in the island.</p>
<p>The law, named after its congressional sponsors, allows Americans to sue foreign firms or individuals deemed to have profited from investments in property confiscated by Cuba's communist government.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton has twice suspended the provision for six months -- the last time in January.</p>
<p>The law has been strongly criticised not just by Cuba but by U.S. allies such as Canada and the European Union.</p>
<p>Cuba has already felt some economic repercussions from the law but although some major investors have been deterred, others have been quick to take their place.</p>
<p>Last year the Dutch banking and insurance group ING said it would renew $30 million in loans to Cubazucar, the state sugar trading organisation.</p>
<p>Analysts said Helms-Burton would affect sugar production in the short term because of Cuba's dependency on short-term cash and also because investors know that the law was a deterrent to foreign funding offers.</p>
<p>&quot;Helms-Burton could affect sugar output because the credit risk is rising...the arrival of pesticides and fertilisers was delayed simply because there was an interruption in the flow of credit,&quot; Berg said.</p>
<p>&quot;It surely has some impact on the outcome of the harvest. I believe the credit crunch is one of the biggest challenges to the sugar industry in Cuba.&quot;</p>
<p>Cuba has allowed foreign investment since 1995, resulting in the first shipments of fertiliser to the cane-growing provinces for years.</p>
<p>Hannah said the longer-term impact should be slight.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a psychological effect rather than physical, it has relatively little effect. Even if ING pull out, there'll be somebody to take their place,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>OTHER POTENTIAL FOREIGN BUYERS</p>
<p>With the loss of its main export market and the extra U.S. pressure, Cuba has been forced to look elsewhere to cement long-term contracts with foreign buyers.</p>
<p>China has long been high on Havana's list of importers and there are plans to expand exports to the Far East and thus compete with other major raws suppliers in the region such as Australia and Thailand.</p>
<p>But relations with Spain, one of Cuba's leading trading partners, have been under increasing strain because the new conservative government has taken a harder stance on Cuba since it took over from the Socialists last May.</p>
<p>Spain recently cancelled a $15 million credit line for exports of industrial goods that Cuba was aiming to use in its sugar sector, citing technical reasons.</p>
<p>Last month, however, France and Cuba agreed to renew an annual food-for-sugar barter through 1997, valued at some $175 million.</p>
