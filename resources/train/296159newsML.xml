<headline>Away on Business: women on the road.</headline>

<p>For every three women travelling on business in the United States a decade ago there are four today, and despite their growing ranks many feel they are poorly treated.</p>
<p>That was the message in a recent study by Uniglobe Travel (International) Inc., which reports that feedback from many of its leading travel agencies reflects concerns among women about security, service and equal treatment.</p>
<p>Michelle Desreux, senior vice president of the company and a veteran of 20 years of worldwide business travel, said there has been some improvement but security especially was still a concern.</p>
<p>She cited some recent experiences:</p>
<p>-- On a visit to Chicago her hotel promised a fitness facility but failed to say it closed at 9:30 p.m. Checking in after that hour, she was told the hotel had an arrangement with an off-premise club.</p>
<p>After arriving there, Desreux found that it was a private club, and was left not only without a workout but also in a strange neighbourhood looking for a way back to the hotel.</p>
<p>-- On checking into a hotel in Florida the desk attendant announced her room number for all to hear, a practice that security experts warn against and some properties strictly prohibit.</p>
<p>-- At another Florida hotel Desreux said she could see an automated teller machine down the street but was told by a security guard that it wasn't safe to go outside to use it.</p>
<p>The hotel did not offer to escort her down the street to use the one a half block away, she added, and a cash machine in the hotel would have solved the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>She said the travel industry needs to close the gap between what women expect and what they get. Her company's survey found that women believe men get better attention from the travel industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This attitude permeates everything from supplier advertising that focuses only on men to face-to-face client service. No doubt, service across the board has improved but women travelers report that gender biases by suppliers continue.&quot;</p>
<p>It can be simple things, she added.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there ever anyone at a car rental that can help a woman with a big presentation case? Usually no. It's not a big thing but it's bothersome,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The situation is two-sided, she added. Women need to become more competent travelers by speciying in their travel profiles what they expect -- secure rooms, for instance, near an elevator with no outside ground floor access and not in remote areas of hotel properties.</p>
<p>Both the industry and those who arrange travel need to develop a sensitivity to those same demands, she said.</p>
