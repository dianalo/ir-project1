<p>South Island Maori tribe Ngai Tahu are pressing government ministers to free up more time for negotiations if they want a deal on the historical land claim before the election.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jim Bolger told a meeting of the Hawkes' Bay Maori Business Association late on Wednesday that &quot;Crown and Ngai Tahu negotiators are now well advanced in working through the details of the large Ngai Tahu claim and are making good progress&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We may get an agreement in principle before the election,&quot; Bolger said.  </p>
<p>But in an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Ngai Tahu chief negotiator Sir Tipene O'Regan seemed less optimistic, although he said an agreement in principle was still possible.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a few -- very few -- major stumbling blocks in which the Ngai Tahu and Crown positions appear to be irreconcilable,&quot; O'Regan said.</p>
<p>&quot;These issues have to be cleared at a political level. They are not really for officials to negotiate.&quot;</p>
<p>He said an agreement in principle would depend on the government &quot;better activating its negotiating process&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;You'll appreciate the election season makes it extremely difficult to get the full attention of ministers.&quot;</p>
<p>Beehive sources said the government had put a &quot;final offer&quot; to the Ngai Tahu of about the same size as the successful $170 million Tanui Waikato settlement struck last year. But there were differences between the parties over whether customary or aboriginal rights would be included in the settlement.</p>
<p>One source said the smaller eastern North Island Whakatohea claim was also close to settlement.</p>
<p>New Zealand First's Te Tai Rawhiti electorate candidate John Delamere is chief negotiator for the Whakatohea claim.  </p>
<p>The government is keen to settle land claims before the election, due on October 12, to reap the political benefit while Maori negotiators are keen to see a settlement now because a change of government could slow or interupt the process.</p>
<p>An announcement on at least part of the Ngai Tahu setlement is expected early next week.</p>
