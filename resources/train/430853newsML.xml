<p>Nepal's communists and their allies proposed to form a government on Monday and said they controlled enough seats in parliament to rule for the second time since multi-party democracy began seven years ago.</p>
<p>Unified Marxist-Leninist (UML) General Secretary Madav Kumar Nepal and Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the centrist Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) registered a joint claim to govern at the gates of King Birendra's palace, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The communist and RPP leaders were accompanied by Gajendra Narayan Singh, leader of the Nepal Sudbhavana Party (NSP).</p>
<p>Both the RPP and NSP had supported the government, led by the centrist Nepali Congress, that resigned last week after losing a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>The UML leader told Reuters outside the palace that his party and its allies controlled 103 of 205 seats in the lower house of parliament -- just enough to survive -- and would support the RPP's Chand as the new prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;We have produced 103 signatures supporting Chand,&quot; Nepal said.</p>
<p>Nepali Congress officials said their plan to stake a rival claim appeared in trouble. &quot;I think we cannot form the government,&quot; Chakra Prasad Bahtola, tourism minister in the caretaker cabinet, told Reuters. &quot;They (RPP) have crossed over.&quot;</p>
<p>The king, who abandoned his absolute powers in 1990 but remains a constitutional monarch, had given parties until Monday evening to stake a claim to power. Authorities said he could ask Chand as soon as Monday evening to form a new government.</p>
<p>The policies of the three largest parties, including the UML which includes social democrats, are broadly similar.</p>
<p>About 100 UML and RPP activists crowded around the entrance to the king's palace, applauding the UML and RPP leaders.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba resigned on Thursday after his Nepali Congress-led government suffered a razor-thin defeat in a confidence vote.</p>
<p>His three-party coalition had taken over in September 1995 from the communist UML, which assumed power at the head of a minority government following inconclusive polls in 1994.</p>
<p>Fighting among the three ruling parties undercut Deuba's coalition and led to the defection last week of at least 10 of the RPP's 19 lawmakers to the communist side.</p>
<p>UML is the biggest single party in the House of Representatives with 90 votes. It could count on 10 RPP votes, the NSP's two votes and one vote belonging to the communist Nepal Workers and Peasants Party (NWPP), UML sources said.</p>
<p>The Nepali Congress has 87 seats, but two of its lawmakers abstained in the test vote last week.</p>
<p>Chand was twice prime minister under the Panchayat system of government which lasted from 1961 until 1990 and permitted the king to rule directly over a partyless assembly.</p>
<p>King Birendra bowed to pro-democracy demonstrators in 1990 and accepted a multi-party democracy in which many of the Panchayat leaders grouped together under the RPP banner.</p>
<p>Chand broke ranks with Deuba in March 1996, saying his Nepali Congress was dominating the centre-right coalition.</p>
<p>But he later returned to the government after Deuba survived a no-confidence motion. Chand split away again last December before Deuba turned back another censure motion.</p>
<p>Deuba then called a confidence motion which he lost last week, provoking his downfall. King Birendra has asked him to remain as caretaker leader until a new government is formed.</p>
