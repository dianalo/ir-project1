<p>A pro-British Loyalist leader in Northern Ireland on Saturday demanded an Anglo-Irish crackdown on resurgent IRA guerrillas and urged Protestants not to be drawn into a sectarian war.</p>
<p>Gary McMichael pledged his Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) would strive to persuade its banned Loyalist military allies to stick to their shaky 28-month truce and avert worsening conflict in British-ruled Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>&quot;Republicans do not want a settlement. They want war. It is our priority to ensure that they do not have it,&quot; McMichael, whose UDP is the political wing of the outlawed Ulster Defence Assocation, told his annual party's conference.</p>
<p>With IRA fighters recently intensifying their long campaign to end British rule, McMichael said that London and Dublin, who are partners in the fragile peace drive, should take decisive action and protect the law-abiding community.</p>
<p>&quot;They must meet (the) threat directly and with immediacy before we are plunged back into greater conflict.&quot;</p>
<p>His appeal came after a wave of violence by IRA fighters who recently ruled out any let-up this side of a spring general election in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Earlier, Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA's Sinn Fein political arm, facing mounting pressure from nationalist opponents to back an unconditional end to war, said he would press for a new IRA truce if Britain eased Sinn Fein's path to peace talks.</p>
<p>A political analyst in the Dublin-based Irish Times newspaper which printed a wide-ranging article by Adams said his comments might be &quot;a coded signal&quot; to London that republicans want to build bridges to end deadlock in the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>
<p>But a new cloud loomed when David Trimble, head of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, said Protestants should be allowed to hold a controversial march in a Roman Catholic area next July.</p>
<p>A similar parade last year engulfed the British province in turmoil, seven months after the IRA ditched their 17 month long truce with a series of bomb attacks in mainland Britain.</p>
<p>Trimble was quoted saying that an annual parade by the ancient Orange Order should be allowed along Garvaghy Road in Portadown in July. Catholics are firmly opposed to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Garvaghy Road is the main thoroughfare. There is a duty on the authorities to make sure that the Queen's highway is available to all..,&quot; Trimble told The Irish-American Post magazine.</p>
<p>McMichael said if the Loyalist truce collapsed and violence intensfied, the situation would be difficult to retrieve.</p>
<p>&quot;That is where we are being dragged even though the vast majority of people in the (Protestant) Unionist and (Catholic) nationalist communities have no support for further violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Loyalist hardliners, so-called because of a fierce allegiance to Britain, have launched three apparently retaliatory attacks on Catholic nationalists since December.</p>
<p>Britain says that a truce called by Loyalist commanders in October 1994 is still officially in operation.</p>
<p>Adams urged Britain to remove what he termed its &quot;veto&quot; on Sinn Fein's entry to talks. He said demands for a handover of IRA weapons must not block talks and Britain should implement &quot;confidence-building measures&quot; among nationalists.</p>
<p>&quot;When a meaningful and inclusive process of negotiations is genuinely being offered we could, with credibility, seek to persuade the IRA to restore the cessation (of violence) of August 1994,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;I firmly believe that if clear assurances are given by the British government that a negotiations process which is both viable and credible will be put in place then the peace process can be restored..,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Britain says the IRA used its truce to plan a new bombing campaign to back up political argument with military muscle.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major says Sinn Fein will be admitted to the talks only after his intelligence agencies are satisfied that any future IRA truce is meant to last.</p>
