<title>SWEDEN: Turkish author Kemal seeks asylum in Sweden.</title>
<headline>Turkish author Kemal seeks asylum in Sweden.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1996-11-21</dateline>

<p>One of Turkey's most famous living authors, Yasar Kemal, has fled his homeland and sought asylum in Sweden, friends and Swedish media said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said Kemal arrived in Sweden on Saturday and was staying at a secret address with his Belgian wife Mathilde.</p>
<p>The 73-year-old author has been convicted by a Turkish court for his writings in which he defended Kurds' rights in Turkey. The court said he had promoted Kurdish separatism.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kemals are now in a hotel in Stockholm and they intend to stay here for an indefinite period,&quot; said Eugene Schulgin, deputy chairman of the Swedish PEN club.</p>
<p>Kemal was in hiding becase he faced murder threats from Turkish extremists, he said.</p>
<p>Schulgin said a Turkish court had passed a suspended jail sentence on Kemal, and he would go to prison if he renewed his defence of Kurdish rights.</p>
<p>Friends had organised a home for Kemal, where he was seeking peace and quiet to finish a trilogy of novels, he added.</p>
<p>Kemal's lawyer denied the writer had sought asylum in Sweden. &quot;Kemal has taken no political asylum in Sweden. There is no such thing. It is a lie,&quot; Enver Nalbant told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Yasar Kemal and his wife are on a visit to Sweden. They only have a tourist visa and as Kemal was bored he went on a trip mainly to Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>A Swedish embassy spokesman in Ankara told Reuters; &quot;he has been granted a six-month residence permit from November 5 by the Swedish immigration board.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swedish Foreign Ministry said it could not confirm that Kemal was seeking a Swedish residence permit.</p>
<p>Kemal, who wrote the acclaimed &quot;Memed, My Hawk&quot;, spent two years in exile in Sweden in the 1970s.</p>
