<p>Papua New Guinea's Sir Julius Chan, who was forced to temporarily step aside from the prime ministership this year after hiring mercenaries to quell a rebellion, on Monday lost a national poll by a thin margin.</p>
<p>Chan lost his seat by a narrow 110 votes to academic Ephraim Apelis, the country's electorial commission said.</p>
<p>He must now step down as prime minister.</p>
<p>Chan's defeat adds to a growing list of ministers, including the defence minister, Mathias Ijape, to be thrown out of office in a wave of discontent against Chan's plan to use mercenaries to solve the seccessionist rebellion on the copper-rich island of Bougainville.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Papua New Guinea's first prime minister Sir Michael Somare, who has already won his seat, is likely to form the next coalition government with his National Alliance and independents.</p>
<p>Chan has been an unpopular figure in Papua New Guinea since March when it emerged he was behind a US$36 million deal to hire African mercenaries to quash a secessionist rebellion on Bougainville.</p>
<p>The revelations sparked an army mutiny. Senior army officers said they were fed up with corruption and called for the government to resign. Civilians rioted for two days before Chan resigned as prime minister while an official inquiry was held.</p>
<p>Chan reclaimed the prime-ministership in early June, saying the inquiry had cleared him. He has held the post since Papua New Guinea was granted independence from Australia in 1975.</p>
<p>Voting in national elections in the the South Pacific nation of 4.3 million people began on June 12 and finished on Saturday. The final results for all constituencies will not be known until July 15.</p>
