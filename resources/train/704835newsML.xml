<p>Some Australian stocks to watch this morning:</p>
<p>* Normandy Mining Ltd A$1.46 (-.06)</p>
<p>* Lihir Gold Ltd A$2.13 (-.06)</p>
<p>* Plutonic Resources Ltd A$4.18 (-.12)</p>
<p>* Newcrest Mining Ltd A$3.41 (-0.22)</p>
<p>Gold stocks under pressure after gold prices slump to a 12 year low in late New York trade, sparked by news that the Reserve Bank of Australia has sold 167 tones of gold from its reserves. Traders said the sale confirmed that central banks worldwide were looking to sell down their gold assets and invest in areas which offer better returns. In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted US$325.00/50 an ounce.</p>
<p>* Coles Myer Ltd A$7.04 (+.123)</p>
<p>* Woolworths Ltd A$4.439 (+.069)</p>
<p>Credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said in a report on the industry that Coles and Woolworths were likely to increase their share of the grocery market, which is poised to exceed average retail sales over the next few years. Increasing demand for food would defy a difficult retailing environment, it said.</p>
<p>* MIM Holdings Ltd A$1.94 (-0.01)</p>
<p>Base metals miner MIM Holdings Ltd said on Friday it will cut ore production at its Mount Isa 1100 copper mine to 3.6 million from 4.4 million a year as part of processing improvements ahead of the start-up of the new Ernest Henry and Enterprise mines.</p>
