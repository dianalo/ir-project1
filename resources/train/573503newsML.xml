<p>Telecom Corp of New Zealand's days of posting ever-burgeoning profits may be over, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the operating environment is certainly very difficult and it is quite possible that we won't see earnings growing at as fast a rate as has traditionally been the case,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Michelle Eisig.  </p>
<p>The phone utility's bottom line profit for the year to March, due on Wednesday, could come in well below last year's $716.8 million, due mainly to abnormal costs and provisions that are something of an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>Telecom has already indicated that a provision of $35-55 million would be made for loss-making Australian subsidiary Pacific Star, which it is currently in the process of divesting. Whether Pacific Star's fourth quarter operating losses are covered by that provision is uncertain.  </p>
<p>The company has also said it is considering inclusion of millennium provisions in its 1997 financial statements that would run to &quot;tens of millions&quot; of dollars. The costs involve adjusting computers to account for the year 2000.</p>
<p>Analysts said the restructure costs for Telecom's Design Build and Maintenance Division were also unclear.</p>
<p>Add to that the start-up costs associated with Telecom's Internet vehicle Xtra and pay-tv operation First Media, and the bottom line profit could easily be in the region of $650-660 million.  </p>
<p>Even without the one-offs, analysts expect a flat profit of around NZ$718 million. That forecast includes the losses incurred by Pacific Star in the first three quarters but excludes the possible one-offs alluded to by Telecom.</p>
<p>&quot;But we're not too worried about the bottom line,&quot; said Doyle Paterson Brown analyst Kevin Bennett.</p>
<p>&quot;Our focus really is on the operating performance.&quot;</p>
<p>Telecom's core earnings growth has slowed in the troughing New Zealand economy.  </p>
<p>&quot;We certainly saw in the third quarter of the 1997 financial year that earnings growth in the core businesses was not tracking at as strong a rate as has traditionally been the case,&quot; Eisig said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure part of it at least is attributable to very weak economic conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Cellular earnings are expected to be flat as a result of the economic downturn because, as one analyst put it, &quot;in a slowing economy, the first thing I would stop using is my cell phone&quot;.  </p>
<p>But there are concerns that Telecom's earnings growth has been arrested by more than just the sluggish economy, and that the company's halcyon days are over.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally don't believe it's a short-term aberration. I think Telecom have seen their non-contestable products and services come under attack,&quot; said one analyst, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;Some are still very bullish on the future for Telecom, but at the moment I wouldn't be one of them. Where is the growth going to continue to come from? It's a small market.&quot;  </p>
<p>It is an opinion investors seem to have shared this year. Telecom shares have fallen from a peak of $7.60 in early January to $6.70 on Friday. They have traded as low as $6.27.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed profit concerns would continue to dog Telecom for some time to come, but Bennett said the fact that core earnings were growing even modestly was a credit to the company in the current economic environment.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been very difficult for Telecom to continue growing at 15 percent-plus per annum ad infinitum, just because of the size of the company and the economy,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Now they're moving into a highly competitive environment, and yes, the return will be less. But I still think the stock is well managed and has growth prospects.&quot;</p>
<p>Bennett expects Telecom's fourth quarter profit to come in at around $200 million, up from $196.6 million a year ago.</p>
<p>He said Telecom could be expected to achieve operating leverage from a stronger economy in calendar 1998 and would be better focused once rid of its Pacific Star millstone.</p>
