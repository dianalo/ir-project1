<p>Germany's business sector needs a political signal to get investment flowing again, the Federation of German Cooperative Banks (BVR) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Booming exports, moderate wage agreements and low interest rates had given companies more freedom to invest. But they remained reticent because the government's fiscal and tax policies were unclear, BVR said in a regular report.</p>
<p>&quot;Enterprises need a clear and reliable decision to cut the tax and withholdings burden to an internationally- competitive level,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The well-known burdens of doing business in Germany were leading many German firms to invest actively in other countries, while few foreign firms invested in Germany, it said.</p>
<p>Business groups have attacked Finance Minister Theo Waigel's tax reform package, saying it will raise rather than lower corporate taxes.</p>
<p>The tax reform was passed on Thursday by parliament's lower house but faces almost certain failure in the opposition-controlled upper house, which will send it to a mediation process.</p>
