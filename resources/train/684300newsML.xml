<p>A Jewish human rights group demanded on Tuesday a full accounting of why the Allies returned tonnes of gold to Austria after World War Two even though more than a million Austrians fought for Hitler.</p>
<p>Opening a conference on restitution of Jewish property looted by the Nazis, Marvin Hier of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Centre sought to broaden the spotlight on the wartime era to lands other than just Switzerland.</p>
<p>Swiss authorities have begun to review their wartime role as a financial centre with close ties to the Nazis, the rabbi said, but now other countries must follow suit.</p>
<p>He said Sweden, Spain, Portugal, France, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Chile had to account for wealth they accumulated from Germany or confiscated from Nazi victims, but he singled out Austria for special criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;We must know the truth about why Austria got such a large share of the Nazi gold&quot; that the Allies returned to occupied countries after the war, Hier said.</p>
<p>The Tripartite Gold Commission set up by Britain, France and the United States after the war returned some $4 billion of gold over five years to European central banks.</p>
<p>Hier said Austria got 33.8 tonnes of gold from the commission in 1947 and another 12 tonnes by 1952, excluding 4.7 the United States handed over to Austria in 1945.</p>
<p>This was to compensate Vienna for its claim on 100 tonnes of gold the Nazis transferred to the German Reichsbank after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision was outrageous, because that gold belonged entirely to the victims of the Holocaust,&quot; Hier told the opening session of the two-day conference.</p>
<p>He said Washington should have told Austria: &quot;You are not entitled to this gold because this is gold that was plundered from the victims while your country fought on the side of the plunderers.&quot;</p>
<p>He said more than 99 percent of Austrians approved the annexation in an April 1938 plebiscite. &quot;In addition, 1.2 million Austrians fought for Hitler in the German Army and (the elite Nazi force) SS,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Allied powers agreed during World War Two to treat Austria as a victim rather than perpetrator of Nazi aggression. Austria was occupied by both Western and Soviet Allied forces in 1945 and won back its sovereignty as a Western-oriented democracy in the mid-1950s after agreeing to indefinite neutrality. Foreign troops then withdrew.</p>
<p>Hier suggested the West's fear of the spread of communism led it to pay Austria what he termed a &quot;bribe&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The world deserves to know who in the United States made such a decision -- to reward those who flew the swastika with gold stolen from the victims of the 'Final Solution',&quot; Hier said, referring to the systematic murder of around six million European Jews in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Hier credited Switzerland for facing its past squarely by creating a panel of historians to review the country's wartime role and by easing banking secrecy to help search for the dormant wealth of Holocaust victims in banks.</p>
<p>Berne has created a 270 million Swiss franc ($188 million) memorial fund financed by private businesses and the Swiss central bank to help needy Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>It has also proposed a huge humanitarian fund to help victims of poverty, disasters and human rights abuses at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet at the same time we should be quite clear that these deeds, however welcome and however bold, are not acts of charity,&quot; Hier said. &quot;They are simply the return of stolen property that should never have been taken in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas Borer, the Swiss diplomat coordinating Berne's response to charges that it cynically profited from World War Two, rejected Hier's allegation that &quot;billions of dollars in today's money robbed from the victims of Nazism lie in the coffers of Swiss banks and other institutions&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I would refrain from using the term 'billions' here,&quot; Borer told a panel discussion, adding that Switzerland was determined to return every last franc that may remain here to its rightful owners.</p>
<p>He also called on &quot;some Anglo-Saxon circles&quot; and the media to stop demonising the Swiss as Hitler's eager collaborators, charges he said were unjust and hindering the search for historical truth.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I, a Swiss citizen born in 1957, have to explain now that Switzerland never passed racial laws, never set up concentration camps, and that pro-Nazi and fascist groups were marginal?&quot; ($ = 1.436 Swiss Francs)</p>
