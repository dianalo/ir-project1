<p>An abnormal flow of corn from southern U.S. states into the Midwest this month has been &quot;spotty&quot; based on processor needs and is tailing off as the southern Midwest harvest begins, chairman and chief executive officer Richard Anderson of The Andersons Inc said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's extremely spotty from a position, location and time basis,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;These deals are just a week forward.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. corn stocks have fallen to the lowest levels in years as exports and feed demand soar, putting corn processors from Ohio to Iowa in a squeeze to secure grain, grain traders said.  </p>
<p>Most Corn Belt harvesting does not usually get underway until early October, so in recent weeks large processors have bid as much as $1.50 over CBOT September futures to draw early harvested grain from states like Louisiana and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Grain merchandisers reported corn barge shipments from the south as far north as Cincinnati to meet processor demand.</p>
<p>&quot;We're beginning to contract some mid-September corn. We're getting nice premiums for that so this will all play out,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;Because we're working from mid-September back to the present, we're working on premiums from 40 cents to $1 on the September (futures),&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, rail corn was still quoted as $1 over CBOT September on Thursday, though in most other locations the processor market collapsed late Monday as nearby needs were finally covered. Iowa plants led the drop.</p>
<p>&quot;It moves so fast as this crop comes on,&quot; Anderson said of the current cash corn price in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Most Midwest corn is usually harvested late in order to let it dry down in fields. But the southern harvest has moved steadily northward, with about five percent of the corn in the southern third of Missouri harvested as of last Sunday, according to the weekly state crop report.</p>
<p>The Andersons operates 12 grain elevators in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan with a combined grain storage capacity of 68 million bushels.</p>
