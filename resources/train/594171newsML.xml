<p>The following stories were reported in this week's Bulgarian business newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy:</p>
<p>BANKER</p>
<p>-- State-owned Balkanbank and Economic Bank said at a meeting with Balkan Airlines management that they insisted the company should immediately start paying its debts to them of 11 million levs and 7.7 million levs respectively, otherwise both banks would file an insolvency suit against the state carrier.</p>
<p>-- The Bulgarian National Bank on May 15 withdrew the licence of First Private Bank, which had been in receivership since May 17, 1996, for failing to comply with banking regulations. Central bank officials said that only an investment of $60 million can save the bank.</p>
<p>-- The Bulgarian-American Investment Bank will soon start operations on Bulgarian financial markets, its management said. The bank is to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on June 6, expected to make changes in its executive board. In March, bank shareholders decided that it should raise its capital to 1.4 billion levs from 450 million levs.</p>
<p>-- Seven big state-owned banks continued to operate after the central bank put 14 commercial banks in receivership in 1996. The seven banks, which are are Bulbank, State Savings Bank, United Bulgarian Bank, Hebrosbank, Expressbank, Post Bank and Biohim, are controlling some 88.5 percent of the market.</p>
<p>-- The introduction of a currency board system is the only way out of the crisis, finance minister designate Muravei Radev said in an interview. He said he was optimistic that Bulgaria could negotiate a rescheduling of its debt to the Paris Club of official creditors.</p>
<p>CAPITAL</p>
<p>-- The lev fell to some 1,700 to the dollar last week after being fairly steady around 1,500 for several weeks due to the cuts in the main interest rate. The rate cut discouraged investment in government securities and free levs were now channelled to the forex markets.</p>
<p>The central bank cut its main rate to 4.29 percent monthly form 5.20 percent, effective from May 19.</p>
<p>-- Bulgaria's outgoing interim prime minister Stefan Sofianski and Ivan Kostov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces and nominee for a premier, visited Germany last week to try to attract investment and boost economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Companies invited to their presentation by organisers Deutsche Bank AG included BASF AG , Bayer, Deutsche Telekom, Hoechst, Siemens, and the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) press group which owns several Bulgarian newspapers.</p>
<p>-- During the term of the caretaker cabinet Bulgaria has privatised 11 state enterprises and has launched a liquidation procedure for 27 state firms, said Alexander Bozhkov, interim industry minister, who is expected to retain his post in the new cabinet. He said that another 39 ailing state firms are not working and are to be closed down formally by the end of the year.</p>
