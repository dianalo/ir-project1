<p>There can be no talk at present of President Boris Yeltsin resigning for health reasons, Interfax news agency quoted Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is out of the question now,&quot; Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying in reply to a question of whether the president might resign. Chernomyrdin said he viewed the idea negatively and did not accept it.  </p>
<p>Opposition communists, whose leader lost to Yeltsin in July presidential elections, have been saying for the last two days that Yeltsin should consider stepping down if he is not fit to operate at full strength.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, speaking in the Tver region northwest of Moscow, also dismissed reports that the Russian leadership was split. &quot;I do not recognise any factions, there are no factions and there will be no factions while we are here,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin met Yeltsin on Tuesday in the Central Clinical Hospital where the 65-year-old president is preparing for heart surgery.</p>
<p>Yeltsin issued a decree last week saying Chernomyrdin would stand in for him while he has surgery, and he has already transferred some of his duties to the prime minister.</p>
