<title>SOUTH KOREA: Hanbo loans blamed on lack of credit analysis.</title>
<headline>Hanbo loans blamed on lack of credit analysis.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>South Korea's Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) said on Thursday domestic banks extended huge loans to the faltering Hanbo Steel Co without any proper credit analysis.</p>
<p>Five banks granted a total of 3.13 trillion won ($3.64 billion) in credits to Hanbo without adequate feasibility studies, the bank watchdog said in an interim briefing.</p>
<p>The OBS launched in January a special probe into the loans made by Korea First Bank, Cho Hung Bank, Korea Exchange Bank, SEOULBANK and the state-run Korea Development Bank.  </p>
<p>An OBS statement said Korea Development Bank and Cho Hung Bank lent 911.5 billion won on a 1.4 trillion mortgage, and 496 billion with 539.8 billion collateral, respectively.</p>
<p>But Korea First Bank extended a total of 1.1 trillion won in loans with only a 926.5 billion mortgage; Korea Exchange Bank gave out 429.8 billion won on 405.4 billion in collateral; and SEOULBANK, 210 billion won on a 173.5 billion mortgage.</p>
<p>The office also pointed to a lack of professional ratings companies in South Korea. &quot;Due to a sparcity of professional domestic ratings companies, financial institutions tend to analyse big projects by themselves,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The loans also have been given for the convenience of borrowers,&quot; OBS said.</p>
<p>Hanbo Steel, the flagship of the nation's 14th largest Hanbo Group, was declared insolvent on January 23 after piling up five trillion in loans.</p>
<p>Opposition parties called the loans the biggest financial scandal in the nation's history and have accused the government of peddling influence to pressure banks into offering loans.</p>
<p>State prosecutors indicted 10 people over the scandal on Wednesday, including three close aides to President Kim Young-sam.  </p>
<p>Three bankers are among those indicted, including two former presidents of Korea First Bank.</p>
<p>The watchdog body said it would turn over the results of probe to the banks by February 25, leaving action up to them. ($ = 859.30 won)</p>
