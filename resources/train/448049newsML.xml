<p>Italian coastguards rescued more than 800 Albanian refugees crammed like sardines aboard a decrepit navy ship on Monday after it took on water and threatened to sink.</p>
<p>The operation was the second major rescue in as many days as Albanians flee from anarchy in their Balkan homeland in a ramshackle armada of vessels.</p>
<p>&quot;They're all safe, now there is no danger at all,&quot; Admiral Renato Ferraro, head of the Italian coastguard, told Reuters after the lengthy operation off the southern port of Brindisi.</p>
<p>He said about 700 of the passengers had been transferred to a tug boat that would take them to the port of Bari.</p>
<p>Scuffles had broken out on the tug and Italian marines were being ferried aboard to help keep control, Ferraro said.</p>
<p>Another 91 Albanians, including some infants, were taken in two coastguard patrol boats to Brindisi. A further 34 who said they felt ill were sent ahead separately for medical checks.</p>
<p>Monday's arrivals took the number of Albanians who have crossed the Adriatic to Italy to escape this month's armed chaos to almost 6,000, Italian officials said.</p>
<p>The rescued passengers, including women and children, told officials they sailed from the southern Albanian port of Vlore some 40 miles away and been at sea for at least 20 hours.</p>
<p>Coastguard speedboats were taking them food and water.</p>
<p>Ferraro said the stricken ship had suffered problems with its rudder and was believed to have run out of fuel. Asked if it had been in danger of sinking, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course. It was very heavy because of (the number of) people on board and they were taking on water.&quot;</p>
<p>The 40-metre (133-foot) vessel would normally hold up to 50 people. &quot;It's absurd to put so many people on such a small, old and unseaworthy vessel,&quot; said coastguard captain Ugo D'Atri.</p>
<p>Coastguards mounted a similar rescue on Saturday night when a rusty Albanian patrol boat with 858 people on board ran aground in stormy seas just off the Italian coast.</p>
<p>Refugees have been lodged in makeshift reception centres but hundreds have been moved to other regions to ease the pressure on crowded facilities at Brindisi.</p>
<p>Coastguards in the northern Adriatic port of Ravenna said 24 refugees, including 11 children, had docked on Monday in a cargo ship from the troubled Albanian port of Durres. Several hundred refugees also arrived in the southern port of Otranto.</p>
<p>Italy, which was hit by an exodus of tens of thousands of Albanians in 1991 after communist rule crumbled, has said it will grant refugees only temporary sanctuary and has appealed to other Albanians not to try to follow them.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry said earlier that Italy had flown 36 Albanians who had asked to return home back to Tirana.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano, Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta and Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni met police chiefs in Rome to discuss the situation. Prodi is on a visit to Syria.</p>
