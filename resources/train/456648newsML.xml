<title>BELGIUM: EU to continue cosmetic tests on animals.</title>

<p>The European Union decided on Thursday to extend testing of cosmetics products on animals until June 2000 because there were no other methods, a European Commission spokesman said.</p>
<p>Cosmetic tests on animals were due to be ended in January 1998 under an EU law approved in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;The Commission proposed extending the deadline because valid and recognised alternative tests have not yet been developed,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>But he added that in-vitro testing for eye and skin irritation would be ready by 2000.</p>
<p>The proposal was adopted by the EU Committee on the Adaptation to Technical Progress, chaired by the Commission and made up of officials from the 15 member states.</p>
<p>Animal welfare activists condemned the EU decision saying it meant further suffering for thousands of animals.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shame. The EU is blocking and sabotaging humane legislation,&quot; said Michel Vandenbosch, of the Global Action in the Interest of Animals (GAIA).</p>
<p>Vandenbosch, who said that cosmetics companies could use more than 8,000 existing ingredients to develop new products, was sceptical that animal testing would be banned in 2000.</p>
<p>Britain's Body Shop also condemned the EU decision.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a disgrace. They are ignoring the overwhelming view of people throughout Europe who want these tests banned,&quot; Anita Roddick, The Body Shop's chief executive and founder, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In November, The Body Shop and the European Coalition to End Animal Testing presented the Commission and European Parliament with a petition bearing more than four million signatures, calling for cosmetic tests on animals to be banned from 1998.</p>
