<p>More than 3,500 protesters, defying future ruler China, marched along the main street of Hong Kong on Sunday to mourn Beijing's 1989 bloody crackdown on student-led democracy campaigners.</p>
<p>They waved banners demanding China, which takes over Hong Kong in a month, release jailed dissidents, and some bore a coffin on which was painted &quot;the butcher government will remain notorious for a million years&quot;.</p>
<p>A protest rally on the Sunday before the June 4 anniversary is traditional and this year's turnout was bigger than usual. Tens of thousands are expected at a candlelit vigil on the day itself.</p>
<p>Eight years ago when tank-led troops killed massed, unarmed students in Beijing, a million people, a sixth of Hong Kong's population, poured onto the streets in anger.</p>
<p>Now an advance guard of People's Liberation Army troops is already in barracks in Hong Kong, set for the June 30 handover and pledged to develop &quot;a good image&quot; of the force.</p>
<p>The march reflected public unease as Hong Kong entered its final month under British rule, spurred by a confidence vote from the money markets but still saddled with questions about future freedom under China's red flag.</p>
<p>Business morale in the territory of 6.4 million is at an all time high as Hong Kong counts down to historic changeover.</p>
<p>The territory wrested by military force and &quot;unequal treaties&quot; from the old Celestial Kingdom, will become a Special Administrative Region, retaining a capitalist way life, of the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's stock exchange Hang Seng Index of blue chip shares gained 341-points on Friday to notch a fresh record close of 14,757.81. Turnover was the second highest ever at HK$18.74 billion (US$2.42 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that sentiment is pretty strong heading into the handover,&quot; Howard Gorges, vice-chairman of South China Holdings, said. &quot;It is beginning to look as though 15,000 to 16,000 is the target range for the handover.&quot;</p>
<p>Mixed weather, with sudden rain and sunshine, reflected the mingled emotions of Sunday's protesters who fear the march will be the last of its kind to be permitted.</p>
<p>But they vowed to make further annual protests, even if declared tabooo, despite a warning by China-anointed future leader Tung Chee-hwa to abandon such demonstrations and keep Hong Kong from becoming a base for &quot;foreign subversion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will not be the last time. Next year, the year after and the years after, we will continue to hold commemoration. As long as there is June 4 on the calendar, we will be here,&quot; said the organiser Szeto Wah, chairman of the Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movement in China.</p>
<p>Szeto also said Chinese people would not rest until the military crackdown which killed hundreds was &quot;redressed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As long as there are Chinese in this world, June 4 will not be forgotten.. As long as June 4 is remembered, it will be redressed,&quot; he told the crowd at the start of the march.</p>
<p>The protesters, waving placards with words &quot;Never forget June 4&quot;, demanded that China end single party rule and institute democracy.</p>
<p>The march ended outside the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's unoffical mission in the territory, where demonstrators laid a wreath for the victims and put up a banner that portrayed the Goddess of Democracy, the State of Liberty-type sculpture the Tiananmen students erected.</p>
<p>Beijing has branded the Alliance subversive for its role in helping many dissidents involved in the mainland's democracy movement escape overseas.</p>
