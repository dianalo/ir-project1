<headline>Rubin says odds against Clinton on new trade bill.</headline>

<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Thursday that President Bill Clinton faced an uphill battle to win new trade negotiation authority from Congress and the odds were running against him.</p>
<p>Rubin told an investment group that the administration was trying to work with lawmakers to win support for so-called fast track trade negotiation legislation but that it &quot;is going to be very difficult and the odds clearly are not in our favour.&quot;  </p>
<p>Clinton needs fast track trade authority to negotiate an expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to include Chile and other trade agreements. With fast track, Congress gives up the right to change trade pacts. Lawmakers would be able to accept or reject them, but not amend them.</p>
<p>A dispute between Republicans and Democrats over authority to include labour and environmental issues has delayed consideration of legislation. Republicans, who control Congress, oppose including those issues in trade negotiations, while many key Democrats in Congress refuse to support fast track without that authority.</p>
<p>Rubin told the Investment Company Institute that fast track allows the president to negotiate trade agreements more effectively. But he said support for international engagement was shrinking in Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many who believe that NAFTA could not pass (the U.S. Congress) today,&quot; Rubin said. NAFTA links Canada, Mexico and the United States in a free trade bloc.</p>
