<p>Honeywell Inc sees its China sales rising 20 percent this year from last year's $500 million, aided by growing demand for energy-saving technology for home heating, a senior company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based company expects rising demand for its control systems as China expands use of so-called district heating, or centralised heating and distribution systems, said Sam Hawkins, Honeywell's Asia Pacific president.</p>
<p>&quot;The use of district heating (in China) has taken off in the last few years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many Chinese cities, particularly those north of the Yangtze river, are replacing coal furnaces with centralised heating systems covering large numbers of homes.</p>
<p>This trend has been accelerated by rapid economic growth that has led to the replacement of many smaller dwellings with multi-storey apartment buildings.</p>
<p>China's shift from a centrally planned economy to one based on market principles has also made municipal heating companies more concerned about cutting costs by conserving energy.</p>
<p>Honeywell is looking to sell technology to control boilers and manage the distribution of superheated water used to provide home heating, Hawkins said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are few (system) controls now. If there are controls they are manual,&quot; Hawkins said, adding that that meant wide variations in temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>It also often meant that leaks or breaks in the distribution system could go unnoticed for long periods.</p>
<p>Hawkins said Honeywell was working on a project with the Beijing District Heating Co to improve heating services to 20 percent of the capital city's buildings.</p>
<p>That project, which will reduce dependence on coal furnaces and thereby help lower air pollution levels, has World Bank funding.</p>
<p>Other similar projects were being undertaken in the eastern city of Qingdao and the northern city of Tangshan.</p>
<p>Hawkins estimates the overall market in China for this type of control technology will reach $190 million a year by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Honeywell's sales total in the China market also includes control systems for office buildings and hotels as well as process control technology for industry.</p>
