<title>UK: Propane prices soar on Europe's continued freeze.</title>
<headline>Propane prices soar on Europe's continued freeze.</headline>

<p>European propane prices continued to hit new highs daily as the freezing weather across the continent sent demand soaring, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The level of $400 a tonne was breached on Monday for the first time since the Gulf War, and there was no end seen in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to believe we'll get to $500 a tonne, but then a few weeks ago it was hard to believe it would get to $300&quot;, said a coaster trader. &quot;Whatever price you buy at, it looks good the next day&quot;.</p>
<p>Another cargo trader for a large Scandinavian producer said &quot;I'm willing to bet that we'll see getting on for $500 in a week or two.&quot;</p>
<p>Propane is used as a domestic heating and cooking fuel across much of Europe, especially Spain and Portugal where piped natural gas is not widely available.</p>
<p>On Monday, large cargoes were traded at $388 a tonne cif Le Havre and reportedly at $396 a tonne cif Lavera in the French Mediterranean.</p>
<p>For smaller lots, prices are even higher.</p>
<p>Sellers  of small seagoing ships asked $400 a tonne fob northwest Europe on Tuesday, and a barge trader based in Antwerp said he had already paid $407 a tonne for railcars on Monday. &quot;It's very very high&quot;, he said, &quot;but at least railcars are always running whatever the weather&quot;, pointing out that inland barge movements are likely to be hampered because of ice.</p>
<p>The biggest supplier of propane to the Mediterranean is Algerian Sonatrach. But a trader there said on Tuesday that Sonatrach now has no supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;We maximised all our loadings in December to empty our stocks by the end of the year&quot;, he said. &quot;Ships will now have to wait for more to become available. There will be four or five ships queuing up in early January.&quot;</p>
<p>That left the possibility of importing supplies from outside the region to meet demand.</p>
<p>In theory the price differential between the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe makes this attractive. But in practice, traders said, there were no vessels available from the U.S. Gulf until at least January 10, and even then, loading will take at least seven days as the U.S. product is not fully refrigerated and will have to be cooled before it can be loaded onto transatlantic carriers.</p>
<p>This meant no product could leave the U.S. until the second half of the month, and would not arrive until early February.</p>
<p>Few traders are willing to take this risk for the fear of milder weather by then slashing prices.</p>
<p>Some anticipated supply will be brought in from the Middle East.</p>
<p>On the last day of the month, activity is inevitably thin as the trade awaits the announcement of official selling prices - especially the Saudi Arabian Contract Price - valid for the following month. Saudi sources said that the CP will not be announced until possibly as late as Thursday. Market rumours suggested they were already known, at $330 a tonne for both propane and butane.</p>
<p>But until they become official, European propane prices look set to continue their rise as long as the weather stays cold.</p>
