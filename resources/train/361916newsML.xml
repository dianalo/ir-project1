<headline>Asian crudes little changed in slim trade.</headline>

<p>Asian crude prices were mostly stable in quiet dealings on Thursday with some major markets in the region, including those in Hong Kong and China, closed for the Lunar New Year, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading is very, very thin, and it's going to be even thinner tomorrow,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Markets in Singapore and South Korea, along with China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, will be closed on Friday.</p>
<p>In Indonesian crudes, Minas cargoes were notionally assessed at ICP plus 70 cents for March amid a general expectation of a weaker market.  </p>
<p>February Minas cargoes were mostly traded above ICP plus $1.00.</p>
<p>Firm offers for March Minas were not likely to emerge until after the Chinese New Year holiday, traders said.</p>
<p>Paper Tapis was assessed at $22.90/23.00 for March. In Wednesday trading, it was indicated at around $22.85/22.95.</p>
<p>In Middle Eastern crudes, 200,000 barrels of March Murban cargo were sold to a European major at ADNOC plus 11 cents, in line with recent deals for the Abu Dhabi grade.  </p>
<p>Activity for both Middle Eastern and regional cargoes is expected to pick up next week and to get into full swing the week after, market participants said.</p>
<p>Traders expected regional requirements for April barrels to be smaller than those for March cargoes as several refineries in Japan and South Korea are scheduled to undergo spring maintenance checks in April and early May.</p>
<p>In Japan, four crude distillation units, with a combined processing capacity of 475,200 barrels per day, are planned to be shut for routine maintenance in April.</p>
