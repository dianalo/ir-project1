<headline>Iran's Velayati in Turkey for talks.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in Turkey on Monday for talks aimed partly at defusing a diplomatic row between the neighbouring Moslem countries.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that both countries are determined to put an end to the crisis,&quot; Velayati told reporters at Ankara airport when asked about a dispute that has resulted in diplomats from both countries returning home.</p>
<p>It began when Ankara protested about Iranian ambassador Mohammed Reza Bagheri's presence at an Islamist rally in Ankara in January. Bagheri has since left Turkey.</p>
<p>Last week, Tehran ordered Turkey's ambassador and another Turkish diplomat in the western city of Orumiyeh to leave Iran.</p>
<p>Velayati said Tehran welcomed a Turkish envoy's visit to Iran earlier this month aimed at calming the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;My visit to Turkey is the second positive step between the two countries...two Moslem friendly countries,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course in the past we have had fluctuations, but with the wisdom which exists in both countries we could overcome difficulties in our relations,&quot; Velayati said.</p>
<p>Diplomatic relations between Iran and its secularist neighbour have often been strained but the expulsions created the first row since an Islamist-led government came to power in Ankara last June.</p>
<p>Velayati said he was to invite Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to a summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, being held in Tehran in December.</p>
<p>He was also to meet Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan before leaving Turkey on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Velayati began a 10-day tour with a trip to Damascus on Sunday and was also to visit Sudan, Uganda, the Czech Republic and Gulf Arab states, including Saudi Arabia.</p>
