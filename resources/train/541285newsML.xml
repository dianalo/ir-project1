<p>An emergency special session of the General Assembly is expected to adopt a resolution on Friday condemning and demanding an immediate halt to Israel's construction of a new settlement in East Jerusalem, captured during the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>The draft, sponsored by about 30 mostly Arab and Islamic countries, is likely to be endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the assembly's 185 members, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The 10th emergency assembly -- the first since 1982 -- was convened on Thursday at the request of the Arab group of states under a 1950 procedure allowing an issue considered a threat to peace to be transferred to the assembly if a veto prevents the 15-nation Security Council from taking action.</p>
<p>There is no veto in the assembly, whose resolutions are not binding.</p>
<p>The United States used its veto on March 7 and again on March 21 to block Security Council resolutions calling on Israel not to proceed with the construction of 6,500 homes for Jews at a site between Jerusalem and Bethlehem called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.</p>
<p>While critical of the Israeli building project, the United States said differences between Israel and the Palestinians should be settled in bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p>On March 13, a non-emergency session of the General Asembly voted 130 to 2, with two abstentions, for a resolution calling on Israel to abandon its construction plan.</p>
<p>The latest resolution calls for &quot;the cessation of all forms of assistance and support for illegal Israeli activities&quot; in the occupied territories.</p>
<p>An earlier version, softened to gain the support of more European and other Western countries, would have specifically recommended that &quot;all states prevent the provision of all assistance by their governmental agencies and their nationals to Israeli private or public establishments&quot; involved in settlement activities.</p>
<p>The draft recommends that parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits settlements in occupied territories, &quot;take measures, on a national or regional level ... to ensure respect by Israel&quot; for the convention.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan would be asked to &quot;monitor the situation and to submit a report&quot; within two months. An earlier text would have asked him to send a team of U.N. observers to the area.</p>
<p>Another provision recommends that a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Jerusalem &quot;should include internationally guaranteed provisions to ensure the freedom of religion and of conscience of its inhabitants&quot; as well as &quot;permanent, free and unhindered access to the Holy Places by the faithful of all religions and nationalities.&quot;</p>
<p>A paragraph included at the behest of some Western countries &quot;rejects terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,&quot; in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions.</p>
<p>The resolution calls for the emergency special session to be adjourned &quot;temporarily&quot; but authorises its resumption &quot;upon request from member states.&quot; A previous special session on the question of Palestine in 1980 was resumed four times in the course of 1982.</p>
