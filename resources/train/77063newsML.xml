<p>China, embroiled in a row with Japan over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea, on Wednesday called for a mustering of sufficient military might to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The official China Daily newspaper said combat readiness among the people should be boosted, but diplomats said the rallying call was aimed more at strengthening political control over the armed forces than at warning off Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;We must ensure that we have sufficient force to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,&quot; the newspaper quoted Major-General Dai Yifang of the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Military Sciences as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We must be ready for any possible invasion, pool all social resources, and mobilise all resources to unite the entire country,&quot; it said in a front-page report flanked by a photograph of naval vessels carrying out exercises in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>The photograph was dated September 18, anniversary of the start of Japan's 1931 invasion of northeastern China and one of the most sensitive dates in a Sino-Japanese diplomatic calendar strewn with bitter reminders of past conflict.</p>
<p>Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been rocked in recent months by a flaring dispute over the ownership of a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyus in Chinese and the Senkakus in Japan.</p>
<p>The dispute, fuelled by the construction by rightwing Japanese of a lighthouse on one of the islands, has united Beijing with rival Taiwan in condemnation of Tokyo's control over the potentially resource-rich group.</p>
<p>China on Tuesday told Japan not to provoke any new incidents in the island row, but diplomats said China Daily's paean to Beijing's policy of 'active defence' did not appear intended as a diplomatic shot across Tokyo's bows.</p>
<p>&quot;It's another little push (to stress) that politics rule the military,&quot; said one Beijing-based Western diplomat. &quot;I don't think its directly connected with the islands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying theme has been that the Chinese have been trying to keep the Diaoyu/Senkaku business quite low key,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;It's the Taiwanese and people in Hong Kong that are causing them (the Chinese) problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Japanese patrol vessels on Monday repulsed Hong Kong and Taiwanese activists trying to force a landing on the Diaoyus, but more nationalist campaigners are already en-route for further confrontations in the waters around the islands.</p>
<p>The dispute has forced Beijing to walk a tightrope between maintaining its nationalist credentials and averting a diplomatic crisis with a vital economic partner.</p>
<p>The China Daily article, which was peppered with references to late Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of &quot;people's war&quot;, was a product of continuing campaigns to stress the Communist Party's control of the army, another Beijing-based diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a bit of a throwback to an earlier ideological era,&quot; the diplomat said. &quot;The mood in the military has been pretty conservative in recent months... There has been a renewed emphasis on ideological and political education.&quot;</p>
<p>China Daily said the new high-technology People's Liberation Army still paid special attention to Mao's military thinking, developed during the Communist Party's successful war against its Nationalist rivals and in its resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>One diplomat said the theory would be of little use in a naval confrontation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a people's war when you go to sea, because you can't mass people at sea,&quot; he said. &quot;You've got to fight with what you've got.&quot;</p>
