<title>UK: Euro fuel barges $81/$82 amid holiday torpor.</title>
<headline>Euro fuel barges $81/$82 amid holiday torpor.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE fuel oil barge prices gained $1 on Thursday as the Dutch returned to work, but with most of the rest of Europe on holiday little was done, traders said.</p>
<p>One barge was heard traded at $81.50 fob ARA. Offers were at $82 for start May and $82.50 or $83 further out, a gain of about $1 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>But much of the talk was notional with so many European players off for the May Day break.</p>
<p>Bunker demand was very poor.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole world is closed so there is very little getting done,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Cargo markets were thin, although one player was heard looking to cover a high sulphur short into a utility.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a stand-off on the high sulphur. Nobody is really chasing firm offers,&quot; one purchaser said.</p>
<p>Bids were in the mid $70's while there was talk of offers over $80.</p>
<p>Straight-run was quiet, with no activity predicted until next week. However a Russian M40 was being offered in the Mediterranean.  </p>
<p>Two Gibraltar bunker cargo requirements were believed filled by the same seller on Wednesday with Bilbao barrels, one at a fob price of fob high quotes plus between $1 and $1.50.</p>
