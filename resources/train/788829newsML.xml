<p>NASA officials have made no final decision on a Russian proposal to send U.S. astronaut Michael Foale on a spacewalk to inspect Mir's damaged compartment, a spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The U.S. space agency was caught off guard when Russian flight director Vladimir Solovyov told reporters in Moscow on Thursday that Foale would be making a Sept. 3 spacewalk to inspect the Spektr module rammed by an errant cargo craft.</p>
<p>&quot;No decision has been made regarding Foale's participation in the Sept. 3 spacewalk,&quot; NASA spokesman Rob Navias said.</p>
<p>The involvement of Americans in spacewalks from Mir has been under discussion for weeks, he said.</p>
<p>Navias said he had no idea why the Russians would want Foale to participate in that particular spacewalk.</p>
<p>It had been expected that Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Pavel Vinogradov would make the spacewalk to locate the breach in the module's air-tight hull.</p>
<p>Navias said there were no discussions about Foale assisting in an internal spacewalk planned for Aug. 20 to restore some of the electrical power lost in the orbital collision.</p>
<p>NASA announced last week it was dropping astronaut Wendy Lawrence from the next Mir mission because she was too short to fit into a space suit if she was called upon to help in a spacewalk.</p>
<p>Lawrence's place was taken by David Wolf, who is undergoing a crash course in Russian spacewalking. Foale, who has lived aboard Mir since May, will be relieved by Wolf in September or October.</p>
