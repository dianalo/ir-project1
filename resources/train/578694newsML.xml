<p>Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov said on Tuesday he was ready to stand down most of his rebel army following the peace deal he signed with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday, a Russian news agency said.</p>
<p>The RIA agency quoted Maskhadov telling Chechen community leaders in Moscow that after the deal, under which both leaders pledged never again to resort to force, he now had &quot;carte blanche&quot; to concentrate on the region's many internal problems, notably cracking down on armed bandits and kidnap gangs.</p>
<p>&quot;Before signing the treaty he (Maskhadov) could not stand down the lines and armed units of the Chechen army,&quot; RIA said. &quot;But now...he can fully concentrate on internal Chechen issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Maskhadov, a former Soviet colonel, led a force centred on some 5,000 guerrillas in a 21-month campaign to push tens of thousands of Russian troops out of the mainly Moslem region.</p>
<p>Elected president in January, he pledged on Tuesday to clear Chechnya of armed groups in three months. The region of about one million is awash with weaponry and the leadership has faced challenges to its authority from maverick rebel leaders and bandits who are holding several Russian journalists hostage.</p>
<p>RIA quoted Maskhadov as saying he would retain only a national guard and that this would be confined to barracks.</p>
<p>Despite a ceasefire in August and the withdrawal of the troops Yeltsin sent to crush the region's independence drive in December 1994, Maskhadov had maintained his forces.</p>
<p>The treaty avoided defining whether Chechnya was independent or a region of the Russian Federation. Under the ceasefire terms, that key issue was put on ice until 2001.</p>
<p>But Moscow did commit to building relations with Chechnya &quot;in accordance with...the norms of international law&quot; -- a phrase the Chechen leadership seem happy to present to their domestic audience as a recognition of independence.</p>
<p>Boris Berezovsky, deputy secretary of the Kremlin Security Council who helped draft the treaty, said on Tuesday there was no question of Chechnya seceding. But the deal did aim to shore up Maskhadov's authority against hardline secessionist groups.</p>
<p>Berezovsky told a briefing organised by Interfax news agency that Maskhadov had been in &quot;a tight corner&quot;, between Moscow and hardline rebel commanders.</p>
<p>The treaty, plus a range of economic accords reached on Monday, had now given Maskhadov considerable room for manoevre and Berezovsky said he believed Maskhadov would be able, for example to secure the release of Russian captives in Chechnya.</p>
<p>The Kremlin official said that Yeltsin, who acknowledged the war in Chechen as one of his biggest errors, had gone further than his own negotiating team in extending a helping hand to Maskhadov at the risk of criticism from nationalists in Russia.</p>
<p>The deal, which could be summed up as independence but not separation, might serve as an example across Russia's vast expanses, Berezovsky said, criticising &quot;cruel centralisation&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked if he expected Maskhadov to continue pushing for outright secession Berezovsky said: &quot;Maskhadov well understands the realities.&quot; The Chechen and Russian positions were sharply divided but &quot;a whole host&quot; of compromises were now possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a stable Chechnya,&quot; Berezovsky, a wealthy business magnate, said. &quot;For that we need to pay. And we will pay.&quot;</p>
<p>In Moscow, newspapers focused on ambiguities in the treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;It can be interpreted in very many ways by different forces in Moscow and Grozny,&quot; said the liberal Nezavisimaya Gazeta.</p>
<p>In Chechnya, many local people welcomed the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The document means peace, reconstruction of Grozny and all Chechnya,&quot; Rustam Goigov, 75, said in the capital. &quot;There are no totally independent republics -- all must have mutual links. We have our government and that makes us independent enough.&quot;</p>
