<p>Hungarian oil and gas company MOL Rt, once a patchwork of domestic state-run firms, is reshaping itself into a truly international player, MOL's CEO told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last five years we have advanced 25 years in terms of progress and should repeat the 25-year leap during the next five years,&quot; Zoltan Mandoki said in an interview.</p>
<p>MOL has recently increased its foreign activity to include exploration or commercial interest in more than a dozen countries.</p>
<p>The company's international presence includes oil and gas explorations in Syria, Qatar and Yemen, jointly with large multinational oil companies like Chevron, Swift, McDermott, Amerada Hess and Occidental.</p>
<p>MOL is also in advanced talks to purchase a share in the Adriatic pipeline from the Adriatic through Croatia to Hungary, Mandoki said earlier.</p>
<p>MOL currently operates two petrol stations in the Ukraine, two in Slovakia and four in Romania. Although the latter two will remain the main target countries, MOL also plans a presence in Slovenia and Croatia.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to open more than 10 petrol stations in Croatia this year, mainly in the (Hungarian) border region,&quot; Mandoki said. &quot;But the expansion will not stop there.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hungarian state privatisation agency APV is expected to offer a further stake in MOL, the highest capitalised stock of the Budapest bourse, this year. Foreign oil firms will be prevented from gaining a majority stake to maintain MOL as the &quot;national oil company&quot;.</p>
<p>A 12 to 18 percent stake is likely to be offered at the end of the first quarter. Altogether between 28 and 33 percent will be sold to financial investors and a yet-to-be-decided stake offered to MOL staff.</p>
<p>In the first sale of MOL shares in 1995 some 19 percent of the integrated oil and gas giant was sold in 1995 to foreign investors, mainly from Britain and the U.S. while employees subscribed 5.5 percent, the company's managers 0.5 and domestic investors some three percent.</p>
<p>Under the privatisation law the state will permanently maintain a stake of 25 percent plus one golden share ensuring special voting rights</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Mandoki said he did not think the remaining state influence would conflict with private investors' interests.</p>
<p>&quot;The state as owner is just as interested in having a properly working and profitable company as any other owner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The aim of the present overhaul of MOL was to achieve true integration, Mandoki said.</p>
<p>&quot;One cannot have three different levels of financial, accounting or human resources activities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Integration of the information flow up to executive level was one of the critical elements of restructuring, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had to integrate barely compatible local information structures into a single, business-oriented structure,&quot; Mandoki said.</p>
<p>Despite being the country's largest oil and gas company, MOL faces difficulties in keeping its best-trained middle managers, Mandoki said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our wages are not competitive with those offered by either the multinationals present in Hungary, or those of the financial sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mandoki said the MOL workforce needs further trimming and this would primarily affect white-collar workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Petrol station employees excluded, the white collar-blue collar ratio is roughly one to one,&quot; he said. &quot;I think this is unacceptable for a company that is a primarily a production company.&quot;</p>
<p>An overhaul that has brought down the workforce to 14,500 from 23,000 since 1992 will continue during the next five years, he said, with a 10 percent reduction this year.</p>
