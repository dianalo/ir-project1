<p>Russia's new Defence Council met on Friday to tackle a cash crisis in the armed forces, but the country's most prominent soldier snubbed the meeting and it ended with serious differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said the military argued that cash shortages were undermining Russia's defence capabilities. The government said the army was too big, with too many generals and too much bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking intensively for ways to reorganise the armed forces in a way which is profitable from an economic point of view,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Defence Council secretary Yuri Baturin as saying.</p>
<p>Some changes have already been made. The Defence Ministry said on Friday that Yeltsin had sacked several senior generals and Russian media said the move showed new minister Igor Rodionov, appointed in July, was ready for action.</p>
<p>Rodionov is a member of the Defence Council, set up by President Boris Yeltsin in July to oversee military reforms and as a counterbalance to the Security Council. National security adviser Alexander Lebed is its secretary.</p>
<p>Lebed rang alarm bells last month with a warning that soldiers could mutiny if their wages were not paid, but he did not attend the Defence Council meeting -- a clear sign of dissatisfaction with his limited role in the new body.</p>
<p>Friday's closed-door meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a potential rival of Lebed for the presidency should Yeltsin be unable to continue in office.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old president on Thursday told the government to resolve cash problems in the army, where many soldiers have not been paid for months.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia must have a modern and professional army,&quot; Yeltsin said in a radio address from the Central Clinical Hospital, where he is getting ready for heart surgery. &quot;Serving in it must be a source of respect and prestige. Both for the man in the ranks and to the officer. We will achieve this.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin has been gradually delegating power to Chernomyrdin as he prepares for the operation to improve blood supply to his heart.</p>
<p>He spoke to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by telephone on Friday and asked for German backing for efforts by the Russian city of St Petersburg to host the 2004 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin was representing Russia at a summit of leaders of former Soviet states in the Kazakh capital Almaty later on Friday. The leaders will discuss troubled Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, but pulled out after a bloody nine-year war.</p>
<p>Much of Afghanistan is now under the control of the Islamic Taleban militia, although ethnic Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum holds several provinces in the north of the country.</p>
<p>Lebed, who has warned that failure to act in Afghanistan could have serious implications for Russian security, is also fiercely opposed to the expansion of the Western NATO alliance.</p>
<p>He is due to travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels this weekend. It will be the first time the bass-voiced security chief has travelled to the West -- he has said in the past that he knew too many military secrets to be allowed to travel.</p>
<p>Lebed's main achievement since Yeltsin brought him into his administration between the two rounds of the Russian presidential election has been a peace deal with separatist rebels in the southern region of Chechnya.</p>
<p>Separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev met Chernomyrdin on Thursday and they agreed to set up a new joint body to rebuild Chechnya's war-torn economy and organise local elections there.</p>
<p>Fighting has largely stopped in the Caucasus region since the peace deal, but eight people were killed and 24 injured there when a military helicopter crashed late on Thursday. A group of rebel fighters helped take the wounded to hospital.</p>
