<headline>Judge denies King assassin's liver transplant bid.</headline>
<dateline>NASHVILLE, Tenn. 1997-06-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>A judge  on Monday turned down a request by James Earl Ray, convicted assassin of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., for tests that could lead to a life-saving liver transplant.</p>
<p>Chancery Court Judge Irwin Kilcrease sided with the state of Tennessee which said prison officials did not have authority under state law to allow the 69-year-old Ray to travel to another state for a medical evaluation.  </p>
<p>Ray's lawyer, William Pepper, said he would appeal the ruling, adding: &quot;To refuse him this treatment will be doing nothing less than to impose the death penalty on him.&quot;</p>
<p>Ray, who suffers from terminal liver disease, had sought to be allowed to travel to the University of Pittsburgh for an evaluation that could have led to a liver transplant.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are they afraid to let this man live? What is it they fear? Why do they have to react in lock step this way when there's nothing the state of Tennessee can lose?&quot; Pepper asked in court.</p>
<p>Ray confessed to killing King 29 years ago but later denied it and is serving a 99-year sentence. Tests were recently conducted on the gun he allegedly used, in his bid to win a trial to prove that someone else was the assassin. The test results have not been released.</p>
