<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Monday.</p>
<p>LONDON - London's FTSE 100 ended nearly unchanged, as a strong start on Wall Street helped lift British shares from an initial deficit, dealers said. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,810.7, down 2.1 points, or 0.04 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's DAX index surged in late dealings to break the psychologically-important 4,000 point level as a firmer dollar and Wall Street gains gave the German market fresh energy as uncertainity evaporated. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,972.84, up 30.31 points, or 0.77 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,003.35, up 56.62 points, or 1.43 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares closed 0.45 percent higher after a weaker start as a stronger Wall Street cancelled out the effect of an easier dollar, brokers said. The CAC-40 index closed up 13.18, or 0.45 percent, at 2,947.66.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares gained speed after a slow start to post their fourth consecutive record close due to massive gains in most major banks and pharmaceutical company Roche. The Swiss market index closed at 5,947.0, up 100.5 points, or 1.72 percent.</p>
<p>MILAN - Shares surged on EMU euphoria along with Italian bond futures with the all-share Mibtel index ending at a new all-time high above 13,800 and the Mib30 blue chip index above 21,020 but just off a historic 21,028 peak. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 13,804, up 196 points, or 1.44 percent.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Shares trundled to their fourth consecutive record high close, sweeping away fresh intra day highs as retail investors continued to clamour for stock. The AEX index closed at 918.85, up 11.66 points, or 1.29 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong blue chips ended with modest gains as shares in HSBC Holdings Plc powered ahead to a record high, but property market uncertainty returned to plague share prices which ended off the day's highs. The Hang Seng index closed at 14,858.58, up 35.61 points, or 0.24 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended modestly lower, dragged down by profit-taking of blue chips amid signs of strength in the yen against the dollar and also by weakness in construction and banking issues after a medium-sized construction firm's decision to apply for court protection on Friday. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19,705.17, down 262.83 points, or 1.32 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares closed lower, led by declines in the gold sector and other resource stocks but trade was quiet as many players waited for U.S. markets to re-open after the July 4 holiday. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,713.0, down 20.4 points, or 0.75 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - The sliding bullion price gave local gold stocks a hammer blow that reverberated into the wider market, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7,293.2, down 74.8 points, or 1.02 percent. The All Gold index closed at 903.9, down 48.2 points, or 0.67 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 8,743.0, down 58.9 points, or 5.06 percent.</p>
