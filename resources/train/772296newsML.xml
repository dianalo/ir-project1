<p>Peruvian consumer prices rose 0.83 percent  in July, compared with a 1.37 percent rise in the same month last  year and a 1.09 percent rise in June, the government's statistics  agency said Friday.</p>
<p>Consumer prices increased 5.00 percent in the first seven months of  the year, compared with 7.84 percent in the same period last year,  the National Institute for Statistics and Information (INEI) announced  in the official gazette, El Peruano.  </p>
<p>Wholesale prices rose 0.30 percent in July, compared with a 0.69 percent  rise in June, the INEI said without giving a comparative figure for  July 1996.</p>
<p>Wholesale inflation for the first seven months of the year was 2.85  percent, the INEI said, without giving a comparative figure.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected a consumer inflation figure for July of between  0.7 percent and 1.0 percent.  </p>
<p>The government was set to publish details of July's price rises later  Friday.  Leading local consultancy firm Apoyo said the month's inflation  was led by climbs in the prices of food and domestic services.</p>
<p>Consumer prices in Peru rose 11.8 percent in 1996, compared with a  10.2 percent rise in 1995.</p>
<p>In 1996, accumulated inflation for wholesale prices was 11.4 percent,  up from 8.80 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>The government estimates accumulated consumer inflation will be nine  percent this year and will drop to &quot;the level of industrialized countries&quot;  by 2000.</p>
