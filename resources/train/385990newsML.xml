<p>Luc De Bruyckere, chief executive officer of Belgian meat products maker Ter Beke NV, said on Tuesday the outbreak of swine fever in pig farms in the Netherlands and Germany was unjustifiably pushing up pork prices in Belgium.</p>
<p>&quot;It is starting to affect our supplies in terms of price,&quot; De Bruckere told Reuters in a telephone interview. &quot;The Belgian market is not yet touched by the fever but people are very concerned...and on an emotional basis prices have gone up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no economic reason (for the price rises) because there is enough pork on the market for the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Belgium has so far taken the precautionary step of slaughtering 12,000 pigs imported from the Netherlands, where outbreaks of swine fever have been reported.</p>
<p>&quot;That's nothing because there are more than eight million pigs in Belgium. There should not be an economic impact,&quot; he said. Ter Beke sources all its pork in Belgium.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no volume problems. Not at all even. There's plenty of it but the tendency for the price is to go up,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>First half 1996 results had been dented by price rises in pork and poultry because of the scare over mad cow disease. De Bruyckere said that by the end of 1996 prices had returned to normal levels.</p>
<p>Ter Beke will release full-year 1996 figures around mid-March.</p>
