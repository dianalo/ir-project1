<headline>Israeli bonds higher on hopes for a rate cut.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>Israeli bonds rose on Monday on continued expectations of a cut in interest rates and lower yields in the face of tightening supply, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.03 pct to 106.99</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.03 pct to 106.90</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: +0.09 pct to 107.79</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.14 pct to 105.82</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.06 pct to 106.25</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was 163 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;The public is expecting a cut in interest rates and is piling into the unlinked bonds,&quot; said Dany Shamir of Israel Discount Bank. &quot;Prices rose also on medium-term and long-term CPI-linked bonds because if there is a rate cut this is where gains are made.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank's key base rate has been 13.9 percent since February. The Bank of Israel is scheduled to announce July rates on June 23.</p>
<p>But some traders said they do not believe Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel would lower interest rates this month.</p>
<p>&quot;He won't lower interest rates in coming months. Interest rates are reasonable at the moment,&quot; said an investment manager at one of the banks.</p>
<p>Shamir said expectations of lower inflation also increased demand for the unlinked bonds. &quot;Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months are at around nine percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But expectations of falling yields due to a tighter supply of bonds also affected trading on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury supply is gradually drying up. The Treasury is issuing fewer CPI-linked bonds than it is redeeming, which is pushing prices up,&quot; said Shamir.</p>
<p>Three months of budget surpluses and increased privatisation revenues have helped reduce government debt needs, traders said.</p>
<p>Shamir said the fact that Monday's new issues had been &quot;pretty well snapped up&quot; reflected expectations both of a rate cut and fears of a scarce supply.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank today issued 150 million shekels worth of 15-year CPI-linked bonds and 75 million shekels worth of six-year CPI-linked bonds. Their yields closed at market price and below market price, respectively,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prices of dollar-linked bonds closed lower after the dollar weakened abroad and in Israel, traders said. The shekel's representative rate was fixed sharply higher against the dollar on Monday after the U.S. currency sagged in Asian trading. The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.4010 shekels, against 3.4150 on Friday.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
