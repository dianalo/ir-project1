<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Tsumeb sees mediation in strike next week.</title>
<headline>Tsumeb sees mediation in strike next week.</headline>

<p>Gold Fields Namibia Ltd said on Friday it hoped for mediation efforts to resolve a month-old strike by the end of next week at its Tsumeb Corp Ltd (TCL) unit.</p>
<p>&quot;I would imagine it will be Thursday or Friday next week,&quot; a company spokesman told Reuters from Namibia.</p>
<p>The Mineworkers' Union of Namibia, whose members are striking over pay, is due to get back to mediators by the end of today, paving the way for full mediation next week.</p>
<p>Production at TCL's three mines and smelters remains at a standstill.</p>
<p>The company said the Tsumeb mine was flooding and underground equipment was being salvaged where possible. At Kombat and Otjihase, pumping was satisfactory.</p>
<p>The company had started repairs on the copper smelter, damaged after strikers took over the site, before the compnay regained control. Repair work was expected to take six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>The strike was costing TCL some 80 tonnes a day in lost copper production and a similar amount in lost lead.</p>
<p>The lead smelter appeared undamaged, but would still take two to three weeks to restart.</p>
<p>TCL produced just under 30,000 tonnes of blister copper last year and 27,000 tonnes of lead. Most of the lead was produced from bought-in material while copper output was from TCL mines.</p>
<p>The mines and smelters have been shut down since August 23. Since then 1,000 non-striking workers have returned to work, but some 1,500 workers are still out on strike.</p>
