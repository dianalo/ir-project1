<title>UK: London gold in doldrums after U.S. rate rise.</title>
<headline>London gold in doldrums after U.S. rate rise.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold was weaker and market sentiment soggy on Wednesday morning following Tuesday's sharp price declines on the rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $346.80 per ounce, compared with $349.60 on Tuesday afternoon and a London close of $348.95/$349.95.</p>
<p>General selling helped depress prices as low as $346.10 in early Europe, dealers said.</p>
<p>But good physical offtake was cushioning gold's descent, and prices had come off the lows, they added.</p>
<p>So far the $346.00 level was holding, but strong support was expected at $345.30, the recent low from March 18.</p>
<p>Gold slid below the psychological $350 level amid options-related and speculative selling on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. interest rate rise of 25 basis points then depressed prices further.</p>
<p>&quot;While the 0.25 percent rate hike by the Fed was fully expected by the market, it still contributed to losses in gold,&quot; brokers GNI said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;While there was some expectation of a 'buy the fact' rally, when it did not come there was general selling.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically gold was in the doldrums and might be headed for the February low of $336, GNI added.</p>
<p>Other precious metals were also weak and vulnerable to further downside tests, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver was last indicated at $5.09/$5.10, down three cents and near the very bottom of its recent range.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pegging support at $5.08. But so far it looks reluctant to follow gold lower,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Some dealers said they would not be surprised to see a test of $5.05 and possibly $5.00 if silver came under speculative pressure again.</p>
<p>&quot;The uptrend has run out of steam and the critical support at 510 cents looks threatened now,&quot; said analyst Elli Gifford.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices need to recover to levels over 530 cents at least if the risk of a breakdown coming through is to reduce,&quot; Gifford said in an Investment Research of Cambridge commentary.</p>
<p>Platinum fixed at $372.00 an ounce, down $2.75 from the previous fixing and the lowest fix since February 21.</p>
<p>Palladium was also fixed lower at $144.50, versus $146.00 on Tuesday afternoon. The rare white metals had dropped sharply on Tuesday following news that strikes at Russian producer Norilsk were being postponed.</p>
