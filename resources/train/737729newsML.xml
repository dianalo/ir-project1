<p>Shenzhen's hard currency B share index reversed morning losses to close higher on Thursday due to selective demand for stocks expected to post satisfactory 1997 interim results, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index gained 0.91 points or 0.68 percent to 133.64 points after hitting an intraday low of 132.22 on turnover of HK$46 million, compared with Wednesday's HK$39 million.</p>
<p>The domestic A share index advanced 5.54 points or 1.35 percent to 415.13 points due to institutional buying, brokers said. Turnover in the A share market was 6.8 billion yuan agianst 7.1 billion on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Buying was focused on stocks likely to generate good interim results,&quot; an analyst at a major Chinese brokerage said.</p>
<p>Investors were paying more attention to first-half earnings during the 1997 interim corporate reporting season which would end on August 30, analysts said.</p>
<p>Many, however, refrained from heavy trading, they said.</p>
<p>An article published in China's Business News on Wednesday said Chinese investors should be wary of the interim results because they were unaudited and did not represent a full year's performance.  </p>
<p>The Guotai analyst said the B share index had entered a period of consolidation.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected the B share index to trend higher on Friday after mild corrections for two straight sessions.</p>
<p>In the B share market, Nanjing Posts &amp; Telecommunications Co Ltd rose HK$0.12 to HK$3.70 on volume of 1.37 million shares, making it the second most actively traded stock.</p>
<p>Investors expected robust interim profits from the company, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Newcomer Beijing Yanjing Brewery Co Ltd, which listed 72 million A shares on Wednesday, surged 1.52 yuan to its 10 percent limit-up at 16.72 yuan on Thursday.</p>
<p>Volume reached 19 million shares, making it the most actively traded A share.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors snapped up Yanjing, China's biggest brewery, because they were optimistic about the company's outlook.</p>
