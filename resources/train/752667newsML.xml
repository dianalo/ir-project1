<title>BRAZIL: Brazil limits Anheuser-Busch, Antartica beer pact.</title>
<headline>Brazil limits Anheuser-Busch, Antartica beer pact.</headline>

<p>Brazil's anti-trust watchdog has set limits on an association between local brewer Antartica Paulista and the world's biggest brewer, Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, an official said.</p>
<p>The official at Cade, the Administrative Economic Defense Council, said the two companies would have to dissolve their partnership in the Brazilian market in two years.</p>
<p>&quot;The council reached a definitive decision yesterday (Wednesday), voting 5-2, that the association would have to be dissolved in two years,&quot; the official told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The official added, however, that the council had indicated it could reevaluate its decision if Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser, and Antartica, Brazil's second largest brewer, altered some &quot;anti-competition&quot; clauses in their contract.</p>
<p>The Cade ruling echoed its decision in early June on a deal between South America's largest brewer Brahma and U.S giant Miller, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc.</p>
<p>The official said it was also &quot;imaginable&quot; that it would influence a decision expected soon on a pact between Carlsberg A/S and Skol Breweries Ltd.  </p>
<p>He said the Anheuser-Antartica anti-competition clauses referred to included, among others, such items as price controls and exclusivity clauses.</p>
<p>Cade gave a preliminary ruling on the partnership a month ago.</p>
<p>Once a largely toothless body bossed around by the Finance Ministry, Cade has recently been flexing its muscles and vetoing major corporate mergers.</p>
