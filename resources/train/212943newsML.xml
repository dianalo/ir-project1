<p>China's rulers on Sunday concluded a top-level meeting on the economy in Beijing by lauding the country's success in reining in inflation and vowing to push ahead with reforms of the state sector in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;China's macro-economic control with the curbing of inflation as the primary task has met the pre-set target,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and the country's top economic planner Zhu Rongji attended the four-day conference to review this year's economic performance and chart the course of development for 1997, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>China would continue with a moderately tight monetary policy to try to keep a cap on inflation, which has been Beijing's top priority in setting economic policy over the past several years, the agency said.</p>
<p>Official forecasts say inflation in 1996 will be about 6.5 percent in 1996, down from last year's 14.8 percent and 1994's communist-era high of 21.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Work will continue to readjust and control the range of price rises and lower the growth rate of prices,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>&quot;A good macro-economic environment and standardised economic order should be maintained, adhering to a moderately tight financial and monetary control.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials said tackling the sensitive issue of reform of loss-making state firms would be a priority for next year's economic development.</p>
<p>&quot;Reform and development of state-owned enterprises must be accelerated, and economic efficiency of enterprises must be vigorously improved,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>About 70 percent of China's hundreds of thousands of state firms are running in the red, 40 percent with chronic deficits, official statistics show.</p>
<p>Beijing has been reluctant to push ahead with reform of the wheezing state sector, fearing that mass unemployment and loss of cradle-to-grave welfare could spark social unrest.</p>
<p>The meeting also pledged to forge ahead with agricultural reforms and continue an opening up policy launched by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>&quot;Opening to the outside world represents a basic policy of the country and must be pursued unswervingly over a long period,&quot; it added.</p>
