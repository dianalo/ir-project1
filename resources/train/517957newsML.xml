<p>Germany has yet to appreciate fully the role of the equity market in developing an investment culture and freeing up venture capital to generate new jobs, the German share institute (DAI) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>At its annual meeting, the DAI said that changes in the way Germans will pay for their pensions and an increased need for venture capital will push equities to the centre of the investment stage, and the right regulatory background was needed to support this.</p>
<p>&quot;The increasing globalisation of capital markets and efforts to encourage larger sections of the population to invest in shares require an increased focus on regulation in the capital markets,&quot; Helmut Loehr, chairman of the DAI and Bayer AG management board member said.</p>
<p>Loehr said the introduction of shareholder value-creating instruments, where the emphasis is on providing return for an investor, would help to win the confidence of investors.</p>
<p>The traditional image of the German investor as shy of  risk and only interested in bonds is changing.</p>
<p>A key factor in this was the flotation of the first 20-billion mark ($12 billion) tranche of Deutsche Telekom last November, which saw German investors flock to invest in the state telecommuncations company.</p>
<p>Statistics from fund management groups also show that the share is becoming a more acceptable investment vehicle in Germany, as share-backed investment funds register strong rates of growth among new investors.</p>
<p>Recent figures from Dresdner Bank's investment group DBI showed that 70 percent of investments in funds in the early part of 1997 went into equity funds, which also provided the highest returns in the period.</p>
<p>The DAI said that changes in the German pension system towards private provision would help both individuals and the state.</p>
<p>Pension provision is high on the political agenda at the moment, with debate on the issue centred on whether the current system, which is dominated by pay-as-you-go government schemes, will have to supplemented with a funded pension system and just how this could be brought about.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital markets, and in particular equities, can help to better provide for the needs of the ageing population,&quot; Loehr said.</p>
<p>Growth in pension funds would help to develop Germany's venture capital sector, often seen as somewhat inflexible compared with countries like the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;Pension funds would free up considerable amounts of capital, boosting the amounts of capital available to the German economy, especially for small-to-medium sized companies,&quot; Loehr said.</p>
<p>Loehr cited the British example, where 45 percent of venture capital comes from pension funds, which helps to create jobs while simulataneously reducing the state's exposure to pension payouts.</p>
<p>In the United States venture capital funds were involved with around 8,000 companies, which have generated 200,000 new jobs, Loehr said.</p>
