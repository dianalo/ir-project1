<p>Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet said in a statement on Thursday the Bank had no plans to change its intervention rate any time soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The Monetary Policy Council considers that our rate for repurchase tenders is presently at the appropriate level in view of the French and international economic environment. The Council has no plans at this stage to change this rate at its upcoming meetings.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Bank of France on Thursday cut its intervention rate to 3.10 percent from 3.15 percent after a meeting of its monetary policy council.</p>
<p>Trichet said in the statement that this was the lowest the intervention rate has ever been.</p>
<p>He added that it was the right time to invest in France.</p>
<p>&quot;The monetary and financial conditions are ripe for sustained economic growth and job creation. It is the right time for businesses and households to invest,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Trichet also said the cut in the intervention rate on Thursday was meant to send a signal of confidence in the franc.</p>
<p>&quot;In making this move, the Monetary Policy Council wished to send a signal of confidence as part of its monetary strategy for the credibility and stability of the French franc amongst the most credible European currencies.&quot;</p>
