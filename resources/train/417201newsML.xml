<p>Diamond giant De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd posted strong year results on Tuesday as its earnings per share rose to 354 U.S. cents from 259 cents.</p>
<p>The group also increased its dividend by 10.5 percent to 102.7 U.S. cents a share.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected a good set of results following on from a sparkling performance at the half year in August and record sales in 1996 by its Central Selling Organisation (CSO), which controls some 75 percent of the rough-diamond market.</p>
<p>De Beers said diamond demand remained strong with good sales reported at the first two so-called &quot;sights&quot; of 1997, where the CSO sells to a select group of traders.</p>
<p>Market watchers say the firm is also reaping benefits from its investments in other firms like Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd and Minorco.</p>
<p>Total combined earnings, including the share of retained associates' earnings, were $1,344 million, up fom $986 million.</p>
<p>This included an exceptional profit of $109 million from the disposal of a portion of its interest in industrial holding firm Johnnic.</p>
<p>Excluding associates', earnings totalled $828 million against $624 million, while the diamond account for the year totalled $803 million compared to $760 million.</p>
<p>De Beers shares rose after the news was announced to a new year high of 159.75 cents before closing down 50 cents on the day at 157.00 on some profit-taking.</p>
<p>De Beers said it had held &quot;constructive&quot; talks with the Russian diamond authorities with a view to resume a contractual relationship following a stand-off late last year which unnerved the world diamond market.</p>
