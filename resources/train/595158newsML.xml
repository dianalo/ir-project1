<p>The U.N. Libya sanctions committee concluded on Monday that flights by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to Niger and Nigeria earlier this month were a breach of sanctions, committee chairman Zbigniew Wlosowicz of Poland said.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after a closed meeting, he said the committee also took note of explanations by Libya, Niger and Nigeria that the flights were for religious purposes.</p>
<p>The committee's findings will be submitted to the Security Council, which will discuss the matter during closed-door consultations on Tuesday, Wlosowicz added.</p>
<p>Libya has been subject to mandatory U.N. sanctions since 1992, including a ban on international flights and an arms embargo, for failing to extradite two men wanted by Britain and the United States in the 1988 mid-air bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.</p>
<p>A flotilla of four Libyan aircraft recently flew Gaddafi and others to Niger and Nigeria, and back to Libya, despite the U.N. ban.</p>
<p>Libya said Gaddafi visited the West African countries to hold prayers marking the Moslem new year as head of the Islamic Popular Leadership, an organisation he created in 1989.</p>
<p>Committee members said it would be up to the council to decide what action to take.</p>
<p>One possibility is a council statement condemning Libya's action and reminding the other countries that, under the sanctions regime, they are required to deny landing rights to Libyan aircraft.</p>
<p>The Security Council issued a statement on April 4 rapping Libya for flying pilgrims from Libya to Saudi Arabia in breach of sanctions.</p>
<p>It was the third consecutive year Libya had violated sanctions by flying pilgrims to Jeddah on an unauthorised flight even though the council had given permission for an Egyptian airline to ferry Libyans wishing to make the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
