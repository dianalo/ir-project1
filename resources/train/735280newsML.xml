<p>Britain's financial markets regulator, the Securities and Futures Authority, on Thursday said stockbroking firm Teather &amp; Greenwood is to pay 60,000 stg in fines and costs over internal controls and compliance failures in its corporate finance business.</p>
<p>The SFA said Eric Kenelm Ford, a partner in the firm and head of corporate finance since May 1995, is to pay a fine and costs amounting to 10,000 stg.</p>
<p>The regulator said Teather &amp; Ford admitted its failure to pay proper attention to compliance and controls throughout 1993 and 1994 which led to conflicts of interest in share placings when staff in corporate finance were also dealing for private clients.</p>
<p>It also failed to keep proper records of customers, their investment objectives and suitability for certain investments and advice given to customers.</p>
<p>In addition the firm has admitted it failed to supervise the corporate finance activities of two staff and failed to ensure that fees paid are paid to the firm and entered in its books.</p>
<p>The SFA said Ford had admitted allowing a potential conflict of interest to arise and failed to keep proper records as to investment advice given to his clients and their circumstances and risk profiles.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the SFA said it had taken into account the fact that the firm has conducted a full review of its procedures and has implemented a remedial plan. Neither Teather &amp; Greenwood nor Ford have been the subject of previous SFA disciplinary action.</p>
<p>The regulator also pointed out that no client of the brokerage had been disadvantaged.</p>
