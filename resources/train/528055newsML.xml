<p>China's securities authorities will consider allowing 32 state firms which once issued shares without approval to list the shares on the stock markets, the Shanghai Securities News said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) will review the companies and allow those found qualified to be listed, while those found to be ineligible must buy back the shares, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Thousands of Chinese state-run firms issued shares, mainly to their staff, in the late 1980s and early 1990s without approval. At the time, there was virtually no securities regulatory framework in existence.</p>
<p>Beijing banned most of the firms involved from listing their shares, but in 1993 named 100 as candidates for listings, 68 of which have since had their shares listed on either the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges.</p>
<p>The remaining 32 were passed over for various reasons, but their cases will now be reviewed again, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It did not name the companies, and gave no further details.</p>
