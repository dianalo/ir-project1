<p>Lithuania's jubliant right-wing, returning to power after four years in opposition, faces a tough task of convincing the world it has a credible programme of economic reform, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Results of Sunday's second round of parliamentary elections showed the Homeland Union of former prime minister Vytautas Landsbergis just short of an outright majority but able to dominate the likely coalition with Christian Democrats.</p>
<p>Replacing the outgoing ex-communists of the Lithunian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP), the Homeland's next task is to create an economic programme that will allow the country to catch up with other Central and East European states.</p>
<p>&quot;The question mark must now be over their economic policy,&quot; said one Western diplomat.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union's candidate for prime minister, and main economist, Gediminas Vagnorius, has a checkered record.</p>
<p>During a stint as prime minsiter in 1991 to 1992, he got privatisation off to a good start.</p>
<p>But later, when in opposition, he proposed a plan to index savings retrospectively, a move which would have caused havoc with state finances and exacerbated inflation.</p>
<p>Vagnorius also alarmed foreign investors and Lithuanians alike after the first round of elections on October 20 by saying he wanted to get rid of Lithuania's currency peg to the dollar, even though he denied he was considering a devaluation.</p>
<p>He has since retreated from his position that the peg, set at four to one dollar and run under a currency board system, must go at the start of next year and favours a longer time frame of around 18 months.</p>
<p>He also pledged to listen to the Interantional Monetary Fund's advice when modifying the currency system. The Fund has opposed an early switch out of the currency board.</p>
<p>&quot;My main worry is that they do not have the experience, it is a problem of personnel,&quot; said one senior financial analyst.</p>
<p>The other main question mark is on how strong is the proclaimed commitment to privatisation and attracting foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the challenge,&quot; one Western diplomat said. &quot;They (the Homeland Union) now have to put into effect the brave words that they spoke at election time.&quot;</p>
<p>Vagnorius has said he wants to sell off the large state companies which the LDLP never put up for sale. But the Homeland Union also has expressed some fears over foreign take-overs and investment, and analysts said they were anxious to see if the privatisation pledges were kept.</p>
<p>Lithuania is seen as lagging its Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Estonia in economic reforms and foreign investment, partly due to the reluctance of the LDLP to sell off attractive state firms such as the airline and telecommunications.</p>
