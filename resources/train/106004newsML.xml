<p>Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley on Wednesday announced a new crackdown on welfare fraud and an initiative to harness the private sector to get 100,000 single mothers back to work.</p>
<p>In a speech to the ruling Conservatives' annual conference, Lilley said he would introduce a bill to make it easier for the government to check up on welfare cheats.</p>
<p>At the moment, he said, unintended barriers prevent the government from cross-checking information it has about people's income tax, VAT and benefit claims. &quot;That's absurd. So I shall bring in a bill to allow us to check up on the cheats,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He also wants to set up a Fraud Inspectorate to investigate local authorities that are slow to tackle housing benefit fraud, in order to make councils take the issue seriously.</p>
<p>The plan for single mothers aims to help them escape the benefit trap. A pilot scheme will be launched in 12 areas.</p>
<p>Lilley said for the first time the private sector would be involved in helping people move off welfare and into work.</p>
<p>&quot;Private firms will compete with Government teams. They will be paid by results. So they will only make a profit if they succeed in helping people back to work, keeping them in work, and saving the taxpayer money,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>On Europe, Lilley continued the theme of the conference by appealing for the party to unite behind Prime Minister John Major's wait-and-see stance on a single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sick and tired of Conservatives who fuel the media by sniping at their colleagues. In two minutes they can undo all the good work you, the party workers, have done in a year.</p>
<p>&quot;So let's turn our fire on Labour. And support John Major,&quot; Lilley, one of the cabinet's Euro-sceptics, said.</p>
