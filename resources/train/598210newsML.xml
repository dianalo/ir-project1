<title>USA: New York passenger sues TWA over missed flight.</title>
<headline>New York passenger sues TWA over missed flight.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A New York City man has filed a $6.5 million lawsuit against Trans World Airlines, claiming the airline had him removed from a flight and kept him from saying farewell to his dying father in Israel.</p>
<p>Security guards removed Reouven Barzilai, a jazz club owner, from a TWA flight in a dispute over smoking, he said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of TWA's actions, by the time I reached my father he was already in a coma and I could no longer talk to him,&quot; Barzilai said.</p>
<p>Barzilai, a smoker, said he booked a seat on TWA Flight 884 on Jan. 22 from New York's Kennedy International Airport because he believed it was a smoking flight. But as he boarded, he said TWA announced smoking would not be permitted.</p>
<p>Barzilai's attorney Michael Wolin said an attendent asked his client to leave the plane and called airport security when he refused. &quot;He never smoked on the plane, he never created a disturbance. He's a very quiet man,&quot; the lawyer said.</p>
<p>Wolin said Barzalai was charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. A day later, a Queens Criminal Court judge dismissed the case, the lawyer said.</p>
<p>TWA spokesman John McDonald said from the airline's St. Louis headquarters, said, &quot;He has never complained directly to the airline regarding his allegations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Further, TWA has not yet received the lawsuit nor has had time to review it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court last week, Barzilai is seeking $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.</p>
