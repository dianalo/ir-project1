<p>Sri Lanka's largest financial institution, the Development Finance Corp of Ceylon, transformed itself into a bank on Wednesday and said it planned to expand.</p>
<p>Announcing the change and a new identity -- DFCC Bank -- general manager and chief executive Moksevi Prelis told Reuters the group's operations had turned around and would make increased profits in the current financial year.</p>
<p>He said the bank's fortunes had improved with a recent upturn in the Sri Lankan economy, which had boosted industrial investment in the Indian Ocean island and demand for credit.</p>
<p>&quot;This year will certainly be better than last year,&quot; Prelis said in an interview. &quot;We can already see the signs.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, DFCC reported a net profit of 119 million rupees ($2 million) for its first quarter to June 30, up 29 percent year-on-year. The improvement was achieved on a quarterly income of 643 million rupees, against 554 million rupees the year before.</p>
<p>DFCC deputy general manager for finance Subramaniam Nagarajah said the institution had faced a difficult year in 1996/97, partly due to a nationwide drought, which led to lengthy power cuts across industry.</p>
<p>Asked if DFCC could match the 1995/96 total net profit of 590 million rupees, Nagarajah replied: &quot;I would say we will strive to better it.&quot;</p>
<p>Prelis said the bank would benefit from a recovery in the Sri Lankan economy, which is expected by economists to bounce back to around six percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year after a slowdown to 3.8 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>But he said the country's 14-year-old ethnic war, in which the government has been battling separatists of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), still hampered the economy.</p>
<p>The LTTE is fighting for a homeland for the minority Tamil population in the island's north and east.</p>
<p>&quot;If some settlement of this war takes place, we have no doubt that the country will boom and all of us will thrive,&quot; Perlis said. &quot;Sri Lanka is well placed if that happens to play a major role in South Asia. DFCC will be part of that boom.&quot;</p>
<p>Prelis said the group, a specialist bank under legislation passed this week, would expand in several areas such as treasury operations, stockbroking and investment banking, possibly in alliance with other local or foreign banks.</p>
<p>He said Sri Lanka was likely to see mergers and acquisitions in the banking and finance sector over the next few years, creating fewer but bigger bank groups.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka now has more than 25 banks and a range of smaller finance houses dealing with specialist lending for a largely rural population of just over 18 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The proliferation of small financial institutions is not a healthy development because they are too small. They will have to amalgamate or merge to be good for this sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prelis said he could envisage a scenario in the future where DFCC Bank would tie up with the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corp and with Sri Lanka's Commercial Bank.</p>
<p>He said DFCC was continuing to discuss with British bank Standard Chartered Plc the possibility of buying part of its stake in the local Commercial Bank.</p>
<p>Such a tie-up could produce useful synergies and help both banks offer better service to their clients, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got the permission of the Central Bank for taking a major portion of Commercial Bank. We may form a strategic alliance with Commercial Bank in future,&quot; he said.</p>
