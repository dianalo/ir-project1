<p>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) has rejected offers in its April reformate buying tender and is seeking to negotiate with those who made the best offers, a company official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>CPC tendered for one unleaded and one leaded cargo of 250,000-barrels each of 95-octane reformate on a cost-and-freight (c-and-f) basis to Keelung, Taichung, Kaohsiung or Shalung.</p>
<p>The tender closed March and offers for the April 1-15 deliveries were valid for two days.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will put off the decision until tomorrow,&quot; the official said. &quot;The price is too high and we have asked fore-runners to reconsider their offers.&quot;</p>
<p>Some industry sources said the best offer for the leaded cargo was at $29.70 per barrel c-and-f and the best unleaded cargo offer was $29.50.</p>
<p>The official said the offers were not so high, but only said most offers were more than $29.00.</p>
<p>The official also said CPC's marketing department would also be consulted whether the purchases were essential.  </p>
<p>In its last tender, CPC bought two unleaded cargoes for March 16-30 delivery at $27.90 and $28.20 per barrel on a cost-and-freight basis respectively from a Dutch trader and a South Korean trader, traders said.</p>
