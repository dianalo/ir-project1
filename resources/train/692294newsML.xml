<p>Macau's governor said on Friday he had &quot;positive expectations&quot; for the future of neighbouring Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>&quot;The transfer of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China is an event of great regional and international relevance, and I have positive expectations about the future of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that will be born on July 1,&quot; General Vasco Rocha Vieira said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's 156 years under British rule will end at midnight (1600 GMT) on Monday when Britain's heir to the throne Prince Charles hands over the bustling territory of 6.4 million people to Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>Tiny Macau, a Portuguese-run enclave of 455,000 people about 40 km (25 miles) west of Hong Kong, reverts to Chinese administration on December 20, 1999.</p>
<p>Vieira said the success of Hong Kong's handover to China &quot;constitutes, obviously, a very positive point of reference regarding the process in Macau and an important factor in consolidating the atmosphere of increased confidence among the population (of the enclave)&quot;.</p>
<p>The governor said he was certain the &quot;good relations of cooperation&quot; between Hong Kong and Macau would remain, but stressed that there were differences between the two.</p>
<p>&quot;Both are territories of different characteristics that are many times complementary,&quot; he said. &quot;The models applied to Hong Kong are not necessarily valid for Macau.&quot;</p>
