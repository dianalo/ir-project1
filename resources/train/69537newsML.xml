<p>Greek opposition leader Miltiades Evert conceded defeat in national elections on Sunday and said he was resigning as leader of the conservative New Democracy party.  </p>
<p>&quot;I take personal responsibility for the election result. I resign as president of the (conservative) party,&quot; he said in a brief televised statement.</p>
<p>Evert, 57, fought a vigorous campaign after socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis called early elections and he confounded opinion poll analysts by coming from behind to run a neck-and-neck race.</p>
<p>But early election returns showed the conservatives trailing by three percentage points and acting Interior Minister Vassilis Kouris said the socialist lead was irreversible. Most embarrassing for Evert was that it appeared a solid block of conservatives had voted for Simitis.</p>
