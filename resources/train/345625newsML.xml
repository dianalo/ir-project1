<title>USA: CME hogs and pork bellies seen steady to lower.</title>

<text>
<p>CME hog and pork belly futures alike, were expected to open steady to 0.200 cent a lb lower, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Further pressure in live hog futures was expected to stem from lower cash hog prices early Thursday and an easier cash pork prices. Hog runs were seen expanding as temperatures warm in the Corn Belt and hogs backed up by the last cold snap come to market, analysts said.</p>
<p>However, some analysts noted that hog runs and slaughter have not been as large as anticipated and this could bring on short covering if prices hold Wednesday's lows, they said.  </p>
<p>The expected larger hog runs and projected increased kills have also weighed on pork belly values and a steady to weak tone to cash product should spark pressure in pork belly futures early. But the market could quickly run into support after a recent sharp selloff, they said.</p>
<p>The market is looking oversold and slaughter rates have been somewhat lighter than expected. Short covering developed late Wednesday to pare losses in most months and the covering could continue if hog runs and kills look like they will remain under earlier expectations, they added.</p>
