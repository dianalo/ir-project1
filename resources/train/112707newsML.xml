<p>Finland joined the European Union's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) currency grid on Saturday in a move hailed as a boost for the prospects of a single European currency.</p>
<p>The EU's monetary committee brought the markka into the grid at a central rate of 3.04 to the German mark, a decision which takes effect on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministers, the governors, the (European) Commission, and the European Monetary Institute warmly welcome the participation of the markka in the exchange rate mechanism, which strengthens the European Monetary System,&quot; the committee said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;They congratulated the Finnish authorities on the substantial adjustments already achieved by the Finnish economy which is reflected in this decision.&quot;</p>
<p>A separate statement from European Commission President Jacques Santer and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said it would boost the chances of the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The enlargement of the mechanism to include a new currency is a very positive signal on the way to the realisation of the euro,&quot; their statement said.</p>
<p>The markka was trading at 2.986 to the German mark at the close of business on Friday.</p>
<p>The statement said the markka would be allowed to fluctuate by up to 15 percent against the other currencies in the grid, the normal margins since the ERM bands were widened in August 1993 after severe pressure on the system.</p>
<p>A Finnish central banker at the meeting told reporters Finland intended the markka to trade within &quot;relatively narrow&quot; bands.</p>
<p>&quot;It will certainly be our policy to keep it within a relatively narrow range,&quot; Bank of Finland director Matti Vanhala told Reuters after the meeting.</p>
<p>The committee, made up of senior finance ministry and central bank officials from the 15 EU member states, met for more than four hours before announcing its decision.</p>
<p>Its statement made no mention of other changes to the ERM, which means that Britain, Sweden, Greece and Italy remain outside the grid.</p>
<p>One official said there had been no discussion of the Italian lira. Italy has said it wants to return to the grid this year.</p>
<p>In Stockholm, the Swedish central bank said Finland's membership would not affect Sweden's position that it does not have to join the ERM to qualify for the new single currency.</p>
<p>In Paris, French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis hailed the markka link as another sign that the international community was committed to monetary stability.</p>
<p>Stability among the bloc's currencies is a criterion for the single currency, due to be launched in 1999. Some countries argue that the Maastricht Treaty requires countries to be in the ERM for two years to qualify for membership of the single currency.</p>
<p>The ERM allows currencies to fluctuate against each other in set bands around a central rate.</p>
<p>The markka has been floating freely since September 8, 1992. It was briefly linked unilaterally to the European Currency Unit (Ecu) between June and November 1991, when it was devalued by around 12 percent and then re-linked to the Ecu.</p>
<p>But strong foreign exchange market speculation forced it further down in value, and it has since been left to float freely.</p>
