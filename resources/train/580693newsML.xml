<headline>INTERVIEW - BOC targets Asia Pacific sales.</headline>

<p>British-based international gases supplier BOC Group Plc said on Tuesday it expected the proportion of sales achieved in the booming Asia Pacific region to rise sharply in the next few years.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with Reuters following publication of first-half results, chief executive Danny Rosenkranz said &quot;we'd expect Asia Pacific to move in three to four years to the mid-30s&quot; in percentage terms.</p>
<p>In the six months to the end of March the region accounted for just over 29 percent of the group's turnover of 1.928 billion stg, Europe for almost 32 percent and the U.S. for nearly 31 percent.</p>
<p>Rosenkranz said the group would continue to concentrate on the North Pacific region, notably Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.  </p>
<p>Investment in expensive gas-production plants, which need to be close to customers because of the tricky nature of transportation, mean the company has heavy up-front investment costs which it aims to earn back over a 15-year period.</p>
<p>Rosenkranz said a number of investments, notably in the U.S, were expected to come on stream in the second half which would feed through into improved sales and profits.</p>
<p>Capital spending totalled 359 million stg in the six months to March 31, compared with 324 million a year before. BOC said it expected to spend between 750 million and 800 million stg in the current year, up from 700 million stg previously.  </p>
<p>Rosenkranz said the results showed a &quot;a pretty satisfactory quarter and six months, very much in line with expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there would not be &quot;too much of a change&quot; in the impact of sterling on full-year results if it continued at current levels. BOC said it did not hedge translation costs, but all transaction costs were hedged. It had also ensured that debt was in local currencies where appropriate.</p>
<p>The company said profit margins were &quot;a little bit up on this time last year&quot;, while interest cover held steady at 5.6 times compared with 5.7 at the end of September and cash flow climbed sharply to 298 million stg from 210 million. The company said the improvement in cash flow reflected &quot;better management of working capital.&quot; Finance director Tony Isaac said the improvement in the second half would not be as pronounced, and predicted that full-year cash flow would be between 700 and 750 million stg.  </p>
<p>In gases, where sales and operating profits were flat at 1.388 billion stg and 199.2 million stg respectively, Rosenkranz said the U.S. and North Pacific regions all showed &quot;good growth,&quot; while in South Africa growth exceeded that of the economy a whole.</p>
<p>He said the UK and Australia had &quot;flattish performances,&quot; and said BOC's British manufacturing customers were themselves being hit by the strength of sterling.</p>
<p>At healthcare, where the group specialises in inhalable anaesthetics and critical monitoring equipment, sales dropped nine percent to 226.3 million stg and profits were down eight percent at 26.1 million stg, BOC said the market had continued to be &quot;tough,&quot; particularly in the U.S.  </p>
<p>The division suffered a setback earlier this year when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended a patent on Zeneca Group Plc's anaesthetic Diprivan until 1999, torpedoing BOC's plans to launch a generic competitor.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the division is ripe for sell-off, but Rosenkranz repeated his mantra that &quot;we will keep it on the basis that it is worth more to us than to somebody else.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosenkranz said the troubled specialist vacuum business had &quot;a good half year,&quot; despite a 17 percent drop in sales to 168.8 million stg and profits down 20 percent at 24.9 million stg, with orders rising in the first half.</p>
<p>The division relies heavily on the U.S. semiconductor industry, which Rosenkranz said was &quot;very hard to read. In the next year to two years I think it will be choppy, but ... by late 1998/1999 I think it will be up and running, which leaves us quite encouraged.&quot;</p>
