<headline>CVRD auction reset for May 5 - ministry.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Brazilian government has rescheduled the privatization auction of state miner Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) for May 5, a spokeswoman for the Planning Ministry said.  </p>
<p>The Planning Ministry has ordered the National Development Bank (BNDES) to publish on Saturday a special notice in the Official Gazette and Brazil's local main newspapers with the new date, she said.</p>
<p>If the auction cannot take place on Monday, the government will reschedule the auction again for the following day and will keep resetting it every day during a certain period of time that may be 10 days, she added.  </p>
<p>The government's decision to reschedule the auction for Monday came after a judge at the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) said he would not rule before Monday on a government request that all injunctions impeding the CVRD sale be heard by a single court.</p>
<p>&quot;I will examine the process on Saturday and Sunday and on Monday I may have a decision,&quot; Justice Democrito Reinaldo told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>A STJ decision in the government's favor would allow the government to move to overturn injunctions that had been granted by several different courts.</p>
<p>The CVRD auction was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but the selloff, the biggest in Latin America to date, has been delayed by a slew of legal challenges.</p>
