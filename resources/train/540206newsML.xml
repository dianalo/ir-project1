<headline>Turkey's Ciller chairs party meeting amid turmoil.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-04-25</dateline>

<p>Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller went into an unscheduled meeting of her True Path Party (DYP) on Friday after a newspaper report that she planned to withdraw from the Islamist-led coalition.</p>
<p>Ciller declined to answer journalists' questions on entering the meeting at party headquarters.</p>
<p>A minister in Ciller's faction said earlier he did not expect her to quit the alliance over a growing dispute between the government and the army.</p>
<p>The Yeni Yuzyil daily quoted unnamed cabinet ministers as saying Ciller, also the foreign minister, had decided to pull the DYP out of the 10-month-old government over</p>
<p>State Minister Salim Ensarioglu, a member of True Path, said he was unaware of any attempt by Ciller to ditch government partner Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist leader.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no information on such a decision. I don't expect a withdrawal,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Turkish stocks were little changed in early trade on Friday. Shares dropped 4.9 percent on Thursday on fears the alliance was crumbling.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling among the DYP is that Ciller has definitely decided to pull out,&quot; wrote Yeni Yuzyil columnist Bilal Cetin, a leading political analyst.</p>
<p>Ciller's faction is uneasy at the Erbakan's failure to implement an anti-Islamist crackdown demanded by the powerful army.</p>
<p>Erbakan will face the generals at a meeting of the National Security Council on Saturday that has been billed as a showdown.</p>
