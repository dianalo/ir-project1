<p>Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will resume talks on Tuesday on a long-delayed partial Israeli troop pullout from the West Bank city of Hebron, a top PLO negotiator said.</p>
<p>Chief Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) negotiator Mahmoud Abbas told Reuters he was to hold talks with Israeli Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant-General Amnon Shahak in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel confirmed the planned meeting and said there had been ongoing contacts between the sides at different levels.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier on Tuesday at a Cairo economic conference to discuss the stalemate on implementing Israeli-PLO interim peace deals.</p>
<p>&quot;(My meeting) with Mr Christopher was very positive too because we were speaking frankly about all the obstacles which we are facing in the negotiations,&quot; Arafat told reporters upon returning to self-ruled Gaza.</p>
<p>Christopher told the Cairo Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference that Arabs and Israelis remained committed to the peace process and he believed agreement on a partial Israeli withdrawal from Hebron was &quot;close at hand.&quot;</p>
<p>PLO officials said weekend talks between Danny Naveh, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and PLO Executive Committee member Yasser Abed Rabbo had achieved no results.</p>
<p>Abbas said Palestinians were awaiting Israel's response to proposals on security arrangements in Hebron to bridge the gaps between the sides.</p>
<p>&quot;They are still refusing to put in writing that they are committed to implement the accords,&quot; Abbas said.</p>
<p>More than one month of intensive U.S.-brokered talks between PLO and Israeli negotiators have failed to achieve results.</p>
<p>Netanyahu wants the Hebron deal signed by Israel's previous government changed to safeguard some 400 Jewish settlers in Hebron, home to 100,000 Palestinians. Palestinians reject any changes to the signed accords.</p>
<p>The Hebron pullout should have been implemented last March but was delayed after a wave of Islamist suicide attacks killed scores in Israel.</p>
