<text>
<p>Greek equities ended 0.20 percent lower on Tuesday with market analysts saying it was the result of profit taking but remaining bullish for 1997, expecting the benchmark index to reach the 1,700-1,800 level, by year-end.</p>
<p>&quot;Tuesday's session was one of profit-taking. The day's high was 1,441.32 points. This level was close to the bourse's last high at 1,453.60 points, where the market closed on February 26,&quot; said analyst Nikos Kostopoulos, at Commercial Securities.</p>
<p>If the general share index consolidates above the 1,400 level for the next few sessions, it could easily pierce the 1,450-1,500 level in the short term, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;On Friday and Monday the rise was milder than the ones we witnessed towards the end of February. This time the bourse's climb is more solid and steady. If trading volume increases, it will be another good sign,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kostopoulos remained bullish in his 1997 outlook, saying the index could rise to 1,700-1,800 points by year-end.</p>
<p>Another analyst said that the Greek bourse continues to be highly attractive among other emerging markets.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of price to book value (P/BV) or price to earnings (P/E) ratios, Greek shares are still attractive,&quot; said analyst George Athanasakis, at Alpha Brokerage.</p>
<p>He added that the only concern for investors could be press reports of lower-than-expected tax revenue growth in March.</p>
<p>&quot;Government expenditures also seem to have risen more than expected. However, the drop in T-bills rates may more than compensate for that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed 0.20 percent or 2.86 points lower at 1,436.55 from Monday's 1,439.41 close, after opening at 1,441.32. The session's high was 1,444.58 and its low 1,420.21 points.</p>
<p>Turnover was 19.4 billion drachmas on trading volume of 4.4 million shares. Decliners led advancers 145 to 73, with 26 issues remaining unchanged on 244 traded.</p>
<p>Most sectoral indices were down, with greatest losses incurred in the small-cap parallel market, which dropped 1.52 percent.</p>
<p>Construction lost 0.57 percent, banks dropped 0.80 percent and industrials fell 0.59 percent. Only leasing shares ended 0.11 percent firmer.</p>
<p>The recently launched ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted lower at $58.96-$60.66. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997.</p>
<p>The recently issued ING Baring Financial Products American- style call warrant on a basket of six blue-chips denominated in drachmas was quoted higher at 2,381-2,580 drachmas.</p>
<p>The strike price is set at 10,000 drachmas and the warrants expire on February 2, 1998. --Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
