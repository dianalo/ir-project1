<p>President Bill Clinton and his foreign policy advisers held talks on Thursday on his second-term strategic goal of expanding NATO and placating an angry Russia.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the hour-long meeting was the first in a series of foreign policy meetings Clinton will hold in coming weeks on U.S. global strategy.</p>
<p>The group, including Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright and top National Security Council officials, heard a report from Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who returned on Wednesday night from a tour of European capitals to discuss NATO.</p>
<p>Talbott made quick visits this week to London, Brussels, Paris and Bonn, where he reviewed NATO's agenda in detail.</p>
<p>Leaders of 16 NATO countries are to meet in Madrid on July 8-9 to formally invite some of the formerly communist countries in Eastern Europe, most of which were once members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, to join the western alliance.</p>
<p>Hungary, Poland and the Czech republic are considered the front-runners, but Romania and Slovenia are also being discussed for early admittance.</p>
<p>Alliance officials also want to negotiate a special charter with Moscow that would ensure Russia did not feel excluded from the new Europeran security structures but was engaged in a close and cooperative relationship with NATO.</p>
<p>Russia is vehemently opposed to enlarging NATO to include former Soviet bloc countries, insisting this would threaten its security and create new divisions in Europe.</p>
<p>The Washington Post said the United States and its European allies had decided to offer a fresh package of incentives to soften Russian antagonism toward NATO expansion.</p>
<p>It said the inducements would include new flexibility on arms control problems, greater economic assistance and a special consultative status.</p>
<p>Russia wants a role in NATO decision-making.</p>
<p>While not confirming the report, National Security Adviser-designate Samuel Berger said the United States and its allies were discussing ways to let Russia consult on NATO operations in the same way NATO and Russia worked together toward achieving peace in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;We're talking about some type of consultative mechanism that would not give them veto power over NATO decisions but, particularly with respect to NATO operations in which they might be engaged, an opportunity to be part of that consultative process,&quot; Berger told network radio reporters.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Javier Solana is to open charter negotiations on Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. The behind-the-scenes activity is taking place as Russian President Boris Yeltsin makes a slow recovery from heart bypass surgery.</p>
<p>Clinton and his top aides have identified six strategic global priorities for his second term, which begins formally on Monday when he takes his oath of office.</p>
<p>At the top of the list is how to make Europe an undivided continent at peace from London to the Urals.</p>
<p>McCurry said the advisers at their meeting were not reaching conclusions but were engaged in long-range thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of questions related to the future of NATO, the future of some of the efforts to relieve ethnic tensions, matters as complicated as the Northern Ireland peace process to Cyprus,&quot; he said.</p>
