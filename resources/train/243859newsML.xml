<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch bonds regained most of the losses suffered last Friday but the gains were struck on little turnover with most activity confined to Bund futures.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was mainly square after the plunge in prices sparked by the warning by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan about &quot;irrational exuberence&quot; in world markets.</p>
<p>The closing yield on the key Jan 2006 bond of 5.73 percent was just three basis points below that on April 2006 Bunds, the lowest gap since August.</p>
<p>&quot;We underperformed a bit on the way up in guilders. Bunds are going up a bit faster, as usual,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>He expected the narrow spread, which compares to a peak of 16 basis points in September, to spark some buying.</p>
<p>&quot;We traded up further without much resistance. The market has upside potential,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>He noted buying interest from domestic institutions in 2005 and 2006 paper, explaining that longer dated bonds gave them the returns needed to meet their long-term obligations.</p>
<p>A broker said last week's events left market players square but she saw interest in selected maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;Otherwise, there's no real trend,&quot; she said, adding this should change with U.S. price and retail sales data this week.</p>
