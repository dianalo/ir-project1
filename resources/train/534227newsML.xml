<p>Great Western Financial Corp said a Delaware Chancery Court judge will announce its decision on Friday regarding H.F. Ahmanson and Co's request for Great Western to change its annual meeting date.</p>
<p>&quot;The judge has taken it under advisement and will announce his decision by the close of business Friday,&quot; said a Great Western spokesman.</p>
<p>Great Western on Monday said a majority of shareholders appeared to support a proposal by hostile suitor Ahmanson to force Great Western to hold its annual meeting by May 6. Great Western has scheduled its meeting for June 13.  </p>
<p>Great Western also said it will also soon file an action in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to enjoin an attempt by Ahmanson to double vote more than five million shares in its solicitations of consents from Great Western stockholders.</p>
<p>H.F. Ahmanson issued a release Thursday saying that it was notified by the independent inspector CT Corp Systems, that Great Western refused to agree to a count by CT on a consent solicitation proposal that urges the Great Western board to negotiate with Ahmanson.</p>
