<p>Venezuela's monthly inflation rate will bounce up to between 2.1 and 3.0 percent in April, from 1.6 percent in March, due to recent public sector wage hikes and higher inflationary expectations, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems clear that inflation's descent will be interrupted. The very favorable results in January, February and March could bounce back in April when inflation will be between 2.5 and 3.0 percent,&quot; said university economics professor Salvador Chang.  </p>
<p>The Central Bank was due to announce the official April inflation rate later Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts highlighted a recent 70 percent salary increase awarded to public sector workers as the main driving force behind the expected acceleration in price rises. The salary rise went into effect in February 12.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate inflation of 2.3 percent in April based on expectations of price increases caused mainly by salary increases,&quot; said Daniel Lahoud of Invest Analysis consultants.  </p>
<p>The monthly inflation rate fell to its lowest level in five years in March and some analysts felt forecasts of a major rebound in price rises were exaggerated.</p>
<p>Jose Barcia of local consultants MetroEconomica estimated April inflation at between 2.1 and 2.3 percent because, &quot;the impact on prices was not that large, despite a rise in telephone rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Official estimates of April's inflation rate published in local daily El Nacional Wednesday put it at 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>The government has set a target of slashing inflation from 103 percent in 1996 to about 30 percent this year.</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus has warned that this goal was in danger of being jeopardized by wage hike pressures and fiscal indiscipline.</p>
<p>Barcia said the government was paying the price for having delayed much-needed wage rises for public sector employees.</p>
<p>And Chang noted that a policy of allowing interest rates to remain negative in real terms was continuing to stimulate consumption.</p>
