<p>Brazilian striker Anderson scored twice in the last eight minutes to give UEFA Cup semifinalists Monaco a 3-1 home win over Bastia and lift them 10 points clear at the top of the French first division on Saturday.</p>
<p>Second-placed Paris St Germain, who reached the European Cup Winners' Cup semifinals on Thursday, can cut the lead back by three points if they beat Metz at home on Sunday.</p>
<p>Anderson, who had not scored in Monaco's previous three league games, took his tally for the season to 17, coverting an 82nd-minute penalty then chipping keeper Fabien Piveteau in the 88th after being put through by midfielder Ali Benarbia.</p>
<p>Monaco made heavy weather of their victory, two glaring misses by Nigeria's Victor Ikpeba denying them a comfortable lead after they had gone in front in the 13th minute with a left-footed drive from the left by Scotland's John Collins.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm satisfied that we've won this important match,&quot; coach Jean Tigana said. &quot;The Corsicans' fighting spirit gave us trouble but we held out physically.</p>
<p>&quot;We never gave up. This is not a turning point in the championship but we continue our march forward. We have four days to recover. We must win at Nice on Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>Pole Piotr Swierczewski's 38th-minute equaliser for Bastia was the first goal conceded at home by France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez in 867 minutes of football dating back to early November.</p>
<p>Bastia's challenge for second spot and a place in the European Cup next season has faltered. The club have taken only one point from their last three matches.</p>
<p>Nantes have replaced Bastia as the biggest threat to PSG. They climbed to third, one point behind PSG, with a 1-0 home win over Lille, stretching their unbeaten run to 23 matches.</p>
<p>Striker Japhet N'Doram scored the only goal from the penalty spot in the 78th minute after a foul on Tunisia's Adel Sellimi. It was N'Doram's 17th goal of the season and Nantes' 2,000th in the first division.</p>
<p>Strasbourg lost for the first time in five games, 2-1 at Guingamp, to drop two places to fifth. Both Guingamp's goals were scored by midfielder Charles-Edouard Coridon.</p>
<p>Lens seemed libertated by having to stage their home match against Auxerre at Le Havre because of a one-match suspension on their Bollaert ground after a fan knocked out a linesman with a water bottle last month.</p>
<p>The defending champions, eliminated from the European Cup quarter-finals in midweek, went down 2-1 to goals by veteran Philippe Vercruysse and Czech Republic striker Vladimir Smicer. Lilian Laslandes pulled one back with a diving header.</p>
<p>Lens had won only once at the Bollaert, a 1998 World Cup venue, in seven previous home matches.</p>
<p>Laslandes said Auxerre were unlucky with their finishing, especially a shot which hit the post. &quot;Now we must buckle under and prepare for Paris (St Germain) on Wednesday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Auxerre captain Franck Silvestre said: &quot;We must grit our teeth and try to grab as many points as possible to qualify for Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>Nice, six points adrift at the bottom of the table, fell to their 19th defeat of the season 2-1 at Montpellier, who are unbeaten in nine games.</p>
<p>But the Cote d'Azur side scored the cheekiest goal of the night. Liberia's James Debbah was forced to his right as he burst into the box with the ball but turned to back-heel it past former France goalkeeper Bruno Martini from 10 metres.</p>
<p>Nice had defender Matthieu Louis-Jean sent off for a second bookable offence 15 minutes from time.</p>
