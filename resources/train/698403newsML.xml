<title>MOZAMBIQUE: Mozambique ready to help in peacekeeping.</title>

<p>Mozambique's government presented a bill in parliament on Tuesday that would allow the country's army to participate in international peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>It says the army should &quot;take part in activities aimed at maintaining peace and respect for international law and in the defence and security of the region and the continent, by supporting action to prevent and resolve conflicts&quot;.</p>
<p>The bill sets out general guidelines on defence and security policy and deals mainly with purely national principles -- such as keeping the army separate from party politics.</p>
<p>It also stresses &quot;the primacy of the prevention and negotiated solution of conflicts&quot;, and Mozambique's contribution to building and maintaining a stable and peaceful international order.</p>
<p>Mozambique has never been invloved in international peacekeeping operations but is no stranger to regional conflict.</p>
<p>In the 1970s it provided military bases for Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwean independence fighters and in the 1980s it was home to South African anti-apartheid military commanders.</p>
<p>It also sent an artillery unit to Uganda to help President Yoweri Museveni, whose soldiers were trained in northern Mozambique, come to power.</p>
