<p>A military court in Jordan sentenced a soldier to life imprisonment with hard labour on Saturday for killing seven Israeli schoolgirls in March.</p>
<p>The five-man panel of military judges said the soldier, Ahmed Daqamsa, was guilty of murder but said his crime was not premeditated.</p>
<p>&quot;The council finds that the circumstances of premeditation do not exist because it is clear that the accused suffers from a personality disorder, with a quick temper which he could not control,&quot; tribunal head Brigadier Mamoun Khasawneh announced.</p>
<p>Military prosecutors had told the court during the two-month trial that Daqamsa plotted to kill Israelis for years and carefully planned his attack.</p>
<p>But defence lawyers said Daqamsa was a pious man with a mental disorder, who was provoked by the girls while he was praying.</p>
