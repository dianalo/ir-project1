<title>THAILAND: Thailand to announce daily baht-dlr reference rate.</title>
<headline>Thailand to announce daily baht-dlr reference rate.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-07-02</dateline>

<p>Thailand's central bank said on Wednesday that a baht-dollar reference rate would be set daily following the surprise decision to float the baht.</p>
<p>The reference rate would be based on the baht's trading average the day before, deputy central bank governor Chaiyawat Wibulsawasdi told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand had an &quot;appropriate rate&quot; in mind to which it expected the baht to move. &quot;However, if it goes beyond the appropriate rate the central bank will intervene in the market,&quot; said central bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond.</p>
<p>Central bank officials said that under the new baht system they would be following the Singapore model of managing the currency. They did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Chaiyawat said the central bank expected the baht to remain volatile in the short term, but said the public need not panic.</p>
<p>He added that the authorities would also give businesses affected by the baht's flotation and subsequent volatility soft loans to help them meet foreign debt repayments.</p>
<p>Another senior central bank official said that the baht would in future not be governed by a basket of currencies, dominated by the dollar.</p>
<p>A two-tier baht market - one offshore and another onshore - that has been in place since the last speculative attack on the baht in May when the central bank imposed currency controls would remain in place for now but its future would be reviewed, bank officials said.</p>
<p>The central bank has recently punished baht speculators by cutting off baht supplies to foreign speculators from local sources.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the two tier system) will remain in place but we are considering its future,&quot; said a senior central bank official.</p>
<p>Rerngchai said the authorities had purposely chosen a managed float of the baht rather than a widening of the four-satang band that used to govern commercial bank dealings on the baht for dollars with the Bank of Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;If there had been a band widening it would not have worked because...you are exposed in the light and the speculators are hidden in the dark,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rerngchai said foreigners and non-resident bank clients are banned from buying dollars for speculative purposes. He said foreigners failing to produce evidence of underlying business or investment transactions would not be allowed to buy dollars or raise dollar funds by selling short-term, baht-denominated money market instruments with a maturity of less than six-months.</p>
<p>The governor said the restrictive measures are temporary but he declined to give a time-frame.</p>
