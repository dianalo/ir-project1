<p>The Australian government's A$1.0 billion annual public housing funding package may be cut by up to A$200 million in the 1997/98 budget, according to a newspaper report published on Monday.</p>
<p>The Australian newspaper said Treasury and the Department of Finance had told the government that public housing funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement should be cut by A$150 million to $200 million in the May 13 budget.</p>
<p>It said the move would significantly reduce the construction of new accommodation for public tenants and could force state governments to commercialise their housing authorities to boost their efficiency.</p>
<p>Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the Australian government provides a total annual subsidy of A$1.0 billion to the state governments to help low income tenants and for public housing construction.</p>
<p>But under the leaked proposal, the government would convert its current funding into increased income support for social welfare recipients living in rental accommodation while giving state governments total responsibility for the provision of public housing.</p>
<p>The newspaper said under the current agreement, state governments were required to spend A$427 million on public housing in the year to June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>They would not be able to cover any sharp reduction in Commonwealth funding out of their own budgets, leading to a strong backlash from the states if the budget cut was approved, it said.</p>
<p>But the newspaper quoted government sources as saying the cut was necessary if the government was to achieve the A$2.0 billion in annual cut in its budget needed to achieve balance in 1998/99.</p>
