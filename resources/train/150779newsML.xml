<p>German shares ended weaker on Tuesday after the dollar weakened against the mark following comments by German economic institutes that interest rates may have to rise.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index, which measures all-day computer trade in 30 leading shares, ended at 2,675.50 points, down 27.83 points, or 1.03 percent, was helped off the day's lows by a slightly firmer opening on Wall Street.</p>
<p>In floor trade the DAX index reversed gains made on Monday when it had reached above the crucial 2,700 point mark, to end down 30.21 points, or 1.12 percent, at 2,673.62.</p>
<p>The dollar dropped below the 1.51-mark level after the country's six leading economic research institutes said German interest rates may need to rise if money supply growth remained above target levels.</p>
<p>Several dealers said they were not sure where the German share market would head next and suggested a correction down as far as the 2,620 point level could still be necessary if the DAX index was to make any real advances.</p>
<p>But they said direction would be likely to come from the U.S. for the rest of the week as a stream of data is released.</p>
<p>Dealers complained of thin trading and said a public holiday in parts of Germany on Friday could also limit volumes for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Chemical company BASF AG was the most heavily traded stock of the day, ending IBIS dealings at 48.85 marks, down 15 pfennigs, but firmer than the market trend and the rest of the chemical sector, with dealers saying a large buy order had supported the stock.</p>
