<p>Thai stocks, which gained 7.87 percent on Wednesday after the baht was floated, were expected to continue rising on Thursday on foreign buying of discounted blue-chip stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are expected to buy blue-chip banking, communication and energy stocks today as they were not able to buy yesterday because prices of those issues hit limit up,&quot; said Thaneit Khantigaroon of Ekachart Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>The composite SET index rose 41.51 points to 568.79 on active 10.4 billion baht turnover on Wednesday. The SET-50 index advanced 3.54 points to 41.74.  </p>
<p>All large capitalised stocks hit limit up by midday on Wednesday as foreigners bought on the belief that stock prices were cheaper by about 10 percent compared to Monday's prices after the central bank announced the flotation of the baht.</p>
<p>Total net buying by foreigners on Wednesday amounted to 1.7 billion baht.</p>
<p>Thailand's unexpected baht flotation on Wednesday was warmly greeted by the battered bourse because punters believed it would finally end rumours of a baht devaluation that had been swirling in the market over the past few months.</p>
