<headline>FOCUS-European bourses revived by Wall St gains.</headline>

<p>European stocks made healthy gains in early trade on Tuesday, revived by a positive close on Wall Street and relieved that Germany's central bank decided to leave a key interest rate unchanged.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the dollar jumped half a pfennig after the Bundesbank on Tuesday kept its repo rate steady at 3.00 percent but shed some of the gains as traders took the view that the threat of rising German rates remained in the market. Sterling retreated in sympathy.</p>
<p>The stronger showing on European bourses followed Monday's  lacklustre start to the week when investors were shaken by a two percent drop in New York on Friday, leading to fears that the recent bull run was was petering out.</p>
<p>Among Tuesday's best performers was the Paris bourse, which ended well down on Monday. It climbed 0.89 percent at the opening on bullish sentiment after the Bundesbank move, traders said.</p>
<p>French tyre-maker Michelin , which reports first-half sales on Wednesday, helped lead the way. It rose  2.88 percent to 368.3 francs, pumped up by Continental's first-half profits increase.</p>
<p>Renewed strength overnight on Wall Street, after Friday's sharp decline, also boosted French investor confidence. But volume was expected to be light and the early gains began eroding by mid-morning.</p>
<p>London advanced 0.4 percent despite  stronger-than-forecast inflation figures. It was boosted by higher index futures and the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed up 30.89 points at 8062.11 on Monday.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index, which closed only just in the plus column last night, was at one stage trading only a few below its all-time peak of 5,086.8 set last Thursday.</p>
<p>The buoyant mood was also helped by big  gains for oil majors British Petroleum, up 16-1/2p to 906p, and Shell, up 7p. at 447-1/2p.</p>
<p>&quot;We're being helped by Wall Street and by the oils but the market's short and really was aching to go higher,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks climbed by 0.8 percent, encouraged by Wall Street and the dollar's recent strength, which boosts prospects for exporters.</p>
<p>All eyes in currency markets were on the Bundesbank as traders weighed up the effect of the &quot;no-change&quot; rate move.</p>
<p>The dollar and sterling made an indecisive response, first rising, then falling, then climbing again. By mid-morng, the dollar settled around 1.8580 marks, slightly up on Monday's closing level.</p>
<p>The British pound was at 2.9450 marks and $1.5830, only slightly down.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has changed. The threat that the Bundesbank will send a tightening signal to the market is still there,&quot; said Joe Prendergast, head of global foreign exchange research at CSFB.</p>
<p>Dealers said speculation about what the Bundesbank would do at next week's tender was kept alive because the central bank announced only one fortnightly tender this week.</p>
<p>Tim Fox, chief treasury economist at Standard Chartered, said the expected continuation of a fixed rate was bearish for the mark. Concern voiced recently by the Bank about the weakness of the mark had spurred the market into thinking that the central bank would allow the repo rate to edge higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Adjusting interest rates in order to influence the exchange rate is out of character for the Bundesbank,&quot; said Fox.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8580 marks and 115.92 yen, compared with 1.8543 and 115.78 in late trading on Monday</p>
