<p>Egyptian prosecutors issued a warrant on Saturday for the arrest of a Cairo doctor after an 11-year-old girl died under anaesthesia for a circumcision he was about to perform.</p>
<p>Amal Sayyed Bayyoumi went into a coma after receiving the anaesthetic in the doctor's clinic on Friday and died shortly afterwards, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>Her mother had taken her to the doctor, Abdelwahhab Mohamed Abdelwahhab, for the operation, which remains common for girls in Egypt despite the government's attempts to stamp it out.</p>
<p>Last year at least three Egyptian girls were reported to have died during circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation for the severe form it often takes.</p>
<p>The judicial sources said the doctor was wanted for questioning on possible manslaughter charges. The mother had agreed to pay the doctor 60 pounds ($18), they added.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.395 pounds</p>
