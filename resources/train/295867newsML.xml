<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks rebound to 4th straight record close.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks rebound to 4th straight record close.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-01-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks recovered from an early bout of profit-taking to chalk up their fourth record close in a row on Thursday after bargain-hunters stepped into the market in late trade, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Such selling as there was withered away. Once profit-taking had taken prices down, buyers came back from the sidelines,&quot; a technical analyst said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index  .MXX ended up 20.37 points, or 0.57 percent, at 3,578.34. Volume  .TV.MX was moderate at 84.1 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>Some dealers said demand for stocks was fueled by foreign investors taking positions ahead of the weekend and brokers picking up less marketable stocks at bargain prices.</p>
<p>&quot;After many blue chips had soared to resistance, investors turned to less marketable and bargain stocks, such as Camesa,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>Other dealers noted that sharp gains on Wall Street -- 1.16 percent to 6,625.67 points -- also bolstered the bolsa.</p>
<p>Analysts felt the bourse still had upside potential.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has woken up with a vengeance, and is still sending buy signals,&quot; the technical analyst said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Any corrections will only be to consolidate the upward trend towards 3,600 points,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Despite the record close, the broad market was mixed. Of a total of 102 stocks traded, sliders outnumbered gainers by 44 to 41.</p>
<p>Debt-stricken holding company Sidek headed the gainers, up ten centavos to 90 centavos, but after a minimal last-minute cross trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Financial group Serfin followed Sidek, up 33 centavos to 3.13 pesos, after what analysts said was a technical breakthrough at 2.90 pesos.  </p>
<p>Another gainer, steelmaker Ahmsa gained 88 centavos to 16.50 pesos following a long-term buy recommendation from Merrill Lynch, traders said.</p>
<p>Auto parts maker Iasasa fell four centavos to 29 centavos at the head of the sliders' list on persistent financial woes, traders said.</p>
<p>Bus and truck manufacturer, Dina, followed Iasasa, falling 25 centavos to 4.20 pesos after what traders said was a volatile session for its ADRs on Wall Street, which ended off 1/8 at 2-1/4.</p>
