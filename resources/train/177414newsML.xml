<headline>India's Rao gets bail in forgery, bribery cases.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1996-11-08</dateline>

<p>Former Indian prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao won reprieves against arrest in two cases of alleged forgery and bribery on Friday, two days after he was granted bail in a cheating case, court officials said.</p>
<p>The Delhi High Court, in separate hearings, granted bail to Rao in the two cases, effectively protecting him against arrest in any of the three criminal cases in which he has been charged.  </p>
<p>Rao, 75, was instructed not to tamper with evidence or hamper the trial in the two cases relating to Friday's order.</p>
<p>His bail in the bribery case, in which he is accused of bribing four lawmakers belonging to a regional party to narrowly win a confidence vote in parliament in 1993, will be reviewed on November 20.</p>
<p>The bail in the forgery case was granted until the end of the trial. He is accused of seeking to defame former prime minister V.P. Singh by forging documents to show Singh's son held a bank account in the Carribean island of St Kitts.</p>
<p>Rao was given bail in a cheating case by another Delhi judge on Wednesday. He has been charged with cheating expatriate Indian Lakhubhai Pathak of $100,000 in 1983.</p>
