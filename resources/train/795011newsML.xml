<p>Hong Kong stocks ended weak on Tuesday, reversing gains made earlier in the day, as a rising U.S. long bond yield and an increase in mortgage lending rates by two major banks prompted a slide in property shares.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index fell 77.06 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 16,383.41 after rising to an early high of 16,660.76.</p>
<p>Turnover was a heavy HK$27.93 billion compared with HK$22.99 billion on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is having a bit of trouble at these levels,&quot; said Richard Verin, head of equity trading at Credit Suisse First Boston.  </p>
<p>&quot;Standard Chartered and Hongkong Bank raised mortgage rates and when mortgage rates go up it is not positive for the property sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties tumbled HK$2.00 to HK$100.00, Cheung Kong fell HK$1.50 to HK$92.25 and New World Development dropped HK$1.00 at HK$56.50.</p>
<p>Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered Bank recently raised their mortgage rates by 25 basis points to 9.25 percent.</p>
<p>A rise of 30.89 points in the Dow industrials overnight to 8,062.11 had fuelled sharp gains in the local market in early trade, reversing a sharp slide in prices registered on Monday.  </p>
<p>But with a slew of U.S. economic data due out this week ahead of next Tuesday's U.S. Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting, brokers said investors were still cautious.</p>
<p>Economic figures due out this week include July producer and consumer prices and industrial production.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a rate rise, that is not good for property,&quot; said Rory McAllister at HSBC James Capal.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a chance that mortgage rates are going up which is keeping the index down,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Bank also pulled the Hang Seng Index down with a loss of HK$2.00 to HK$106.50.  </p>
<p>The stock surged HK$5.50 on Monday on speculation that a Chinese party might buy a stake in the bank.</p>
<p>But HSBC Holdings followed through on an overnight rally in London and added HK$3.00 to HK$273.00.</p>
<p>H-shares soared on Tuesday as investors continued to speculate on future restructuring in the sector.</p>
<p>The index of Hong Kong-listed Chinese enterprises rose 76.27 points, or 5.62 percent, to 1,433.95.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Index August futures fell 50 points to 16,290.</p>
