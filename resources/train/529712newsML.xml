<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - April 22 --------------</p>
<p>LIFFE cocoa futures should continue trading in a range with only a small leaning to the downside in the near term, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>July cocoa was called to open unchanged after closing on Monday down 13 stg at 1,021 stg per tonne.</p>
<p>New York July cocoa gapped lower on Monday and closed down $23 at $1,440, off its session low of $1,427, but volume was light at an estimated 4,610 lots.</p>
<p>Despite Monday's losses, Sucden analyst Adrian Haylor said cocoa did not yet look in danger of a freefall.</p>
<p>He said July might fall to test support at 1,000, but expected either that level or levels just below it to hold.  </p>
<p>Strong support was seen near 1,000 because a couple of support levels were clustered around there, Haylor said. A trendline from the February lows was coming in near 1,005, the 40-day moving average was perched on 996 and 980 was the recent low from April 9.</p>
<p>Haylor said only if those levels failed to hold would he consider cocoa to be in a definitive downtrend.</p>
<p>Some traders said a break of 987 would probably start attracting fund sales that could bring the market sharply lower.</p>
<p>Overall, Haylor still considered the earlier slide to 980 as a corrective drop and the subsequent climb back as the &quot;more bullish, impulsive move.&quot;</p>
<p>But he did not expect a steep climb until resistance at 1,065, the April 2 high, was broken.</p>
<p>A move toward 1,065 was expected to draw in fund buying, traders said.</p>
