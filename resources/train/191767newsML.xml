<title>UK: FORECAST - BOC result hit by pound, health.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - BOC result hit by pound, health.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-15</dateline>

<p>British gases specialist BOC Group Plc's full-year results on Tuesday are expected to be hit by the recent strength of sterling as well as problems already flagged in its vacuum and health businesses, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts predict pre-tax profit for the year to September of between 421 and 445 million stg compared with 402 million a year before.</p>
<p>The dividend, which BOC traditionally announces a year in advance, is seen climbing to between 27.0 and 29.0 pence from 25.9 pence.  </p>
<p>Analysts said there should be little room for surprise in the results, which will be roughly in line with the 11 percent rise in nine-months pre-tax profit to 327.3 million stg.</p>
<p>However, there is some concern that the recent strength of sterling may have eaten into profits. Earlier this week SBC Warburg cuts its forecasts for the year to 421 million stg from 438 million purely because of the impact of the stronger pound. Analysts had already cut full-year forecasts for the company after BOC effectively issued a profits warning with its third-quarter figures because of the problems in vacuums and anaesthetics.  </p>
<p>BOC said there had been a marked setback at its Edwards Vacuum Products division, which provides super-clean environments for the semi-conductor industry.</p>
<p>Edwards has suffered from the overcapacity and general downturn in semi-conductors. No recovery is expected for another 12 months at least.</p>
<p>In health, where BOC dominates the U.S. health gases market, the company continues to be hit by the fall in prices for its inhaled anesthetic gas Forane since it started to face generic competition.  </p>
<p>Forane's share is estimated to have fallen to around 17 percent of the U.S. market, although its follow-up product Suprane is taking up much of the slack.</p>
<p>One analyst with a European brokerage who asked not to be named said sales of Florane are likely &quot;to have fallen off a cliff&quot;.</p>
<p>Analysts are also keen for indications on when BOC will start to see the benefits flow through from heavy investment in the indistrial gases business, which accounts for around 70 percent of sales.  </p>
<p>In the year to Sept 30 the company is expected to have invested around 700 million stg, with much of the investment in the key U.S. market.</p>
