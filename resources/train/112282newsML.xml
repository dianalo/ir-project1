<p>France set itself on a collision course with its European neighbours when an official report recommended abolishing a twice-yearly change of clocks for summer and winter time.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, said France should unilaterally fix its clocks at its current winter time an hour ahead of GMT from 1998 despite a draft European Union directive urging EU members to keep the current system.</p>
<p>&quot;France should inform its partners as soon as possible, and without seeking to impose its choice on other EU members, that it wants to abandon summer time,&quot; said senator Philippe Francois who drafted the report, released on Thursday.</p>
<p>France and its neighbours -- including Germany, Italy and Spain -- have clocks one hour ahead of GMT in winter and put them forward by an hour for summer time, which ends on October 27. Time in Britain is an hour behind.</p>
<p>A European Commission spokeswoman in Brussels told Reuters the plan would &quot;throw up a bit of a problem&quot;. If adopted, it would break EU rules intended to harmonise the start and end dates for summertime in all 15 EU member countries.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are waiting for is the official position of the French government which we are told will come some time next Spring,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Francois said energy savings -- the reason for the current system introduced in 1976 after oil price hikes -- represented only 0.5 percent of French electricity use. And a switch to nuclear power to generate electricity made savings less urgent.</p>
<p>An opinion poll in January showed 72 percent of French people wanted to change the current system, even though fixing the clocks would mean the loss of long summer evenings and so push up energy use for lighting.</p>
<p>French time is out of joint with the sun, which is highest in the Paris sky around 2 p.m in summer, Francois said. Juppe said earlier this year he favoured ending the twice-yearly time change and ordered Francois to study how to implement the idea.</p>
<p>A member of Juppe's Rally for the Republic party, Francois dismissed suggestions that scrapping summer time would irk the EU. Paris has sought to keep in step with Germany on issues like a planned single currency from 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The new proposal is an acceptable compromise between European solidarity and respect for solar time,&quot; Francois told a news conference. &quot;France would have the same time as Germany in winter, the same as Britain in summer.&quot;</p>
<p>He said his report would now be passed to Juppe, who could decree an end to summer time without consulting parliament.</p>
<p>Juppe has been reproached by newspapers in Britain and Germany over the plan. &quot;French ministers meddle with the clocks at their peril,&quot; the London Times warned.</p>
<p>Francois played down fears that putting France out of step would complicate business within the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;Between New York and San Francisco there are four time zones. That doesn't seem to have damaged the economic development of the United States,&quot; he said. REUTER</p>
