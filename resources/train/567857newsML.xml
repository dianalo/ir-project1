<p>Singapore jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade edged down late afternoon on Wednesday on lower jet fuel physical trade late Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The regrade is coming in abit because of the increased offers and the bids are at lower levels,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>June regrade was last quoted at 50/60 cents down from Tuesday's 60/80 cents, brokers said.</p>
<p>Traders said the fall was partly due to the physical jet fuel trade on Tuesday at $25.00 per barrel, free on board Singapore, down from Monday's buying level of $25.30.</p>
<p>The emergence of fresh offers at the around the $25.00 mark has also affected sentiment, they said.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps extended its early day rise on firmer crude values and buying interest from new players, traders said.</p>
<p>May gas oil swaps were last quoted $25.40/$25.50 per barrel, up from Tuesday's $25.10/$25.20, brokers said.</p>
<p>May traded earlier in the day at $25.45, they said.</p>
<p>The buyer, a Chinese trader who has storage facilites in Malaysia, bought a 150,000-barrel cargo from a European major at $25.15 per barrel for loading June 1-5.</p>
<p>On top of this, two 150,000-barrel cargoes were sold to a local trader at $25.50 per barrel. The same trader together with two other traders have bought almost 19 million barrels of gas oil since March 3.</p>
<p>Traders said these actions suggest that there is strong support in the physical market at the $25.00 mark and the swaps market is taking its cue from these moves.</p>
<p>Traders said the firmer prices were also due to stronger crude with June Brent last trading up eight cents to $18.5 per barrel on top of a 10 cent overnight gain.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps regained its early morning losses to last quoted unchanged from Tuesday $100.00/$101.00 per tonne.</p>
