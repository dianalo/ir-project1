<p>Israel's army chief of staff and a parliamentary committee overseeing the military said on Tuesday the Jewish state's readiness for war had been sharply eroded by a lack of defence funding.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparedness for the possibility of war in the budgetary reality as I know it is intolerable,&quot; Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak told parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee.</p>
<p>Shahak spoke as a parliamentary military comptroller's subcommittee presented a report detailing serious deficiencies in military preparedness.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the lack of budgetary resources, the readiness of the army for war has been eroded in a very serious fashion. I stress: budgetary lack, not complacency,&quot; subcommittee chairman Efraim Sneh told reporters.</p>
<p>Sneh, a member of the opposition Labour party and an army reserve brigadier-general, said the report detailed inadequate emergency supplies, aging and outdated vehicles and ammunition and an inadequate number of transport helicopters for wartime.</p>
<p>The report said soldiers' training days had been slashed by two-thirds in recent years and that home front defenses against chemical and biological threats were severely inadequate in the face of an unconventional arms build-up by arch-foe Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;The picture is very worrisome,&quot; Sneh told reporters. &quot;We can't go back to the days before the Yom Kippur war when everybody thought everything was fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Egypt and Syria caught Israel by surprise in a 1973 attack which Israelis called the Yom Kippur war after the Jewish holiday on which it erupted. The Arab armies rolled back Israel's grip on occupied Arab territories which Israel recaptured at great human cost.</p>
<p>&quot;Any victory in war will cost us more in terms of lives. This is not a political issue,&quot; Sneh said. Uzi Landau, right-wing Likud party chairman of the foreign affairs and defence committee, said he backed Sneh's prognosis.</p>
<p>Shahak said Israel's ability to prevail in war was unchallenged but said more defence spending was needed.</p>
<p>&quot;We will win any war because the IDF is still equipped and organised. In order to make victory easier and quicker, we need additional -- and more than a few -- means to do so,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli military officials last week condemned a government decision to cut nearly 206 million shekels from the 30 billion 1997 defence budget. The cut dented hopes in the military for a 1.5 billion shekel hike in defence spending next year.</p>
<p>Israel has fought several wars with its Arab neighbours and still keeps troops in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and south Lebanon. Military intelligence officers have said the risk of war with Syria had increased.</p>
<p>Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been dormant since December 1995 when negotiators failed to reach agreement on the fate of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured in 1967 that Syria wants back.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to keep all of the Golan, raising fears Damascus might use force to regain by force what it cannot secure at the negotiating table.</p>
