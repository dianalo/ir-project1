<title>USA: Milwaukee stadium tax foes vow continued fight.</title>

<p>A group of Milwaukee area taxpayers said Monday they would continue their legal challenge against a tax hike to support bonds for a news professional baseball stadium despite a threat of sanctions by the government panel overseeing the project.</p>
<p>George Watts, one of the taxpayers who filed the lawsuit, held a press conference Monday in Milwaukee to lambast a letter from an attorney representing the Southeast Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District board.</p>
<p>The letter from Madison, Wis., attorney Jon Axelrod said the board would seek sanctions against the group if they file an appeal of a U.S. District Court ruling from earlier this month that dismissed the case.</p>
<p>According to the letter, those sanctions could include the payment of attorneys fees incurred by the board in defending itself in the case.</p>
<p>&quot;Plaintiffs have already cost the stadium board in excess of $50,000 in attorneys' fees,&quot; Axelrod's letted stated. &quot;Because these are public funds, the stadium board will not stand idly by if a frivolous and costly appeal is filed.&quot;</p>
<p>But the appeal to the U.S. Appellate Court in Chicago has already been filed, according to Watts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to write the court and tell them we have been threatened and we think that will go against them,&quot; Watts said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a federal court judge in Milwaukee dismissed the group's lawsuit on the grounds the Wisconsin Supreme Court had already ruled the 0.1 percent, five-county sales tax was constitutional.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the tax are slated to back $160 million of tax-exempt revenue bonds the stadium board plans to sell for the $250 million, convertible-roofed ballpark for the Milwaukee Brewers American League baseball team.</p>
<p>A municipal finance professional working on the project has said that he would recommend against selling any bonds for the stadium until the litigation is resolved in the board's favor.</p>
<p>Nelson Flynn, an attorney at Michael, Best &amp; Fredrich, the bond counsel for the issue, said Monday that a determination has not yet been made on whether the taxpayers' appeal would impede the bond sale. He said the appeal would have to be reviewed by attorneys representing the stadium board and other defendants in the case.</p>
<p>At his press conference, Watts also urged voters to question legislative candidates running in the Nov. 5 election if they would support rescinding the sales tax hike for the stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not be intimidated,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Use your vote to support candidates who will vote against...the law that taxes the defenseless so that millionaires can play baseball.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to the proceeds from the stadium board's bond issue, the project would also be financed with $50 million in loans to the Brewers from the city of Milwaukee, the local business community and two foundations, as well as $40 million from the sale of naming rights to Miller Brewing Co., upfront concession payments and a $10 million letter of credit from the American Baseball League.</p>
<p>While the stadium board approved the financing plan at its October 14 meeting, a vote on the bond resolution is not scheduled until next month.</p>
