<title>COSTA RICA: Costa Rican foreign trade minister resigns.</title>
<headline>Costa Rican foreign trade minister resigns.</headline>
<dateline>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Jose Rossi and three of his closest collaborators quit Thursday because of friction with other officials.</p>
<p>&quot;I leave content and proud of my work and thanking President Jose Maria Figueres for the opportunity that he gave me to serve the country in the fields of trade and investment,&quot; Rossi said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Deputy Minister Francisco Chacon, International Negotiations Director Anabel Gonzalez and Roberto Echando, adviser to the minister on investments and services, also resigned. Rossi said there had been disagreements with other officials on foreign trade policy.</p>
<p>Rossi clashed with Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo in mid-1996 on foreign trade issues, with Fernando having a leading role in the signing of foreign trade accords.</p>
<p>He was also marginalised during the high-profile August visit of Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
