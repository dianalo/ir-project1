<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Wednesday Germany would still qualify for the single European currency in 1999 and, despite growing budgetary problems, had planned measures to make sure it did so.</p>
<p>His comments came as government coalition sources told Reuters that tax revenues would be nearly 20 billion marks less than expected in 1997 and that Bundesbank gold reserves were being considered being put to budgetary uses.</p>
<p>The leaks came as federal, state and central bank officials met with private-sector advisers in the eastern German town of Schwerin to compile tax revenue estimates. They are to formally deliver the new tax estimate on Thursday.</p>
<p>The federal budget had originally foreseen a deficit of 53.4 billion marks, leaving Germany in line with the European economic and monetary union (EMU) target. Tax estimates made six months ago forecast 1997 revenues of 822 billion marks.</p>
<p>Waigel had said earlier that the government had a variety of measures on hand to fill the gaps.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do everything we can to fulfill the Maastricht criteria and we will fulfill them,&quot; Waigel told journalists in Bonn, referring to the criteria for EMU set in the European Union's Maastricht Treaty. &quot;We are prepared with a number of corresponding measures.&quot;</p>
<p>The euro is scheduled to be launched in 1999 by countries that meet these targets in 1997 that include limits on budget deficits, public debt and inflation.</p>
<p>Waigel said the coalition &quot;would do everything it could to avoid tax increases&quot; to fill the budget holes. He said new borrowing on top of the 53.4 billion marks ($31 billion) in debt already included in the 1997 budget &quot;cannot be ruled out.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked by reporters if new debt was unavoidable, Waigel said the high costs of supporting four million unemployed meant that new borrowing &quot;would be a logicial consequence of the facts.&quot;</p>
<p>Government coalition sources, confirming details of a German newspaper report to appear on Thursday, later said the government was considering using Bundesbank gold reserves for budgetary purposes.</p>
<p>The sources added however that the gold reserves would not be used to cover budget shortfalls but to finance investments, giving no further details.</p>
<p>According to an advance copy of a report to appear in Thursday's &quot;Handelsblatt&quot; newspaper, the Bundesbank owns around 95 million ounces of fine gold valued on average at 144 marks per ounce, for a total of 13.7 billion marks.</p>
<p>A reevaluation at current market prices of 600 marks per ounce would bring the gold's total worth up to 57 billion marks, creating some 40 billion marks of extra value, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper added the additional reserves created by such a reevaluation could at least in part be used for budgetary purposes, a move that would please government coalition members anxious to avoid the risk of tax increases.</p>
<p>Waigel, speaking earlier to journalists at a book presentation in Bonn, said the government was also considering selling part of its 75 percent stake in telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom AG earlier than the originally planned date of 2000.</p>
<p>The $13 billion sale of an inital 25 percent in November had no impact on government finances as the revenues went to the company itself. &quot;With the company's exquisite state of health a sale of shares would not be a problem,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of 35 European economists published on Wednesday showed Germany was the only country failing to make progress on achieving or bettering the Maastricht convergence targets set for membership in monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a tax revenue shortfall this year and it will be difficult to implement further cuts given high levels of unemployment,&quot; said Gernot Nerb, senior economist at Salomon Brothers Germany.</p>
<p>Otto Lambsdorff, a leader of the centrist Free Democrats that share power with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, said his party would never accept tax increases to fill the budget gaps.</p>
<p>&quot;The FDP will not accept tax increases...The missing money has to be saved in the current budget, if necessary with a spending freeze. A slightly higher increase in borrowing is better than tax increases,&quot; he said.</p>
