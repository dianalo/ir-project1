<headline>&quot;Intelligent transportation&quot; wave of future.</headline>

<p>Imagine driving down the highway at 100 mph (160 kph) in pouring rain, 12 feet (four meters) behind the car in front -- and your hands off the steering wheel.</p>
<p>You chat with friends in the back seat while a dashboard computer steers, avoids obstacles in the road and determines how best to reach your destination.</p>
<p>This is the way we will be driving in the 21st century, according to transportation industry and government officials who gathered in Orlando this week at the Third Annual World Congress on Intelligent Transportation.</p>
<p>High technology will make highways safer and more efficient, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the future and a much more strategic way of generating more efficiency out of a current system that you have in place,&quot; U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said in a speech on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans lose two billion hours per year to gridlock. Congestion costs our economy $48 billion a year. We have six-and-a-half million car crashes every year,&quot; Pena said.</p>
<p>And officials say the next decade we will see a 50 percent increase in traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;If we could warn drivers that they're too close to cars, and brakes could be automatically applied ... if we could warn drivers they're going too fast for a curve ahead ... and if drivers could detect cars in blind spots when they're changing lanes,&quot; Pena said. &quot;...if we put in those three crash-avoidance technologies, our initial analysis indicates that we could prevent 17 percent of all crashes. That's one million crashes every year.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of the technology discussed, such as fully automated vehicles in which the driver is little more than a passenger, may be years from becoming a common sight on the road.</p>
<p>But an infrastructure leading the evolution towards an intelligent transportation system is now underway.</p>
<p>Research by Carnegie Mellon University has been used in military and consumer vehicles, said Celeste Speier, spokeswoman for the National Automated Highway Consortium. The federally mandated group links nine public and private bodies researching and developing a national plan.</p>
<p>Many collision-avoidance devices have been tested and are close to being on the market, Speier said. &quot;That means if a drunk driver veers out of a lane, the steering wheel will automatically nudge the driver back into place.&quot;</p>
<p>Another consortium member, the University of California at Berkeley, has done tests with collision-avoidance devices, navigation sensors and platoons of vehicles linked by magnetic fields or radar which will eventually travel in close proximity at high speeds, making traffic flow more efficient, Speier said.</p>
<p>Initially, this technology might be applied to convoys of trucks or buses, said Christine Johnson, director of the intelligent transportation programme at the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>It will take years to phase the concepts into the general population similar to the way computers took over for typewriters, and CDs took over from vinyl record albums.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll start with cars that will remain passive and merely warn the driver through a voice prompt that he's falling asleep,&quot; said Dean Pomerleau, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>&quot;That in turn will evolve into a self-steering car which will evolve into a controlled speed car into a fully automated car&quot; that would navigate on a high-tech intelligent highway.</p>
<p>Officials also have yet to work out whether most computer intelligence should be built into cars, which is the most popular theory, or whether roadways should carry most of the data needed to control the flow of traffic, Johnson said.</p>
