<p>Portugal imported 673.3 tonnes of beef from Britain after the imposition of a European Union embargo on British beef exports, but the imports were legal, a Lisbon newspaper reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Diario Economico said that according to figures obtained from the National Statistics Institute, Portugal imported the beef from Britain between April 1996 and March this year.</p>
<p>The EU banned exports of British beef and beef products in March 1996 to protect consumer health after the British government said it was possible a human form of the fatal mad cow disease, CJD, could be caught from eating infected beef.</p>
<p>Diario Economico quoted Pedro Ribeiro, a senior Agriculture Ministry official, as saying that beef imported by Portugal had been re-exported by British companies after arriving mainly from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Argentina.</p>
<p>It quoted Ribeiro as saying the European Commission had told Portugal that it was not on the list of nations that had broken the embargo.</p>
<p>Ribeiro said imports of beef from Britain were conducted by companies &quot;authorised by the European Commission and subject to special controls.&quot;</p>
<p>The European Commission said on Wednesday it was considering legal action against Britain for illegal exports of unspecified quantities of British beef to European Union and other states.</p>
<p>EU Food Safety Commissioner Emma Bonino told Italian TV that British beef had been exported to four EU countries.</p>
<p>&quot;At the present stage of the inquiry British beef was found to have been exported to Belgium, France, Spain and the Netherlands,&quot; Bonino said.</p>
<p>Spain told its regions to put a freeze on beef that might have been imported illegally from Britain through Belgium.</p>
<p>Portuguese government officials were not immediately available to comment on the Diario Economico report.</p>
