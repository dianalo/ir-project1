<headline>Boeing, McDonnell Douglas set biggest aerospace merger.</headline>

<p>The Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp said on Sunday they plan to merge, creating what they said would be the largest aerospace company in the world in a deal worth about $13.3 billion.</p>
<p>The combined firm, to be based at Boeing's headquarters in Seattle and to operate under the Boeing Co. name, was projected to have 1997 sales of about $48 billiion, $28 billion from Boeing and $20 billion from McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>The resulting colossus would employ about 200,000 people and have a combined order backlog worth $100 billion, putting it well ahead of its nearest defense rival, Lockheed Martin Corp, and its nearest commercial aerospace competitor, Europe's four-nation Airbus Industrie consortium.</p>
<p>The stock-for-stock merger, announced in a surprise news conference, will have huge implications for Airbus Industrie, which now becomes the only other player in the business of making large commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>Boeing is now the leader in the world commercial aircraft business, Airbus second and McDonnell Douglas a distant third. Airbus was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The transaction also marks the latest move in the vast restructuring of the aerospace and defense industry that has occurred since the collapse of communism.</p>
<p>Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said in a statement they had signed a definitive agreement under which McDonnell Douglas shareholders would receive 0.65 of a share of Boeing common stock for each share of McDonnell Douglas common share.</p>
<p>Based on Boeing's closing price of $96.75 on Friday, the companies said the deal would be worth about $13.3 billion.</p>
<p>Boeing chief executive Phil Condit told reporters he would serve as the combined company's chairman and chief executive, while McDonnell Douglas chief executive Harry Stonecipher would become its president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Condit said he expected U.S. regulators to raise questions over the merger, but said he did not expect any difficulties obtaining antitrust approval. This was not expected to be &quot;a big issue,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We looked very carefully at all of our programs,&quot; Condit said. &quot;We believe that dramatically they are complementary. There are some overlaps but they're very, very minor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the military and space areas, we're absolutely complementary,&quot; Stonecipher added. &quot;There's plenty of competition in this arena.&quot;</p>
<p>Executives said the merger would cause &quot;reassignments,&quot; but said they hoped to minimize any layoffs and planned to continue operations at existing major locations, including St. Louis, where McDonnell Douglas is based.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to keep the major operating locations right where they are,&quot; Condit said. &quot;In a growing environment, there may be some reassignments to handle that growth but that will allow us to minimize the need for layoffs.&quot;</p>
<p>Condit said the companies had discussed the possibility of a merger on and off for three years, adding that &quot;the deal was really cut in the last week.&quot;</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas has long been viewed as the sick man of the aerospace industry, and has seen much of its business in the commerical aircraft area stolen away by Airbus, which was formed 25 years ago.</p>
<p>Stonecipher, who will move to Seattle after the merger is completed, implicitly acknowledged the difficulties that his company has faced in recent years.</p>
<p>&quot;We all have to be vigilant in how we go about managing growth,&quot; Stonecipher said. &quot;Managing growth is a fun thing. It can be dangerous, but it's a lot more fun than managing the downside.&quot;</p>
<p>The companies hoped to complete the merger by mid-1997, Condit said. &quot;Our best guess, and I underline the word guess because there are a lot of other agencies that have to be involved, (is) that the process will be at least a six-month kind of process,&quot; Condit said. &quot;So mid-year is sort of the target area. It could be a little shorter.&quot;</p>
<p>Boeing already has the lead position in the civil aircraft industry, historically holding a market share of about 50 percent and producing 737, 747, 757, 767 and 777 airliners.</p>
<p>It also has major defense activities, making the F-22 fighter and the Chinook and Comanche military helicopters.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas also makes a series of military aircraft, including the F/A-18 Hornet fighter, the C-17 Globemaster transport and the AH-64 Apache helicopter.</p>
