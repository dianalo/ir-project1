<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices were assessed steady on Friday with traders vague on near term market direction amid thin talks, traders said.</p>
<p>Most Japanese traders were away for holidays, keeping market discussion thin, they said.</p>
<p>High sulphur 180-cst fuel oil levels were assessed at $123/$125 per tonne Friday, unchanged from Tuesday -- the most recent trading day -- for prompt loading barrels.</p>
<p>January swaps was quoted Friday at a steady but wider $120.50/$122.00 against Tuesday's $121/$121.50. February swaps were quoted at $117.00/$118.00, unchanged from Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Fuel oil 380-cst was last assessed Tuesday at $116.00/$118.00 per tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to assess market direction, prices are probably going to stay the same as the last two weeks,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Supplies from South Korea in February are expected at around 6-7 cargoes, similar to January volumes,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Mideast cargoes seen arriving late January was mostly placed into the bunker market, they said.  </p>
<p>A local trader was heard planning to move a very large crude carrier to southern China in late January out of Singapore to meet Chinese demand.</p>
<p>Asking prices into south China were indicated at $7.50-$8.00 per tonne over Singapore spot quotes on a cost-and-freight basis.</p>
<p>While one to two local traders were expected to support prices, traders said such efforts were likely to be limited as supplies remained sufficient to meet demand.</p>
