<title>JAPAN: Tokyo naphtha spreads remain in backwardation.</title>

<p>Naphtha spreads remained in backwardation in Tokyo trade on Friday, but activity was calm as traders were unsure of market direction after Thursday's sharp turn from contango to backwardation, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's move was a little bit too much,&quot; one naphtha dealer said. &quot;Traders need some time off to wait for the market to settle down, and to find out where naphtha is headed now.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday, naphtha's inter-delivery spreads moved into backwardation for the first time in three months, prompted by market talk of a flurry of prompt buying by a Thai petrochemical firm.  </p>
<p>The Thai firm was said to have recently bought at least six 30,000-tonne cargoes for July and early August delivery.</p>
<p>First-half September open-spec naphtha was quoted at around $204.00/$206.00 a tonne, with the second half of the month indicated about $1.00 below.</p>
<p>Traders said near-term spreads are expected to remain in backwardation as long as the arbitrage window from Europe is closed.</p>
<p>In April, naphtha spreads turned into contango as an influx of European cargoes dampened sentiment for near-term lots in the regional market. --Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837</p>
