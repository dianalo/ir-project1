<p>Nippon Credit Bank's 4.6 percent five-year bank debentures due November 1997 were traded at a yield of 5.5 percent on Friday, bond traders said.</p>
<p>This compares with a yield of 6.1 percent on Monday, the last time these particular debentures were traded.</p>
<p>About 500 million yen worth of trades took place, traders said.</p>
<p>Also, about 500 million yen worth of NCB's 4.8 percent five-year debentures due October 1997 were traded at 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>Market yields of NCB debentures with a remaining life of less than one year have fallen since Thursday's announcement that NCB and Bankers Trust New York Corp had agreed on a business alliance, traders said.</p>
<p>Before the announcement, these debentures were being traded at around six percent.</p>
<p>But NCB debentures with a remaining life of more than two years were still being offered at seven percent or above, traders said.</p>
<p>For example, NCB's 4.0 percent five-year debentures due February 2000 were offered at a yield of seven percent on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment has somewhat improved since the NCB-Bankers tie-up news. But people are still cautious about buying NCB debentures with longer remaining life, as uncertainties about the bank's future still remain,&quot; said a brokerage house trader.</p>
