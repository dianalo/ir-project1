<p>Figures for latest cocoa arrivals in West Africa have poured more confusion into a market already reeling from a deluge of estimates for the 1996/97 crop.</p>
<p>But they tended to support some expert views that another big harvest is looming.</p>
<p>A repeat of last year's record outturn is unlikely, but the crop seems to be catching up fast after an initial delay that led to some bullish feelings about prices. Futures now hover near 18-month lows.</p>
<p>Analysts expect weekly arrivals in January and February to exceed last year's figures before they tail off in March and April. Already 710,000 tonnes is said to have been purchased in Ivory Coast against 800,000 tonnes received last year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lack of hard evidence really but if the arrivals are really 710,000 tonnes then we could be looking at a main crop of 950,000 tonnes,&quot; a leading UK crop analyst said.</p>
<p>Depending on the shape of the mid-crop which starts in May, Ivory Coast may gather a total crop of 1.050 million or 1.1 million this year, this source said.</p>
<p>A record harvest of 1.2 million tonnes last year has left analysts wondering if the trees entered a more productive cycle, the alternative explanation being that it was just some exceptional weather.</p>
<p>&quot;I think whatever happens it's going to be over one million tonnes. The question is how much,&quot; the analyst added.</p>
<p>Ample physical supplies from origins this season have kept a tight lid on prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought that would have been curtailing their sales by now,&quot; said one industry analyst.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the main Ivorian crop are clustered around 950,000, with Ivorian officials' views at 900,000 -- a highly unlikely scenario given the favourable growing conditions but not impossible if last year's crop is considered a fluke.</p>
<p>UK forecaster PCR Ltd has said that the main crop should be at least 900,000 tonnes, and probably more.</p>
<p>Ghana purchases have also lagged behind last year's crop initially but weekly arrivals are now coming in in larger numbers. Forecasters expect a main harvest of 290,000 tonnes this year.</p>
<p>&quot;In Ghana effectively we've had a correction. I think the (Ghana Cocoa) Board weren't declaring purchases until they'd actually taken the stuff over from the buying agents.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an unofficial series and I think that and the official one have come just about into line now.&quot;</p>
<p>Purchases totalled 213,390 tonnes by January 2 compared with 278,316 tonnes in the same period last year.</p>
<p>But despite the higher-than-expected West African output, growing consumption should still result in a substantial deficit this year, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ivory Coast production might be a little better than we anticipated, Ghana might be fractionally lower -- although the mid crop might compensate for any shortfall on the main -- but overall we're still looking at a substantial deficit,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>PCR pegged the supply shortfall at 127,000 tonnes in December while brokers GNI are looking at a deficit of some 180,000 tonnes.</p>
