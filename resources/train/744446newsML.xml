<p>Turkey's secularist government has asked deputies to lift parliamentary immunity of an Islamist MP so he can be charged over fiery speeches he made, Anatolian news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>It said the justice ministry had sent a document to the parliament speaker's office requesting that MP Sevki Yilmaz lose his immunity for &quot;inciting the people to break the law&quot; in a series of public addresses.</p>
<p>Yilmaz resigned from the Islam-based Welfare Party last month after Turkish television channels showed videos of him apparently insulting fellow MPs and criticising Turkey's secular system at public meetings.</p>
<p>Yilmaz says the tapes, some of which date back to the early 1990s, were tampered with to alter his remarks.</p>
<p>Turkey's secularist establishment has started a series of legal probes into members of the previous Islamist-led government since former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan resigned last month under pressure from the secularist army.</p>
