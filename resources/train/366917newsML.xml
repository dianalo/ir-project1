<title>USA: Stocks fall in technology sell-off; bonds, dollar weaker.</title>
<headline>Stocks fall in technology sell-off; bonds, dollar weaker.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stocks fell Monday as investors sold off technology shares, while bonds edged lower ahead of the the Treasury's quarterly auctions to fund government operations which begin Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dollar fell after a Saturday meeting of global economic officials ended with a veiled threat to halt the dollar's rally.</p>
<p>The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average closed down 49.26 points at 6,806.54, while the Nasdaq Composite index lost 22.37 points to 1,335.34.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,319 to 1,156 on active volume of 467 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Technology stocks were dealt a sharp blow after computer networking giant 3Com Corp., the second largest U.S. maker of networking equipment, warned that its results for the latest quarter would fall short of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>This triggered a freefall that spread across the sector. The stock of 3Com lost more than a quarter of its value, falling $13.50 to $37.25.</p>
<p>The sell-off extended a recent slide for major technology companies, a sector that had led the way as the market marched higher but sharply reversed course in the last few weeks as concern about their ever-increasing valuations mounted.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a case of people being afraid of a technology sell-off and deciding to ratchet down positions even if they're in them for the long haul,&quot; said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital.</p>
<p>Analysts said buyers of technology stocks had become more speculative during the latest rally, a factor they said likely contributed to the severity of the decline.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading patterns have shown this money was moving from strong hands to weak hands for several months now,&quot; said Harry Laubscher, an analyst at Tucker Anthony. &quot;In many cases it was moving out of the hands of people who held it on the way up.&quot;</p>
<p>In the bond market, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond edged down 1/32, or 31 cents on a $1,000 bond, leaving its yield unchanged at 6.70 percent.</p>
<p>In Far East trading, the dollar quickly fell toward 120 Japanese yen from 123.13 in late Friday trading and 1.64 German marks from 1.6610. But by the end of Monday trading, the dollar had rebounded to 122.76 yen and 1.6562 marks.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude oil futures rose 23 cents to $22.46 a barrel. March heating oil gained 1.23 cents to 61.76 cents a gallon, and March gasoline rose 0.47 cent to 63.53 cents.</p>
<p>April gold futures fell 90 cents to $343.10 an ounce in New York trading.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index ended 0.1 point lower at 4,307.7. In Tokyo, the key 225-share Nikkei average gained 314.13 points or 1.76 percent to close at 18,181.17.</p>
