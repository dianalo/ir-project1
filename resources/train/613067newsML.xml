<p>Alain Juppe is hoping to become the first French prime minister to lead his side to victory in a parliamentary election since 1978 -- yet risks the sack even if he triumphs.</p>
<p>To Juppe's dismay, the two-stage vote on Sunday and June 1 has partly become a referendum on his personal record and future. He had hoped it would be a vote of confidence for five years of bold action by his centre-right government.</p>
<p>Opinion polls before a blackout last weekend suggest a close contest in the National Assembly election, with the ruling coalition favourite but the opposition left within reach of an upset victory.</p>
<p>The same surveys showed fewer than 10 percent of voters want Juppe, 51 and often viewed as an unfeeling technocrat, reappointed if he becomes the first prime minister to lead his side to victory in parliament since centrist Raymond Barre in 1978.</p>
<p>That, combined with polls last year showing him to be France's least popular post-war prime minister, has made Juppe the favourite whipping boy of both anxious allies and political opponents.</p>
<p>Leftists, warning against &quot;five more years of Juppe&quot;, paint him as the embodiment of austerity and tax rises, aimed at helping France qualify for a single European currency.</p>
<p>Several fellow rightists have urged conservative President Jacques Chirac to jettison Juppe, sniping at his prickly campaign leadership and flawed programme for France.</p>
<p>Pollsters say Juppe may need a clear win to keep his job. Chirac has kept silent about his intentions, but insiders say he would like to keep Juppe, who backed Chirac for his 1995 presidential race even when others wrote Chirac off as a no-hoper.</p>
<p>Juppe, who heads Chirac's Gaullist Rally for the Republic party as well as the government, was viewed as a man of great promise when he was elevated to the Matignon office in May 1995 after two years as an admired foreign minster.</p>
<p>Two years later, he has become the focus of voters' anger over record unemployment, public spending cuts, wage freezes for state workers, persistent labour unrest, welfare cut-backs and general grumbling over unkept Chirac campaign promises.</p>
<p>Then there is his image problem.</p>
<p>Despite his brilliance, the slim, balding prime minister is widely seen as cold, hard-driving and uncaring about ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>After his approval ratings sank to record lows, Juppe tried to remedy the problem through public relations.</p>
<p>He had himself photographed in glossy magazines with his wife and infant daughter and penned a short but emotional book, &quot;Entre Nous&quot; (Between Ourselves), in which he admitted to feeling wounded by constant criticism.</p>
<p>He said he had been driven to write by a woman in Bordeaux, where he is mayor, who shouted &quot;Death to idiots&quot; at him in the street.</p>
<p>During the campaign, he has tried to take on critics more directly, often with a poignant touch of self-mockery.</p>
<p>&quot;Would it be better if I were a fat, jovial man unfamiliar with the problems, or someone who was dry and perhaps a bit less jovial but who knew them well,&quot; he said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>Asked if he felt stung by attacks, he replied: &quot;Everyone says I'm an insensitive computer, so I don't know why you're asking.&quot;</p>
<p>Possibly preparing an escape hatch for himself in case he is sacked, Juppe has alternately hinted he would be glad to leave government and happy to stay on.</p>
<p>The ambiguity has prompted opposition Socialist leader Lionel Jospin to accuse the coalition of playing &quot;cynical games&quot; by trying to fool voters into thinking Chirac would dump Juppe.</p>
<p>Born in the southwestern town of Mont-de-Marsan of modest origins, Juppe attended the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) civil service college before joining Chirac first as a speechwriter in his last weeks as prime minister in 1976.  </p>
<p>&quot;French people meant above all to say that they wanted a real change. We must listen to this message,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Real change cannot come from an eccentric coalition of Socialists, Communists, Greens, other leftists, whose programme would put us back 15 years. You can't change by adopting old ideas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To win the second round, the presidential majority...must now mobilise all citizens who want true change,&quot; he said. Polling institutes indicated the left could secure a majority in the 577-seat National Assembly in the June 1 runoff.</p>
<p>He said that the right had to hammer away at such policies as its ideas for curbing record unemployment, education and combating illegal immigration.</p>
