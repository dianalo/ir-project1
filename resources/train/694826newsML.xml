<p>Russian government officials, industrialists and energy producers hailed the first steps in a plan to cut non-payments and reduce energy costs to industry on Sunday, but said wrinkles still needed ironing out.</p>
<p>Under the plan, due to come into effect on Tuesday in Russia's central region, companies which pay in cash and in advance will be able to buy electricity at reduced rates direct from producers.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand that this is just the beginning...but having got to grips with all the details of the work of the energy system on the basis of this project we will move forward,&quot; said First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov.</p>
<p>The plan is part of a government campaign to tighten control over Russia's natural monopolies, such as natural gas producer Gazprom, national electricity company UES, and railways.</p>
<p>Officials said contracts worth more than 17 billion roubles ($2.95 million) had already been signed with 11 enterprises ready to pay cash up front for electricity, and with two power plants eager for cash -- Kostroma Hydroelectric Station and Kaliningrad Atomic Energy Station.</p>
<p>In return the enterprises would get a 20-30 percent cut in power rates.</p>
<p>The plan was drawn up by a group comprising officials and experts from the government and UES, Russia's largest company by sales, which owns and operates the national electricity grid and owns controlling stakes in most regional power plants.</p>
<p>&quot;UES experts believe that the new methods of economic optimisation in the electric power sector will allow savings of four trillion roubles ($700 million),&quot; a UES statement said.</p>
<p>Alexander Remezov, who headed the group which developed the pilot programme, said electricity rates under the new agreements would be 208 roubles per kilowatt hour, including transport and other costs, compared with the previous 350 or 400 roubles.</p>
<p>But officials and energy producers agreed that some problems with the scheme, such as continuing subsidies for household consumers, must be resolved before the electricity market can undergo real changes.</p>
<p>Households pay artificially low rates for electricity while industry pays rates several times higher than in other industrialised nations. Some groups such as the army and police pay even further reduced rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a range of serious problems -- the first is the fairly absurd legislation, from an economic point of view, where over half the consumers have favourable payment conditions or do not pay at all,&quot; said Nemtsov, who is also in charge of the fuel and energy ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;At the government meeting (on July 3) we plan to look very seriously at this problem so that in the name of the rebirth of the Russian economy the appropriate decisions will be taken on benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>The plan, which officials hope will lead to a cut in consumer prices and help fuel economic growth, will not lead to an immediate kickback for consumers, business magnates said.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say that our production will be cheaper,&quot; Georgy Gutman, chief executive of Khimprom checmical plant in the Ivanovo region near Moscow, told Nemtsov.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say something else -- over a certain time production won't get more expensive because today we're at a five percent profit margin. How can you ask us to go lower?&quot;</p>
