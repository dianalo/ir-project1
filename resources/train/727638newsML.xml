<p>The Malaysian ringgit dropped around 2.0 percent in a straight line first thing on Monday morning as the central bank decided it was time to step out of the way of the oncoming speculative train.</p>
<p>The currency hit a 16-month low against the U.S. dollar and is the latest victim, and probably the last, following weeks of speculative attacks and two de facto devaluations in Asia.  </p>
<p>The Thai baht bowed to speculative pressure on July 2 and the Philippine peso gave in on July 11 both amid worries about the economic backdrop, but analysts expected the situation to resolve itself soon and reckoned the market would calm down.</p>
<p>&quot;It's simply a spillover situation and poking your head over the parapet is a waste of time,&quot; said Tim Lucas, treasury manager at the Bank of Bermuda in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;All they are doing is stepping back...the whole thing is going to consolidate after a period of time.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bank Negara, thought to have spent more than $1.0 billion last week to shore up the ringgit, was absent from the market on Monday morning and the ringgit promptly dropped to 2.55 per dollar from Friday's close of 2.50, its lowest level since the end of February 1996.</p>
<p>The ringgit move sparked fresh sniping at the Thai baht, forcing Bangkok's central bank to stem its fall at 30.75.</p>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah also sank but quickly clawed its way back to settle at the 2,455.00 per dollar level. The Philippine peso was still looking weak at the 28.00 per dollar level.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rupiah was so quick to move that I missed it. One moment it was at 2,450 and then, whoosh, it was at 2,465,&quot; said the head of trading at a European bank in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;We're largely sitting on the sidelines on this. It's basically a temporary phenomenon.&quot;</p>
<p>Even the Singapore dollar weakened amid all the turmoil. But with a current account surplus of around 19.0 billion Singapore dollars and reserves of US$60.0 billion it make no sense for it to fall, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This will have to stop. There's a limit to where things can go. Every country in the (Southeast Asia) region has been tarred with the same brush. It's an 'en bloc' thing yet the economies are all in differing states. It's all a bit silly really,&quot; the head trader added.</p>
<p>While Bank Negara appeared to be out of the market on Monday, analysts said it would be a big mistake to believe the central bank had given up on the ringgit.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sure 2.55 is a 16-month low but it's not a level that is grossly out of proportion given the kind of flows we are seeing at the moment, it's nothing to be alarmed about,&quot; said Chiang Yao Chye, economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;At the right moment they (Bank Negara) will come in. I don't believe for one minute that they have given up on the ringgit. I don't think the speculators have won.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said currencies that held up amid the earlier turmoil were starting to look uncompetitve on the crosses.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you look to maintain currency strength surrounded by currency weakness elsewhere, all of a sudden your exports start to look very expensive,&quot; Bank of Bermuda's Lucas said. &quot;There is no point wasting reserves holding your currency up if its unsustainable, and you have the export factor to consider.&quot;</p>
<p>So what now, given there are basically no more Southeast Asian currencies to speculate against?</p>
<p>North Asia has some possible targets but only really the Taiwan and Hong Kong dollars.  </p>
<p>However, with the Hong Kong handover honeymoon still firmly in place both are seen as safe as their stock markets rally and capital flows come through to support the currencies.</p>
<p>&quot;I think north Asia seems quite well insulated at the moment, I would think this move is limited to south east Asia...and now there's none left to hit,&quot; said CIBC's Chiang.</p>
<p>The following table shows the extent of the U.S. dollar's rise against south east Asian currencies since the beginning of July.  </p>
<p>				 May 30 close    Current    pct move</p>
<p>  Dollar/Thai baht	    24.80	   30.50	+23.0%</p>
<p>  Dollar/Philippine peso    26.35	   29.55	+12.1%</p>
<p>  Dollar/Malaysian ringgit  2.5135	  2.5385     + 1.0%</p>
<p>  Dollar/Indonesian rupiah  2432.00	 2455.00    + 0.9%</p>
<p>  Dollar/Singapore dollar   1.4300	  1.4415     + 0.8%</p>
