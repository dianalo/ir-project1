<p>Cooling Hong Kong's soaring property sector has become a future government's first policy test and the decisions made could signal the direction of Hong Kong's economy under new rule.</p>
<p>In essence, Beijing-backed Tung Chee-hwa's Special Administrative Region (SAR) government must stop a &quot;bubble&quot; build up before it bursts with disastrous results for Hong Kong's property-driven economy. The challenge is how to do this without dampening real estate prices too much, a development that could lead to an economic downturn.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the new government is between a rock and a hard place,&quot; said Michael Green, property analyst at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Tung Chee-hwa and his chief property advisor C.Y. Leung inherit a colony with a critical shortage of physical property supplies, chased by a growing population.</p>
<p>&quot;If liquidity keeps coming to the residential market, (you'll have a) situation where more and more money is chasing a relatively static stock of residences,&quot; Green said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not sustainable at all, there is the potential of a bubble developing and bursting,&quot; Green said.</p>
<p>Franklin Lam, property analyst at Goldman Sachs agreed.</p>
<p>Lam said the Hong Kong property market was like opium, sucking in capital addictively and weakening other sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;When economies mature, you have a diversification of earning sectors. In Hong Kong, in the last 10 years it's gone the other way and we are increasingly courting only one sector--the property sector,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, property prices have risen 65 percent, while wages have risen by a paltry eight percent and rents by five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still arguing it's not bubble, but I think it's very very frothy,&quot; Lam said.</p>
<p>Green said property bubble bursts were undesireable and often involved the government bailing out an entire industry at the expense of the tax-paying public.</p>
<p>There are two camps equally ardent about what the government should do, possibly as soon as it is sworn in on July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe C.Y. Leung and the new government may have little choice other than to introduce a residential speculation tax,&quot; Salomon Brothers' Green said.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong's freewheeling, laissez-faire economy naturally shies away from taxes of any kind.</p>
<p>&quot;If Hong Kong introduces a sales tax or a capital gains tax, the first effect will be on the property market and prices may drop 10-15 percent,&quot; said Hong Kong Property Services (Agency) managing director Michael Choi Ngai-min.</p>
<p>If prices dropped too fast, the rest of the economy could be affected, he said, noting that 40 percent of the stock market was related to property.</p>
<p>&quot;C.Y. Leung is not the kind of person that would want to advocate dramatic interferance in the free market. What he is more likely to look at is increasing supply,&quot; Martin Tacon, senior associate at CS First Boston said recently.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's property tycoons agree.</p>
<p>&quot;(The new government) should announce a firm resolve to release a massive amount of land into the market,&quot; said Ronnie Chan, chairman of Hang Lung Development Co Ltd and Amoy Properties Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way to solve (property prices jerking up and down) is to have a steady stream of supply,&quot; he told reporters at the Foreign Correspondents' Club.</p>
