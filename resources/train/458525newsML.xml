<p>Smoking, one of the world's major killers, draws in its victims by offering a subtle but compelling high, scientists say.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the U.S.-based cigarette manufacturer Liggett Group made the astonishing move of admitting that smoking damages health and is addictive. Tobacco companies have denied this for years.</p>
<p>But doctors and anti-smoking campaigners can cite volumes of evidence that details just how smoking not only damages the body, but tricks it into begging for more.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence that it is powerfully addictive is absolutely overwhelming,&quot; said Dr Martin Jarvis, an addiction expert for the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, a British charity.</p>
<p>Of more than 61,000 people surveyed by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, 79.6 percent of daily cigarette smokers said they could not cut down. Only 66 percent of daily cocaine users said they could not.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a kind of stimulant drug, a bit like amphetamine. One of the thoughts about why cigarettes are so addictive is the route of administration,&quot; Jarvis said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you inhale it in smoke you are getting the drug hitting the brain within seven to 10 seconds, which is actually faster than if you injected it. It is also cleared from the body very rapidly so you have to keep getting yourself a hit to keep levels up.&quot;</p>
<p>Scientists are beginning to understand the effects of nicotine on the brain. It seems literally to excite brain cells.</p>
<p>One brain chemical that smoking affects is dopamine, an important neurotransmitter, or chemical that carries messages between brain cells.</p>
<p>&quot;It has something to do with reward mechanisms in the brain,&quot; said Leslie Iversen, a pharmacologist at England's Oxford University.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be a final common pathway that is activated by a whole series of drugs that people seem to like using and that includes nicotine, cocaine, alcohol, marijuana and heroin.&quot;</p>
<p>Researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, found last year that smokers had less of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO), which breaks down dopamine, than ex-smokers or people who do not smoke. This would mean more dopamine was available to their brains. Drugs such as cocaine and heroin have a similar effect.</p>
<p>Other research has shown that nicotine locks on to areas in the brain that release acetylcholine, another neurotransmitter that sets off electrical impulses in nerve and muscle cells.</p>
<p>Yet others have found it causes nerve cells to send out a larger-than-normal amount of glutamate, an excitory transmittor which, as the name implies, excites or stimulates cells.</p>
<p>Experts say about three million people die each year from smoking-related illness in developed countries, representing 20 percent of all deaths.</p>
<p>Eight different types of cancer, from lung cancer to leukaemia, are linked with smoking and smoking is the single biggest risk factor for heart disease.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobacco smoke contains a large number of chemicals that are known to cause cancer by damaging the DNA of cells,&quot; said Dr David Phillips, a research scientist specialising in molecular carcinogenesis at the Institute of Cancer Research in London.</p>
<p>These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), aromatic amines, nitrosamines and aldehydes. &quot;There's about 50 known chemical carcinogens in tobacco smoke,&quot; Phillips said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are reactive chemicals -- they bind to the DNA and alter its function. If they can cause mutations in the DNA, and we know they can, this can lead to switching on of genes that are involved in the cancer process.&quot;</p>
<p>The chemical reactions are similarly the cause behind tobacco's role in heart disease, said Dr Vivienne Press, assistant medical director at the British Heart Foundation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's associated with the formation of blood clots in the coronary arteries and it causes the heart to beat faster,&quot; she said. &quot;There is absolutely no doubt that cigarette smoke is the major cause of acquired heart disease.&quot;</p>
