<p>A man was killed in a car explosion in a densely populated Bratislava suburb early on Thursday, a Slovak interior ministry spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Barbara Kuchurova told Slovak radio she could not confirm a report by the official TASR news agency that a second person had been seriously injured by the blast.</p>
<p>The explosion, in a car park, seriously damaged other nearby cars and windows up to the 12th floor of surrounding high rise apartment blocks were shattered.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately available.</p>
<p>In February, a woman was killed by a bomb in her car in Bratislava. Two explosions in January and February destroyed a Ferrari sports car in Kosice, eastern Slovakia, and a Mercedes in Zvolen, central Slovakia, but caused no injuries.</p>
