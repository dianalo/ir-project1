<p>The St. Lucia Labour Party trounced Prime Minister Vaughan Lewis' United Workers Party in general elections on the Caribbean island, taking all but one of 17 seats at stake, poll officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lewis lost the government and his own seat in the poll on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of St. Lucia have spoken and they have spoken decisively. As the leader of the United Workers Party I accept fully the decision of the people of our country,&quot; Lewis said.</p>
<p>SLP leader Kenny Anthony, a 46-year-old legal expert, was set to form the new government.</p>
<p>The UWP has ruled the 250 sq. mile (600 sq. km) Windward Island of 143,000 people for all but three years since 1964. It gained full independence from Britain in 1979.</p>
<p>But the last few years have been marked by severe economic problems due to drops in the tourist trade and difficulties in banana production, the mainstays of the economy.</p>
<p>During electoral campaigning the SLP promised to diversify the economy and find more jobs for the people, 29 percent of whom are unemployed.</p>
<p>Chief elections officer McClair Daniel said voting turn-out might have reached 70 percent, boosted by a wave of young and female voters.</p>
