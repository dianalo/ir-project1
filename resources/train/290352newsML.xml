<p>Pontypridd's Christian Martin was sent off just 30 minutes into his debut for his part in an ugly brawl as the United States warmed up for Saturday's international against Wales with a 15-13 win.</p>
<p>The Argentine tight head prop was given his marching orders for throwing a punch but it wasn't until late in Tuesday's game that the Americans made their advantage count.</p>
<p>Pontypridd took an eighth minute lead with a try by lock Paul Owen but Mark Williams brought the Eagles back into the game with a penalty and wing Chip Curtis scored a try to send them in 8-5 up at the break.</p>
<p>The Welsh Cup winners regained the initiative in the second half thanks to a Gareth Wyatt try and a penalty from fly-half Jason Strange.</p>
<p>The Eagles had to wait until the 70th minute for the deciding score when replacement Richard Tardits intercepted a Simon Enoch pass and ran more than 40 metres to touch down.</p>
<p>Williams kicked the conversion to give the Eagles a much needed morale booster following their 39-15 mauling by Neath.</p>
<p>U.S.coach Jack Clarke said:  &quot;Our opponents came to intimidate us a little today but we weren't going to be intimidated.&quot;</p>
