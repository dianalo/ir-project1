<p>A potentially huge scandal involving millions of dollars and some of the most powerful people in Russia gathered steam on Tuesday and an influential former deputy finance minister denied he had any part in it.</p>
<p>Central Bank of Russia chairman Sergei Dubinin on Monday accused commercial bank Unikombank of misappropriating half a billion dollars in government money.</p>
<p>Dubinin said former first deputy finance minister Andrei Vavilov, removed from the ministry in a reshuffle four months ago, had approved certain payments but stopped short of accusing him of being directly involved.</p>
<p>&quot;All accusations against me are groundless,&quot; Vavilov told a news conference on Tuesday. &quot;All laws and rules have been followed.&quot;</p>
<p>The swirling allegations and denials, involving some of the biggest names in Russia's business and political elite, have sparked talk of a power struggle among the financial barons who banded together to bankroll President Boris Yeltsin's re-election last year.</p>
<p>Vavilov said he had interrupted a holiday to clear his name.</p>
<p>In the ministry since 1992, Vavilov was in charge of its hard currency department, foreign debt and public relations.</p>
<p>Dubinin said his accusations concerned the diversion of two large state payments in 1996 and 1997 intended for a regional council and MAPO-MiG, manufacturer of MiG fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>During a supervisory check of Unikombank, the central bank said it found that it was one in a chain of banks through which the Finance Ministry forwarded state funds in the form of government MinFin bonds to Moscow region and MAPO-MiG.</p>
<p>Dubinin said when Unikombank received the bonds, it sold them and kept the proceeds. The bank dismissed this as &quot;absurd&quot;.</p>
<p>Vavilov said all top officials, including the finance minister, had known about the MAPO-MiG deal.</p>
<p>He also said that during his time at the ministry he considered a number of banks had been earning &quot;too high profits&quot; on operations with cash surrogates and he had passed a formal request to the prosecutors to look into such cases.</p>
<p>He named some of the banks and companies, all of which belong to financial and industrial empires outside the huge and powerful Uneximbank group. The bank Vavilov heads is affiliated to this group, which is headed by former first deputy prime minister Vladimir Potanin.</p>
<p>The Russian media say the &quot;Vavilov case&quot; is only part of an unfolding &quot;Battle of the Titans&quot;. But all those named deny any feud or wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Last year, a group of top bankers, scared by the possibility of a Communist winning the presidential election, put aside their differences and gathered enough money to help Yeltsin win.</p>
<p>Anatoly Chubais, who masterminded Russia's privatisation programme, ran Yeltsin's campaign for a second Kremlin term.</p>
<p>Potanin, a member of the group, got a senior government post and Chubais became Yeltsin's chief of staff after the election.</p>
<p>Potanin left the government in a March reshuffle. Chubais was moved to the cabinet to spearhead reforms.</p>
