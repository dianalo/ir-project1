<p>Sweden will carry an unbeaten record and a big advantage into the medal round at the ice hockey world championship after posting a 3-1 win over the United States in their final round-robin match on Saturday.</p>
<p>Russia, the United States, Canada, Finland and the defending champions Czech Republic also qualified but because of a format that allows teams to carry points over, Sweden will already be at least one win up on the others when the medal round begins in Helsinki on Monday.</p>
<p>The United States won three games in pool B but will arrive in Helsinki with no points, as none of victories came against teams that advanced to the medal round.</p>
<p>Hosts Finland were faced with the same fate until they struck five unanswered goals to steal a 7-4 win against previously unbeaten Russia, sending both teams into the next round with two points and within sight of Olympic champions Sweden who moved on with a record of four wins and a tie.</p>
<p>While the United States easily advanced, their chances of claiming their first title in 64 years took a serious blow following their loss to Sweden.</p>
<p>Even Canada, who needed a win in their final match against Italy just to qualify, enter the next round ahead of the Americans.</p>
<p>&quot;Our first goal was obviously to get to the medal round,&quot; said U.S. coach Jeff Jackson. &quot;Now we'll just have to take it one game at a time and if the opportunity comes to take points, we'll take them.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada secured their place in the medal round with a 6-0 win over Italy.</p>
<p>Needing at least a tie to advance, Canada went to work quickly taking a 2-0 first period lead on goals by Jeff Friesen of the San Jose Sharks and Keith Primeau of the Hartford Whalers.</p>
<p>&quot;Our team was obviously determined to get to Helsinki and play for a medal,&quot; said Canadian coach Andy Murray. &quot;Hopefully we're on an upward trend in terms of our play.&quot;</p>
<p>The Canadians continued their no nonsense approach in the second as they physically overpowered the smaller Italians, increasing their advantage to 5-0 on goals from Travis Green of the New York Islanders and San Jose Sharks team mates Owen Nolan and Bob Errey.</p>
<p>Dean Evason, the only non-NHL player on the Canadian team, completed the scoring.</p>
<p>In other pool B action, Harius Vitolins scored twice as Latvia beat winless Norway 6-3 to register their first world championship victory as an independent nation since 1939.</p>
<p>In pool A, Martin Prochazka and David Vyborny each scored twice as the Czech Republic hammered France 9-3.</p>
<p>Peter Draisaitl scored with just over five minutes remaining as Germany beat Slovakia 1-0 to register their first win of the tournament.</p>
