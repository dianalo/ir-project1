<title>UK: European shares hit by Wall Street double whammy.</title>
<headline>European shares hit by Wall Street double whammy.</headline>

<p>Europe's share markets, already looking sick on the first day of new year trading, were further punished when Wall Street fell more than one percent on Thursday on renewed inflation fears.</p>
<p>The U.S. blood-letting followed a 1.5 percent tumble in New York stocks on the last day of 1996.</p>
<p>London, Europe's busiest bourse, was down 1.26 percent shortly after 1515 gmt, when French shares were off 2.38 percent. German shares closed floor trading down 1.38 percent, and were down 1.97 percent in electronic trading.</p>
<p>Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average of leading shares was down around 80 points, or 1.2 percent, on Thursday, having shed 101.10 points on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Dow actually rose slightly at its open Thursday on the back of a rise in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week -- taken as a sign that the economy was not over-heating and interest rates may not have to rise.</p>
<p>In its weekly jobless claims report, the Labour Department said new filings climbed to 366,000 in the week ended December 28, up from a revised 344,000 in the previous week.</p>
<p>But then another indicator -- the National Association of Purchasing Management's (NAPM) December report -- came in showing the U.S. economy &quot;real solid in December,&quot; raising fears that U.S. interest rates may indeed have to rise to counter the threat of rising inflation.</p>
<p>The NAPM index for December rose to 54.0, well above the forecast for 52.3.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the same old story -- the fear of rising interest rates,&quot; said one London share dealer earlier.</p>
<p>Higher rates spell bad news for highly valued share markets as returns on other investments and holding cash on deposit rise.</p>
<p>But Wall Street's latest falls barely dent its rise over the last two years, which has seen it gain over 60 percent, a run the likes of which has been seen only twice before, in 1927-28 and 1954-55.</p>
<p>The market's gains in 1996 came despite widespread predictions that inflation or weak corporate earnings would rain on Wall Street's parade.</p>
<p>European shares chased U.S. shares higher in 1996 when British stocks chalked up a gain of 11.6 percent, Frankfurt 28 percent and French shares almost 24 percent.</p>
<p>While the mood was more cautious on Thursday, many traders were still on holiday and business was relatively thin.</p>
<p>Technical analysts in London viewed the fall as simply a correction in a bull market and pegged near-term chart support for the FTSE index at 4,065, with further support at 4,050 and major psychological support at 4,000. It stood at 4,066.2 at around 1515 gmt, down 52.3 points.</p>
<p>Frence's CAC-40 index of leading shares was down 55.89 points and Germany's Ibis Dax index of pos bourse trading was down 59.38 points, or 2.06 percent, at 2,820.69 points.</p>
<p>Moves in all Europe's share markets were exaggerated by thin volume and the absence of many traders for the holiday.</p>
<p>The dollar also fell back after the NAPM data but then steadied against the mark, thought it was near the day's lows against the yen.</p>
<p>It stood at 1.5405 marks and 115.63 yen at 1515 gmt compared with 1.5385 marks and 115.85 yen late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>World oil prices began 1997 with a rally as freezing weather continued to grip much of Europe, stoking demand for winter heating oil and memories of a similar cold snap in the United States a year ago.</p>
<p>The February Brent crude oil futures contract on the International Petroleum Exchange was up 29 cents a barrel at $24.10 at around 1600 gmt, having been up 80 cents at one point.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at its lowest level since November 3, 1993 on Thursday afternoon, after light fund selling took the market lower in New York, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $366.55 per ounce after $367.80 in the morning and $369.55 at its pre-holiday fixing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1515 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.5405 marks and 115.63 yen compared with 1.5385 marks and 115.85 yen late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1515 GMT</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 52.3 points at 4,066.2.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index fell 55.89 to 2,259.84.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index fell 39.92 points to 2,848.77.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $366.55 compared with its morning fix of $367.80 and its late level of $369.05 in London on Tuesday.</p>
