<p>The Bank of Israel revised downwards its forecast for growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 1997, the director of the central bank's research department said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The original estimate saw a 4.0 percent rise.</p>
<p>Leo Leiderman of the Bank of Israel said a sharper slowdown was not expected.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no indicators that show a further deepening of the slowdown or a further recession,&quot; Leo Leiderman told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The main characteristics of the slowdown are a drop in investments and fixed assets and a decline in the rate of growth of consumption. As a result, private consumption per capita may drop this year. We may, for the first time in a long time, see an increase in private savings this year.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel also said there was a significant increase in exports, mainly in the high-tech sector, while exports in traditional industries such as textiles were declining.</p>
<p>He said tighter fiscal policy was paying off, as the current account deficit in the balance of payments is expected to fall to $3 billion to $3.5 billion from $5 billion last year.</p>
<p>He said one of the main reasons for the current slowdown was the decline in immigration. Also, the process of absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union has wound down.</p>
<p>Leiderman said the economy was also undergoing structural changes as industries moved to high-tech areas.</p>
<p>Uncertainty related to the political process and economic policy also hurt economic growth, he said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel expects unemployment to rise to 7.5 to 8.0 percent this year from 6.7 percent last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our estimate is that 1997 will be a year of adjustments and transition to a course of sustainable growth so that we have the potential in 1998 to reach a higher level of growth of three to four percent,&quot; Leiderman said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is also a good chance we will see soon an improvement in business sector profitability mainly because of a drop in long-term interest rates and an increase in unemployment which will moderate wage demands.&quot;</p>
<p>Leiderman said initial estimates called for a 1.0 billion to 1.5 billion shekel deviation from this year's budget deficit target as the slowdown has affected revenues.</p>
<p>He said the central bank will recommend in talks with the Treasury in the next few days to require not only a continuous reduction in the budget deficit target but also reduced public spending.</p>
