<p>German defence-to-engineering group Rheinmetall AG said on Wednesday it was taking a 24.99 percent stake in car components firm Kolbenschmidt in what looked like the prelude to a friendly takeover attempt.</p>
<p>The move, which surprised industry analysts, came as a German court said it was extending its study into whether British auto components engineer T&amp;N Plc could take up options on a similarly-sized stake in Kolbenschmidt.</p>
<p>Duesseldorf-based Rheinmetall said in a statement that the stake purchase from German bank Commerzbank AG was intended to create a &quot;close link (with Kolbenschmidt) with the aim of leading to management control&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Further steps this year will be made to seek industrial solutions to that end,&quot; it said, adding later that it intended to acquire a majority in Kolbenschmidt by the end of the year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Rheinmetall later confirmed that talks with T&amp;N had recently taken place on its options on Kolbenschmidt but said he could give no further details.</p>
<p>The board of Kolbenschmidt, which has annual sales of some 1.3 billion marks from car components ranging from pistons to water pumps, itself welcomed the move and said that the option T&amp;N still held on a further 24.99 percent now held no strategic importance.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome this partipication and feel in good hands (with Rheinmetall). The stalemate with T&amp;N is now over,&quot; a spokesman for Kolbenschmidt said.</p>
<p>No details were given on the price Rheinmetall is to pay for the Kolbenschmidt shares, which were earlier suspended from bourse trading. Kolbenschmidt stock has in the last two months gained more than 50 percent to trade at 26.80 marks by Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The ownership of Kolbenschmidt has been in limbo for two years. For most of that time, Commerzbank held a stake of just under 50 percent upon which T&amp;N held options.</p>
<p>T&amp;N's options on the shares to be sold to Rheinmetall have since expired. But it still holds options on the other 24.99 percent stake, which Commerzbank in December decided to transfer to the German bank Metallbank.</p>
<p>The stake is currently placed with institutional investors but Metallbank has a right to call it back as required.</p>
<p>Earlier T&amp;N chairman Colin Hope told Reuters that he was expecting some time this week a German appeal ruling to reverse an earlier decision by the German cartel office that would enable it to take up its options on Kolbenschmidt.</p>
<p>Germany's cartel authorities have so far resisted any move by T&amp;N that would position it for an outright bid for Kolbenschmidt -- something Kolbenschmidt itself has also opposed.</p>
<p>For T&amp;N, a takeover of Kolbenschmidt would position it as a rival to Germany's Mahle GmbH, the world's largest pistons manufacturer.</p>
<p>Rheinmetall said the stake purchase and its &quot;consistent development&quot; would grow its car component revenues to around 2.8-3.3 billion marks with a pre-tax profit of around 100 million marks.</p>
<p>It added that it already derives around 1.4 billion marks a year in car component sales from its Pierburg and Preh units.</p>
<p>One of the main question marks in the deal still concerns how much Rheinmetall will pay for the stakeholding -- which in turn would have a bearing on how much it would be prepared to pay for T&amp;N's options if such a situation arose.</p>
<p>Moreover, T&amp;N still retains title to half any profits Commerzbank makes from selling the shares at any price above 14 marks per share.</p>
<p>Werner Friedmann, engineering analyst at Frankfurt-based Bank Julius Baer, said that Rheinmetall had shown from past deals that it did not like to pay over-generously.</p>
<p>&quot;Particularly given the recent rise in Kolbenschmidt shares we should not assume there will be much of a premium (on market price of 26.80 marks),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But even at market levels. that would none the less compensate T&amp;N for the costs of carrying the options, which resulted in an exceptional charge of 25 million pounds in 1996, T&amp;N's Hope earlier said.</p>
<p>Lothar Mark, head of Metallbank, said in a phone interview that T&amp;N was in a comfortable position, with options extending from an outright sale of its stake to a proposal to Rheinmetall that the two cooperate on Kolbenschmidt.</p>
<p>Separately, the German Court of Appeals said it was extending until April 15 its study into whether T&amp;N should be allowed to take a strategic interest in Kolbenschmidt.</p>
