<headline>RUGBY UNION-Vidiri says vindicated by selection.</headline>

<p>Selection in the New Zealand Barbarians rugby team for a two-match tour of Britain next month was a huge relief to Counties-Manukau winger Joeli Vidiri.</p>
<p>Being named in the 23-strong tour squad this week vindicated his decision to turn his back on his native Fiji and switch his allegiance to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Vidiri parted ways with the Fiji Rugby Football Union more than two years ago, saying that Counties were prepared to invest more time and effort into him.</p>
<p>His decision caused consternation in Fiji and the pressure went on him to return.  </p>
<p>Vidiri, 23, ignored the pressure but even this year he has received unsubtle reminders from some Fijian players they think he should be playing for Fiji.</p>
<p>Fijian representatives -- King Country fullback Phillipe Rayasi, Waikato wing Aisea Tuilevu and Waikato hooker Greg Smith -- have all gone out of their way to deliver the message, on the field.</p>
<p>Vidiri, though, is comfortable with his decision, even more so now that he has been included in the Barbarians team.</p>
<p>It seemed an All Blacks jersey beckoned when he was named in the All Blacks squad last year.  </p>
<p>But Vidiri's promotion was stalled when the International Rugby Board (IRB) ruled he had to serve a three-year stand-down period before being eligible to play for another country. He is not eligible for All Blacks selection until April 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;That part's been frustrating, sometimes it was really hard,&quot; Vidiri said.</p>
<p>&quot;I just couldn't sit still and watch last year's World Cup, I just kept thinking that I really wanted to be there with them.&quot;  </p>
<p>When he was named in the New Zealand Barbarians team this week to tour Britain, along with another player who is affected by the same IRB rule -- Auckland's Dylan Mika -- Vidiri said his decision finally felt right.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm really happy to be picked for the Barbarians. I know now that my decision to go with New Zealand was the right one,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels like everything has been worthwhile.&quot;</p>
