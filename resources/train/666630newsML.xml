<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks advance to new record close.</title>

<p>Mexican stocks ended up at their fourth record close in a row on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers and analysts said stockpickers stepped in to buy after an earlier bout of moderate profit-taking had made prices cheaper. &quot;The market still looks strong. I honestly expected more profit-taking, but the bourse absorbed selling very well when buyers took advantage of lower prices,&quot; said a stock promoter who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Final closing prices situated the blue chip IPC share index  .MXX up 15.21 points on the day, or 0.36 percent, at a new record close of 4,259.84.  </p>
<p>&quot;Several stocks are well priced and fundamentally sound,&quot; the promoter added.</p>
<p>Dealers stressed the market was quiet, and moderate buying had an exaggerated effect amid thin volume.</p>
<p>&quot;The market got a second wind. Earlier selling was not heavy, and dealing was quiet,&quot; one floor trader said.</p>
<p>Trading volume  .TV.MX was restrained at just 85.5 million shares traded, and dealers noted one hefty cross trade accounted for more than 10 percent of that total.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was dull. There was no overall trend, apart from financials, which were strong,&quot; a desk trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Financials are still cheap. They've had a terrible time over the last two years,&quot; a floor trader said. &quot;They could finally be waking up.&quot;</p>
<p>Bancomer, one of Mexico's biggest financial groups, was the most heavily traded gainer. Its B shares ended up 10 centavos to 3.80 peso, while the A shares gained 8 centavos to 2.05 pesos. The two share classes accounted for 22 percent of all shares traded.</p>
<p>Dealers also drew attention to retail chain Comerci, which climbed 48 centavos to 6.86 pesos at brisk trade to head the prominent gainers' list.  </p>
<p>&quot;Comerci had lagged far behind recent market gains,&quot; a floor trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said some stocks, notably tortilla and corn flour firm Maseca, had not recovered from earlier profit-taking. Maseca shed 6 centavos to end at 8.08 pesos.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 106 stocks changed hands in total, of which gainers narrowly outpaced sliders by 45 to 42.</p>
