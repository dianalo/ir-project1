<p>Syria's central bank on Tuesday announced the adjustment of the pound's neighbouring countries rate to become 45 pounds to a U.S. dollar from 43.5 pounds &quot;as part of the government's moves to unify the exchange rates against foreign currencies&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The adjustment came also as a result of the improvement in the monetary situation in the country and the stability in the value of the pound,&quot; a statement issued by the central bank said.</p>
<p>According to the new adjustment, effective July 15, the selling rate will become 45.5 pounds to a dollar from a previous rate of 44 pounds to a dollar , it added.</p>
<p>The neighbouring countries rate, one of several exchange rates used in the country, covers over 75 percent of the dealings, economic sources said.</p>
<p>Other rates include the official rate, which stands at 11.2 pounds to a dollar and is restricted to certain government transactions.</p>
<p>The central bank said nine decrees were issued during the last 18 months to &quot;simplify and unify the exchange rates&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The new adjustment, the second in nine months, reflects the flexibility which the monetary authorities are adopting to meet real market forces and to promote further stability in the value of the national currency,&quot; the central bank said.</p>
<p>Economic sources described the new decision as &quot;positive&quot; and that other measures were needed to free pound's rate to reflect the real market value.</p>
<p>&quot;The pound's value on the black market has been stable at between 49 and 51 pounds to a dollar during the last six years, one of the signs which encourages the government to free the pound's rate,&quot; one economic source said.</p>
<p>The central bank said it was continuing its economic reform and more positive measures were being adopted to improve economic activities in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Several financial and monetary measure are currently being adopted to create real balances that would promote the financial and monetary stability and activate the various economic activities and enhance the development process to higher levels,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It did not give details but mentioned a decision issued late last year in which Syrians and expatriates were allowed to open accounts in hard currencies in local banks without being asked about the source of these funds.</p>
<p>The decision was a breakthrough as it automatically cancelled articles of Law Number 24 which bans dealing in hard currency by locals and imposes harsh penalties on violators.</p>
