<p>Mother Teresa, recovering from life-saving heart surgery, had a peaceful night in intensive care and her condition was unchanged, a hospital official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother Teresa had a good sleep,&quot; said S.K. Tiwari, administrator of Calcutta's B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre, where Mother Teresa was being treated.</p>
<p>&quot;Her condition remains unchanged,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old Roman Catholic nun has been suffering from an irregular heartbeat, bronchial pneumonia and weak kidneys.</p>
<p>She had surgery last week to clear two blocked arteries and had appeared to be recovering when longstanding kidney and lung problems resurfaced.</p>
<p>Doctors said on Tuesday they were optimistic the nun would recover, but cautioned that she remained in critical condition and was still not out of danger.</p>
<p>They said she could take a long time to recover, and might never be as active as before.</p>
<p>The nun, who was fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989, had her first heart operation in the United States in 1991 and her second at the Birla centre in 1993.</p>
