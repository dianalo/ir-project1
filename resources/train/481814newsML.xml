<title>USA: ABC Rail sees Q3 results below estimates.</title>

<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-02</dateline>

<p>ABC Rail Products Corp said Wednesday results for its fiscal third quarter ending April 26 would be significantly below the consensus analyst estimate of $0.52 per share due to a number of operating factors that were temporarily depressing earnings.  </p>
<p>In the same quarter last year, the company had a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.30 per share.</p>
<p>D. Chisholm MacDonald, chief financial officer, told analysts attending an investor conference in New York that although orders were stronger than anticipated, a combination of factors were converging to hamper operations.</p>
<p>Among the factors were several facility and process upgrades designed to streamline ABC Rail's manufacturing operations and reduce costs, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Considering what's going on, the quarter won't be all that bad,&quot; he said in a company press statement. &quot;But it certainly won't measure up to our earlier expectations or those of the Street.&quot;</p>
<p>MacDonald added that output was slowed at the company's Superior, Wis., and Newton, Kansas, trackwork plants and its Pueblo, Colo., and Chicago Heights, Ill.,  plants. He said the &quot;complete re-design of track turnout products resulting from the recent large Western railroad mergers&quot; had slowed the output.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have been slow in closing a money-losing plant acquired as part of our May 1996 acquisition of Deco Industries,&quot; MacDonald also said.</p>
<p>&quot;Progress in bringing the recently re-built Calera wheel manufacturing plant up to speed also has been slower than anticipated,&quot; he added, according to the company.</p>
<p>The company's shares were down 2-5/8 to 14-3/4 in late trading Wednesday.</p>
