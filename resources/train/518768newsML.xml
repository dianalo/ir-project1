<p>Norway's all-share index was flat in lacklustre trade on Thursday but telecommunications group Nera tumbled on exaggerated profit forecasts.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total index closed 0.07 percent higher at 1,071.88 points in light turnover of 777 million crowns.</p>
<p>Volume was inflated earlier this week by heavy trade in banks engaged in takeover battles, including Fokus Bank which finished 0.7 percent off at 72.50 crowns.</p>
<p>Nera was the most traded share at 88 million crowns and closed 9.0 percent lower at 323 crowns after slipping throughout the session amid talk of first-quarter profits due next week.</p>
<p>The share fell further after Nera said it expected results to be roughly in line with the result of the year-ago period, when Nera booked a pre-tax profit of 26.6 million crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;Market consensus was for a pre-tax profit of around 50 million crowns, but it turns out it will be roughly half of that,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The outlook was uncertain given U.S. interest rate trends.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit on cyclical shares, oil shares, and some shipping stock. Be careful with shares that have high p/e ratios. They are in general sensitive to interest-rate changes,&quot; he said.</p>
