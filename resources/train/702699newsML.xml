<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve opted on Wednesday to hold interest rates steady amid signs economic growth has slowed from a sizzling first quarter pace.</p>
<p>The announcement, which came at the end of a two-day meeting of the central bank's policy-making committee, had been widely expected and left the key federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight money at 5.50 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1155 a.m. (1555 GMT),&quot; central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said. &quot;There is no further announcement.&quot;</p>
<p>The guessing game had already begun about what the Fed will do at its next policy-making meeting on August 19. Some analysts see it raising rates as growth picks up from a second quarter lull. But others expect no change.</p>
<p>The central bank last altered monetary policy in March, when it raised the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to keep the economy from overheating and to contain inflation.  </p>
<p>Since the March rate increase, economic growth has slowed markedly as consumers have cut back on their purchases after an early-year spending spree. Analysts expect growth in the second quarter to come in at a 1-1/2 to two percent annualized pace, compared with a 5.9 percent rate in the first quarter.</p>
<p>In the latest sign of slowing growth, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that factory orders tumbled by 0.7 percent in May after rising by 1.4 percent in April. Weak demand for new cars and airplanes was behind the fall.</p>
<p>Analysts said that politics also argued against a rate rise now. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is slated to present the Fed's semi-annual assessment of the economy to Congress on July 22 and he would have found it hard to defend a rate hike to lawmakers when growth is slowing and inflation is low.</p>
<p>The Fed's March rate rise was met with what Greenspan himself has acknowledged was an unusual amount of criticism, from an unlikely alliance of Democratic and Republican lawmakers and business and labor leaders.</p>
<p>The central bank's next move will depend on how the economy performs after its second quarter slowdown.  </p>
<p>&quot;The whole issue for both the markets and the Fed is whether the pause in second quarter growth will persist,&quot; David Jones, Vice-chairman of Wall Street broker Aubrey G. Lanston and Co., said.</p>
<p>With the jobs market already very tight and many factories running flat out, a sharp economic rebound in the third quarter would raise the risk of higher inflation, possibly prompting the Fed to tighten credit in response.</p>
<p>Many economists believe that is exactly what will happen. With wages rising and the stock market strong, they said that consumers have the wherewithal to step up spending, boosting economic growth in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic activity will pick up steam in the third quarter and that will prompt the Fed to act,&quot; said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp.</p>
<p>Others though see growth settling into a sustainable pace of around two to 2-1/2 percent in the second half of the year, allowing the Fed to stay on hold. They argue that consumers have already sated their demand for big-ticket items such as cars and are unlikely to go on another spending spree.</p>
<p>&quot;Some pick-up in consumer spending will almost certainly occur, but we just don't see consumers bingeing out again,&quot; Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at broker Merrill Lynch and Co., said.</p>
