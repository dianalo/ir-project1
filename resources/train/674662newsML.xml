<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper prices are expected to consolidate later on Thursday, before resuming their upward drive dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper needs a correction to ease the current technically overbought position,&quot; a trader at a local brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) for three-month copper was standing at 75.43 percent on Thursday, compared with 74.01 on Wednesday and 76.11 percent a week ago.</p>
<p>The market generally considers an RSI of 70 or more as overbought and 30 or less as oversold.  </p>
<p>It said these reports were strenuously denied by the company, and appeared to be based on little more than Alcan's recent announcement that it was recruiting more workers at its smelter in Sebree, Kentucky. About 66,000 tonnes of the plant's annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes has been idled.</p>
<p>Brandeis said an LME aluminium close above $1,600 was still needed to provide further upward momentum, with the next resistance level seen at around $1,605/$1,610. Nearby support was seen at $1,565.  </p>
<p>Three-month aluminium bid prices rose slightly to $1,594 at 0500 GMT in thin Asian trade on Thursday compared with Wednesday's late LME close of $1,593.</p>
<p>Brandeis said zinc prices were expected to remain rangebound and unable to breach resistance at $1,380 despite good support at $1,367/$1,368 provided by the 10-day moving average.</p>
