<p>Midwest-based U.S. newspaper companies, benefitting from plummeting newsprint prices, are expected to report strong third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting double-digit earnings growth across the board,&quot; said PaineWebber media analyst William Drewry.</p>
<p>Employment demand continued to be strong, driving help wanted advertising results, Drewry added. He also noted that display advertising was doing better than many had expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Top line growth in the (newspaper) sector has held its ground,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Lauren Fine.  </p>
<p>Multi-media giant Tribune Co was paying about $590 per metric ton of newsprint, after a peak of $735 per ton in the first quarter, said Nesbitt Burns analyst James Goss. The average newsprint price it paid during 1995 was $650 per ton.</p>
<p>Tribune also continued to build strength through broadcasting and educational media acquisitions, analysts said.</p>
<p>Steven Barlow of Smith Barney said an analysts' briefing with Tribune management last week reenforced his view that the company's acquisition strategy was &quot;focused rather than willy-nilly.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said easy comparisons on newsprint versus a year ago should also help third-quarter results at Indianapolis, Ind.-based Central Newspapers Inc and St. Louis-based Pulitzer Publishing Co.</p>
<p>But moves into electronic publishing and use of the Internet as a vehicle for selling advertising are unlikely to have a meaningful impact for some time.</p>
<p>John Morton, a Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan analyst, said most newspaper-oriented companies are testing the Internet's potential. &quot;It's still a drop in the bucket and in five years it'll probably be five drops in the bucket,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Clearly it (the Internet) will be important some day,&quot; said Morton. And newspapers, with their strong data bases, are uniquely equipped to do well in the electronic arena, Morton added.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch's Fine said Chicago-based Hollinger International Inc should post a strong quarter, though she had no formal estimate in part because of a restructuring the company underwent last year. In the 1995 third quarter, it reported earnings of $0.12 per share.</p>
