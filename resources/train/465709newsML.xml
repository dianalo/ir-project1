<p>Zimbabwe expects a bumper crop harvest next month despite weather and disease-related problems and industry officials said on Tuesday prospects were good for higher maize exports.</p>
<p>They told Reuters that output of the staple maize was forecast to remain at last year's 2.6 million tonnes, 200,000 tonnes down from earlier predictions after crops suffered severe water-logging and others were damaged by grey leaf disease.</p>
<p>&quot;The heavy rains this season (November-April) brought us some problems, but the outlook is still generally good,&quot; said Nick Swanepoel, president of the main Commercial Farmers Union (CFU).</p>
<p>Zimbabwe's agriculture-powered economy is forecast to grow by up to eight percent this year, up from six percent in 1996 on the back of a 12 percent rise in the farming sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at bumper harvests almost all-round, and naturally to big stocks and an increase in some of our exports, especially maize,&quot; Swanepoel said.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe has exported some 400,000 tonnes of maize from its 1996 crop.</p>
<p>Swanepoel declined to go into details on the export prospects, saying: &quot;We will have a clearer idea of the definite facts and figures in the next two or so months&quot;.</p>
<p>Before the crop was hit by water-logging and grey leaf disease, Swanepoel and other top industry officials, including Agriculture Minister Denis Norman, were forecasting an output of around 2.8 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;It has turned out differently,&quot; said Ian Gibson, chairman of the CFU's sub-group, the Commercial Grain Producers' Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Our members are fighting to control diseases to keep whatever figures we are talking about,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) also revised estimates for this year's flue-cured tobacco to a record 205 million kgs from initial expectations of an even larger crop of 235 million kgs, saying the crop had also been hit by water logging and lack of sunshine.</p>
<p>The country produced some 202 million kgs of flue-cured tobacco last year and remains the world's third largest producer of tobacco after the United States and Brazil.</p>
<p>Sugar production is expected to rise to over 600,000 tonnes this year from 513,000 tonnes in 1996.</p>
