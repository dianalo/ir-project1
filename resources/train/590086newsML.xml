<title>PHILIPPINES: Manila grains buyers await further price dips.</title>

<p>Philippine grains buyers encouraged by softer wheat prices are expected to revert back to the market next week but are still chancing on further price tumbles.</p>
<p>&quot;Some traders still feel that prices can still go lower and you'll see them pounce in the market once prices do,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The fall of U.S. wheat, corn, soyoil, soybean and soymeal prices this week due to a USDA report of better-than-expected carryover stocks inspired flour mills in Manila who said they would soon venture into the market.</p>
<p>Last week, Philippine flour mills sent tender invitations for 90,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat but only one mill bought 7,500 tonnes of soft wheat due to higher offers.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday, a Philippine mill bought 16,000 tonnes of Canadian dark northern spring wheat, 7,000 tonnes of U.S. western white wheat and 7,000 tonnes of soybean for August delivery.</p>
<p>A senior trader said one mill was also negotiating for a 25,000 tonne of U.S. wheat for June delivery but is waiting for prices to weaken further.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for price breaks,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Imports for corn and rice are not expected next week as supplies are sufficient, government officials said.</p>
<p>The state-run National Food Authority said the country's rice stocks as of end-April reached 1.60 million tonnes compared with 1.44 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The prevailing flour and corn prices in Manila in pesos:</p>
<p>						   May 15	May 9</p>
<p>Hard flour wheat per 25 kg		 290	   290</p>
<p>Soft flour wheat per 25 kg		 260	   260</p>
<p>Retail price of yellow corn per kg     9.67	  9.72</p>
<p>Retail price of white corn per kg	9.90	 10.15</p>
