<p>Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Monday he was optimistic India and Pakistan would slowly strengthen cooperation as South Asia moves towards creating a free trade zone.</p>
<p>&quot;Compulsions of history are now making all of us in South Asia to understand that cooperation is a must,&quot; Gujral told Asian News International (ANI) in an interview when asked to comment on India's relations with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Gujral spoke on Monday morning before negotiators in Islamabad said India and Pakistan had agreed to set up working groups to tackle all outstanding issues dividing the threshold nuclear powers, including their dispute over Kashmir.</p>
<p>The Indian leader noted that the seven member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) had agreed last month to move up a deadline for creating a free-trade bloc to 2001 from 2005.</p>
<p>He also noted that Pakistan had offered to sell 3,000 megawatts of surplus power to electricity-starved northern India. &quot;We are looking at negotiating that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore with this background I think we are moving, though the speed may be slow because confidence-building is required, removal of suspicions is required, removal of doubts is required, and therefore we are moving towards that, and I'm optimistic about it,&quot; he said.</p>
