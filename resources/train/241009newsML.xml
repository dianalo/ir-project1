<p>Swedish shares ended off day lows on Friday in relief after Wall Street did not open as low as feared.</p>
<p>The exchange's general index fell 1.58 percent to 2,287.35 from a day-earlier record high. But the index recovered late in the session from a day low of 2,235.19.</p>
<p>In line with market trends, drugs major Astra rebounded somewhat from day lows and ended 4.5 crowns lower at 332 crowns after rising nine crowns on Thursday.</p>
<p>Telecommunications group Ericsson dropped 4.5 crowns to 199 crowns.</p>
<p>Astra and Ericsson dominated the trade with 2.1 billion crowns of total turnover, which landed at the high level of 6.25 billion crowns.</p>
<p>During the day, the market was depressed by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warning of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infecting financial markets.</p>
<p>But dealers and analysts expect the downturn to be shortlived and see the market stablising in a few days.</p>
<p>Among sectors, the building and construction and forestry groups were the hardest hit, down 2.22 percent and 2.11 percent, respectively.</p>
