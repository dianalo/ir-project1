<p>CBOT soy product futures closed higher on a rally in soybeans that was triggered by buying of March $7.25 soybean calls, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said Refco Inc bought 800 March $7.25 calls and that action, plus outright fund demand for the March soybean contract contributed to the advances in the soy complex.</p>
<p>Soyoil also was bolstered on Tuesday by the presence Monday of commercial buying during the aggressive selling spree by funds, expecially Griffin Trading, they said. Traders said the commercial posturing Monday kept selling away Tuesday.</p>
<p>Soymeal also found support from the gains in soybeans but gains also came from renewed talk China may be seeking soyoil and soymeal, the traders said.</p>
<p>Soyoil futures volume was estimated at 12,000 contracts, below the 28,898 traded Monday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>Soymeal futures volume was estimated at 10,000 contracts, below the 15,573 traded Monday.</p>
<p>Soyoil closed 0.04 to 0.25 cent per lb higher, with January up 0.25 at 23.04. Soymeal closed $1.40 to $2.40 per ton higher, with January up $2.40 at $232.90.</p>
