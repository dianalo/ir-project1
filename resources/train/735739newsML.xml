<p>Some Australian stocks to watch this morning:</p>
<p>* Australis Media Ltd A$0.20 (+0.055)</p>
<p>* News Corp Ltd A$6.34 (+0.10)</p>
<p>Shares in pay television operator Australis Media Ltd jumped 5.5 cents or 35 percent to 20 cents in hectic closing trade on Thursday fed by speculation of an imminent announcement of a merger with Foxtel, brokers said. Soon after the market closed, Australis' shares were suspended pending Australis' repsonse to an Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) query, the ASX said.</p>
<p>* ICI Australia Ltd A$12.68 (+0.13)</p>
<p>Imperial Chemical Industries Plc (ICI) said on Thursday it had been notified that the over-allotment option had been fully exercised in the float of its majority stake in ICI Australia Ltd (ICIA). The option allows for the purchase of around 12 million shares at A$12.35 each to cover over-allotments.</p>
<p>* Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd A$18.46 (+0.27)</p>
<p>BHP said in its monthly production report released late on Thursday its total copper concentrates output fell nine percent to 50,200 tonnes in June from 55,200 tonnes a year earlier. BHP's Queensland coal production fell one percent in June compared with a year earlier, while iron ore output from Western Australia fell two percent. Gas output in June was down 11 percent on June 1996, while crude oil and condensate output was down five percent. Steel despatches for June slipped one percent and that its raw steel output fell five percent in June compared to June 1996.</p>
<p>* Qantas Airways Ltd A$2.93</p>
<p>Qantas Airways is hoping to win permission from Beijing for new air routes over China that will significantly cut flight times to Europe and allow increased payload, a Qantas official told Reuters. Senior Chinese government officials travelled to Sydney in May to meet Qantas executives and Australian government officials to discuss new routings over southwest China and the norther Himalayas. The Australians are awaiting a decision, he added.</p>
<p>* PMP Communications Ltd A$3.21 (+0.05)</p>
<p>The Australian Securities Commission said brokerage firm JB Were and Son had agreed to reduce its stake in magazine publisher PMP Communications Ltd to five percent from 10.28 percent currently. An ASC spokeswoman said the independent broker, one of Australia's largest, had allegedly breached the Corporations Law by not seeking relief from rules which prevent ownership of more than 20 percent of a company in which it had a relevant interest.</p>
