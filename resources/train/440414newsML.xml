<title>CANADA: Canada apologizes to Micmac Indian on feather.</title>
<headline>Canada apologizes to Micmac Indian on feather.</headline>

<p>Canada's House of Commons apologized on Wednesday to a Micmac Indian teen-ager who was stopped from entering the House of Commons for holding an eagle feather.</p>
<p>&quot;I extend the apologies of this house,&quot; Gilbert Parent, the speaker of the House, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Melissa Labrador, 17, was stopped from entering the public gallery of the House of Commons on Tuesday after a guard told her she might injure somebody by throwing the feather at members of Parliament seated below the gallery.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is permissible for an aboriginal to bring a feather into this house. It was a mistake. It will not happen again,&quot; he said, adding that he has aboriginal roots too.</p>
<p>Spectators have not usually been allowed to bring anything into the gallery, the speaker's office said.</p>
<p>The young Indian from Nova Scotia, in Ottawa for the first time to participate in a youth forum, left Parliament in tears. &quot;I wanted to hold the feather to show people that I am aboriginal,&quot; she told the Ottawa Citizen. &quot;I'm not going to hide who I am.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she brought the feather to fight homesickness during her visit to the big city. &quot;It means a lot to me because the eagle flies closest to the creator, above the clouds,&quot; she told the newspaper.</p>
<p>One guard did eventually decide to allow Labrador in the House, but she declined.</p>
