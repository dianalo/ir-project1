<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said on Thursday it should hold funds accumulated through the recently-announced import deposit plan to help keep the funds out of the money supply.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding our monetary policy, we think that these funds should not go to the banking sector, but that they should be held in the central bank,&quot; NBS Governor Vladimir Masar told journalists.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the government announced a plan requiring importers to deposit 20 percent of the value of selected imported goods on interest-free accounts for 180 days.</p>
<p>Masar added the measure could add to the central bank's efforts to reign in the money supply if the funds are held at the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;If the funds collected are kept out of the money supply, it would be a further sterlisation measure and we could then consider easing monetary policy, through, for example, lowering minimum reserves requirements, Masars said.</p>
<p>Masar said he would present the NBS's view on how to use the deposited funds at the government's session next Tuesday, but he would not say whether the central bank would explicitly demand the deposits to be held in the NBS.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik said earlier in the day that the government and the central bank were holding duscussions over changes to monetary policy, though &quot;no conclusions have come from the talks so far&quot;.</p>
<p>Masar said the NBS was not considering any rate cuts at the moment.</p>
