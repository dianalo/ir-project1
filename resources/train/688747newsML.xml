<p>Russian oil companies eyeing a major slice of Iraqi oil sold under a U.N. oil-for-food pact are awaiting the U.N.'s final go-ahead before signing deals, a senior Russian oil official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are awaiting the U.N.'s decision,&quot; said Yuri Agababov, deputy chief executive at Russian trading company Zarubezhneft, which lifted oil under the first 6-month deal and coordinated liftings for the other seven Russian companies involved.</p>
<p>He said Russian companies had met Iraqi oil officials regularly over the last few months to discuss deals.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian companies are regularly meeting with Iraqi officials in Baghdad,&quot; he said. &quot;Different companies have been meeting at different times. They are simply commercial talks and are not carried out by one particular group.&quot;</p>
<p>Agababov would not say when he expected liftings under a new deal to begin. He said Iraq had promised that an aid distribution plan, which provides for renewed U.N.-supervised oil sales, would be ready within 10 days.</p>
<p>Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Rasheed told a news briefing on Thursday the plan would be ready in about seven to 10 days.</p>
<p>New price formulas for the second phase of oil sales contracts would be available two to three days after the aid distribution plan was approved.</p>
<p>Russian companies bought nearly 28.54 million barrels of Iraqi oil under the first 180-day, $2-billion programme, 23.5 percent of the total 121.6 million or so barrels Baghdad was allowed to export under the first deal.</p>
<p>Agababov and sources at other Russian companies which lifted Iraqi oil under the first deal have said they are aiming to lift around the same volumes under any new agreement, or possibly slightly more.</p>
