<p>The Polish zloty closed just up against the basket of currencies, after a day mostly sideways drift, gently buoyed by small-scale foreign zloty purchases and some exporters' orders, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said trade was stiffled by market holidays on Thursday and Friday which moved the value date of spot zloty deals to Monday -- different than today's spot dollar/mark value date.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was quiet and towards the end of the day there were some small scale foreign purchases of zlotys, which I had expected on Monday, but which surprisingly came only today,&quot; said Piotr Czyzewski of ING Bank.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 2.53/2.50 percent from the parity rate, up from 2.49/2.46 percent on Monday. It was at 3.1575/00 against the dollar up from 1.1630/40 on Monday and 1./8270/85 against the mark down from 1.8255/65.</p>
<p>Dealers said the National Bank of Poland, which has been stressing it did not want the zloty to rise past 2.5 percent from the trdaing band centre, was checking rates on the interbank market, but did not intervene.</p>
<p>On the money market overnight rates fel to 10.0/18.0 percent at close as many banks were left with extra cash on the last day of April reserve. @</p>
<p>Tomorrow/next rates rose to 23.15/23.85 percent from 21.0/23.0 percent as banks searched for cash to pay tomorrow for T-bills bought on Monday and to keep high average reserve levels over the long weekend at the start of the May reserve.</p>
