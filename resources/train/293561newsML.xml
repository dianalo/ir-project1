<p>Watch and jewellery products manufacturer and distributor Egana International (Holdings) Ltd expects jewellery operations to contribute about 50 percent of the company's sales revenue in three to five years' time.</p>
<p>&quot;We will gradually expand our jewellery business, taking advantage of a relatively cheaper labour cost in Asia,&quot; said Egana's chairman Hans-Joerg Seeberger in a press briefing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;And in three to five years' time, we anticipate 50 percent of our sales revenue to be from timepieces and 50 percent from jewellery,&quot; Seeberger said.</p>
<p>Jewellery operations currently contribute just over 22 percent of the company's turnover, said director David Wong.</p>
<p>Seeberger said he expected strong growth in consumer spending for luxury products in Asia and the United States in coming years while Europe would remain as a mass market for the goods.</p>
<p>&quot;We will consider a spinoff of our jewellery operation in future if the time is appropriate,&quot; Egana's executive director Peter Lee said. &quot;However, we do not have any detail planning on the spinoff at this stage.&quot;</p>
<p>In order to expand its jewellery business, Lee said the company had bought a 45 percent stake in Thai jewellery maker and distributor Keimothai Ltd for about HK$10 million from Keimothai's 92.5 percent controlling founder Kurt Keller.</p>
<p>Keimothai manufactures and distributes fine jewellery. Its customers include Christ Holding GmbH and Tiffany.</p>
<p>The company had said the purchase would expand the geographical coverage of its jewellery products to Thailand and strengthen the relationship with Christ, a company which has over 450 jewellery and timepiece retail chain stores in Germany and Switzerland.</p>
<p>In December, Seeberger placed 15 million Egana shares, or about a one percent stake, at HK$1.93 each to Christ. Seeberger continues to hold 53.3 percent of Egana after the deal.</p>
<p>Christ is 65.5 percent controlled by Douglas Holding AG which has more than 1,800 specialist stores all over Europe.</p>
<p>Seeberger said a strengthening relation with Christ and Douglas Holding would pave the way to further expand its distribution network in Europe.</p>
<p>Seeberger said Egana would continue to expand its retail network in the U.S. and explore sourcing business cooperation opportunities in Asia.</p>
