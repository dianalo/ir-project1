<p>Bob Dole, who lost the presidential race last year to Bill Clinton, left the door open in remarks broadcast Monday to a possible White House bid by his wife.</p>
<p>Dole, in an interview taped last week for the NBC television programme &quot;Today,&quot; denied a suggestion that his recent $300,000 loan to House Speaker Newt Gingrich was designed to promote the political prospects of his wife, Elizabeth Dole.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don't think that's a matter of great interst to her right now,&quot; he said of a White House race for his wife, a two-time cabinet member who now heads the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>Pressed on whether she would run, Dole said: &quot;I don't know. I think we'll ... They're already taking polls, if you can believe it, on the race in 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked how Mrs Dole fared in such polls, Dole, the former Senate Republican leader, said: &quot;She does pretty well.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he had not discussed his loan to Gingrich with her beforehand &quot;and she was a little surprised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said, 'Well, you know, I think it's the right thing to do',&quot; he went on. Asked whether his wife had objected, he replied: &quot;Nope, it was my money.&quot;</p>
<p>Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, needed the funds to pay a $300,000 penalty for violating House of Representatives' ethics rules.</p>
<p>Dole, asked about the alleged &quot;sweetheart&quot; deal he gave Gingrich on the collateral-free, 10-percent interest loan that is payable in eight years, joked that Gingrich was now walking his dog, Leader, in exchange.</p>
<p>Asked whether Gingrich was doing a good job at this, Dole quipped: &quot;Not bad. Always brings him back.&quot;</p>
