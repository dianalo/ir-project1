<p>The new special prosecutor charged with investigating the March 1994 murder of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio said on Wednesday he would be forced to start the case over from the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to evaluate from the beginning all of the investigation into order to clear up these doubts,&quot; Luis Raul Gonzalez Perez told reporters.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, holding his first news conference since being named special prosecutor on Aug. 31, raised serious questions about the government investigation to this point.</p>
<p>He also kept open the possibility of interrogating former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who has since left the country in disgrace, about what he knows about the case.</p>
<p>The assassination remains largely a mystery two and a half years after the fact as three previous special prosecutors have come and gone, their prevailing theories left in tatters.</p>
<p>One man is in prison for the killing, serving a 45-year sentence, but authorities believe the assassination was a conspiracy involving several other people.</p>
<p>Gonzalez's predecessor was fired after an accused second gunman was acquitted by a judge for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Colosio, the candidate for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), almost certainly would have become president. His replacement as candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, won the August 1994 elections.</p>
<p>Gonzalez checked off a list of 26 doubts about the case that needed to be cleared up, including the number of gunmen, the existence of key witnesses who have not been interrogated, the murder of several police investigators and others related to the case, and why certain evidence was destroyed.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he has felt no political interference so far and that political figures from the past two governments would be called to testify.</p>
<p>&quot;We will call, of course, or don't rule out the possibility, all of these political actors, and we don't rule out the case of Mr. (Carlos) Salinas de Gortari,&quot; Gonzalez said.</p>
