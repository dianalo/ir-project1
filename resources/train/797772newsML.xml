<p>------------ CHART OUTLOOKS FOR STERLING ----------------</p>
<p>* Sterling parked in narrow ranges vs dollar and mark as base-building from last week's decline continues. Initial supports at round-figure and overnight low of $1.5800-1.5780 and psychological 2.93 and weekly low around 2.9270 marks.</p>
<p>* Below $1.5780, eyes on Tuesday low of $1.5730 then $1.57 before Friday bottom at $1.5660. Upside capped at $1.59 then strong barrier at week's resistance band in $1.5940 region.</p>
<p>* Stg/mark gains held to 2.95 then 2.96 congestion.</p>
<p>* At 0700 GMT, cable at $1.5838/49 vs $1.5770/80 and stg/mark at 2.9350/60 against 2.9399/04 marks.</p>
<p>The pound was keeping to fairly narrow ranges and looked set to continue this week's consolidation phase on the mark and dollar after last week's declines, said chartists.</p>
<p>Initial supports cut in around the 2.9340-50 marks area, congestive support today and Tuesday, before giving way to the round-figure 2.93 marks and this week's low at 2.9270.</p>
<p>Heavier support lies at Friday's low around 2.9140 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting down to quite a lot of support in the 2.91-2.90 area, if it goes lower there's not a huge amount to go for,&quot; said Anne Whitby, head of technical analysis at 4CAST.  </p>
<p>Whitby, speaking on Reuters Financial Television, saw sterling/mark getting down to this support in the short-term but good resistance nearby is then likely to see a volatile trading range develop for the time being.</p>
<p>On the upside, sterling/mark faces an initial test at 2.9450, its intra-day high, and then up to the round-figure 2.95, a band which stakes out a previous support and congestion zone from early July.</p>
<p>Above here, congestion at 2.96 marks level is a minor stumbling block before this week's highs in the 2.9665-75 marks area and then 2.97 marks.  </p>
<p>Cable was also consolidative though analysts said the outlook was slightly firmer. However, upside resistances are fairly heavy with the 1.5895-1.5900 marking the first cap.</p>
<p>As well as being a round-figure barrier, it also roughly coincides with a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the pound's drop from the 1.6250 area in the middle of last week to last Friday's 1.5560 low, said Dominique Corombelle, technical analyst at Generale Bank in Brussels.</p>
<p>Above here, the previous three days' highs around 1.5940 provide a stronger cap and then around 1.5960, a 50 percent retracement of last week's fall, said analysts.  </p>
<p>Above here, steep trendline resistance of cable's decline from late July cuts in around the round-figure 1.60 level, also a previous support point.</p>
<p>On the downside, Generale Bank's Corombelle sees good support at the 1.5775 area, just around the intra-day low. Below here, Tuesday's low of 1.5730 is expected to hold before the Friday low around 1.5660.</p>
