<p>Britain's Nuclear Electric has shut down one of its two reactors at its Heysham One plant after a fire on Tuesday but there was no danger of radiation, a company spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The reactor was closed down at 1038 GMT on Tuesday morning after the fire broke out, leading to a loss in production of 500 megawatts.</p>
<p>The blaze was put out less than 10 minutes later but the reactor remained shut pending an investigation into the cause of the fire, which spokesman Bon Fenton said was caused by an oil fire in the turbine. The reactor was expected to remain shut a further four days.</p>
<p>No-one was hurt in the fire at the plant near Morecambe, Lancashire, in northwest England.</p>
<p>&quot;The fire was put out by staff at 1045 GMT...we obviously need to look at what caused the fire. Reactor one is shut down,&quot; Fenton said.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil vapour caught fire, which in turn led to a small fire in the turbine bearings. There was no danger from the station itself,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The station, which supplies electricity to the national grid, has a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.</p>
