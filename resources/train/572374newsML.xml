<p>Midcontinent gasoline and low sulfur diesel differentials Friday firmed one cent as traders attempted to short cover amid the Explorer Pipeline's recent announcement of tightened rules for shipments from the Gulf Coast for the remaining three cycles of May.</p>
<p>Group Three conventional unleaded gasoline was offered at 4.25 cents over the June print, while Chicago material saw offers widen to 2.75 cents over -- widening one cent in both markets for the second day in a row..</p>
<p>The Explorer, which ships from Texas as far north as Indiana, usually allows clients to nominate deliveries for specific cycles -- with the option of later switching their reservation of line space to other cycles during the same month.</p>
<p>But it said Wednesday that transfer of line space between cycles will not be allowed for the remaining 13th, 14th and 15th ten-day cycles of May because the pipeline is running at capacity.  </p>
<p>Traders said players with commitments to deliver gasoline and low sulfur by early June are beginning to round up physical barrels early because the Explorer is five to 10 days behind schedule and is not expected to deliver 14th cycle barrels until after June 3.</p>
<p>On the distillate front, Group Three low sulfur diesel was offered at 6.0 cents over the June screen, while Chicago material firmed to 5.0 cents over, players said.</p>
