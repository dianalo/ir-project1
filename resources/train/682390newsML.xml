<p>Britain will suffer an explosion in cancer cases over the next 20 years, charity researchers predicted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>New cases of cancer will increase by 56 percent by 2018, while the number of people living with cancer will grow by 68 percent, the study, commissioned by Macmillan Cancer Relief, found.</p>
<p>&quot;About one in three people in this country are currently at risk of developing (cancer) at some time in their lives,&quot; the charity said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;By 2018 the risk will have worsened to about one in two.&quot; It said this included non-malignant skin cancers.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation has predicted that cancer cases will double around the world over the next 25 years -- even in the developing world. Much of this will be due to unhealthy habits such as smoking, high-fat diets and a sedentary lifestyle. &quot;The predictions are alarming, but we can do so much more for people living with cancers today than 20 years ago,&quot; Macmillan chief executive Nicholas Young said.</p>
<p>The study, by Dr Tom Davies and Diane Stockton of Cambridge University, predicted cases of prostate cancer would increase from 8.4 percent of men to 26.8 percent in 2018.</p>
<p>Breast cancer would rise from a nine percent prevalence to 13.7 percent.</p>
<p>Cancer has taken over from coronary heart disease as the biggest killer in England and Wales. Scientists say this is due in part to people living longer and surviving other diseases -- cancer becomes more likely as people get older.</p>
