<p>Shares in music publisher EMI Group Plc rose on Tuesday as recent sharp declines sparked a bout of bargain-hunting in the stock, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite a lot of buyers jumped in and squeezed up the market,&quot; said a market-maker at one leading brokerage. &quot;Everyone just came in trying to pick up cheap stock. It got overdone this morning.&quot; Said another: &quot;The bounce was due to a two-pound drop last week. Buyers are looking for value now. This is just a rally.&quot;</p>
<p>EMI shares, which earlier fell as low as 1083 stg -- their lowest in 18 months -- were up 29p at 11.30 stg by 1059 stg.  </p>
<p>&quot;At some stage there was always going to be a technical bounce in the shares,&quot; said another dealer. &quot;It wouldn't surprise me if we saw a rally back up to say 11.70 stg.&quot;</p>
<p>EMI shares have fallen sharply in the past two weeks, as long-standing worries over the state of the music market have been joined by negative comment from analysts at Schroder Securities.</p>
<p>Starting coverage of EMI with an &quot;underperform&quot; rating, Schroders said the stock should be sold down to 10.00 stg.</p>
