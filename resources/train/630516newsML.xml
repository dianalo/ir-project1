<p>Santander Investment said Monday it estimated Peru's April year-on-year economic growth was 13.7 percent, compared with 2.1 percent in April last year.</p>
<p>The strong growth prediction for April's gross domestic product (GDP) was based on healthy figures already published in some sectors and &quot;conversations with government sources&quot;, Santander said in a statement.</p>
<p>The government is set to announce the country's April GDP figure later this week.  </p>
<p>The investment arm of Spain's Banco Santander added its April GDP figure would mean year-on-year growth for the first four months was between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, compared with 0.7 percent in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Officials at the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI) provided the comparative figures for 1996 growth.</p>
<p>Analysts at Credibolsa -- the brokerage of Peru's largest commercial bank Banco de Credito -- had forecast April growth at 6.4 percent. But an analyst at the firm said the figure would be revised upward.  </p>
<p>The Peruvian economy grew 4.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, compared with a 0.6 percent year-on-year growth in the January to March period of 1996, according to the government's latest GDP figures.</p>
<p>GDP growth in March was 5.2 percent year over year, compared with a 0.9 percent contraction in March last year.</p>
