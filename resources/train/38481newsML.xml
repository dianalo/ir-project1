<p>A woman was killed and five people were injured in an explosion on Friday at a Portuguese school which local officials said appeared to have been caused by a bomb.</p>
<p>There were no children amongst the victims of the blast which occured at around 0815 GMT at a primary school in Fundao in central Portugal, 200 km (125 miles) northeast of Lisbon.</p>
<p>Fundao town councillor Jose Soares told local TSF radio that the explosion, which did extensive damage to the ground floor of the school, had been caused by an &quot;explosive device.&quot;</p>
<p>Police in Fundao could not immediately confirm that a bomb had caused the explosion but bomb squad officials were at the scene.</p>
<p>The dead woman, named as Ana Maria Nunes, 32, and the five people injured in the explosion all worked in the school, police said.</p>
<p>Three of the injured were in serious condition and were being treated in nearby hospitals. The other two people suffered only slight injuries.</p>
