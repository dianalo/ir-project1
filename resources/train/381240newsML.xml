<title>HONG KONG: Most Hong Kong legislators too busy for Rifkind.</title>
<headline>Most Hong Kong legislators too busy for Rifkind.</headline>

<p>Only eight of Hong Kongs 60 legislators made time for talks on Sunday with visiting British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.</p>
<p>In a palpable sign that British influence is waning fast as more than 150 years of colonial rule draws to a close, those who attended told reporters their colleagues had been unable to accomodate Rifkinds sudden change of schedule.</p>
<p>Even five years ago, such a meeting would have been packed to the rafters, legislators said.</p>
<p>Rifkind had originally planned to attend an open meeting on Monday afternoon with the Legislative Council but had to cut short his visit to return to London for a key parliamentary vote.</p>
<p>He is to leave Hong Kong on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The eight who attended represented a cross-section of Hong Kongs political spectrum.</p>
<p>The Democrats, who fear China will snuff out Hong Kongs freedoms and have criticised Britain for not doing enough to protect them, welcomed Rifkinds promise that Britain would continue to monitor events in Hong Kong beyound the handover at midnight on June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Bruce Liu, whose pro-democracy party broke ranks with other members of the pro-democracy camp to cooperate with China and sit on transitional bodies, described the British foreign minister as a &quot;broken record player&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Rifkind is like a broken record player, repeating the British governments position on the provisional legislature... that the British government opposes the provisional legislature...,&quot; Liu told reporters after the hour-long closed-door talks.</p>
<p>Both Liu and pro-business Liberal Party legislator Selina Chow said Britain should accept China will set up an interim legislature in place of the elected chamber like it or not and urged Britain to cooperate.</p>
<p>Britain argues there is no need to dismantle the existing body and offers no assistance to the chamber-in-waiting which was formed in December to undo the democratic reforms spearheaded by Governor Chris Patten in the dying days of British rule. The Democrats have boycotted the provisional legislature.</p>
