<headline>Proposed fish vessel ban unfair, US shipowner says.</headline>

<p>A proposed moratorium that would prevent large fishing vessels from harvesting mackerel and herring along the U.S. Atlantic Coast is unfair and unwarranted, the general manager of the boat most immediately affected by the proposal told House lawmakers Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;To exclude us now is simply not fair,&quot; Michael Love told the House Resources subcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans. Love is a principal in American Pelagic Fishing Co L.P., which owns the Atlantic Star, a vessel capable of harvesting 50,000 tonnes of fish annually when it becomes operational later this year.</p>
<p>The ship's huge capacity -- which is least double the current Atlantic mackerel catch -- has raised concerns that &quot;factory vessels&quot; could deplete fish stocks along the New England coast and drive smaller fishing boats out of business.</p>
<p>To prevent that from happening, a group of New England congressmen earlier this month introduced legislation that would prohibit large fishing vessels from harvesting Atlantic herring and mackeral in U.S. waters until:</p>
<p>--the National Marine Fisheries Services completes a new population survey of the two species; and</p>
<p>--the Commerce Department approves and implements a fishery management plan allowing the participation of large vessels.</p>
<p>Overfishing, mainly by foreign vessels, has threatened both the Atlantic mackerel and herring in the past.</p>
<p>But stocks of both currently are in &quot;healthy&quot; supply, &quot;with some potential&quot; for increased harvest, Rolland Schmitten, assitant administrator of the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service told the panel.</p>
<p>NMFS estimates the &quot;spawning stock biomass&quot; for both species at more than 2 million tonnes, enough to sustain an annual herring catch of 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes and an annual mackerel harvest of &quot;several hundred-thousand tonnes,&quot; said Andrew Rosenberg, NMFS Northeast Regional Administrator.</p>
<p>Under questioning from Committee Chairman Jim Saxton, a New Jersey Republican and co-sponsor of the proposed moratorium, Schmitten acknowledged that both species could be threatened again without prudent management.</p>
<p>&quot;A lack of timely action has brought the decline of many stocks&quot; in the past, he said.</p>
<p>But Schmitten also noted that NFMS could intervene in as little as 1 day if overfishing threatened either species.    &quot;We will not let these</p>
<p>fish become overfished,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>American Pelagic Fishing's made its decision to invest $40 million in the Atlantic Star based on &quot;every known fishery law and policy, from the federal level to the regional fishery management councils,&quot; Love said.</p>
<p>The ship length and horsepower restrictions in the proposed moratorium were &quot;never suggested in the regulatory process&quot; and were introduced in legislation &quot;long after our vessel was purchased and put in the shipyard,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Also, current Atlantic &quot;herring and mackeral stocks are abundant, healthy and will easily support the additional capacity of our vessel,&quot; Love said.</p>
<p>But Brad Gilman, a representative for Seafreeze Ltd., which catches and processes mackerel, said allowing ships such as the Atlantic Star could dramatically change the stock situation.</p>
<p>&quot;We could quickly go from an underutilized fishery to an overutilized fishery,&quot; Gilman said. &quot;All we need is three boats&quot; of the Atlantic Star's size.</p>
<p>A representative from Greenpeace, a leading environmental group, also testified in favor of the moratorium, which she said would &quot;go a long way&quot; toward preventing overfishing of the Altantic mackerel and herring.</p>
