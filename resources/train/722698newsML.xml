<title>NETHERLANDS: Airlines slam night curbs at Amsterdam's Schiphol.</title>
<headline>Airlines slam night curbs at Amsterdam's Schiphol.</headline>

<p>Airlines operating out of Schiphol unanimously condemned tough new restrictions on night flights unveiled by Amsterdam's airport on Friday as &quot;wholly unacceptable&quot;.</p>
<p>The curbs, aimed at keeping noise levels within legally determined limits, will ban night-time take-offs of most wide-body aircraft -- such as DC10s and Boeing 747 100s,200s and 300s and the Boeing 747SP -- from August 1.</p>
<p>The night ban -- from 2300 through 0600 hours -- will also apply to all flights running into delays which reach beyond the 2300 watershed, while unscheduled landings during night hours will be subject to penalty fines.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no alternative if we are to remain within the legally defined noise limits,&quot; Schiphol president Hans Smits told a news conference to announce the measures.</p>
<p>The restrictions will particularly affect cargo carriers operating through Schiphol and, to a lesser extent, charter airlines, Smits said.</p>
<p>As a result Schiphol -- which handled some 1.3 million tonnes of goods in 1996 and boasted Europe's biggest annual cargo growth in May -- is expected to lose some 30,000 tonnes of cargo this year, rising to 50-100,000 tonnes in 1998.</p>
<p>Thousands of jobs in the cargo industry could go, Smits added.</p>
<p>But he said, &quot;If we don't impose these restrictions now, the whole airport would have to be shut overnight from around September.&quot;</p>
<p>However, a spokesman for Dutch carrier KLM condemned the measures as &quot;overkill&quot;, saying the curbs were &quot;both operationally and commercially unacceptable.&quot;</p>
<p>As the proposals now stand, KLM would be forced to deploy alternative aircraft for three weekly cargo flights currently operated with low-noise so-called chapter three Boeing aircraft from U.S carrier Atlas Air, spokesman Peter Offerman said.</p>
<p>But KLM was more worried about the blanket ban on unscheduled night departures given the many flights it operated out of Schiphol just prior to the watershed, Offerman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We operate a lot of flights between 10 and 11 pm using MD-11s and 747-400s. According to the letter of the Schiphol proposal, we would not be allowed to take off in the event of a limited delay,&quot; he said. &quot;The measures are far too rigid.&quot;</p>
<p>He said KLM will submit a counter-proposal to the traffic ministry seeking an exemption for chapter three aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe a ban which excludes chapter three aircraft will enable Schiphol to keep within the statutory noise threshold,&quot; Offerman said.</p>
<p>Israel's El Al and privately-owned Polar Air will also be badly hit by the measures, as will Martinair, KLM's 50-50 freight and passenger joint venture with Rotterdam's Nedlloyd.</p>
<p>El Al is now mulling the transfer of its cargo hub to Belgium's Liege airport, and Martinair has criticised the proposed measures as discriminatory and unfair.</p>
<p>&quot;The three Boeing 747 aircraft operated by Martinair are so-called chapter three aircraft...of the most low-noise,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Excluding Martinair chapter three aircraft while allowing aircraft from other airlines which fall into the same category is unreasonable and, in Martinair's view, unacceptable,&quot; the airline said.</p>
<p>Martinair said its night-time flight movements had remained constant over the last three years and as such it had not contributed to the capacity bottleneck.</p>
<p>But Smits said Schiphol's failure to agree a voluntary 50 percent reduction in night-time take-offs with the airlines concerned meant it had been forced to impose a unilateral ban which affected the culpable and non-culpable alike.</p>
<p>Some 70 percent of Schiphol's annual quota of night flights had already been used up, Smits said.</p>
<p>This was due mainly to greater-than-envisaged deployment of noisy wide-body aircraft and the use of Hercules craft for charter and freight, he said.</p>
<p>He said Schiphol had requested urgent talks with transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma in a bid to resolve the problem of noise restrictions which will effectively limit further airport growth to &quot;a few percent&quot; over the coming years.</p>
