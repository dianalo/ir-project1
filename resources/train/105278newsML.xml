<text>
<p>Singapore material handling company Inter-Roller Engineering Ltd said on Wednesday it was proposing a one-for-two bonus issue of shares and a one-for-two renounceable rights issue.  </p>
<p>Inter-Roller said in a statement both issues would involve the creation of a minimum of 17.04 million and a maximum of 20.73 million new shares in the company.</p>
<p>DBS Bank had been appointed to manage and underwrite the proposed rights issue. The Stock Exchange of Singapore had approved, in principle, an application for both issues, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bonus issue is to reward shareholders in view of the good performance of the group for the financial year ended December 31, 1995, and for the half year ended June 30, 1996,&quot; the statement said.  </p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the bonus issue will serve to increase the capital base of the company in line with with group's plans for continuing growth and expansion. The rights issue is expected to raise net proceeds of between Singapore $5.7 million and S$7.0 million,&quot; the Inter-Roller statement said.</p>
<p>Of the total raised by the rights issue, approximately S$3.4 million would finance construction of a factory for its Malaysian subsidiary IR Engineering Sdn Bhd and S$1.8 million would be used to acquire machinery and equipment, it said.</p>
<p>The balance proceeds of S$0.5-S$1.8 million would be used to meet the group's general capital requirements.  </p>
