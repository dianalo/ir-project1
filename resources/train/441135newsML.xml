<p>Norwegian shares edged down on Thursday following losses on Wall Street, but analysts expected the Oslo Total index to rise overall in 1997.</p>
<p>Nine Oslo-based analysts polled by Reuters forecast the Norwegian stock market would keep rising in 1997 despite rallying for most of the time so far this year.</p>
<p>The analysts suggested on the average the Total Index would hit 1,165 points at the end of 1997. The maximum forecast was 1,275 and the minimum was 990.</p>
<p>The index, which soared to an all-time closing high of 1,128.46 on February 20, closed 0.19 percent off at 1,101.33 points on Thursday. Turnover was a healthy one billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;We have forecast the index to rise 22 percent this year, but most of this increase has already been achieved. We are already up 14 percent, so we can expect another seven-eight percent,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>A broker commented: &quot;I think the market will be calming down in the near future now that we have the company annual results to mull over.&quot;</p>
