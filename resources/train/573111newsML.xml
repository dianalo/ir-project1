<title>USA: Transitional to discuss merger with Vencor.</title>
<headline>Transitional to discuss merger with Vencor.</headline>

<p>Transitional Hospitals Corp., after agreeing to a buyout by Select Medical Corp., said Friday it would begin merger talks with Vencor Inc. which is offering a higher bid of $639 million in cash.</p>
<p>Vencor, a diversified provider of health care services, offered $16 a share on Wednesday, days after Transitional said it had a definitive agreement to be acquired by Select for $14.55 a share, or $564.5 million.</p>
<p>Transitional said the deal with Select, based in Mechanicsburg, Pa., allows it to enter into discussions with unsolicited bidders.</p>
<p>Transitional Chairman Richard Conte said the action was consistent with the Las Vegas-based company's commitment to maximizing shareholder value.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that Vencor is likely to emerge as winner in the bidding war because it has the deepest pockets.</p>
<p>The combination of Vencor and Transitional, which operates long-term acute care hospitals, would advance the growth strategy of Vencor, the nation's largest full-service long-term health care provider.</p>
<p>The combined company would have 57 hospitals, 314 skilled nursing centres, 4,000 institutional customers for contract rehabilitation services, 80,000 employees and pro forma annual revenues of $3.3 billion. Vencor, based in Louisville, Ky., said it would retain all of Transitional's non-administrative employees, but did not say how many people might be laid off.</p>
<p>The Vencor offer is scheduled to expire June 4, and is subject to the tender of at least two-thirds of Transitional's fully diluted common shares and equivalents. The offer has no financing contingency.</p>
<p>Vencor's stock rose 12.5 cents to $37.75, while Transitional was unchanged at $15.50 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.</p>
