<p>Martin Lee, a leading Hong Kong democracy leader, said on Tuesday that the West was morally obliged to tell China it was curbing freedoms in Hong Kong in contravention of its 1984 agreement with Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;It becomes the moral obligation of every government that supported the joint declaration at least to ensure that China will adhere to her promises made in 1984 and keep Hong Kong free,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Lee, an elected legislator who heads the Democratic Party, is making his case to senior U.N. officials, before seeing U.S. President Bill Clinton later this week. Hong Kong reverts to Beijing's control on July 1.</p>
<p>He argued that the Untied States and many other countries had responded favorably to the 1984 Sino-British accord, setting out conditions and timetables for the transfer.</p>
<p>&quot;All these governments came out with such warm responses because they were asked by both the British government and the Chinese governments to support the agreement so as to allay fears of the Hong Kong people and encourage investors to remain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It becomes not just an internal affair of China but it becomes the business of other governments,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;to sit back and do nothing is actually encouraging China to break even more agreements with other countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All that we are doing is to hold China to her own agreement with Britain registered with the United Nations.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1984 delcaration, under which Britain agreed to turn over Hong Kong to the Chinese after 140 years of rule, included giving the colony freedoms under a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy for 50 years, including its current social and economic systems and general political and civil rights.</p>
<p>But China has already appointed a &quot;provisional legislature&quot; for Hong Kong to replace the body elected in 1995 under British political reforms. This group intends to strike down laws on freedom of assembly and other civil liberties as well as the role of an independent judiciary.</p>
<p>Lee also repeated  his support for the Most Favored Nation trade status for China and said any reversal would hurt Hong Kong more than China. But he said he realized 1997 would be a difficult year for renewal, with increasing numbers of U.S. legislators linking MFN status to human rights.</p>
<p>Both Lee and his legislative colleague, Andrew Cheng, admitted the business community was not eager to have governments protest China's broken promises on Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But he said this was short-sighted because business leaders needed reliable information on developments in China and so far most of it came from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>China had the &quot;unhappy habit&quot; of exaggerating the good news and downplaying the bad news. &quot;If the light will be switched off in Hong Kong the darkness falls on the whole of China,&quot; he said.</p>
