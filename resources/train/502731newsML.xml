<p>U.S. long-term interest rates bumped up against a recent high-water mark on Friday and may float higher as the fixed-income market slogs through a torrent of economic data next week, analysts said.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond's yield nudged the 7.19 percent level Friday, a reading that would have matched its highest close since July 8, 1996.</p>
<p>Inflation jitters and concern over Federal Reserve monetary policy drove selling in the past week and should dominate market psychology in coming days, experts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;All of the recent data has shown uniform strength,&quot; said Dan Seto, senior economist at Nikko Securities Co International Inc. &quot;More of the same will happen next week.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists offered mixed views of what will be the key report of the coming week, differing over whether the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would hold much sway in the market.</p>
<p>March consumer prices, set for release Tuesday at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT, were expected up 0.2 percent overall and up 0.3 percent for the less-volatile core components -- those excluding food and evergy -- according to a Reuters poll.  </p>
<p>A figure on par with the consensus would affect the market little, but any further increase in the core CPI could hurt bonds, some experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you got a number like 0.4 percent on the core ... people are going to start getting concerned,&quot; said John Ryding, managing director and senior economist at Bear Stearns &amp; Co Inc.</p>
<p>The Producer Price Index (PPI) prompted a bond-market selloff Friday when it showed a 0.4 percent gain in its core component, even though the overall index declined 0.1 percent.  </p>
<p>Surges in aircraft and tobacco prices largely propelled the jump in core PPI.</p>
<p>Some experts said special factors, such as higher airfares, might explain away a similar CPI performance, but most agreed the market would react negatively to anything not clearly a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>&quot;It's likely to trade pretty defensively if we get that kind of number and it seems to be broadly based,&quot; said Richard Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.  </p>
<p>Other key data during the week was expected to be bearish, as well. In particular, Wednesday's Federal Reserve release was forecast to show strong gains in industrial output and capacity utilization.</p>
<p>Production was estimated up 0.6 percent in March after a 0.5 percent rise in February, and the capacity measure was seen at 83.6 percent, up from 83.3 percent.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's business outlook survey, scheduled for Thursday, provides a first glimpse of April data. Economists forecast it would decline to 20.4 from 21.1 in March.  </p>
<p>The Philly Fed's prices paid index was expected to garner particular attention because it rose to 13.3 in March from 6.3 in February.</p>
<p>Housing starts, set for Wednesday, should get a look, too. They were projected at a 1.46 million-unit annual rate in March against a 1.528 million-unit rate in February.</p>
<p>Bracing for strong data, several analysts said the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond's yield  might easily pierce 7.2 percent and head toward 7.25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think 7.25 percent is probably a key psychological level for the bond,&quot; Mellon's Berner said.</p>
