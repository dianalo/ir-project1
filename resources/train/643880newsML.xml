<p>The Bank of England's decision on Friday to raise interest rates at the first opportunity since winning independence fuelled speculation that a string of quarter point rises this year is likely, unless the government breaks with election pledges and delivers big tax rises in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank is putting monetary policy firmly in the driving seat and rates are going to come in rather higher than financial markets currently think,&quot; said Ian Stewart, UK economist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>The Bank of England raised UK interest rates by 0.25 percent to 6.5 percent on Friday.  </p>
<p>UK interest rate futures are pricing in only modest further rate rises this year. The December short sterling contract, down three basis points on the day at 92.98, is implying base rates at just 6.75 percent by the year-end.</p>
<p>The strip expects rates to peak at 7.25 percent which Stewart believes is too modest. &quot;I think 7.5 percent is a more likely outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>However, much depends on the contents of Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's first budget on July 2.</p>
<p>The prevailing City view that the new government will tighten fiscal policy to dampen demand is being challenged by a growing number of economists. They say it is constrained by election pledges, and lacks a good enough economic reason to break with them.</p>
<p>Labour's promised to stick to existing strict departmental spending plans for the next two years, ruling out fresh spending cuts, while the opportunity for tax rises are limited by the party's pledge not to raise income tax rates or broaden the range of goods subject to value-added tax (VAT).  </p>
<p>&quot;It largely depends on the budget now with the level of fiscal tightening key,&quot; said Andrew Snowball, UK economist at the Cooperative Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The more we get there, the less rates will need to go up. But if there is little or no tighening -- which some people are starting to think -- rates will clearly have to go much higher.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the rate rise has helped the committee establish some credibility. &quot;There were some fears that since all the Bank had done until now was advise, it may have been timid about acting once it got power. That clearly is not the case.&quot;  </p>
<p>But the rate rise did not win approval from all quarters.</p>
<p>The Confederation of British Industry said it was rather disappointed by the rise and manufacturers would suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;The central policy dilemma simply isn't going to go away,&quot; chief economist Kate Barker told the BBC.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer spending is likely to be pretty strong...but exports are likely to continue to have a very tough time. We hope therefore that further rate rises can be kept to a minimum.&quot;</p>
<p>And a number of City economists were far from enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Nikko Securities said Friday's rate rise suggested there would be more to come, which would damage the economic recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher interest rates will damage the economy in all sorts of sectors. Manufacturing is the obvious one, but the regions (outside the South East of England) will also suffer.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the economic &quot;boomlet' -- combining very strong consumer spending and spiralling house prices --  was highly localised and confined to London and surrounding counties. &quot;Elsewhere, this is not the case and in some areas house prices are falling. The last thing they need is higher mortgage rates.</p>
