<headline>Australia says no complaints from India on wheat.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) has abided by all requirements in its big sales of wheat to India this year and has not received official complaints about quality problems, an AWB official told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>Tim Dewan, AWB regional marketing manager Southeast Asia, which includes India, said he was aware of concern by Indian authorities over weed seeds in Australian shipments to India.</p>
<p>Australia, which has export contracts with India to a total of 2.325 million tonnes for 1997 sales, has so far shipped 1.3 million, has another shipment of 1.0 million scheduled for July and the balance scheduled for November/December shipment.  </p>
<p>&quot;As far as we're concerned we've sold a million tonnes to them (on the) same contract specifications as what we've already shipped, there's been no problem at all,&quot; Dewan said.</p>
<p>The AWB had had discussions with Indian officials and wheat buyers, who were advising on a course of action, he said.</p>
<p>It was assessing whether the current controversy was a &quot;storm in a teacup&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We've met every requirement they've put on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There had been no change in supply specifications from five years ago, when AWB last shipped to the Indian market, he said.  </p>
<p>It would be a concern to the AWB if it could not access the Indian market in future, but the AWB believed that whatever applied to it would apply to other suppliers as well, he said.</p>
<p>Dewan was commenting to Reuters on reports from India that authorities were moving to ensure that wheat imports were free of seed weeds after some were found in shipments from Australia.</p>
<p>According to reports from New Delhi, the Indian Food Ministry will now require an additional declaration on the phytosanitary certificate assuring that wheat consignments were free of exotic weeds which could take root in India's wheat-growing areas, primarily in the north.  </p>
<p>Press Trust of India said Indian authorities would consider &quot;viable alternatives&quot; if difficulties were encountered in the implementation of weed-free requirements.</p>
<p>Australian wheat posed no threat to human health and was among the highest quality in the world, an AWB spokesman said.</p>
