<headline>Sentiment-driven Brussels bourse seen moving up.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Brussels bourse ended a varied Thursday with light gains as buoyant sentiment overcame nerves, and traders said no end was in sight to the rally that has lifted the Bel-20 index 20 percent this year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is good buying support in the market, although volume was quite low today,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 blue chip share index ended with a gain of 3.60 points or 0.16 percent at 2,251.30 in a 2,257.45/2,243.94 range, with a thin 2.5 billion francs of Belgian shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Traders said there was no specific feature to the market, with individual shares rather than sectors winning attention.</p>
<p>Steel cord and wire maker Bekaert bounced back 1.4 percent to 21,100 francs after being pushed lower in recent weeks by a &quot;reduce&quot; recommendation from broker Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Film finisher Spector also rose strongly after positive comments from Wednesday's annual meeting. The share rose 3.2 percent to 2,430 francs.</p>
<p>Non-ferrous metals group Union Miniere held up well, rising 0.2 percent to 2,935 francs despite some worries that its exchange offer for the rest of its 54 percent owned diamond unit Sibeka could release a flood of shares onto the market and pressure prices.</p>
<p>Traders said GBL and Kredietbank both suffered light profit-taking losses, dropping 1.0 percent and 0.5 percent respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of speculation about those companies, so they will regularly rise and fall until we hear something concrete,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said the only sector to have been targeted was insurers, again through speculation of company changes.</p>
