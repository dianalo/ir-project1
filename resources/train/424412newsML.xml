<title>USA: Thrift industry earned $4.8 billion last year.</title>
<headline>Thrift industry earned $4.8 billion last year.</headline>

<p>Thanks to low interest rates and a strong economy, federally regulated savings and loans earned $4.8 billion in 1996, the Office of Thrift Supervision said Thursday.</p>
<p>That was the fourth-highest annual earnings total but down from 1995's record of $5.4 billion, the OTS said.</p>
<p>Thrifts actually earned a record $6.9 billion for the year but also had to pay one-time special assessments to recapitalize their insurance fund, the OTS said.</p>
<p>Savings and loans had total assets of $769 billion at year-end, with just $9 billion of &quot;troubled assets,&quot; the lowest since 1990.</p>
<p>Troubled assets included noncurrent loans and repossessed assets. The 1996 total was down about 5 percent from the year-end 1995 total of $9.5 billion.</p>
<p>The strong results should be viewed against a background of the strong economy and low interest rates, OTS director Nicholas Retsinas said at a press briefing here.</p>
<p>Thrifts boosted earnings during the year by diversifying their sources of fee income, selling more mutual funds and annuities for example, while seeing their interest expenses drop, Kenneth Ryder, OTS executive director of research and analysis, said.</p>
<p>The number of problem thrifts, those rated in the lowest two categories by bank examiners, continued to drop in 1996. Just 29 thrifts with total assets of $5 billion were in trouble, compared with 41 thrifts with $11 billion of assets at the end of 1995 and 450 thrifts with $235 billion of assets back in 1990, OTS said.</p>
<p>The bulk of thrift lending activity remained concentrated in the housing sector, although loans to small business have been growing strongly from a small initial base, the OTS said.</p>
<p>The $769 billion of total assets included $384 billion of family mortgage loans, $49 billion of multifamily mortgages, and $18 billion of construction loans. About $40 billion was consumer loans and just over $9 billion was small business and commercial loans.</p>
<p>Thrifts also held $199 billion of mortgage pool and investment securities.</p>
