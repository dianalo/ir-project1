<headline>CRICKET-RUSSELL MAY FACE DISCIPLINARY ACTION OVER BOOK.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>England wicketkeeper Jack Russell faces the prospect of disciplinary action from the country's cricket authorities over a chapter in his forthcoming autobiography.</p>
<p>The book to be published next month is believed to include a controversial section on England captain Mike Atherton and former chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth.</p>
<p>Under the terms of their contract, players should have items for publication approved by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).</p>
<p>The ECB want Gloucestershire's Russell to have another look at the chapter, and its administration secretary Tony Brown said: &quot;He knows perfectly well what the rules are with regard to a book by a player.&quot;</p>
<p>Russell's agent, Jim Ruston, said: &quot;The whole thing is very tame compared with some of the books you can buy today and the ECB is very sensitive. They are a law unto themselves.&quot;</p>
