<p>Malaysian rubber prices ended higher with a firmer close in Tokyo and some pre-holiday covering helping sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a quiet day but there were some covering interest,&quot; a dealer said, adding that trading activity remained limited because most buyers have already completed their buying program for the year.</p>
<p>There were a few Far East and European consumers who were just checking on prices, traders said. Business was mainly routine and on hand-to-mouth basis.  </p>
<p>At the close, MRELB said January RSS Ones buyer ended unchanged at 315.50 cents ($1.25) a kg and January SMR 20 buyer was up one cent at 304.50 cents a kg.</p>
<p>Dealers offered SMR CV at 362 cents for January, SMR L at 342 cents, SMR 10 at 305 and drum latex at 234-236.</p>
<p>The INRO five-day moving average was 241.20 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Dec 6 from 241.56 on Dec 5. The daily indicator price was 240.15 against 240.98.</p>
