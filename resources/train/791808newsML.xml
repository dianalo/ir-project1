<p>Five weeks before Norwegians go to  the ballot box a new opinion poll on Monday showed slightly higher support for the ruling Labour Party, but more voters than ever undecided.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out by one of six major pollsters in  the country, Norsk Gallup, and shown on TV2 television, gave Labour 28.7 percent, a rise of 1.2 percent from a similar poll at the end of July.</p>
<p>Labour polled almost 37 percent in the last election in 1993.</p>
<p>However, after a week of full election campaigning, 39.4  percent of the sample said they were still undecided how they would vote on September 15 compared with 38.5 percent in the last poll.</p>
<p>The right-wing populist Progress Party extended its support  0.7 percent to 22.7 percent.</p>
<p>Parliament's three-party centrist bloc, seen as the main  election threat to Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland's government, dropped back to a total 23.9 percent, down from 24.2 percent in July.</p>
<p>Of the centrist bloc, only liberal Venstre advanced in the  latest survey, up 0.1 percent to 5.7 percent, while support for the Christian People's Party and the Centre Party slipped 1.2 percent and 0.4 percent to 8.8 percent and 8.6 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The Conservatives advanced 1.6 percent to 15.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The main point is that if we are going to take  responsibility (after the election) we have to get off this 16-17 percent level as shown in this poll and we must go forward,&quot; Conservative leader Jan Petersen told TV2.</p>
<p>The poll, taken between August 6 and August 10, questioned  a sample of 1,161 voters, slightly larger than the 950 voters in the July survey.</p>
<p>Political scientists had questioned the validity of the July poll owing to many voters being on summer holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;I take this opinion poll seriously,&quot; Frank Aarebrot, a political scientist at the University of Bergen, told the NTB news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Two independent polls have now shown the same tendency and therefore the results are to be trusted.&quot;</p>
<p>The Labour Party, which is the biggest of the eight parties  in the 165-seat Storing, or parliament, has been in power since 1990.</p>
