<p>Hong Kong's stock market went for a rollercoaster ride on Thursday, the first day of trading since the capitalist enclave was returned to China.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index, which had closed at a record high last week as the curtain fell on British rule, leaped by more than one percent to 15,363.61 points at the start of trading.</p>
<p>But then the index promptly succumbed to profit-taking and dipped back down again amid fears over government plans to increase housing supply in one of the world's most overcrowded cities. Property stocks led the market down.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, shaking off its party hangover after five days of non-stop celebrations, was back doing what it does best -- making money and lots of it.</p>
<p>With financiers around the world watching closely to see how Hong Kong would fare under China's &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula for reunification, new leader Tung Chee-hwa had plenty to celebrate.</p>
<p>And he hammered home the message to Hong Kong's top executives at a big dinner on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;We are finally masters of our own destiny,&quot; he told them. &quot;Our goal is clear: we must make Hong Kong more successful than before,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tung, a shipping magnate hand-picked by Beijing to steer Hong Kong through uncertain waters, was eager to reassure any nervous investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central Government (Beijing) have given us a free hand in dealing with our internal affairs and have demonstrated flexibility, understanding, cooperation and accommodation.&quot;</p>
<p>Hong Kong's economy has risen by almost six percent a year over the past decade and a bullish Tung warned the naysayers: &quot;No one has ever betted against Hong Kong in the past and won.&quot;</p>
<p>The sunny outlook for the economy was certainly not matched by the weather. One person was feared dead and eight were injured in landslides caused by days of torrential rain.</p>
<p>All schools were closed across Hong Kong, roads were blocked and weather forecasters warned there were more storms to come.</p>
<p>The caretaker at a Buddhist monastery was feared dead after an avalanche of mud and rocks enveloped her house, police said.</p>
<p>Eight people were rescued after being buried under tonnes of mud while trying to clear an earlier landslide.</p>
<p>Superintendent Lee Chiu-Keung, who suffered a broken leg, said from his hospital bed: &quot;My eyes, my ears and my nose were all filled with mud and I felt my right leg go. But I told myself to stay calm.&quot;</p>
<p>Chris Patten, Britain's 28th and final governor who left early on Tuesday after a tearful and emotional farewell, could be back within a year.</p>
<p>Media reports said Patten, already given a hefty advance for the book he is now writing, could front a major television series on Asia.</p>
<p>Patten's agent, Michael Sissons, told the South China Morning Post he was optimistic the series would go ahead.</p>
<p>Asked if that meant Patten returning to Hong Kong, Sissons said: &quot;Absolutely, you bet.&quot;</p>
