<p>Colombian stocks ended mixed in active trade, fueled by continuing speculation about an announced alliance between Spain's Banco Central Hispano (BCH) and Banco de Colombia.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index edged up a wafer-thin 0.05 percent to close at 13,637.07 on an active trading volume of 1.7 billion pesos. Bogota's IBB fell 0.59 percent, however, ending the week at 878.28 on a volume of 1.08 billion pesos.  </p>
<p>The day's biggest loser in Bogota was Banco de Colombia, which had climbed 10.57 percent Thursday before trading was suspended following news that BCH plans to buy up to 36 percent of the bank.</p>
<p>The bank, Colombia's second largest in terms of assets, fell 2.17 percent on Friday to 450 pesos per share on profit-taking and what brokers described as uncertainty prompted by a lack of follow-up news on its future partnership with BCH.  </p>
<p>Other heavily-traded losers in Bogota included brewer Bavaria S.A., which fell 0.85 percent to 4,065 pesos and Banco Industrial Colombiano (BIC), which slipped 0.28 percent to 3,500.</p>
<p>Cadenalco, Colombia's largest retailer, also ended lower, dropping 0.33 percent to 913 pesos per share.</p>
<p>Banco de Bogota was among the day's few winners in Bogota, rising 0.23 percent to close at 6,125 pesos ahead of its third quarter results, due to be reported next week.</p>
<p>Cement manufacturer Cementos Argos was among the most heavily traded issues in Medellin, but it closed unchanged at 5,400 pesos per share. Retailer Almancenes Exito led the day's losers in Medellin, dropping 3.5 percent to close at 2,700 pesos per share.</p>
