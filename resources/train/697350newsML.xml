<p>Sulzer AG said it had no plans to reduce its 75 percent stake in medical technology unit Sulzer Medica after the subsidiary goes public.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no plans today to give up more (shares),&quot;  Sulzer chief executive Fritz Fahrni told a news conference on Sulzer Medica, whose shares are due to start trading the week of July 14.</p>
<p>Sulzer is offering one quarter of its stake in Sulzer Medica to the public, or about 2.3 million shares to be listed on the Swiss Exchange and as American depositary shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Sulzer confirmed it was targeting an issue price for Medica at between 300 Swiss francs and 350 Swiss francs ($206-241) per registered share despite higher grey market prices.</p>
<p>Sulzer Medica chief executive Abdre Buchel told the news conference that the price, which is being determined now in bookbuilding, could be at the top of the range or even 350.</p>
<p>Investment banker Markus Metygas from global coordinator Morgan Stanley told reporters the issue price could in theory be higher than the target but added: &quot;This is not planned at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Sulzer Medica posted sales of 1.16 billion Swiss francs in 1996 and employed 4,557 people.</p>
<p>It designs, manufactures and markets a range of implantable orthopaedic and cardiovascular products. Orthopaedic products accounted for 52 percent and cardiovascular products for 48 percent of 1996 sales. Europe made up 47 percent of sales and North America 40 percent.</p>
