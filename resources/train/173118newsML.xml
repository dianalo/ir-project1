<p>Connecticut, which plans to sell almost $162 million of bonds during the week of November 11, has yet to include $6 million of school bonds on the State Bond Commission's agenda, the Hartford Courant said Tuesday.</p>
<p>State school officials said the education department has been asking since August for the issue to be placed on the bond commission's agenda.</p>
<p>The state Deparment of Education this summer awarded 45 schools systems money to wire their classrooms for computers, the paper said.</p>
<p>Gov. John Rowland is under pressure to keep under this year's bonding cap of $500 million, the paper said. The paper quoted a spokeswoman for the governor as saying no decision had been made yet for the commission's December meeting. She added Rowland was &quot;very supportive&quot; of the computer program for schools.</p>
