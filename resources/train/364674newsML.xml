<p>Anthropologists and archaeologists believe they have unearthed signs of the first New Zealand settlement by Europeans more than 200 years ago, Television New Zealand reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The discovery was made at Luncheon Cove in Fiordland National Park in the southern tip of the South Island.</p>
<p>Otago University anthropologist Ian Smith said a group of 10 seal hunters were left on the site in November 1792 and built a small house and a ship.</p>
<p>The sealers were there for 10 months and culled thousands of fur seals. Smith said they found a pit which was part of a forge to steam planks into shape for the ship.</p>
<p>Thirty metres (yards) away a piece of metal was found which Smith believes could be part of the oldest house in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He said a second phase of the discovery expedition would begin 10 km (six miles) north of Luncheon Cove at Facile Harbour, site of a seal-hunting settlement of 242 men and two women.</p>
<p>English explorer Captain James Cook had first charted the coast of New Zealand in 1769 but New Zealand was settled hundreds of years before the Europeans arrived by Polynesian Maoris.</p>
