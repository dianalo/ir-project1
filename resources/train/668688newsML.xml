<p>Aluminium prices are expected to remain stable because the market is balanced, Bernard Legrand, Chairman of the European Aluminium Association, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the association's annual news conference, Legrand said that after major destocking last autumn prices were forecast to stay around $1,600 a tonne with spare capacity being restarted to meet increased demand.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no reason why they should depart from this figure,&quot; Legrand, who is also head of Pechiney's aluminium division, said in response to a question.</p>
<p>But he cautioned that the situation could change suddenly as the aluminium price on the London Metal Exchange was influenced by prices of other metals and currency factors.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the LME price was around $1,586 a tonne.</p>
<p>Legrand said that the EAA's expectations of four percent growth in Western World aluminium demand should be treated cautiously as it was unclear how much this was due to restocking and how much to economic growth.</p>
<p>Legrand said it was also difficult to forecast Western World aluminium production in 1997 because there was one million tonnes of idle capacity which could be brought onstream.</p>
<p>He noted there had been no recent announcements on restarting capacity, one of the last being 20,000 tonnes reactivated by Hydro Aluminium at the start of 1997.</p>
<p>But Legrand said he expected new operations of about 300,000 tonnes to start up by the end of 1997 and a similar tonnage in 1998. &quot;It depends on the market situation,&quot; he said. --Peter Blackburn Brussels Bureay +322 287 630</p>
