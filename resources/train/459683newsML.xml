<p>Two of Germany's oldest industry groups, Thyssen and Krupp, won support from Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt Friday to merge their steel operations amid speculation Krupp has secured a sizable stake in its rival.</p>
<p>Speaking at a coal industry conference in Gelsenkirchen, Rexrodt said a merger of the steel operations of Thyssen and Hoesch-Krupp, which have an annual turnover of some 63 billion marks ($37 billion), was inevitable and would be good for the industry.</p>
<p>He said talks that opened this week on a mutually acceptable deal between Krupp and Thyssen were clearly going well after Krupp suspended its hostile takeover bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal of all efforts must be to strengthen the competitiveness of the German steel industry and to secure jobs,&quot; he said. &quot;Germany must keep its steel base.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation surfaced Friday that Krupp might not have given up efforts to take control of its larger rival.</p>
<p>Banking sources said it was likely that institutional investors had secured a big chunk of Thyssen shares on behalf of Krupp. The business daily Handelsblatt said Krupp had secured 30 percent of Thyssen's capital through institutional investors.</p>
<p>But Krupp denied the newspaper report that it had gained control of about 30 percent of Thyssen stock.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not correct. We do not have any Thyssen shares,&quot; a Krupp spokesman said, adding that Krupp's banks had not accumulated Thyssen shares on its behalf either.</p>
<p>Germany's BAWe securuties trading watchdog said it had not been notified of any accumulation of Thyssen stock exceeding 5 percent. Under German law, companies must report stakes in other corporations when they reach the five percent mark.</p>
<p>Krupp launched a surprise bid last week with backing from Germany's two largest banks, Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG, and U.S. investment house Goldman Sachs. It suspended the bid after Thyssen agreed to enter week-long negotiations on forming a joint steel company.</p>
<p>Banking sources said that even without a base of Thyssen shares in hand, Krupp was determined to use a fusion with Thyssen to produce a reinvigorated German steel giant.</p>
<p>Krupp Chairman Gerhard Cromme's disregard of Germany's traditional shyness of such hostile takeovers has been sharply criticised but also won some support from those who see it as the only way to speed up needed restructuring.</p>
