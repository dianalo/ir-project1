<p>Laurent Kabila left Kinshasa on Sunday on his first foreign outing as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo with a warning for the country's political opposition that new marches could land them in court.</p>
<p>Four days after his inauguration as head of state and two weeks after his forces toppled veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Kabila left for Zimbabwe and this week's Organisation of African Unity summit.</p>
<p>But he told supporters of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi not to go ahead with the street demonstrations they have announced.</p>
<p>&quot;They are banned and it is illegal and very soon they will be taken to the courts,&quot; Kabila told Reuters Television at Kinshasa's international airport before leaving.</p>
<p>At the same time, he rejected suggestions of mistreatment of refugees in the country. &quot;Refugees are OK here. Very OK. There is nothing against refugees in our country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Adrien Phongo, spokesman Tshisekedi, said earlier fresh protests were planned.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot allow one person to have full power and leave it unchallenged,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;We are planning many actions, but the programme has not yet been publicly announced.&quot;</p>
<p>Kabila, whose Alliance of Democratic forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) entered Kinshasa on May 17 after a seven-month civil war, took office on Thursday after according himself sweeping powers and banning political activity.</p>
<p>Mazarin Mazanya, leader of a local Tshisekedi support committee, said Kabila's troops went on Saturday to the road where Tshisekedi lives and removed barricades erected at either end by his militants.</p>
<p>&quot;They warned us not to put them back again...they keep circling around to check,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;We don't know what their plan is but we have to suspect that their motive is to do harm to the prime minister (Tshisekedi).&quot;</p>
<p>Tshisekedi says he is constitutionally entitled to the post of prime minister under the terms of a 1992 vote in a sovereign national conference. Kabila has rejected the validity of the conference, part of Zaire's drawn-out democratic  transition.</p>
<p>But the Unified Lumumbist Party (PALU), which stands for the heritage of murdered independence prime minister Patrice Lumumba and has support from the poorest of Kinshasa's poor and the nearby Bandundu region, says it will give Kabila a chance.</p>
<p>&quot;We stand for the same things as the AFDL and our militants would not take action unless they believed Kabila was going against what he has said,&quot; party spokesman Frederic Izzia said.</p>
<p>Kabila left Kinshasa on Mobutu's presidential jet. It still bore Mobutu's leopard insignia and the name of Mobutu's birthplace -- Lisala. It had a blue sticker -- the republic's new colour with gold -- over a Mobutu-era insignia on the tail.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Kabila met French ambassador Michel Rougagnou -- his first formal meeting with a French official since taking office. &quot;President Kabila said that he counted on French support in the reconstruction of the country,&quot; Rougagnou said, adding that they had touched on humanitarian and other issues.</p>
<p>Kabila's government on Friday denounced &quot;a campaign of intimidation&quot; in the U.N. Security Council and rejected as defamatory suggestions of continuing massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees on its soil.</p>
<p>The Security Council appealed on Thursday for an immediate end to violence against the exiles in Kabila's Congo. It called &quot;in the strongest terms for complete cooperation with the U.N. mission investigating reports of massacres, other atrocities and violations of international law in the country&quot;.</p>
<p>The refugees are remnants of more than one million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 to escape reprisals for the genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
