<p>The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Friday that Britain would be in breach of the European Human Rights Convention if it expelled a convicted drugs courier in advanced stages of AIDS to St Kitts, his country of origin.</p>
<p>The applicant, identified only as &quot;D,&quot; arrived at London's Gatwick airport in January 1993 and was refused entry when found in possession of a substantial amount of cocaine, a court report said.</p>
<p>He was however arrested and subsequently sentenced to six years imprisonment on drugs charges. During his imprisonement, he was diagnosed as suffering from AIDS, contracted beforehand, and began to receive treatment.</p>
<p>A medical report last June then gave him no more than a year to live but he was ordered sent back to St Kitts this January, a few days before his conditional release.</p>
<p>He has since lived in Britain, supported by charities, and been involved in legal wrangling with authorities about remaining.</p>
<p>The European court noted that, despite his criminal activities, &quot;D&quot; was legally entitled to guarantees against inhuman or degrading treatment which included being sent home where local medical facilities were not judged sufficient to deal with his condition, the court said.</p>
