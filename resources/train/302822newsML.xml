<headline>NZ non-housing borrowing down in Sept qtr - Westpac.</headline>

<p>New Zealand consumer borrowing for non-housing related purposes fell in the September quarter for the first time in two years, according to the latest Westpac FPG household savings indicators.</p>
<p>Westpac Financial Services Chief Investment Officer David Beattie said borrowing for purposes other than buying a house fell by one percent or NZ$80 million in the quarter, having previously been growing steadily at around $200 million per quarter since December 1994.</p>
<p>Housing-related borrowing rose by only $760 million, whereas it had previously been rising at around $1.4 billion.  </p>
<p>Deposits held at financial institutions were relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;It would appear as though there has been an element of debt repayment occurring in the September quarter,&quot; Beattie said, adding that total deposits had previously been rising at a rate of around $1 billion per quarter.</p>
<p>He said it was too early to conclude that New Zealanders had made a permanent shift in savings patterns, but the signs were encouraging.  </p>
<p>Lower consumer borrowing could, however, mean households were trying to cut debt after a spending surge before tax cuts that took effect last July. If so, higher consumer borrowing could resume in the December quarter, Beattie said.</p>
<p>The overall net worth of New Zealanders fell 0.9 percent in the September quarter, largely because of a 0.6 percent fall in house prices over the same period.</p>
