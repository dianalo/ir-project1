<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysia ringgit falls sharply in volatile trade.</title>
<headline>Malaysia ringgit falls sharply in volatile trade.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-07-24</dateline>

<p>The Malaysian ringgit fell below the crucial 2.65 to a dollar barrier around 0133 GMT in volatile trade, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said volumes were thin and spreads wide.</p>
<p>At 0137 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.6500/50 to a dollar against around 2.6370 an hour earlier.  </p>
<p>&quot;All regional currencies are falling this morning led by the Thai baht,&quot; said a market analyst with a Singapore-based research firm.</p>
<p>He said the selldown was triggered by an unconfirmed rumour that the Bank of Thailand was planning to lift restrictions on swaps, which have created a two-tier market, one domestic and other overseas.</p>
<p>&quot;There does not seem much basis for the rumour,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said no central bank of the region was present in the market. On Wednesday, Bank Negara was said to be in the market checking through some agent banks.</p>
<p>The currencies are widely expected to be left untouched by the authorities until a meeting of Asian central banks in Shanghai over the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;If no clear policy emerges from the central banks' meeting, Monday should again be a roller coaster ride,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The head of regional currencies at a European bank in Singapore said the Singapore dollar's sharp decline in the morning was responsible for sentiment around the region weakening.</p>
<p>&quot;When a current account surplus country like Singapore can be hit so badly, where do other countries, which have huge deficits, stand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said dollar/ringgit was trading at a premium to the September futures contract on the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE), which closed at 2.6450 on Wednesday.</p>
