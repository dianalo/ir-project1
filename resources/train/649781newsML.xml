<p>China on Tuesday warned Tokyo to act carefully to avoid destabilising the Asia-Pacific region with moves to boost its military profile and strengthen a security alliance between Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>Washington and Tokyo at the weekend unveiled new plans to revamp their strategic relationship and widen potential military cooperation -- always a highly sensitive issue for China, which suffered hugely from Japanese aggression in the 1930s and 40s.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope Japan can take lessons from history by acting cautiously and walking the road of peaceful development,&quot; said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japan-U.S. security alliance is a bilateral arrangement formed during the Cold War,&quot; Cui told a regular news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;With the end of the Cold War, there is no reason for this kind of arrangement to go beyond the scope of the two sides,&quot; he said, adding that limiting cooperation would prevent the introduction of instability to the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Japan's military intentions were always a matter of extreme sensitivity among its Asian neighbours, Cui said.</p>
<p>Tokyo has long been keen to soothe lingering Chinese suspicions that it is edging toward a revival of the kind of militarism that sent Japanese forces raging across much of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Revised guidelines for military cooperation with the United States are expected to give Japan its highest military profile since defeat in World War Two shattered Tokyo's imperial dream.</p>
<p>Emissaries sent by Japan to Beijing to explain the revised guidelines had promised that the general scope of the alliance with Washington would be unchanged and that the pacifist Japanese constitution would not be breached, Cui said.</p>
<p>Last week, defence policymakers from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) briefed Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on the U.S.-Japan defence plans.</p>
<p>Japanese diplomats said a senior official from Tokyo's Foreign Ministry and defence agency visited Beijing on Sunday and Monday to explain the plans to counterparts in the Chinese government and three-million-strong People's Liberation Army.</p>
<p>Chinese officials had praised the visit as helping to increase the transparency of Washington and Tokyo's intentions, said one Japanese diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;They appreciated very much the fact that they had come from Japan to explain this... and they said this was an expression of the sincerity of the Japanese side,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Washington officials are also expected to visit China to brief leaders on the new-look alliance, but U.S. diplomats in Beijing said it was not yet clear when they would arrive.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly accused hostile forces in the United States of trying to pursue a Cold War-style policy of containment through regional alliances and the arming of Beijing's island arch-rival Taiwan.</p>
<p>To Beijing, closer military ties between Tokyo and Washington could also raise the spectre of U.S. support for Japanese territorial claims that are contested by China.</p>
<p>Chinese officials this month called for Sino-Japanese talks to ease a long-simmering dispute over ownership of an uninhabited but potentially resource-rich island group in the East China Sea that is controlled by Tokyo.</p>
<p>Tensions over the islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus and in China as the Diaoyus, have risen in recent months after Japanese legislators prompted outrage in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan by visiting them to bolster Tokyo's claim.</p>
