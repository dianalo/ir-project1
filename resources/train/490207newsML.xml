<p>The one percent figure of</p>
<p>Hungary's gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1996, released</p>
<p>on Friday, was slightly above expectations but would not lead</p>
<p>to a change in forecasts for 1997, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Central Statistical Office (KSH) said that Hungary's</p>
<p>GDP increased by one percent in 1996, compared with 1.5 percent</p>
<p>in 1995, according to preliminary figures.</p>
<p>Household consumption and investments both dropped by three</p>
<p>percent last year, while exports rose 10 percent and imports</p>
<p>increased seven percent, the KSH said.</p>
<p>This was the fourth time that the KSH released preliminary</p>
<p>quarterly GDP figures, testing a new method of calculations.</p>
<p>Budapest Bank chief analyst Peter Bihari said the figures</p>
<p>for 1996 were better than expected.</p>
<p>Budapest Bank's forecast for the 1996 GDP growth was 0.5</p>
<p>percent, while they said household consumption was likely to</p>
<p>drop by four percent and investments by 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>But the difference was not large enough to trigger</p>
<p>far-reaching conclusions, and the bank was not likely to change</p>
<p>its forecast of 1.5 to three percent for 1997 GDP growth.</p>
<p>&quot;(The difference) is within the error margin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;These figures were calculated according to an experimental</p>
<p>method and I guess they will be corrected downward.</p>
<p>GKI Economic Research Judit Barta also said the KSH figures</p>
<p>were likely to be modified in the future, however she added</p>
<p>that the figures caused some surprise to GKI.</p>
<p>&quot;(The GDP growth figure) is pleasing as we projected</p>
<p>stagnation on the basis of figures released so far,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the second half of last year there must have been quite</p>
<p>good growth, to produce that average figure.&quot;</p>
<p>The KSH said the GDP grew by three percent year-on-year in</p>
<p>the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with one percent in the</p>
<p>third quarter and stagnation in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Household consumption continued to drop in the third and</p>
<p>fourth quarters, while investments already rose by six percent</p>
<p>year-on-year in the last three months of 1996, compared with</p>
<p>three percent decline in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Higher GDP growth figures for the second half of 1996,</p>
<p>taken as a basis of year-on-year GDP calculations this year,</p>
<p>may lead to slowing growth rates in the second two quarters of</p>
<p>1997, Barta added.</p>
<p>&quot;It may happen that GDP growth will be quick in the first</p>
<p>half, and somewhat slower in the second,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She added that the fresh KSH figures were unlikely to</p>
<p>encourage GKI to change its forecast for 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to expect 2.5 to three percent GDP growth,&quot;</p>
<p>she said.</p>
