<title>KENYA: Kenya forsees three-year constitutional review.</title>
<headline>Kenya forsees three-year constitutional review.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kenya's attorney-general published on Monday a draft bill to create a commission to review the constitution and said the commission would only report back in up to three years.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission shall complete its work and submit its report to the president within 24 months from the date of appointment of the commissioners or within such further period not exceeding 12 months after the end of the 24 months from the date of appointment,&quot; Amos Wako said in his draft bill.  </p>
<p>The period between the appointment of the commissioners and debate and approval in parliament could last at least three-and-a-half years, Wako's draft bill indicated.</p>
<p>It provided for at least six months for the commission report to move from the president to being presented to parliament by the government.</p>
<p>The draft bill suggested the legislative agenda after presidential and parliamentary elections later this year would be constitutional reform. No election date has been set.</p>
<p>An opposition-backed alliance has campaigned since May for constitutional reforms and the repeal of 11 laws it considers repressive before the general election.</p>
