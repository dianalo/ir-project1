<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Monday shied away from saying whether he would stay on the job if President Clinton wins a second term in November.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, what I'm going to do is focus on what I have to do between now and the end of the year,&quot; he told CNN television. &quot;There's plenty of time to make that decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you this, though,&quot; Rubin quickly added. &quot;It has really been very exciting to be involved with the president. He's made a very lot of tough decisions, good decisions for the American people.&quot;  </p>
<p>Administration officials are betting that Rubin will opt to remain Treasury chief in a second Clinton term.</p>
<p>Commerce Chief Mickey Kantor also shied away from saying whether he would stay in his post after the November election. &quot;November 5th is all I care about and after that we all await to hear from the president,&quot; Kantor told CNN.</p>
<p>Kantor is rumored to have his eye on the Attorney General job, if Janet Reno, who has Parkinson's Disease, decides not to stay on for a second term.  </p>
<p>In the joint interview on CNN, which was also joined by Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, Rubin sharply criticized Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole's economic plan.</p>
<p>Dole, who trails Clinton in opinion polls, has called for $548 billion in tax cuts and a balanced budget over six years.</p>
<p>Rubin charged that the Dole plan would bloat the deficit, push up interest rates and hurt the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The across-the-board tax cuts that Dole has proposed will explode the deficit...will cause interest rates to go back up (and) undermine the economy,' the Treasury chief said. &quot;This plan cannot work. This plan cannot provide the tax cuts he's proposed and also balance the budget.&quot;</p>
