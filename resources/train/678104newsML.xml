<title>UNITED NATIONS: Four countries plan Earth Summit iniative at UN.</title>

<p>Germany, Brazil, South Africa and Singapore are planning an initiative at next week's special summit meeting on the environment to jump-start action to reduce pollution and protect the world's forests.</p>
<p>The four also want global environmental issues to be more closely anchored in the United Nations system, according to a statement they issued.</p>
<p>The focus, they said, would be on &quot;measures aimed at protecting climate and forests as well a problems of urban development.&quot; But the four deliberately have kept most of the details secret.</p>
<p>The plans will be announced on Monday, the opening day of a five-day special U.N. Assembly session on the environment by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, South African deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Sinapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.</p>
<p>Separately, Kohl. making his first visit ever to the United Nations, is known to advocate a world U.N. environmental center, preferably in Bonn,  grouping together many of the world body's programs, departments and agencies dealing with similar subjects.</p>
<p>These would include the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development, created as a follow up to the  historic 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, as well as the Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program, known as UNEP.</p>
<p>Several diplomats welcomed the grouping of environmental bodies but said UNEP, currently being reorganized, should not be relocated in the near future.</p>
<p>Germany in the last five years has attempted to fill a leadership void on the environment long held by the United States and led climate treaty negotiations in Berlin in 1995.</p>
<p>Under terms of the treaty, industrial countries have to hold emissions of so-called greenhouses gases that effect climate changes below the 1990 level by the year 2,000, a commitment Germany is expected to fulfill.</p>
<p>Next week's summit is expected to push for goals past the year 2,000 although only the European Union has proposed specific numbers while the United States and others want no targets set until a December meeting in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p>Germany, which emits more greenhouse gases than any other European country, has established tougher emission standards and programs for energy efficiency than most of its neighbors. But it still grants $5.3 billion in coal industry subsidies.</p>
