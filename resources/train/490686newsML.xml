<p>The Russian central bank promised on Monday to give foreign investors full rights to repatriate profits from government securities, but said it might curb the volume of foreign funds being used to play the market.</p>
<p>Deputy chairman Alexander Potyomkin told reporters that central bank foreign currency reserves had risen by $1.5 billion in March, putting liquid assets at about $12 billion -- well over the $10 billion level he said was wise.</p>
<p>&quot;We view the future with certainty,&quot; he said. &quot;The most important decision is how, by the beginning of 1998, to end the limits on non-residents... From January 1 a foreigner can put in money and two days later, say, take it out.&quot;</p>
<p>But Chairman Sergei Dubinin told a separate news conference the bank was developing measures to limit the volume of foreign funds targeted at T-bills from flowing into the country.</p>
<p>A number of emerging markets have been hit hard in the past when foreign money on short-term deposit flooded out of the country due to a confidence crisis, notably from Mexico in late 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;In some sense because of the Mexican syndrome, we are worried about more dependence on foreign investors,&quot; Dubinin said, adding that such rules met International Monetary Fund (IMF) requirements on capital flows.</p>
<p>Foreign investors make up about 15 percent of the Russian T-bill market and average yields have fallen to the low-30s from the mid-40s last autumn and nearly 200 percent early last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sure that the risks of unexpected flights by foreigners has decreased sharply. On the other hand, our hard currency reserves allow us to insure the market against unexpected major flight by non-residents,&quot; Potyomkin said.</p>
<p>Russia insures against capital flight by requiring that foreigners invest in government securities through special &quot;S&quot; accounts and make compensatory forward and options deals in order to make repatriation of profits a slow process.</p>
<p>Andrei Kozlov, another deputy chairman, told reporters that foreigners would still have to channel investment into the GKO discount treasury bill and OFZ government bond market through &quot;S&quot; accounts, which allowed the bank to monitor funds better.</p>
<p>But the bank would cut the required length of forwards and options from two and four months respectively at present to nothing by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Dubinin said foreign investors put $700 million to $1 billion in the market every month. The market has about $1 billion daily turnover and a trading value of $44 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;By stages the final dollar yield on GKOs is nearing yields of paper on foreign markets... I'm speaking of Eurobonds...and it may be said there is no need for compulsory forward deals with the Central Bank,&quot; Potyomkin said.</p>
<p>Robert Devane, head of fixed income at Troika-Dialog bank in Moscow, said the earning yield in dollar terms on longer-term securities, adjusted for rouble depreciation, was over 20 percent.</p>
<p>He said market liberalisation combined with talk of limits on foreign investment inflows was good news.</p>
<p>&quot;What they are talking about is just not letting the door stay open and unwatched,&quot; he said. &quot;It is perfectly reasonable and it doesn't mean they will set a certain limit (on foreign investment) at any time.</p>
<p>&quot;It would concern me a lot more if they said they would allow foreigners to invest anything they wanted in the T-bill market.&quot;</p>
