<title>SYRIA: Syrian paper encouraged by policy of UK's Blair.</title>
<headline>Syrian paper encouraged by policy of UK's Blair.</headline>
<dateline>DAMASCUS 1997-05-03</dateline>

<p>An official Syrian newspaper said on Saturday it believed new British Prime Minister Tony Blair would give Europe a greater role in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;Blair said he would support peace on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks and that he was committed to the land-for-peace principle which constitutes the core of the peace process,&quot; the Tishreen daily said.</p>
<p>&quot;These statements are, no doubt, encouraging,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>Syria has condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of swapping occupied Arab lands for peace. It said negotiations with Israel, halted for over a year, would not resume until Netanyahu showed readiness to return all the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967.</p>
<p>Tishreen said Britain and Europe have a chance to increase their influence in the Middle East peace process from the United States, the main broker of the Arab-Israeli peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;With the shrinking of the U.S. role due to the flagrant U.S. submission to Israel, the region and the world look for a more effective European role. Britain can contribute to the shaping of this role as Blair himself declared,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Britain could stand firmly in support of a just and comprehensive peace and could contribute with other European states to rescue the peace proces,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
<p>The paper criticised the policy of the outgoing British Conservative Party: &quot;Positions of the Conservatives were in fact disappointing. It was biased to Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>Syrian-British ties were strained under the Conservatives. Britain severed diplomatic ties with Syria in 1986 after accusing Damascus of involvement in a plot to bomb an Israeli plane flying from London.</p>
<p>Ties were restored in 1990 prior to the Gulf War when Syrian and British forces joined the U.S.-led multinational force that drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait after six months of occupation.</p>
