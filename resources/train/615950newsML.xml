<title>FRANCE: TENNIS-HINGIS BACK IN ACTION.</title>
<headline>TENNIS-HINGIS BACK IN ACTION.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>World number one Martina Hingis will be back in action on Tuesday, eager to show the tennis world she has bounced back from her much-publicised horse-riding accident a month ago.</p>
<p>The Swiss teenager, who has not played in competition since she was thrown by her mount and underwent arthroscopic knee surgery, will return to the fray at the French Open against Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia as she sets out in search of her second consecutive grand slam title.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't played that many practice matches but I started to practise three or four days after I had the surgery,&quot; said Hingis.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel pretty good about this tournament because I've had a lot of physiotherapy in the last three or four weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Nagyova, a clay courter who is ranked a respectable 37th in the world and has beaten several top players including South Africa's Amanda Coetzer, is likely to provide Hingis with a much tougher test than she would have wanted for her comeback match.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't really been off that long,&quot; explained Hingis, who hopes to go out riding while in Paris. &quot;I would have taken three weeks off before coming here anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll just go on the court and try to play my best and if it works -- great. If it doesn't, there are other tournaments.&quot;</p>
<p>Defending champion Steffi Graf, who does not begin the tournament as its top seed for the first time in five years, will put her tender knee to the test against Argentina's Paola Suarez, a 1992 French Open junior finalist, as she chases a sixth French crown.</p>
<p>Like Hingis, Graf, the winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, will be fighting her way back from injury having returned to action just two weeks ago after being out for three months with an injured knee.</p>
<p>Sixth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, a winner in 1994 and a finalist for the last two years, will take on France's Karolina Jagieniak, the second-lowest ranked player in the women's field at 318.</p>
<p>All three women will be hoping the trend established on Monday, with all the women's seeds who saw action making it through safely to the second round, will continue.</p>
<p>Monica Seles, a three-time winner who has yet to post a tournament victory this season, sailed smoothly into the next round. The third seed disposed of Japan's Miho Saeki 6-0 6-3 in just 44 minutes.</p>
<p>Tenth seed Mary Pierce, a French finalist in 1994, survived her opening test but was booed off the court as she struggled to a 6-2 4-6 6-4 win over Russia's Tatiana Panova.</p>
<p>On the men's side, a pair of former champions -- Americans Michael Chang and Jim Courier -- will be hoping to follow compatriot and world number one Pete Sampras into round two on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chang, the number two seed and a winner in 1989, will meet French qualifier Rodolphe Gilbert, ranked 223 in the world while Courier, winner of back-to-back titles in 1991 and 1992, will face a stern test against Sweden's Magnus Larsson, ranked 40 in the world.</p>
<p>Fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic, will also face a tough Swedish challenge in Magnus Gustafsson, ranked 39.</p>
