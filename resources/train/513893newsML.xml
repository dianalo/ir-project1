<p>The U.N. Human Rights Commission hit at Colombia on Wednesday over &quot;endemic violence&quot; caused both by state agents and guerrillas and voiced concern about the increasing involvement of para-military groups.</p>
<p>The 53-member body said it was deeply concerned by &quot;thousands of violations&quot; of the right to life in Colombia.</p>
<p>&quot;This conflict entails serious and continuous abuses and violations of human rights and humanitarian law both by the state agents and guerrilla groups,&quot; it said in a chairman's statement, less embarrassing for governments than resolutions which formally criticise or condemn countries accused of abuses.</p>
<p>The statement said the Commission was deeply preoccupied by disappearances in Colombia and urged guerrilla groups to stop kidnappings and indiscriminate killings.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have been killed in Colombia in attacks that police and military officials blame on the leading leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), founded as a Marxist, pro-Soviet group in 1964.</p>
<p>Leaders of the group have rebuffed a call from President Ernesto Samper for unconditional peace talks, saying they have no interest in negotiating with &quot;an illegitimate government.&quot;</p>
<p>The embattled president has been weakened by charges he used drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign.</p>
