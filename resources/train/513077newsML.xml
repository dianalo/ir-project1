<text>
<p>Caracas stocks closed mixed in strong trade, but the  .IBC index closed up on stronger blue chips with textiles manufacturer Sudamtex leading the way, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of rumors, but all that's clear is that people were buying the company at any price,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Sudamtex Series I shares closed up 3.15 bolivars at 36.70, while its Series II shares rose 3.20 bolivars to 36.75 as gossip swirled around the market that the company would soon issue shares, re-jig its executive board, and/or a foreign investor was in the market to buy a large stake.  </p>
<p>Sudamtex accounted for some 20 percent of the day's trade volume of 32.5 million shares, worth four billion bolivars ($8.4 million), but Sudamtex officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The market's 19-share  .IBC index closed ahead 0.2 percent at 6,243.31 points even as 17 stocks fell, 14 rose and five closed flat. The Merinvest's composite index, which includes telephone company CANTV, meanwhile rose 0.19 percent to end at 95.67 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;The session was moved by focused interest in certain stocks. Otherwise, prices pretty much closed flat,&quot; said one broker.</p>
