<headline>Manila stock index ends up despite more losers.</headline>
<dateline>MANILA 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue chips pushed up the Manila stock index at the close on Tuesday even as losers dominated trading due to uncertainties over domestic interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt sleepy throughout. There's not not much going on in the market as foreign funds seem to have been locked in money market instruments,&quot; said Sapphire Securities research head Henry Ong.</p>
<p>The composite index ended higher by 8.39 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,656.73.  </p>
<p>But losers trounced gainers 68 to 45, with the prices of 54 other issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Trading was light with some 1.36 billion pesos worth of shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Brokers said blue chips, led by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co, saved the index from being moored in negative territory at the end of the session.</p>
<p>They said investors have started positioning in companies which are perceived to report better earnings in the second quarter of the year. -- Dolly Aglay (63 2) 841-8936</p>
