<p>Residents of this northern Jordan town offered blood and sympathy for Israeli schoolgirls who were shot by a Jordanian soldier on Thursday but blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The attack should not have been against young innocent children but against Netanyahu who is stubborn and a tyrant,&quot; said Mifleh Awad, an elderly farmer sitting with other locals in a coffee shop in the centre of Shuna, 75 km (45 miles) north of Amman.</p>
<p>Seven Israeli schoolgirls were killed and six wounded when the soldier opened fire on them on a field trip to a Jordan border site nicknamed &quot;The Island of Peace.&quot;</p>
<p>Hospital workers and doctors said over 20 people rushed to donate blood to the victims after Jordanian military cars took them to the local hospital here a few km (miles) from where the shooting took place.</p>
<p>But residents said their sympathy for the victims did not diminish their fury with Netanyahu, whose plans to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem has sparked widespread anger in the Arab world.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu's behaviour has pushed this soldier to commit this act ... this was bound to happen. Israel has been encouraging this with the building of settlements,&quot; said one youth who refused to give his name.</p>
<p>&quot;The soldier is an ordinary citizen who has felt let down and was not ready to keep his emotions seeing his people (Palestinians) there across the river being destroyed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What can Netanyahu expect if Palestinian Arab land is usurped ... When your land is taken over, you are entitled to resist by all means,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Sheikh Yousef Ahmed, a local elder, said Israel wanted domination not genuine peace with its neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;All the Jordanian people extended their hands for peace but the Israelis have not extended their hands fully for an honourable, just and comprehensive peace,&quot; he said, echoing widespread disappointment by ordinary Jordanians with the few gains so far from the 1994 peace treaty with Israel.</p>
<p>The Jordanian soldier was said to be a 26-year-old army driver who started his posting at the border area earlier this year.</p>
<p>One of his army comrades identified him as Ahmed Moussa, from the town of Adasiya, a few km (miles) from the site of the shooting, on the joint border defined under a 1994 peace treaty between the two countries.</p>
<p>An electronic security fence runs along parts of the frontier but violent incidents are rare.</p>
