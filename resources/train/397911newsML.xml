<headline>Yoshitomi, Green Cross to merge on Oct 1.</headline>
<dateline>OSAKA, Japan 1997-02-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japanese drug makers Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Green Cross Corp announced on Monday that they would merge on October 1.  </p>
<p>They said that five shares of Green Cross will be exchanged for three Yoshitomi shares.</p>
<p>Green Cross will be dissolved upon the merger, they said.</p>
<p>The merged company is expected to have sales of 150 billion yen and parent current profit of 14.5 billion yen in the fiscal year ending in March 1998, the companies said.  </p>
<p>Yoshitomi's president Masashi Goya will take the helm of the new company, while Green Cross president Kazunari Doi will be the executive vice president.</p>
<p>The companies said the merged firm would be able to compete with top Japanese drug makers in the international arena, since Green Cross has relatively strong overseas operations while Yoshitomi is strong domestically.</p>
<p>They also said they would be able to merge their research laboratories, factories and marketing offices.</p>
<p>Green Cross is strong in selling to hospitals while Yoshitomi has strong sales to psychiatric hospitals and small clinics.</p>
<p>However, some analysts said that while the merger would help Green Cross prop itself up in the aftermath of a scandal involving HIV-tainted blood products which broke last year, the advantages for Yoshitomi were not all clear.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to see immediately how Yoshitomi will merit from the merger as Green Cross is losing money due to boycotts of its products,&quot; said Mitsuo Ohmi, an analyst at Smith Barney International Inc.  </p>
<p>Green Cross was hit by a boycott of its products by many medical institutions throughout Japan as a result of the scandal, in which former executives of the company were arrested on suspicion of knowingly selling HIV-tainted blood products.</p>
<p>The company faces compensation payments totalling about 24 billion yen to people who were infected with HIV through its blood products.</p>
<p>Before the merger announcement, Green Cross announced separately that it had revised up its parent current profit forecast for 1996/97 to 500 million yen from an initial estimate of a 2.50 billion yen loss.  </p>
<p>Yoshihiko Yamamoto, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd, said the merger may put an end to the boycott and help Green Cross return to profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger will likely provide a reason for hospitals to end the boycott as it would solve the image problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said that Green Cross has the technology to develop new blood products.</p>
<p>The company is preparing to launch a new blood product developed with bio-technology which could be sold worldwide and generate revenue of 30 billion yen annually, he said.  </p>
<p>Doi told a news conference on Monday that the company would consider turning its blood-products division into a separate firm after the merger.</p>
<p>The company said last September that it planned to streamline its operations.</p>
<p>It said it would close two of its four plants in Japan by 2000 and reduce its workforce from the current 2,400 to 2,000 within three to four years.</p>
<p>Doi said that the restructuring plans would not be greatly altered as result of the merger.</p>
<p>He also said: &quot;The worst was over in terms of the boycotts around December and January.&quot;</p>
<p>The firms said the new company would take over the responsibility of paying compensation to the HIV victims.</p>
