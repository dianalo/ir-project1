<p>Dozens of investigators combed through charred w near Miami International Airport Friday amid fears that at least two people might have been killed on the ground when a cargo jet crashed.</p>
<p>The Metro-Dade county police department said it received telephone reports that two people had been missing since the 29-year-old Fine Air Services Inc. DC-8-61F aircraft slammed through a busy commercial district at lunchtime Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been two calls about people who are missing,&quot; said department spokesman Juan Del Castillo. &quot;If they are there (in the wreckage) or not, we don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>All four members of the cargo jet's crew also were believed to have perished in the disaster, although the bodies of only three people had been recovered at the crash scene.</p>
<p>At least 25 investigators, including 15 from the National Transportation Safety Board, were working on the crash, NTSB Chairman James Hall told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The team held an organisational meeting early this morning and investigators are at work as I am speaking to you now,&quot; he said, standing near piles of ashy wreckage and charred automobiles left by the crash.</p>
<p>Hall said the NTSB was investigating everything about the crashed jet and the company that ran it, which announced Friday it was rescinding an initial public stock offering it began Wednesday.</p>
<p>Separately, the Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it has proposed to suspend for 60 to 90 days the certificates of 29 pilots who fly for Fine Air in an action unrelated to the Miami crash. Fine also has been in a dispute with the government of Peru, which alleged the company had illegally transported arms to Ecuador</p>
<p>Hall said workers at the NTSB's laboratory in Washington, already stretched from this week's air disaster in Guam, had laboured through the night examining data from the jet's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.</p>
<p>The Fine aircraft laden with thousands of pounds of fabric had slammed through a busy commercial district adjacent to the airport seconds after takeoff, smashing cars, sending up columns of black smoke and scattering flaming wreckage.</p>
<p>But though dozens of small offices near the crash site sustained some damage and remained closed, investigators called it miraculous that there were no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries in the busy commercial district.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, it is somewhat of a miracle that the passage of the aircraft stopped short of the buildings, and areas where obviously additional individuals were located and could have been killed,&quot; Hall said.</p>
<p>WSVN, the local Fox television affiliate, reported Friday that Renato Alvarez, a 34-year-old Miami resident, had been missing since early Thursday afternoon, when he telephoned his wife at her office near the Fine Air crash site and told her he would be arriving shortly with lunch for both of them.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling that he is there (in the wreckage). I have just this gut feeling that he is there,&quot; his wife, Maria Alvarez, told the television station, adding that neither she nor anyone had heard from her husband since the crash.</p>
<p>Investigators at the crash site said they would have no more information on any possible victims until they had spent several more hours on the search.</p>
<p>Sam Williams, assistant director of the Metro-Dade police department, said police teams were charting the crash site into a giant grid, and would spend the day walking over it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very lengthy process, it's almost an inch by inch process. We don't want to leave any stone unturned,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The three bodies pulled from the wreckage Thursday had not been identified.</p>
<p>As Hall and the other officials spoke with reporters, their news conference was interrupted by shouts of &quot;Smoke, smoke,&quot; as a plume of black smoke eerily similar to that from the Fine crash rose about a mile from the crash site.</p>
<p>Police raced to the scene, to find a burning, overturned tanker truck. The smoke from the tanker crash forced closure of a runway at Miami International Airport.</p>
