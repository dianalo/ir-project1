<title>CANADA: Morgan Hydrocarbons climbs on takeover talk.</title>
<headline>Morgan Hydrocarbons climbs on takeover talk.</headline>
<dateline>CALGARY 1996-09-11</dateline>

<p>Shares of Morgan Hydrocarbons Inc climbed in heavy volume for the third day on Wednesday as takeover rumors about the Calgary-based oil and gas producer swirled through the investment and energy industries.</p>
<p>Morgan rose 0.40 to 4.50 on 1.6 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has soared from 3.75 on September 6.</p>
<p>Morgan, which earlier this year was close to a merger with Numac Energy Inc and later acquired International Colin Energy, has often been cited as a takeover target.  </p>
<p>Industry sources said a possible suitor was Stampeder Exploration Ltd, which like Morgan, is a large oil producer in Saskatchewan. Stampeder earlier this year acquired Ballistic Energy for about C$120 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I hear the same thing, but I don't know who is doing what,&quot; said an analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The analyst said he heard another potential suitor was Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd, which also has a strong Saskatchewan presence.</p>
<p>Senior executives from Stampeder and Morgan were unavailable for comment.  </p>
<p>Early this year, Morgan's International Colin buyout was met with criticism from Morgan's Hong Kong-based major shareholder, Smart On Resources.</p>
<p>The unrest culminated in a move by a Smart On representative at Morgan's May annual meeting to force a vote approving the company's board of directors. An overwhelming majority of Morgan shareholders supported the current board.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Morgan president Bill Trickett suggested to reporters that Smart On may have to sell its investment in the company because of differences in opinion on how the company should be run.  </p>
<p>Reports from last spring placed the value of Morgan at about C$300 million.</p>
