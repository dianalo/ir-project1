<p>President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Robert Parry said it is &quot;absolutely essential&quot; the central bank be forward looking in its fight against inflation.</p>
<p>Parry, speaking to reporters here, said he was &quot;surprised&quot; that inflation has not yet shown up in the U.S. economy as it would be expected under conventional economic models.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed always has to be forward looking and cannot wait until problems surface. It can take six months to two years for inflation to show up so I think it's absolutely essential for the Fed to be forward looking,&quot; Parry said.  </p>
<p>Parry said he believes U.S. inflation is in a modest upward trend, adding that he was more concerned about the Consumer Price Index (CPI) being above financial market forecasts rather than below them.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the indications are on the uppick. I'm more concerned about inflation being above the (financial markets') forecast than below the forecast,&quot; Parry said.</p>
<p>He also said he sees few signs of wage pressures in U.S. labor markets, adding that he was watching excess capacity in the economy as a potential inflation source.  </p>
<p>Parry said regional upward pressure on wages was particularly seen in the northwest part of the U.S. and in the Silicon Valley in California.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are few overall signs of wage inflation,&quot; Parry said.</p>
<p>&quot;My concern is the result of the fact that there appears to be a little excess capacity. I don't see the inflation signs, but I see the factors that precede an increase in inflation,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>He was referring to the current low unemployment rate and high capacity utilization of the U.S. economy. &quot;Those factors would lead one to be cautious,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Parry also said he expects first quarter Gross Domestic Product growth to be around 3.0 percent and a little under 2.5 percent for all of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had to pick a round number (for Q1 GDP), it would be a three (percent) ... I would expect growth of a little less than 2.5 percent for the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said the real federal funds rate is currently &quot;not too wide off the mark.&quot;</p>
