<p>Michigan lawmakers have adopted a $9.2 billion fiscal 1998 budget for elementary and secondary education including a more than $600 million increase in spending.</p>
<p>The overall school funding plan adopted Thursday exceeds Michigan's entire general fund budget for fiscal 1998, the state budget office reported.</p>
<p>Also Thursday, Michigan senators advanced a plan from Treasurer Doug Roberts to create an authority to issue up to $1 billion of debt to fully fund the public school pension system.</p>
<p>The Roberts plan would require districts to waive claims against the state in a funding lawsuit now before the Michigan Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Bonds would be issued only if sufficient numbers of districts and other units adopt a resolution and submit it to the treasurer on or before August 15.</p>
<p>The plan still needs House approval.</p>
<p>The legislature's approved overall spending package addresses any possible costs incurred by the state as a result of the school funding lawsuit as well, the budget office said.</p>
<p>Michigan Gov. John Engler said the budget approval will permit planning for the next year and &quot;commended&quot; lawmakers for addressing the possible costs of the lawsuit that challenged old special education funding practices.</p>
<p>Supreme Court justices ruled for the districts in June and requested additional court filings before determining what compensation, if any, the state must make to them.</p>
<p>The state budget office has estimated that Michigan could face a liability of from $500 million to $3.5 billion in retroactive and future claims from districts statewide.</p>
<p>Lawmakers set the special education budget at $752 million for fiscal 1998 as well in the package to be forwarded to Engler.</p>
<p>Michigan lawmakers are due back in Lansing Tuesday. They have not completed work on a road funding budget or addressed capital outlay requests for fiscal 1998 beginning October 1.</p>
