<title>USA: Florida to begin citrus exports to New Zealand.</title>
<headline>Florida to begin citrus exports to New Zealand.</headline>
<dateline>TALLAHASSEE, Fla 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Florida state citrus officials said Thursday they reached an  agreement with the New Zealand government to allow fresh citrus shipments from Florida to enter New Zealand for the first time.</p>
<p>Previously denied access because of quarantine restrictions, shipments may soon be flowing to New Zealand from Florida groves, according to Richard Kenny, Florida Fruit Packers Association.</p>
<p>The agreement, negotiated through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was finalized earlier this week.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've got certain pests and diseases that they certainly don't want down there and vice versa,'' Kenny said. &quot;We exchanged disease lists and  we addressed the diseases that they were concerned about and satisfied their concerns.&quot;</p>
<p>Florida growers had petitioned to gain access to the New Zealand market as part of the Uruguay round of GATT talks. The market represents about 3 million potential consumers. A pact over quarantine procedures was agreed to in principle last month but the details of  the agreement were not finalized until Jan. 27, Kenny said.  </p>
<p>Last year, offshore shipments of Florida citrus passed 23 million boxes.</p>
<p>Although the opening of the new market will not have a dramatic impact on Florida citrus exports, Kenny said the agreement will still benefit Florida growers. At this time, New Zealand officials have not requested a similar deal.</p>
<p>&quot;They've got 3 million people down there so its an incremental thing. Kenny said. &quot;It's  a long way down there, but every little bit helps.&quot;  </p>
<p>Under the agreement, fruit entering New Zealand must come from Florida groves that have been  certified to be free of Caribbean fruit flies, a citrus pest that can cause extensive damage. The fruit then must pass through a series of protocols before it can be accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;This  has been a long time coming,&quot; said Bobby McKown, executive vice president of  Florida Citrus Mutual, Florida's largest growers association. &quot;The breakthrough in New Zealand will  help to us with Australia as well.  We're hammering away at all those markets.&quot;</p>
