<title>UK: UK parachutists sues over jump that went wrong.</title>
<headline>UK parachutists sues over jump that went wrong.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>A British woman badly injured in a &quot;tandem&quot; parachute jump on Thursday said she would sue her fellow parachutist for 50,000 pounds in compensation for her injuries.</p>
<p>Elyse Gorham, an experienced parachutist and competitive swimmer, was making her first tandem jump, and strapped to another parachutist Christopher Murphy, who was in control of the jump.</p>
<p>The jump went badly wrong. The parachute failed to open and several of the seams in the the reserve parachute split. The pair hit the ground at 40 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Gorham, 26, suffered a broken leg, heel and pelvis and five broken ribs and was left with extensive scars. She still suffers constant pain and has difficulty walking, according to a writ issued in Britain's High Court.</p>
<p>She accuses Murphy of giving her the wrong instructions and of not acting promptly enough to save her from injury.</p>
<p>Earlier this week another British skydiver, Gareth Griffiths, survived a 13,000 foot fall in the United States when his instructor sacrificed his own life to save him.</p>
<p>The instructor, Michael Costello from Florida, twisted over onto his back in the last seconds of the fall, cushioning Griffith's landing.</p>
<p>No date has yet been fixed for Goram's case.</p>
