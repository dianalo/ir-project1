<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle early Tuesday were again bid at $67.00 per cwt, but passed by owners asking $69.00 to $70.00, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales were not expected to occur until Wednesday as packers reportedly had sufficient live inventories until then following last week's trade, they said.</p>
<p>The bulk of last week's sales were at $67.00, although a few head were reported late at $68.00.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be another day or two before something happens, and then it will either be $68.00 or $69.00,&quot; a Panhandle-area feedlot manager said.  </p>
<p>Fed cattle prices were expected to be underpinned by outlooks for continued strong beef prices and light supplies of market-ready cattle on this week's showlists, they said.</p>
<p>Beef on Monday was quoted up $0.83 to $1.33 per cwt, with 115 fabricated loads reported sold, USDA said.</p>
<p>Heavier-weight choice beef was quoted up $1.06 at $102.84, up $3.59 since prices turned higher last Thursday, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Strength in the beef was tied to revived demand as retailers book orders for beef promotions aimed near the end of the month, market sources said.</p>
