<p>French conglomerate Cie Generale des Eaux said on Friday it would be back in profit for 1996 after making big strides in cutting debt and nearly doubling asset disposals last year.</p>
<p>&quot;These results testify to the group's determination to put into effect the strategic development policy and refocusing announced to the market in these past few months,&quot; the utilities, construction and communications group said.</p>
<p>A spokesman reiterated the company expected a 1.8 billion franc ($344.2 million) profit for 1996 after diving to a 3.7 billion franc loss in 1995, the first negative result in its history, hit by a huge charge for exposure to a depressed property market.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have a profit of 1.8 billion francs for 1996 and expect a profit of around four billion in 1997,&quot; well above 1994's record 3.44 billion francs, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Net attributable profits totalled more than 800 million francs for the first half of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We took the bull by the horns...our (restructuring) policy is starting to bear fruit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shares finished up 1.43 percent at 638 francs.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie Messier, appointed chairman last year to clear out the group's balance sheet which had accumulated more than 50 billion francs of debt, has called 1996 a &quot;year of transition.&quot;</p>
<p>He has set the company a target of lifting its return on equity to 15 percent by 1999.</p>
<p>The company said it had slashed debt by four billion francs in 1996 to just under 48 billion francs and that it aimed to cut it by a further 10 to 15 billion francs in 1997.</p>
<p>To achieve this, most of the company's minority holdings have been put up for sale, and the company has also decided to quit catering and health care.</p>
<p>Generale des Eaux said it sold some 5.8 billion francs worth of real estate assets in 1996, including two buildings at Paris's La Defense business district, compared with 646 million francs worth of property sales the previous year.</p>
<p>It also made some 7.5 billion francs of other disposals, mainly industrial stakes.</p>
<p>It said strategic alliances with international partners had allowed it to boost the balance sheets of various subsidiaries by 5.4 billion francs through capital increases.</p>
<p>It said it planned to press ahead with more disposals and that talks were continuing in its quest for new partners for Generale de Sante, one of Europe's leading private hospital operators.</p>
<p>The company is making its accounting standards conform with international practice in a move seen as a possible prelude to an eventual foreign listing. ($1=5.230 French Franc)</p>
