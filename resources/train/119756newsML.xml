<p>U.S. investment house JP Morgan has developed a method of calculating real-time market expectations of European monetary union taking place.</p>
<p>In a note to clients, the firm's head of currency research in Europe, Avinash Persaud, said ebb and flow of the market's belief in EMU happening is best monitored via bond yield spreads in the swaps market between participating European countries.</p>
<p>To accurately monitor this regularly, you need to know what the spread would be if EMU takes place, what it is now and what the price would be if EMU was not any part of the equation, said Persaud.</p>
<p>Nominal exchange rates or nominal bond yields are not accurate in this respect because there is no certainty at what exchange rates EMU will be fixed or at what level bond yields will converge.</p>
<p>&quot;The one thing we know for certain is that after EMU day bond spreads in the swaps market between two countries participating in EMU will be zero,&quot; Persaud said.</p>
<p>Finding the non-EMU level of swap spreads is more complicated, however.</p>
<p>To get that level, it is not fair to simply strip out the EMU effect by looking solely at indicators such as inflation and budget deficits because these have been heavily influenced by the policy push to meet EMU entry criteria, said Persuad.</p>
<p>Comparing current spreads with some average historic spread is similarly vulnerable to misinterpretation because other more global phenomena like global deflation have caused spreads to narrow and not just EMU, the JP Morgan analyst said.</p>
<p>A better way to get an estimate of what European swap spreads would be without EMU is to look at measures of risk like volatility risk, inflation, default and suchlike that make up spreads everywhere around the world - spreads like U.S.-Australia or U.S. Canada spread for example.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, &quot;around 80 percent of the French- German 10-year spread can be explained by the behaviour of spreads outside Europe,&quot; said Persaud. &quot;The regression breaks down after 1994 when Europe trends a different path to the rest of the world - the EMU path.&quot;</p>
<p>As a result, using the zero spread assumed at EMU, the current spread and the estimate non-EMU spread via the above method, JP Morgan assess the relative probabilities the market places in EMU happening in any one country and can look at their change over time.</p>
<p>The EMU calculator at present classifies European countries into three tiers. First there is a core such as Germany, France, the Netherlands and Belgium where EMU is seen as almost a complete certainty.</p>
<p>Second is a border group of Sweden and Denmark, where EMU probability is between 50 and 60 percent, mainly due to domestic political difficulties in pushing the project through against public opinion.</p>
<p>Third is the periphery of Spain, Italy and Portugal where EMU probabilities are between 30 and 40 percent because of doubts about fulfilling EMU entry criteria.</p>
