<p> TIFFE Euroyen 3M (Z)	99.19		   99.19</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Key December three-month Euroyen interest rate futures closed a subdued day session unchanged on Tuesday with their topside capped by firmness in Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>A lack of activity meant there was no reaction to the record high in yen cash bond prices or to a rise in Japan's machinery orders in January, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not interested in what happened in the past,&quot; said a dealer at a long-term credit bank.  </p>
<p>The Economic Planning Agency said private machinery orders rose 11.8 percent in January from December. But machinery orders in the January-March period are seen falling 8.5 percent from the previous quarter, the EPA said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we want to know is if the economy will slow down after April or not,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>From this point of view, little attention is likely to be paid on Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) data for the October-December period due on Thursday, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;You needed a microscope to watch market activity today,&quot; said a city bank dealer.  </p>
<p>The December settled at 99.19 after moving between 99.18 and 99.19. Turnover was a small 11,642 lots.</p>
<p>The contract failed to rise despite Tuesday's rally in long-term cash bonds, with the key 182nd 10-year Japanese government bond yield falling to a record low 2.315 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We wouldn't be surprised unless the key bond yield dipped below 2.3 percent,&quot; the city bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Short-term money market rates were steady firmer after the central bank conducted a neutral operation for a second day.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) offset a market shortfall of an estimated 100 billion yen by injecting 100 billion yen.  </p>
<p>Although such an operation was expected, the key overnight interbank rate jumped to 0.51 percent from Monday's 0.49 and the benchmark three-month certificate of deposit (CD) rate rose to 0.55 percent, the highest level since August last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who were in a hurry to raise funds covering the fiscal year-end should be blamed,&quot; said another city bank dealer. &quot;Such banks had expected the BOJ to help them out.&quot;</p>
<p>Upward pressure in money market rates remained high across the yield curve despite the BOJ's late morning offer to supply funds worth a total of 900 billion yen covering the fiscal year-end, traders said. -- Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-33432-8570</p>
