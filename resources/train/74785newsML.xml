<title>UK: Med oil products stable, support from buy tenders.</title>
<headline>Med oil products stable, support from buy tenders.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-25</dateline>

<p>Mediterranean oil products were stable on Thursday in line with crude, and large buying tenders supported gas oil and fuel oil, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was steady despite falling NYMEX futures. Dealers said signs of improving inland demand, coupled with limited supply, were supporting prices.</p>
<p>More arbitrage trade from northwest Europe, which has seen another three or four cargoes sold to transatlantic destinations in the past two days, has also underpinned the market.</p>
<p>Low octane barrels were heard available and one dealer said these would be appropriate for blending purposes.  </p>
<p>Gas oil was quiet, but slightly firmer in line with NWE, as traders awaited the results of a 600,000-tonne Greek tender due by Thursday. The tender is for delivery from October to March and dealers said Greece may award up to one million tonnes to minimise the risk of a shortfall in deliveries.</p>
<p>They were also waiting for the results of a 45,000-tonne Turkish tender, also due for release on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spot prices were valued at $2.50-3.00 premium to benchmark quotes for 0.2 percent sulphur heating oil, while 0.05 percent premiums were at $1.00-$1.50.  </p>
<p>The fuel oil market was slow with little discernable encouragement from the latest Portuguese tender for five cargoes. Traders said they had not seen any interest to meet the requirement as yet and hence prices looked flat around $107-108 fob Med.</p>
<p>Interest for good quality bunker spec has eased following a number of deals earlier in the week.</p>
<p>An M-40 cargo loading now in the Black Sea was finding no buyers at an offer price of formula +$2-3. &quot;It's a 50 kt cargo, so it's less attractive to bunker buyers looking for 25 kt,&quot; said one Med trader. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 8145</p>
