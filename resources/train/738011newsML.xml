<p>Swiss food and beverage conglomerate Nestle SA said on Thursday the growth rate for group sales would likely ease in the second half of the year compared with the first half due to the expected development of foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Nestle also said it was confident the internal growth rate would continue in the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>Nestle's net profit for 1997 is expected to evolve in line with group sales, the company added in its brief statement on business in the January to end-June period.  </p>
<p>Nestle's first half group sales rose 17.5 percent to 33.5 billion Swiss francs, but the depreciation of the Swiss franc accounted for nearly 11 percent of this sales increase.</p>
<p>The decline in the Swiss franc against major currencies in early 1996 had the effect of inflating the first half results of Nestle and other Swiss companies.</p>
<p>&quot;For 1997 as a whole, the Nestle Group remains confident that the favourable rate of internal growth will continue, Nestle said.</p>
<p>Excluding the impact of divestments, acquisitions and currency fluctuations, Nestle's internal growth amounted to 2.7 percent in the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;Consolidated sales should therefore also grow, albeit at a slower rate than during the first half of 1997, as a result of the expected foreign exchange evolution,&quot; it said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;As for consolidated net profit, Nestle expects it to evolve in line with consolidated sales.&quot;</p>
<p>Nestle added that it would publish a full half-year results, including a profit and loss statement and a balance sheet on September 18, after a board meeting.</p>
