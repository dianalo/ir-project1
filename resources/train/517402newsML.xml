<title>USA: Rep. Schumer to run for D'Amato's NY Senate seat.</title>
<headline>Rep. Schumer to run for D'Amato's NY Senate seat.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Democratic Representative Charles Schumer of New York said Thursday he would run for the Senate next year against three-term Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm excited about my choice because I know it's the right fit,&quot; Schumer, 46, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;New Yorkers need a senator who will fight for more high- paying jobs, for better schools, for lower electric rates, for tougher gun control, for lower health care costs and for a woman's right to choose. I intend to be that senator,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Schumer was first elected to the House in 1980 from Brooklyn. He is best known as one of the chief sponsors of the Brady bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period for handgun sales.</p>
<p>D'Amato, 59, was elected to the Senate in 1980 after defeating Republican incumbent Jacob Javits in a bitter primary and re-elected in 1986 and 1992. He is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and is often called &quot;Senator Pothole&quot; because of the effort he makes to deal with local issues.</p>
<p>Asked about Schumer's candidacy, D'Amato told reporters in Washington, &quot;Everybody has a right to run, even Chuck Schumer.&quot;</p>
<p>Several other New York Democrats including former D'Amato foe Mark Green and former Congresswoman and 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro are thought to be considering a bid for their party's nomination to oppose D'Amato.</p>
