<p>Key IMM currency futures finished lower as the dollar remained firm in afternoon trade.</p>
<p>September marks, Swiss francs and yen all ended down and not far from the day's lows after spending an afternoon of mostly quiet trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Currencies are looking relatively bearish and the trend is still there as far the downside,&quot; an IMM currency futures trading desk manager said. &quot;But I think we're in consolidative range trade into tomorrow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders noted a flurry of activity very late in the day, when a dealer bought 2,000 marks and sold 1,500 yen.  </p>
<p>Reaction to U.S. data this morning was muted.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.2 percent rate versus the downwardly revised 4.9 percent first quarter growth and compared with estimates for a 1.9 percent Q2 gain. The Q2 implicit deflator and the price index each grew at a 1.4 percent rate, the smallest quarterly increase in the two inflation gauges since the early 1960s.</p>
<p>The market was unmoved by a drop in the latest weekly U.S. jobless to 277,000 from 299,000. Economists had forecast a 306,000 level in claims.</p>
<p>Traders looked ahead to key U.S. data on Friday.  </p>
<p>The July U.S. jobs report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls grew 193,000 and the jobless rate slipped to 4.9 percent, with a 0.2 percent rise in hourly earnings.</p>
<p>Also on tap are June factory orders, July National Association of Purchasing Management data, final July University of Michigan consumer sentiment and two inflation gauges.</p>
<p>&quot;These numbers have to be overly aggressive&quot; for a reaction in currency futures, the desk manager said. &quot;So if we see like a 350,000, or 400,000 (payrolls number) then that would be bullish for a rate hike and help the dollar.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Anything that points to an interest rate hike will buoy the dollar, but if the bonds sell off sharply I think you'll see the dollar sell-off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Also this morning, the Chicago Purchasing Managers regional manufacturing index fell to 60.6 from June's 61.5. The employment index fell to 51.0 from June's 57.1, but prices paid rose to 61.6 from June's 53.7.</p>
<p>At the close, Sept yen down $0.000012 at $0.008481, marks lost $0.0013 to $0.5450, Swiss fell $0.0003 to $0.6638, pound up $0.0120 at $1.6372, Can dollar up $0.0014 at $0.7275, Aussie dollar up $0.0016 at 40.7467, Mex peso fell $0.000500 to $0.125600.</p>
