<headline>Slovenia's SKB to purchase 51 pct of UBK.</headline>

<p>Slovenia's second-largest bank SKB said on Thursday it would buy 51 percent of bank UBK, assuming majority ownership of the smaller bank on July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Our link-up will have a positive effect for both banks. It will reduce costs especially concerning investment in development,&quot; Ivan Nerad, chief executive of SKB told reporters at a news conference.</p>
<p>The two banks will form a new banking group around SKB, which plans to raise its share in the crowded Slovenian market to 16 percent by the year 2000 from the current 11.2 percent.</p>
<p>UBK has a share of less than one percent and is among the smallest of the tiny Alpine republic's 28 banks.</p>
<p>The merger, which still needs approval from the Bank of Slovenia and UBK's shareholders, would entail SKB taking control of investment and private banking, while UBK would remain active in the area of small business banking.</p>
<p>UBK said SKB would buy UBK's own portfolio in the value of 340 million tolars and a new share issue in the value of 160 million tolars. The banks did not reveal the purchase price.</p>
<p>SKB's net profit in 1996 rose to 1.79 billion tolars from 713 million, while balance sheet assets were up to 208.3 billion tolars from 178.6 billion.</p>
<p>UBK's profit slumped to 2.1 million tolars from 124.1 million, while its balance sheet fell to 13.2 billion from 13.9 billion. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana newsroom +386 61 125 8439</p>
