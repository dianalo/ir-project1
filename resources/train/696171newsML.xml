<p>Japanese experts, struggling to explain how a teenager could be responsible for the grisly murder of an 11-year-old boy, have pointed the finger at violence in the media and light penalties for juvenile crime.</p>
<p>The arrest at the weekend of a 14-year old boy as a suspect in the murder and mutilation of Jun Hase, 11, has triggered national hand-wringing about child violence and an outpouring of views from education and crime experts.</p>
<p>Most blamed the usual culprits in such cases -- breakdown of family values, a repressive education system and the proliferation of &quot;splatter&quot; movies and video games.</p>
<p>In the suspect's room, police found a stack of horror-movie videos and books on past murder cases, such as the U.S. serial killer of the 1960s nicknamed &quot;Zodiac Killer&quot;, whose letters to police were mimicked in a note the killer sent to the media.</p>
<p>Jun's severed head was found at the gate of the suspect's junior high school in the western port city of Kobe on May 27, three days after the young boy went missing. A note stuck in his mouth said the murderer was taking revenge against the education system.</p>
<p>Police have said that the two boys used to play together and that Jun's brother was among the suspect's schoolmates.</p>
<p>Many experts faulted the suspect's homeroom teacher, who reportedly ordered him to stop coming to school after he was blamed for a bloody fist fight with a classmate in February.</p>
<p>But others have focussed on the lack of a strong deterrent in Japan's law on juvenile crime.</p>
<p>Crimes by junior high students have been growing at an alarming pace, according to police statistics, although the figures are still low compared to some Western countries. Last year 36,787 junior high students were arrested for serious crimes such as assault and murder, a rise of 27 percent over the previous year.</p>
<p>Japanese compulsory education lasts nine years, six at elementary school and three at junior high school, with a strong emphasis on discipline and academic success.</p>
<p>Police sources have told the media that the suspect confessed that he killed Jun after experiencing &quot;irritation&quot; and an indiscriminate urge to kill someone, returning later to sever and retrieve the head.</p>
<p>If convicted, the 14-year old suspect, whose name cannot be released under Japanese law on juvenile crime, will face a maximum sentence of just two years at a juvenile correction centre for the killing.</p>
<p>This contrasts with penalties in other countries like Britain, which sentenced two 11-year-olds to 15 years in prison for the murder of toddler James Bulger in 1993.</p>
<p>The Bulger case, like the murder of Hase, caused national soul-searching about children's exposure to violence through mass media and how juvenile killers should be punished.</p>
<p>In Japan, a child under 15 who is charged with a serious crime is tried at a District Family Court. State prosecutors do not take part in the hearing and lawyers can represent the defendant.</p>
<p>Media reports quoting a teacher at the suspect's former school suggest the boy, the eldest of three children from a middle-class family, was aware of the country's lenient laws.</p>
<p>Two years ago when the suspect was 12 years old, he was caught by a teacher at his elementary school firing an air gun at toddlers at a local park.</p>
<p>When admonished, he was quoted by the teacher as saying &quot;Since I'm only a child, I wouldn't have to go to jail, would I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In retrospect, he might have had in mind killing somebody before junior high school graduation (at 15),&quot; the teacher told Japanese media.</p>
<p>Criminal psychologist Masaaki Noda said Japan has turned a blind eye to juvenile crime.</p>
<p>&quot;The background of this case is that adults have tried to hide away juvenile crime rather than face up to children who commit these crimes,&quot; Noda said.</p>
<p>&quot;Children are no longer the innocent creatures they used to be and so we must get rid of these light penalties.&quot;</p>
<p>Hiroshi Iikura, professor of criminal law at Nihon University, agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States, Britain and other countries are much stricter with youth. Criminal prosecution is allowed and the suspect's name is revealed. This case should open discussion on how we deal with juvenile crime,&quot; Iikura said.</p>
