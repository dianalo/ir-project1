<headline>U.S MUNICIPAL FOCUS - looking for modest jobs data.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds late Thursday were quoted from unchanged to off about one-quarter of a point as traders adjusted positions ahead of the payrolls data, which some hope will prove surprisingly mild.</p>
<p>Noting some estimates that predict the economy only added 175,000 jobs, a trader said &quot;There is a school of thought that expects it be a little lower.&quot;</p>
<p>A Reuters consensus survey of economists showed they look for a slightly smaller gain of around 166,000 jobs.  </p>
<p>But if the payrolls data, which are due out on Friday at 0830 EDT, show that the economy grew at a faster clip than such forecasts, the market could turn down sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be a big disappointment if this thing comes in with a two-handle,&quot; the trader said, referring to the possibility that the data might show the number of jobs climbed by more than 200,000.</p>
<p>In the previous month, August, payrolls increased by 250,000.  </p>
<p>And some traders said there seemed to be more than one interested buyer. &quot;There's definitely more than one that's going to be involved in this,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>A gauge of the secondary market's size, Standard &amp; Poor's Blue List, firmed to more than $1.2 billion from levels seen earlier this week.</p>
<p>December municipal bond futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade rose three ticks to 115-8/32, while December Treasury bond futures were unchanged at 110-10/32. As a result, the MOB spread between the two futures contracts strengthened a few ticks to plus 158.</p>
<p>The Reuters 10-year municipal general obligation bond index fell four basis points from last week to 5.06 percent from 5.10 percent.</p>
<p>In the seconary market, actively quoted issues included North Central Texas Health Facilities Development Revenues of June 2021, which carry a 5-1/2 percent coupon. The bids were at 5.82 percent NET, unchanged.</p>
<p>And Cook County Illinois Capital Improvement Original Issue Discount of November 2022, which pay a 5-7/8 percent coupon, were bid at 99-3/4, also unchanged.</p>
