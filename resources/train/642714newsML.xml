<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Friday proposed letting Russians decide whether to bury Vladimir Lenin, while parliament approved a union with Belarus, where Lenin fought much of his bitter war to establish Bolshevik rule.</p>
<p>On Russia's southern edge, four Russian journalists were released after three months of captivity in breakaway Chechnya, where local leaders have struggled to maintain law and order after fighting off a Russian military intervention in 1994-96.</p>
<p>In Moscow, the State Duma lower house of parliament voted almost unanimously to ratify a loose union between Russia and Belarus signed last month by Yeltsin and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
<p>Only two deputies voted against the proposal. Most Russians and Belarussians, nostalgic for the Soviet Union that collapsed in 1991, support integration moves between their two states.</p>
<p>The communist-dominated Duma will not give such a positive response to Yeltsin's latest initiative, however.</p>
<p>In St. Petersburg, Russia's second city, the president made a rare trip on home soil and proposed that voters should decide the fate of Lenin's embalmed body, which is still on display in his mausoleum alongside the Kremlin walls on Red Square.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope we will gradually rid Red Square of its status of a cemetery,&quot; Yeltsin told cultural leaders, saying a referendum could be held in the autumn.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has twice appeared on the verge of burying the communist founder of the Soviet Union -- in 1991 and 1993 -- but each time he let the matter slide.</p>
<p>On Friday he suggested &quot;removing the funereal bloom from Red Square...not with bulldozers or excavators but gradually and in a civilised way,&quot; Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our history. Let us give it a Christian character. A dead man should not be above earth. He should be buried in earth,&quot; Yeltsin said.</p>
<p>The president did not say what he wanted to do with dictator Josef Stalin and other Soviet luminaries interred in the Kremlin wall behind Lenin's tomb.</p>
<p>In a bid to stop Lenin's corpse from being removed, Yeltsin's foes in the Duma on Wednesday passed a law banning changes in Red Square's appearance.</p>
<p>The challenge to the Duma showed a Yeltsin in fighting form -- and one ready to joke about the health problems that sidelined him for the second half of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;They took my heart, pulled it out and put it back again. Now everything's okay,&quot; Yeltsin said, joking about the quintuple heart bypass operation he underwent in November.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm in good, sporting form. That's it. I'm working full strength. The bribe-takers' hands are already shaking,&quot; he told a small crowd who turned out to see him.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, four Russian journalists kidnapped in Chechnya arrived back in Moscow, looking pale but overjoyed to have won their freedom.</p>
<p>The men, one from Itar-Tass news agency and three from Radio Russia, were seized in the breakaway Caucasus region two months before Yeltsin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov signed a peace deal in May.</p>
<p>Kidnapping has become common in rebel Chechnya, where many men are still armed after the region's 21-month war.</p>
<p>A television crew from Russia's NTV commercial television is still being held, but Tass quoted Chechen security chief Lecha Khultigov as saying the three would be freed soon.</p>
