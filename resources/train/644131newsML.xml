<p>In Germany's latest battle against extremism and smut in cyberspace, a court on Friday put on hold a trial against a left-wing politician accused of aiding guerrilla acts with information linked to her home page.</p>
<p>In a case that could redefine the scope of Internet law, a Berlin court heard an hour of opening arguments in the trial of a former deputy leader of Germany's reform communist Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) before delaying proceedings until the end of the month so it could call expert witnesses.</p>
<p>Angela Marquardt, 25, caught the attention of Berlin prosecutors in January by allegedly directing users to an extremist publication detailing guerrilla tactics with a &quot;hyperlink&quot; from her Internet home page.</p>
<p>&quot;It has nothing to do with censorship,&quot; the public prosecutor said. &quot;Criminally relevant materials are subject to clafication by the district attorney or criminal prosecutors.&quot;</p>
<p>A hyperlink is a section of highlighted text on a page which can be viewed on the World Wide Web, the popular graphical part of the Internet computer network.</p>
<p>By clicking on the hyperlink with a computer mouse, the user is given immediate access to another computer across the Internet where the linked page has been stored.</p>
<p>The court's decision is likely to set a precedent on the issue of whether it is illegal for someone to lead users to Internet content that is &quot;suspect&quot;, even when those writings are not included in their own home page.</p>
<p>Marquart's Internet address offers a hyperlink to Radikal magazine, a publication banned from publishing an article in Germany with instructions on how to sabotage railways lines, a tactic of anti-nuclear protestors.</p>
<p>Although Radikal's Internet magazine stems from a computer in the Netherlands, prosecutors are attempting to make the case that Marquardt aided and abetted the original crime because her home page allows others access to Radikal.</p>
<p>Reflecting the new legal territory the case broaches, the court said it required expert testimony on the Internet, home pages and links in order to make an informed decision. The case will proceed again on June 30.</p>
<p>Marquardt, a blue-and-purple-haired activist who became a university student after leaving her post with the PDS, says she has distanced herself publically from violence as a political tactic and has called for the Internet to remain a forum for free speech.</p>
<p>&quot;Now when people talk about the Internet (in Germany), it immediately has to do with fascists or pornographers, but I think the Internet offers a little more than that,&quot; Marquardt told Info Radio.</p>
<p>Germany has captured international headlines with its aggressive attempts to stamp out child pornography, neo-Nazi propaganda and denials of the Holocaust -- all of which are illegal here -- from the Internet.</p>
<p>Bavarian authorities last month filed charges against the head of online service CompuServ Inc's Central European operations for aiding in the trafficking of child pornography, dissemination of Nazi symbols and violent computer games.</p>
