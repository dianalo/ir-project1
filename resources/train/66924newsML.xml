<p>The Mexican peso closed weaker across the board on Friday as foreign brokers stepped in to buy dollars ahead of possible rate hikes in the U.S. next week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign banks stepped in to sell large amounts of pesos which put the peso under great pressure, the more so as there were local dealers who had not covered their dollar positions yesterday,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 2.2 centavos weaker at 7.5490/7.5520 per dollar, and its 24-hour stablemate 3.1 centavos weaker at 7.5460/7.5500 per dollar.  </p>
<p>Traders said the peso was further weakened by some dealers who took advantage of the demand for dollars and bought greenbacks to make speculative gains on the day rather than to cover positions.</p>
<p>&quot;To be honest, part of the weakness was due to speculation. Some Mexican banks think they can manipulate the market, but it got out of hand, said a peso trader. &quot;In any case it's a fact that a lot of capital left the country today.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People will be nervous until the Fed meeting is over and done with,&quot; another trader said.</p>
