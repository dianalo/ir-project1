<title>VENEZUELA: Venezuela to close int'l airport runway for repair.</title>
<headline>Venezuela to close int'l airport runway for repair.</headline>
<dateline>CARACAS 1997-03-19</dateline>

<p>The main runway at Venezuela's main international airport will be shut for repairs for nine hours a day for 10 to 15 days from April 8, forcing wide-bodied aircraft to make alternative arrangements, a top airport official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The larger wide-bodied aircraft will have to make a sacrifice,&quot; Juan De Jesus Rivero, airport director at the Transport and Communications Ministry, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Rivero said that during repairs to the main runway the Simon Bolivar International Airport about 15 miles (25km) north of Caracas, a parallel auxiliary runway could be used.  </p>
<p>The auxiliary runway is 2,000 meters long, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;DC-9s, 727s and even up to DC-10s will be able to use the auxiliary runway,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Work would be carried out between 0600 local time/1000 GMT and 1500 local time/1900 GMT to minimize the duration of the repairs.</p>
<p>&quot;If we work during these hours, we estimate it will take between 10 and 15 days,&quot; Rivero said.</p>
<p>He added that airlines had been given sufficient warning to make allowances for the repairs which had already been held up for a month.  </p>
<p>&quot;The airlines knew about this more than 30 days ago. We could be willing to put it back up to five days more if the airlines need it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wide-bodied aircraft would have to use the main runway outside of the hours of repairs or make alternative arrangements, such as using the international airport in Valencia, 100 miles (160 km) west of Caracas.</p>
<p>Rivero said the runway repairs were urgently required since it had not had any maintenance since it was built more than 30 years ago.</p>
