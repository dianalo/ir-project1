<p>Resignation, mild criticism and a determination to soldier on marked the reaction by the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to being left out of NATO as they pondered their next steps to boost security.</p>
<p>The three small nations, independent from the former Soviet Union since 1991, are all desperate for NATO entry as they seek permanent protection in case Russia leaves the path of democracy and turns hostile again.</p>
<p>But as expected, the Madrid summit of NATO leaders invited only the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland into the alliance. The Baltic states were mentioned as aspiring members.</p>
<p>Their entry to the alliance was never seriously seen as possible due to strong Russian objections. Moscow sees the three nations as part of its security zone.</p>
<p>In the Soviet era, the Baltic states were the site of key forward air defence systems as well as naval bases.</p>
<p>Lithuania's Vytautas Landsbergis, who took on Moscow during the drive to independence and is now speaker of parliament, took exception to the fact that in the final summit declaration the three states were not mentioned by name but only as the Baltic region.</p>
<p>However, he broadly welcomed the summit's conclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;The declaration is a real step to the increased security of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,&quot; Landsbergis said in a statement.</p>
<p>Estonian daily Eesti Paevaleht took a similar line to Landsbergis.</p>
<p>&quot;The Baltic states, who were not named individually in the statement, could not have expected anything more from Madrid than the three country widening,&quot; it said in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;If expansion starts, it may contiune. And NATO stuck its head in the sand like an ostrich and did not mention the three countries, but only the Baltic region,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>A Latvian diplomat said his country was satisfied with Madrid, which he said would help prospects of entering NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;New members will help the Baltic states integrate into the alliance as well,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Despite the NATO rebuff, the Balts have several initiatives to boost security and quell their fears of Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S., seen as sympathetic to the Balts although currently unprepared to risk Russia's ire by allowing them into NATO, is currently working on a special charter with the Baltic states.</p>
<p>The charter is expected to be discussed during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on July 13.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. diplomat was quoted in Stockholm on Wednesday as saying the United States would not consider NATO enlargement complete or successful until the Baltic states were included.</p>
<p>U.S. ambassador to Sweden Thomas Siebert said in the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter: &quot;We will work with each of the three Baltic states to help them achieve their goal of becoming members of NATO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Nordic countries, which have taken the Baltic nations under their wing since the collapse of the former Soviet Union, are also working on an initiative.</p>
<p>Dubbed &quot;friends of the Balts&quot;, the initiative aims at boosting cooperation, security and efficiency of the armed forces. It may be agreed at a meeting of Nordic and Baltic foreign ministers in the autumn, diplomats said.</p>
