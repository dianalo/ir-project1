<p>Maltese Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami announced on Monday that general elections would be held on October 26, eight months before the expiry of his mandate.</p>
<p>Fenech Adami told a news conference he had advised President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici to dissolve parliament as from Monday.</p>
<p>Parliament was due to reconvene on Monday after the summer recess.</p>
<p>The Nationalist Party led by Fenech Adami has a three-seat majority in the 65-seat parliament. It has been in power since February 1987, applied for membership of the European Union in 1990 (corrects from 1989), and was returned to power in 1992 elections.</p>
<p>Elections had to be held by the end of June next year but have widely been expected earlier.</p>
<p>Unofficial campaigning has already started, with the opposition Labour Party, headed by Alfred Sant, on Monday being quoted as saying his party would provide &quot;a government for all the people&quot;.</p>
