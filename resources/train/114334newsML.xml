<p>Oil and gas exporter Qatar is set to become a wheat flour exporter next year, the chairman of Qatar Flour Mills Company said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We need an average of 400 tonnes a day for our domestic consumption and our plant production will go up to 600 tonnes a day from mid-1997,&quot; Sheikh Jaber bin Mohamed al-Thani told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll export the surplus production,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Qatar currently produces 200 tonnes of flour daily from wheat, bought mainly from Australia, and imports the rest of the country's daily requirement from other countries.</p>
<p>But a new plant due to be commissioned next month is expected to triple the output to 600 tonnes a day, Sheikh Jaber said.</p>
<p>The new 390 million Qatari riyal ($107.1 million) plant is set to go into production on November 15.</p>
<p>Sheikh Jaber said the Qatar Flour Mills' existing plant at Messai'eed, 50 km (30 miles) south of the capital Doha, which is currently shut down, would be recommissioned by the middle of next year.</p>
<p>He said Qatar Flour Mills was also building 64 new silos which would give the company an additional 60,000 tonne storage capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;All this will boost our profits significantly in the coming years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Qatar Flour Mills Company, whose shares are publicly traded on Qatar's unofficial stock market, reported a 15 million riyal profit last year.</p>
<p>Sheikh Jaber also said the company had decided to trim the price of two varieties of its wheat flour by two riyals to 70 and 67 riyals per 50-kg (110 lb) bag from Tuesday.  ($1=3.64 Qatari riyals)</p>
