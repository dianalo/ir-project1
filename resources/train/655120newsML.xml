<p>Hong Kong's people will not agitate for more democracy after Britain hands the territory over to China on July 1, Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew has predicted.</p>
<p>While there might be some who thought they could &quot;cock a snook&quot; or show contempt for China, their number would be few, the pro-government Straits Times newspaper on Wednesday quoted Lee as telling reporters in London.</p>
<p>China was too powerful to be influenced by Hong Kong calls for democracy, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't believe that the Hong Kong people understand that, then you don't understand Hong Kong,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee said observers should wait until expected partial elections were held next year before discussing prospects for democracy in Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's not waste time talking about democracy. There never was any democracy in Hong Kong in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>The Straits Times also quoted Lee as saying:</p>
<p>&quot;One year is a very long time in Hong Kong. Come the anniversary of Tiananmen next year, you'll see the People's Liberation Army, 10,000 of them, with their red flag with its five yellow stars.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were a Hongkonger I would think twice before I interfere in the political affairs of the mainland.&quot;</p>
<p>A vigil has been held in Hong Kong every year since June 4, 1989, when the PLA cracked down on pro-democracy student protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>About 55,000 people from all walks of life attended the commemoration last week, some fearing they might not be allowed to hold another vigil under Chinese rule.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong newspaper said on Wednesday that China intended to station about 6,000 troops in the territory after the handover, about the same level as the British garrison at its peak.</p>
<p>Lee was in London as part of a two-week European trip. Singapore's prime minister from 1959 through 1990, Lee remains in the government as senior minister.</p>
<p>Lee, a frequent critic of Western-style democracy, said last month Hong Kong should scrap democratic reforms as soon as the British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>He told Britain's Financial Times reforms introduced by British Governor Chris Patten breached the 1984 Sino-British agreement for the return of Hong Kong to China.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were (Hong Kong's future chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa), I would adopt laws and regulations in Hong Kong as they were pre-Patten,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the Chinese) are not going to let Hong Kong upset China politically,&quot; Lee was quoted as saying.</p>
