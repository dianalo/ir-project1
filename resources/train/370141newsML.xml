<headline>American Air, pilots in last-ditch contract talks.</headline>

<p>American Airlines and its pilots union opened last-ditch contract talks on Monday to try to avert a nationwide strike set for a minute after midnight Saturday (0500 GMT).</p>
<p>If no deal is struck, the pilots union has pledged to close down the carrier, the nation's second largest, carrying 200,000 passengers on 2,200 routes worldwide a day.</p>
<p>A strike would cost the carrier an estimated $1 billion a month. Last week, American said it was drawing $1 billion from an existing line of credit and had arranged to borrow another $1 billion under a new credit line if needed.</p>
<p>American (AMR.N) officials say that, in case of a strike, other airlines would accept American's tickets.</p>
<p>A key issue is pay -- the pilots want an increase of 11.5 percent over four years; American has offered 5 percent.</p>
<p>Another is American's plan to add jets to its regional carrier, American Eagle, and allow members of the Eagle union, the Air Lines Pilots Association, to fly them under its lower-pay contract.</p>
<p>American's pilots see that as an effort by American to use the lower-paid commuter pilots to fly routes and jets now being flown by its membership.</p>
<p>But American has said it needs to have the commuter jets flown by the lower-paid pilots to be competitive with its low-cost commuter rivals.</p>
<p>After the initial meeting of the two sides, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, which is participating in the talks, called the session &quot;businesslike, very serious.&quot; But he told reporters the first meeting was limited to procedural issues and the sides defining their positions.</p>
<p>Asked if he expected the talks to head toward an agreement on Thursday or Friday, Hipp said, &quot;We would like to get an agreement in the next couple of days.&quot; But he added that such a timetable would depend on the parties.</p>
<p>American President Donald Carty told reporters before the talks began that his negotiators were in Washington &quot;to make a deal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're here to get a deal also,&quot; said James Sovich, president of the 9,000-member Allied Pilots Association.</p>
<p>American's Chairman and CEO, Robert Crandall, speaking to a business group in Chicago on Monday night, said a strike by the pilots would be costly to the carrier in cash and customers.</p>
<p>The talks moved to Washington, with federal mediators taking part, after the union's rank-and-file pilots rejected a tentative agreement reached by their negotiators and the failure of reopened talks to resolve differences.</p>
<p>On Friday, members of the Senate Aviation subcommittee urged President Clinton to help mediate the dispute, but the White House indicated it would not step in unless asked by both sides.</p>
<p>In 1993, Clinton ended a five-day strike by American's flight attendants by persuading the airline to agree to binding abitration.</p>
<p>American has called for binding arbitration in the current dispute, now two years old, but the union rejected the idea. Sovich of the pilots' union has said he wanted a deal now and did not want to risk lengthy arbitration for a settlement.</p>
<p>Crandall said the airline hoped to achieve a settlement, but suggested that such negotiations involving labor-intensive companies like airlines ultimately needed mandatory arbitration as a way to resolve disputes.</p>
