<title>RUSSIA: IMF loan, budget news support Russian MinFins.</title>
<headline>IMF loan, budget news support Russian MinFins.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds were steady on firm support after the International Monetary Fund said it would resume lending to Russia and the Russian parliament approved the 1997 budget, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The IMF said on Friday it had approved the resumption of lending to Russia. It was expected to release a tranche of a $10 billion loan worth about $336 million soon.</p>
<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament passed the 1997 draft budget in a first reading on Sunday.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday December 14 and 15 were working days in Russia.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Dec 16		  Dec 15</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    83.70-84.00	   83.75-84.05</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    59.80-60.10	   59.85-60.15</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    41.80-42.10	   41.85-42.15</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    47.40-47.90	   47.80-48.10</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    35.45-35.75	   35.20-35.50</p>
<p>&quot;Prices edged up just a little bit. Usually they would have risen a big figure on such news,&quot; a Russian bank dealer said.</p>
<p>But dealers said thin trading ahead of forthcoming year-end holidays had softened the impact of the move. They added some foreign banks were taking profits in early trading at higher levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Over all, prices are higher now than they were on Friday. They are finding support at current levels,&quot; a London bank dealer said.</p>
