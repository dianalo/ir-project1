<p>Shares in Luxembourg steelmaker Arbed have plenty of room to move higher in the longer term with the benefits of economic recovery expected to begin to show through in the first half of 1997, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The share price should increase over the next few months -- it is cheaper than its European peers,&quot; said Isabelle Defranne, analyst at Mignon Hanart Declerck, calculating a price to 1996 cashflow ratio of 2.4 and a price to earnings ratio of 24.</p>
<p>However, the short-term share outlook was uncertain, with the company due to report first half 1996 earnings late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted group net current profit of between 400 and 800 million Luxembourg francs for the cyclical company.</p>
<p>Consolidating for the first time German unit  Stahlwerke Bremen, Arbed swung into the black in first half 1995 with a 4.6 billion Luxembourg franc consolidated net profit. In full year 1995 it made a 6.6 billion consolidated net profit and a group net profit of 3.7 billion francs.</p>
<p>Defranne said there had been no pick-up in flat steel prices in first half 1996 but there were signs of recovery in long products which should be the first to take advantage of the next economic rebound because construction was their main outlet.</p>
<p>Savings from Arbed's in-house reorganisation were also a reason for future optimism.</p>
<p>Olivier Heuschling, analyst at Banque Bruxelles Lambert, said he did not expect the group's Belgian and Luxembourg steel activities to show a particularly good first half performance, but this could be tempered by an encouraging contribution from distribution.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not expecting a definite improvement in results until next year,&quot; he added. Long product prices should improve in the fourth quarter and Arbed's 1996 results as a whole should benefit from the effects of a stronger dollar.</p>
<p>He said foreign analysts preferred Arbed stock to that of Belgian steelmaker Cockerill Sambre because the Luxembourg firm had a more diversified product mix and wider international exposure.</p>
<p>However, Cockerill stock remains supported by its dividend prospects.</p>
<p>Heuschling agreed Arbed shares were undervalued, with a price to book value ratio of about 60 percent, adding he had a target of 4,500 francs for the stock in 1997.</p>
<p>The stock was down 10 francs at 3,750 on the Brussels bourse at midsession on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After setting a closing peak of 5,190 francs two years ago, Arbed shares declined to 2,770 by November 1995. Since then it staged a slow rise overall - touching a 1996 high of 3,840 in June before relapsing to 3,230 a month later.</p>
