<p>U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) Tuesday reintroduced a bill to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act in a move to make it easier for holding companies to diversify into other businesses.</p>
<p>The bill would repeal the 60-year-old law, which regulators say is obsolete, 18 months after being approved by the president.</p>
<p>The law controls holding companies which have utilities in more than one state, and was designed to protect shareholders from subsidizing utilities' unprofitable ventures into unrelated businesses.</p>
<p>The eleven electric and three gas utilities that are registered holding companies want the law repealed so they can expand in the increasingly competitive energy and wires markets without having to seek approval from regulators.</p>
<p>The companies account for about $100 billion worth, or 20 percent, of all the electric utility assets owned by investor-owned utilities.</p>
<p>Independent power producers and consumer groups, however, do not want the law taken off the books until after states break up local electricity supply monopolies.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the PUHCA repeal bill exacerbates market power by prematurely unleashing registered utility giants before real competition has even a chance to develop,&quot; said the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates.</p>
<p>The Senate Banking Committee, which D'Amato chairs, easily passed a PUHCA repeal bill, but it never came up on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>On the House and Senate side, other lawmakers have proposed to wrap repeal of the holding company act into more sweeping bills to deregulate local power markets.</p>
