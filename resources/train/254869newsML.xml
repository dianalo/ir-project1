<p>Turkey's interior ministry said on Friday it had &quot;found&quot; dozens of people whose familes charged had disappeared and were probably killed by security forces for their political ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty-nine peole who were allegedly missing are not lost, they are just getting on with their daily life...82 people were not taken into detention at all and they are not registered in police records for any other reason,&quot; interior minister Meral Aksener said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement said 187 people allegedly went missing from June 1995 to June 1996, according to the Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) reports. Many of the disappeared are people linked with Kurdish activism.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year fight between Turkey's army and guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), seeking independence or autonomy from Turkey.</p>
<p>The interior ministry said 58 of the &quot;missing&quot; were jailed for crimes committed, three were on the run from police for various crimes, two were killed by members of the gangs they belonged to and three of them were continuing their activities in &quot;terrorist organisations&quot;.</p>
<p>But an official from IHD said the ministry had not passed on its findings to the association and said he doubted the figures.</p>
<p>&quot;If the ministry knows where they are why don't they tell us? We apply to all the relevant offices, from the police to the state security courts and there is no sign  of these people,&quot; IHD's Nazmi Gur, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The statement said the ministry had formed an office, opened 24 hours a day, for seeking out disappeared people.</p>
