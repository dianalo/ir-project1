<title>UK: LIFFE coffee firmer on trade, industry buying.</title>
<headline>LIFFE coffee firmer on trade, industry buying.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Robusta coffee futures resumed a gentle upward trend on Wednesday morning with nearby prices driven by trade and industry buying against a backdrop of perceived ample supply.</p>
<p>The September/November spread attracted steady interest, which boosted the overall turnover, moving to a discount of around $3 after standing at an $8 premium at the start of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said they were slightly surprised by the movement in the spread as more of a squeeze had been expected on spot September.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought it (Sept/Nov) was going to go the other way...but I wouldn't say it (the market) is moving in a dramatic fashion,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Some buying was also seen from London brokers acting for the European trade, market sources said.</p>
<p>At the midday break September was up $9 at $1,665 and November up $14 at $1,669. Volume reached 2,058 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the London market still had good availability of hedgeable robusta coffee.</p>
<p>Supply was ample due to coffees which did not re-grade under the exchange's new criteria, in effect from the July delivery period, they said.</p>
<p>But more liquidity was still needed in the further forwards to encourage higher volume from nearby October which could be rolled.</p>
