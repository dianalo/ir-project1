<p>European bonds bounced higher in early trade on Friday, after stumbling lower in the previous session on speculation that U.S. interest rates would soon be moving up, analysts said.</p>
<p>Remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday about the need to act pre-emptively to fight inflation lashed markets already fretting over U.S. rates policy, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The key thing is that T-bonds recovered a bit from when we went home last night,&quot; said Karl Haeling, head of futures and options for Germany at DMG Futures &amp; Options in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;Against that backdrop we've got a very oversold market and we're coming into the weekend so you've got some internal dynamics pushing for a little bit of correction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At 0852 GMT, June Bund futures on LIFFE were quoted at 100.12, up 44 basis points from Thursday, June gilts were up 13/32 at 109-11, and June BTP futures were up 0.64 at 125.75.</p>
<p>On the MATIF in Paris, June notionnel futures were up 0.64 at 127.96 from Thursday while June T-bond futures were up 6/32 at 108-27 in automated trade.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve holds its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and analysts said trade would be strained until then.</p>
<p>&quot;We're definitely going to be edgy,&quot; Haeling said. &quot;Maybe we could have another 3/4 point rally on the upside on the Bunds but it's going to be very difficult to get above the 101.00-30 area,&quot; he said, citing this week's highs as technical resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done good damage to the charts but most importantly we've done big damage to psychology here,&quot; he said. &quot;With the price action since Monday we've had people completely change their whole outlook (on U.S. rates).&quot;</p>
<p>Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International Europe added, &quot;Every man and his dog is now looking for a rate increase. If the Fed weren't to go next week now I think they would face a credibility problem. I think Greenspan and all the other members have marked the market's card with regard to a rate hike now.&quot;</p>
