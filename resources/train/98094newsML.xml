<p>The European Union and the former Soviet republic of Georgia signed an interim agreement on Saturday aimed at encouraging economic ties.</p>
<p>The document, the first overall trade agreement between the EU and Georgia, includes sections on trade in goods, intellectual property, and customs matters.</p>
<p>It reiterates principles on human rights and democracy contained in a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) signed in April between the EU and Georgia.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an important milestone on our road to European integration,&quot; President Eduard Shevardnadze said.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Irakli Menagarishvili signed the 10-page document with Sean Farrell, Irish representative of the EU's rotating presidency.</p>
<p>Francois Lamoureux, head of the 15-member EU delegation, said it had talks with the government on a 2 million Ecu ($2.5 million) assistance package designed to help Georgia prepare to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>He said it was vital for the small Caucasus country to join the WTO before strong trade links could develop with the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;We want Georgia to become a member of the WTO. Membership in the WTO will make Georgia a worthy economic partner for the members of the European Union,&quot; Lamoureux said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the delegation signed a similar agreement with Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Fokion Fotiadis, head of the EU's Transcaucasus, Central Asia and Mongolia department, said the delegation cancelled a trip to Armenia over &quot;security concerns&quot; in the wake of violence and political unrest after a controversial election there.</p>
<p>&quot;We have insufficient security gurantees in view of the present situation in Armenia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He declined to answer when asked if the decision not to go to Yerevan was a form of protest over last month's reelection of President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, which international observers said was marked by voting irregularities.</p>
<p>&quot;The chairman of our delegation has made the decision not to go there because of security matters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan sent tanks into the streets and arrested as many as 250 political opponents after violent clashes between protesters who alleged he rigged the September 22 election which gave him a second five-year term.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the irregularities may call into question his victory. ($1=.8012 Ecu)</p>
