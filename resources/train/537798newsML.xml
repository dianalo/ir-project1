<p>South Korea's Savoy Hotel has offered a tender to buy 25.3 percent of New Star Trading Co's shares, the Securities Supervisory Board said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The securities market watchdog said in a statement the Seoul-based hotel offered to buy 120,785 of New Star's shares for 62,500 won per share after receiving tenders May 6-26 through Ssangyong Investment and Securities.</p>
<p>The offer price is compared to the garment maker's share price in early Thursday trading at 60,000 won.</p>
<p>Savoy had earlier said it wanted to take over New Star.</p>
<p>If successful, it would be South Korea's first-ever hostile takeover of a listed company.</p>
<p>New Star's president and his family currently hold 29.26 percent of the company's shares, the largest single stake.  </p>
<p>Under South Korean securities regulations put into force on April 1, those who want to buy more than 25 percent of a company's shares are obliged to offer tenders to buy shares until their total stake exceeds 50 percent.</p>
<p>New Star has a paid-in capital of 2.3 billion won, compared with Savoy's 8.93 billion won, the statement said.</p>
