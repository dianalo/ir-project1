<p>London-based Prudential Portfolio Managers launched an asset management joint venture in Mauritius on Thursday with the acquisition of a 35 percent stake in Mauritius Asset Management Company (MAMCO), officials said.</p>
<p>Officials of fund managing subsidiary of State Bank of Mauritius said the shareholding of MAMCO, previously wholly owned by State Bank, was also extended to state-owned State Insurance Coporation of Mauritius (SICOM) which acquired a 30 percent stake in the fund managing concern.</p>
<p>It said State Bank would retain a 35 percent stake.</p>
<p>They did not disclose what the deals were worth.</p>
<p>&quot;The joint venture with Prudential Portfolio Managers and SICOM constitutes, for State Bank, an important breakthrough by giving it a useful transfer of know how in the domain of asset management,&quot; a State Bank official said.</p>
<p>&quot;State Bank thinks that the joint venture will considerably help its subsidiary MAMCO in deepening its portfolio and fund management abilities and in establishing international norms,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>MAMCO was created in 1996 and currently manages the Mauritian Republic Fund which has an authorised capital of 550 million rupees ($27.3 million).</p>
<p>It is contemplating launching a regional fund which will invest in the Indian Ocean region.</p>
<p>&quot;MAMCO is working on the development of an Indian Ocean Rim Fund which will selectively invest in the stock exchanges of countries in the Indian Ocean Rim Area for Regional Co-operation (IOR-ARC) zone,&quot; the State Bank official said.</p>
<p>The IOR-ARC was formally launched in early March when delegates from 14 states gathered in Mauritius to adopt the charter of the new association. Members are Australia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Yemen.</p>
<p>Prudential Portfolio Managers manage 350 funds with assets amounting to some $156 billion and has a workforce of 1,100 employees, according to State Bank officials.</p>
<p>($1=20.1315 Mauritian rupees).</p>
