<p>Defending PGA champion Mark Brooks knows that scores may soar at Winged Foot so he will be happy to take par and move on in the season's last major championship starting on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's six hard holes, six really hard holes and six impossible holes,&quot; said Brooks, who won last year's PGA at Valhalla in a playoff after shooting 11-under over 72 holes.</p>
<p>&quot;Par's going to be a great score at the end of the week. If you're even par with nine holes to play you're going to be right in the middle of this golf tournament.&quot;</p>
<p>Respect for the classic course crowded with mature trees towering over narrow, rough-lined fairways leading to small, fast, elevated greens wavy with undulations and slope is universal among leading players in the 150-man field.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everybody is real excited about playing Winged Foot,&quot; said Tom Kite, appearing in his 24th PGA Championship.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a tremendous golf course, a fantastic test. Of course everybody is talking about how hard it is. But it is a wonderful test, straightforward and right in front of you.&quot;</p>
<p>Accurate driving is seen as a key, but that's only the first step to success.</p>
<p>Landing in the fairways gives you a fighting chance to deal with the beguiling greens on the 6,987-yard, par-70 layout tucked into a swank suburb just 45 minutes drive from the centre of Manhattan.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a demanding driving course and then the greens are probably the smallest we see, especially the usable putting areas,&quot; said Nick Faldo, the triple Masters and British Open champion. &quot;They are the smallest targets of any major by a long way.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many greens that fall off or have very severe slopes that you've only got half or two-thirds of what you actually see that is going to keep the ball on it, or is going to be puttable.</p>
<p>&quot;And then when you get there, you've probably got a hump in between you and the pin.&quot;</p>
<p>Tiger Woods has been busy picking the brain of his swing coach Butch Harmon, who grew up playing Winged Foot, where his father was the club pro for some 30-odd years.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been an unbelievable break for me,&quot; said Woods, who a year ago was preparing to win his third successive U.S. Amateur crown.</p>
<p>&quot;He's helped me on the greens, especially telling me things that only locals would know,&quot; said Woods, who said he was also busy learning about deceptive wind conditions and other local knowledge he hopes comes will bring him an edge.</p>
<p>Giving Woods an edge hardly seems fair as the 21-year-old and fellow young lions Justin Leonard and Ernie Els angle to complete a sweep of the season's Grand Slams for the under-30 set -- a feat unprecedented since the Masters joined the major championship list in 1934.</p>
<p>Kite acknowledged golf's new wave of players.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what you're seeing in golf right now is a shift. You go back five years ago and a lot of articles were being written about how the tour was suffering because you had to be in your high 30s or your 40s to win golf tournaments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And now all of a sudden, we have 20-year-olds winning golf tournaments. So it's just kind of a little cycle we're in.&quot;</p>
<p>Woods suggested it was the natural order of things.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was growing up and watching on TV, I used to see Watson, Wadkins, Kite all these guys playing really well. And every 10 or 15 years you're going to see a new generation of players coming out. And before then it was Arnold and Jack.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just the way it goes. When you get older, obviously your skills are going to start to diminish. That's just Father Time taking over.&quot;</p>
<p>Hale Irwin knows how tough the going can get at Winged Foot, and wouldn't mind showing the young breed how a cagey old veteran can still work the ball.</p>
<p>Irwin won the first of his three U.S. Opens at Winged Foot in 1974, on a course set-up that many considered one of the hardest ever established for a major. &quot;That was the benchmark for or should I say the mother of all golf courses that week.&quot;</p>
<p>The 52-year-old Irwin, who has been dominating the Senior Tour, won what became known as &quot;the Massacre at Winged Foot&quot; with a seven over par total.</p>
<p>Now with some of the lesser known young turks struggling heading into their final weekend to make the U.S. Ryder Cup team led by captain Kite, Irwin has even been mentioned as a dark horse contender for the squad.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I playing well now? Yes. Did I play well today? Yes. Do I feel capable? Yes,&quot; said Irwin, who played a practice round with Kite on Tuesday. &quot;Will he? Has he even considered it? I doubt it.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, I'd have to win this golf tournament.&quot;</p>
