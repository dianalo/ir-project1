<p>Philippine wheat importers are likely to buy more U.S. wheat in the coming week on prospects of softer prices, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for prices of U.S. spring wheat to drop to the $190 level per tonne compared to over $200 now,&quot; said an executive at a local flour mill.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Philippine mills had informed traders they would seek tenders to buy 35,000 tonnes U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>&quot;The mills decided to postpone a tender for next week to wait for prices to dip,&quot; said the flour mill executive who requested not to be named.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Philippine firms bought 25,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat at an average $4.64 per bushel FOB.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected U.S. wheat prices to soften next week due to talk that damage to the U.S. wheat crop due to floods and other weather problems early this month was less than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders had downgraded crop damage in the U.S. due to weather problems early this month to 50 million bushels as against earlier forecast of between 150 and 300 million bushels,&quot; said a senior Manila grains trader.</p>
<p>The market for rice, corn, soybean and soymeal is expected to remain quiet in the coming week due to ample supply.</p>
<p>On corn, hog raisers were awaiting government approval to their request that state-owned National Food Authority should import an additional 350,000 tonnes for animal feed, said one trader.</p>
