<title>AUSTRALIA: PRESSURED AUSTRALIAN DLR REMAINS NEAR TWO YEAR LOW.</title>

<p>The Australian dollar made a tentative but unconvincing recovery through the morning session from a two-year low reached overnight, and traders said the immediate risks were for further losses.</p>
<p>Continuing uncertainty over whether or not the rate easing cycle had come to an end meant there were plenty of sellers into any rally, and the dollar was not being done any favours by ongoing weakness in the New Zealand dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>By noon (0200 GMT) the Australian dollar had edged to US$0.7307/12 from an early US$0.7304/09.  </p>
<p>While just above its overnight low of US$0.7295 -- its lowest level since July 1995 -- the dollar was well below its Thursday close of US$0.7355/60, and the lack of a substantial bounce was seen as evidence the bias remained to the downside.</p>
<p>&quot;The Aussie dollar's not finding a lot of friends these days on the fundamental side of things,&quot; National Australia bank head of institutional sales in Singapore, John Noonan, said on Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;The interest rate differential is already favouring the U.S. -- another further widening of that would be very, very disheartening for the Aussie bulls,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Support was expected at US$0.7300, but a break of that level could see the unit targeting US$0.7200 in the near term.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that we're probably susceptible to go to around, technically, US$0.7150-7200 but I think from that level the reasons will come up to buy the Aussie dollar,&quot; Noonan said, and there were others who shared his view.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's ample scope for the Aussie to fall another figure or maybe more,&quot; Westpac technical analyst Peter Pontikas said.</p>
<p>The dollar was also unable to reclaim overnight losses on the cross rates.  </p>
<p>It was trading at 86.55/65 yen at noon, almost level with its open but down on Thursday's local close of 87.20/30. In trade weighted terms the dollar was steady through the morning at 57.6, after dropping overnight from Thursday's 58.0 close.</p>
<p>For Pontikas, the ongoing weakness in the New Zealand dollar, which has fallen around four cents since late June to its midday level of US$0.6362/67, was also a contributing factor in the Australian dollar's troubles.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Kiwi is imploding there's no reason to buy a related currency like the Aussie dollar,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>There were positives for the dollar -- such as ongoing fiscal consolidation and an improving ratings outlook -- but the rates question was the immediate focus.</p>
<p>As such, that meant that until the market was convinced that Australia had seen its last interest rate easing, the dollar would remain vulnerable to the downside and find rallies difficult to sustain.</p>
