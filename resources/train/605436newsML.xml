<p>Apple Computer Inc., looking for ways to focus resources on its Macintosh products, said Thursday it will set up a separate company to develop and sell the Newton handheld computer and related products.</p>
<p>The new company, tentatively named Newton Inc., will be owned by Apple and Newton employees, Apple said. The company, which aims to become profitable within a year, also could seek outside investors or go public, said Sandy Benett, Newton's chief operating officer.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that we will succeed as a separate entity,&quot; Benett said. &quot;We already have compelling products that are exceeding our targets; we have future products in development and I think we can succeed in markets outside of Apple's.&quot;</p>
<p>The Newton is a computer the size of a VCR tape that lets executives store phone numbers and addresses, send e-mail and write short notes.</p>
<p>The first versions of the Newton, introduced in 1993, did not sell well because they did not work well. In recent months, Apple has beefed up its software, made it more powerful and turned one version of the Newton into a popular portable computer for kids, dubbed the eMate 300.</p>
<p>A separate company focusing on the Newton could improve the product's prospects, analysts said. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., also could focus its scarce development money and talent on Macintosh computers and software.</p>
<p>To date, Apple has not disclosed how many Newtons it has sold, nor how much profit -- if any -- it has made. The product is better off under a separate company, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The way I look at it, even if Apple does hit a home run with the Newton, it's a little-league home run in a big-league ball park,&quot; said Richard Zwetchkenbaum, analyst at market research International Data Corp.</p>
<p>The Newton company will be headed temporarily by Benett. Apple is looking for a permanent chief executive. The company also will elect a board of directors separate from Apple's. About 200 employees will join the company, Benett said.</p>
<p>The Newton company will focus on gearing its products toward doctors, sales people and other mobile professionals -- markets where the Newton has sold best. Apple will retain the eMate 300, which has been a hit in education markets, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect significant growth and profitability of the Newton business in the first year,&quot; said Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Other financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Apple has sought investments from other companies into the Newton, but none has been found yet.</p>
<p>For the past 18 months, Apple has been cutting costs and dumping unprofitable products. The company's executives had been reluctant to discontinue the Newton because the product has gathered a small, but vocal, following.</p>
<p>Apple's stock fell 25 cents to $16.625 on Nasdaq.</p>
