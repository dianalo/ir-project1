<p>Kuwait, which controls about 10 percent of the world's oil reserves, said on Saturday it does not plan to expand a deal with U.S.-based Chevron Corp beyond an existing cooperation accord.</p>
<p>Kuwait Oil Company's (KOC) Ahmad al-Arbeed also told the official Kuwait News Agency that talks were going on with France's Total SA for a technical assistance deal similar to those with Chevron and British Petroleum Plc.</p>
<p>The Total talks involve the southern al-Wafra oilfield, which has a production capacity of about 120,000 barrels per day (bpd). OPEC member Kuwait has a quota of two million bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;International oil firms always aspire to secure other accords that would enable them to invest in Kuwaiti fields,&quot; Arbeed told the agency.</p>
<p>But no global giants have been shortlisted for such a move &quot;because no decision has been taken yet to develop ties&quot; beyond technical assistance accords, he added.</p>
<p>KUNA reported that state-owned KOC, in charge of production from the Gulf Arab state's fields, &quot;has no intention to develop its technical assistance accord with Chevron. The issue is still under consideration and study by decision-making authorities.&quot;</p>
<p>Chevron's 1994 accord with KOC expires next February while BP's agreement was extended by three years in 1996.</p>
<p>Arbeed said KOC &quot;is currently negotiating with Total to sign a new technical assistance accord...The aim of this is to study the latest technology in the world and pick the best to develop (Kuwait's) oilfields.&quot;</p>
<p>Chevron officials in Kuwait and other Western oil industry executives had expressed a wish to develop ties with KOC beyond technical assistance accords.</p>
<p>Industry sources say that Kuwait was considering possibly opening up the strategic, state-controlled oil sector to allow some form of direct foreign involvement in production to help meet a target of raising capacity to 3.5 million bpd by 2005 from a current 2.5 million.</p>
<p>Arbeed said KOC &quot;is focusing on studying contractual formulae to allow Kuwait the best investment of its natural resources and at the same time offer the foreign investor an appropriate financial gain&quot;.</p>
