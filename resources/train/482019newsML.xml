<p>Treating a rectal cancer tumour with radiation before an operation may improve the chances of survival, a team of Swedish doctors concluded in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>A group led by Dr. Lars Pahlman of the University of Uppsala randomly chose whether or not to give 1,168 patients one week's worth of radiation just before their rectal cancer surgery.</p>
<p>They discovered that while 27 percent of the volunteers who only had surgery developed a recurrence of the cancer within five years, the recurrence rate was only 11 percent for the patients who got the surgery immediately after their tumours were treated with radiation.</p>
<p>The nine-year cancer survival rate was 74 percent in the patients who got the radiation, compared with 65 percent among those who did not.</p>
<p>But the findings may not immediately change the way doctors treat rectal cancer, which strikes about 38,000 Americans each year and kills about 7,800.</p>
<p>In an editorial in the Journal, Dr. Bruce Minsky of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York said the Swedish study needed to be confirmed because nine other studies &quot;have not found a survival benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>Minsky said it may be better to delay the surgery until about five weeks after radiation treatments to give the patient time to heal from the side effects of the irradiation and allow the tumour to shrink.</p>
<p>&quot;An intensive, short course of radiation therapy does not provide these benefits, since surgery (in the Swedish study) is performed only one week after the completion of radiation therapy,&quot; Minsky said.</p>
<p>Doctors in the U.S. and Europe have long treated rectal cancer differently, according to Minsky.</p>
<p>European physicians often give radiation first before surgery. U.S. doctors often given it after surgery, along with chemotherapy, he said.</p>
