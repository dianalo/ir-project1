<p>A senior official of Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Friday he hopes the Bank of Japan's current low interest rate policy will continue a bit longer, given the situation at Japanese financial instititions.  </p>
<p>Asked about the consequences of a possible rise in Japan's official discount rate, the official told reporters:</p>
<p>&quot;I should not comment. However, looking the financial institutions' situation, I hope that the current (interest rate) situation will continue a bit longer.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Japan's interest rate policy was a matter for the Bank of Japan and that the bank's current easy monetary policy was being carried out due to economic conditions and not to help financial institutions deal with their problem loans.  </p>
<p>The ministry said earlier that problem loans at Japan's deposit-taking financial institutions, including small credit unions and agricultural financial firms, totalled 27.90 trillion yen as of the end of March.</p>
<p>Problem loans include bad loans to bankrupt firms, non-performing loans on which interest payments are in arrears of six months or more and loans being restructured.</p>
<p>Problem loans yet to be covered at the financial institutions were estimated at 4.69 trillion yen, MOF said in a statement.</p>
<p>The central bank has kept Japan's official discount rate -- that at which it lends to commercial banks -- at a record-low 0.5 percent since September 1995.</p>
