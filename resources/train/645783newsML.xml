<p>Tough new regulations on importing compact disc production lines are aimed at curbing widespread copyright piracy, the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday.</p>
<p>From June 1, anyone wanting to import a compact disc production line must have a licence, according to the regulation issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC) and the General Administration of Customs.</p>
<p>MOFTEC's Quota and Licence Administrative Bureau was responsible for approving licences, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The rule is the latest action by Beijing to try to curb piracy of intellectual property rights, a problem that brought China to the brink of a multi-billion trade war with the United States in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>Application procedures for the licences will differ for domestic and foreign-funded firms, but all companies must obtain permission from the State Press and Publication Administration before ordering equipment, the Business Weekly said.</p>
<p>&quot;After years of battling copyright piracy and obscene publications, we feel it is more urgent to crack down on the illegal plants than solely purifying the distribution markets,&quot; the newspaper quoted an official in southern Guangdong province as saying.</p>
<p>Guangdong has been the site of most pirate plants, but late last year closed more than a dozen illegal video compact disc production lines in a drive to meet the terms of agreements with the United States that averted the trade war.</p>
<p>Foreign copyright experts have long complained that Beijing was cracking down only on retailers and was not tackling the producers of the pirated goods, many of them operating with protection from local officials or the military.</p>
<p>Introduction of the latest regulations was expected to cut significantly the number of pirated and pornographic audiovisual products in China, the newspaper quoted industry experts as saying.</p>
<p>The regulation also affects chemical fertilisers and carbonated drinks, the newspaper said, adding that the regulation required companies to have licences for the import of 35 products. It gave no more details.</p>
