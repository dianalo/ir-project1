<p>Owens Corning on Wednesday said it expected its planned $515 million acquisition of Fibreboard Corp to add $0.05 per share to its 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>Owens spokesman William Hamilton said the transaction would propel the insulation, roofing and window company into the growing vinyl siding business. Although Owens entered vinyl siding two years ago, the revenues of its operation are extremely small.</p>
<p>&quot;It's tough to break into the business,&quot; Hamilton said, noting that Fibreboard owns some 130 distribution centers.  </p>
<p>Hamilton also confirmed the company told analysts in a conference call that it expected the transaction to add $0.20 to $0.25 to earnings per share next year.</p>
<p>Owens earlier said it would buy Fibreboard for $55 per share in a deal worth $600 million, including debt assumption.</p>
<p>Shares of Fibreboard shot up 6-13/16 to 54-5/16 by early afternoon. Owens Corning stock gained 7/8 to 42.</p>
<p>Hamilton said Fibreboard chief operating officer Ronald Mathewson will run the business and report to Jerry Weinstein, president of Owens' specialty and foam products division. Fibreboard chairman John Roach will serve as a consultant.  </p>
<p>Owens did not specify the amount of cost savings expected from the transaction.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll get some scale benefits, but mainly the big thing here is adding this product to our manufacturing base. This shows the market we're serious,&quot; Hamilton said.</p>
<p>Fibreboard is one of the five largest U.S. producers of vinyl siding.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it's very good (for Owens) in the long term,&quot; said Donald Pattison, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>The planned transaction represents a change in strategy for Fibreboard, which had expected a series of acquisitions in its core building prodiucts business this year after selling its ski resorts division in late 1996.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it completed the $120 million purchase of privately held Fabwell Inc in a transaction that was expected to increase Fibreboard's annual revenues by 40 percent.</p>
