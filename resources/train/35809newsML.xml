<p>Entergy Corp's nuclear generated electricity is competitive and it can be competitive in a deregulated marketplace, chief nuclear officer Donald C. Hintz told security analysts Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In Entergy's nuclear organization, we are controlling costs -- and producing power at costs that are competitive with other energy sources -- not just with other nuclear plants,&quot; Hintz said.</p>
<p>The good performance of Entergy's nuclear plants has positioned Energy to market its services as a manager of nuclear plants to other utility companies, Hintz said.  </p>
<p>He noted Entergy signed a memorandum of understanding on July 31 to explore managing two New York Power Authority plants.</p>
<p>&quot;Additionally, over the summer, three other nuclear utilities have expressed their interest in talking with Entergy about the future of the nuclear power business and the various scenarios that might evolve,&quot; Hintz said.  </p>
<p>Entergy will also expand its &quot;geographic footprint&quot; by offering new services, using its competencies to finance long-term investments; and design, build and maintain distribution networks, John A. Brayman, executive vice president - business development, told the group.</p>
<p>Opportunities are being targeted in four general areas: energy management, illumination, and space conditioning; telecommunications and information services; broadband communications; and security and alarm monitoring, he said.</p>
<p>Wednesday the company announced a tentative agreement to acquire National Security Service, a security monitoring company.</p>
<p>Through investment in domestic and overseas power projects, Entergy has acquired a net ownership of an additional 1,300 megawatts of generating capacity and interests in distribution and transmission systems serving 1.4 million additional customers, the company pointed out.</p>
