<headline>United Dental slammed by earnings forecast.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-27</dateline>

<p>Shares of United Dental Care Inc dropped nearly 37 percent after the managed dental care company said its second-quarter results will fall short of analysts' estimates due to a substantial loss on a Medicaid contract and high claims.</p>
<p>United Dental lost 8-3/4 to 15-3/4 and was among the most-heavily traded Nasdaq issues by late morning on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After the market closed on Friday, United Dental said it is unable to determine how the company's second quarter results will fare. The company said it is reviewing appropriate accounting adjustments, including charges.  </p>
<p>On a consensus basis, analysts expect United Dental to earn $0.33 a share in the second quarter, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown downgraded United Dental to market perform from buy.  </p>
<p>Southcoast Capital analyst Anne Reese said she downgraded United Dental to short-term hold from strong buy, and trimmed the long-term rating to buy from strong buy.</p>
<p>&quot;We cut the short-term rating due to limited visibility on earnings for this quarter ... but we kep the long-term rating as a buy on our belief in their long-term earnings prospects. They provide a service that is need and demanded in the marketplace,&quot; Reese said.</p>
<p>Reese said she may reevaluate the ratings after the company provides more guidance on its second quarter earnings prospects.</p>
<p>Dallas-based United Dental operates prepaid and indemnity dental health care plans.</p>
