<p>President Bill Clinton's national security adviser urged British loyalists in Northern Ireland on Tuesday not to be provoked to violence by a bomb attack on British Army headquarters there.</p>
<p>&quot;We join all who care about Northern Ireland's future in calling on the loyalists not to be provoked into a futile and deadly spiral of violence by yesterday's attack,&quot; said White House adviser Anthony Lake, who has been central to Clinton's efforts to further peace in the province. &quot;It could destroy the future of Northern Ireland,&quot; Lake said.  </p>
<p>In a speech at Georgetown University, Lake said the double car bomb attack at British Army barracks in Lisburn near Belfast, in which 20 soldiers and 11 civilians were hurt, was &quot;despicable&quot; and &quot;an outrageous act of terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>The attack has been claimed by a shadowy Irish republican group, the Continuity Army Council, although some British officials believe the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland, was responsible.</p>
<p>Lake said the attack &quot;deserves the strongest possible condemnation by civiized men and women everywhere.&quot; He added: &quot;Those responsible must be brought to justice and as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Lake said it would be a tragedy if the loyalists, who want to retain British rule, abandoned their own ceasefire. He said the Clinton administration, which has made settling the Northern Ireland conflict a top priority and is helping mediate peace talks, would do all it could to keep the peace process on track.</p>
