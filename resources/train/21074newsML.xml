<p>Shares in Rolls-Royce fell 2.6 percent on Thursday as the aircraft engine maker disappointed with an unchanged interim dividend following a first-half loss due to one-off charges.</p>
<p>The loss and the charges, which were related to Rolls-Royce's withdrawal from the loss-making large steam power generation business, were as expected.</p>
<p>But analysts were disheartened that the dividend was left at two pence per share, prompting them to cut their full-year dividend forecasts.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce earlier reported a first-half loss of 169 million pounds ($263.6 million) compared with a 70 million pound profit a year ago, due to exceptional charges of 248 million to cover withdrawal from large steam power generation.</p>
<p>The company said the current provisions had prevented it to raise the pay-out.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce shares dropped six pence to 225-1/2, but industry watchers see little further downward potential in the short-term ahead of next week's Farnborough airshow.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd expect to see, particularly over Farnborough, some good order announcements which might help the shares in the short-term,&quot; said analyst Nick Cunningham at broker BZW.</p>
<p>But an order worth up to $450 million from Egypt's Kato Group to power a batch of Russian-built aircraft failed to lift sentiment on Thursday. &quot;The dividend is clearly disappointing,&quot; said analyst Paul Pickford.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, however, was cautiously upbeat about future prospects as the civil aircraft market was picking up and spares sales were rising.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate outlook is steady and, with the introduction of new products over the next few years, the company is confident of achieving future growth,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>First-half results showed the underlying strength of its aerospace group, the company added.</p>
<p>&quot;Our decision to withdraw from large steam power generation recognises the need to focus upon those businesses where we have established or can establish leading market positions,&quot; chairman Sir Ralph Robins said.</p>
<p>The main growth for Rolls-Royce is in civil aircraft engine orders, but Robins said it is too early yet to make firm predictions on prospects in this market segment.</p>
<p>&quot;The airlines have had many years of lossmaking and now they are in the second year of making profits, so I am slightly cautious how long this improvement continues,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is no doubt there is much more activity than there was last year,&quot; Robins added, while speaking on engine orders for civil aircraft in the first-half of 1996.</p>
<p>The company recently secured orders for planes to be used by a host of Asian flag carriers such as Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways International and Cathay Pacific.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce's sales from continuing operations rose to 1.77 billion pounds from 1.49 billion pound.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of activity in the civil business. We are seeing growth everywhere,&quot; Robins said. &quot;We are negotiating with airlines throughout the world for our whole range of products.&quot;</p>
<p>Robins said spares orders for engines had continued to increase in the first-half as airlines have begun to re-stock after a long period in which they ran down their stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;We may be seeing around 10 percent (spares order growth),&quot; he said.</p>
