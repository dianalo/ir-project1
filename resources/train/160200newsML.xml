<p>Bond that would give international investors the right to subscribe to equity offerings of companies to be privatized are being considered by the Moroccan government.</p>
<p>&quot;The bond is a hybrid of a fixed income instrument and equity,&quot; said Abderrahmane Saaidi, Minister of Privatization of Morocco, in a press briefing on Thursday.</p>
<p>The minimum size of the issue would be $200 million to $300 million, he said.  </p>
<p>The idea of issuing an international privatization bond came from the success of domestic privatization bonds -- the first tranche of which, issued in January, has appreciated by 15 percent on the secondary market, the minister said.</p>
<p>Two tranches of domestic privatization bonds were issued this year in the form of zero coupon bonds, which give bond holders the priority to subscribe for initial public offerings of soon-to-be-privatized state enterprises but yield two percentage points less than the prevailing domestic interest rate.  </p>
<p>The fast clip of foreign direct investment is expected to reach $700 million this year, up from $400 million in 1995, the minister said, adding that while French investors still make up 20 percent of the total volume, &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; investors form the fastest growing group in direct investment.</p>
<p>A bumper crop harvest this year should enable Morocco's gross domestic product to rise by 10 to 11 percent, compared with last year drought-striken decline of seven percent, the minister said.  </p>
<p>In light of those positive developments, the minister said Morocco is also considering tapping the straight Eurobond market and interested in having its sovereign credit rated.</p>
<p>Joyce Chang, emerging markets debt strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the idea of an international privatization bond has not flown well among foreign investors.</p>
<p>The success of the domestic offering would not readily translate to an international offering, she said. &quot;Foreign investors do not look at the 'right to buy' the same way as domestic investors.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the segmentation of global investors, fixed income money managers are not attracted to the return of the proposed bond, which is pegged to the rather low domestic interest rate.  Equity investors, on the other hand, are more comfortable going directly to the stock market, Chang said.</p>
<p>&quot;And there is concern for currency risk,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the innovative idea of international privatization bonds shows Morocco is committed to and making good progress in privatization, Chang said.  &quot;Starting only in 1993, it has done well (in privatization) compared to some countries like Brazil,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Given the economic recovery and increasing foreign investment in the country, Merrill has recommended overweighting Morocco in the international portfolio, Chang said.</p>
