<p>Peter Cronshaw, who has presided over Genbel South Africa's successful unbundling this year, said he is broadly optimistic about the country's macro-economic outlook but still sees no floor for the crumbling rand.</p>
<p>In an interview before a presentation to London shareholders who form 26 percent of Genbel SA investors, CEO Cronshaw said he was &quot;not as ragingly optimistic as this time last year&quot;, partly because of the rand's 25 percent plunge in the last year. It hit an all-time low of 4.6515 to the dollar today.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no chance the rand can be a stable or even balanced currency until foreign exchange controls are abolished. I can't see the floor before then,&quot; he added, declining to estimate a date for the scrapping of controls.</p>
<p>The 600 million rand investment trust, which in the year to end-June returned 69 percent to investors against the JSE All Share Index of 30 percent, has restructured (unbundled) in the past sixmonths, aiming to realise more shareholder value.</p>
<p>It distributed 93 percent of the company's share portfolio, bringing it down to &quot;a more manageable size&quot; and reducing the discount from 22 percent to around 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not taken undue risks either,&quot; said Cronshaw. &quot;We have just been in the right stocks.&quot; He said Genbel SA's rand hedge was its holding of the Swiss luxury goods stock Richemont and some other stock with foreign revenue.</p>
<p>The unbundling also resulted in the listing in May of Genbel Securities in Johannesburg. It traded initially at 22.50/share and is now at 35.00, entirely on domestic demand, Cronshaw said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was massive demand prior to unbundling and then some profit-taking. Interest has now turned up again.&quot; Genbel Securities is also Genbel SA's heaviest weighting, both by market value and percent of portfolio. Among the fund's other key holdings are NSA Investments, Dimension Data, Persetel, Investec Group, Servgro and Malbak, which announced its own unbundling on Monday.</p>
<p>Among major developments for Genbel in the coming year are plans to apply for a banking license and the introduction of a SharePlan to tap retail potential.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision on the banking license will be taken in the next two weeks and any application will be through in under a year,&quot; Cronshaw said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment there are certain disadvantages because we are outside the banking spread,&quot; he noted. &quot;That is sometimes expensive and can even add to risk. A banking capability would complement our operations very well.&quot;</p>
<p>On the SharePlan he said most financial houses were targeting the same constituency of white male earners over 35, but Genbel had found huge interest in low-entry flexible savings plans among black single parent (mostly feamle) households.</p>
<p>&quot;There are an estimated six million Post Office savings accounts with around 120 rand in them,&quot; Cronshaw noted. Although South Africa's official savings rate is very low (at five percent against a target norm of 17 percent) he believes that much unofficial saving is not captured by the statistics.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not big money individually but it is an interesting vein for the future,&quot; he added. &quot;We have had a very good response in just two months and are looking more for customers some way down the track.&quot;</p>
<p>Cronshaw will also address investors in Brussels next week.</p>
<p>In London he found &quot;not as buoyant a mood about South Africa as a year ago&quot; but said he was trying to pass on &quot;important signs coming through in South Africa regarding infrastructure developments and privatisations&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The telecom company is looking for a partner and there is a lot of infrastructure financing being arranged right now -- we are looking at that ourselves,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said other reasons for caution on South Africa were persistant crime, which although &quot;past its worst&quot; was still a major deterrant to investors, and the brain drain of skilled personnel from the country.</p>
