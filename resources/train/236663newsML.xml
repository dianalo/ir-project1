<p>Polish shares rebounded after a three-day fall but analysts said the stronger selling after price-fixing signalled a fall on Friday and that the market was still in its month-long sideways trend.</p>
<p>&quot;The market could slip a little tomorrow...but we can still say we're in a horizontal trend and that there's no reason for the trend to change,&quot; said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital &amp; Investment.</p>
<p>Some analysts said a relatively busy public-offering schedule later this month gave reason to believe the market could fall slightly before year-end.  </p>
<p>Others said there was a chance money could stay with listed shares as recent bourse debuts have proved modest.</p>
<p>&quot;People may be leaving that (the primary) market because profits there after bourse debuts have been relatively stable,&quot; said Krzysztof Zawila, an analyst at Penetrator brokerage.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index rose 0.8 percent to 13,634.6 and turnover was stable at 77.5 million zlotys on both markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors would be watching food prices for the last 10 days in November, due on Friday, to help determine November's inflation figure due later in the month.  </p>
<p>Analysts said top gainer Optimus, up 7.4 percent in active trade, may have been helped by recent buy recommendations and the approaching holiday season, when computer sales should rise.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover was at 6.1 million zlotys with four stocks down and two up.</p>
<p>NFI units eased 0.4 percent to 139 zloltys in a 12.5-million-zloty turnover in the regular bourse session and fell 3.5 percent to 136 zlotys in 11.1-million-zloty continuous trade.</p>
