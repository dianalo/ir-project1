<headline>Indian call easy on low demand, gilts sharply up.</headline>

<text>
<p>Indian call money rates ended Friday unchanged from the day's opening on poor demand at 0.10-0.50 percent in lacklustre trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Stray deals also took place at 1.0 percent, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Call market was very bad today...rates were below 0.50 percent almost throughout,&quot; a dealer at a state-run bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's repo auction is unlikely to have any impact on call rates, even if Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mops up 30-35 billion rupees,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Call rates should be between 2.0 percent and 3.0 percent for the rest of this fortnight,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The RBI accpeted bids for 15.20 billion rupees at a four-day repo auction of government securities held on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is keenly awaiting steps in the forthcoming credit policy to bring down interest rates and boost credit off-take without fuelling inflation,&quot; R. Narayan dealer at Bank of Nova Scotia said.</p>
<p>The RBI announces its credit and monetary policy for the first half of 1997/98 (April-March) on April 15.</p>
<p>Narayan said the government securities market was in the grip of a bull run which resulted in prices of stocks of all maturities rising by 20 to 40 paise.</p>
<p>Ten-year paper traded on Friday at a yield of 13.30 to 13.35 percent compared to last week's 13.65 percent, he said.</p>
<p>Friday's trades on the National Stock Exchange were worth 5.02 billion rupees against Thursday's 6.07 billion rupees, dealers said.</p>
<p>Treasury bills maturing in July traded at a yield of 8.05 percent yield against its last yield of 8.15 percent, dealers said.</p>
