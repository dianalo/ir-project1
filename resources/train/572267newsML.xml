<headline>KL shares end flat, despite foreign buying.</headline>

<p>Malaysian shares closed almost unchanged on Friday, even though some foreign institutions began showing interest in selected blue-chip stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Composite Index closed 0.23 of a point higher at 1,107.37 on a lack of local buying interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been selling of stale long positions, but on the whole it has generally been totally unexciting today,&quot; said Tony Shue, an institutional dealer at Jupiter Securities.  </p>
<p>&quot;There has been some interest in better quality stocks. We have had requests from some dealers in London for gaming stocks,&quot; said Fiona Leong, head of research at JM Sassoon.</p>
<p>News of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's two-month sabbatical was a reflection of his confidence in his grip on power locally, analysts said.</p>
<p>Volume remained thin, with 226 million shares traded valued at 1.633 billion ringgit. -- Azhar Sukri (603 206 2323)</p>
