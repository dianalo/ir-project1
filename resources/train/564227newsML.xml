<p>Swedish insurer Skandia managed to buck negative trends in non-life insurance by showing a higher operating profit for non-life and reinsurance when releasing first quarter earnings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Operating profit for non-life insurance and reinsurance rose to 1.13 billion crowns from 794 million in the year earlier quarter, boosted by the Skandia Norden unit's performance, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The first quarter was characterised by continued fierce competition in the non-life insurance and reinsurance areas,&quot; chief executive Lars-Eric Petersson said in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Much to our satisfaction, despite this, our technical result improved by 20 percent (to 483 million crowns) on a rolling 12-month basis.&quot;</p>
<p>Life and unit linked assurance kept going strong with operating profit rising to 518 million crowns from 318 million, mainly lifted by advances in the U.S. and Sweden.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in life and unit linked assurance is strong, at the same time as Skandia is entering new markets,&quot; Petersson said. &quot;Profitability continues to be very satisfactory throughout this segment.&quot;</p>
<p>Total operating profit jumped 61 percent to 1.48 billion crowns and total premiums rose 27 percent to 18.59 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Premiums in non-life insurance and reinsurance slipped to 6.97 billion crowns from 6.99 billion, while premiums in life and unit linked assurance surged to 11.62 billion crowns from 7.69 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in written (life and unit linked assurance) premium remained strong in the first quarter in the U.S., at 54 percent, and in Sweden, where the increase was 62 percent,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;During the last 12-month period Skandia's market share in the U.S. variable annuities market has risen from 3.0 percent to 3.8 percent -- a growth rate that is faster than the largest competitors'.&quot;</p>
<p>On a rolling 12-month basis, earnings per share rose to 14 crowns from 11 and net asset value per share increased to 181 crowns from 174.</p>
<p>Assets under management increased by 15 percent to 169 billion crowns in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Skandia's return on investments was lifted by higher share prices with the yield on the equity portfolio rising to 9.1 percent from 8.0 percent.</p>
<p>The total yield on investments, calculated at current value, increased to 2.9 percent from 2.5 percent and investment assets rose by three billion crowns to 50.9 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Investment income during the quarter was high and despite unease in the stock markets around the world, a continued positive trend was noted through April,&quot; Petersson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Work on discontinuing the direct insurance activities in the U.S. and the restructuring of the Italian operations are proceeding according to plan,&quot; he added.</p>
