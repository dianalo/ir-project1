<p>The threat of more currency turmoil is likely to remain a powerful impediment to further near-term investment in southeast Asia, British fund managers say.</p>
<p>This week's $16 billion rescue loan package for Thailand from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Asian nations was an important first step towards stability -- but investors say markets are still too volatile for comfort.</p>
<p>The Thai baht firmed slightly on Wednesday, but the fall of the Indonesian rupiah to historic lows and persistent signs of weakness in the Malaysian ringgit left money managers reluctant to put cash on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to pick targets in a market with this much currency volatility,&quot; said Edward Goodchild, a fund manager at Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets.</p>
<p>He is not a Thai stock buyer now.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the beginning of a transformation process and there is a lot more pain to come. We can't yet estimate the price on anything.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem feeds upon itself, fund managers say, as a lack of confidence in Thailand's economic system leads to capital flight.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is a capital flow problem rather than a fundamental economic problem, to a point. Foreign money is no longer coming in and is maybe even getting out, if it is hedge fund money,&quot; said Simon Nicholson, who has $3 billion in the region for Gartmore Investment Management.</p>
<p>&quot;Thailand we still think is not attractive in general, or in the financials and property companies in specific,&quot; he said, adding that he is running a book that is underweight in most southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>Goodchild is eager to see details of the IMF agreement with Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't yet seen the measures that the IMF are going to insist upon...It's not so much the money that's important, it's the price the Thais will have to pay for it.&quot;</p>
<p>Financial markets will be looking for an aggressive programme that improves transparency in the financial system and reforms the bankruptcy code, he said.</p>
<p>James Anderson, who manages about $500 million in the region for Ivory &amp; Sime, is positive on Thailand but says several things need to fall into place before prices can rise.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as the currency market nervousness goes away we will begin to see the currency market at a level that is appropriate for domestic policy. Then we will see falling interest rates, which will be good for shares.</p>
<p>&quot;In the long term it will be very positive,&quot; he said, adding that by no longer trying to track the dollar the Thais will be able to use monetary policy to stimulate their economy.</p>
<p>But if confidence in Thailand is not established, he says, South East Asia could be in for another round of currency shocks.</p>
<p>Gartmore's Nicholson is looking to much the same scenario for the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the currencies settle down and interest rates can fall a bit, the Asian ratings are pretty cheap, or at least cheaper than Europe and the U.S. But it may be another year.&quot;</p>
