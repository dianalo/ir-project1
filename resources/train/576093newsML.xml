<p>President Bill Clinton cast away his crutches on Monday and used a walking cane as he began the next phase of recovery from surgery on his right knee two months ago.</p>
<p>The president stepped gingerly down the steps from Air Force One leaning on a single cane in his left hand as he arrived back at Andrews Air Force Base from a week-long trip to Mexico, Costa Rica and Barbados.</p>
<p>With wife Hillary at his side, Clinton walked from the aircraft to his waiting Marine One helicopter for the flight to the White House. He walked with his injured right leg stiff, but appeared to be putting only minimal weight on the cane.</p>
<p>He had used the cane as well to climb the steps of his airplane when he departed Barbados earlier on Monday.</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn said earlier the president had conferred with his doctors and his physical therapist as well as Mrs. Clinton on Sunday at poolside to discuss his condition.</p>
<p>Clinton used one of a pair of hand-carved, wooden canes given to him at the San Francisco monastery in Tlaxcala, Mexico, last week. He took a few steps with them when he received them and the canes had since been outfitted with rubber tips.</p>
<p>The cane's shaft has the Mexican symbol of an eagle with a snake in its mouth. The curved handle is a panther.</p>
<p>Clinton tore a tendon in his right knee during a stumble at the Florida estate of golfer Greg Norman in the early hours of March 14. He underwent surgery the same day to repair it.</p>
<p>The president has suffered back pain in recent days and Glynn said doctors believed the crutches might have been a cause.</p>
<p>During his weekend in Barbados, Clinton got into the swimming pool for some physical therapy at the Heron Bay estate where he stayed. He set a grueling pace during the longest foreign trip he has taken since hurting the knee, but Glynn said one day of rest at poolside did much to rejuvenate him.</p>
<p>He still has several more months of rehabilitation before he can take up his favourite sports, jogging and golfing, again.</p>
