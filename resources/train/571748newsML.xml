<p>Albania's interim Prime Minister Bashkim Fino will start a five-day official visit to the United States on Saturday to discuss his country's crisis and the holding of early elections in June, a government spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>Jorgji Kote said Fino would leave on Saturday, stopping off in Rome to meet Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and discuss Albania's political stalemate ahead of the election.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Fino will meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday. He will leave on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This was an invitation from Ms Albright but many other congressmen have expressed their interest to discuss with him Albania's main political problems, the restoration of order and the holding of the early elections,&quot; Kote said.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit itself is a sign of U.S. government support for the Albania's National Reconciliation Government.&quot;</p>
<p>Fino will be back in Tirana by May 15 or 16 when parliament will discuss the new electoral law that is hoped will allow an election targeted for June 29 to proceed.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Fino, accompanied by Finance Minister Arben Malaj, would also meet officials from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to discuss economic assistance and an international conference on Albania's economy.</p>
<p>Albania's nine-party National Reconciliation Government was appointed on March 9 after the Democratic Party government resigned amid violent chaos across the country.</p>
<p>Albanians angered at the loss of savings in collapsed savings schemes took to the streets to demand President Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party resign for not regulating the high-risk funds.</p>
<p>The interim government was appointed by Berisha to stop the slide into anarchy and the opposition Socialists agreed to join the government as long as fresh elections were called.</p>
