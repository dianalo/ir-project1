<headline>Domestic supply fears drive new U.S. wheat rally.</headline>

<p>A surprise surge in U.S. wheat futures on Wednesday shows that the industry is once again fretting over the availability of wheat.</p>
<p>But this time, fears are not based as much on tight world stocks as they are on tight U.S. milling supplies.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, hard red winter wheat for December delivery in Kansas City shot up 16-1/4 cents to close at $4.40-3/4 -- its highest level in a month. Similar price moves were seen in Chicago and Minneapolis wheat markets.</p>
<p>Some traders said concerns about the domestic availability of wheat fueled the rally. Some said the rally came as players tried to roll short positions out to the next delivery month. Some said both reasons were valid and fed on each other.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a domestic premium situation,&quot; said Dave Armstrong, grain analyst at Chicago Corp. &quot;We have to rally U.S. (values) versus the world in order to shut off export sales because we literally don't have the wheat to sell. We have to get U.S. wheat prices up where we...get our millers covered.&quot;  </p>
<p>Wheat traders in Kansas City and Chicago said many growers in the U.S. Plains missed the chance to sell wheat last spring, when concerns about world supplies caused prices to soar to all-time highs above $7.00 per bushel.</p>
<p>Subsequent huge crops in Europe and the Southern Hemisphere pushed world prices lower. But many U.S. growers have stubbornly held on to supplies, planning to sell only when prices to return to their earlier highs.</p>
<p>&quot;The domestic wheat supplies are pretty tight. Throughout the fall, farmer movement has been light,&quot; said Skip Searcy, wheat trading specialist for Chicago-based trade house FIMAT Futures.</p>
<p>Ironically, Wednesday's price move came days after Egypt snubbed U.S. wheat in favor of wheat from Argentina, Australia and France. Egypt's decision to buy 600,000 tonnes of wheat -- none of it from the United States -- provoked cries that U.S. wheat was overvalued relative to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Rest of the world, perhaps; domestically, perhaps not.</p>
<p>Evidence of a perceived tight availability of nearby stocks was seen in the widening of the inverted spread between December and March contracts in all three U.S. markets.  </p>
<p>The KCBT December/March spread widened Wednesday to close at 38-1/4 cents. It traded late Tuesday at 33 cents. The last time the KCBT nearby spread closed higher than 38 cents was on April 25, 1996, when it closed at 48-1/2 cents.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a day later, KCBT wheat set an all-time high at $7.44.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some analysts explained Wednesday's rally as the result of large-scale short covering prompted by nervousness over a firming of world wheat values.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't really have a particularly good answer, other than everybody is short,&quot; said Charlie Sernatinger, vice president of Chicago grain sales for E D &amp; F Man International.</p>
<p>&quot;The commercials are short both futures and world wheat. The funds are clearly short, according to the last traders' commitment report. That leaves...a few light domestic consumers that are long the market and maybe a few small speculators,&quot; Sernatinger said. &quot;They all started covering at the same time and there was just no one to sell it.</p>
