<title>UK: Coconut oil not seen hit by Philippine peso change.</title>
<headline>Coconut oil not seen hit by Philippine peso change.</headline>

<p>News that the Philippines Central Bank is to allow the peso to move in a wider range against the U.S. dollar is expected to have only a limited impact on coconut oil prices in Europe, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a bit of a seven day wonder, but if the prices move at all they will soon find their level again,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The move should make coconut oil cheaper, but any increase in demand would soon push the price back up again.</p>
<p>&quot;Sellers could try and increase the price on the local market to bring it make to where is was in dollar terms, or we could see an increase in demand on the international market. But whatever happens the effect would be the same with prices staying more or less where they are in Rotterdam,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people say it could be bullish, others bearish - it all depends as usual on whether you're talking to a long or a short. But whatever happens it's going to take a few days to sort out,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Early indications put coconut oil offers in Europe at around $615 a tonne across the board on Friday against $607.50 to $620 a tonne at Thursday's close. --Jim Ballantyne, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 8062</p>
