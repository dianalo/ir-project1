<title>HONG KONG: &quot;Highland Furies&quot; last British regiment in HK.</title>
<headline>&quot;Highland Furies&quot; last British regiment in HK.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Scottish regiment chosen to represent the departing British at the ceremonies marking the handover of Hong Kong arrived in the British colony on Thursday for a historic 138-day tour of duty.</p>
<p>The pipes and drums of the Black Watch, nicknamed the &quot;Highland Furies&quot; by the French, will sound the end of more than 150 years of British colonial rule on June 30, 1997 when Hong Kong reverts to China.</p>
<p>Their tour won't be all spit and polish and ceremonial parades.</p>
<p>They will also assist the Hong Kong police with anti-smuggling patrols, conduct border observation duties and help guard key installations.</p>
<p>&quot;However their most high profile role will be as ceremonial troops during the handover ceremonies in June,&quot; a garrison spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Many of the 511 soldiers of the Black Watch, whose Latin motto means &quot;Nobody provokes me without being hurt&quot;, are no strangers to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Black Watch was the resident infantry battalion of the Hong Kong Garrison from January 1993 until August 1994.</p>
<p>The Black Watch was formed in 1725 as a result of the Scottish Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 to oversee the warring Highland clans.</p>
<p>The force wore a tartan so dark it was almost black and as their role was to &quot;watch&quot; over the Highlands, it was dubbed &quot;Am Freiceadan Dubh&quot; in Gaelic which translates as the &quot;Black Watch&quot;.</p>
<p>The French gave them another nickname after the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 -- the Highland Furies.</p>
<p>Since the end of World War Two the regiment has served in Korea, Kenya and Cyprus and has conducted 11 tours of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>British naval, airforce and specialists from other regiments will also be assigned to Hong Kong until the handover.</p>
