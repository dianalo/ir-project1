<p>London is extending its lead as the centre for broker research into continental European equities, the 1997 Reuters survey of European larger company investment research, sales and trading showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out by Tempest Consultants Ltd, showed London-based brokers took 83 percent of top three industry and country sector positions, up from 80 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg Securities and Goldman Sachs International retained their top spots, as fund managers and company finance directors respectively voted the firms as best for overall research.</p>
<p>Fund management groups voted SBC Warburg as offering the best research, with 10.29 percent of the vote against 11.92 percent last year.</p>
<p>Company finance directors, as last year, voted Goldman Sachs best for broker research, with 9.87 percent of the vote, up from 8.15 percent last time.</p>
<p>In other awards, Fidelity Investments was voted best fund management group according to finance directors, and they also voted Fidelity best individual fund manager.</p>
<p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury William Waldegrave, presenting the awards, used the occasion to trumpet the strengths of the City of London financial centre, and said he had no problem with most of the highly-rated companies being overseas houses, such as the U.S. investment banks with European operations based in London.</p>
<p>The City contributed some 20 billion pounds in overseas earnings in 1995, three percent of gross domestic product, Waldegrave said.</p>
<p>Conceding that it was &quot;increasingly unlikely&quot; that Britain would be a founder member of a single European currency in 1999, Waldegrave said he was confident London could &quot;rise to the challenge of being in or out of EMU&quot;.</p>
<p>The survey showed companies were increasing their contact with fund management groups more than with brokers' analysts. Finance directors were also reading less broker research than last year.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was identified as the broker offering most improved European analysis and service, taking 19.86 percent of fund manager votes in this category.</p>
<p>Tempest said the survey also showed that the continental European equities marketplace was overbroked.</p>
<p>Less than 10 percent of the 2,219 analysts distributed around Europe's financial centres including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Milan, Paris and Stockholm were rated in the survey by both fund management groups and by listed companies. An elite had developed, with the top 100 analysts accounting for 43 percent of votes cast by fund managers.</p>
<p>The survey, which covered the 350 largest continental European listed companies, had response rates of some 75 percent of the companies and from fund managers handling some $240 billion of international institutional funds including those from some of the world's largest fund management groups.</p>
<p>Tempest said the pace of change in the market was quickening, with many of the traditional relationships between fund management groups, quoted companies and brokers being eroded.</p>
