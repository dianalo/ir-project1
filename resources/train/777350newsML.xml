<p>Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui plans to visit at least two Central American nations in September in his first overseas trip since a 1995 U.S. visit that infuriated arch-rival Beijing.</p>
<p>Foreign minister John Chang said on Monday Lee would visit El Salvador and possibly a Caribbean nation, in addition to a scheduled trip to Panama for a September 7-10 conference for users of the Panama Canal Zone.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Lee) will attend the Central American leaders' summit in El Salvador, and he might visit a Caribbean nation after his El Salvador trip,&quot; Chang said, adding that the entire trip would last two weeks.</p>
<p>Chang declined to say which Caribbean country Lee would visit but noted that Grenada is Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in the Caribbean where Taipei has an embassy.</p>
<p>Lee might also visit Paraguay in South America, he added.</p>
<p>Chang said Lee would transit in Hawaii to and from Central America. The U.S. State Department said on July 30 that it expected to issue a transit visa that would allow Lee to pass through Honolulu on September 4-5 and September 17-18.</p>
<p>Lee's September travels are seen by analysts as a bid to secure Taiwan's relations with its diplomatic allies amid increasing efforts by Beijing to choke the island's international ties.</p>
<p>Beijing has considered Taiwan a renegade province not entitled to foreign relations since the two sides split after a civil in 1949.</p>
<p>In 1995, Lee made a private but high-profile visit to the United States that enraged China and prompted it to launch months of war games and unarmed missile tests near Taiwan to warn the island against independence.</p>
<p>Taiwan has only 30 allies after more than four decades of diplomatic tussles with China. That number will fall to 29 in 1998 when South Africa, its largest ally, switches formal recognition to Beijing.</p>
