<headline>Finland Bank cuts key rate as ERM link nears.</headline>

<p>The Bank of Finland on Wednesday shaved 10 basis points off its key tender rate, a move which analysts said clearly demonstrated that Finland plans to link its currency, the markka, to Europe's stability mechanism.</p>
<p>Citing low inflation, interest rate convergence and confidence in the markka, the Bank trimmed its key tender rate to three percent, bringing it down by three full percentage points in a year, to equal the German Bundesbank's repo rate.</p>
<p>But the cut made no impression on foreign exchange markets, and analysts could see only one true motive -- to inhibit any further strengthening of the markka ahead of a widely expected link to Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in the waiting room, we are leaving the regime of a completely freely floating exchange rate behind and we are about to link to ERM,&quot; said Risto Murto, chief economist at brokerage Selin Finance.</p>
<p>The bank acted hours after Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto said it seemed likely that belonging to ERM was an unconditional criterion for joining the third stage of a single currency -- although his comments had made no impression on the markka.</p>
<p>&quot;The general opinion ... is that ERM is a system which one must join,&quot; Niinisto told a briefing for business executives and reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that belonging to ERM is unconditional,&quot; he said. &quot;It has become very probable that belonging to the Exchange Rate Mechanism will be an absolute criterion.&quot;</p>
<p>He repeated that the issue of linking the markka to the ERM &quot;will be decided this autumn&quot;, adding that the government had taken a slight risk in not joining ERM in time to have been in the system for the required two years.</p>
<p>Finland has long stated that it intends to be among the first to join Economic and Monetary Union, due to start in 1999; but some officials have argued that the currency has been stable enough outside ERM and may not need a formal link.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Bank of Finland (is) preparing the ERM linking and that's their role in this play,&quot; said Teijo Rantatupa, OKOBANK Treasury Economist; adding that he felt Wednesday's cut alone would not be enough to weaken the markka.</p>
<p>The markka, which remained steady after Wednesday's move, has for months been on a rising trend against the German mark -- contrary to Finland's competitive interest which would aim, if a peg were made, for this to be as the currency is weak.</p>
<p>Asked if he felt the cut would invite speculation about a markka-ERM link this weekend or soon, Rantatupa said the timing was irrelevant as markets were already expecting a link.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't matter when it takes place -- the market has discounted it for two to three weeks now. It doesn't matter when it happens,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Selin's Murto said the logic of braking the markka's rise meant a further independent Finnish key rate cut could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>&quot;With this logic ... it is not out of the question that the Finnish tender rate could, temporarily, go below the German repo rate,&quot; he said.</p>
