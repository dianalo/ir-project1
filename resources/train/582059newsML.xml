<title>ROMANIA: NATO-Russia deal must leave others free - Romania.</title>
<headline>NATO-Russia deal must leave others free - Romania.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania, nursing its longshot chances for early NATO membership, backed the agreement between the Alliance and Russia on Wednesday, but said other countries had to be free to choose their security strategies.</p>
<p>&quot;We have opposed the idea that NATO expansion is the expansion of a bloc, in the belief that a NATO-Russia deal is a must and should be a special partnership,&quot; Foreign Minister Adrian Severin told Romanian radio.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that today's agreement refers only to relations between NATO and Russia and not to the future of other countries, which must be free to make their own choices.&quot;</p>
<p>Romania has won the backing of Italy, France and Canada in bucking the odds and being included among the first ex-communist countries to be invited to join NATO at the Alliance's July summit in Madrid.</p>
<p>But the United States and Britain have given no such support and Germany has been only lukewarm. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are firm favourites for inclusion in the &quot;first wave&quot; of expansion.</p>
<p>Western governments have praised Romania's signature of a post-communist treaty with Hungary and welcomed the prospect of a similar pact being concluded next month with ex-Soviet Ukraine.</p>
