<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin was facing a seventh day in hospital with pneumonia on Wednesday as his political foes plotted his downfall.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's doctors said on Tuesday that the 65-year-old leader's condition was improving but his enemies in parliament, citing the president's repeated absences from the Kremlin, had started seeking ways to oust him on health grounds.</p>
<p>Viktor Ilyukhin, whose security committee urged the lower house to discuss removing Yeltsin, told commercial NTV television in an interview broadcast on Tuesday night that he only wanted legitimate presidential rule restored.</p>
<p>&quot;In the president's absence individuals appear who try to run the state...in the president's name. This is always fraught with the danger of revolutions or plots, or massive intrigues in general,&quot; said Ilyukhin, a senior member of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Ilyukhin's appeal will go to legal experts for consideration but is seen as having little chance of success.</p>
<p>Alexander Shokhin, deputy head of the State Duma lower house, told NTV that any impeachment attempt now would come to nothing as the president would be back in the Kremlin in two or three weeks and there would be &quot;nothing to discuss&quot;.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday that doctors had noticed a considerable improvement in Yeltsin, who has been in an elite Moscow hospital with pneumonia.</p>
<p>&quot;His (Yeltsin's) condition has improved considerably, he is more physically active,&quot; the presidential press service said. &quot;There is only sporadic wheeziness in his lungs.&quot;</p>
<p>The president, who turns 66 on February 1, also held 40 minutes of talks with the chief of his Kremlin staff, Anatoly Chubais -- the first meeting since he fell ill with anyone other than his doctors and family.</p>
<p>The doctors' report appeared to point to the biggest improvement in Yeltsin's condition since he was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital on January 8 with pneumonia which a top Kremlin doctor said affected both lungs.</p>
<p>But there was still no indication when the president, who had heart surgery on November 5 and did not return to work in the Kremlin until December 23, would leave hospital.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's ill health, particulary since he underwent a quintuple bypass operation two months ago, has led to accusations from political opponents that he is in no state to run the vast country of 150 million people.</p>
<p>Two presidential hopefuls, sacked national security adviser Alexander Lebed and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, have urged Yeltsin to step down. Other officials want changes in the constitution, which gives the president huge powers.</p>
<p>Ilyukhin led the security committee in calling on parliament to declare &quot;the premature cessation of Yeltsin's powers due to his persistent incapacity, through the state of his health, to carry out the duties of president of the Russian Federation&quot;.</p>
<p>The motion will be discussed by the Duma's legal department and then by party groups and could throw some light on the vague constitutional position on presidential illness.</p>
<p>The security committee said that, under the constitution, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin should stand in for three months while a new presidential election was organised.</p>
<p>Flamboyant ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic faction, offered his services instead.</p>
<p>&quot;The best thing the president could do, to protect himself, would be to appoint me prime minister. It would be an awe-inspiring step,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said in a statement that speculation about Yeltsin's health would come to nothing. It said the president had dismissed the need for constitutional changes.</p>
