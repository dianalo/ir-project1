<title>UK: Clockings pressure N.Sea Brent, other grades dip.</title>
<headline>Clockings pressure N.Sea Brent, other grades dip.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-07</dateline>

<p>The clocking of four out of five of the Brent cargoes nominated from the paper chains on Friday highlighted the North Sea crude market's supply overhang and signalled a further weakening of differentials, traders said.</p>
<p>Shell UK, Mobil, Koch and Glencore were each clocked with cargoes loading between March 22 and 26, while BP kept another Brent loading March 23-25, traders said.</p>
<p>A Brent loading March 18-20 earlier traded at April Brent -24 cents.</p>
<p>Run cuts at several major European refineries meant that unsold March North Sea barrels were piling up, traders said.</p>
<p>Brent cracking margins in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp refining centre are currently below $1 a barrel.</p>
<p>One trader estimated that seven million barrels of Brent and 19 million barrels of Norwegian crudes, including seven million barrels of Statfjord and six million barrels of Oseberg, were still unsold for March.</p>
<p>North Sea grades were already following Brent lower.</p>
<p>A Statfjord loading March 23-25 fetched just dated Brent +21 cents on Friday, over ten cents down on last reported deals.</p>
<p>A Beatrice loading April 10-15 was traded at dated Brent -25 cents, while a Gullfaks A was reported traded on Thursday at a much weaker dated Brent -15 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course if dated Brent continues to fall then we'll see differentials weaken right across the board,&quot; traders said.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs also fell, with next week's dates (March 10-14) traded at April Brent -30 cents. March 17-21 softened to May Brent +1/+3 cents.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads held fairly steady with April/May traded at +25, +27 and +28 cents. Outright April levels climbed in line with IPE which was up 34 cents at $20.04 a barrel at 1840 GMT.</p>
