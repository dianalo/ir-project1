<p>The Slovenian Chamber of Economy called on Wednesday for a liberalisation of direct foreign investment in Slovenia to make the small Alpine republic more competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;We lag behind our competitors concerning the amount of foreign investment. We will therefore press state authorities to introduce suitable legislation and to shift to active direct foreign investment policy,&quot; Cveto Stantic, deputy president of the Chamber, said at the meeting of its management board.</p>
<p>&quot;We support Slovenia's membership of the EU as soon as possible as that could significantly increase the country's attractiveness for direct foreign investment,&quot; Stantic added.</p>
<p>Slovenia signed an association agreement with the EU in June 1996 and hopes to be in the first group of countries that will extend the union.</p>
<p>Direct foreign investment in Slovenia in 1996 remained unchanged from the $176 million in 1995. According to the Chamber of Economy, total direct foreign investment in Slovenia so far reached $2.0 billion.</p>
<p>The Chamber expects foreign investment to increase as a result of the massive privatisation process and due to new laws on foreign currency transactions and mergers and acquisitions which would detail legislation on foreign investment. Both laws are in preparation and are expected to be passed by parliament later this year or in 1998.</p>
<p>The large-scale privatisation that started in 1994 and involves some 1,500 companies, is expected to be finished by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The process was based on voucher sales to employees and did not include foreign participation apart from some exceptional cases.</p>
<p>&quot;The relatively unfavourable economic situation of Slovenia shows the need for foreign investment which would also stimulate foreign trade,&quot; said Franjo Stiblar of the Economic Institute at Ljubljana University's Faculty of Law.</p>
<p>In 1996 Slovenia's GDP growth eased to 3.5 percent from 3.9 percent a year earlier, while inflation firmed to 8.8 percent from 8.6. Exports eased by 0.1 percent, while imports were down by one percent.</p>
<p>Major direct foreign investors in Slovenia are Austria, Croatia and Germany, followed by France, Spain and Italy.</p>
