<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index scored a record closing high on Monday, as the market took its lead from Friday's rise in U.S. stocks and bonds and investors continued to look for further gains in local share prices.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index closed 111.95 points higher at 12,330.35. The previous record close was set last Wednesday at 12,250.57.</p>
<p>&quot;It confirms a breakout,&quot; said Robin Hammond, Hong Kong research director at Asia Equity. &quot;Everything opened strongly. Futures opened at a premium which sucked the market up, with principally property stocks and banking stocks as the gainers.&quot;  </p>
<p>Monday's turnover was HK$6.93 billion, compared with HK$7.12 billion on Friday.</p>
<p>October Hang Seng futures finished 70 points higher at 12,318.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is just following the U.S. last Friday,&quot; said Edwin Cheung, dealing director at Taiwan Securities.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose 47.71 points on Friday to 5,969.38 and the U.S. long bond added 16/32 to yield 6.85 percent. The gains were prompted by a lower-than-expected rise of 0.2 percent in the U.S. September producer price index. Wall Street economists had expected a 0.3 percent rise.  </p>
<p>Traders said Monday's move was mainly concentrated on blue chip stocks. &quot;All of the effort is going into the index stocks. It's a bit premature for second liners. You have to have more of a run in the blue chips,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Hammond said share prices were likely to remain on their upward path in the short term. &quot;The move above 12,200 left a few people hoping to get the market to a cheaper level and that is not happening and there seems to be a lot of buying around. Hopefully 12,200 will begin to act as support for the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares in HSBC Holdings rose HK$2.00 to HK$149.50 and Hang Seng Bank advanced HK$2.50 to HK$90.25.  </p>
<p>In the property sector, Henderson Land rose HK$0.75 to HK$69.50 and Cheung Kong closed HK$0.50 higher at HK$61.00.</p>
<p>Shares in Hopewell Holdings Ltd continued to advance after the company announced a deal last week to sell a major part of its stake in Consolidation Electric Power Asia Ltd (CEPA) to Southern Electric International Inc. The stock rose HK$0.10 to HK$5.05. CEPA shares fell HK$0.05 to HK$17.90.</p>
<p>Transistor maker and distributor Honko International Holdings Ltd made its trading debut on Monday. The share ended at HK$1.04 compared with an issue price of HK$1.00 per share.</p>
