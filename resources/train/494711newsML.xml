<p>Billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, creator of an anti-European party dedicated to protecting Britain's sovereignty, began his election campaign on Tuesday by fishing for votes among disaffected trawlermen.</p>
<p>&quot;You have been sold down the river, the industry has been destroyed and they want to destroy it further,&quot; he told a small crowd of supporters on the quayside at Newlyn, a fishing port in Cornwall at the south-western tip of England.</p>
<p>Around 100 yellow and red flags of Goldsmith's Referendum Party fluttered from the large fleet of trawlers at anchor in Newlyn, where fishermen say European Union rules governing the size of catches are slowly killing off their livelihoods.</p>
<p>The Anglo-French businessman says he is prepared to sink 20 million pounds ($32 million) into his party, which accuses the ruling Conservatives of selling out to Brussels and wants a national referendum on Britain's future in the EU.</p>
<p>Goldsmith strode along the quayside followed by about 100 mainly elderly supporters before raising a flag on one of the trawlers. A large banner bearing the words &quot;Rule Britannia, not Brussels&quot; flew over the harbour in bright sunshine.</p>
<p>&quot;The EU has been built on stealth, it has been built on lies and it has been thoroughly destructive,&quot; said Goldsmith.</p>
<p>&quot;Forget a British fleet, forget the Cornish fleet, there will be an EU fleet in five years' time and to be able to go out and fish you're going to need a special fishing permit from a gruesome unelected bureaucrat in Brussels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A triumphant news release issued simultaneously in London said Goldsmith had been saluted by 100 trawlers' foghorns as he raised the flag, but in reality the only sounds apart from the wind and seagulls were a few cheers and polite applause.</p>
<p>The muted welcome in what should be a Referendum stronghold reinforced the impression given by opinion polls that the party will be lucky to gain more than two percent of the votes at the May 1 election.</p>
<p>But this could cost the Conservatives vital seats in marginal seats and help send them into opposition for the first time in 18 years.</p>
<p>Newlyn is part of the marginal St Ives constituency, which the Conservatives won in the 1992 election by polling just 1,645 votes more than the minority Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>Mick Faulkner, the local Referendum party candidate, says the 3,000 fishermen based in Newlyn are bound to vote for him.</p>
<p>The trawlermen are united in their opposition to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which was designed to both divide up fish stocks among member states and prevent over-fishing.</p>
<p>In reality, fishermen say, the CFP has allowed foreign boats to haul in so much British fish that the local industry is now under serious threat.</p>
<p>The fishermen want the CFP to be scrapped but some want it replaced with a new system and other think Britain should declare sovereignty over its own waters.</p>
<p>Fishermen are also upset that some Spanish fishermen are registering their boats in Britain to take advantage of the British quotas, a practice known as &quot;quota-hopping&quot;.</p>
<p>The Referendum Party has vowed to dissolve itself once a referendum on Europe has been announced.</p>
<p>Both Labour, 20 points ahead in the polls, and the Conservatives say they would not to join a European single currency during the life of the next parliament without holding a referendum</p>
