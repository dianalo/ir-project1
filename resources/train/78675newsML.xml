<p>Living a campaigning politician's fondest dream, President Bill Clinton championed motherhood on Thursday by signing a law that guarantees women a 48-hour hospital stay after childbirth.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents may rush to the hospital but they shouldn't be rushed out of it unless it's the right thing to do for the parent and the child. This law is common sense and now it is the law of the land,&quot; Clinton said at a Rose Garden ceremony.</p>
<p>The &quot;Newborns' and Mothers' Protection Act&quot; was tied to a $64.4 billion government money bill that also improves health benefits for mental patients and children with spina bifida born to Vietnam veterans.</p>
<p>It grew out of public complaints about health care plans that forced new mothers to leave the hospital as soon as 10 hours after a normal delivery. The new law requires health insurers to let women stay in the hospital for 48 hours after a normal delivery and 96 hours after a Caesarean.</p>
<p>The so-called 48-hour rule, which could reinforce the &quot;gender gap&quot; advantage that Clinton enjoys over Republican challenger Bob Dole, was approved by a Republican-controlled Congress that was increasingly putting its own interests above those of the party's trouble-plagued presidential candidate.</p>
<p>The gender gap referred to election polls that showed women voters prefer Clinton to Dole by as much as 29 percentage points.</p>
<p>&quot;By ensuring 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and newborns, battling discrimination against mental illness, caring for children of veterans who suffer from a terrible disease, we affirm that we will do everything we can to strengthen our families,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>The health care reforms were attached to a bill providing money for federal housing programmes, veterans' health care, environmental protection and space research.</p>
<p>The new maternity and mental health rules take effect on Jan. 1, 1998 while the spina bifida provision will start Oct. 1, 1997. The expansion of mental health coverage was expected to benefit 75 million Americans with group health insurance and those covered by government-funded Medicaid.</p>
<p>While health plans will not be required to cover mental illness, those that do will no longer be permitted to set lower maximum payment amounts for mental health treatment.</p>
<p>An estimated 3,000 children of Vietnam veterans, many of whom are now adults, stand to share in about $44 million worth of disability benefits, job training support and health care provided by veterans' hospitals.</p>
<p>The benefit was provided after studies showed a link between children born with spina bifida, a crippling neurological birth defect, and exposure to Agent Orange while the father served in Vietnam.</p>
<p>&quot;The children of our soldiers should not have to suffer for the sacrifice of their parents,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Several mothers with infants attended the Rose Garden bill-signing ceremony, which also featured remarks by Vice President Al Gore, his wife Tipper and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p>With less than six weeks left before the election, Clinton holds a double-digit overall lead over Dole in most of the polls, and nearly every domestic issue on which presidential elections usually turn has been breaking his way.</p>
<p>Clinton's soaring political fortunes got a further boost with the release of annual census data on household income.</p>
<p>&quot;In one year median household income was up $898 after inflation. That's the biggest increase in a decade. Over the last two years, the typical American family has seen its income rise $1,600 over inflation,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>The figures gave the Democratic president powerful new ammunition with which to counter a key thrust of Dole's campaign, which is that Americans would be better off economically by putting him in the White House.</p>
