<p>THE DOMINION</p>
<p>Hundreds of patients waiting for operations at seven hospitals in the lower North Island, Nelson and Malborough will get a letter in the next fortnight telling them they are off surgery waiting lists. The move comes as the Central Regional Health Authority prepares to eliminate waiting lists in favour of booking times in line with government policy. As a first step, it has set interim financially sustainable thresholds for cataracts, joint replacements, gall bladder and prostate surgery. Page 1.</p>

<p>A register of crime victims would be kept so they could be invited to have their say at offenders' parole hearings, Justice Minister Doug Graham said on Tuesday. The government has agreed to give victims the right to be advised of parole hearings so they can make submissions. Graham said victims were already able to speak at parole hearings, but most were not aware when the offender was about to come up for parole because authorities were unable to contact them.

<p>It was too soon to press the panic button about teacher supply, the Education Ministry said on Tuesday. The ministry was monitoring the number of teachers seeking registration, the number of overseas teachers seeking work permits and the number of overseas teachers having their qualifications checked, the national manager of teacher recruiting Irene Lynch said.

<p>Some of the $8.8 million worth of work on the National Library's new computer system can be salvaged, even though the project has been terminated. The national document information system, a joint venture with the National Library and the  </p>
<p>Australian National Library, failed because of software problems. A source at the National Library said on Tuesday that cataloguing had been done in &quot;neutral language&quot;, which meant it could be used on different computer systems. That work, part of the $8.8 million spent on NDIS, could still be used. Page 2.</p>

<p>The Cabinet was likely to decide within the next month on how best to collapse four regional health authorities into one, Health Minister Bill English said on Tuesday. The National and NZ First coalition agreement promised a single funding body separate from the Health Ministry, rather than the four RHAs  </p>
<p>that buy services. Page 2.</p>

<p>Wholesale electricity prices tumbled last month as lakes filled and power generators supplied demand from their hydro plants. The wholesale market, under attack from critics in its first few months, seems to have bedded down, with none of the super price spikes seen in early days. The lowest price for the month was 0.10 cents a kilowatt hour at the South Island Benmore reference point. The North Island's lowest price was 0.11 cents at the Haywards reference point. Page 14.</p>

<p>McCain Group founder Harrison McCain reiterated on Tuesday that his company planned to expand the Grower Foods operations in Hastings purchased late last year. Speaking in Hastings, McCain, who established the McCain Group in Canada with his brother in 1957, said his company had never taken over an operation that it had not expanded. &quot;We are a large-volume operator,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot fool around.&quot; Page 14.</p>

<p>Contact Energy has made significant write-downs for its first financial period, leading to a net loss of $32.6 million. Contact's report for the eight months to the end of September, issued on Tuesday, shows the company produced a pre-tax operating surplus of $73.1 million. During that period Contact sold its power to ECNZ and was reimbursed. Both companies are now operating independantly in the wholesale market that began on October 1. Page 14.</p>

<p>St Lukes Group on Tuesday confirmed the $113 million purchase of the Riccarton Shopping Centre in Christchurch. The acquisition, from the Prudential Group, is to be financed through debt and will increase the group's assets by 20 percent. Riccarton is the first South Island shopping mall purchase for St Lukes, which has most of its centres in Auckland.</p>

<p>Max Resources plans to sell its gold mining assets as it focuses on its new organic fertiliser business, a director, Owen McShane, said on Tuesday. Max expected to conclude negotiations this week on the sale of its stake in the Norseman gold project in Western Australia, where it owns about 14 percent of the existing resource base, he said. The main shareholder is Australian Gold Mines.</p>

<p>Wholesale electricity prices trumbled last month as lakes filled and power generators supplied demand from their hydro plants. The three-month-old wholesale market, under attack from critics in its first few months, seems to have bedded down, with none of the huge price spikes seen in early days.</p>
