<p>Koninklijke Boskalis Westminster NV said on Thursday the outlook for the international dredging market over the coming years was encouraging.</p>
<p>&quot;Barring unforeseen circumstances, net profits compared to 1996 could grow substantially, whereby benefits can be drawn from the improved size and quality of the current order book, particularly in the second half of the year,&quot; Boskalis said.  </p>
<p>It said that in view of the size and quality of the order book at the beginning of 1997 it was counting on a higher turnover and full capacity utilisation in the current year.</p>
<p>It added that it would invest heavily again in 1997, partly due to the construction of two 'jumbo trailers'.</p>
<p>&quot;The balance sheet, however, remains very solid,&quot; Boskalis said.</p>
<p>The world's largest dredger earlier posted 1996 net profits of 62.1 million guilders, compared with 70.9 million in 1995. Analysts had expected a 1996 net profit of between 62 and 72 million guilders.  </p>
<p>Boskalis said turnover and profits had recovered well in the second half of 1996 but not enough to compensate for the mediocre first half of the year.</p>
<p>The market has clearly improved in 1996 with a number of large-scale projects having come into operation in the Far East in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Boskalis said the danger of overcapacity in the market segment for large trailers was considered to be small although many market players were increasing trailer capacity.</p>
