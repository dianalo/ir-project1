<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks slump on auction hike, certification.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks slump on auction hike, certification.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-03-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks pared losses at the close on Wednesday but still ended sharply down for the second day in a row.</p>
<p>Traders said share prices fell on a combination of soaring primary rates and uncertainty over a bill to certify Mexico's anti-drug fight in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;We recovered a little twards the close on the back of the Dow Jones,&quot; a Mexico City floor trader said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index closed down 46.03 points, or 1.21 percent, at 3,758.09.  </p>
<p>The IPC probed support, analysts said, to reach a low of 3,747.79 points in late trade.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones pared losses to close 0.65 percent lower at 7,039.37 points.</p>
<p>Bellwether 28-day Cetes rates climbed 201 basis points to 23.17 percent at Tuesday evening's primary auction, compared to an average increase of 93 basis points predicted in a Reuters survey.</p>
<p>Analysts said continuing fears over the debate in the U.S. Congress to decertify Mexico exacerbated jitters triggered by high interest rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is still nervous and there has been no news to revive it. And then the Mexico (drug war) certification process is making waves,&quot; said Jaime Fernandez, an equity analyst at the Interacciones brokerage.</p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives Rules committee cleared the way for a vote on a bill on Thursday to decertify Mexico as an ally in the drugs war.</p>
<p>News came in late trade that Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said decertification &quot;would not be salutary&quot; for the Mexican economy.  </p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, foreign investors are staying away as they feel the peso is still a little too firm,&quot; Fernandez added.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed 0.1 of a centavo firmer at 7.9670/7.9700 per dollar.</p>
<p>The lack of foreign investors could be seen in trading volume of 105.9 million shares, of which cross trades accounted for one-third.</p>
<p>Telecomms firm Telmex L shares, down 12 centavos to 15.88 pesos, weighed most heavily on the market after accounting for 9 percent of all shares traded.  </p>
<p>Dealers drew attention to a fall below the $40 barrier by Telmex ADRs, which ended off 5/8 at 39-1/2.</p>
<p>&quot;I think telmex fell on market conditions. It moved ahead, but definitely hit the IPC,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the wage claim had an effect, but it could have been a pretext to take profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico's Telephonists' Union asked Telmex for a wage rise of 47.43 percent during the day, to which the company will reply on April 4. The union has called for a strike on April 25 if their demands are not satisfied.  </p>
<p>On the broad market, 103 stocks were traded, of which decliners outnumbered gainers by 72 to 17.</p>
<p>Traders also noted sharp gains posted by restaurant franchise holder ECE, which launched a primary and secondary public offering on Wednesday. ECE gained 40 centavos from its issue price to close at 11.40 pesos.</p>
