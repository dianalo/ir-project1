<p>A Turkish pop song lamenting a man's attachment to his expensive foreign car kept Turks singing along for months; now the prospect of a flood of imported cars is drawing cries of protest from the domestic industry.</p>
<p>The government's duty-free import scheme, aimed at boosting its finances, has provoked hostile exchanges between ministers and Koc Holding, a major shareholder in leading Turkish car maker Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi.</p>
<p>Koc, Turkey's largest industrial group, warns surging imports could have dire consequences for domestic car makers, already pressured by a flood of imports under a customs accord with the European Union which began in January.</p>
<p>Car imports leapt to over 32,000 units, or 20 percent of the domestic market in the first nine months of 1996. A year earlier they amounted to just seven percent. Over the same period domestic production slumped 25 percent.</p>
<p>Local industry fears its position may be further undermined by a decree enabling three million Turkish expatriates to import one foreign car, up to four years old, duty free if they deposit 50,000 marks ($33,000) for one year at a state bank. The scheme was last week extended to all Turkish citizens.</p>
<p>The government, desperate for funds to bridge gaping deficits, targets 1996 deposits of 1.3 billion marks from expatriates alone under the scheme.</p>
<p>However, figures in mid-November showing that only $110 million has been raised so far suggest government hopes may be disappointed and industry fears overdone.</p>
<p>WARNINGS OF DRASTIC JOB LOSSES</p>
<p>Industry spokesmen warn any benefits from foreign currency earnings may be far overshadowed by drastic job losses and big sale declines for domestic car makers and point to a recent sharp fall in demand because of cheap import expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;There is very little demand in the market, but the full volume of the damage is still in front of us,&quot; said Ercan Tezer, head of Turkey's Automobile Industrialists Association (OSD).</p>
<p>The OSD is planning to apply to an adminstrative court to seek the annulment of the import decree, which it has forecast may bring 50,000 foreign cars annually into Turkey. It said each car may cost the job of one worker in the automobile sector, which employs about 400,000 workers in 16 production plants and nearly 500 parts makers.</p>
<p>The media has attacked the import scheme for benefiting mainly those wealthy enough to save 50,000 marks. It was suggested such policies contradicted the commitment of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to helping society's poorest.</p>
<p>&quot;What sort of a Just Order is this?&quot; the liberal Yeni Yuzyil daily asked in a headline referring to Erbakan's economic theory which stresses boosting production as the basis of long-term prosperity.</p>
<p>At the moment it is more cuts in production that top the agenda at Tofas, whose control of half the domestic market is under increasing pressure from local ventures involving Renault SA, Toyota and Adam Opel.</p>
<p>Tofas has put all its 4,500 workers on temporary compulsory leave after capacity usage fell below 40 percent at its Bursa plant and is making 1,011 workers redundant from January.</p>
<p>KOC WARNS OF MORE CUTBACKS</p>
<p>The chairman of Koc, which has a near-40 percent stake in Tofas, warned of more cutbacks if vehicle sales fell further.</p>
<p>Raising the stakes in the import row, Rahmi Koc issued a veiled warning to the government last week about the possible impact of the scheme on the future of Tofas.</p>
<p>&quot;Tofas is a company which has paid its dues. If necessary it will be closed tomorrow, but this business won't go as far as closure,&quot; Koc told reporters at an International Chambers of Commerce meeting in the southern Turkish resort of Antalya.</p>
<p>He went on to rule out selling the Tofas stake to the venture's foreign partner Fiat Spa, which like Koc has a 38 percent stake in the car manufacturer.</p>
<p>Industry Minister Yalim Erez, attending the same meeting as Koc in Antalya, responded with sharp criticism of the Koc Group for laying off workers at a time when there are already seven million people unemployed in Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't take any decision to destroy Turkish industry, but we won't condemn the Turkish consumer to goods which are expensive and lacking quality,&quot; Erez said, without expanding.</p>
<p>Erez contrasted the Tofas actions to that of the second largest domestic car maker OYAK-Renault Otomobil Fabrikalari AS, 57 percent owned by Renault and 43 percent by the Turkish armed forces pension fund OYAK, which has a 30 percent market share.</p>
<p>The decree has not yet prompted job cuts by the Renault venture, or other growing competitors like Toyotosa, with a 12 percent slice and Opel, with a 5 percent share of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;OYAK-Renault is ready to fight against the new situation presented by the used car imports,&quot; Laurent Lepine, product planning manager at OYAK-Renault, told Reuters.</p>
<p>While there was some concern about the import scheme, more problems were presented by high taxation levels and a lack of clarity in the government's automotive industry policy, he said.</p>
<p>TURKEY HAS ROOM FOR YET MORE CARS</p>
<p>Lepine said the company nevertheless saw growth potential in the domestic market. Car ownership in Turkey stands at only 50 per thousand, compared with around 400 per thousand in developed countries.</p>
<p>But car output, which surged around eight percent annually in the late 80s and early 90s has not yet recovered from the economic and financial crises in 1994, since when the workforce at Tofas has been halved to 100,000.</p>
<p>The growing import crisis may erode further the domestic automotive industry's ability to benefit from future growth.</p>
