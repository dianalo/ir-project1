<p>Aluminium packaging sector in Asia is coming under increasing threat from substitutes, the head of Australian aluminium group Aluvic said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the packaging sector, manufacturers are able to become increasingly price responsive with PET making inroads, as well as plastic coated tinplate in Japan, which has captured markets which were expected to go to aluminium,&quot; Aluvic managing director Greg Turnidge said told a commodities conference.  </p>
<p>Aluvic is owned by the state government of Victoria and acts has a holding company for the state's aluminium industry interests, in particular its 25 percent stake in the Portland aluminium smelter, Australia's largest.</p>
<p>Metalised plastic is also showing strong growth, he told the Australian Bureau of Agricutural and Resource Economics (ABARE) annual Outlook conference in Canberra.</p>
<p>The battle for market share between aluminium cans, glass and PET bottles is primarily driven by consumer demand, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The major producers view packaging as an important marketing edge with glass and PET viewed by consumers as more modern and therefore more marketable,&quot; Turnidge said.</p>
<p>This is borne out by the use of PET in Asia by such companies as Coca-Cola Co and Pepsico Inc and premier beer makers in Asia.</p>
<p>Working in favour of aluminium beverage cans is that the smaller the PET bottle, the lower the shelf life of the product and the higher the manufacturing cost, Turnidge said.</p>
<p>&quot;This has helped the beverage can remain as the preferred packaging for half a litre and below,&quot; Turnidge said.  </p>
<p>In Japan, demand for aluminium from the packaging sector grew by 3.5 percent last year, due in large part to a long hot summer, which caused people to drink more canned beverages, he said. Chinese consumers would rather drink from glass, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;For there to be a fundamental shift toward aluminium, there will need to be a shift in domestic consumer preferences,&quot; he said.</p>
