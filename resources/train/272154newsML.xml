<title>JAPAN: Japan finds bomb dropped by U.S. warplane.</title>

<p>Japan's armed forces said on Sunday they had found a bomb jettisoned by a U.S. aircraft off Japan's southernmost island of Okinawa earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;We found the bomb on the seabed in waters about 11 km (seven miles) west of Okinawa,&quot; said a spokesman for Japan's Defence Agency, adding that United States forces had begun salvage work.</p>
<p>Although the bomb jettisoned by a Marine Corps plane fell harmlessly into the sea, it prompted a furore over the way in which U.S. and Japanese authorities responded to the incident.</p>
<p>It took the U.S. military six hours to notify the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and the ministry did not immediately report it to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, saying later that the report had been unconfirmed.</p>
<p>The coastguard had waited a full 24 hours before sealing off the area to inter-island ferries.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan agreed on Thursday to a scheme allowing for a prompt exchange of information on incidents involving U.S. forces based in Japan.</p>
<p>Okinawa accommodates more than 75 percent of all U.S. military facilities in Japan, a legacy of the U.S. Occupation which followed a bloody World War Two battle there in 1945.</p>
<p>A public outcry against the huge U.S. military presence on the island erupted last year after the rape of a local schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen.</p>
<p>Japan and the United States agreed in December to streamline U.S. bases on Okinawa, but without reducing the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed there.</p>
