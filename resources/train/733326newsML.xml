<p>High temperatures of 90F or above will dominate much of the Plains, Midwest, and East in the USA the next few days. In the Southwest, desert regions may see temperatures near 110F in a few locations. Heat-related problems are expected as a result of the widespread hot weather affecting many major cities.  </p>
<p>In the eastern Pacific Ocean, Enrique has been downgraded to a tropical storm with 63 mph winds about 1350 miles west of Baja, and is expected to move northwest, while steadily weakening, only threatening shipping. Tropical Depression 08E has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Felicia, which is centered about 725 miles south southwest of Baja and is expected to continue strengthening. In the Atlantic, Tropical Depression Claudette is about 580 miles south southwest of Sable Island Novia Scotia and is expected to dissipate within 24 hours.  </p>
<p>Northeastern India and Bangladesh have seen heavy rain and major flooding in recent days. Property and crop damage has occurred. More showers and thunderstorms in the coming days may further complicate the flooding situation.</p>
