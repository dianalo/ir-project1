<headline>FORECAST - Analysts do not see Swedish repo cut Tues.</headline>

<p>Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, will not lower its key interest rate, the repo, at its weekly tender on Tuesday, according to seven of 12 economists polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>The weak crown was seen as the main reason keeping the repo at 4.10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The crown is too volatile and too weak. Everything else is supportive of a cut, but I don't think it will be now,&quot; said Bjorn Englund, Unibank Markets economist.</p>
<p>At the end of January, Riksbank deputy governor Lars Heikensten said information about the economy and price development was giving a more positive picture of inflation in 1997.</p>
<p>However, he said the currency was somewhat weaker than the bank had expected.</p>
<p>The Trade Currency Weighted (TCW) index, used to measure the value of the crown against other currencies, has risen to a nominal 120.77.</p>
<p>The Riksbank earlier said a reasonable level for the TCW-index was between 109 to 118, with a preference for the lower end of this range.</p>
<p>The index peaked at a nominal 122.57 on February 6 and is currently at 119.19.</p>
<p>Most economists also expected the Riksbank to wait and see the Prospera inflation forecast survey, due on Wednesday. The bank commissions the survey.</p>
<p>Some expected the Riksbank to delay a repo rate cut until after its inflation report on March 20.</p>
<p>Three of the economists surveyed thought there was a 50/50 chance the Riksbank would lower the repo rate on Tuesday and two expected a cut.</p>
<p>The repo rate, which is the bank's key tool for controlling money market liquidity, was last lowered on December 17, the same day as the Riksbank's last inflation report.</p>
<p>Last year, the repo rate was cut 25 times, taking it down to its current 4.10 percent fom 8.91 percent.</p>
<p>Economists included in the poll were from Carnegie, Den Danske, Hagstromer &amp; Qviberg, Handelsbanken, HSBC Midland, JP Morgan, Nordbanken, PaineWebber, Salomon Brothers, S-E-Banken, Swebank and Unibank Markets.</p>
