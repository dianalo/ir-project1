<p>The Bank of Japan's quarterly &quot;tankan&quot; short-term corporate survey on Wednesday confirmed the market view that the central bank will hold on to its ultra easy credit stance well into next year, economists said.</p>
<p>The survey will ensure that Japan's long- and short-term interest rates stay stably low in the coming months, they said.</p>
<p>The tankan's headline diffusion index (DI) of major manufacturers' business sentiment, an important gauge of corporate sentiment, improved to minus three in November from minus seven in August. But the widely watched forecast for the index next March stayed in negative territory at minus one, showing only a slight improvement in corporate sentiment.</p>
<p>The index represents the percentage of firms expecting business to improve minus those who expect it to worsen. The higher the number, the more optimistic the outlook.</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rallied on the tankan results, with the key December JGB futures contract rising as high as 126.30 against Tuesday's 125.30, before closing at 126.04. The dollar rose after the tankan and hit a high of 113.25 yen in late trade, against New York's 112.45/55 close.</p>
<p>Mamoru Yamazaki, senior economist at Paribas Capital Markets Ltd's Tokyo branch, said: &quot;The tankan results signalled the BOJ will have to keep its credit grip well relaxed for the time being in view of weak economic sentiment among companies.&quot;</p>
<p>A consumption tax increase planned for April, a major deflationary measure, would also underscore the need for the BOJ to maintain easy credit well into next year, he said.</p>
<p>The consumption tax will be raised to five percent from the current three percent in April 1997.</p>
<p>Soichi Okuda, senior economist at Nippon Credit Bank Ltd, agreed the BOJ would need to assess the impact of the consumption tax rise before raising interest rates. &quot;To assess the full impact of tax rise, the BOJ would need to wait until the August 1997 tankan (for any policy move),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BOJ has kept its official discount rate (ODR) -- which it charges on some loans to commercial banks -- at a record-low 0.5 percent since September 1995.</p>
<p>The yield spread between three-month rates and 10-year JGB yield of around 200 basis points &quot;will basically remain where it is, with chances of overshooting in the long-end of around 20 basis points both ways,&quot; Yamazaki said.</p>
<p>Nippon Credit's Okuda expects the 10-year JGB yield to remain in a narrow range for the rest of 1996, but sees a chance of the yield falling further in the January-March quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There are people who were still unable to buy all the bonds they need in their portfolios for the second half of fiscal 1996 (ending next March). Hence, demand for cash JGBs from these investors could push the 10-year yield down, possibly to a new record low, in late January or early February,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark cash 182nd JGB fell as low as 2.440 percent in Tokyo afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It had fallen to 2.405 percent on November 6, an all-time low for any benchmark cash JGB.</p>
<p>Yozo Nishimura, manager of the economic research division at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, expects long-term interest rates to remain flat or ease slightly in coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;The expected fiscal consolidation could slow the recovery pace, but the economy should nevertheless remain on a recovery track next year. Hence, we do not expect a further sharp fall in long-term rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That said, any rise in long-term interest rates to three percent seems quite unlikely,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In addition to the planned consumption tax rise, the likely decision by the government to discontinue special income tax cuts in 1997 is expected to become a deflationary factor next year, the economists said.</p>
