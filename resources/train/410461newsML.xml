<title>USA: Texas Pacific Group to buy Del Monte Foods.</title>
<headline>Texas Pacific Group to buy Del Monte Foods.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>An investor group led by Texas Pacific Group said Friday it has agreed to buy Del Monte Foods Co., the nation's largest producer of canned fruit and vegetable branded products.</p>
<p>The purchase price was not disclosed.</p>
<p>But sources familiar with the deal said it was worth at least $800 million, including the assumption of debt, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Del Monte, whose brand name was first used in 1891, was taken private in January 1990 and is now owned by a group of institutional, corporate and private investors.</p>
<p>The acquisition includes Del Monte brand packaged foods in the United States, including more than 375 products, but not the separate entities Del Monte Foods Europe, Del Monte Far East or Del Monte Fresh Produce.</p>
<p>The acquisition marks Texas Pacific's third major investment in the food and beverage industry in the last two years, and is a significant part of its acquisition and growth strategy in the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Del Monte is one of the premier names in the food industry with an unequalled reputation for quality and consumer value,&quot; said James Coulter, a founding partner of Texas Pacific. &quot;We view it as a platform for growth both through the development of new products and through acquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>In September 1995, the investment partnership bought the North American marshmallow and confections business from Kraft Foods, which is now called Favourite Brands. Favourite Brands has since added five other businesses, making it the fourth largest candy and confections company in the country.</p>
<p>In January 1996, the firm acquired the Beringer Wine Estates from Nestle's, including Meridian Vineyards, Napa Ridge and Chateau Souverain. Beringer subsequently has acquired Chateau St. Jean.</p>
<p>Del Monte is one of the world's leading processors of fruits, vegetables and tomatoes, with 1996 revenues of $1.2 billion. The company, based in San Francisco, has 2,100 employees with seasonal employment of up to 12,000.</p>
<p>Bank of America and Bankers Trust will supply senior and subordinated financing for the transaction.</p>
