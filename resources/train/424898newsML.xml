<p>Two out of every three Swedes want the state monopoly on alcohol sales scrapped but over 30 percent want the state to keep control of alcohol sales, according to a poll published on Thursday.</p>
<p>The survey by research institute IMRI found 63 percent of 1,000 interviewees wanted the monopoly abolished, as recommended this week by a European Court adviser.</p>
<p>However, 33 percent of respondents were in favour of the state keeping a tight grip on sales of wine and spirits. They can be bought only at state-owned shops, Systembolagets, during working hours, five days a week.</p>
<p>Five percent of those in the survey were undecided.</p>
<p>&quot;It is almost more surprising that as many as 33 percent actually are against abolishing (the monopoly),&quot; a spokesman for the Systembolaget chain, Bjorn Rydberg, told tabloid newspaper Aftonbladet.</p>
<p>&quot;After the uproar of the last few days ...I had not expected any other result. The word monopoly has a negative ring to it and I think this plays a large part in this.&quot;</p>
<p>The poll found 64 percent expected that ending the monopoly would increase the average Swede's alcohol consumption, which is one of the government's arguments for retaining a monopoly.</p>
<p>However, the European Court of Justice's Advocate-General Michael Elmer on Tuesday rejected the argument that the monopoly was justified on social and health grounds because of the nation's traditionally high levels of alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>He said European Union law was an obstacle to such retail sales regimes for alcohol and he would recommend to a full court in the next few months that the monopoly should end.</p>
<p>The alcohol monopoly is an important source of revenue for the government. In 1996 sales at the Systembolagets reached about 19 billion crowns ($2.5 billion).</p>
<p>($ = 7.643 Swedish Crowns)</p>
