<headline>CRICKET-WARNE HINTS AT IMPROVED FORM WITH 5-42.</headline>

<p>Shane Warne captured five for 42 to hint at improving form as the Australians snatched an 84-run win over English county champions Leicestershire on Monday.</p>
<p>Set a target of 264 in a minimum of 65 overs after two declarations on the third and last day, Leicester were bowled out for 179.</p>
<p>Paul Reiffel, who joined the touring party last week because of injuries to fellow pacemen Jason Gillespie and Andy Bichel, continued his encouraging start by adding three for 49 to his first innings three for 12.</p>
<p>Australian captain Mark Taylor said: &quot;Paul Reiffel bowled very well in this game and Warne also did in patches.</p>
<p>&quot;Shane is not at his best but he's getting there. There was a little bit more loop from him today and he was beginning to get the right shape and turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps he will come right during the Lord's test (starting on Thursday) or perhaps it might be the match after that. His shoulder is fine and the main thing with him has been getting used to a different type of ball over here.&quot;</p>
<p>An overnight declaration by Leicestershire 158 runs behind on first innings followed by a rapid Australian second innings of 105 for three declared, in which Taylor made 57 from 65 balls, set up the chance of a definite result to the rain-hit game.</p>
<p>Leicestershire captain James Whitaker got off the mark by hooking fast bowler Glenn McGrath for six but became Warne's first victim after scoring 21, lbw as he propped forward to a top spinner.</p>
<p>A Warne googly to Paul Nixon and a smart stumping by Ian Healy ended Leicestershire's last hope of forcing victory, with the leg-spinner and Reiffel mopping up the lower order.</p>
<p>Taylor said: &quot;This was a bit of a contrived result but it has been a month since we have won a game and I wanted to create a situation today in which we were bowling under a little bit of pressure to get a victory.</p>
<p>&quot;We will take a lot of positives from this game and I was more happy with our intensity in the field. There seemed to be more desire to win out there today than there was at Derby in the match before the first test.&quot;</p>
<p>Australia were trounced by nine wickets in the opening match of the six-test series at Edgbaston.</p>
