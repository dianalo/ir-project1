<p>------------------------- Feb 27 ----------------------------</p>
<p>* Index falls 14.40 points before trading halt</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine Stock Exchange suspended trading after about 20 minutes of moderate trade on Thursday due to a computer glitch, a bourse official said.</p>
<p>The official said the trading halt would be in effect until such time as the problem is resolved by the bourse's technicians who were still investigating the problem.</p>
<p>The composite index fell 14.40 points, or 0.43 percent, to 3,335.42 before the trading was suspended.  </p>
<p>&quot;Trading is a mess. We're trying to put in our orders but nothing is coming out on the screen,&quot; Lito Vicencio, a trader at Peregrine Securities, said.</p>
<p>Punters still ruled the market as thirdliners continued to attract heavy two-way trading. Blue chips were holding steady.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no aggressive selling nor buying on the blue chips,&quot; Vicencio said, when asked how was the market reacting to the latest remarks of U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan hinting at a possible increase in U.S. interest rates.  </p>
<p>Debuting Reynolds regained its footing after an early weakness which saw its price fall to a low fo 4.05 pesos. It was at its offer price of 4.55 pesos before trading was suspended.</p>
