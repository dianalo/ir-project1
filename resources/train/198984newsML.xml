<headline>Sonoco sees $1 bln capital spending plans.</headline>
<dateline>HARTSVILLE, S.C. 1996-11-19</dateline>

<p>Sonoco Products Co said on Tuesday it would spend over a billion dollars on capital projects between 1995 and 2000, compared with about $670 million in the preceding six years.</p>
<p>The company said it had numerous expansion programs aimed at increasing capacity and productivity in several businesses, including an expansion of the infrastructure at its seven-inch paper mill in Hartsville and a two billion bag capacity expansion at its Indiana plastic bag plant.  </p>
<p>Sonoco said about 80 percent of its revenue comes from its domestic operations, but it is commited to its international customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Sonoco has many customers, located in more than 85 countries, who are expanding their products internationally,&quot; said Peter Browning, president and chief operating officer. &quot;These international plant infrastructure, productivity, market leadership and experience make us a company they can turn to for management of their total packaging supply chain.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of its large domestic business, the company said it would have to grow these operations to meet its goal of doubling the company's size from the 1994 base.</p>
<p>The majority of this growth would be internal, Browning said. The pressure sensitive label business would be one of the most important growth areas for the domestic operations, he said.</p>
