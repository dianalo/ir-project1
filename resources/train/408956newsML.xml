<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Stadium Australia denies float in trouble.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Stadium Australia denies float in trouble.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stadium Australia said on Thursday a newspaper report saying the A$364.4 million float of the Sydney Olympic stadium was in trouble was not correct.</p>
<p>A Stadium Australia spokeswoman told Reuters &quot;considerably more than a third&quot; of the stadium's packages of Olympic tickets and memberships had been sold.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday the Sydney Morning Herald reported market talk that the float's underwriters had sold only about a third of the packages and were exposed to an underwriting shortfall of about A$240 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The underwriters are confident that ultimately all of it will get away,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The four underwriters are ANZ Securities, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Macquarie Bank Ltd, and ABN Amro Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>&quot;Sources said exposures varied amoung the four underwriters,&quot; the Herald said.</p>
<p>&quot;Deutsche and ANZ are believed to have the greatest exposure while Macquarie Bank has sold the most gold passes of the four brokers,&quot; the newspaper said.  </p>
<p>The spokeswoman said she would not comment on how much exposure each of the underwriters had. She said she also would not say exactly how many of the packages had been sold.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald was not in a position to accurately say how the float was progressing when there was over a month to go before the current March 27 closure of the offering, she said.</p>
<p>Stadium Australia opened its offer of 34,400 gold packages at A$10,000 each and 600 platinum passes at A$33,000 each on October 7 and had planned to close it November 29.  </p>
<p>This was first extended to December 13 and has since been extended to March 27.</p>
<p>The gold packages include a seat at every stadium session of the 2000 Olympic games, stadium membership for 30 years and 1,000 shares in the stadium company itself.</p>
<p>The platinum package include two priority seats and greater membership priveleges over the ensuing 30 years.</p>
