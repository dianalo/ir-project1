<p>The world's fleet of tankers grew by 41 vessels to 3,241 in the first half of 1996 as deliveries of new ships exceeded the number being scrapped, shipping brokers Jacob &amp; Partners Ltd said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The addition of 70 newly-built vessels with a combined capacity of 7.4 million deadweight tonnes (dwt) more than offset the 29 deliveries to scrapyards, boosting world tonnage by just over four million dwt.</p>
<p>&quot;This maintained the trend commencing in mid 1995 so that the fleet has now risen by about 5.5 million dwt over 12 months,&quot; said Jacobs in its World Tanker Fleet Review.</p>
<p>But despite steady growth, the rate of new building was still significantly below the recent high of 17.4 million dwt in 1993 and the annual record of over 44 million posted in 1975.</p>
<p>Commercial tanker tonnage -- excluding vessels owned or chartered by governments or those which are used primarily for purposes other than transport -- remained 19 percent below the 1977 peak of 332 million dwt despite growing by 3.7 million.</p>
<p>Japan and South Korea built 85 percent of the tonnage delivered in the first half of the year and account for about 70 percent of the new orders confirmed in the same period.</p>
<p>Spain continued to lead the field of European shipbuilding nations, Jacobs said.</p>
<p>&quot;Other European success was spread very thinly with Croatian and Ukrainian shipyards each completing three vessels.&quot;</p>
<p>The number of new orders for crude tankers placed between January and June 1996 was similar to the second half of 1995 but interest for oil product tankers doubled and even more confidence was noted in the chemical sector, Jacobs said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sixty-six new tanker orders amounting to 4.3 million dwt were placed or confirmed during the first half of 1996, significantly more in terms of ship numbers than in the previous six months when 40 vessels were ordered but with greater emphasis placed on products tankers only 21 percent more tonnage,&quot; the broker's review said.</p>
