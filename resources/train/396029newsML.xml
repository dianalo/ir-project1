<p>Two weeks into the English season Sheffield Wednesday sat proudly at the top of the league. Four straight wins had done the trick.</p>
<p>It was the Yorkshire side's best start for decades and the talk was of whether they would be serious championship contenders.</p>
<p>Experienced manager David Pleat was not fooled though and refused to be drawn into such speculation so early.</p>
<p>He evidently knew his team was not quite right and his reticence proved well founded as the flying start was followed by 10 games without a victory. The run included a first round exit from the League Cup against first division Oxford.</p>
<p>But just as Pleat had not been carried away by the flying start, he refused to panic during the long, lean spell.</p>
<p>Wednesday stopped the rot with a win over Nottingham Forest on November 18 and have only lost once since.</p>
<p>That run of one defeat in 20 games has taken them to eighth place and the chance of a UEFA Cup place -- and much of the credit must belong to Pleat.</p>
<p>Wednesday travelled to Southampton on Saturday having not lost at The Dell since 1970. But it looked as if the run was over as Egil Ostenstad and Matt Le Tissier, from the penalty spot, had the home side deservedly 2-0 up at halftime.</p>
<p>Saints also hit the woodwork twice but Pleat's introduction of Regi Blinker and Andy Booth for Wayne Collins and Ritchie Humphreys for the second half changed the game around.</p>
<p>David Hirst, who has struggled to hold a regular place this season, hit two in six minutes to make it 2-2 -- and Southampton collapsed.</p>
<p>There was only going to be one winner as Wednesday poured forward. Their reward came 12 minutes from time when the impressive Mark Pembridge fed Ian Nolan who crossed for Andy Booth to score from close in.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortune favours the brave,&quot; said Pleat. &quot;We came out battling and the lads now feel six feet tall.&quot;</p>
<p>Hirst, described Saturday's showing as &quot;a Jekyll and Hyde performance. &quot;The boss had words with a few people at the break and threw on the two subs,&quot; said the striker.</p>
<p>&quot;We knew we could play much better than we had in the first half and threw caution to the wind.&quot;</p>
<p>Hirst, whose career has been blighted by a series of injuries, was delighted to be back in favour after scoring a late equaliser at Derby on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, the manager put me in and I thoroughly enjoyed it,&quot; he said.</p>
