<p>Retired CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite will leave the hospital Wednesday, eight days after he underwent a successful quadruple bypass operation, the network announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement released by CBS, the 80-year-old Cronkite said, &quot;They (the doctors) said my recovery is right on schedule and that I'm in excellent shape. I asked them if I'd be able to play singles tennis and they said I could. That made me very happy since I haven't played in five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Cronkite, who retired as the anchorman for the CBS Evening News in 1981 after 17 years, said he was looking forward to resuming a normal life, going back on his boat and doing several television projects.</p>
<p>Cronkite underwent heart bypass surgery at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Centre on April 1.</p>
