<p>A South Korean container ship sank after colliding with another ship early Wednesday off a southern South Korean coast, but all the 11 crew members on board the sunken vessel were rescued, maritime police said.</p>
<p>An officer at the Pusan Maritime Police said by telephone a small amount of fuel oil leaked from the 1,921 gross tonne Jang Yung Lotus after it sank, but said the spill was not serious.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some oil leakage, but the amount is negligible because it's only a small part of the 48 tonnes of Bunker C oil carried by the Jang Yung Lotus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the ship was bound for Moji, Japan, after departing the port of Pusan at around 1:20 a.m. (1620 GMT Tuesday) when it collided in dense fog with the 2,854-gross-ton Lucky Star.</p>
<p>Lucky Star is owned by Nam Sung Shipping Co and Jang Yung Lotus by Jang Yung Line Co, both based in Seoul.</p>
<p>All the 11 crewmembers aboard the Jang Yung Lotus were rescued immediately by the Lucky Star, which returned to the Pusan port several hours later, he said.</p>
<p>He said the sunken vessel was carrying 45 containers filled with unspecified cargo, and several of them were still afloat.</p>
<p>&quot;We are more concerned about these containers floating than about the oil spilt because other ships could hit them as it gets darker,&quot; he said.</p>
