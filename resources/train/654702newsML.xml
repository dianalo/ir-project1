<p>COPPER - Building up for a move towards resistance at $2,540 and $2,550 following a constructive chart close on Tuesday. &quot;The 10-day moving average should now provide good support as prices look to challenge the recent highs at $2,548,&quot; LME brokers Brandeis said.</p>

<p>ALUMINIUM - A break above $1,630 could easily move prices towards $1,650, traders and analysts said. &quot;The next level of resistance is placed at $1,650, which we feel is obtainable, on the backdrop of falling stocks coupled with consumers generally operating on a hand to mouth basis,&quot; Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff said.</p>
<p>On the downside market operators pegged support at $1,600 and $1,580.</p>
<p>At 0750 GMT three months aluminium was quoted at $1,623/26, versus $1,618/22.</p>
