<headline>RTRS-Australia's Triangle to merges with NZ's McAlpine.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-11-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sydney-based commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning firm Triangle Refrigeration Australia said on Thursday it will merge with NZ's McAlpine Refrigeration Ltd.</p>
<p>With a turnover in excess of A$100 million and staff of about 450 the merged company will be one of the largest fully integrated commercial refrigeration companies in Australasia, Triangle said.</p>
<p>Triangle managing director Kevin Stainer said the merger provided each company with significant mutual benefits.</p>
<p>Triangle, which describes itself as the largest national refrigeration contracting company in Australia, has branches in six Australian cities as well as offices in China and Dubai.</p>
<p>However Stainer said it lacked a manufacturing base and saw an advantage in securing an interest in a major product supply line.</p>
<p>McAlpine Refrigeration, based in Auckland, is a leading player in the New Zealand commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning industry, the Triangle statement said.</p>
<p>McAlpine owns a custom-made cabinet manufacturing operation in Tauranga as well as an exclusive Australiasian distribution licence for Hussman Inc of the USA.</p>
<p>For McAlpine the merger fulfils a strategy to become a significant player in Australia and for Triangle it fulfils a strategy to secure a reputable refrigerated cabinet supply one line, Stainer said.</p>
<p>The company formed to control the group will be called McAlpine Triangle Australiasia Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>The new board will have equal representation from both companies.</p>
