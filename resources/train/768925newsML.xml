<p>The Hungarian share market finished at a seventh successive closing high as it received fresh impetus from first half earnings reports, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index closed at 7,880.16 points, up 67.10 points or 0.86 percent. It also set a new trading high of 7,926.58 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Earnings reports released today were reflected in the relevant share prices,&quot; said Laszlo Baranyai of Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals Richter, and chemicals TVK and BorsodChem released first half results on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Richter surged to a new high of 19,700 forints before retreating to close at 19,160, up 360. TVK also soared to a new high of 4,330 forints before finishing at 4,245, up 55.</p>
<p>Both hit new highs in London's SEAQ as well at $99.5 and $22.175, respectively.</p>
<p>BorsodChem finished at 7,300 forints, down 125.</p>
<p>Baranyai said a number of other stocks benefited from the rising trend, but added that &quot;quite many (investors) decided to cash in profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Nigel Rendell, Emerging European Strategist at HSBC James Capel in London said the market had more room to rise, mainly because not much else can be bought in eastern Europe at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see either of those two countries coming back into favour, particularly in the short-term, and as a result the Hungarian market is still going to do relatively well,&quot;he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult, though, to try to justify this kind of level of the index, or this kind of rally in terms of the fundamentals, in terms of valuation,&quot; Rendell added.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the market on Thursday, food shares rose to new highs, with tinned food maker Globus jumping to 2,850 forints, before ending at 2,800, up 170.</p>
<p>Meat processor Pick jumped to 15,350 forints, before ending at 15,000, up 500.</p>
