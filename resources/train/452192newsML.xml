<headline>Brooklyn Union, Lilco, in LIPA pact.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brooklyn Union Gas and Long Island Lighting Co (LILCO) said Wednesday they agreed in principle to sell some assets to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA).</p>
<p>Under the agreement LIPA would buy LILCO's electric transmission and distribution system, substantially all of its regulatory assets and its share of the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear plant by paying cash for stock valued at approximately $2.5 billion in holding company to be formed by Brooklyn Union and LILCO.  </p>
<p>Brooklyn Union and LILCO anticipate the purchase of stock by LIPA will result in proceeds of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion after the payment of taxes and short-term liability.</p>
<p>The companies said the yet to be named holding company would include Brooklyn Union's entire operations and LILCO's natural gas distribution system, non-nuclear electric generating assets and certain other assets.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Union and LILCO announced their intention to merge on December 29, 1996, creating a $4 billion electric and gas company.  </p>
<p>The merger is conditioned upon approval of each company's shareholders and various regulatory agencies including the New York Public Service Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>LILCO's shareholder meeting will be held on May 8, 1997 while Brooklyn Union expects to announce the date of their shareholder meeting in the near future.</p>
<p>Separately, New York State Governor Pataki said the pact would lower Long Island electric rates by over 20 percent in the next five years.  </p>
<p>LIPA will assume or refinance approximately $3.6 billion of the $4.5 billion of LILCO debt anticipated outstanding at the closing.  The balance will become the obligation of the combined Brooklyn Union-LILCO company or one or more of its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Union and LILCO also expect $363 million of the $702 million of the LILCO preferred stock seen outstanding at the closing will be exchanged for preferred stock of the combined company or one of its subsidiaries, and the balance will be redeemed by LIPA.  </p>
<p>LIPA said it anticipates financing the transaction through tax-exempt bonds.</p>
<p>The two companies said they expect to continue current dividend policies until the pact is consummated.</p>
<p>The combined company would enter into a Management Services Agreement with LIPA to manage LIPA's assets for an initial term of eight years. Thereafter, the mannagement would be awarded through a competitive bidding process. The combined company agreed to honor existing labor contracts.</p>
<p>LIPA and the combined company would also enter into a 15-year power supply agreement. Under the agreement, LIPA would purchase the approximately 3,900 megawatts of Long Island generation capacity currently owned by LILCO.</p>
<p>The companies said upon completion of the deal the exchange ratio in the Brooklyn Union/LILCO share exchange will be adjusted so ownership of the LILCO shareholders in the combined company will increase from approximately 66 percent to approximately 68 percent.</p>
<p>The number of shares of the new company that each share of LILCO will be exchanged for will be increased from .803 to .880 shares if a LIPA transaction is consummated.</p>
<p>In either case, each share of Brooklyn Union will be exchanged for one share of the new company.</p>
