<headline>IBCA seen reacting less harshly to NYC budget gaps.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>IBCA, a major Euoropean rating agency, was expected to take a much less harsh view of New York City's big, projected budget gaps than U.S. ratings agencies in a report due out shortly, city sources said last week.</p>
<p>The city sources, who declined to be named, said in interviews with Reuters on Friday that the London-based agency likely would underscore New York City's success in balancing its budgets over the past 16 years and suggest that focusing on estimated gaps might not be the proper approach.</p>
<p>Instead, IBCA evidently applauded New York City's five-year budgets, which have been required since its mid-1970s debt crisis, because they strengthened planning, while at the same time, not slam the Giuliani Administration for failing to balance its books in future years.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that (the city) has any long-range projections is so unusual, it's a great planning tool, but when you do that, given the nature of government and politics, it's not surprising that you have gaps, because if you had surpluses, how would you deal with Albany and the unions,&quot; one source explained.</p>
<p>If New York City projected surpluses in later years, the Giuliani Administration might have a tougher time pushing New York State for aid and negotiating lean contracts with city workers. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has estimated that the city will face a nearly $2 billion budget gap in the 1999 fiscal year, which widens to almost $2.9 billion in 2000.</p>
<p>In the fiscal 1998 budget that was agreed in early June, the mayor rolled over an unprecedented $856 million surplus, which largely reflects the boomming profits Wall Street earned in calender year 1996.</p>
<p>The New York City Council has projected bigger tax revenues, but the mayor has the sole authority to make this determination.</p>
<p>City sources have charged that the mayor was squirreling away funds for this year's mayoral election by using overly cautious projections, but Administration officials have emphasized that it would be poor practice to use anything but conservative estimates, to avoid the risk that a surprise downturn would force New York City to make emergency cuts.</p>
<p>Domestic rating agencies have applauded the mayor's cautious approach, but stressed that the city needs to achieve long-term, strucutural balance, as it cannot count on financial powerhouses and markets to stay strong. IBCA cited New York City's &quot;currently robust finances&quot; as one the reasons behind its rating decision, as well as the systems that ensure debt is paid promptly.</p>
<p>Another difference between domestic rating agencies and IBCA's approach was that the European agency was anticipated to take a less dim view of one-shots--using nonrecurring revenues to balance the books--than local fiscal monitors, who have harshly criticized such steps.</p>
<p>&quot;They basically were not as upset about a reasonable amount of one-shots,&quot; one city source said. &quot;They've said we've obviously demonstrated control over the budget.&quot;</p>
<p>IBCA also appeared to give more weight to a broad political consensus they saw about the city's future. None of the mayoral candidates, for example, are campaigning for big tax increases, another city source noted.</p>
<p>Further, the European rater also seemed to take a longer-term perspective, paying more heed to the progress the city has made in fighting crime and other social problems, since the 1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;They take a very broad view. Many rating agencies and analysts get bogged down in what happened in the last three weeks,&quot; a city source said.</p>
