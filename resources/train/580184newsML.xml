<headline>Bank of England says further tightening needed.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Bank of England said a further tightening was needed in monetary policy if the country was to hit the inflation target of 2.5 percent or lower in the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;The central projection for inflation and the risks surrounding it suggests that, on the present evidence, there is still likely to be a need for some further moderate tightening of policy in the months ahead,&quot; it said in its quarterly Inflation Report.  </p>
<p>&quot;Despite the rise in the exchange rate, inflation is more likely than not to be above the target two years or so ahead unless action is taken to slow the pace of expansion,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why the Bank has argued for several months that a tightening of monetary policy was necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank said last week's interest rate rise to 6.25 percent from 6.0 percent was &quot;an appropriate step&quot; in the direction of tightening monetary policy.</p>
<p>At a press briefing on the report, chief economist Mervyn King said the Bank would have to &quot;seriously consider raising interest rates in the coming months.&quot;  </p>
<p>But interest rate decisions could not be second-guessed, even on the basis of the report, King said. &quot;By how much and when, are questions we will answer month by month,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last week's rise in rates &quot;has clearly lowered the expectations (on inflation), all things being equal&quot;, King added.</p>
<p>In the report, the Bank said that on the assumption that interest rates and fiscal policy remained unchanged, the inflation outlook was &quot;about the same&quot; as in the last Inflation Report in February. It had then predicted inflation on a two-year horizon would be around three percent and rising.  </p>
<p>King added that the outlook for domestic demand was more buoyant than it had been in February and extending the projection to cover another quarter had also boosted the inflation profile slightly.</p>
<p>The new Labour government last week transferred operational responsibility for interest rates to the Bank.</p>
<p>The Bank said this should improve the credibility of monetary policy. It added that the announcement of the change had cut inflation expectations in the longer term by around half a percent.</p>
<p>King said the Bank had taken its new powers into account when advising last week's rate rise. He could not say what the advice would have been without the changes to the monetary regime.  </p>
<p>In the report, the Bank said the short-term outlook for inflation was encouraging because of the strength of sterling, but this was likely to be a one-off shock to the price level.</p>
<p>King said that to meet the inflation target in the medium term, underlying retail price inflation ought to be heading to substantially below 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>The Bank expressed concern at the strength of growth in the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Output growth in the UK is now above trend and rising. Inflation is close to the target and falling. That happy combination is, however, unsustainable,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;At some point, above-trend growth will lead to rising inflation,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The Bank warned that official GDP data were likely to be under-estimating economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Survey evidence, robust labour demand and strong broad money growth all suggest that current estimates of GDP may be under-estimating the pace of growth,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>This was particularly true for the expenditure measure of GDP and growth in some of the expenditure components was likely to be revised upwards. But the central bank saw no trade-off between growth and inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;We want growth to be as high as possible, consistent with the inflation target,&quot; King said.  </p>
<p>If anything, the new monetary policy regime, which is committed to delivering low inflation and stable growth, will improve &quot;the long-term growth and employment prospects of the economy, not damage it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The strength of broad money growth was also a worry, the Bank said. It was high in 1996 and had risen further this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is even less likely to be consistent with the inflation target in the medium-term than at the time of the February report,&quot; the Bank said.</p>
<p>Most economic indicators suggested that the labour market had tightened further and faster over the past few months. Earnings had also accelerated, partly because of high bonus payments, which could have implications for settlements over the coming year.</p>
<p>&quot;Private sector earnings, in particular, are growing at or above the maximum rate consistent with the inflation target set in 1995,&quot; the Bank said.</p>
<p>King said earnings growth much above 4.5 percent was a worry and the UK was &quot;sailing pretty close to the wind&quot; on earnings.</p>
<p>He said the Bank was happy with Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's plan to match the existing inflation target of 2.5 percent or less.</p>
