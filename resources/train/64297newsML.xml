<p>Israeli shares closed mixed with a negative bias as investors await the Bank of Israel's decision next Tuesday on interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 0.25 percent, or 0.49 points, to 196.02 on an all-share turnover of 80 million shekels against 86 million on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 index lost 0.17 percent to 205.76.</p>
<p>The market will be closed on Sunday and Monday because of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Trading will resume on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Activity was very low today and many Mishtanim shares were not traded at all. The market has gained almost 15 percent in the last three weeks and now it weakened a little,&quot; said Ronen Kaufman at Y.L.R Capital Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is in a waiting pattern as investors expect the central bank will lower interest rates by 0.5 percentage point on Tuesday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the most active share, fell 4.25 percent to 133,836 on very high volume of 15 million shekels. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel is expected to announce later on Thursday its recommendation concerning Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.</p>
<p>Traders said the share fell on profit taking following a rise of almost 30 percent in the last month.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline of Teva pushed the market downwards but the mood in the market is very positive. Investors are waiting for another interest rate cut that will lift the market again,&quot; said a trader at Bank Leumi.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutional investors were active buying today but others used the opportunity to take profits. Overall investors are optimistic and if the positive mood does not change in the coming days the market will continue to rise after Yom Kippur,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bezeq Israel Telecom, the second most active share, gained 1.0 percent to 845 on volume of 6.8 million shekels. Traders said someone was purchasing a large amount of shares in Bezeq for the third consecutive day. The identity of the buyer was unknown.</p>
<p>Bank Hapoalim rose 2.25 percent to 483 on turnover of 4.4 million shekels.</p>
<p>Venture capital fund Mofet surged 7.0 percent to 139.5 but traders said the share rose on very low volume.</p>
