<title>AUSTRALIA: Reduced Australia industry protection needed - ABARE.</title>

<p>Reductions in industry protection were necessary if the potential for growth in aggregate income in the Australian economy were to be realised, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) said.</p>
<p>Protection for specific industries may sustain those industries but at a cost to others and reduced income for the nation overall, senior economist Ivan Roberts said in releasing ABARE's latest study, Advantages of Trade Reform for Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Gains to aggregate incomes can be achieved through reducing industry protection irrespective of whether other countries do likewise,&quot; he said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, the greatest gains arise if reductions occur elsewhere as well as in Australia,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>Assistance to Australian manufacturing had been declining and was now much the same as for agriculture, he said.</p>
<p>However, within manufacturing and agriculture there remained activities which were heavily assisted, including textiles, clothing and footwear, motor vehicles and parts and milk, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is room for greater efficiency of resource use within the economy and associated increases in aggregate incomes through more liberal trade policies,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Industry protection could not provide a basis for increasing aggregate income and may not increase employment, Roberts said.</p>
<p>It supported some groups at the expense of others and reduced aggregate national income, he said.</p>
