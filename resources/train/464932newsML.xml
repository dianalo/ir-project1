<p>Shares of One Holding Plc were suspended at the company's request from Monday to March 28, 1997, the Stock Exchange of Thailand said.</p>
<p>The troubled firm had requested the suspension while it worked out with financial advisers how to repay its debts, the statement said. One Holding said last week it had defaulted on repayment due on some of its bonds.  </p>
<p>One Holding Plc, part of the One group of companies which include financier Finance One and broker Securities One, last week failed to pay $13.5 million owing on bills of exchange due to liquidity problems.</p>
<p>The company said it was working with financial advisers to complete an action plan to meet loan repayment schedules, the statement said.</p>
<p>Details of the plan could be sensitive to the firm's stock price, it said.</p>
<p>The firm's shares closed on Friday at a year low 2.70 baht, down from a year high of 66 baht.</p>
<p>One Holdings Plc has been used by Finance One as an investment arm. Finance One Plc recently announced plans to merge with Thai Danu Bank Plc in a move widely seen as tackling Finance One's own liquidity worries.</p>
