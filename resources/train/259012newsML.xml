<headline>US spot natgas soars on cold weather, NYMEX rally.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot natgas prices gained 40-60 cents Monday, as cold weather forecasts forced buyers to enter the market in large numbers, sources said.</p>
<p>Gulf prices rose by about 40 cents to the low-$4 area, up more than 20 cents over December's index levels, as below-normal temperatures covered the producing region and threatened to land in the Northeast late this week.</p>
<p>Temperatures are forecast to dip to levels about 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below-normal by Wednesday in the Midwest and southern plains, moving eastward by the end of the week.  </p>
<p>In the market areas, New York city-gate prices jumped into the $4.40-4.60 range, up more than 30 cents from Friday, with the higher-priced deals surfacing late.</p>
<p>The New York Power Authority's 832 megawatt (MW) Fitzpatrick nuclear power unit was shut this weekend for repairs.</p>
<p>In congruence with the New York market, Appalachian prices gained about 45 cents to the $4.20s early and the $4.40s late.</p>
<p>As the arctic blast moved eastward, the Midcontinent market braced itself for bitterly cold by midweek, causing prices to rise by at least 50 cents to the $4.00-4.10 area.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the region are expected to fall to 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below-normal by Wednesday, with the cold weather continuing into at least early next week.</p>
<p>With storage levels well below normal, buyers in the Midwest are forced to rely on the spot market to meet heating demand, which is resulting in the converging Gulf and Midcontinent markets.</p>
<p>American Gas Association reported last Wednesday that working gas stocks in the producing region were at 61 percent of capacity.</p>
<p>In west Texas, where temperatures are forecast to dip to 20-30 degrees F below-normal Tuesday through Friday, Permian gas prices surged well past the $4 mark early, with deals reported done anywhere from $4.00 to $4.22, up more than 70 cents from Friday's levels and up at least 50 cents from December indices.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southwest are forecast to slip to four to eight degrees below-normal Tuesday through the end of the week in the western half and as much as 15 degrees below-normal in the east.</p>
<p>Separately, Duke Power's 1,129 MW Catawba 2 nuclear power unit in South Carolina, shut this weekend, will likely not restart until early next week.</p>
<p>Also, Southern Co's 822 MW Farley 2 nuclear unit in Alabama, shut this weekend, is expected to restart Tuesday.</p>
<p>Entergy's 858 MW Arkansas 2 nuclear unit will likely return to the grid Tuesday.</p>
<p>Virginia Power's 781 MW Surry 2 nuclear power unit in Gravel Neck, Va., remained off line after tripping off line Friday. The company said the unit would likely restart December 21.</p>
