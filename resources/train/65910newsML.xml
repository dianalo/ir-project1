<headline>In North Korea, smiles turn to snarls.</headline>

<p>Cordial one day, bellicose the next, North Korea's recent success in reaching out to overseas investors has suddenly been overshadowed by a deadly infiltration drama.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Pyongyang officials were sweet-talking businessmen in the Rajin-Sonbong free trade zone. The visitors were charmed; Pyongyang snagged deals worth $840 million.</p>
<p>But by Wednesday the cheerful smiles were gone.</p>
<p>An espionage submarine dropped a group of heavily armed Pyongyang agents on a South Korean beach in a haunting throwback to the Cold War.</p>
<p>Businessmen who thought detente had arrived were given a jolting reminder of the perils still lurking in the world's last Stalinist state.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's abrupt mood swings are often put down to warring factions within the communist leadership.</p>
<p>Sabre-rattling often follows peace overtures as security hawks counter reform-minded colleages in the foreign affairs and trade bureaucracies, North Korea watchers in Seoul say.</p>
<p>Provocations play into the hands of hardliners in Seoul equally determined to fan tensions between the enemy states.</p>
<p>Security scares in April when Pyongyang troops staged exercises in a border buffer zone prompted a peace overture by South Korea President Kim Young-sam and his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Since then, North Korea has appeared more conciliatory, although it has not responded to an offer of four-way peace talks that would also include China.</p>
<p>This month, U.S. negotiators in New York reported progress implementing an accord under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its suspected development of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>And, in a surprise concession, Pyongyang suggested it would open its skies to overflights by world airlines next month.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Pyongyang seemed ready kiss and make up with South Korea after a row over invitations to the Rajin-Sonbong investment forum led to a Seoul boycott. A faxed message to South Korean foreign minister Gong Ro-myung invited a southern delegation for an exclusive look around.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, Pyongyang seemed to have changed its mind again. Its official Korea Central News Agency called reports of the invitation a &quot;groundless rumour&quot; floated for a &quot;foolish political purpose&quot;.</p>
<p>Wednesday's submarine drama adds to pressure on President Kim to take a tough line on North Korea. Kim, a former dissident leader, is vulnerable to rightwing attacks that he does not take the &quot;Red threat&quot; seriously enough.</p>
<p>A heavy handed crackdown on pro-Pyongyang students now underway is widely seen in South Korea as at least partly a sop to rightwingers in Kim's ruling New Korea Party.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Seoul describe provocations such as the submarine infiltration as theatrical stunts, rather than serious security threats.</p>
<p>&quot;If they wanted to send spies to South Korea they could march them through the gates of Kimpo,&quot; said one Western envoy, referring to Seoul's international airport.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they harden feelings in South Korea that North Korea cannot be trusted, however hard it tries to promote its experiments with capitalism.</p>
