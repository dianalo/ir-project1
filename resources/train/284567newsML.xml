<p>New car sales in France were up 1.8 percent in December at 144,735 units, but were down three percent on a comparable-day basis from December 1995 levels, the French carmakers association CCFA said on Thursday.</p>
<p>For all of 1996, car sales in France were up 10.5 percent over the previous year at 2.13 million, the highest figure since 1992, a CCFA spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The market was underpinned by a state-sponsored incentive scheme that ran for a year to the end of September 1996.</p>
<p>The CCFA is expected to send details in a statement shortly.</p>
<p>Car sales were disrupted in December 1995, registering a 15 percent fall from the prior year level, because of a public transport workers' strike, the CCFA said in its statement.</p>
<p>It said the French carmakers' share of the market was 54.3 percent in December 1996, up from 52.2 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p>But their combined share for the year as a whole fell to 56 percent from 59.4 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>The PSA Peugeot Citroen group's share was 29.4 percent in 1996 and Renault SA's share was 26.6 percent.</p>
