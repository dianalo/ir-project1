<p>Slovak interbank rates rose slightly in moderate trading on Monday as the central bank added less crown liquidity than it drained from the market through repo tender operations.</p>
<p>One-day funds remained the most traded maturity with rates rising to around 28 percent from opening at around 26.</p>
<p>The central bank (NBS) on Monday added market liquidity of 4.0 billion crowns through a one-week repo tender, at an average rate of 17.43 percent, while at the same time at least 7.0 billion crowns left the market in maturing one-week repos.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't much the market can do with the rates at the moment, it's all in the NBS hands which keeps tight control over the liquidity through some 10 billion crowns extended in short-tern repo tenders,&quot; said Rastislav Zivor of ING Bank</p>
<p>Dealers said rates should go further up ahead of the end of the minimum reserves requirement (PMR) period on Thursday, predicting a ceiling for the increase at around 30 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I see the rates climbing higher, to some 30 percent by the end of the PMR period, as the market will remain slightly short and banks will try to meet their PMR,&quot; said Dalibor Cernicka, head of the Bratislava-based Money Market Broker.</p>
<p>According to NBS figures, as of July 28 the banking sector lacked some 0.77 percent of cumulative funds needed to meet PMR on July 31.</p>
<p>Cernicka expects the new two-week PMR period to start with rates at around 27 percent on Friday, saying a decline to under 20 percent was unlikey over the next two months.</p>
<p>&quot;State budget development will force the finance ministry to continue accepting high yields in state securities auctions which will keep interbank rates high,&quot; Cernicka said.</p>
<p>Last week, the ministry accepted an average tax-free yield of 18.196 percent in an auction of its three-week treasury bills.</p>
<p>Average yield in an auction of one-year state bonds last Tuesday rose to 17.8 percent from 16.8 percent on July 8.</p>
