<p>With no major economic data scheduled, the main event for the U.S. fixed income markets on Tuesday will be the announcement after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting (FOMC), expected at 1415 EDT/1815 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;It's probably going to be very quiet until (1415 EDT),&quot; said Chris Rupkey, financial economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi. &quot;Although on the last couple of FOMC days we have made a move.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts are divided in their forecasts but the market is slightly biased towards a steady Fed policy, experts said.  </p>
<p>With June fed funds futures priced at just 10 basis points over the current 5-1/2 percent target rate, the contract implies there is a 40-percent chance Fed policymakers will move on Tuesday and a 60-percent chance they won't, said James Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is kind of leaning in the direction the Fed won't change rates, so obviously if they don't, rates will come down a little bit in the front end,&quot; Glassman said.  </p>
<p>Wall Street is split nearly down the middle about the outcome of the Fed's deliberations, with a slight majority forecasting no change in monetary policy, according to a Reuters poll released on Monday.</p>
<p>Of the 39 primary dealers surveyed, 21 expect the Fed to hold rates steady, while 18 forecast a quarter point rise in the funds rate to 5.75 percent.</p>
<p>Of those firms expecting a hike, three looked for at least a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate as well.  </p>
<p>The two-year note, yielding around 6.26 percent, is priced an unusually tight 76 basis points over the federal funds rate. This compares with a 120-basis-point spread in past years when a rate hike was anticipated, Rupkey said.</p>
<p>If the Fed does tighten the two-year could take it hard. The yield should rise 20 basis points or so, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would argue if the Fed goes, obviously you'll have a re-price of securities. You'll probably see a big flattening of the curve and you'll be back to 6.40 (percent) on the two-year very quickly,&quot; said Cary Leahey, senior economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the 30-year bond was in a solid uptrend. Many investors therefore expect the bond to do well no matter what the Fed's decision.</p>
<p>But much will depend on the wording of the statement at the conclusion of the meeting, analysts said.</p>
<p>If the Fed announces a rate hike and indicating such a move should be sufficient for a time, Rupkey said: &quot;That is going to help bonds to take off and possibly even help the short end or at least modererate the rise in two-year note yields that was expected.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the risk-reward is the market will probably do worse if they tightnen, at least on the front end. The back end (is in) its own little world,&quot; Leahey said.</p>
