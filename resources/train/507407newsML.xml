<p>Gatwick Express, the train operator owned by transport giant National Express Group Plc, on Monday announced a 100 million pound order for new trains with GEC-Alsthom's Metro-Cammell.</p>
<p>The deal marked the inaugural order for Metro-Cammell's new Juniper train rental and servicing business which was launched on Monday after 18 months of behind-the-scenes preparation.</p>
<p>Delivery will begin in December 1998 for the order of eight luxury trains with eight carriages and the entire fleet, servicing the Gatwick airport-London Victoria train station route, will be in operation by May 1999.</p>
<p>GEC's Juniper beat 20 other bidders to clinch the deal which includes the design, building and maintenance of the trains.</p>
<p>It will also help safeguard 1,800 long-term jobs at GEC-Alsthom's Birmingham plant in central England.</p>
<p>Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine welcomed the news at a London press briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;Rail privatisation has opened the way for new investment and better services. At last our railways are free to raise standards and put the customer first. Today's announcement from Gatwick Express is great news for British industry and British jobs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mac Mackintosh, managing director of Gatwick Express, told a news conference that the new train order meant the operator had seen its franchise term extended to 15 years from seven years.</p>
<p>He said the new models would replace existing 25-year-old trains from the Porterbrook train leasing company.</p>
<p>Mackintosh said GEC-Alsthom faced penalties if it failed to deliver on time.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some very stiff financial penalties if GEC fails to deliver on schedule so Gatwick Express won't be hurt,&quot; said Mackintosh.</p>
<p>He said the deal did not mean that GEC-Alsthom had sewn up the market for providing trains for other National Express rail operator companies, however.</p>
<p>But even so, the Gatwick Express contract marks a powerful debut for GEC-Alsthom's Juniper business.</p>
<p>Juniper is an electric multiple train unit  which has a series of flexible service options allowing rail operators to choose from a series of packages.</p>
<p>It offers maintenance and finance facilities as part of its range of services.</p>
<p>Peter Rigby, sales and marketing director of Metro-Cammell, told the press briefing that Juniper responded to &quot;significant new challenges&quot; thrown up by rail privatisation which allowed manufacturers greater involvement in the design of rolling stock.</p>
<p>He said under the new privatised regime train manufacturers had to &quot;respond to changes in demand more quickly, take on more responsibility and risk transfer and provide innovative financing for projects.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jupiter train is designed to go at a speed of between 120 and 160 kilometres an hour, with the scope to cover long suburban, inter-suburban and short intercity routes.</p>
<p>The new trains will cut the journey time to Gatwick from 30 minutes to 25 minutes and is capable of shaving off another five minutes if the track is upgraded.</p>
<p>Macintosh said the aim was to offer &quot;on-board service more like an airline&quot;.</p>
<p>But railway passenger pressure group Save Our Railways, remained unsatisfied. In a statement, it described post-privatisation investment in new trains as &quot;derisory&quot; and lagging behind the levels seen under the nationalised system.</p>
<p>Gatwick Express employs 290 people and carries around four million passengers a year, 75 percent of which are air travellers going to and from the international airport.</p>
