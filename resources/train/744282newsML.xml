<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan state firm to set up branch in HK.</title>
<headline>Taiwan state firm to set up branch in HK.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-07-21</dateline>

<p>Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecommunication Corp said on Monday it would set up an office in Hong Kong on August 1.</p>
<p>The move would make Chunghwa Taiwan's first state-run firm to form a presence in Hong Kong since the former British colony's return to China on July 1.</p>
<p>Chunghwa said its branch would be a one-person liaison office that uses Hong Kong as a hub to seek investments in other Southeast Asian countries -- but not investments in Hong Kong or mainland China.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel it is better to seek telecom investments in Southeast Asian countries from Hong Kong because those countries traditionally have greater telecom links with Hong Kong than with Taipei,&quot; a Chunghwa spokesman told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Our office in Hong Kong will be a liaison office and will not be involved in operations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chunghwa said it was considering investments particularly in Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The spokesman, who declined to be named, said the state-run company would not seek to invest in mainland China because Taiwan's government has not lifted its ban on direct telecommunications with communist Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a state-run firm and we have to follow government polices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chunghwa in July began allowing customers to use their mobile telephones in China by adding the mainland to Taiwan's &quot;international roaming&quot; network.</p>
<p>But the company said its liberalisation did not amount to a lifting of the ban on cross-Strait direct links because all connections had to be routed through a third territory.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct connections with China since they split after a civil war in 1949. But Taipei has said it would allow Hong Kong to continue its function as a middleman between Taiwan and China after the July 1 handover.</p>
<p>Chunghwa said telecom investments in Hong Kong would be impractical because the market was already saturated.</p>
<p>&quot;There are already so many telecom companies with long-established operations in Hong Kong that even if we were authorised to invest, we would be killed,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
