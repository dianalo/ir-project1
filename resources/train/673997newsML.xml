<p>The U.S. trade deficit in April rose 7.8 percent to $8.4 billion as record exports were not enough to offset record imports, the Department of Commerce said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The department said exports, led by increased sales of telecommunications equipment, rose 0.2 percent to a record $78.36 billion in April. Imports, reflecting strong demand for clothes, toys, sporting goods and other consumer products, rose 0.9 percent to $86.72 billion, the department said.</p>
<p>The rise in the April trade deficit, from a revised $7.76 billion gap in March, was well below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who were looking for a $10 billion trade gap in the month.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports are showing considerable strength, which is particularly good news in the face of a strong dollar,&quot; said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Barnett Bank Inc. &quot;It indicates the improvement in various countries throughout the world and that U.S productivity is allowing good export performance.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. trade deficit with China jumped 33.3 percent to $3.45 billion in April, up from $2.59 billion in March, the department said. The deficit with Japan widened by 5.1 percent in April to $4.84 billion, compared with $4.61 billion in March. The department said it was the highest trade gap with Japan since an October 1996 deficit of $4.9 billion.</p>
<p>The trade deficit with Canada dropped by 26.3 percent in April to $970 million, the lowest monthly U.S. deficit with Canada since March 1995. The U.S. deficit with Mexico shrank by 5.2 percent in April to $1.4 billion, the department said.</p>
<p>The United States recorded a $486 million trade deficit with Western Europe in April after enjoying a $320 million surplus in March. In the first four months of the year, the United States has had a cumulative $1.15 billion shortfall in trade with struggling Western European economies.</p>
<p>The United States typically runs a surplus on its trade with other countries in services like travel and tourism that partly offsets big merchandise trade deficits.</p>
<p>The merchandise trade gap rose 1.6 percent in April to $15.11 billion, while the services surplus fell 5.2 percent to $6.75 billion from $7.12 billion, the department said.</p>
