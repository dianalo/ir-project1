<p>Urologix Inc Chief Executive Officer Jack Meyer said Wednesday the company expected Japanese regulators to approve its T3 System for the treatment of enlarged prostates by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ministry of Health and Welfare's panel has recommended approval,&quot; Meyer said during the company's annual shareholder meeting. &quot;We expect to have MHW approval by the end of this calendar year.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts had expected the approval by the end of 1996 or in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The company also said it would apply for pre-marketing approval of the treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company had previously said it would file with the FDA by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Some analysts had expressed concerns that the delay was caused by the quality of the company's data. Meyer denied that.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no issue with the quality of our data,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;The delay is being caused primarily by the time it's taken to compile, assess and send out the data for review.&quot;</p>
<p>Meyer said the company's gross margins would improve over time. &quot;Long term, our gross margins will be representative of what is achieved in the medical device industry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company had a gross loss of $815,000 in its fiscal year ended in June 30.</p>
<p>Urologix shares were down 1-1/32 to 14-3/4 in Nasdaq trading at 1400 EST/1900 GMT Wednesday.</p>
