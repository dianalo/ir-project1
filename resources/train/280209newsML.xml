<headline>U.S. denies sponsoring anti-Nigeria groups.</headline>
<dateline>LAGOS 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States said on Monday it was not true that it was sponsoring groups opposed to Nigeria's military government as alleged by the African nation.</p>
<p>Ambassador Walter Carrington told a new conference in Lagos: &quot;We have a programme of interaction with a wide range of people in Nigeria which is open and above board.&quot;</p>
<p>Carrington was summonned to the capital Abuja on Christmas Eve by Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, who protested over a warning by Washington the week before that there could be bomb attacks at Nigerian airports in the last two weeks of December.</p>
<p>Ikimi said the statement with expected dates of the blasts suggested Washington possessed information that should have been shared with Nigeria.</p>
<p>But Carrington said the U.S. government had no specific information of any planned blasts and that the December 17 statement was based on events in Nigeria and heightened security at airports. The public announcement by the U.S. State Department also urged U.S. citizens in Nigeria to be cautious.</p>
<p>The following day more than a dozen Nigerian soldiers were wounded when a bomb ripped apart a bus filled with troops.</p>
<p>&quot;The warning issued to U.S. citizens on December 17 concerning the possibility of further bombings in Lagos was intended solely to protect Americans resident in or planning to travel to Nigeria,&quot; Carrington said.</p>
<p>Nigeria's relations with the United States, the biggest buyer of its main export crude oil, have been strained since the army annulled a presidential poll in 1993 to restore civil rule.</p>
<p>The situation worsened last year when General Sani Abacha's government defied international opinion and executed nine minority rights activists for murder.</p>
<p>A day after Carrington's meeting with Ikimi, another Nigerian cabinet minister, Wada Nas, told reporters that a U.S. national had met secretly with Nigerian opposition groups and promised them funds to hold anti-government rallies.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not sponsor anti-government activities,&quot; Carrington said.</p>
