<p>The key June 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract is expected to test the downside on Thursday, retaining weakness from LIFFE overnight.</p>
<p>The market will be closely watching industrial output data for April and forecasts for May and June, due at 1.30 p.m. (0430 GMT), traders said.</p>
<p>The primary focus will be on the forecast for production in June, which is expected to come in at around minus one, said a trader for a trust bank's securities unit.</p>
<p>If the forecast for June is substantially stronger, JGBs are likely to be sold, the trader said.  </p>
<p>The market's view of the economy is based on expectations of a slowdown in the April-June quarter due to the effects of the consumption tax rise, and a strong forecast for output in June may force the market to revise its thinking, the trader said.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters forecast rises in industrial output for April ranging from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent, compared with a month-on-month drop of 0.3 percent in March.</p>
<p>The market has already factored in a slight increase in output in April and a positive forecast for output in May, the trader for a trust bank's securities unit said.  </p>
<p>Lack of buying by investors has contributed to recent falls in the JGB market, a trader for a long-term credit bank said.</p>
<p>Investors have refrained from buying JGBs recently as they are not yet sure when the fall in JGBs will abate, he said.</p>
<p>The BOJ said late on Wednesday that it would release the results of its next &quot;tankan&quot; corporate sentiment survey on June 25, rather than in early July.</p>
<p>A BOJ spokesman said the decision to release the tankan earlier than previously planned did not indicate a change in the central bank's monetary policy.</p>
