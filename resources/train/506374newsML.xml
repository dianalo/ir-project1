<title>USA: U.S. corporate bond market awaits inflation report.</title>
<headline>U.S. corporate bond market awaits inflation report.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. corporate bond markets were quiet on Monday ahead of the release of the Consumer Price Index Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Spreads on investment grade corporates were unchanged to slightly wider on very low trading, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said spreads of long-maturity bonds in the media sector widened by two- to three-basis points in anticipation of posssible volatility on Tuesday. One high-grade trader predicted that &quot;If people sell something, they're going to sell dicier credits like Tele-Communications Inc, News Corp and Time Warner Inc.&quot;  </p>
<p>In a Reuters poll, U.S. economists expected a 0.2 percent rise in CPI and 0.3 percent rise in core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, for March.</p>
<p>In the high-yield market, trading was almost non-existent as most players attended an industry conference hosted by Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in Arizona.</p>
<p>But high-yield professionals expressed concern that a higher-than-expected CPI number tomorrow could extend the recent weakness in stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;A stock sell-off would further unsettle investors and could trigger a flight to quality,&quot; said one junk trader.  </p>
<p>That, he added, could cause a pickup in high-yield mutual fund outflows which have slowed in the most recent week.</p>
<p>In credit-specific news, junk bonds of Repap Wisconsin recovered much of their losses from Friday after the company announed it had secured access to additional financing in order to maintain enough liquidity to pay its creditors.</p>
<p>Stephen Larson, Repap's president and chief operating officer, told Reuters on Monday that a C$20 million increase in bank credit would be enough to meet bond and interest payments into the third quarter.  </p>
<p>Repap Wisconsin is a unit of Canadian pulp and paper company, Repap Enterprises Inc</p>
<p>In other markets, U.S. stocks mounted a late rally on Monday, pushing the closing Dow Jones industrial average higher by 60 points to 6452.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries ended the day slighly lower on fears of tomorrow's consumer inflation report. The 30-year benchmark Treasury dropped 1/32, ending the day at 93-10/32. The yield rose to 7.17 percent.</p>
