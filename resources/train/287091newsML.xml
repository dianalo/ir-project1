<p>California Gov. Pete Wilson asked for federal disaster aid on Friday after rain-gorged rivers broke their banks, flooding hundreds of homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response and recovery is beyond the capabilities of the state and local governments,&quot; Wilson wrote in a letter to President Bill Clinton asking him to issue a federal disaster declaration for 37 flood-ravaged California counties.</p>
<p>Wilson declared a state of emergency in 12 more northern and central California counties because of the floods, in addition to the 25 counties where he proclaimed an emergency on Thursday. The emergency proclamation now covers more than half of the state's 58 counties.</p>
<p>A federal disaster declaration would allow California flood victims to apply for temporary housing assistance, Small Business Administration disaster loans and disaster unemployment insurance, among other benefits.</p>
<p>Wilson also asked for a disaster recovery grant of $25 million from the U.S. Department of Labor to create temporary jobs for flood cleanup. He said the storms killed two people in California and that 25,000 evacuees were staying in shelters.</p>
<p>Clinton on Friday made federal disaster relief aid available to several areas of Nevada to help them recover from the storms. Clinton's action made federal funding available to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Douglas, Lyon, Storey and Washoe counties and in Carson City.</p>
<p>Washington state has declared emergencies in 24 counties and Oregon has declared emergencies in six counties.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the 900 tourists stranded in California's Yosemite National Park for two days were able to drive out of the park in their own cars on Friday as flooded rivers that had cut off roads receded, a park spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>With sewers in Yosemite Valley shut down and water supplies low, park officials had considered evacuating the tourists by military helicopters, but conditions improved enough to make that unnecessary.</p>
<p>&quot;In the end, they decided the water level was dropping sufficiently quickly to allow us to drive out,&quot; Reuters correspondent Alister Bull, who was vacationing at Yosemite, said after making it safely out of the scenic park, 150 miles (240 kms) southeast of San Francisco.</p>
<p>The worst hit area in California on Friday was along the Feather River, 50 miles (80 kms) north of Sacramento, where a swollen river burst through a levee, flooding 200 homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee.</p>
<p>Up to 3,000 residents of Modesto in central California were also evacuated as the Tuolumne River burst its banks, damaging homes, local officials said.</p>
<p>But clear skies over much of California and the Pacific Northwest brought a respite from a week of storms that have caused floods, mudslides and power outages, killed at least 18 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in five western states.</p>
<p>In California, authorities said 80,000 people had been evacuated from Yuba City, Marysville, Linda and Olivehurst along the Feather River, turning them into ghost towns.</p>
<p>Many residents left voluntarily over the last few days but authorities ordered tens of thousands out on Thursday night as levees showed signs of weakening and one eventually gave way.</p>
<p>&quot;It's enormous. I've never experienced anything like it,&quot; Bill Harris, a spokesman for the Yuba County Office of Emergency Services, said of the huge evacuation. He said there were no reports of deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>Some stranded residents had to be rescued by helicopter as millions of gallons (litres) of muddy water flowed through a 200-foot (60-metre) break in the levee.</p>
<p>So far none of the four towns has been flooded, but the water was moving toward Olivehurst, Harris said. He said officials planned to use trucks to dump boulders into the gap in the levee to try to slow the escaping water.</p>
<p>About 6,000 evacuees packed a shelter in the nearby town of Sutter. Parents sat on canvas cots while bored children raced around. &quot;This is kind of stressful. All I can think of is my family pictures,&quot; Florence Summers, 47, said, regretting leaving behind the photos in her Yuba City home.</p>
