<p>Taiwan's central bank, vowing to mop up excess liquidity before an upcoming holiday, issued T$3.0 billion in 14-day negotiable certificates of deposit on Thursday at an average yield of 5.914 percent.</p>
<p>The range of the bids was between 5.850 and 5.970 percent, a central bank official said. Demand totalled T$8 billion.</p>
<p>The issue was the central bank's second mop-up measure in two days.</p>
<p>The bank said Wednesday's issue aimed to absorb extra money before the upcoming two-day holiday on March 29-30 and was not an effort to dampen stock market turnover.  </p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong on Monday pledged that the bank would take the economy's health into consideration in any further issues of the short-term instruments.</p>
<p>The central bank had made major daily NCD issues almost every day up until March 21, reportedly trying to curb the loose liquidity that many analysts said was fuelling a stock market rally.</p>
<p>Since then share prices had plunged over a hog epidemic sweeping the island. Shares rebounded again on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
