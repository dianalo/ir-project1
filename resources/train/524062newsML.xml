<p>NWE gasoline was propelled higher by sharp gains in crude and unleaded futures on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges were talked around $191/193 for prompt delivery and were done at $192, while May delivery was talked at $195/$197 and traded at $194 and $195.</p>
<p>May Eurograde swaps were around $197/$198 fob ARA, while June swaps were at $193.50/$194.50. Regular barges traded at $189 for first half May delivery and $186 for prompt material.</p>
<p>On the cargo front, premium unleaded was assessed at $196/$197 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Traders attributed higher prices to surging crude and unleaded futures. May gasoline was trading 1.26 cents at 62.75 cents a gallon at 1713 GMT, while June was 1.16 cents higher at 62.10 cents.</p>
<p>Traders said the arbitrage door to the United States remained shut for smaller cargoes although bigger 60,000 tonne crossings could be just about worthwhile.</p>
<p>Shipbrokers reported GE Warren chartered a 60,000 tonne vessel to carry unleaded gasoline from East coast Britain to the U.S. Atlantic coast loading May 4, at a rate of W180.</p>
