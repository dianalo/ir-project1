<p>The 19th Franco-African summit opens on Wednesday in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, with three of its participants virtually at war in a worsening conflict in central Africa's Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>French officials say they want the three-day summit, held every two years alternatively in France and Africa, to focus on sound democratic government and economic management, the motto Paris has set for relations with its former African colonies.</p>
<p>But they will be hard-pressed to keep the turmoil in central Africa off the agenda, as Rwanda and Uganda are virtually at war with Zaire and fierce fighting is raging in Burundi between government forces and Hutu rebels. Further north, the Central African Republic is mired in its third army mutiny this year.</p>
<p>In several French-speaking states, military coups or revolts have undermined the democratic gains of the early 1990s.</p>
<p>And France's influence in Africa faces a challenge from the United States, which recently vetoed U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's French-backed bid for a second term.</p>
<p>Rwanda backed rebels who took over the Kivu region of east Zaire and are pushing further into Zaire. Kinshasa has accused Uganda of a border attack in the same Great Lakes region, while Uganda says it is fighting rebels equipped by Zaire.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes conflict, and the protracted debate on a multinational force to help get relief to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting, have highlighted France's waning role as the gendarme of Africa.</p>
<p>Criticism of its 1994 intervention in eastern Zaire and Rwanda to stop ethnic massacres -- and its previous support for a Hutu-dominated Rwandan government -- has induced France to caution.</p>
<p>While campaigning actively for the multinational force to be set up, President Jacques Chirac said the age of unilateral French interventions was over.</p>
<p>&quot;This type of intervention is no longer accepted by African states,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Faced with opposition from Rwanda and Zairean rebels to full-scale intervention, and from Zaire to mere food airdrops, the force organisers have yet to decide on a course of action.</p>
<p>French troops have also taken a lower profile in the latest strife in the Central African Republic, avoiding a repeat of their full-scale intervention against army mutineers in April to prop up President Ange Patasse.</p>
<p>Another issue likely to be raised in informal talks is the succession to Boutros-Ghali, a Francophile Egyptian. The Security Council has agreed to give priority to candidates from Africa and France is insisting on a fluent French speaker.</p>
<p>The Ouagadougou summit, attended by more than 40 African countries, not all former French colonies, may shed light on Paris's hand in what is becoming a Franco-American poker game.</p>
<p>The meeting will be Chirac's first Franco-African summit since he took office 19 months ago, although he attended a summit of French-speaking countries in Cotonou last year and has visited Africa twice on regional tours as president.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed Africa lover, he is expected to repeat the message he conveyed last year on a whirlwind tour of West Africa -- that France is committed to supporting Africa but will demand good governance and economic rigour.</p>
<p>As France enforces austerity to qualify for a planned single European currency, aid is not as freely available as it once was. Paris will help countries that follow reform programmes prescribed by the International Monetary Fund to build a market economy and attractive conditions for investors.</p>
<p>Following a shock 50 percent devaluation in 1994 of the CFA franc, which is linked to the French franc, Chirac will also need to clarify the future status of the West African currency when the European single currency comes into effect.</p>
