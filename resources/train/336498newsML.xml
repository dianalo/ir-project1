<p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals unit of Rhone-Poulenc, said on Monday its 1996 net attributable income rose by 25 percent to $428.7 million while its earings per share were up at $3.16.</p>
<p>The company said that the earnings would have been higher but for the costs of an albumin product recall at the Centeon LCC joint venture with Hoechst of Germany.</p>
<p>Centeon restarted its production on January 24 after an October 10 product recall for a potential risk of bacterial infection. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said the 1996 costs of the recall were $0.44 per share.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite this problem, which will also have an impact in 1997, I believe that the growth potential of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer has significantly improved in 1996,&quot; chairman and chief executive Michel de Rosen said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We have generated synergies from the integration of Fisons. These synergies will be more significant in 1997 -- they will be more than $200 million,&quot; finance director Patrick Langlois said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have surpassed our of objective $750 million in asset sales to reach an amount of more than $850 million at the end of 1996,&quot; he added, saying this had allowed the company to cut debt to $2.38 billion at the end of the year against more than $3.0 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Sales were up to $5.420 billion from $5.316 billion with a 36 percent rise in sales of the Lovenox/Clexane anti-thrombosis drug to over $400 million.</p>
<p>Cancer drug Taxotere, launched in the U.S. and Europe in the second quarter, had sales of about $90 million.</p>
