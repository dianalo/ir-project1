<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss government cuts spending plans for 1997.</title>
<headline>Swiss government cuts spending plans for 1997.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Swiss government said it has made cuts in planned spending for 1997 to keep federal expenditures at the 1996 level of about 44 billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p>The reductions would mean expenditures about 1.34 billion francs below the projected level of 45.33 billion for 1997.</p>
<p>Current budget expenditures for 1996 are projected at 43.97 billion francs. The latest measures are part of a plan to achieve a balanced budget by 2001.</p>
<p>The Swiss cabinet said in a statement it had frozen 1997 spending at the current year's level. The goal would be achieved &quot;with the help of hard savings measures.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swiss government said the overall deficit for 1997 would be around 5.5 billion francs. The budget deficit for 1996 was projected at 4.0 billion francs, but the government is now expecting a deficit of around 5.0 billion francs.</p>
<p>The new savings measures include postponing contributions to state pension funds. The Swiss government is also looking towards an increase in the value-added tax, currently at 6.5 percent. A government spokesman said the increase would not likely take place in the current year, or in 1997.</p>
<p>The government also said it was reducing unemployment compensation, putting a cap on spending for military and aid to developing countries, and cutting spending on government personnel. It will make reductions in other subsidies for the environment, forestry, energy, housing subsidies, culture, sport, health, prison spending and some other areas.</p>
<p>The Swiss Federal Cabinet is also recommending a freeze on new spending unless Swiss gross domestic product growth slows in the coming year.</p>
