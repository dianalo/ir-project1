<p>Germany's largest state North Rhine-Wesphalia deported 25 Bosnians on Tuesday, a spokesman for the regional government in Duesseldorf said.</p>
<p>Included in the group were 10 single Bosnians or married people without children. Their involuntary departure marked the first time that the state had deported a group of Bosnian refugees not previously convicted of any crimes in Germany.</p>
<p>A group of 16 convicted criminals were sent home from the state in April and another eight convicts were deported on Tuesday, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Seven other Bosnians who had arrived in Germany after the 1995 Dayton peace agreement were also sent back to Bosnia on Tuesday on a plane bound for Sarajevo.</p>
<p>The refugees were deported as part of an agreement between Bonn and Germany's 16 states that if the refugees failed to return to Bosnian voluntarily, they eventually faced forced repatriation.</p>
<p>With memories of World War Two still poignant, Germans welcomed the refugees with open arms taking in some 320,000 -- more than the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p>But facing record unemployment and economic decline at home, Germans started to complain the Bosnians were becoming a burden on increasingly tight state finances.</p>
<p>Refugee agencies have criticised Germany's policy of forced repatriation, arguing that most returnees ended up in refugee camps in the chaotic aftermath of the 1992-95 war.</p>
<p>The state government spokesman said about 9,000 of 66,000 Bosnian refugees who took shelter in North Rhine-Westphalia had already volunteered to return to Bosnia. About 20,000 Bosnians across Germany have returned home of their own accord.</p>
<p>The southern state of Bavaria and the northern state of Berlin, both of which are led by conservative parties, have already deported scores of Bosnians. North Rhine-Westphalia is governed by the left-leaning Social Democrats.</p>
