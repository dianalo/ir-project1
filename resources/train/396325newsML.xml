<p>Four young French women whose bodies were found buried on a Channel beach were strangled and apparently raped, a lawyer for the relatives said on Saturday.</p>
<p>A state prosecutor asked an investigating magistrate to formally place two scrap merchant brothers under investigation on suspicion of murder and rape.</p>
<p>Peggy, 20, and her 17-year-old sister Amelie, Isabelle 20, and her sister Audrey, 17, had gone missing 11 days ago during a carnival evening in the northern port of Boulogne.</p>
<p>Lawyer Blandine Lejeune said investigators were trying to establish how two men could have kidnapped, raped and strangled the four women.</p>
<p>The killings shocked the country. &quot;Slaughtered&quot;, the popular daily France-Soir screamed in a banner headline. The tabloid Le Parisien published the names of the four girls on a black frontpage recalling a death notice.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Gerald Lesigne named the suspects as Jean-Louis Jourdain, 37 and his brother Jean-Michel, 34.</p>
<p>The young womens' bodies were concealed at the base of a concrete blockhouse built by German forces during World War Two outside the village of Portel, near Boulogne.</p>
<p>The women were wearing fancy carnival dresses when they disappeared late in the early hours of February 12. Police said they were apparently killed on the following evening. Their surnames have not been released.</p>
<p>From Bucharest, where he is on an official visit, French President Jacques Chirac has sent a message of sympathy to the womens' families. &quot;I am horrified and stunned by this act of savagery.</p>
<p>&quot;I think of these young girls, children, innocent victims, I think of their parents and their distress. Justice will be done,&quot; he said in a message broadcast by television on Friday evening.</p>
