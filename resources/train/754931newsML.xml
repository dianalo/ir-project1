<title>NEW ZEALAND: Bougainville rebels release five PNG soldiers.</title>

<p>Bougainville rebels have released five Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) soldiers held hostage since September 1996, New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted to announce that the five Papua New Guinea Defence Force soldiers who have been held hostage by Bougainville forces have been released,&quot; McKinnon said in a press statement.</p>
<p>Thousands have died in a nine-year secessionist conflict on Bougainville between local rebels and Papua New Guinea forces.</p>
<p>The five soldiers were handed over on board the New Zealand frigate Canterbury, lying off Bougainville, in the presence of a representative of the PNGDF, the statement said.</p>
<p>According to the New Zealand Press Association, the handover took place early on Thursday and a day later than originally expected.</p>
<p>New Zealand has just hosted two weeks of talks at Burnham military camp near Christchurch between 70 representatives of local parties in the fighting at which they agreed on a joint approach to the Papua New Guinea government in future peace negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;This move came out of the two weeks of meetings in Burnham and shows very clearly the common wish for peace among the Bougainvillean factions. It gives me great hope for the future,&quot; said McKinnon, who was instrumental in arranging the talks.</p>
<p>The move followed an announcement from the paramilitary Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) earlier this week that it had decided to release the soldiers, which it called prisoners of war, from captivity in South Bougainville.</p>
<p>This showed its &quot;goodwill to the people of Papua New Guinea&quot;, BRA said.</p>
<p>Canterbury and the naval supply ship Endeavour are returning delegates from the BRA and its political wing, the Bougainville Interim Government, to the island.</p>
<p>The ships collected them from the Solomon Islands where they had been flown from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, delegates from the Papua New Guinea-backed Bougainville Transitional Government have been returned to their stronghold on the offshore island of Buka by the New Zealand air force.</p>
<p>New Zealand opted to play a direct role in helping all the participants back to the islands because it wanted to ensure safe passage in the absence of a formal ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Wellington was concerned to avoid the repetition of an incident in late 1995 when PNG defence forces ambushed a rebel delegation returning from similar talks in Cairns, Australia.</p>
<p>McKinnon, now in Lombok, Indonesia, is due to meet representatives of the Port Moresby government in Kuala Lumpur at the regional forum of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) next week.</p>
<p>He has said he will encourage the new Papua New Guinea government &quot;to see the very positive aspect to and conclusion of the talks.&quot;</p>
