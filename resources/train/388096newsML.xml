<p>Vietnam is sending a military delegation to the United States in a step toward possible future strategic cooperation between old enemies, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam retains a large military that is in the midst of a modernisation effort,&quot; the Pentagon said in announcing the visit this month of six senior colonels from the Vietnamese Defence Ministry's external relations department. &quot;There's a natural basis for exploratory discussions regarding strategic issues of mutual interest.&quot;</p>
<p>Vietnamese diplomats said the delegation, scheduled to visit Hawaii and Washington, would be led by Colonel Vu Tan, head of the defence ministry's external relations department.</p>
<p>Previous Vietnamese military visits have dealt almost exclusively with the more than 2,100 U.S. servicemen still listed as missing in action or otherwise unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, 1,594 of them in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Unanswered questions about the fate of some of those men have cast a pall over U.S.-Vietnamese ties since Communist-led forces overran the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975.</p>
<p>The agenda for the coming visit, while still featuring the missing in action (MIA) issue, is being broadened as part of a process of developing military to military relations between the United States and Vietnam, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The visit is part of a modest effort to begin discussions with the Vietnamese regarding the shape (of) contacts between our defence establishments,&quot; Army Lt. Col. Donna Boltz, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said.</p>
<p>In Hawaii, the delegation will be hosted by the commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Jospeh Prueher, and will visit the facilities of the U.S. Joint Task Force for Full Accounting which is in charge of efforts to trace MIAs.</p>
<p>In Washington, the host will be Kurt Campbell, a deputy assistant secretary of defence who led a U.S. inter-agency team to Vietnam last October to begin military-to-military talks, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>It said getting the fullest possible accounting for missing Americans &quot;remains the U.S. government's top priority in regard to Vietnam.&quot;</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton normalised diplomatic relations with Vietnam in July 1995. Douglas &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson, a former prisoner of war nominated to be the first U.S. ambassador to Hanoi, is expected to arrive there next month if confirmed, as expected, by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>A key talking point in military-to-military talks is expected to be U.S. Navy interest in port calls to show the flag, partly as a counterweight to China's growing military might in the region.</p>
<p>David Brown, who oversaw regional and security policy in the State Department's East Asia bureau from 1993 to 1995, predicted that the expansion of military ties would be a slow process.</p>
<p>He said the short-term goal probably was to arrange no more than one or two port calls a year, not to turn any Vietnamese port into a &quot;rest and recreation&quot; spot comparable to Hong Kong, which has played host to 60 to 80 U.S. port calls in recent years and reverts to Chinese control at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>A port call to Vietnam would be the first since U.S. warships operated from the giant wartime naval installation at Cam Ranh Bay. The possibility of using Cam Ranh Bay has interested U.S. military planners since Washington lost access to Subic Bay Naval Station in the Philippines in 1992.</p>
