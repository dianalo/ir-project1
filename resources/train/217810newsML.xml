<p>Indian soymeal export prices fell nearly four dollars per tonne during the past week on limited export demand, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said Indian soymeal was currently quoted at $275-276 rupees per tonne fas against $278-280 rupees last week. It was quoted at around $216-218 rupees per tonne during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Traders expect a soybean crop of 3.5 million tonnes, of which 500,000 tonnes will be set aside for sowing in the next season.</p>
<p>About 2.4 million tonnes of soymeal will be produced from the remainder of the crop.</p>
<p>Of this 400,000 tonnes would be consumed domestically.</p>
<p>The remaining two million tonnes would be available for export in the new season, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said Indian soymeal exporters had so far signed contracts to export around 1.3 million tonnes in 1996/97 (November-October) season compared to 1.5 million last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have 700,000 tonnes more (soymeal) available for export,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>India exported nearly 2.2 million tonnes of soymeal in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Indian soybean is currently quoted at 10,400-10,700 rupees per tonne compared to 8,300-8,600 rupees at the same time last year. In plant delivery condition, it was quoted at around 10,500-10,850 compared with 8,700-8,800 per tonne in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Soybean arrivals are around 15,000 tonnes each day compared with 20,000 tonnes last year in the markets of central India, the hub of India's soybean industry.</p>
