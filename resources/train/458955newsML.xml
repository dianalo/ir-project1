<headline>Chile sees progress in Mexico free trade talks.</headline>

<p>Chile is confident that talks on expanding a free trade agreement with Mexico will make rapid progress, despite a recent spat over imported televisions, said Chilean trade negotiator Alejandro Jara.</p>
<p>&quot;With Mexico we have proved we have a very good understanding...which has helped us advance rapidly,&quot; Jara told a news conference.</p>
<p>Representatives from the two countries will hold a new round of trade talks from April 29 to May 1, he said.  </p>
<p>Chile signed a free trade agreement with Mexico in the early 1990s and last year wrapped up a trade pact with Canada.</p>
<p>Valdes said the talks with Mexico are overcoming several problem areas, including intellectual property, government purchases and access to markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't speak ahead of the results, but in a week of discussion we have made important advances and could reach an agreement soon,&quot; said Valdes.</p>
<p>Chilean customs are carrying out an investigation into claims that Mexican televisions do not comply with rules of origin established in the agreement.</p>
<p>Chile has complained that televisions imported from Mexico included a high percentage of imported components.</p>
<p>((-- Marco Sibaja, Santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595x212))  </p>
<p>Juan Gabriel Valdes, director of international economic relations at the foreign ministry, said discussions on investment and services have moved ahead quickly.</p>
<p>Talks on these issues have been based on the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which groups Mexico, Canada and the United States, said Valdes.</p>
<p>Chile has been trying to join the bloc for over two years after receiving an invitation at the Summit of Americas in Miami in December 1994.  But political difficulties in Washington have meant the talks have made little progress.</p>
