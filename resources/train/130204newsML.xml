<p>Chechen rebel leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev said on Monday he was sorry Alexander Lebed had been sacked as Moscow's envoy to Chechnya but that he was ready to work with his successor, Ivan Rybkin.</p>
<p>&quot;Rybkin and Lebed are different people but we won't link the results of the peace process with personalities,&quot; Yandarbiyev said in an interview with NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>He said Lebed's sacking last Thursday was Russia's internal affair but added: &quot;We express our regret that Lebed was not given the chance to finish what he had started.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed's dismissal by Russian President Boris Yeltsin prompted fears that a peace agreement which he signed with the separatists on August 31 could fall apart and that fighting which has killed tens of thousands of people could resume.</p>
<p>Rybkin, 50, took over from Lebed on Saturday as Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya and as secretary of Russia's Security Council, a group of defence, security and state officials which has taken many of the major decisions in the Chechen conflict.</p>
<p>Yandarbiyev reiterated the view of other rebel leaders that the peace process must go on. But he made clear it would not be easy to find a permanent solution to the conflict which flared when Moscow sent troops to Chechnya in December 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;There is much left to do, there are many unsolved problems (such as) the full withdrawal of Russian troops which must be carried out to the last soldier,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Most Russian troops are to withdraw from Chechnya under the agreement signed on August 31, local elections are to be held and a final settlement on how to define Chechnya -- in or out of Russia -- has been put off for five years.</p>
<p>The separatists want complete independence for their southern region but Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin again ruled this out on Monday.</p>
