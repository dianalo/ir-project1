<p>Israel's population grew 2.6 percent in 1996 to 5.764 million, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The growth rate was down from 2.7 percent in 1995 mainly due to a decline in immigration to approximately 69,000 people from 79,000 in 1995, the bureau said. Some 84 percent of all immigrants came from the countries that once comprised the Soviet Union, the same rate as the year before.</p>
<p>The bureau said immigration from the former Soviet Union totalled nearly 638,000 since 1990.</p>
<p>Jews made up 80.8 percent of Israel's population, Muslims 14.6 percent, Christians 2.9 percent and Druze 1.7 percent. The Jewish population grew by a slower 2.3 percent rate than the overall population and half of that was due to immigration, the bureau said.</p>
<p>The number of births reached 122,000, up four percent from 1995.</p>
