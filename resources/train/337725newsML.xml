<p>President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he had been assured by the Saudi government at &quot;the highest level&quot; that it would cooperate in investigating the bombing that killed 19 U.S. soldiers near Dhahran last year.</p>
<p>Clinton, asked about criticism by U.S. officials of Saudi cooperation, said at a news conference: &quot;I'm confident that in the end they will do what I have been assured personally by the highest levels of the Saudi government that they should do.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno said Saudi Arabia was frustrating U.S. efforts to determine responsibility for the June 25 bombing, saying Saudi Arabia had failed to provide answers to key questions.</p>
<p>&quot;The Saudi government has assured us at the very highest level that (the FBI) would get answers to those questions and so I expect that to happen,&quot; Clinton said at his first news conference since his second-term inauguration last week.</p>
<p>&quot;An investigation of this kind raises all kinds of complex questions about cooperation ... (versus Saudi) sovereignty, about what other interests of that nation might be in play,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We still have further requests for information ... We'll see how it comes out.&quot;</p>
<p>The Saudi Embassy released a statement on Friday from Ambassador Prince Bandar Bin Sultan saying close cooperation between officials from both countries would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always reached agreement on a broad and significant range of issues. Excellent working relations exist between officials of both countries at all levels. That close cooperation will continue,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Clinton also said that after last year's bombing, and an attack in 1995 that killed five Americans in Riyadh, security had been stepped up considerably to protect the 35,000 U.S. personnel in the kingdom.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no such thing as a risk-free world,&quot; he said, but after the considerable investment by Washington and the Saudis over the last year he felt the troops there were safer.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy in Riyadh last weekend issued a statement saying it continues to receive unconfirmed reports of possible attacks on U.S. interests in the kingdom and urging Americans to exercise extreme caution.</p>
<p>The warning was issued on an embassy emergency telephone line and dated January 25.</p>
