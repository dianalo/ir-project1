<title>USA: Blue-chip stocks post week's first higher finish.</title>
<headline>Blue-chip stocks post week's first higher finish.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks posted their first higher close of the week Thursday as bargain-hunters loaded up on recently battered shares and ignored a sell-off in bonds ahead of Friday's key jobs data for November.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 14.16 points at 6,437.10. In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,273 to 1,223 on active volume of 483 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds are selling off in anticipation of a strong jobs report after a tremendous amount of good news was absorbed,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors. &quot;Equities are gyrating after a tremendous run-up.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond plunged nearly 1-1/2 points, boosting its yield to 6.51 percent -- the highest since Nov. 8 -- from 6.40 percent at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;People are afraid of Friday's number,&quot; said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>In a Reuters survey, payroll growth of 180,000 jobs is widely expected, but a few expect the figure at 200,000 or more, a number that could support the view that the economy might pick up in the fourth quarter after slowing in the third.</p>
<p>The jump in long-term interest rates sparked selling in financial and other interest-rate sensitive stocks.</p>
<p>Major banks were especially hard-hit after their spectacular run-up this year. Citicorp shed 4-1/4 to 101-5/8, BankAmerica lost 3 to 96-1/2 and Wells Fargo was off 2-3/4 to 272-1/2.</p>
<p>But Sinai saw more good times for stocks. &quot;It's still a bull market. The economy still looks terrific. Interest rates, even if they go up some, it won't be by a lot and the markets will adjust to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Some retailers weakened after reporting disappointing November sales going into the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck slipped 1/4 to 49 after reporting its same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a year, fell 0.7 percent last month, and Gymboree slumped 4-5/8 to 23-1/8 on a 15 percent drop in November sales for the children's apparel retailer.</p>
<p>Dayton-Hudson rose 5/8 to 39-7/8 on a 1.3 percent gain in same-store sales.</p>
<p>Sunglass maker Oakley Inc shed 3-7/8 to 11-1/2 after forecasting below-consensus earnings due to further delays in orders from its key customer Sunglass Hut.</p>
<p>Sunglass Hut's stock fell 7/8 to 7-3/8 after its November same-store sales fell 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>Among other shares, Input/Output rose 2-5/8 to 18-3/4, rebounding from a 7-1/2 drop Wednesday on the company's earnings warning.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Pacific Gold surged 3 to 14-7/8 and Newmont Mining lost 3/8 to 47-1/8 after Newmont offered to acquire Santa Fe for $2 billion in a tax-free stock swap that would create the largest gold company in North America.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer rose 2-1/2 to 84-1/4 after brokerage house Deutsche Morgan Grenfell raised its fourth quarter 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates on the company.</p>
<p>Great Lakes Chemical lost 3 to 49-1/8, one day after it forecast flat 1997 results.</p>
<p>Anchor Gaming climbed 5 to 46 after retaining Morgan Stanley as financial adviser to review alternatives to boost shareholder value, including the possible sale or merger of the company.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index rose 3.10 points to 1,300.12.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 0.72 to 744.38. The American Stock Exchange index was up 1.04 to 590.03.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 0.48 to 392.75. The average share was down 5 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,219.200 down 0.529 or 0.01 percent.</p>
