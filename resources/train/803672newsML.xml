<p>Tokyo stocks closed moderately higher on Friday, as the yen's decline against the dollar invited buying in blue-chip exporters, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average gained 103.41 points, or 0.54 percent, to end at 19,326.03. It briefly climbed as high as 19,466.35. Its September futures were up 160 points at 19,440.</p>
<p>&quot;This much of a decline in the yen will not affect exporters fundamentally, but what is important is the trend backs up investors psychologically,&quot; said Mikio Takada, general manager at Nikko Securities Co Ltd.  </p>
<p>Towa's trading volume, at 8.266 million, was the third heaviest.</p>
<p>Towa's shares were hit by rumours that it is experiencing business difficulties. Officials at the firm were not available to comment on the rumours, due to a company holiday.</p>
<p>Shares in Fujita Corp, Towa's parent, hit a record low of 79 yen. They ended down 15 yen or 14.29 percent at 90 yen as the third-largest percentage loser. Fujita was the most actively traded issue, with a turnover of 13.79 million.</p>
<p>By sector, gainers were led by rubber, warehousing, pulp/paper, and miscellaneous manufacturing.  </p>
<p>The major losers were iron/steel, shipbuilding, gas, and construction.</p>
<p>The second section index ended 10.84 points higher at 1,680.12, with 6.61 million shares traded. The over-the-counter (OTC) index was down 7.39 points at 1,064.85.</p>
