<p>Bulgaria's economy is expected to post negative growth in 1997 but it should turn the corner in 1998, Bulgaria's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Bushkov said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't be able to overcome the problems of the last quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 so we still expect negative growth in 1997 but it will be nearing zero. But it will become positive in 1998,&quot; Bushkov said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Bushkov, who is attending a Central and Eastern European summit in Salzburg, said Bulgaria would like to test investor interest by issuing a eurobond but timing of such a deal had not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Asked about the country's future plans for a (Brady debt) debt buyback, Bushkov said: &quot;It depends very much on the whole climate and the possibility of issuing other debt instruments. We would continue to buyback but first we have to get stronger financially.&quot;</p>
<p>Bushkov said he was not sure when Bulgaria would approach the rating agencies for a credit rating. &quot;I don't know when we will ask for a credit rating,&quot; he said.</p>
