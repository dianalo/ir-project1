<p>Mexico will not waver from its current economic policy regardless of the outcome of key mid-term elections on July 6, a Finance Ministry official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the course of economic policy is defined,&quot; Manuel Ramos Francia, planning director for the Finance Ministry, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy will develop in a stable way and we expect that there won't be any unfavourable effects from the electoral situation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mexicans will elect all 500 members of the lower house of Congress, one-fourth of the Senate, six state governors and a mayor for Mexico City on July 6.</p>
<p>Some political analysts are predicting that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), in power since 1929, could lose its majority in Congress for the first time as the two main opposition parties gain strength.</p>
<p>Ramos Francia said if the PRI no longer controlled the Chamber of Deputies, as the lower house is known, there merely would be a greater level of debate, &quot;and I think that's healthy&quot;.</p>
<p>Even if the PRI were to lose its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it likely would remain the largest single party.</p>
<p>The two strongest challengers are the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), which has pledged to back responsible economic policies in the next Congress, and the economically and socially conservative National Action Party (PAN).</p>
