<p>A U.S. District Court judge heard the final day of testimony Friday on the proposed $4 billion merger of Staples and Office Depot, with experts battling over how it would affect consumer prices.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission asked the court to halt the merger, contending that if the two office superstore chains combine they will have power to raise prices on pencils, pens, toner cartridges and other consumbable office supplies.</p>
<p>The FTC did not include durable supplies such as furniture and office machinery and computers from its charges because it said there is enough competition in these products from other kinds of retailers.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas Hogan heard 30 hours of testimony spread over five days, including from the CEO and other officials of Staples, company rivals, customers, suppliers and a series of experts.</p>
<p>The judge plans to hear closing arguments starting at 9:30 a.m. EDT (1330 GMT) June 5, after the two sides have had a chance to submit further written arguments. He has said he will rule by mid-June on whether to grant a preliminary injunction against the merger.</p>
<p>The experts took center stage Friday. Specialists in the esoteric art of econometrics, a branch of economics, attempted to quantify what would happen if the two chains merged.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger will lead to 2.2 percent lower prices overall in all stores and all products,&quot; testified Jerry Hausman, an economist from MIT and hired by the office superstores.</p>
<p>Not so, said the government's experts.</p>
<p>Frederick Warren-Boulton, a Princeton-trained economist retained by the government, argued the merger would permit the combined companies to raise prices by anywhere from five percent to 10 percent. At the same time, he acknowledged that prices &quot;are probably declining in this (stationery) industry and will continue to decline.&quot;</p>
<p>The FTC contends the two superstore chains and the third player in the field, OfficeMax constrain each other from raising prices. The FTC says other chains that sell consumable office supplies, such as Wal-Mart, are essentially not a factor.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the office superstores presented witnesses who characterized Wal-Mart as a &quot;silent killer,&quot; positioned to put the brakes on any attempt by a combined office superstore to raise prices.</p>
<p>During his testimony, Warren-Boulton contended that statistical data showed that Wal-Mart would have essentially no effect on the prices of the office superstores.</p>
<p>By contrast, Hausman argued that competitors outside the office superstore industry -- such as Wal-Mart and others -- would force prices down.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the office superstores) face potentially the fiercest competition in the history of this country,&quot; he said, arguing it would be &quot;suicide&quot; for an office superstore to raise prices.</p>
<p>Hausman also said the combined chain would achieve new efficiencies that would permit it to cut prices and remain competitive.</p>
<p>But David Painter, an accountant for the FTC, testified that he was unable to find support for the levels of efficiency claimed by the two chains. He said that although savings from efficiency were claimed at around 5 percent, he could find substantiation for only 1.43 percent, with another 1.66 percent but possible.</p>
<p>If the judge rules for the government, the office superstore chains have said they will abandon their effort to merge.However, the government would be free to pursue the matter through the courts. If it ultimately wins, the combined chain might be required to break up later.</p>
