<p>A beer war between the Czech Republic and Slovakia loomed on Wednesday after Bratislava imposed a restrictive 532,000 hectolitre annual import quota on Czech beer.</p>
<p>The ceiling, introduced last week, was justified by Slovak officials and brewers as a &quot;normal&quot; measure to protect a domestic industry finding it difficult to cope with stiff foreign competition.</p>
<p>&quot;The quota should help our brewers fight the ever-growing penetration of Czech breweries in the Slovak market which is increasing year by year,&quot; Jozef Hudec of the Slovak Agriculture Ministry told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very common measure to protect domestic producers in many countries,&quot; added Stefan Karsay, owner of Slovakia's fourth largest brewer, Pivovar Karsay.</p>
<p>But Czech Industry Minister Karel Kuhnl called the beer quota an unfortunate measure in an interview with the Czech daily Pravo.</p>
<p>&quot;In our opinion it will have no effect on Slovak breweries as the hole in the market will simply be filled with beer imports from third countries,&quot; Kuhnl was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Czech breweries, which have been aggressively pushing exports at a time when the domestic beer industry is being hit by declining consumption and low profitability, were angered by the limit.</p>
<p>&quot;We are disappointed by this decision...as our key trademark in Slovakia, Staropramen, competes by quality and not price,&quot; said Diana Dobalova, spokeswoman for Prazske Pivovary a.s. which is 55-percent owned by Britain's Bass.</p>
<p>Another Czech brewer, Radegast a.s., which is 33 percent owned by Bass, repeated a theme voiced by several Czech breweries that they did not know how much of their exports to Slovakia would be cut.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we're not pleased by this. We were just told that every (Czech) exporter would receive its own quota for the next period but we still don't know how much it will be,&quot; said a Radegast official.</p>
<p>Radegast, the second largest Czech brewer by market share, exported 136,000 hectolitres of beer to Slovakia in 1996, out of total exports of 186,000 hectolitres.</p>
<p>The Slovak limit of 532,000 was arrived at by taking the average level of Czech beer imports over the last three years. In 1996, the Czechs exported around 643,000 hectolitres of beer to Slovakia after 484,000 in 1995 and 464,000 in 1994</p>
<p>&quot;In the first five months of this year we imported 174,000 hectolitres of Czech beer which was 17.2 percent more than in the same period of 1996,&quot; said Hudec.</p>
<p>He added that the quota for each Czech beer would be set every quarter by the Czech Industry Ministry and the Slovak Economy Ministry when regular export-licences are allocated.</p>
<p>Slovak breweries, always considered second  to Czech trade marks, are plagued by outdated production facilities and a less celebrated brewing tradition.</p>
