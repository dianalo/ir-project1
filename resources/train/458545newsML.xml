<p>IPE gas oil ended down $2.50 a tonne at the intraday low on Friday in line with weaker U.S. products, brokers said.</p>
<p>Front month April gas oil settled at $170.75, completing a steady retreat begun after the NYMEX opening. It had touched a high of $174.25 in early activity.</p>
<p>&quot;It fell in line with the rest of the board,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Futures were knocked lower an hour after the U.S. opening by an announcement of an agreement by Russia to develop seven billion to eight billion barrels of reserves in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Traders reported some nervousness at remarks by Russian Energy Minister Pyotr Rodinov in Baghdad that execution of the contract would happen regardless of U.N. Gulf War sanctions against Iraq.  </p>
<p>Traders said the nervousness faded when it became clear the contract was a long-term development contract and did not herald short-term growth in Iraqi oil production or exports.</p>
<p>May Brent was down 12 cents at $20.06. May/June Brent was looking softer at around five cents. The May Brent/NYMEX crude spread was $1.54, around four cents softer than earlier.</p>
<p>A weak performance by NYMEX gasoline also helped depress the complex. April was down 0.38 cent at 67.20 cents a gallon at 1801 GMT. &quot;It (gasoline) was looking wobbly today and the question is whether it can maintain the recent firmness which has helped the whole complex,&quot; a trader said.</p>
