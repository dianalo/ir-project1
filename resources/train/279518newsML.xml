<title>EGYPT: Holiday mood slows Cairo bourse trade, prices up.</title>
<headline>Holiday mood slows Cairo bourse trade, prices up.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1996-12-29</dateline>

<p>A holiday mood continued to slow trading at the Cairo stock exchange on Sunday but prices rose despite thin demand, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index rose 0.41 percent to 288.89. Volume was a high 92.6 million pounds, buoyed by the sale of one million shares in Amriyah Cement to big investors at prices ranging from 67.01 and 71.00 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;It was another quiet day but I think the bourse will definitely leap within the first few weeks of January when the foreign investors come back to the market,&quot; said Youssef Khalil of brokerage firm Delta/EAB.</p>
<p>Amriyah Cement, in which the state is planning to sell another 2.4 million shares, topped the day's turnover and shares fell 0.25 pounds to 68.00.</p>
<p>Medinet Nasr Housing and Development was the bourse's biggest gainer and share in the privatised firm rose 32.11 percent to 390.00 pounds.</p>
<p>The state sold its majority in Medinet Nasr eight months ago and shares were priced at 60 pounds each.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are clamouring for the shares after they heard that it would give a free share in addition to a cash dividend soon,&quot;Khalil said.</p>
<p>Cairo stock exchange officials effectively strangled trading in favourite realty firm Heliopolis Housing and Development by freezing the share price, brokers said.</p>
<p>The brokers said prices of Heliopolis heavily-traded shares will remain at 430 pounds until a CMAcommittee investigates claims that the stock is overpriced.</p>
<p>CMAofficials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee will meet within this week but its quite ridiculous. There are real reasons why this company rose and its not just speculation,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The CMAindex for openly traded firms rose to 432.44 points from 431.61 on Wednesday while the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms also rose to 203.72 from 202.62.</p>
<p>Of the 90 shares traded, losing stocks outnumbered gainers 20 to 28 while the rest ended unchanged.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.40 pounds</p>
