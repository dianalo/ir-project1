<title>MEXICO: Mexico peso ends firm but cautious on Cetes rates.</title>
<headline>Mexico peso ends firm but cautious on Cetes rates.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Mexican peso closed firmer across the board Tuesday as foreign investors bought Mexican securities ahead of an expected fall in domestic interest rates.</p>
<p>Traders noted, however, that rates had barely changed since midsession due to caution ahead of the primary auction of Cetes, or T-bills, later today.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate both closed 1.3 centavos firmer at 7.8340/7.8380 and 7.8290/7.8340, respectively, per dollar.  </p>
<p>&quot;It didn't move after midday, there was nothing to trade on. Everyone is waiting for auction results,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Foreign investors stepping into Mexico pushed local stocks up 0.79 percent to 3,519.75 points as the foreign exchange market was closing. In a similar move, overnight Cetes rates were down 50 basis points to 25.00 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said that expected falls in primary rates and forthcoming U.S. and Mexican economic data could well sap the peso's recent strength in coming sessions.  </p>
<p>&quot;The peso must begin to turn around, as the market is at resistance,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It could react strongly to the primary auction.&quot; Peso resistance is seen around 7.820.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of nine money market traders showed they expected Banco de Mexico to assign bellwether 28-day Cetes at an average rate of 24.78 percent, or 93 basis points below last week's rate.</p>
<p>Dealers said they awaited the impact of U.S. producer prices, due Thursday, on U.S. interest rates, and consequently on the peso. They similarly awaited Mexican inflation data for December, also due to be announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders said another reason the peso failed to extend midday gains against the dollar was that banks chose to exercise dollar puts previously bought from the central bank.</p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had closed earlier 1.2 centavos firmer at 7.8260/7.8310 per dollar.</p>
