<p>Russian bread-baking, once the domain of bureaucrats who controlled every kernel of wheat, is increasingly in the hands of entrepreneurs who want a slice of the action in Russia's most important food.</p>
<p>Scores of mini-bakeries have sprung up in Moscow and other cities, with everyone from nuclear physicists to plumbers cashing in on demand for a centuries-old staple that nearly every Russian eats every day.</p>
<p>The boom in private bakeries sits well with customers eager to avoid the queues at formerly state-run bakeries. But it is giving Russia's top bread official indigestion.</p>
<p>&quot;Many new businessmen don't have enough specialist education to bake bread,&quot; said Igor Chekmezov, head of the government's State Bread Inspectorate, who wants to see baking licensed.</p>
<p>&quot;We checked a host of mini-bakeries and found not specialists, but rather everybody from toilet repairmen to Academy of Sciences members trying to bake bread.&quot;</p>
<p>The inspectorate, otherwise known as Russia's bread police, is a key ingredient in Kremlin policies on grain in the new market economy, advising cabinet officials on everything from price regulation to wheat imports.</p>
<p>&quot;Bread is a special product in Russia -- it's holy,&quot; Chekmezov said in an interview. &quot;It's in our genetics to relate to it in a particularly careful way.&quot;</p>
<p>Private bakers say their recipe for success stems as much from the laws of supply and demand as from the potent symbolism of Russia's most basic food.</p>
<p>The 500 or so mini-bakeries in the capital already supply 12 percent of the city's market, the Moscow Guild of Bakers said.</p>
<p>At &quot;Our Bread&quot;, a private mini-bakery in central Moscow, 22-year-old director Alexei Nikishov said business was rising.</p>
<p>Standing on a flour-dusted floor as three women poked poppy seeds and raisins into buns, he said, &quot;I've learned all this myself, and if I had to turn out the sweet rolls or loaves without any help, I could.&quot;</p>
<p>Such free, deregulated use of grain -- a commodity Russian Revolution leader Vladimir Lenin once called &quot;the currency of currencies&quot; -- was unheard of in the Soviet era, when officials tracked the movement of every parcel.</p>
<p>Now farmers are largely free to sell most of their wheat as they wish, and imports of flour have soared.</p>
<p>That worries Chekmezov, a man who remembered how Russians went wild eating the soft centres of loaves when World War Two ended after years of starvation-level rations.</p>
<p>He said many private mini-bakeries -- unlike &quot;Our Bread&quot; -- sold their goods from dusty wooden crates in filthy surroundings outside rat-infested train stations and ramshackle kiosks.</p>
<p>Much Russian bread these days crumbles or is stale -- a sign of low gluten, the protein that distinguishes bread-making wheat from cattle feed.</p>
<p>The State Health Inspectorate estimated that more than a third of mini-bakeries in Moscow violate sanitation norms.</p>
<p>&quot;There is cause for alarm, with some elements that are banned in the West being used in baking these days,&quot; Chekmezov said, adding that some Russian bread had shown high levels of salts, heavy metals, pesticides and additives.</p>
<p>While Chekmezov said quality at some of the new bakeries was debatable, he credited the newly-open grain trade, including private mini-bakeries, with allowing some regions to avoid the notorious bread rationing-coupons familiar in recent decades.</p>
<p>Russian imports of wheat flour, mostly from Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, rose nearly 20-fold over July 1995-June 1996 to nearly one million tonnes compared with levels a year ago -- testimony to growing output by private bakeries.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the third year in a row we're going to have a bad harvest, and we're getting by thanks to the developing grain trade,&quot; Chekmezov said.</p>
<p>Past bread shortages have helped spur political unrest and, in 1917, a revolution that ushered in the communists.</p>
<p>&quot;Land, Peace and Bread&quot; was Lenin's battle-cry to rally peasants to his cause, while ironman Josef Stalin requisitioned farmers' grain and undertook a brutal collectivisation programme which spurred a collapse in agriculture that continues today.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Bread&quot; uses 600 kg (1,325 lb) of wheat flour and 300 kg (660 lb) of rye flour daily to bake one tonne of goods, including Russia's famous black bread and trendy sweet rolls.</p>
<p>Russia has privatised its formerly state-run industrial and commercial bakeries but many still do business the old way, with obsolete technologies and sulky service.</p>
<p>Those which are merely retail outlets and do not bake on the premises are hostage to inconsistent supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;At my place, the customer knows two things,&quot; Nikishov said. &quot;That he will always find bread, that it will always be hot.&quot;</p>
<p>The bread inspectorate wants each private bakery to have a certified bread specialist on the premises, as well as an agreement with a laboratory to verify flour quality.</p>
<p>But to Chekmezov, bread is more than Russia's staff of life.</p>
<p>&quot;When I'm asked, &quot;How is Russia different from the United States&quot; I say &quot;in its sacred relationship to bread,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, with our bread, you can knock back 50 grams of vodka. It's usually a meal in itself.&quot;</p>
