<p>U.S. dealers and analysts had mixed feelings about the U.S. government's announcement on Tuesday it will issue its first inflation-indexed security, a 10-year note, on January 15.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to have protection against inflation but the inflation-indexed bonds are not going to have the liquidity of a conventional Treasury bond,&quot; said Jim Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;You have a 7.0-percent bond protection from inflation right there,&quot; Glassman said of the Treasury 30-year bond.  </p>
<p>The value of the principal for the new bonds will be indexed to the CPI-U (Consumer Price Index in urban areas) and adjusted accordingly every six months.</p>
<p>Glassman pointed out the inflation-indexed bonds are not &quot;guaranteed against all risks -- just inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Beside inflation expectations, long-term rates respond to fiscal policy and changes in the global economy.</p>
<p>Glassman said the inflation-indexed bond market is likely to suffer from a lack of liquidity unless Treasury &quot;issues so many of them that they would have to cut down on what they are issuing otherwise.&quot;  </p>
<p>Investors ususally expect U.S. long-term issues to be priced at 300 basis points above the inflation rate.</p>
<p>The 30-year benchmark debt is currently attractively priced relative to actual inflation. However, the market has priced in additional inflationary expectations in the current environment of full employment.</p>
<p>&quot;Market forces are going to determine this (spread),&quot; Glassman said. &quot;If the public here wants to accept 2.50 percentage points or less, that's their prerogative.&quot;</p>
<p>Steve Strong, director of commodity research at Goldman, Sachs and Co., said the new bonds have &quot;a very mixed appeal.&quot;  </p>
<p>Strong expected the inflation-index bonds to find an audience mainly among individual investors seeking stable, virtually risk-free income, and corporations or insurance companies that have CPI-linked obligations.</p>
<p>&quot;It's for people who are in retirement or near retirement because that safeguards income flow,&quot; Strong said. &quot;For investors who have longer-term perspective, it's probably not very attractive at all.&quot;</p>
<p>He concluded: &quot;Basically, it's very well suited for small investors who are willing to accept minimal return or who need to guarantee their income in the retirement.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates, said it is difficult to predict how investors will respond to the new issues until the government makes clear what tax rules would apply.</p>
<p>&quot;The breadth of the reception is still unclear because Treasury did not release some details, in particular the tax treatment of the securities,&quot; McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Inflation-indexed bonds may be treated as zero coupons -- meaning a debt instrument that accrues interest over the years but does not pay anything until maturity.</p>
<p>Investors in zeros, however, must pay taxes on interests every year before they mature -- meaning a negative cashflow likely to discourage many small investors.</p>
<p>&quot;If they are taxed at maturity, this would make a great difference for the cashflow,&quot; McCarthy stressed.</p>
<p>Treasury officials have said they hope the new bonds would encourage Americans -- the worst savers among in the industrialized world -- to save more.</p>
