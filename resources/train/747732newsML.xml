<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates ease further on bank lending.</title>
<headline>KL interbank rates ease further on bank lending.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-07-22</dateline>

<p>Interbank rates fell further on Tuesday on lending by big banks, and dealers said there was room for more downside.</p>
<p>&quot;The rates are gradually coming off and I think there's a bit more to go,&quot; said a dealer at a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>Dealers said a few large banks, which are also agent banks of the central Bank Negara, were seen lending on the one-month.</p>
<p>One-month money was at 8.5 percent against 9.0/9.3 percent on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The three-month rate was at 8.0/8.3 percent against 8.0/9.0 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said direction of interbank rates would continue to be determined by the central bank's operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a matter of how quickly Bank Negara wants rates to fall and to what level,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Bank Negara was said to be lending overnight and one-month funds over the past week to help eased market tightness.</p>
<p>Recent heavy buying of the ringgit by the central bank to defend the ringgit from speculative attack had caused a liquidity squeeze.</p>
<p>Although the actual size of the intervention was not known, dealers have estimated that between 2.5 billion and 5.0 billion ringgit was drained from the system.</p>
<p>Acting Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last week that Malaysia did not favour a high interest rate regime.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange remained firm on the back of falling interbank rates on the cash market.</p>
<p>At 0400 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up one point to 92.44, or an implied yield of 7.56 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract was up two to 92.66, or 7.34 percent.</p>
