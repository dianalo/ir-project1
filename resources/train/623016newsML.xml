<title>UK: North Sea mixed as Brent corrects, grades hold firm.</title>
<headline>North Sea mixed as Brent corrects, grades hold firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea crudes were mixed on Thursday as benchmark Dated Brent fell sharply and other grades held up amid sustained demand for second half June barrels, traders said.</p>
<p>Dated Brent traded early at July Brent -24 cents, a fall of nearly 30 cents on the last reported deal as the aggressive buyer of recent days turned seller.</p>
<p>Traders said Brent was due for a fall and Brent CFDs barely flinched. Next week's June 2-6 dates eased just a couple of cents to talk at July Brent -32/-29 cents.</p>
<p>July Brent gained 36 cents to $19.60 a barrel by 1730 GMT.  </p>
<p>Dealers said Brent's outright gains came as early losses prompted by mildly bearish builds in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks petered out and reversed on technical strength.</p>
<p>Intermonth Brent cash spreads were little changed, June/July trading between -20 and -16 cents and July/August at -13 and -12 cents.</p>
<p>Two Brents turning wet on Thursday were clocked to BP and Morgan Stanley. A third was kept by Phibro, traders said.</p>
<p>Other spot North Sea grades held their differentials despite Brent's sharp slide, Ekofisk, Forties and Flotta all trading at broadly unchanged levels.  </p>
<p>Three third decade June cargoes of Forties traded at around Dated Brent +32/+33 cents while two Ekofisks due to load around June 16-18 fetched July Brent +18 and +20 cents.</p>
<p>But while cheaper Brent was helping refinery margins and encouraging a few buyers back into the market, it was prompting some to hold back in anticipation of softer differentials.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen some interest but since the lower Brent deal a few people have been holding back,&quot; said a North Sea producer.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean market was quiet with traders watching the impact of delays at the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk after an oil spill earlier this week.  </p>
<p>The port was operating with only two berths early on Thursday but a third, berth number six, was due to reopen at about 1800 local time.</p>
<p>West African markets were also thin with most June fob avails placed and traders waiting for the release of July loading programmes for Nigerian export streams.</p>
<p>The Indian Oil Corp (IOC) awarded two VLCCs of Nigerian crude in its July purchase tender, one of Escravos to Chevron and one of Qua Iboe to Mobil, traders said.</p>
