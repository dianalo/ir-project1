<p>The lingering logjam that has stalled construction projects important to every part of Massachusetts appears to have been broken with news that plans for a new convention center in Boston are finally advancing, State House News reported.</p>
<p>House Speaker Thomas Finneran is reportedly convinced that the latest scheme to finance a $700 million convention facility in Boston is more reasonable than those of the past, and will not sap the state budget or consume money needed for other capital projects.</p>
<p>A hearing on the Boston bill is scheduled for Monday before the State Administration Committee and Gov. William Weld is expected to testify.</p>
<p>The same committee was urged by the Weld administration on Wednesday to advance similar capital projects for other parts of the state.</p>
<p>For the past two years, it has been understood that in order to garner legislative votes for a Boston convention center, economic development projects in other regions would also have to move.</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci pushed for all of the projects.</p>
<p>Boston, San Francisco and New Orleans are the most desirable sites for major conventions, Boston is unable to handle the larger ones, Cellucci said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Boston Convention Center piece has been structured in such a way that it won't have much of impact on the bond cap,&quot; Cellucci told legislators.</p>
<p>&quot;Our plan for a Boston Convention Center won't reduce the General Fund at all - because we propose a revenue financing structure without significant use of general obligation bond proceeds,&quot; he said.  &quot;That means there will be money within the $900 million bond cap for Worcester, Springfield, Fall River and Berkshire County projects.  And that  means the entirecommonwealth will get the maximum benefit from the legislation that has been filed to get the convention center.</p>
<p>&quot;Gov. Weld and I believe that Worcester needs a convention center, Springfield needs the Basketball Hall of Fame, Berkshire County needs the National Music Center, and Fall River needs a revitalized Kerr Mill site, just as badly as the city of Boston needs its convention center,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bill heard Wednesday provides $17 million for the Worcester Convention Center expansion, already underway and scheduled for completion in September. The project is designed to attract more conventions, tourists and jobs to the city.</p>
<p>The National Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield would get a $25 million boost under terms of the bill. The existing riverfront site would be enhanced by a retail development and by construction of what Cellucci called a &quot;state-of-the-art, multimedia exhibit hall with interactive displays that will let every kid find out what it's like to play one-on-one with Michael Jordan.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill also provides $2.5 million for the National Music Center in Berkshire County.</p>
<p>Another $3.5 million would be used to develop the Kerr Mill site in downtown Fall River. &quot;Long ago, textile mills were the backbone of the Fall River economy, and now these buildings may become the backbone of that economy again,&quot; the lieutenant governor said.</p>
