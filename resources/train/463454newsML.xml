<p>The dollar moved modestly higher Monday ahead of a critical meeting by U.S. monetary policy makers Tuesday where the fate of interest rates may be decided, currency dealers said.</p>
<p>In an otherwise lackluster session, a sharp rally in the British pound lent support to the dollar, especially against the German mark as investors bought pounds and sold marks.</p>
<p>Growing prospects for a rise in U.S. short-term interest rates at Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting also aided the U.S. currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nervousness over a possible downturn in worldwide stock and bond markets Tuesday if U.S. interest rates are raised acted as a cap on dollar gains.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be important to see how the other markets react to what the Federal Reserve does or does not do,&quot; said Bob Near, a vice president at the Bank of New York.</p>
<p>&quot;The most likely reaction tomorrow is a market sell-off -- buy the rumour, sell the fact,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates typically serve as a brake on the speed of economic growth and make the domestic currency more attractive to investors.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange experts widely expect the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points Tuesday to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent, which would be the first increase by the committee in more than two years.</p>
<p>Currency dealers said they have already incorporated this expectation into the dollar's current trading level.</p>
<p>The market virtually ignored comments from German Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke, who addressed the troubling overseas ramifications of higher U.S. rates.</p>
<p>Welteke was quoted by German radio saying he hoped the United States would not raise rates for as long as possible, or German interest rates might move higher, which &quot;cannot be desirable&quot;.</p>
<p>The dollar inched higher to 1.6880 marks by Monday's close from 1.6866 marks in late trade Friday and to 122.85 yen from 122.77 yen.</p>
<p>The pound rose broadly after news of healthy fourth-quarter British economic growth and a sharp improvement in its trade balance.</p>
<p>British gross domestic product expanded by 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter, and the country posted a current account surplus of 873 million pounds ($516 million) in the same period.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw good buying of sterling. Their numbers that came out were on the strong side and that added to the rally today,&quot; said Seth Garrett, chief dealer at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>Sterling rose to a high of $1.6215 before closing at $1.6195 from $1.6052 Friday.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar crawled higher to 1.4584 Swiss francs from 1.4575 and Canadian $1.3795 from C$1.3786.</p>
