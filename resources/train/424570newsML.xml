<p>Shareholders of Koor Industries will be asked at a general meeting on March 25 to extend managing director Benjamin Gaon's contract another five years, a spokesman for the company said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the extension was timed to coincide with a five-year strategic plan that Gaon and Koor officials have nearly completed. He said the board wanted Gaon to oversee the plan's execution through the end of the year 2001.</p>
<p>The spokesman would not reveal any details of the strategic programme, which he said was due to be approved by Koor's board next month.</p>
<p>Gaon has been managing director of Koor since 1988. In the following years, he brought the holding company, Israel's largest, back from the brink of bankcruptcy.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company has focused on five core areas -- telecommunications, electronics, building products, agro-chemicals and energy distribution -- and has begun a process of forming strategic partnerships with multinationals for its operating companies.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the general terms of Gaon's contract would remain unchanged for the five-year period but added that they were subject to renegotiation on an annual basis.</p>
