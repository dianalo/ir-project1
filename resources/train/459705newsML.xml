<p>Costas Karamanlis, nephew of Greek elder statesman Constantine Karamanlis, was elected on Friday new leader of the main conservative opposition New Democracy party with the hard task to unite it.</p>
<p>Karamanlis, 40, won 2,350 votes to the 1,048 garnered by hios closest challenger, former economy minister George Souflias, at a party congress.</p>
<p>Karamanlis is a lawyer and party deputy from the northern port city of Salonika. A quiet backbencher, he has never held government office nor expressed any political ambition until earlier this year.</p>
<p>New Democracy is badly divided and disoriented following an election loss last September to the ruling PASOK socialist party of Prime Minister Costas Simitis.</p>
<p>The party was founded by Constantine Karamanlis in 1974 after the fall of a seven-year dictatorship. He won two four-year terms during which he led Greece into the European Union and then moved on to become state president.</p>
<p>&quot;The younger Karamanlis is riding on his uncle's name,&quot; said Stelios Apostolakis, a party member at the congress. &quot;But it will take more than a name to unite New Democracy and lead it to power.&quot;</p>
<p>Outgoing New Democracy president Miltiadis Evert was blamed for last year's election loss and came third in Friday's leadership vote behind Karamanlis and Souflias.</p>
