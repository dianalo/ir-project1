<p>A European single currency would make life more certain for cereals markets in countries which take part in Economic and Monetary Union, according to one British grain trader.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be trading grain, not currency,&quot; Angela Gibson, of Glencore Grain (UK) Ltd, said in a speech prepared for Agra Europe's conference on &quot;Agrimoney and EMU&quot; in London on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the UK, for the first six months of this season, it has appeared that we have been little more than currency traders,&quot; Gibson said.</p>
<p>Green rates, which the EU uses to convert amounts set as part of its farm policy from Ecu into national currencies, affect area aid payments, intervention prices, export refunds and import tariffs, Gibson said.</p>
<p>The benefit for countries in EMU is that all these payments would be in Euro, and so not liable to the uncertainties of currency markets, or the green money or agrimoney system.</p>
<p>A single currency would eliminate trade flows caused by monetary disturbance. It would eliminate the need for currency hedging by grain traders and eliminate currency conversion costs both for hedge transactions and intra-EU trade.</p>
<p>Countries outside EMU would still need an agrimoney system.</p>
<p>The system aimed to improve stability, Gibson said. But sometimes it increased distortion.</p>
<p>Within EMU distortions should decrease as the number of members increases and payments are made in Euro, although some distortion will incredibly occur between those countries within EMU and those outside.</p>
<p>Before the introduction of Europe's single market at the start of 1993, a system of border subsidies and levies, known as monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs), protected the agricultural sector from the impact of currency movements and support prices remained stable, Gibson said.</p>
<p>Since the abolition of border controls green rates have to be changed to reflect currency movements. Coupled with the reduction in support prices, this has led to an increase in volatility in the grains market, she said. --Christopher Lyddon, London newsroom +44 171 542 7928</p>
