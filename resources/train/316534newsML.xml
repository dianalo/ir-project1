<p>Swedish truck maker Scania said its share of the truck market in Western Europe rose to 15.5 percent between January and November 1996 compared to 14.5 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p>Scania said figures for the full year will be released with 1996 earnings on February 18.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market share is growing in the largest market block -- Great Britain, Germany and France -- which together account for about 60 percent of all heavy trucks registered in Europe,&quot; said Urban Erdtman, head of Scania's European sales in a statement released in Stockholm and Brussels.</p>
<p>On these markets, the first 11 months showed a two percent reduction in total registrations compared with the previous year while Scania increased its figures by just over four percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Scania secured almost 12 percent of the total market within this block. The ambition is to take additional market shares,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Erdtman said Scania was concentrating its efforts in Germany and France on consolidating its position through investments in and reorganising the dealership network.</p>
<p>The company said statistics for calendar 1996 showed Scania increased its market share in Britain to 18.6 percent from 16.6 percent while market share in Sweden rose to 48.3 percent from 43.6 percent a year ago.</p>
