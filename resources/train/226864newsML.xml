<p>Truckers were clearing their last roadblocks from French roads overnight after a crippling 12-day strike, but there were fears of new turmoil ahead as oil industry unions urged members to prepare for action.</p>
<p>Only about a dozen roadblocks still stood late on Friday night compared to 249 on Thursday.</p>
<p>But oil industry workers were to be consulted on Monday about staging their own disruptions at refineries across the country to press demands over pay, retirement age and job cuts.</p>
<p>The truckers' strike was accompanied by roadblocks around the country's main oil refineries, which led to the strangling of the economy and forced petrol rationing in half of France.</p>
<p>Up to 10,000 petrol stations -- more than half of the nation's 18,000 -- had run dry or were about to close and it will take two to three days for supplies to resume fully even without new disruption by the oil industry workers.</p>
<p>The fear of a &quot;snowball&quot; effect from the strikes has been present throughout the truckers' strike, with analysts closely watching if other workers would join in.</p>
<p>Political commentators said the strike highlighted the weakness of Prime Minister Alain Juppe's cabinet, with both workers and employers leaning on the government to sign cheques to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;The lorry drivers' strike is perceived by market participants as providing a new example of 'the French risk', associated with bursts of social anger leading the government to step back when it is involved,&quot; said Eric Chaney, senior economist at the Morgan Stanley Bank in Paris.</p>
<p>The state made most of the concessions in the lorry dispute by agreeing to cut payroll taxes on employers and help finance early retirement for truckers. It also said it will step in to resolve a dispute over working hours by decree.</p>
<p>&quot;Our feeling is that our profession has won dignity and recognition in these 12 days of struggle,&quot; said Claude Debons, spokesman for the biggest union, the Socialist-led CFDT.</p>
<p>Juppe, calling for a rapid return to normal, said: &quot;I am happy that the efforts made by all negotiating partners are now apparently crowned by success. I think a balanced solution has been found.&quot;</p>
<p>Negotiators for the truckers signed five agreements covering retirement at 55 instead of 60 for drivers with 25 years' service, sick pay, travel expenses, union rights and a ban on Sunday driving.</p>
<p>The employers doubled their offer of a special bonus payment to 3,000 francs ($600) and the government promised a decree on work time within two weeks to meet key demands for full payment for hours worked, including unloading time and compulsory rest.</p>
<p>The strike in the crucial pre-Christmas commercial period cost European food and haulage industries tens of millions of dollars a day, prompting protests from France's neighbours.</p>
