<p>Former French interior minister Charles Pasqua, ignoring an appeal for Gaullist unity from Prime Minister Alain Juppe, said on Monday too much was being sacrificed to the goals of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>Pasqua told Europe-1 radio the French felt too much was being sacrificed in the name of &quot;an obstinate pursuit of the Maastricht criteria&quot; on European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;The belief seems to be that going for the Euro and having a single currency will solve all problems,&quot; Pasqua, a former anti-Maastricht campaigner, said.</p>
<p>&quot;That reminds me of what people said during the Maastricht campaign. &quot;Europe means peace', and we got Yugoslavia. &quot;Europe means growth and full employment', and we now have 18 million jobless,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Juppe, marking the 20th anniversary of the Rally for the Republic (RPR) party, on Sunday urged critics, including Pasqua, to stop sniping and unite behind his austerity reforms to qualify France for the European single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We have differences sometimes, even major differences ... but we also feel we belong to the same family and this is stronger than differences,&quot; Juppe told a party rally.</p>
<p>In his radio interview, Pasqua said ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur, National Assembly Speaker Philippe Seguin and himself -- all RPR critics of Juppe -- &quot;believe that the maximum should be done to push for new economic growth. Government policy has not yet achieved this&quot;.</p>
<p>French interest rates had been lowered, but too gradually to relaunch investment and development, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to give the French the possibility, within the framework of a referendum demanded by the people, to decide themselves what they want to be consulted about,&quot; Pasqua added.</p>
