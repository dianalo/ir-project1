<p>U.S. safety officials said on Wednesday they would hold a public meeting this summer on the July 1996 midair explosion of TWA flight 800 even though they might not be ready to declare the cause of the crash.</p>
<p>National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee the explosion occurred in the centre fuel tank of the Boeing Co. 747, &quot;but the origin of the explosion is not yet known.&quot;</p>
<p>The board is weighing three possible causes, mechanical failure, a bomb or a missile, with some officials leaning toward mechanical failure as the likely cause.</p>
<p>Hall said the board issued recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration on Dec. 13, 1996, that it require some modifications of the 747's centre tank to reduce flammability.</p>
<p>He added, however, that &quot;to date, with over 90 percent of the airplane recovered, there is no physical evidence of a bomb or missile strike.&quot;</p>
<p>All 230 people on board the Paris-bound Trans World Airlines Inc. Boeing 747 were killed in the July 17 explosion shortly after the jet took off from New York's Kennedy airport.</p>
<p>Hall said the board planned the public meeting in late summer to gather more facts, but officials said it would not be held to analyse the findings or come to any conclusions.</p>
<p>The chairman said operations to salvage the wreckage, lying in about 120 feet (36 metres) of water off Long Island, were continuing and the wreckage was being worked into a mockup to help investigators try to get a better picture of what happened.</p>
<p>Hall also said the board will hold a final meeting this summer on the 1994 crash of a Boeing 737 near Pittsburgh, indicating it was nearing a determination of the cause of the crash that killed all 132 people on board.</p>
<p>Investigators have said there may have been a sudden, unexpected rudder movement, that caused the plane to go into an uncontrollable roll and to crash.</p>
<p>In 1991 another Boeing 737 went into a roll and crashed near Colorado Springs, Colorado, killing all 25 people on board.</p>
<p>Some rudder modifications have been ordered, even though the cause of the crashes have not been determined.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hall renewed his complaint that the causes could likely have been determined far earlier had the FAA accepted the board's recommendation to order airlines to fit jets with the latest flight data recorders.</p>
<p>Officials said that had the black boxes been upgraded to add sensors to measure additional plane movements, such as rudder action, the pre-crash actions of the 737s might have been determined and safety recommendations issued.</p>
<p>Hall also said the modern black boxes allow airlines to monitor each plane after a flight to assess its performance for safety implcations, something now regularly done by many foreign carriers.</p>
<p>The FAA ordered retrofiting of updated recorders, but at a pace too slow for the board. An FAA official told the panel the agency by law had to take into account the cost to the airlines of retrofiting, which the airlines had fought.</p>
