<p>Separatist guerrillas threw a grenade at an Indian paramilitary vehicle in the crowded central square of the Kashmiri summer capital Srinagar on Saturday, killing a passer-by, police said.</p>
<p>Seven people including two Indian paramilitary troopers were injured when the grenade went off in the city's bustling Lal Chowk square around mid-afternoon, police said.</p>
<p>No militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack, police said.</p>
<p>In other parts of the state, 12 people, among them nine separatist guerrillas, died in gunbattles with paramilitary troops.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died in northern Jammu and Kashmir state since an Islamic separatist revolt broke out in 1990, according to Indian official sources.</p>
<p>Six militants killed on Friday in a gunbattle with paramilitary troops in the thickly forested Khag area, 40 km (25 miles) southwest of Srinagar, belonged to the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen guerrilla outfit, the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The militants died in a four-hour gunbattle after Indian troops besieged their hide-out, defence spokesman Major P. Purshuttam told Reuters. One soldier was injured in the exchange, Purshuttam said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our militants inflicted heavy casualties on the Indian army,&quot; said Hizb-ul-Mujahideen in a statement that was issued to newspapers in Urdu.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have recovered six bodies from the encounter site,&quot; Purshuttam said. &quot;Most of them are suspected foreigners. The toll can go higher.&quot;</p>
<p>Hizb-ul-Mujahideen seeks Kashmir's union with neighbouring Pakistan. There are more than a dozen similar guerrilla outfits in Kashmir fighting for independence from India or merger with Pakistan, officials say.</p>
<p>Since independence in 1947, India has fought two of its three wars with neighbouring Pakistan over Kashmir. It accuses Islamabad of arming and training the separatists. Pakistan says it offers them only moral and diplomatic support.</p>
<p>Apart from the Khag incident, another six people, including three militants, died in armed encounters with paramilitary forces elsewhere in the state, the police said.</p>
