<title>NORWAY: Oslo shares creep up, DnB stays star attraction.</title>
<headline>Oslo shares creep up, DnB stays star attraction.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1997-07-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Norwegian shares on Friday shrugged off a rise in domestic short-term interest rates and retraced day-earlier losses in dull trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said the lackluster market continued to await impulses from overseas.</p>
<p>Norway's top bank Den norske Bank (DnB) continued to dominate trade, which dealers attributed to renewed speculation of a reshuffle in the Nordic financial market.</p>
<p>DnB accounted for 119 million crowns of the day's trade and gained 3.1 percent, or 0.90 crowns, to close the week at 30.20 crowns. The stock has gained two crowns since Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Tomra, a manufacturer of machines for collecting used cans and bottles for recycling, advanced four percent after presenting better-than-expected profits for the second quarter. The stock closed 6.50 crowns up at 163.50 crowns.</p>
<p>Analysts were satisfied with developments in Tomra's market segments, but underlined the importance of continued growth.</p>
<p>&quot;If we have a sudden fall in the income growth the stock will drop like a stone,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total share index closed 0.57 percent up at 1,238.79 points in turnover of almost 740 million crowns.</p>
