<p>Mexican emergency officials put the towering Popocatepetl volcano on the southeast of Mexico City on red alert on Monday and prepared to evacuate thousands of citizens who may be at risk from the eruption.</p>
<p>Clouds of swirling ash rained onto the outskirts of the capital, some 33 miles (50 km) distant. Burning rocks bounced down the volcano's sides after what officials said was the most intense seismic activity since they began monitoring years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We've warned local officials that we have emergency personnel and soldiers in position and ready for evacuation if that is what is decided,&quot; Manuel Bartlett Diaz, governor of the southeastern state of Puebla, told Televisa television.</p>
<p>The 17,890-foot (5,500 meters) Popocatepetl stands on the border of three states -- Puebla, Morelos and Mexico -- and tens of thousands of people live at the foot of its southeastern flanks, potentially in striking distance if it blows.</p>
<p>In Amecameca, which lies between the volcano and Mexico City's 18 million inhabitants, ash was so thick people were having trouble driving, Red Cross official Juan Manuel Guerrero said.</p>
<p>Radio Red said commercial aircraft were diverted from flight paths near the belching crater, and that its own helicopter was unable to approach because of the billowing ash cloud that was visible from the capital.</p>
<p>Roberto Meli, an Interior Ministry official responsible for disaster prevention, said the red alert was triggered by unusually strong seismic activity even worse than when citizens were last evacuated in December 1994.</p>
<p>That evacuation was widely resented. Locals complained that their homes were pillaged and they fell ill while forced to stay in government shelters. Officials have been reluctant to order evacuations since then.</p>
<p>Popocatepetl has spewed out ash and steam on numerous occasions this year, but officials had insisted it remained fundamentally stable. Meli noted that since the worst emission at 6:55 P.M. EDT (2255 GMT), the volcano had calmed down slightly.</p>
<p>The red alert is the highest warning signal for volcanoes in Mexico. It means the volcano is becoming unstable.</p>
