<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - Aug 11------------------</p>
<p>Copper and aluminium prices look set to test lower levels following downside chart closes on Friday, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Copper may move to test key support at $2,270 a tonne, while if aluminium breaks below $1,700 prices are likely to tumble to $1,680, they added.  </p>
<p>COPPER - Rising London Metal Exchange (LME) stocks may prompt copper to test support at $2,270 a tonne, traders and analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;With the technical indicators now resuming their fall a re-test of the recent lows around $2,270 is a possibility,&quot; LME broker Brandeis said.</p>
<p>Harry Creates of Amalgamated Metal Trading (AMT) said Friday's close suggested that a test of important support at $2,270 and possibly lower may emerge during Monday's trading.</p>
<p>Creates believed copper needed to close above $2,340 to relieve downside pressure.</p>
<p>At 0645 GMT three months LME copper was quoted at $2,301/06, versus Friday's late London close of $2,290/94.</p>
<p>ALUMINIUM - May test support towards $1,700 a tonne as the market continues to unwind its recent overbought condition.</p>
<p>Creates of AMT suggested prices may test $1,709, $1,700 and possibly $1,680 following Friday's bearish close. &quot;On the upside a close above $1,749 is needed to relieve downward pressure and target $1,73 again,&quot; Creates said.</p>
<p>Traders will be eyeing June IPAI stocks data due later on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The IPAI inventory figures are not likely to spring any big surprises as we look to the stock data to come in unchanged to slightly down,&quot; Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff said.</p>
<p>At 0645 GMT three months aluminium was quoted at $1,738/42, against $1,728/32.</p>
