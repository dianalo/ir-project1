<title>MALAYSIA: KL shares close weaker as sentiment stays fragile.</title>

<p>Shares traded mostly in the red to the end as sentiment remained fragile and buyers stayed away on Thursday, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>They said the market's southward direction was likely to continue in the immediate term as it has not found a firm bottom.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not time to buy. The market hasn't stabilised yet,&quot; said Victor Wan, senior analyst at South Johor Securities.</p>
<p>The Composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks fell 15.89 points or 1.37 percent to 1,147.96, off its intraday low of 1,143.33.  </p>
<p>The Emas Index fell 5.16 or 1.53 percent to 332.10.</p>
<p>The central bank's curbs on property and share-buying which have caused steep market falls continued to take its toll on players' confidence of the market's stability, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment is very bad. People are licking their wounds. With this kind of sentiment, the market might test support at 1,100,&quot; said a dealer at a bank-owned house.</p>
<p>A number of dealers said their foreign clients were mostly sidelined today as they expect to be able to buy stocks at lower levels. &quot;It's been very quiet here. We've had few orders,&quot; said an equity salesman at a U.S.-linked house.</p>
