<p>China plans to launch its first ocean exploration satellite in the second half of 1999, an official of the State Oceanography Bureau said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The satellite would also allow exploration and study of marine organisms, landforms under shallow water, water temperatures and ocean pollutants by distinguishing colours of the sea, the official said.</p>
<p>It might be launched with another meteorological satellite on the same rocket, but other details had not been decided, he said.</p>
<p>The satellite would cover huge areas of the sea, providing real-time data that would benefit the fishing industry and study of ocean resources, he said.</p>
<p>China plans to launch the Filipino communications satellite Mabuhay and the Apstar 2R orbiter owned by Beijing-controlled Hong Kong firm APT Satellite Holdings Ltd in August and September.</p>
<p>China is relying on the successful launch of the Mabuhay and Apstar 2R satellites to restore confidence in its space industry after a series of disasters since 1995.</p>
<p>In January 1995, a Long March 2E rocket carrying the original Apstar 2 satellite blew up shortly after blast-off, killing a family of six in a rain of fiery debris.</p>
<p>Then came the February 1996 loss of the first 3B launcher and its U.S.-built Intelsat 708 satellite payload, followed in August by the failure of a Long March 3 rocket to put its Chinasat-7 orbiter into the proper orbit.</p>
