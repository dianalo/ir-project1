<title>RUSSIA: Russian Alfa-Bank wins tender for Tyumen Oil stake.</title>
<headline>Russian Alfa-Bank wins tender for Tyumen Oil stake.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-07-18</dateline>

<p>A unit of Russia's powerful Alfa-Bank won an investment tender for 40 percent of the Tyumen Oil Company (TNK), offering $820 million, Alfa-Bank spokesman Andrei Galiyev told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we won the tender,&quot; he said. He said the group bid for the stake through its unit Novy Kholding (New Holding). &quot;We bid $820 million under the terms of the tender,&quot; he said, adding that the total covered the price of the shares and required investments over two years.  </p>
<p>Galiyev said the second-place bid came from Astra, an unknown company backed by Russian commercial bank the National Reserve Bank, which offered the equivalent of 2.9 trillion roubles ($501 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Alfa is a good, big company, and we will find the money for this longterm project,&quot; he said. &quot;We are diversifying.&quot;</p>
<p>Alfa-Bank is part of the Alfa-Group, which also includes the prominent Alfa-Eko commodity trading arm. Pyotr Aven, foreign trade minister in 1992, heads Alfa-Bank and is part of an elite group of bankers and businessmen who are said to have supported President Boris Yeltsin's 1996 re-election.</p>
<p>TNK officials had said the 40 percent stake carried a minimum price tag of around $20 million for the shares and $160 million in investment over two years. But Galiyev said officials had pegged $635 million as a more realistic minimum price.</p>
<p>The TNK tender is one of the last sell-offs of a major vertically-integrated oil company. TNK, whose major production unit is Nizhnevartovskneftegaz, accounted for around seven percent of Russia's total crude oil output last year.</p>
