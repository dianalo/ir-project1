<p>Boris Yeltsin's doctors have swallowed their professional pride and said they will seek Western advice about his planned heart bypass operation.</p>
<p>Sergei Mironov, head of the presidential medical centre, said the team of doctors planning the operation knew the stakes were high in treating the 65-year-old Kremlin leader and that patriotism was not an issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We can do a lot but, in this situation, a concrete resolution of this problem demands that we invite, at least for consultation, leading foreign specialists,&quot; he told NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>Yeltsin broke months of silence on his health, and Kremlin taboos, last week to announce he would have heart surgery. But he said Russian doctors were capable of carrying it out.</p>
<p>Doctors said Yeltsin, who had two mild heart attacks last year, needed a bypass to increase blood flow to the heart.</p>
<p>NTV said doctors would meet to decide the date of the operation between September 27 and 29 and that the president himself would help decide who carried it out.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's operation has raised speculation about struggles for power within the Russian leadership and about control over Moscow's massive nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>Presidential press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin was considering handing over the &quot;red button&quot; nuclear trigger to a deputy during the operation but did not say who would be chosen.</p>
<p>&quot;The president of the country is considering various models for one of the high officials of state to temporarily carry out the duties of president of the Russian Federation, and whether this is necessary at all,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>He did not name Prime Minister Viktor Chernmomyrdin who, under the constitution, would become interim head of state if Yeltsin had to step down.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, 58, was given some responsibility this week for key ministries, including defence and interior, which normally report directly to Yeltsin.</p>
<p>But Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin remained commander in chief and still controlled the nuclear arsenal. If the &quot;red button&quot; were handed over, it would be only for a &quot;a short time around the operation&quot; and the world would be informed.</p>
<p>NTV said pioneering U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey would join the team on the president's case.</p>
<p>But DeBakey, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said he had not been approached either to be a consultant or to operate.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to be in Moscow the week of September 22 for a symposium where I am giving a lecture but I have not been officially invited to consult or to participate in an operation on Mr Yeltsin,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>DeBakey, 88, performed the world's first successful bypass oepration in 1964. His patients have included the Shah of Iran, the Duke of Windsor and Turkish president Turgut Ozal.</p>
<p>In 1972 and 1973 he travelled to Moscow to operate on the head of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh.</p>
<p>Asked if he would see Yeltsin if approached, DeBakey said, &quot;Of course, if I'm asked, I'd be glad to help in any way I can.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin said last week he agreed to have an operation after doctors gave him the choice of surgery or a passive way of life.</p>
