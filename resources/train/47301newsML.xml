<p>Sweden's indecision about taking part in European monetary union and its perceived ante-chamber, the exchange rate mechanism, is expected to sideline the Swedish crown at a time when convergence trades may be back in vogue.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fuel behind strong bond market flows which supported the crown's spectacular 25.6 percent rally between May 1995 and June 1996 looks to be drying up.</p>
<p>Most analysts believe the Riksbank's steep monetary easing since 1997 is close to an end and they said the effect is at best ambiguous for the crown now that the inflation rate is set to tick higher again from 37-year lows.</p>
<p>The crown has notably lagged the lira's latest resurgence, for example, as the Italian unit and the Italian bond market conversely eye a well of pent-up monetary easing and the prospect of the lira's post-budget ERM re-entry.</p>
<p>&quot;The crown is more vulnerable now to less favourable domestic trends because it doesn't have the EMU/ERM safety net that currencies like the lira have,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do see a return to convergence trades in the weeks ahead, the crown will not necessarily benefit in line with the rest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A report this month from Enskilda Research in Stockholm argues that Sweden will not seek ERM membership this year. The Swedish government has adopted a wait-and-see policy toward EMU and that removes the obligation to be in the ERM for two years prior to taking part in a single currency, the report said.</p>
<p>Enskilda analysts said they do not expect Sweden to be part of the first wave of countries to move to EMU in 1999. Domestic party-political splits, public indifference on the issue and more pressing domestic policy goals are reasons for pro-EMU premier Goran Persson's reticence, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall reserve the right to have a thorough debate (on EMU) before we take a decision,&quot; Persson said late last month.</p>
<p>Meggyesi at Deutsche said it is interesting to note that Swedish 10-year yields, now at 7.99 percent, have converged on UK yields, now at 7.87 percent, and the crown may well be viewed as an EMU &quot;opt-out&quot; alternative to sterling.</p>
<p>Analysts agree that greater EMU enthusiasm in Finland will more than likely land the markka in the ERM before the crown and this event may force the Swedes to clarify their stance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the perceived life-blood of falling inflation and interest rate cuts looks to have run its course.</p>
<p>&quot;We're approaching the end of the easing cycle in Sweden at 5 percent and this looks like a very mixed blessing for the crown,&quot; said Ian Amstad, economist at Bankers Trust in London.</p>
<p>Amstad said economic growth is picking up again in Sweden and the annual inflation rate, 0.6 percent in July, is expected to push higher again over the coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;Against this background, further easing beyond 5.0 is not really justified,&quot; said Amstad, who noted that the crown has eased back as the Riksbank has slowed the pace of easing from a more regular 20-to-25 basis points earlier this year.</p>
