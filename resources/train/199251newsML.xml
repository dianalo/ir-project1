<p>IPE December gas oil ended the day $3 a tonne higher as the first flurries of snow in Europe coupled with a strong performance by New York heating oil gave the London market support, brokers said.</p>
<p>IPE gas oil closed at $221.50 a tonne and brokers expected further gains on expecations of cold weather in the U.S. northeast and the Midwest.</p>
<p>&quot;Cold weather and the sight of snow in certain parts of Europe gave us some recovery but spreads weakened slightly and didn't allow it to run,&quot; a futures broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;IPE gas oil was supported by heating oil and if the API numbers show a small draw in PADD 1 (east coast), then we will have a roofer,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>American Petroleum Institute data are due out later on Tuesday and the market is expecting to see a draw in distillates stocks, which include heating oil, because of last week's below normal temperature.</p>
<p>January Brent took heart from stronger gas oil and also firmed, trading 41 cents higher at 1834 GMT.</p>
