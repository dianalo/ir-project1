<headline>INTERVIEW - Norinchukin bank may enter repo mkt.</headline>

<p>Norinchukin Bank, a major player in the Japanese government bond market, may enter the bond repo market by around summer of this year, a bank official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to organise a structure (for bond repos) by around summertime,&quot; Mitsuru Kobayashi, manager at Norinchukin Bank's treasury &amp; securities division, told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Kobayashi said the bank is considering entering the repo market so that it will be ready if the Bank of Japan begins using the repo market in its money market operations.</p>
<p>&quot;If the BOJ begins conducting operations through the repo market, we will need to have the capability (to do repos) so we would like to prepare for that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Norinchukin Bank is also interested in bond repos as a vehicle for making efficient use of their large bond holdings, Kobayashi said.</p>
<p>The bank holds an estimated six trillion yen worth of Japanese government bonds.</p>
<p>Kobayashi said the bank would wait to see how political initiatives for the abolishment of the securities transaction tax evolve before finalising the specifics of their bond repo strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;If the securities transaction tax is abolished, the importance of bond transactions with repurchase agreements (gensaki) may grow relative to bond repo transactions,&quot; Kobayashi said.</p>
<p>More than 90 percent of gensaki trades involve government short-term instruments such as Treasury Bills and Financing Bills. The gensaki market no longer functions as a place where bond dealers lend and borrow bonds for dealing purposes.</p>
<p>Gensaki trades are subject to the securities transaction tax, while bond repos are exempt from the tax.</p>
<p>Bond repos, which are more cumbersome than the traditional gensaki deals, were started in April 1996 as a way to lend and borrow bonds without being subject to the securities transaction tax.</p>
<p>Japan levies a 0.01 yen securities transaction tax on every 100 yen worth of yen bond sales by brokers and 0.03 yen on sales by non-brokers.</p>
<p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party announced on March 14 that it would conduct a review of possible changes in the securities transaction taxes for implemention in fiscal 1998/99 as part of a wide-ranging review of the financial and land-tax systems.</p>
