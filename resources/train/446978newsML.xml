<p>The Hong Kong government said on Monday there would be no amnesty for illegal immigrants, who mainly come from China, after July 1 when Beijing resumes sovereignty over the British colony.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no change to the illegal immigration policy, all illegal immigrants found in Hong Kong would be repatriated immediately,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement, issued in response to media enquiries about what the administration's policy would be on the matter after the handover, said existing controls on the land border between China and Hong Kong would not be eased after Beijing takes over.</p>
<p>It said the government would take stern action against people involved in smuggling illegal immigrants into Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to take stern action against those caught in smuggling illegal immigrants. We will also continue our close liaison with the Chinese with a view to stopping the problem at the source,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Many mainland Chinese enter the thriving territory illegally in search of work.</p>
<p>Beijing has promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover.</p>
