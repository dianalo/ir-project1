<p>Jordan condemned a Wednesday bomb attack in a west Jerusalem street market which killed at least 13 people, blaming extremists who seek to wreck efforts to push the Middle East peace process forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Extremists attack any glimmer of hope in pushing the peace process forward whenever the circumstances are created to resume talks or a breakthrough appears on the horizon...,&quot; a overnment spokesman told the state news agency Petra.</p>
<p>Amman expressed optimism on Tuesday about prospects of relaunching Israeli-Palestinian peace talks after Israel halted plans for a new Jewish settler enclave in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The Jordanian government condemns this terrorist attack which targets innocents regardless of its motives or the party that has executed it,&quot; the spokesman was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the bombing was ...&quot;aimed in the first place to put more obstacles and hurdles to aspirations of the peoples of the region for security, stability and prosperity under comprehensive peace.&quot;</p>
<p>But Jordan urged Israel not to give extremists what they wanted by being pushed by the attack to halt the peace process with the Palestinians, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Such terrorist attacks should only be a motive to resume negotiations and revitalise the stalled peace talks, not obstruct it,&quot; the official spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is important to prevent the enemies of peace from attaining their aim,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Jordan has repeatedly warned of a renewed cycle of violence amid growing frustrations over the slow pace of the peace process.</p>
