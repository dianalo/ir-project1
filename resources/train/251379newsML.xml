<p>An increasing number of corporate debt issuers are getting set to unload a boatload of supply on the primary market as the calendar year ticks away, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The tone in the market is better today,&quot; said one syndicate source. &quot;This will prompt issuers to come out of the woodwork now and get their financing done before year-end.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading the pack is Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co's $1.2 billion multi-tranche debt offering expected to price on Thursday via lead manager Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to consist of the following tranches, dealers said.  </p>
<p>-$300 million in 30-year bonds with price talk seen in the 85 basis points over Treasuries area.</p>
<p>-$150 million in 100-year bonds with price talk seen in the 95 basis points over Treasuries area.</p>
<p>Crown Cork &amp; Seal (UK unit):</p>
<p>-$200 million in seven-year Yankee debt, price talk is seen at 60 basis points and $300 million in 10-year debt with price talk seen at 67 to 70 basis points over Treasuries</p>
<p>Crown Cork &amp; Seal (France unit):</p>
<p>-$200 million in seven-year Yankee debt with price talk in the 60 basis points area.  </p>
<p>MidAmerican Energy is also getting set to issue $100 million in A3/A rated senior unsecured five-year notes via PaineWebber, sources said. Price talk on the issue is in the 41 to 43 basis points arena.</p>
<p>Rite Aid Corp, American Re Insurance and Israel Electric are on the menu for next week's investment grade offerings, dealers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, issuers are getting set to unleash a bulk of new high-yield supply as investors stand ready to scoop it up, dealers added.  </p>
<p>Among the upcoming high-yield debt offerings are:</p>
<p>AK Steel Corp's $550 million in 10-year 144A notes via CS First Boston.</p>
<p>AES China Generating's $180 million 10-year debt offering via lead underwriter Morgan Stanley. Price talk on the issue is seen in the 400 basis points area, sources said.</p>
<p>Also, Jacor Communications' $125 million in 10-year senior subordinated notes via Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Price talk on the issue is 9.625 to 9.875 percent, sources said.  </p>
<p>Phonetel Technologies' $110 million in 10-year senior notes via JP Morgan Securities has price talk in area of 11.75 to 12.0 percent.</p>
