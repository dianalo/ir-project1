<headline>Deere posts record profit for quarter.</headline>
<dateline>MOLINE, Ill.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Deere &amp; Co., the world's largest farm equipment maker, Tuesday reported record earnings for the latest quarter, thanks to a 3 percent gain in revenues.</p>
<p>The Moline, Ill.-based company said it earned $176.8 million, or 69 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, which ended Jan. 31. That compared with year earlier earnings of $166.2 million, or 63 cents a share. Sales rose to $2.39 billion from $2.31 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The higher profits resulted from strong worldwide retail demand for the company's products, especially new tractors and combines,&quot; said Chairman Hans W. Becherer.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's first quarter sales and revenues were in line with our expectations and provide a solid base for strong full-year sales activity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The remainder of 1997 should benefit from a moderately growing domestic economy, healthy agricultural markets and generally high levels of farmer confidence,&quot; Becherer said.</p>
<p>Deere said its worldwide sales of agricultural, industrial, and commercial and consumer equipment totalled $2.003 billion for the quarter compared with $1.937 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Export sales from the United States increased to $392 million during the quarter from $308 million a year earlier due to stronger sales to the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The results at Deere's financial services unit dropped to $43.3 million from $48.7 million.</p>
<p>Deere's stock was up 62.5 cents at $42.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
