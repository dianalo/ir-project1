<p>Indian shares drifted lower on Tuesday in sluggish, slow trade as disappointed investors stayed on the sidelines after the government stuck to a controversial tax proposal, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index fell 33.46 points, or 0.96 percent, to 3,434.83.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange (NSE) index dropped 13 points, or 1.28 percent, to 1,001.</p>
<p>Parliament adjourned on Tuesday before Finance Minister P. Chidambaram made a statement on tax proposals and will reconvene on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Chidambaram stuck to a 12.9 percent minimum alternate tax proposal on Monday, squashing market expectations he would bow to pressure and dilute the tax.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know why the corporate sector should cry hoarse over this taxation,&quot; Chidambaram told parliament.</p>
<p>Analysts say the tax will squeeze profits and slow down high-growth companies which ploughed their profits back into expansion and diversification to claim hefty tax breaks.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very dull,&quot; said broker Sunil Kothari. &quot;Prices were drifting aimlessly. The big funds kept away.&quot;  </p>
<p>Volume was very light on the BSE with turnover at 2.83 billion rupees in 22.6 million shares. The net traded value on the NSE was 7.42 billion rupees in 42.82 million shares.</p>
<p>TISCO fell 3.50 rupees to 187.25, SBI 2.0 to 276.50, ITC 1.25 to 295.75 and Reliance 1.50 to 207.</p>
<p>ACC dropped 72.25 rupees to 2,046.50, Bajaj Auto 22.75 to 1,015, Gujarat Ambuja Cement 11.25 to 300, Hind Lever 5.75 to 816.50, TELCO 9.25 to 475.75 and Nestle 4.75 to 257.</p>
<p>The Madras share index shed 13.33 points to 3,491.66 and the Calcutta index lost 2.76 to 442.90.</p>
