<headline>Base metals gearing up for rally - broker Wolff.</headline>

<p>Base metals prices seem to be gathering steam for another rally like the one seen from 1993 to 1995, when prices gained 102 percent on average, broker Rudolf Wolff said.</p>
<p>&quot;The same scenario now looks set to unfold again,&quot; analyst William Adams said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;With base metal stocks for most of the metals approaching critically low levels, or in the case of lead and copper below critical levels, a combination of supply deficits and stronger demand should underpin firmer metal prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>World economic growth is expected to grow at 4.00 percent next year, which would be the highest since 1988, with low inflation and interest rates providing a strong incentive for economies to expand, Adams said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the metals are facing a supply/demand deficit in 1997 and 1998, and considering the trade have been destocking in 1996, an improvement in the order flow of semi-fabricated products should be quickly reflected in higher demand for metal,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>In addition, if fund managers believe the upside potential in stocks and bonds is limited, they may reallocate resources into commodities, Adams added.</p>
<p>But some metals will do better than others.</p>
<p>Copper prices will lag, just as zinc did in 1993-1995, since the relatively high copper price over the past several years stimulated investment in new projects, keeping the market well supplied.</p>
<p>&quot;That said, there is some uncertainty over Chinese requirements and copper could still remain a bull market if China restocks heavily,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Copper stocks are expected to rise above critical levels in 1997, but not by a large margin.</p>
<p>Tin, lead and zinc stocks are expected to fall below important levels in 1997, while aluminium's and nickel's stocks are forecast to drop, but not below key levels.</p>
