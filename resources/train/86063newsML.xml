<p>Sales of new homes hit the strongest pace in more than a decade during August, the Commerce Department said Monday, powered by a surge in sales in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Sales increased 4.7 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 832,000 -- the highest since 857,000 more than 10 years ago, in April 1986. The acceleration in sales was sharply contrary to Wall Street economists' forecasts of a falloff in August business to a rate of 744,000.</p>
<p>Both July and June sales rates were revised upward, further adding to signs that the housing industry remains vigorous as job opportunities and incomes keep expanding.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said June sales had fallen 1.8 percent to 726,000 a year and that July sales were up 7.9 percent to 783,000. But it revised the June sales rate up to 734,000 and pushed July's rate up to 795,000, an 8.3 percent increase in sales over June.</p>
<p>The August jump in national sales was fuelled by a 28.9 percent increase in business in the Midwest as houses sold there at a rate of 196,000 a year -- the fastest pace in more than 2-1/2 years, since December 1993, when sales were at a 206,000-unit rate.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the only region where August sales increased was in the South, where they gained a modest 2.6 percent to 355,000 a year. That was the strongest rate since 381,000 in July 1995.</p>
<p>Sales in the Northeast fell sharply in August by 13.9 percent to an annual rate of 62,000 and in the West they declined 2.7 percent to 219,000 a year.</p>
<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year mortgage loan averaged 8 percent in August, down from 8.25 percent in July and 8.32 percent in June. But that was well above the average 7.03 percent rate available last January.</p>
<p>Analysts said before the August sales report was issued that the availability of credit, especially low introductory rate adjustable mortgages, together with rising employment and incomes were sustaining the housing market.</p>
<p>Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or used, homes eased down 0.5 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.13 million -- a third straight monthly drop but still a relatively strong sales performance.</p>
<p>The sales rate for new homes in August was 17.7 percent higher than in August 1995, when they were selling at 707,000 a year.</p>
<p>The average home sales price in August fell to $157,800 from $167,200 in July, the lowest since price since January when it was $155,300.</p>
