<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday he was prepared to meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton for a Camp David-style summit on the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as the violence against us stops we can clear up all outstanding questions in six months,&quot; Netanyahu told Germany's ARD television in an interview, according to a German translation of his remarks in English.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't manage that within that time then Arafat, President Clinton and I can try to settle the Israeli-Palestinian dispute in a sort of Camp David summit. I think that is more constructive than telling us: you should not build in your capital.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu on Thursday signalled &quot;no deal&quot; to any halt to Jewish settlement on occupied land, the issue that has sparked a recent wave of tension and clashes in the region.</p>
<p>He has also accused Arafat of failing to do enough to prevent a resumption of suicide bomb attacks by Moslem militants. Three Israeli women were killed in a bombing in Tel Aviv on March 21 and two Palestinians died in botched bombings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect 100 percent results from Arafat, but we expect 100 percent effort,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;But there was no such effort, there was a 'green light' for the bombs.&quot;</p>
<p>He is due to meet Clinton on Monday for talks aimed at rescuing Middle East peace. Israel has demanded the Palestinian Authority crack down on &quot;terrorism&quot; as a condition for negotiating again.</p>
<p>Palestinians insist peace talks can only restart when Israel stops work on a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, where Israel broke the ground for 6,500 homes for Jews two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Palestinians have not ruled out such a Camp David-style summit but insist existing interim agreements calling for three Israeli pullbacks in the West Bank must be carried out by the middle of next year in any event.</p>
<p>Israel and Egypt made peace in 1979 at Camp David, Maryland.</p>
