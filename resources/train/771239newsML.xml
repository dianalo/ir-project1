<p>China on Thursday urged the United States not to allow Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to do anything in the United States that would damage Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>A China Foreign Ministry spokesman stopped short of demanding Washington not issue Lee a visa but said: &quot;We hope that the U.S. side will... not allow the eminent politicians of Taiwan to engage in the activities aimed at splitting the motherland... so as not to bring damage to Sino-U.S. relations.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The issue of Taiwan is always the most important and sensitive issue in the Sino-U.S. relations, and the proper handling of this issue is crucial to the development of a sound and stable Sino-U.S. relationship,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department said it expected to issue a visa to allow Lee to transit through Honolulu on September 4-5 and September 17-18 on his way to and from a conference in Panama.</p>
<p>Beijing and Taipei have been rivals since the communists won the Chinese civil war and drove the defeated Nationalists into exile in Taiwan in 1949. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and seeks to isolate the island's leaders from the international arena.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. ties plunged after Lee visited the United States in June 1995. Beijing froze semi-official talks with Taipei and launched months of menacing war games near the island.</p>
