<text>
<p>A new black South African publishing house has been formed following Indyebo consortium's purchase of Enterprise magazine and trade titles from African Life Assurance Company Ltd for two million rand.</p>
<p>Indyebo, a grouping of black business interests, will hold a 61 percent stake in the new company, Mafube Publishing which will publish titles including Enterprise 200, SA Directory of Black Managers, and Hair and Beauty Creations.</p>
<p>Aflife will hold a 15 percent stake in Mafube and Sweden's business newspaper group Dagens Industri AB a 24 percent stake.</p>
<p>The titles were sold with effect from October 1.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been an open secret in the industry that Enterprise will change owners. It was last week that we signed on the dotted line,&quot; Thami Mazwai publisher and editor-in-chief of Enterprise told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Outgoing managing director of Times Media Ltd (TML) Roy Paulson has been appointed non-executive chairman of Mafube. He retires from TML at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Mafube was seen posting turnover of 7.5 to eight million rand in its first year of operation. In the six months to September, Enterprise made a profit of 600,000 rand. Management said they would be pleased with 15 percent bottom-line returns for Mafube.</p>
<p>Mazwai said Mafube would first consolidate its publications before looking at expansion in Africa in the next five to 10 years. Indyebo has raised four million rand and two million rand was used to buy the titles.</p>
