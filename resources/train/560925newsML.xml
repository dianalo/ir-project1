<p>A 15-year-old Austrian shot dead a woman teacher and seriously injured another at a secondary school in the province of Lower Austria on Monday, local police said.</p>
<p>The boy, who has not been named, entered the school in Zoebern, 120 km (70 miles) south of Vienna, shortly before 3 p.m. armed with his father's Magnum 357 revolver, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>He opened fire on the two women as they worked in the girls' craft room, then fled on his bicycle.</p>
<p>A 48-year-old woman, identified by police as Annemarie K, died at the scene from a shot to the head. Gertrude W, 39, was taken to hospital to receive treatment for a leg wound.</p>
<p>Police arrested the boy within minutes of the incident. Austrian television said he was frustrated by his failure to find a painting apprenticeship.</p>
<p>Police said they believed the boy had attended Zoebern secondary school as a pupil.</p>
