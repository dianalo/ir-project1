<p>A new model of international security is gradually taking shape but still needs to move from the the drawing board to reality, a Swedish think-tank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Presenting its annual report, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said the process initiated seven years ago with the end of the Cold War was increasingly taking on an institutional form.</p>
<p>&quot;But it would be naive to expect that the agreements that have been reached would solve the problems...the new world order will depend on the small print,&quot; SIPRI director Adam Rotfeld told a news conference at the release of SIPRI'S 1997 Yearbook.</p>
<p>Rotfeld said changes over the past seven years had probably moved more smoothly and effectively than anyone predicted.</p>
<p>The past two months alone have seen great change, with Russia and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) leaders signing the Founding Act for a new security partnership in Europe in May.</p>
<p>This was followed by the completion of the European Union's inter-governmental conference (IGC) at its Amsterdam summit and the G7 summit in Denver that welcomed Russia's presence.</p>
<p>A NATO summit in July will invite some former communist countries to join.</p>
<p>&quot;But the question will be to what extent all these documents will really influence reality,&quot; Rotfeld said.</p>
<p>He said despite seemingly fast progress, dangers remained.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither the dangers of war nor the use of weapons...has disappeared fully forever,&quot; Rotfeld said.</p>
<p>He said despite alliances in the new cooperative system of security, at the end of the day it still came down to each country to protect itself. This was where the increasing erosion of state power was worrying.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments in many countries are being forced to share power with non-state actors,&quot; Rotfield said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is currently no cohesive structure to manage these threats. Developments in Albania and North Korea demonstrate how regional security can be affected when human security is undermined on a massive scale.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was bound to take time to merge a world divided and organised in military blocs into one space.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the creation of an organised world from chaos,&quot; he said. &quot;The emerging world...is promising, however a lot of problems will be with us for years to come.&quot;</p>
<p>SIPRI figures showed the number of armed conflicts around the world in 1996 fell to 27 from 30 in 1995 of which all but one were domestic in nature. The exception was the renewed conflict between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.</p>
<p>But SIPRI said the decline in the number of conflicts was seen as due to inactivity rather than successful peace deals. Many of the conflicts have been going on for 20-30 years.</p>
<p>Researcher Trevor Findlay said the world's failure to deal with violent crises in Africa's Great Lakes Region was one of the greatest errors in conflict management in 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;The world did not respond in the correct way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said international groups shirked responsibility and defined their responses by what they were willing to contribute rather than what was needed.</p>
<p>&quot;In the most difficult cases it requires major commitments of political and diplomatic attention, military power or its threatened used, human and material resources and finance,&quot; Findlay said.</p>
