<p>The Czech cabinet will debate raising value added tax (VAT) on energy plus changes in personal and corporate income tax in its regular weekly meeting on Wednesday, a spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Ivo Strejcek said items on the agenda include amendments of laws on the value added tax (VAT) -- currently at 22 percent -- consumption taxes applying to petrol, alcohol and tobacco, and both corporate and personal income taxes.</p>
<p>The ruling centre-right three party coalition has reached a preliminary agreement on hiking the VAT on electricity and gas to 22 percent from five percent, effective July 1. The measure still requires final cabinet approval.</p>
<p>But Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy has been quoted in local media as saying that he would demand an across the board decrease in the top VAT rate next year in return for his support for the energy VAT increase this year.</p>
<p>The plan to hike VAT on energy is a part of a price deregulation plan aimed at bringing household prices in line with prices for industry, which are currently notably higher.</p>
<p>Private TV Nova reported on Tuesday night that the Finance Ministry would propose to cut corporate tax next year to 35 percent from 39 percent and to widen income brackets for personal income tax.</p>
<p>Consumption taxes should rise.</p>
<p>The ministry declined to comment on Tuesday on tax proposals before they are discussed by the cabinet. All changes in the tax code must be approved by the parliament.</p>
<p>Strejcek said a news conference after the government meeting was planned for 3 p.m. (1400 GMT).</p>
