<p>Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said on Tuesday he was hopeful of signing a friendship treaty with Russia this week to end the quarrels that have divided the two biggest Slavic states since the end of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The chances of Russian President Boris Yeltsin clinching such a deal during a much-postponed visit to Ukraine on Friday appeared to be stronger after officials in Moscow and Kiev said agreements on key issues had been prepared for signing.</p>
<p>Documents on the bitterest dispute, over the Crimean city of Sevastopol, home to the Soviet Black Sea fleet, were also in the works, suggesting more substantive progress than some expected.</p>
<p>&quot;We must solve all existing problems on this visit,&quot; Kuchma told reporters during a summit in the Estonian capital Tallinn with leaders from the former Soviet Baltic states and Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;If Yeltsin doesn't sign the treaty, no one will,&quot; Kuchma said. &quot;The issues are highly complex and talks very difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;I have high hopes for the signing of a wide-ranging political treaty...Today I like Yeltsin more. He is less influenced by political factions now.&quot;</p>
<p>Six postponements in a couple of years of Yeltsin's visit, now set for Friday and Saturday, are a measure of the mistrust that has dogged Moscow's relations with Kiev.</p>
<p>Ukraine's 50 million population and proximity to central Europe have given it more freedom than other ex-Soviet states from continued influence from Moscow. Kuchma has said Yeltsin is eager for a treaty but has been held back by Kremlin intrigues.</p>
<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is now due in Kiev on Wednesday to finalise details of a political treaty and could sign a deal on dividing the fleet and giving the Russian navy rights to use Sevastopol, on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.</p>
<p>Russian government spokesman Igor Shabdurasilov told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday he had heard, unofficially, that a solution to the problem of Sevastopol had been found and would be part of the documents to be signed.</p>
<p>In Kiev, foreign ministry official Stanislav Lazebnyk also said agreements were being readied on the Black Sea fleet issue.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin and Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko would sign three documents, Lazebnyk said. One would set terms for basing Russian ships in Ukraine, the second would divide the fleet and the third spell out what Moscow would pay Kiev.</p>
<p>The two premiers would also sign economic cooperation deals. The presidents would then sign the overall friendship treaty and a statement on Sevastopol as well as other documents, he said.</p>
<p>Moscow and Kiev have announced more than once that a deal on the fleet was ready, but each time differences resurfaced. The division of the rusting ships is fairly clear, but the main stumbling block has been where the Russian navy would be based.</p>
<p>Kuchma said &quot;many differences remain&quot; over Kiev's offer to lease Moscow the mainly Russian-speaking port of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>There has been argument over the term, the price and the form of payment on a lease. Ukrainian diplomats said Kiev wants to limit the lease to 20 years at $2 to $2.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>The issue is a burning one in both countries. Many Russians refuse to accept that Crimea, and especially Sevastopol, is Ukrainian at all. The peninsula was only transferred from Russia in 1954 by Ukrainian-raised Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.</p>
<p>Kiev also wants some $500 to 550 million from Moscow as compensation for Ukraine's transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia five years ago. The sum could be offset against bills for Russian oil and gas, Ukraine says.</p>
<p>Kuchma warned, however, that disagreements must be overcome soon to prevent opposition groups in both countries taking advantage of continuing friction.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that we are in favour of mutual cooperation and are interested in each other,&quot; he said.</p>
