<title>SWITZERLAND: SWISS BOND MARKET CLOSING REPORT.</title>
<headline>SWISS BOND MARKET CLOSING REPORT.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-08-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bonds ended a nervous day lower, after being pushed first higher, only to edge lower towards the close.</p>
<p>One Swiss-based trader said there was early nervousness in the market before release of U.S. retail sales. The sales data, released at the same time as U.S. producer prices, showed a rise of 0.6 percent in July, roughly as expectated.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury market staged a &quot;relief rally&quot; after the U.S. data but prices later fell from Wednesday's highs as the U.S. dollar declined, taking Swiss prices lower as well, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The whole market is highly nervous,&quot; the trader said. But he said that Swiss Confederate bond futures were near support at current levels and the short end of the market, although weaker as well, also appeared to be steadying.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said that customer order flow was light. &quot;There was wild back-and-forth trade between market makers,&quot; he said of Wednesday's business.</p>
<p>** Wednesday's closing prices --</p>
<p>Conf futures down 37 at 119.85.</p>
<p>Comi medium-term bond down 15 at 113.00</p>
<p>Euro Swiss francs down four at 98.41.  </p>
<p>4-1/2 Jun 2007 bond 108.20/30 yield 3.485 pct</p>
