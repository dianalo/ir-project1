<p>Soft oils finished off their lows of the day on Thursday on the European vegetable oil market following a spell of shipper buying.</p>
<p>Soy oil closed 0.50 guilders down to 0.50 guilders up while rapeoil was unchanged, against 0.25 to 0.50 guilders lower at midday.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the shippers was very active during the afternoon, we don't know why. They could be covering contacts but on the other hand they could be back as sellers tomorrow,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Soy oil attracted most of the business with May trading from 101.75 up to 102.25, Jun/Jul at 104.50, Jul at 104.75 and Aug/Oct at 106 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Rape oil traded at 104 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Palm oil closed higher despite bearish fundamentals, but traders said the increase was due mainly to covering in the Far East ahead of the long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Malaysian market will be closed on Friday for the Moslem Eid al-Adha holiday.</p>
<p>At the close crude palm oil cif Europe was unchanged to $5 up after Apr traded at $557.50, May at $560 and Oct/Dec at $550 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>No further business was reported in products and RBD oil closed $2.50 to $7.50 up while olein was $5 higher.</p>
<p>Lauric oils were quiet and closed with coconut oil $2.50 to $10 up while palmkernel oil was $10 higher. --Jim Ballantyne, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 8062</p>
