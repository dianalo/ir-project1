<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pressed her Chinese counterpart on Monday to release prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng ahead of a Sino- American summit that is being discussed for October.</p>
<p>But during a one-hour meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen continued to stonewall Washington on the human rights issue, which U.S. officials say is central to an otherwise improving bilateral relationship.</p>
<p>&quot;She made the point, he took them on board but I can't say that he gave any commitment,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said of the Albright-Qian conversation on Wei.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Albright reaffirmed the U.S. intention to hold a summit between President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Washington later this year, Burns said.</p>
<p>Later, in an interview with CNN, Albright said that while a specific date had not been set, the summit is being discussed for October.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have reported that the 47-year-old dissident, serving a 14-year sentence for advocating reforms, was severely injured by other prisoners hoping to get reduced sentences for attacking him.</p>
<p>(Corrects to remove reference to Wei's family reporting his injury, and corrects his age).</p>
<p>Albright, meeting Qian on the fringes of the Hong Kong takeover ceremony, said the United States continued to have concerns about Wei despite an earlier explanation from Beijing, Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>She &quot;specifically raised the issue of Wei and said our concerns about his condition remain despite the explanation from China,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like him to be well treated, in fact we would like you to release him,&quot; he quoted Albright as saying.</p>
<p>The secretary of state also made the case for China to release its other political prisoners and to sign the U.N. covenant on political and civil rights, Burns said.</p>
<p>Several days ago, the State Department announced that China had assured Washington it was taking no further punitive action against its best-known dissident after Albright voiced concern via the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and sought information.</p>
<p>The department reported then that the Chinese Foreign Ministry had responded with an account of an altercation between Wei and another inmate, saying Wei had been criticised by prison authorities but no other action was being taken against him.</p>
<p>Qian did not get into details about the case, Burns said.</p>
<p>Albright stressed the need to ensure that U.S.-China summits &quot;must be concrete, well prepared, meaningful meetings (so as to) mark a new page in U.S.-China relations after the difficulties of the last several years&quot;, when ties were in a downward spiral and few meetings were held.</p>
