<p>An Algerian court on Sunday sentenced eight managers in a state-owned enterprise to up to 15 years in jail for embezzling state assets, said the official Algerian news agency APS.</p>
<p>The eight from the food distribution Edipal firm were among a total of 47 people standing trial for their role in a 440 million dinars ($7.8 million) scandal.</p>
<p>The court in Djelfa, 230 km (130 miles) south of Algiers, condemned the eight to between three and 15 years' jail after they were convicted for &quot;misappropriating state assets and signing deals without respect of the legislation&quot;, APS said.</p>
<p>The tribunal also sentenced an unspecified number of accused to seven years' imprisonment after the nine-day trial attended by 25 lawyers, it added.</p>
<p>APS said others were acquitted.</p>
<p>The court condemned 22 people, who are at large, to death in absentia for the same charges.</p>
<p>The sentences were the harshest imposed since early in 1996 when Algerian authorities began issuing a stream of statements on arrests and jail sentences on senior officials in state-run business in a crackdown on graft.</p>
<p>The government vowed to wipe out corruption since President Liamine Zeroual put anti-graft high in his agenda in an attempt to bridge the gap of mistrust between ordinary Algerians and their leaders.</p>
