<p>NYMEX crude was called lower tracking weaker Brent futures on London's IPE amid little news.</p>
<p>&quot;Brent is a little worse off right now because the Nerefco refinery has cut its crude runs,&quot; said a New York dealer, noting crude that is not used by refineries could head to the U.S. According to trader sources, Texaco, the owner of the Rotterdam refinery, had cut crude throughput by 10 percent for May.</p>
<p>Crude was called five to 10 cents a barrel lower. Refined products were called steady to 0.25 cent a gallon lower.</p>
<p>At 0927 EDT, June Brent was off 11 cents at $19.40 a barrel on the IPE.  </p>
<p>Also on the bearish front, Royal Dutch Shell Group's Nigeria unit said on Wednesday it had begun reopening five flow stations shut since Sunday because of communal feud in the oil-producing southeastern Nigeria.</p>
<p>Shell said the closure shut in about 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil but that exports were continuing normally.</p>
<p>Oil prices were, however, seen on solid ground.</p>
<p>&quot;We had an API fade yesterday, and there are plenty of bulls in the market and there are a lot of new players that have been buying length,&quot; said a New York crude dealer.</p>
<p>He noted oil prices were able to recover from sharply lower levels Wednesday following bearish oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API).</p>
<p>Resistance for June crude was pegged at $21.55, the high during Monday's upside breakout and the highest level for spot crude since March 24. On Wednesday, June crude ended two cents up at $21.39 a barrel after falling as low as $20.85.</p>
<p>June gasoline finished 0.38 cent off at 64.30 cents a gallon after tumbling to as 62.75 cents. June heating oil settled off 0.06 cent a gallon at 56.42 cents after falling to 55.60 cents.  </p>
