<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia sends triple murderer back to Britain.</title>

<p>Convicted triple murderer Archie &quot;Mad Dog&quot; McCafferty was deported from Australia to Britain on Thursday following his release after 23 years in jail.</p>
<p>Glasgow-born McCafferty, who was granted parole on his fifth attempt earlier this month, last week lost a last-ditch bid to have his deportation order overturned.</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm he has departed Australia,&quot; an immigration department spokeswoman told Reuters. Local media reported McCafferty left Australia bound for Britain on a Qantas flight from Sydney.</p>
<p>McCafferty, 49, was sentenced to life in jail in 1974 as the leader of a gang which killed three men in Sydney in five days after his baby son suffocated while breastfeeding.</p>
<p>McCafferty, who came to Australia with his family as a 10-year-old but never became an Australian citizen, said he had suffered a delusion telling him to kill seven people.</p>
<p>Australian media nicknamed McCafferty &quot;Mad Dog&quot; because of his killings.</p>
<p>The New South Wales Parole Board earlier this month said McCafferty had been a model prisoner since 1988 and had successfully spent four months on work release.</p>
