<title>USA: MCI jumps on BT report.</title>
<headline>MCI jumps on BT report.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-01</dateline>

<p>Shares of MCI Communications Corp shot up 5-5/8 to 30-3/4 after CNBC-TV reported that British Telecommunications PLC was negotiating to buy the remaining 80 percent stake in MCI.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes sense,&quot; said Kevin Haggerty, senior vice president and manager of equity trading at Fidelity Investments. &quot;I think BT is a great company.  The synergy is there.  BT made a great initial investment.&quot;</p>
<p>BT currently owns 20 percent of MCI.  </p>
<p>&quot;BT has a great presence here, in things like systems on brokerage desks,&quot; said Haggerty.  &quot;This would complete the communications side.  It all goes hand in hand to get an integrated company.  It's a good do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we'll know on Monday morning, whether you should have been short or long (on MCI); the tape is telling you something is going to happen,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Market analysts also saw the combination as a positive.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is an extremely competitive business, and horizontal mergers like this make sense,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors.  &quot;The economies of scale in this case could be considerable, and the leverage in terms of potential profits is high...It would be a good purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood, liked the deal.  &quot;It would be a good fit for British Telecom and provide a major foothold in this country,&quot; said Brown.  </p>
<p>&quot;It would be a feather in British Telecom's cap,&quot; said Brown. &quot;It wouldn't take away from the long-distance battle. Before that's over, there will be losers and winners.&quot;  </p>
<p>British Telecom ADRs fell 1-3/8 to 56-1/4.</p>
