<p>Troubled SAirGroup should turn profitable in 1997, but analysts question whether this is enough to secure the future survival of the Swissair airline as it prepares to weather the storm in Europe's liberalised skies.</p>
<p>Shares in SAirGroup are trading at a premium to other European airlines on hopes of a 1997 profit turnaround, but also on the expectation the Swissair airline at some point will merge or enter into an alliance with another major carrier.</p>
<p>But before cost-cutting bears fruit and a merger is topical, analysts expect SAirGroup on Friday to report a 1996 loss, mainly due to the drag from Belgian partner Sabena.</p>
<p>Analysts on average expect SAirGroup to report a 1996 loss of 108 million Swiss francs compared with 1995's loss of 147 million which included restructuring charges of 365 million.</p>
<p>The market is likely to shrug off a loss for 1996, which executives have described as a transition year. Chief executive Philippe Bruggisser warned in December a loss was possible due to a write down in the value of Sabena.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventhough 1996 will be bad, the market accepts it because it's a transition year. But 1997 has to bring decisive changes,&quot; said Urs Kunz of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB).</p>
<p>On average analysts forecast a SAirGroup net profit of 219 million francs in 1997 and 324 million in 1998.</p>
<p>SAirGroup's 1996 results will be reported according to International Accounting Standards (IAS) for the first time and analysts expect 1995 results to be restated. No substantial changes to 1995's profit and loss account are anticipated.</p>
<p>Analysts traditionally have a very tough time forecasting SAirGroup's results, but this time there is more-than-usual uncertainty because SAirGroup's board will first decide this week whether to write off all or part of the stake in Sabena.</p>
<p>Illustrating this uncertainty, the deviation in Earnings Per Share (EPS) forecasts is an extremely high of 37 according to Edinburgh Financial Publishing.</p>
<p>Sabena has already reported a 1996 loss of 8.9 billion Belgian francs or around 370 million Swiss francs. SAirGroup owns 49.5 percent of Sabena and will at least have to shoulder that amount of Sabena's loss, some 185 million francs.</p>
<p>Most analysts expect SAirGroup to write off its entire stake in Sabena, worth some 270 million, to give it freedom to manoeuvre and disregard Sabena's anticipated loss in 1997.</p>
<p>The expected drastic improvement in SAirGroup's results in 1997 and 1998 is based on Bruggisser's strategy of cutting costs and raising revenue at the core Swissair airline, which he still expects to break even by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Key to cost cutting is the reduction of 2,000 jobs in three waves with 1,200 job cuts taking place in 1996. Other savings include a five percent salary cut that gives bottom-line savings of some 100 million francs.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time that Swissair is really reducing costs and the layoff of 2,000 people should have a positive impact in 1997,&quot; said Beat Kunz of Bank Julius Baer.</p>
<p>Simultanously, Swissair is growing its business through alliances and code sharing with Sabena, Delta Air Lines, Austrian Airlines and Singapore Airlines.</p>
<p>But SAirGroup is much more than just loss-making Swissair, one of the important reasons for the share premium.</p>
<p>Based on prospective 1997 earnings, SAirGroup's shares trade at a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19 compared with 12 for British Airways, 10 for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and 15 for Deutsche Lufthansa.</p>
<p>&quot;SAirGroup's P/E is so high because half of its sales come from catering and not from flights so it its only partly comparable with KLM and Lufthansa,&quot; said Dieter Winet of Societe Generale Bank and Trust.</p>
<p>Another reason for the share premium is the expectation that Swissair could become a casualty of European consolidation and Bruggisser is open minded enough to examine all alternatives.</p>
<p>&quot;The time is not yet ripe for such speculation, but with Bruggisser at the top there are no tabus at SAirGroup,&quot; said Susanne Borer at Bank Vontobel.</p>
