<headline>Panel faults intelligence behind Star Wars debate.</headline>

<p>An independent panel on Wednesday criticised as &quot;politically naive&quot; the intelligence judgment underlying President Bill Clinton's refusal to move ahead now with a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-type missile defence.</p>
<p>Former CIA Director Robert Gates, who headed the congressionally mandated seven-member review panel, dismissed the charge by some Republicans that a year-old intelligence analysis of potential missile threats had been &quot;skewed&quot; to match Clinton's go-slow position on missile defence.</p>
<p>But the panel, named by CIA Director John Deutch, found the &quot;national intelligence estimate&quot; in question -- one of the spy agencies' most important analytical products -- had been &quot;politically naive and not as useful as it could have been&quot; to decisionmakers, Gates told the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>At issue is NIE 95-19, a classified assessment released a year ago this week at the height of a Republican drive to build a multi-billion dollar system to shield the United States from missile attack.</p>
<p>Its key judgment, since made public, was that no country other than the major declared nuclear powers &quot;will develop or otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years that could threaten the contiguous 48 states or Canada.&quot; This contrasted with an assessment two years earlier predicting Communist-ruled North Korea might be able to deploy a long-range ballistic missile within as little as 10 years.</p>
<p>Concern over future North Korean ability to strike the states of Alaska and Hawaii and some U.S. territories in the Pacific has helped fuel the push to build a land-based national defence against long-range missiles.</p>
<p>Clinton charged last May that a plan by congressional Republicans to move ahead immediately with a version of former President Ronald Reagan's missile defence programme, nicknamed &quot;Star Wars,&quot; could waste billions in a misguided bid to thwart a threat that is &quot;more than a decade away.&quot;</p>
<p>Gates, director of central intelligence from November 1991 until Clinton took office in January 1993, said his panel agreed the intelligence community's failure to address more fully the potential threat to Alaska and Hawaii was &quot;foolish&quot; in every respect.</p>
<p>He said NIE 95-19 should have highlighted the reasons for changing the projected timeline for any future deployment of the Taepo Dong 2 long-range missile, said by the Central Intelligence Agency to be under development by North Korea.</p>
<p>John McLaughlin, vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council that prepared NIE 95-19, acknowledged that &quot;we may have leaned too far toward brevity&quot; but said all U.S. intelligence agencies still supported its conclusions.</p>
<p>Gate's panel also faulted the intelligence assessment's stated faith in an international arms control pact called the Missile Technology Control Regime. The NIE predicted the pact would continue significantly to curb missile-related transfers to such &quot;rogue&quot; nations as Libya and Iran.</p>
<p>But Gates, summarizing his panel's still-classified report, said the assessment failed to pay enough attention to alternative scenarios under which hostile powers might somehow acquire deadly weapons and use them for blackmail or fire them from ships or submarines offshore.</p>
<p>In addition, he criticised the NIE's handling of the threat of an unauthorised missile launch from Russia as &quot;superficial and maybe overly sanguine,&quot; citing what he called the technical possibilities of a rogue launch.</p>
<p>Gates' successor as CIA director, James Woolsey, blasted the NIE assessment as providing a false sense of security. He testified that its emphasis on homegrown development of intercontinental ballistic missiles missed the boat in a post-Cold War world dogged by dangerous arms transfers.</p>
