<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices were unchanged to higher again Thursday in sluggish trade, with low sulphur grades better supported by some buying interest for Florida utilities, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Low sulphur doesn't look that bad. It's not a screaming buy, but it looks constructive. High sulphur feels toppy with Europe weak,&quot; said one cash trader, noting some recent buying interest into Florida.</p>
<p>New York Harbor physical one percent gained a quarter to $16.50-75 a barrel, with June one percent paper quoted at $17.00-25 and done at $17.25, up 25-50 cents, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour notionally edged up slightly to $17 or higher in sympathy with one percent but traders noted little underlying HP utility demand.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York again held steady, with 2.2 percent still talked at about $15 a barrel, but soft prices in Europe raised expectations for lower values soon.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf one percent firmed slightly to $15.75-16.00, with 60,000 barrels for June 9 delivery reportedly sold at $17.70 (delivered Florida). The deal was not confirmed.</p>
<p>USG three percent notionally held at $14.75-15.00, but some thought the price was closer to $14.50, citing June three percent paper deals at $14.25 and $14.30.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices held relatively steady Thursday at about $2.45/mmBtu, or $15.44 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, also was little changed at about $2.21/mmBtu, or $13.92 a barrel.</p>
