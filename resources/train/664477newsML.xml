<p>MUNICH, June 16 Reuter) - German and European firms are in line to win contracts for large-scale transport projects in China, a senior Chinese official said.</p>
<p>Concrete negotiations were under way for projects in the rail, road, sea and other industries following contacts made at the Transport 97 fair in Munich, Professor Wang Derong, vice-president and secretary-general of the China Communications and Transportation Association (CCTA), said in a Reuters interview.</p>
<p>The CCTA represents all ministries and leading organisation concerned with the Chinese transport and communications industries.</p>
<p>Wang said co-operation partners for some of the infrastructure and other transport projects worth more than five billion marks presented in a two-day China symposium during the trade fair had been found and invitations to China had been made.</p>
<p>In particular, Chinese pipeline managers, responsible for oil and gas transport, were now in discussions with an unnamed German company on establishing an oil storage facility joint venture in China, he added.</p>
<p>China had a tremendous need for transport investment, technology know-how due to the rapid integration of its economy into world trade and the accompanying growth in exports and imports as well as intensified individual mobility generated by growing prosperity, he pointed out.</p>
<p>Rail improvements, including a high-speed Shanghai-Nanjing line, at least 6,000 km of motorway, container and logistics centres and expansion of airport infrastructure were top priorities, Wang said. &quot;I think only in China is there such a large-scale transport development. China is the last but the largest transport market,&quot; he noted.</p>
