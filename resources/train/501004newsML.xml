<headline>Poll shows drop in N.J. Gov's approval rating.</headline>

<p>New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman's approval rating dropped sharply in recent weeks, though she would still defeat all of her likely Democrat challengers in the November election, according to a poll released Thursday.</p>
<p>Whitman's overall approval rating dropped to 52 to 43 percent, in part because of skepticism about her handling of the state budget and taxes, the poll by Quinnipiac College of Hamden, Conn., found.</p>
<p>The Republican governor's approval rating was 62 to 32 percent in a February poll.</p>
<p>Quinnipiac College surveyed 867 New Jersey residents who said they are registered voters. The poll was conducted April 1 through 6, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>Whitman, who gained prominence in national Republican circles for cutting state income taxes 30 percent, saw her approval rating on taxes drop to negative 42 to 54 percent, down from 49 to 46 percent in February.</p>
<p>Pollsters said part of the decline resulted from opposition to Whitman's proposal to borrow nearly $3 billion to pay off debts run up by the state's pension system.</p>
<p>About 49 percent of those surveyed called the borrowing plan &quot;a gimmick to balance the state budget,&quot; while 19 percent said it is &quot;good financial management.&quot;</p>
<p>Whitman fared best on the crime issue, with approval ratings of 61 to 22 percent in the new poll. Whitman's showcase crime issue is her signing of the so-called Megan's Law, which requires convicted sex offenders to register with local authorities when they move to an area.</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of voters gave Whitman a favorable rating, while 25 percent gave her an unfavorable rating. In February, her favorability rating was 52 to 20 percent.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in overall approval and favorability, Whitman enjoys a comfortable lead over three potential opponents in the November election.</p>
<p>Her lead was 48 to 32 percent over U.S. Rep. Robert Andrews, 49 to 29 percent over state Sen. James McGreevey, and 48 to 29 percent over Morris County Prosecutor Michael Murphy.</p>
<p>Administration officials were not immediately available for comment on the poll Thursday.</p>
