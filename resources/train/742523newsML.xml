<p>Lithuania's Utenos Beverages said on Monday that its shareholder meeting voted to form a closed joint stock company with Baltic Beverage Holdings, owned by Finnish Hartwall and Norway's Orkla.</p>
<p>Danish brewer Carlsberg had also offered to invest into the Lithuanian brewer, one of the leading beer makers in the Baltic state.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some 68.65 percent of those participating in the general shareholders' meeting voted for a decision to found a closed joint stock company with BBH,&quot; Utenos director general Stasys Krasauskas told Reuters.</p>
<p>He also said that 82.5 percent of those shareholders who had a voting right attended the meeting. The shareholders of Utena had to choose between Carlsberg and BBH.</p>
<p>&quot;The state representative, who represented a 21.5 percent stake in the firm abstained, in the vote,&quot; Krasauskas said.</p>
<p>He said that Utenos would pass all its assets, trade marks and business to the new company, which it would split 50/50 with Baltic Beverage.</p>
<p>Each stake would have a face value of 50 million litas.</p>
<p>BBH will invest into the firm 50 million litas, he added.</p>
<p>The Finnish-Norwegian joint venture also said it would pay shareholders 300 litas per share with a face value of 100 litas after they have been quoted on the Vilnius bourse.</p>
<p>BBH is already one of the largest beer makers in the Baltics, owning the leading beer makers in each of the three Baltic states.</p>
