<p>President Laurent Kabila's administration banned all political activities and public demonstrations in Kinshasa until further notice on Monday, citing a need to protect public security.</p>
<p>But opposition militants said they planned to go ahead with a march planned for Wednesday, with one likening the leadership of Kabila's Democratic Republic of Congo to that of ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>State television reported that international flights to the capital would resume on Tuesday with a flight by Belgian carrier Sabena but said that the river crossing to neighbouring Congo would stay closed until further notice.</p>
<p>State television announced the ban in a communique issued by &quot;the higher national institutions&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Individual or collective public demonstrations are formally prohibited throughout the city of Kinshasa until further notice,&quot; it said, quoting a need to protect public safety and property.</p>
<p>&quot;All the activities of the political parties are banned in Kinshasa until further notice,&quot; the communique added. No unit of Kabila's forces would be allowed to circulate in the city without specific orders, it said.</p>
<p>Information Minister Raphael Ghenda told reporters the country was going through a difficult period and that political activities could currently cause things to get out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a time for everything and we are in a period during we we are setting up a government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aides and allies of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi said that a Wednesday march would go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the kind of thing we are used to from the Mobutu period. These are neo-Mobutists who want to prevent our activity. We will ignore them totally,&quot; said Vianney Kabukanye, secretary general of the youth wing of Tshisekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS).</p>
<p>Joseph Olenghakoy, a Tshisekedi ally, said the march would &quot;show the people's attachment to Kabila&quot;.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi aide Laurent Mbayo confirmed the march would go ahead. &quot;It's a march organised by the party,&quot; he said, but he distanced himself from Olenghakoy's views on the march.</p>
<p>Earlier, Kabila's justice minister, Celestin Louangy, said the law in the new Congo would be administered impartially. &quot;We must end something that has always prevailed in this country, a sense of impunity,&quot; he said as he moved into his new offices.</p>
<p>Opposition activists marched in Kinshasa on Friday and Saturday. Kabila forces fired in the air took away some protesters. Government officials said they were later released.</p>
<p>Kinshasa went to work normally on Monday despite opposition predictions of a spontaneous stay-home protest.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, citing a 1992 vote in a sovereign national conference in what was then Zaire, has doggedly insisted over the years that constitutionally he is prime minister.</p>
<p>Kabila's ministers accuse Tshisekedi of deluding the people to feed his own ambition. Tshisekedi aides say Kabila has flooded the capital with foreign troops and accuse him of seeking to return to a one-party state.</p>
<p>Posts and Telecommunications Minister Kinkela Vikansi lambasted Tshisekedi on Monday, accusing him of preaching &quot;xenophobia and racial hatred&quot; and of offering Mobutu loyalists a rallying point.</p>
<p>Kabila aides say there will be no post of prime minister in the new administration but that Kabila plans to name new ministers to increase the size of his government from 13 to 20.</p>
<p>Opposition activists denounce the presence of troops from Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Angola in Kinshasa. They demand proper political dialogue and the departure of foreign troops.</p>
<p>Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo marched into Kinshasa on May 17 to crown a seven-month civil war with victory. They took up arms in a dispute over denial of Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>Kabila has said elections, a key demand of the U.N. and many Western nations, will have to wait for two years.</p>
