<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices were steady to lower again Tuesday, but trade remained light as softer crude prices stirred hopes among bears that more downside lay ahead, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are watching (weaker) crude, but there's some (downward) pressure building on the high sulphur side too, and there's still not much demand,&quot; said one cash trader.</p>
<p>Traders said a Florida utility awarded 110,000 barrels of 2.2 percent at $19.59 (delivered) and 180,000 barrels of 1.8 percent at $19.68 (delivered) in its most recent tender for fuel to be received prior to December 20.  </p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent eased slightly to $18.75-19.00 a barrel, while three percent held steady at about $18.25, traders said.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, high sulphurs again lost ground, with 2.2 percent off another quarter to $19.75-20.00 and three percent down slightly to about $19.25.</p>
<p>NYH physical one percent again was unchanged at about $21.25, with November paper off almost 50 cents with crude to about $20.50 and December paper down a similar amount to about $20.75, traders said.</p>
<p>No NYH deals were reported.</p>
<p>November New York City gate gas prices slipped about a nickel Tuesday to the low-$3.30s/mmBtu versus NYH November one percent resid paper at a $3.25/mmBtu equivalent.</p>
