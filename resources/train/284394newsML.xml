<p>Israeli police have arrested a second man in connection with Wednesday's shooting of seven Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron by an off-duty soldier, security sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They described the suspect as a 21-year-old soldier who served in the same army unit with gunman Noam Friedman. Police asked a court to extend his remand by 15 days on suspicions he helped Friedman plan the attack, the sources told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The sources identified the soldier as Yuval Jibli of Jerusalem. Israel Radio and the domestic Itim news service said Jibli would be brought before a judge.</p>
<p>An Israeli court on Thursday ordered Friedman, 22, held for 10 days, Itim said. He is suspected of attempted murder and sedition.</p>
<p>Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, fired his M-16 automatic rifle into a crowded outdoor market on Wednesday wounding seven Palestinians before other soldiers overpowered him.</p>
<p>He told investigators he wanted to sabotage any transfer of power to Palestinians in Hebron under an agreement Israel and the PLO were set to sign.</p>
