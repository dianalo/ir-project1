<p>New York state's attorney general Wednesday came out against telephone company Bell Atlantic Corp.'s planned mega-merger with Nynex Corp., saying it could quash competition and was not in the public interest.</p>
<p>Nynex Chairman Ivan Seidenberg blasted Attorney General Dennis Vacco's action, calling him &quot;dead wrong,&quot; and hinted that the combined company might change its mind about having its headquarters in New York City.</p>
<p>Vacco filed a brief with the state Public Services Commission stating his position on the deal, which would be the biggest U.S. phone company hook-up yet and would create a company with a market value of around $50 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned that the proposed merger, as presently constituted, may adversely affect competition in New York telephone markets,&quot; Vacco said in a statement.</p>
<p>Vacco said Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic could have been an important competitor to New York-based Nynex in the New York local phone market and that putting the two companies together could reinforce Nynex's dominant position in residential and small business markets.</p>
<p>He said his department had conducted a yearlong examination of the proposed merger.</p>
<p>The New York Public Services Commission is expected to rule on the merger early next month.</p>
<p>The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission have yet to make a decison on the deal, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year's first quarter.</p>
<p>A Public Service Commission spokesman said the agency does not give any greater weight to the attorney general's comments than any other submission regarding the merger.</p>
<p>&quot;They are just one party in this proceeding. We received briefs from eight others today,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Still, Nynex took Vacco seriously enough to issue a swift rebuttal to his filing.</p>
<p>&quot;The attorney general is dead wrong on three counts: the law, the facts, and what's good for New York,&quot; Seidenberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that no local area in the country has more competition than New York City, and the attorney general is standing directly in the way of true competition in long distance and cable&quot; television, Seidenberg continued.</p>
<p>He ended by hinting that the merged company might not put its headquarters in New York, as originally planned, asking &quot;how many Fortune 500 companies have committed to have headquarters here in New York in the last few years?</p>
<p>&quot;We have chosen New York City as the place to headquarter our new company, but comments like those today make one wonder if New York is a state where business is welcome or whether this is a state that tries to put needless obstacles in the path of growth and progress,&quot; Seidenberg said.</p>
