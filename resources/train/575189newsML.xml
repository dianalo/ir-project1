<p>The plane carrying the Barcelona team to Rotterdam for Wednesday's European Cup Winners' Cup final was delayed by more than four hours by a bomb scare on Monday.</p>
<p>Passengers were ordered off the 747 charter jet and told to identify their luggage while the plane was checked by security forces.</p>
<p>Barcelona newspaper El Periodico de Cataluna had received the telephone warning at 2.30 p.m local time (1230 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;There is a bomb put in the plane in which Football Club Barcelona are travelling,&quot; said the caller.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying 355 passengers, including players, club officials, media and fans to the game against Paris Saint Germain.</p>
<p>Barcelona goalkeeper Vitor Baia, who experienced a similar incident while playing in Portugal, described the bomb scare as &quot;very disagreeable&quot;.</p>
<p>The plane finally took off at 7.19 p.m. local time (1719).</p>
