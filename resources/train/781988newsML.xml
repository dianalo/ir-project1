<headline>U.S. EXPORTERS CAN NOT CONFIRM EGYPT WHEAT TENDER.</headline>

<p>Several U.S. exporters said they could not confirm market talk that Egypt would be seeking 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes U.S. soft red winter wheat late this week or this weekend.</p>
<p>But exporters did not rule out the possibility since Egypt has been recently absent from the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody also expects that (tender) at the end of the week but we have nothing firm,&quot; one wheat exporter said.</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on prospects for increased exports of U.S. wheat, traders said.</p>
<p>CBOT September wheat gained 8-3/4 cents at $3.62 a bushel.</p>
<p>Since they were absent last weekend it would make sense for Egypt to get the balance of their requirements, another wheat exporter said. &quot;But I can not confirm that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On July 27, Egypt's official commodities buyer said he purchased between 200,000 to 215,000 tonnes of U.S. SRW wheat for September delivery.</p>
<p>A third exporter said he did not know for sure but said there were indications Egypt may be in soon for wheat.</p>
