<p>Greece's ruling socialists romped home to an unexpectedly easy win over the opposition conservatives in national elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was a personal triumph for Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who confidently called the vote only to see his once-strong lead shrink and opinion polls predict a neck-and-neck finish.</p>
<p>But returns showed the socialists with a solid three-point lead in their first election without legendary party founder and three-time prime minister Andreas Papandreou at the helm.</p>
<p>With interior ministry figures showing an irreversible lead, opposition leader Miltiades Evert conceded defeat and Simitis quickly claimed a &quot;great victory&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The people showed they want a new course for Greece and society. This great victory belongs to all citizens who envision a better future,&quot; he said. &quot;This victory belongs to all who believe in development coupled with social justice.&quot;</p>
<p>Many Greeks, who had suffered a long and dull campaign, went wild on the socialist win. Cars raced through Athens with horns blarring, and white and greek PASOK banners flying. Fireworks boomed throughout the capital and people danced in the streets.</p>
<p>With 33.5 percent of the vote counted, the socialists had 41.8 percent and the conservatives 38.7 percent. Legal experts said that would give Simitis around 162 deputies in the 300-seat parliament, a solid absolute majority.</p>
<p>Simitis, 60, took over as premier from the ailing Papandreou in January and consolidated his power with his rise to socialist party president in June after Papandreou died.</p>
<p>His election win cements his control over the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), where he plans major changes, and gives him the mandate in parliament to carry out his promised reforms.</p>
<p>A German and British-trained economist and lawyer, Simitis called repeatedly for a more democratic PASOK party. He clashed occasionally with Papandreou publicly, and in so doing created an image of being his own man.</p>
<p>Simitis turned his back on Papandreou's passionate populism and generous campaign promises and told Greeks bluntly they could expect no more handouts from the European Union.</p>
<p>That no-nonsense talk sent him plummeting in opinion polls and had a welter of smaller left-wing parties denouncing him as a neo-conservative.</p>
<p>He eventually switched tactics and began recalling the glory of the Papandreou days, when Greece's vast welfare state was set up, and promising to take care of the less well-off.</p>
<p>But Simitis is staunchly pro-European and is determined to make whatever sacrifices necessary to meet the economic targets set out by the European Union.</p>
<p>He has also said Greece will eschew maverick stands and the unpredictable policy swings that Papandreou relished. Instead he said he would work hard and quietly with the EU and Washington to convince them of Greece's positions, especially with Turkey.</p>
<p>Socialist officials expected Simitis to name his new cabinet on Tuesday. Rumours have already begun that he will move Defence Minister Gerassimos Arsenis and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.</p>
<p>Arsenis has pushed for a $10 billion arms package to face off against neighbouring Turkey and Simitis is clearly unhappy with the effect this would have on EU economic targets.</p>
<p>He may also appoint George Papandreou, son of the late premier, foreign minister. Papandreou has little experience in foreign affairs but was a key backer in Simitis's rise to power.</p>
<p>The defeat spelled the end for Evert, who resigned as leader of the New Democracy party.</p>
<p>&quot;I take personal responsibility for the election result. I resign as president of the party,&quot; he said in a brief televised statement.</p>
<p>Evert, a hard-nosed former Athens mayor, took over as party leader after the conservatives were thrashed in a 1993 election but he presided from the start over a deeply-divided and unhappy group.</p>
<p>Results showed three smaller leftist parties in parliament. The Communist Party had 5.2 percent, the Coalition of the Left had 4.9 percent and the Democratic Social Movement had 4.2.</p>
<p>The Political Spring party of former conservative foreign minister Antonis Samaras had 2.8 percent, leaving his party out of parliament. A party needs three percent to win a seat.</p>
