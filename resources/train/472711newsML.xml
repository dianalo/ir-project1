<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistan central bank urges privatisation of banks.</title>

<p>Pakistan's central bank governor on Wednesday urged speedy privatisation of the state-owned banking sector to help solve the problem of loan defaults totalling 123 billion rupees ($3 billion).</p>
<p>State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Mohammad Yaqub told a meeting of bankers that these public sector institutions should be managed properly after privatisation and come under the exclusive regulatory authority of the SBP.</p>
<p>He said bad debts of commercial banks amounted to 105 billion rupees, or 85 per cent of the total.</p>
<p>But the share held by state-owned development finance institutions (DFIs) had doubled to 15 percent by September 30 from eight percent at the end of fiscal 1992/93 (July-June).</p>
<p>He said bad debts had piled up even though commercial banks had restructured or rescheduled loans of 21 billion rupees from June 1993 to September 1996 and recovered 18 billion rupees.</p>
<p>Debts totalling about six billion rupees had been written off in the same period, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;If an immediate effective recovery framework was developed and a recovery- friendly environment was created, the evil could be nipped in the bud,&quot; Yaqub said.</p>
<p>He blamed the bad debt mountain on weak management and a &quot;general lack of will on the part of nationalised banks and DFIs to recover loans from the rich and powerful&quot;.</p>
<p>He said short-comings in regulatory functions, cumbersome legal procedures for recovery, failure of the revenue agencies to enforce court orders, institutional decay and a general deterioration in governance had contributed to the problem.</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari issued an ordinance last month to set up a Resolution Trust Corporation of Pakistan to assume bad debts of state-run banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p>However, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has yet to convert the ordinance into legislation or set up the trust.</p>
<p>Yaqub suggested recoverable loans should first be separated from non-recoverable amounts by analysing the infected portfolios of the major banks and DFIs.</p>
<p>A strong recovery system should be established with new foreclosure laws, procedures to attach and auction the assets of defaulters, specialised courts and revenue officers.</p>
<p>Non-recoverable loans could be put in a trust or auctioned to the private sector for collection. The remaining gap in assets and liabilities of banks could be filled by market-rate bonds financed by the government from its own resources.</p>
<p>Yaqub said he hoped that ordinances prepared by the previous caretaker government to strengthen central bank autonomy and introduce other financial sector reforms would soon be converted into legislation by the National Assembly (lower house).</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that, apart from enactment of these ordinances, criminal laws are changed to punish wilful defaulters and corrupt bankers effectively and promptly,&quot; Yaqub said.</p>
