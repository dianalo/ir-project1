<title>USA: Fidelity executive quits to join holding company.</title>
<headline>Fidelity executive quits to join holding company.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1997-02-04</dateline>

<p>Affiliated Managers Group (AMG) said Brian Girvan, chief financial officer of Fidelity Investments Institutional Services, has quit Fidelity to join AMG.</p>
<p>Girvan will be chief financial officer and senior vice president of the privately-held, Boston-based holding company which invests in prominent, mid-sized money management firms, AMG said.  </p>
<p>Girvan told Reuters in an interview that his decision to leave Fidelity after one and a half &quot;had nothing to do with compensation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't really leaving Fidelity, it was joining AMG,&quot; he said. &quot;I like the buisness model, and I like the work, the job. This will be closer to the capital markets, which is work that I enjoy.&quot;</p>
<p>AMG said in the release that its partnership structure allows the firm's management to retain or receive significant, direct ownership in the company.</p>
<p>Fidelity Investments Institutional Services sells mutual funds indirectly to the retail market through broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and registered investment professionals, he said.</p>
<p>Girvan's departure comes at a time when a number of fund managers have also left the mutual fund company. But he said he knew nothing about the reasons for their departures.</p>
<p>&quot;As our business has grown to seven affiliates totaling $20 billion in assets under management, we felt that someone of Brian's experience and ability would make a significant contribution to the firm and to our affiliates,&quot; William Nutt, President and Chief Executive Officer of AMG, said in a statement.</p>
<p>A Fidelity spokeswoman said that the company would fill Girvan's post shortly.</p>
