<title>ITALY: San Paolo no rival to Mediobanca - Umberto Agnelli.</title>

<p>The entry of Agnelli family holding companies IFI and IFIL into the share capital of San Paolo bank is not meant to create a rival to merchant bank Mediobanca, Umberto Agnelli said.</p>
<p>But Agnelli, IFIL chairman and brother of honorary Fiat chairman Gianni Agnelli, told reporters at an IFIL shareholders' meeting however that if Italy had more competition in the banking sector this would certainly be an advantage.</p>
<p>IFI, the financial holding for the Agnelli family, and IFIL, its industrial holding, said in April they were selling a 2.2 percent stake in Fiat ordinary capital to the foundation which controls San Paolo in exchange for a shareholding in the bank.</p>
<p>They took a five percent stake and became a core shareholder in San Paolo after its sell-off from the foundation in May.</p>
<p>Agnelli was asked if their move should be interpreted as the construction of an alternative banking power to Mediobanca.</p>
<p>&quot;It absolutely does not have this presumption,&quot; he said but added if Italy, like the rest of Europe, had more financial institutions capable of supplying a range of services instead of just one &quot;it would be an advantage for everyone&quot;.</p>
<p>Agnelli said the Agnelli companies' participation in the San Paolo privatisation operation was made to contribute to the process of privatising Italy's banking system.</p>
<p>He added the Turin-based bank, if it was managed well, &quot;will be able to give interesting profitibility returns.&quot;</p>
