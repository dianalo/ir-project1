<p>Trading in shares of diamond giant De Beers Ltd was volatile on Thursday as market players continued to search for clues to the firm's lacklustre results published on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said while some players were busy abandoning stock, others still perceived value, thus spurring mild underlying buying.</p>
<p>By about 0850 GMT De Beers was down 250 cents at 152.00 rand after climbing to a high of 155.00 rand earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;De Beers has been hammered many times. The stock is very volatile with some guys trying to get in and others getting out on the back of the results,&quot; one dealer at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some guys who are seeing value in the stock but the results were dissapointing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Volumes traded on the stock were last around 49.3 million rand.</p>
<p>A late trade on Wednesday of about 175,000 De Beers shares worth around 26 million rand to an offshore buyer by stockbrokers SBC Warburg also pushed volumes higher.</p>
<p>De Beers raised its attributable earnings for the six months ended June 1997 to $507 million from $482 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast net attributable earnings of between $510 and $543 million.</p>
<p>De Beer's outgoing chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson said the firm could see little improvement at the full-year in its balance sheet if Angolan diamond production was affected.</p>
<p>Another worry about the future was the finalisation of a contract for Russia's diamonds to be sold through the firm's London-based Central Selling Organisation, Thompson added.</p>
