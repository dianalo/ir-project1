<p>Soldiers in Burundi massacred at least 83 civilians in a single operation last Sunday night, witnesses and other sources alleged on Friday.</p>
<p>The victims, believed to be from the Hutu majority, were attacked late on January 5 near Rutegama in Muramvya province about 65 km (40 miles) from the capital, Bujumbura, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The soldiers circled the hillsides of Kabuguzo and Kinyoni...and killed almost everyone,&quot; one witness said.</p>
<p>The bodies of 75 people had been buried in a mass grave and eight more were thrown into the nearby Kaniga river, the sources said.</p>
<p>The sources refused to be quoted by name, fearing reprisals.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not heard anything about this incident,&quot; Jean-Luc Ndizeye, spokesman for Major Pierre Buyoya, Burundi's military leader, told Reuters in Nairobi by telephone.</p>
<p>Burundi's 25,000-strong army is overwhelmingly drawn from the Tutsi minority and is frequently accused by human rights organisation of committing massacres against Hutus.</p>
<p>Some of the most recent victims are former refugees, forced from their camps in neighbouring eastern Zaire late last year because of a rebellion. They returned to Burundi reluctantly and hundreds have been killed, relief workers say.</p>
<p>Buyoya was installed by the army last July after a coup against the previous coalition government. In protest against the coup, regional states imposed economic and political sanctions but Burundi is managing to subvert most of them, diplomats say.</p>
<p>The army routinely denies committing massacres and blames Hutu rebels for atrocities that have cost at least 150,000 lives in the past three years.</p>
<p>But the defence ministry ordered the arrest of an army officer last month after his unit was blamed for the deaths of 79 civilians in Rumonga commune.</p>
