<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch guilder weakness pushes rates higher.</title>
<headline>Dutch guilder weakness pushes rates higher.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-07-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Dutch guilder ($12.1) weakened further against the German mark on Friday, which was seen bringing a rise in the Dutch special advances rate closer, but dealers said this probably would not happen next week.</p>
<p>The guilder was trading at 112.6525 per 100 marks on Friday versus 112.6150 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a dealer said the Dutch central bank's danger zone would start when mark/guilder was above the central parity of 112.6730.</p>
<p>The central bank will announce a new special advances pact on next Thursday as the current one runs for one week.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the central bank announced the one-week pact and left the rate steady at 3.00 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The guilder might weaken further versus the mark,&quot; said a dealer. But he said he did not yet expect a rate hike to stop this trend next week.</p>
<p>Money market rates edged up due to the weaker guilder. Two-month deposits rose two basis points to 3.20 percent and three-month paper added two basis points to 3.22 percent.</p>
<p>Call money rates rose to the usual level above 3.00 percent, above the special advances rate that sets the tone for money market rates.</p>
<p>On Thursday, call money dropped as low as 2.25 percent just before the last cash reserve facility as participants had ample liquidity. The new cash reserve requirement started running this morning for four weeks.</p>
<p>This morning's money market allocation of 4.15 billion guilders under the new seven-day advances pact was sufficient, dealers said. Individual banks' applications of up to 4.0 billion guilders were met at 16.3 percent.</p>
