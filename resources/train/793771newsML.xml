<p>New Zealand food prices rose 0.8 percent in July and were 2.7 percent higher than July 1996, Statistics New Zealand (SNZ) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters had expected on average a 0.1 percent rise in the Food Price Index in July, for a 1.93 percent rise in the year ended July.</p>
<p>However, they also noted the monthly FPI was a volatile series.  </p>
<p>SNZ said the July FPI rise was mainly driven by a 2.6 percent rise in the prices of fruit and vegetables, with cauliflower and broccoli recording the most significant increases. Fruit and vegetable prices are now 3.2 percent higher than a year ago.</p>
<p>SNZ said that excluding the volatile fresh fruit and vegetable sub-group, the Food Price Index rose 0.5 percent in July.</p>
<p>The price of groceries rose 0.7 percent in July and 2.5 percent in the year.  </p>
<p>Meat, fish and poultry prices also rose 0.7 percent in the month, mainly driven by higher prices for mince, steak and pork. The meat, fish and poultry sub-group is now 4.3 percent higher than in July 1996.</p>
<p>Prices for restaurants and ready-to-eat food recorded no change in July, but were up 1.7 percent on a year ago.</p>
<p>SNZ said Timaru recorded the largest rise in food prices (up 1.2 percent), while Invercargill recorded the only fall down 0.7 percent).</p>
<p>Overall, North Island centres recorded an increase of 0.8 percent, while in the South Island the rise was 0.3 percent.  </p>
