<title>CUBA: Cuban dissident says his house was stoned.</title>

<p>Leading Cuban dissident Vladimiro Roca said on Thursday that state security force members threw stones at his house and broke two windows during the night.</p>
<p>Roca said another dissident who supports his opposition group, Odilia Collazo, was detained on Wednesday and had not yet been released.</p>
<p>Roca, one of four members of a small group called the &quot;Working Group of Internal Dissidence,&quot; told foreign reporters at his Havana home he thought these incidents were part of a campaign of repression by authorities against his group.</p>
<p>Roca showed reporters a hole in a glass pane of his front door and another in the windshield of a car parked in the garden, and a fist-sized stone that broke one of the windows. He ruled out a suggestion that the attack might have been by thieves or vandals.</p>
<p>Roca's group, which says it has the support of 14 of Cuba's small dissident groups, last week gave a news conference to denounce a document the ruling Communist Party has issued for public discussion ahead of a party congress this October.</p>
<p>Collazo, the detained dissident, heads the &quot;support group&quot; for Roca's group. Roca said his own wife had been called in for questioning by state security agents on Thursday.</p>
<p>Roca added that two dissident colleagues of one of the Working Group's members, Martha Beatriz Roque, had their houses searched by state security officials on Wednesday and a computer was confiscated at one of the houses.</p>
<p>There was no word on the incidents from Cuban authorities, who rarely comment on the island's small and illegal dissident groups.</p>
