<p>KeyCorp moved on Monday to expand its presence on the national consumer finance market through the $200 million acquisition of home equity finance company Champion Mortgage.</p>
<p>The deal calls for KeyCorp to issue $200 million in stock to Champion in a tax-free exchange, and then repurchase an equal amount of shares, KeyCorp said in a press release.</p>
<p>Champion, based in Parsippany, N.J., will retain its name and operate as a separate subsidiary. It has generated more than $500 million in home equity loans in 1996, compared with KeyCorp's annual volume of more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>Other terms were not immediately disclosed.</p>
<p>KeyCorp, a $67 billion banking company based in Cleveland, said Champion provides the foundation and scale for its consumer finance unit to expand its retail home equity financing business to a national level.</p>
<p>&quot;We're building up our capalilities in the consumer finance realm,&quot; KeyCorp spokesman Bill Murschel said.</p>
<p>Murschel said the deal is consistent with KeyCorp's move away from traditional banking operations, calling it a &quot;virtually branchless&quot; operation. In the last 18 months, the company has made similar moves into the higher education and subprime auto lending markets. Its existing consumer finance units have about $14.7 billion in assets.</p>
<p>KeyCorp said the deal will close in the third quarter and is expected to have no effect on its fiscal 1997 earnings. It should boost earnings in fiscal 1998 and beyond, it added.</p>
<p>KeyCorp's stock ended unchanged at $56.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
