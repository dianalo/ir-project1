<p>A European Commisson envoy will visit Poland this month in a bid to settle differences over Warsaw's trade policies ahead of its talks on European Union membership, the EU ambassador to Poland said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rolf Timans told reporters after a meeting with Polish government officials he hoped European Commissioner Hans van den Broek would manage to reach some compromise with Polish authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;The main task of the visit...will be to hopefully to come to some conclusions on outstanding differences of opinions in certain trade-related issues, which in our view are closely linked to Poland's accession process,&quot; Timans said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the European Commission harshly criticised Poland for its plans to extend a protection period for its steel and oil industries.</p>
<p>The industry ministry wants to begin the phasing out of customs duties on oil and steel products in 1999 instead of 1997 as originally agreed with the EU.</p>
<p>EU sources say the scheme which has not yet won the official approval of the whole Polish cabinet may complicate Poland's EU membership negotiations likely to start in early 1998.</p>
<p>Polish deputy industry minister Danuta Hubner, also present, said the government would not decide on the delay of the opening up of its market for steel products, without consulting the EU.</p>
<p>Hibner and Timans attended a first meeting of a special Polish-EU body, called a Structural Policy Council, designed to make sure that Poland's trade and industrial policies would not hamper the future membership talks expected to start early in 1998.</p>
<p>The council also includes representatives of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Polish local authorities and business groups.</p>
