<p>Brokerage Effectenbank Stroeve said on Friday the problems which ceramics maker Koninklijke Sphinx Gustavsberg has in Germany now seem to threaten the company's existence.</p>
<p>&quot;The strategic step which was made a few years ago to enter the then promising German market has now jeopardises the whole company,&quot; Stroeve said in a report written after a presentation by Sphinx to financial analysts.</p>
<p>As competition from low-cost countries has halved ceramics prices in recent years, Sphinx's German units now cannot cover about 40 million guilders of their fixed annual costs.</p>
<p>Sphinx announced yesterday it would reorganise its German activities and had set aside a 30 million guilder provision for this, causing a 1996/97 net group loss of about 15 million.</p>
<p>Stroeve said Sphinx would drastically cut its production capacity in Germany and would axe about 130 jobs at two Belgian plants which supply the German branch.</p>
<p>By selling assets and the company's tile division, cutting supplies and cancelling investments, Sphinx should be able to reduce its debts a little. Its interest charges for the year to March 31, 1997, are seen at about 18 million guilders on an expected operating profit of only 10 million, Stroeve said.</p>
<p>The brokerage said Sphinx would reduce the number of its product series and would put more emphasis on profit contribution rather than on sales volumes.</p>
<p>Although Sphinx said developments in the Netherlands and Scandinavia were going much better, the company was still in a very difficult financial position, Stroeve said.</p>
<p>&quot;In that perspective, we wonder whether the company would not have done better to completely withdraw from the German ceramics market,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Stroeve said it does not expect Sphinx to become profitable again in the next two years.</p>
