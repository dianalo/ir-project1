<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) on Sunday slammed proposals by opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to exclude its junior coalition partners from talks on controversial plans to reform tax laws and pension systems.</p>
<p>SPD parliamentary leader Peter Struck said his party was willing to meet the CDU for talks as long as the CDU's two coalition partners, Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), did not take part.</p>
<p>&quot;These demands...are a desperate attempt to drive a wedge between the coalition parties. Such tricks will not help the unemployed. We are not going to be drawn into this,&quot; CDU general secretary Peter Hintze told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The coalition parties tackle all key issues together.&quot;</p>
<p>FDP parliamentarian Juergen Koppelin echoed Hintze, saying: &quot;Such talks...would mean the end of the coalition&quot;.</p>
<p>Struck's offer came a day after Kohl appealed to the SPD to help break a log jam in the planned reforms, set to go ahead on January 1, 1998.</p>
<p>Struck warned the coalition that the only way to prevent such a delay was for SPD leaders to meet Kohl and his powerful lieutenant, Wolfgang Schaeuble, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The weekend exchange highlighted a bitter row  over the reforms within Kohl's ruling coalition , and cast doubt on whether it could win support from the SPD, which could block the planned legislation because of its majority in the upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>It also coincided with harsh criticism of Kohl's economic policies from the head of a key labour union, who said the government was to blame for Germany's record-high jobless rate and, according to Welt am Sonntag, from a top German banker who criticised the planned reform as not going far enough.</p>
<p>Kohl wants to slash income tax and corporate tax rates while scrapping 70 tax breaks, measures that would leave taxpayers 30 billion marks better off. But many CDU leaders oppose raising value-added tax to help finance the cuts.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Norbert Bluem unveiled plans last month to cut old-age pensions, raise contributions and launch a tax-financed &quot;family fund&quot; to keep the compulsory pensions scheme going in the 21st century -- but drew bitter criticism from the FDP, Germany's pro-business party.</p>
<p>Struck said the SPD opposed Bluem's proposals and argued that dropping the top income tax rate to 39 percent from 53 percent was unrealistic because the government had no way of covering such a big shortfall.</p>
<p>He proposed re-introduction of a tax on wealth and more budgetary discipline to cover some losses incurred.</p>
<p>Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl, who is also a member of the CDU, dismissed the SPD's proposal of separate talks as &quot;destructive and contradictory&quot;, Welt am Sonntag reported.</p>
<p>Bohl joined CDU parliamentary leader Schaeuble and Finance Minister Theo Waigel in urging the SPD not to block the coalition's reform in the Bundesrat upper house.</p>
<p>Schaeuble told the same newspaper that  unemployment of over 4.6 million -- a post-war record announced on Friday -- brought home how urgently the reform was needed. He called on the SPD to avoid &quot;saying 'no' in a petty way just to gain some small political advantage&quot;.</p>
<p>Waigel and Schaeuble both called on the SPD to consider the well-being of the whole nation and not merely the view of the party leadership, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Kohl said on Friday that if the SPD joined talks with the coalition, he was confident the proposed tax and pension reform programme would get off the ground and help to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs.</p>
