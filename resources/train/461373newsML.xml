<p>Top-ranked Kansas, the one team in the 64-school NCAA men's basketball tournament that seemed to have a lock on a Final Four berth, was stunned by fourth-seeded Arizona in the Southeast regional semifinals on Friday.</p>
<p>Freshman Mike Bibby scored 21 points and hit a pair of critical free throws with 18 seconds remaining as Arizona held off a furious rally by Kansas for an 85-82 victory.</p>
<p>The Jayhawks (34-2), who had just one loss all season -- a narrow overtime defeat -- became the only regional top seed to fail to reach the elite eight after North Carolina fought off fifth-seeded California 63-57 in the East Regional semifinals at Syracuse, New York.</p>
<p>The other regional top seeds, Kentucky (West) and Minnesota (Midwest) advanced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Arizona (22-9) used its fast break speed to break open a tight game in the second half. Bibby nailed a three-pointer from the right baseline with 3:28 to play that put the Wildcats ahead by 13, 75-62.</p>
<p>Arizona still led by 10 with 1:52 to play when Kansas nearly pulled off a remarkable comeback with the help of a pair of steals and three successive three-pointers. The last trey by Ryan Robertson with 21 seconds left pulled Kansas within one at 83-82.</p>
<p>Bibby was fouled and made both his shots from the line to give the Wildcats their three-point cushion.</p>
<p>Kansas then had three desperation cracks at the tying three-pointer in the final seconds, but Billy Thomas missed from the left wing and Robertson came up short.</p>
<p>Raef LaFrentz got the rebound underneath and raced out beyond the three-point line, but his hurried shot from the left corner glanced off the rim at the buzzer.</p>
<p>Paul Pierce led Kansas with 27 points and LaFrentz and Robertson added 14 apiece.</p>
<p>Michael Dickerson chipped in 20 and Miles Simon added 17 for Arizona, a team with virtually no seniors that is now one win from the Final Four.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so great for these kids. I'm just so proud of them, said Arizona coach Lute Olson.</p>
<p>&quot;We had great quickness. They hurt us some with their size but... in the post the Kansas guys had to work their tails off to get the ball in there and I thought maybe that helped wear them down a little bit. I thought we were fresher in the end.&quot;</p>
<p>Olson's team will now face 10th-seeded Providence, the winner of a meeting between a pair of Cinderella teams.</p>
<p>Jamel Thomas hit three three-pointers in a 3:54 span late in the second half as Providence ended the surprising run of 14th-seeded Tennessee Chattanooga with a 71-65 victory in the second game at Birmingham.</p>
<p>Chattanooga had upset third-seeded Georgia and Providence shocked second-seeded Duke to set up the unlikely showdown.</p>
<p>Austin Croshere scored 19 points and God Shammgod added 15 for Providence (24-11). Johnny Taylor scored 22 and Chris Mims added 15 for Chattanooga (24-11), which was denied a chance to become the first 14th seed to reach the regional finals.</p>
<p>The game was tied 51-51 in the second half when Providence pulled away with a 15-2 run.</p>
<p>&quot;We're thrilled we won but I don't know how we did it,&quot; said Providence coach Pete Gillen, who said his team got overly excited in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;We're thrilled with the win,&quot; Gillen said. &quot;We've got to try to get better on Sunday otherwise Arizona will kill us.&quot;</p>
<p>At Syracuse, Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter combined for all the points in a 15-3 run as North Carolina rallied past surprisingly tough California.</p>
<p>Jamison finished with 21 points for the Tar Heels (27-6), who are one win from reaching their fourth Final Four this decade.</p>
<p>Randy Duck scored 15 points for California (23-9), which exceeded expectations by reaching the Sweet 16 without leading scorer Ed Gray, who broke his foot late in the regular season.</p>
<p>California used a 9-0 run to grab a 43-36 lead with 12:26 to play. But Jamison took control from the low post to spark the Tar Heels' second half rally.</p>
<p>&quot;In many ways they were a better team than we were tonight but we won the game,&quot; said North Carolina coach Dean Smith.</p>
<p>In the East regional final North Carolina will play sixth-seeded Louisville, which pulled away for a 78-63 victory over 10th-seeded Texas.</p>
<p>Alvin Sims scored a career-high 25 points and Damion Dantzler made a pair of three-pointers in a game-breaking second-half run as Louisville (26-8) defeated Texas for the second time this season.</p>
<p>Louisville won despite losing point guard DeJuan Wheat, who had to be carried off the court with a severely sprained left ankle with 15:52 left.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a great team effort that second half,&quot; said Louisville coach Denny Crum. &quot;Without DeJuan, we don't have a ballhandler, we don't have a point guard, and everybody had to contribute.&quot;</p>
<p>The last time Louisville advanced to the regional finals was in 1986 when they went on to win the NCAA Tournament.</p>
