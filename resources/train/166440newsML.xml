<p>PALM OIL FUTURES - Prices ended higher on speculative demand and gains in Chicago soyoil futures. Trading ranges were tight throughout ahead of private forecaster Ivan Wong's crop report, expected on Thursday. Immediate resistance for Jan seen at 1,180 with support at 1,150.</p>
<p>PALM OIL PHYSICALS - Prices eased slightly as refiner covering fizzled out. Trading remained thin.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market showed no immediate reaction to news that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has been sacked.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is even talking about it,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>He noted that the state-run Ghee Corp of Pakistan (GCP) has not been active over the past month. In October, the GCP bought only 4,500 tonnes of Malaysian RBD palm oil for last-half November shipment.</p>
<p>Traders said the Malaysian palm oil market was more sensitive to devaluations in the Pakistani currency than to political developments there.  </p>
<p>&quot;Rupee devaluation means that Pakistani importers have to cough up more to buy palm oil and this may affect their buying programme,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Third position January crude palm oil futures closed up three ringgit at 1,171 ringgit ($464.13) a tonne after trading in a 11 ringgit range. Traders pegged immediate resistance for the contract at 1,180 ringgit with support at 1,150.</p>
<p>Volume on the futures market was 1,423 lots against 938 lots on Monday.</p>
<p>Physicals prices were slightly lower as refiner covering, which led last week's rally, fizzled out.  </p>
<p>Nov (south) crude palm oil was offered at 1,180 ringgit ($467.70) a tonne with bids at 1,175, after trading from 1,182.50 to 1,175.</p>
