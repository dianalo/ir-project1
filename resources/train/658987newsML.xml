<title>HUNGARY: Hungary's BUX ends down on Richter fall.</title>
<headline>Hungary's BUX ends down on Richter fall.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-06-13</dateline>

<p>An early surge in Hungarian shares on Friday was reversed by the losses of drug maker Richter on reports that Richter was to be sued by a U.S. business partner, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX share index finished at 6,290.35 points, down 14.70 points or 0.23 percent, while spot share turnover soared to 5.3 billion forints from Thursday's 2.6 billion.</p>
<p>The index opened at 6,356.08 points and edged up to 6,367.95 points bolstered by a substantial rise in prices on the Wall Street, Thursday's announcement that the U.S. supported Hungary's early NATO membership and a strong dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>A rise in Hungarian share prices on London also contributed to the initial bullish mood, they added.</p>
<p>But a selling wave of Richter shares also pushed down other heavyweight shares like chemicals maker TVK, oil and gas company MOL and OTP Bank, from their intra-day highs, traders added.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason was obviously Richter,&quot; said Attila Berecz of Raiffeisen Securities, adding that the major help for the Hungarian bourse was the Dow's overnight firming.</p>
<p>&quot;Two major factors affected the bourse,&quot; said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Spencer Jakab. &quot;The first was the U.S. proposal of NATO membership for Hungary, and the other factors was Richter.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S.'s Danco Laboratories Ltd. said on Thursday it had filed a suit against Richter for pulling out of its contract to manufacture a French abortion pill, and cited financial losses in excess of $200 million.</p>
<p>Richter ended at 15,300, down 550 forints on Friday as the news triggered a wave of selling the stock and traders said the story may weigh on the Budapest Stock Exchange in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a storm cloud over the market now,&quot; said Gyorgy Czipo of ING Barings. &quot;We have to wait a few days until the story quietens down and is built into rices.</p>
<p>Traders added that the longer term outlook of prices on the BSE was positive.</p>
