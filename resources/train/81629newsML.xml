<p>A riot broke out at a maximum security prison in California on Friday, leaving an unknown number of prisoners injured, officials said.</p>
<p>A fight broke out between about 100 Mexican and black prisoners in the exercise yard at California State Prison Sacramento, Christine May, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections, said.</p>
<p>She said the situation was now fully under control and the prison, at Folsom about 20 miles east of Sacramento, was in lockdown.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been injuries among the inmates. We do not believe there were any staff injuries,&quot; May said. She said she could not confirm news reports that one or two people died in the riot and could not say how many people were injured.</p>
<p>Some of the injuries were reported to have been caused by stab wounds, apparently inflicted by home-made knives, she said. Security guards posted around the yard fired about 17 shots to quell the disturbance, May said, adding she did not know if any inmates were hit by bullets.</p>
