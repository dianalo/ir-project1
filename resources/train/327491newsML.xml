<p>Former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar did not rig matches for a Far Eastern betting syndicate but did forecast the results of games in return for payment, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>Rodney Klevan told a jury on Wednesday that chief prosecution witness Chris Vincent was lying when he said Grobbelaar had received large amounts of money for rigging matches on behalf of the syndicate.</p>
<p>&quot;The talk was solely of match forecasting. You've twisted it to make it look worse,&quot; Klevan told Vincent on the second day of a long cross-examination.</p>
<p>The prosecution alleges Grobbelaar tried to fix at least four matches and was paid by Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim and former striker John Fashanu, both accused of being middlemen for the Asian betting syndicate.</p>
<p>Former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers is accused with Lim and Fashanu of taking part in a separate bid to fix matches. All four have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Vincent is due to stand down on Thursday, when the prosecution will start questioning some of the 50 or so other witnesses it plans to call.</p>
<p>Klevan, supported by the lawyers for Lim and Fashanu, said Vincent was a lying, vindictive no-hoper who wanted to bring down Grobbelaar after he pulled out of a safari company the two men were running in Zimbabwe in July 1994.</p>
<p>Vincent said Grobbelaar first met Lim in a Manchester airport hotel in late September 1993, where he picked up 1,000 pounds ($1,700) as a retainer for future match-forecasting and also agreed to start rigging games.</p>
<p>Lim gave Grobbelaar the money in the hotel toilets to avoid being noticed, Vincent said.</p>
<p>Klevan dismissed the story, saying the two men had met each other before and that the money was payment for matches which Grobbelaar had predicted previously.</p>
<p>&quot;You knew Grobbelaar was entitled to receive money from match forecasting...You were not in any doubt that he was discussing match forecasting,&quot; Klevan told Vincent.</p>
<p>&quot;No one went into the toilets. The money changed hands in the main lounge, not the toilets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing secret about what took place. You've cloaked it in a sinister garb.&quot;</p>
<p>But Vincent insisted he was telling the truth and stuck to his story despite frequent attacks. The prosecution's case depends largely on his evidence.</p>
<p>Vincent covertly recorded conversations with Grobbelaar in which the player appeared to admit he had fixed matches. The tapes were made with the help of the Sun tabloid newspaper, which broke the story in November 1994.</p>
