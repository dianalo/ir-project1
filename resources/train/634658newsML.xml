<p>Canadian bonds opened North American trading almost unchanged on Tuesday after Canada's ruling Liberal government won just a narrow majority in yesterday's federal election.</p>
<p>While the bond market had been expected rally if the Liberals won a convincing majority, analysts said the narrow win gave the market little cause for celebration.</p>
<p>&quot;Fiscally I don't think there are any changes but the slight majority might be reining in enthusiasm,&quot; said Harv Kalirai, Canadian analyst with New York-based financial analysis firm I.D.E.A.  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.22 to C$105.43 to yield 6.501 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond rose 2/32 to yield 6.65 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the two bonds narrowed to 15 basis points from 18 basis points at the close of trading on Monday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.97 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.01 percent.</p>

<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark fell C$0.10 to C$112.37 to yield 7.007 percent. The U.S. 30-year bond traded unchanged to yield 6.90 percent. The spread between the bonds widened to 11 basis points from 10 basis points at Monday's close.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds firmed slightly last night following reports that the governing Liberals were on track to win a majority governent. The Liberals went on to win 155 of the 301 seats in Canada's Parliament in yesterday's elections, for a majority of just four seats.</p>
<p>The narrow size of the win provided little reason for the market to follow through on the initial gains, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I can't see the election as being a huge positive or a negative for the market. That's probably what's being reflected this morning,&quot; said Sheldon Dong, manager of fixed-income research with Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. &quot;I don't sense a lot of activity or much reaction.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said volumes were light and some traders may be unwinding spread narrowing trades at the long end of the curve, which were placed in the expectation that a strong Liberal win would prompt a rally in the currency.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar began North American trading almost unchanged from Monday's close.</p>
