<p>Chinese economic officials arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday, the second senior mainland delegation to visit Taiwan since the death of Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>The 15-member delegation, led by Liu Zhentao, economic bureau director of China's cabinet-level Taiwan Affairs Office, had been invited by Taipei's private Chinese National Federation of Industries for a 12-day visit, a federation spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Liu said on Taiwan's state television he hoped the visit could further improve economic relations between the rival sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to hold seminars with Taiwan business and academic sectors in order to further improve our communication, which can help promote economic relations between the sides,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>He said businessmen from China and Taiwan had established good relations in the past several years.</p>
<p>He dismissed reports that China wanted to use Taiwan businessmen to force Taipei to have direct commercial and other links with Beijing.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Nationalist government has banned direct contact with China since losing their civil war to the Chinese communists in 1949.</p>
<p>Liu and his party were the second group of senior Chinese officials to visit Taiwan since Deng died on February 19.</p>
<p>A 30-member group led by Wang Xiaomin, deputy director of the exchange bureau of the Taiwan Affairs Office and also a daughter of China's retired parliament chief, Wan Li, arrived in Taiwan on the day of Deng's death.</p>
