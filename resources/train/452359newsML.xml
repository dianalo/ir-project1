<title>UK: UK shares finish lower, just off day's.</title>
<headline>UK shares finish lower, just off day's.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>The UK FTSE index finished lower for the third consecutive day on Wednesday after a roller-coaster ride prompted by economic data here and in the U.S. which kept fears of higher interest rates alive.</p>
<p>The FTSE finished just off the day's worst levels to be down 24.6 points at 4,332.2, its lowest since March 3. Second-line stocks which were battered on Tuesday posted more modest losses. The Mid-250 lost 8.6 points to close at 4,652.9.</p>
<p>British shares were under pressure from the start after a poor performance on the Dow overnight which was hit by inflation jitters. The FTSE managed to bounce briefly into positive ground on the back of a firmer bond market but gains were short-lived as sentiment was soured by a clutch of stronger-than-expected domestic economic data.</p>
<p>The figures were a boost to Prime Minister John Major, at the start of his election campaign, but the strong data increased the pressure for a rise in British interest rates to dampen inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Unemployment fell by 68,200 in February, retail sales were up 0.5 percent on the month and average earnings grew by 5.0 percent in January. &quot;The UK data are not strong enough to trigger a pre-election rate hike, but the jump in earnings will boost speculation that a post-election tightening could be large as 50 basis points,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, economist at Bank of America.</p>
<p>Minutes from the February 5 monetary meeting between Bank of England Governor Eddie George and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke showed that George was still pressing for a rate rise though he had softened his stance to call for a 25 point hike.</p>
<p>UK gilts tumbled and ended the day nearly a point weaker.</p>
<p>Stuart Weatherby, economist at Panmure Gordon said the rise in the jobs vacancy rate clearly pointed to higher GDP growth.</p>
<p>&quot;You could find excuses why unemployment and average earnings may be strong, such as the Jobseekers Allowance and bonus payments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But at a time when most people are cutting their forecasts for GDP growth, a rise in the vacancy rate is a lead indicator of inflationary pressures and stronger GDP,&quot; he commented.</p>
<p>Investors switched their attention to U.S. inflation data and hopes for a stronger start for the Dow. But stronger than expected CPI numbers sent shares to their worst levels of the day. Fears that the U.S. FOMC may move to raise U.S. interest rates at the March 25 meeting dragged U.S. shares lower at the start. The Dow was down 12 points as London markets closed.</p>
<p>Among individual share features, British Telecommunications Plc was the strongest performer among the blue-chips, rising to its highest level in three years. The move was prompted by reports of a strategic alliance with Spain's Telefonica and a briefing for investors on its planned merger with MCI. The shares ended 20-1/2p up at 462-1/2p.</p>
<p>Blue-chip retailer Kingfisher Plc, climbed 22p to 696-1/2p after a 36 percent rise in pre-tax annual profits. Bank stocks were among the biggest losers, falling in heavy trade amid signs of intensifying competition and as the sector succumbed to interest rate rise fears. Lloyds TSB Group Plc ended 14p lower at 499-1/2p whilst Barclays Plc shed 21p to 10.76-1/2.</p>
<p>Among smaller stocks, drug discovery group Xenova Group Plc shot up 80p to 435p after announcing a collaboration agreement with Zeneca Group Plc. --Elaine Hardcastle, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4027</p>
