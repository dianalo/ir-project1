<p>A lawyer representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment suit against President Clinton left open the possibility Thursday of delving into Clinton's sexual history if it would help Jones's case.</p>
<p>Gilbert Davis also said such a legal tactic was pertinent in Jones's suit against Clinton even though Robert Bennett, Clinton's personal lawyer in the matter, announced he would not question Jones's sexual past if the case went to trial.</p>
<p>&quot;The issues are different,&quot; Davis told ABC's &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; &quot;The president, if he says that he wasn't there, or he cannot remember being there, then it is pertinent.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't take away a way to prove your case,&quot; Davis said.</p>
<p>Jones accuses Clinton of making unwanted advances toward her in 1991 in an Arkansas hotel room when he was governor of the state and she was a state employee.</p>
<p>She also charged that Clinton ordered a state trooper to bring her up to the room. Clinton denies the allegations.</p>
<p>Davis's comments came one day after Bennett said he would attack Jones's reputation as part of his defence strategy but would not question her sexual past.</p>
<p>But Davis said &quot;I'm very sceptical of what they do.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was necessary to bring up Clinton's sexual past because on the charge that &quot;he used police officers. This is a modus operandi, if that's true, to procure women for the then-governor's appetite.&quot;</p>
