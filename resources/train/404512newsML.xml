<p>U.S. businesses worried about losing market share in Chile launched an effort Wednesday to win Congressional approval of legislation that would clear the way for a trade deal with Santiago.</p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce headed to Capitol Hill to mark the visit of Chilean President Eduardo Frei and lobby members of Congress for their support for so-called &quot;fast track&quot; trade negotiating authority.</p>
<p>The legislation would allow the administration to negotiate a free trade deal with Chile and other countries without fear they will later be changed by Congress. Chile, worried that an agreement would be subjected to amendments due to heavy lobbying by special interest groups, has declined to begin negotiations until fast track is approved.</p>
<p>Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang told a House Ways and Means trade subcommittee Wednesday that administration work on proposed fast track legislation was &quot;well advanced&quot; and that he hoped it could be delivered to Congress next month.</p>
<p>&quot;I am hopeful we can get up here with a bill fairly soon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chile was invited to join the North American Free Trade Agreement,  which links the United States, Canada and Mexico, at the first Summit of the Americas in Miami in December 1994.</p>
<p>Fast track was put on hold during last year's U.S. presidential election campaign after the administration and the Republican-led Congress failed to agree on authority to include labour and environmental issues in trade negotiations.</p>
<p>The administration sought broad authority to include those issues, while Republicans refused to accept fast track that included that authority.</p>
<p>President Clinton said at a joint news conference with Frei that he is committed to a free trade agreement with Chile and that Congress must approve fast track legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States simply cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while others share in the fruits of Latin America's remarkable growth,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>At a separate news conference, Chamber of Commerce members said U.S. companies and workers were losing business to firms in Canada, Mexico and other Latin American countries because of the lack of a U.S. free trade agreement with Chile.</p>
<p>Alexander Fernandez, president of the Chilean-American Chamber of Commerce, said U.S. exporters to Chile would gain about $480 million annually under a free trade deal between the two countries.</p>
<p>&quot;We must quickly act to assure that we don't lose the strong hold that historically American products, American companies, have had in Latin America,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no coincidence that in the last six months Chile and other countries in Latin Ameica have had visits from the prime minister of Japan, the prime minister of China, the president of Korea,&quot; he said &quot;It is obvious Asian countries have detected the large opportunities Chile and Latin America represents.&quot;</p>
<p>About 120 business leaders accompanied Frei on his trip to the United States.</p>
<p>Chile, which has a commercial arrangement with Mexico, recently signed a free trade agreement with Canada. It is also an associate member of Mercosur, which groups Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in a trading bloc, and is preparing to negotiate a deal with the European Union.</p>
