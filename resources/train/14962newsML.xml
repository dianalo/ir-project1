<p>Israeli shares closed lower across the board despite a cut in interest rates because big provident funds were selling stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 1.55 points, or 0.88 percent, to 174.38 on an all-share turnover of 57 million shekels against 43 million on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 index lost 1.22 percent to 184.98.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel said on Monday it was lowering its key lending rate to commercial banks for September by 0.5 percentage point to an annualised 15.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The session opened with mild gains following the lowering of the interest rate and activity remained low during most of the day. Just before the end of the trading day the First International Bank of Israel started selling and pushing the whole market downwards,&quot; said Ron Weisberg at I.B.I Investment House.</p>
<p>&quot;We were not expecting a higher cut (in interest rates) and the market has reacted in a positive way to the central bank's decision,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Israel Corp fell 3.5 percent to 20,237 after its subsidiary, Oil Refineries Ltd, reported net loss of 17.2 million shekels in the second quarter of 1996 as against net profit of 18.9 million shekels at the same quarter in 1995. During the first half of 1996 net profit fell to 8.2 million shekels from 51.1 million at the first six months of 1995.</p>
<p>Israel Chemicals, another subsidiary of the Israel Corp, gained 2.0 percent to 254 after it said that net profit in the second quarter of 1996 rose to 79.5 million shekels from a net loss of 103.5 million at the same quarter in 1995. During the first half of 1996 net profit was 125.5 million shekels as against net loss of 70.8 million shekels in the first six months of 1995.</p>
<p>Israel Discount Bank fell 2.75 percent to 2,979 after the company said that net profit in the second quarter of 1996 rose to 71.6 million shekels from 48.7 million at the same quarter in 1995. During the first half of 1996 net profit fell to 134.6 million shekels as against 139.7 million at the same period last year.</p>
<p>Venture capital fund Mofet closed unchanged at 110.5 after it reported that net loss in the second quarter of 1996 rose to 1.5 million shekels from 133 thousand shekels at the same quarter last year. In the first six months of 1996 net profit rose to 2.5 million shekels from a net loss of 25 thousand shekels at the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Clat Trading surged 21.75 percent to 861 following the decision of its parent company, Clal Israel, to buy up to 21.59 percent of the company, which is held by the public, at 37.4 percent above its market price.</p>
<p>Clal Israel rose 0.25 percent to 6,717.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing happens in the market. The high interest rate is killing the market and today's cut is not enough,&quot; said a trader at Lehava Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;The provident funds of the First International Bank of Israel and Bank Discount were the main sellers today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The most active share was Piryon Investment Trust which gained 0.25 percent to 9,458 on volume of 6.7 million shekels. Piryon's parent company, the Israel Corp. offered last week to buy back the public's holdings in the company.</p>
<p>Africa Israel Investements lost 1.75 percent to 387,997 on turnover of 4.5 million shekels despite the decision of its board of directors to approve the spin-off of the company's insurance holdings. Traders said the falls were not linked directly to the company, but to the fact that provident funds sales were bringing down the market on the whole.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries fell 2.0 percent to 113,193 on volume of 2.6 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.14 shekels)</p>
