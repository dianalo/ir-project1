<p>The dollar adopted a heavier tone against the mark at the European close, unnerved by a recovery of the Swiss franc and the mark's crosses but holding above key trendline support.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark slipped after remarks by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, who reiterated a statement made by Group of Seven finance ministers in Berlin last month that the dollar's correction from record lows in 1995 had been completed.</p>
<p>French finance minister Jean Arthuis echoed Tietmeyer's views by saying that current exchange rate levels should be consolidated.</p>
<p>But in a market hungry for further clues about the strength of the U.S. economy and their implications for interest rates, the comments caused only kneejerk selling, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is well supported by fundamentals and likely to remain fairly rangebound until at least later in the week when major U.S. data come out,&quot; said Sharda Persaud, international economist at San Paolo Bank here.</p>
<p>Attention is zooming in on the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 25 amid speculation about whether the U.S. will raise interest rates. The next piece of economic data will be the Fed's Beige Book at 1900 GMT.</p>
<p>At 1603 GMT the dollar was at 1.7018/28 marks and 122.58/65 yen against 1.7023/37 and 121.78/85 in late Europe on Tuesday. Chartists kept a close eye on support around 1.70 marks level, where a rising trendline from January cuts in. The Swiss franc staged a recovery despite fresh reassurances from France and Germany after bilateral talks that European monetary union will start on time. Tietmeyer, speaking after Franco-German talks in Lyon, said the Berlin G7 statement had been clearly understood by the markets and that he was not interested in a correction that went beyond fundamentals.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer and Arthuis also reaffirmed the commitment of Germany and France to meeting the Maastricht criteria and sticking to the timetable for launching the euro in 1999.</p>
<p>The remarks dampened further recent market talk about a delay of the starting date for the single European currency in January 1999 because key players in the project, such as France and Germany, might not be able to meet all the membership criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;These comments were another attempt to deny any talk of an EMU delay,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro. &quot;But just as the talk had no major impact on the FX markets the denials didn't have much influence either.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark/Swiss dropped to 86.16/18 from 86.40/41 at the previous European close, while the dollar eased to 1.4655/60 Swiss francs from 1.4717/22.</p>
<p>The mark got a late boost on the crosses amid talk that the Bank of Italy was checking rates. The lira came under pressure through a sell-off of Italian bond futures, dealers said. The mark was at 3.3734/39 French francs against 3.3712/15 in late Europe on Tuesday. Against the lira, it was at 997.00/50, up from 995.15/45.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen was supported by mark/yen strength - the cross rose back above 72 yen - and a drop in the yield on 10-year Japanese bonds to a record low close at 2.30 percent.</p>
<p>But the dollar was capped by Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka remark that dollar/yen above 125 yen would generate trade friction with the U.S.</p>
<p>Dollar-positive interest rate differentials remain the backbone of the dollar's strength, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Near-term the dollar picture is positive on the back of favourable interest rate differentials,&quot; said Norfield.</p>
<p>The dollar's recovery from levels below 1.70 marks  was helped by a return of the premium on U.S. 10-year bond yields over German equivalents back above 100 basis points.</p>
<p>Sterling, meanwhile, was hit after Bank of England Deputy Governor Howard Davies said the central bank was still in favour of a quarter-point rise in UK interest rates but also pointed out that currency forward rates showed the market was discounting a future decline in sterling.</p>
<p>The pound was at 2.7143/50 marks, down from an early high at 2.7482 and late Tuesday's 2.7355/65. Against the dollar, the pound was at $1.5928/35, off a low at $1.5889 but down from $1.6050/60 at the previous close here.</p>
