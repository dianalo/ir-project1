<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Saturday led a string of fulsome tributes to the Anglo-French entrepreneur Sir James Goldsmith who died aged 64 after a long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;He was an extraordinary character and though I didn't always agree with his political views, obviously he was an amazing and interesting and fascinating man and I think people will miss him,&quot; Blair said.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Margaret Thatcher said: &quot;Jimmy Goldsmith was one of the most powerful and dynamic personalities that this generation has seen.</p>
<p>&quot;He was enormously generous and fiercely loyal to the causes he espoused. He was a good friend and I am saddened by his loss.&quot;</p>
<p>Fellow tycoon and long-time friend Peter de Savary, who stood as a candidate for Goldsmith's Referendum Party at the last British general election, said: &quot;He had courage, ability, determination, kindness.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very saddened. He had the ability to climb the mountain and come down safely on the other side.&quot;</p>
