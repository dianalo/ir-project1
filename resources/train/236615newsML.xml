<p>Shares of Russian second-tier oil companies firmed and preferred stocks eased on low volumes on Thursday as investors and dealers shuffled their portfolios, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are fine-tuning their second-tiers,&quot; said ING Barings chief equities trader Peter Kizenko.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index eased less than one percent to 190.16 on $14.7 million market turnover.</p>
<p>Purneftegaz firmed to $2.40 from $2.30 on Wednesday while Tomskneft preferred eased to $3.63 from $3.75. Krasnoyarskenergo fell to $0.210 from $0.265 on December 2.</p>
<p>Dealers saw little sharp change due in the market, although traders were divided whether speculators anticipating investor interest in the New Year might spark an end-of-year rally.</p>
<p>UES, the dollar volume leader of the day, rallied after a morning dip, continuing a week-long move upward to close at $0.0845 after a dip to $0.0830 during the day and $0.0843 at Wednesday's close. It's low was near $0.0810 on November 28.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we'll see nine,&quot; said one trader at a Western firm who said some of the buying in the market could be intended to move the price.</p>
<p>A number of market sources said UES was pushed up on Wednesday and Thursday by rumours that a single Western buyer had bid for an 8.5 percent stake to be auctioned at month end.</p>
<p>Two sources said utility Mosenergo had not broken out of a month-long tight trading range, despite positive company news, because one or a number of institutional investors were taking profit on substantial stakes near the $1.00 level.</p>
<p>Mosenergo firmed to $0.986 from $0.981. It reported nine month profits earlier in the week and on Thursday announced it would issue Russia's first corporate Eurobond in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Mosenergo is going to be underperforming for several weeks to come,&quot; said a trader at a Western firm who added that Rostelekom, which eased to $2.36 from $2.40 was doing well.</p>
<p>&quot;It has had about six million shares dumped on the market,&quot; since news that a 38 percent stake would be turned over to regional telecoms holding company Svyazinvest, he said.</p>
