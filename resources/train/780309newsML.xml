<p>Pharmaceuticals wholesaler Australian Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (API) said on Tuesday it planned to combine two of its retail pharmacy groups to form a national chain.</p>
<p>Managing director Ron Rowland said the group would be based on the Thrift network, which has about 60 pharmacies in New South Wales, and Greenspot, which has about the same number in Queensland.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to combine Greenspot and Thrift ... plus approach a lot of our other major customers and hopefully have a large number in the national group within 18 months,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The new group, as yet unnamed, would form API's third chain, along with the Healthcare and Pharmacists Advice groups, and would target larger shops, Rowland said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The move follows earlier negotiations for API to become the sole Australian wholesaler for the leading Amcal pharmacy group, which operates 684 shops nationwide.</p>
<p>Rowland said Amcal had decided to stick with current arrangements whereby it dealt with different wholesalers.  </p>
<p>API, a former co-operative which listed in June, competes in the A$3.5 billion wholesale pharmaceutical market with F.H. Faulding &amp; Co Ltd and the unlisted Sigma Pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>It plans to enter the South Australian market next month and Western Australia early next year, Rowland said.</p>
<p>API shares were unchanged at A$2.48 at 2.30 p.m. (0430) GMT.</p>
