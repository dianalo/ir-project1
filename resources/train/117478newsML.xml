<title>ITALY: Italian court orders Priebke retrial.</title>
<headline>Italian court orders Priebke retrial.</headline>

<p>Italy's highest appeal court ordered a retrial on Tuesday for former SS captain Erich Priebke, overturning a controversial verdict that he should not be jailed for his involvement in Italy's worst World War Two atrocity.</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation annulled the August 1 ruling by a military court which had sparked outrage in Italy and abroad.</p>
<p>Its decision came in response to a petition from prosecutors and lawyers for civil plaintiffs at the original trial.</p>
<p>They had challenged a lower appeal court's decision in July to reject their suit seeking dismissal of the presiding judge at Priebke's trial, Agostino Quistelli, on grounds of alleged bias in favour of the accused.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a decision which speaks for itself,&quot; military prosecutor Antonino Intelisano told Reuters. &quot;We'll be organising a new trial in the coming days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The judges would be replaced, Intelisano said.</p>
<p>Priebke, 83, went on trial on May 8 accused of complicity in multiple homicide over the killing of 335 men and boys in a Nazi massacre at the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome in March 1944.</p>
<p>The trial ended in a 2-1 verdict by the three judges that while Priebke had taken part in the massacre, the worst atrocity committed in Italy in World War Two, he could not be jailed because the statute of limitations for his crimes had run out.</p>
<p>The German, who had lived openly for almost 50 years in Argentina, was blocked inside the courthouse by angry protesters and re-arrested hours later when Germany said it intended to extradite him for a war crimes trial there.</p>
<p>He is now being held on remand at Rome's Regina Coeli jail.</p>
<p>The Ardeatine Caves massacre was ordered in reprisal for a partisan bomb attack on German soldiers in Rome. Seventy-five of the victims were Jews.</p>
<p>Priebke admitted shooting two people and checking off names from a list at the caves, but his lawyers argued he should not be held responsible because he had to follow orders.</p>
<p>Priebke was extradited to Italy from Argentina last November. Neither Priebke nor his lawyer was immediately available for comment on Tuesday's ruling.</p>
