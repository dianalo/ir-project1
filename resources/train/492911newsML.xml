<p>U.S. debt futures finished weak after a session spent quietly stuck in negative territory.</p>
<p>U.S. June Treasury bond futures dipped to a session low in afternoon trade at 107-06/32 after Treasury's sale of $8.0 billion in 9-3/4-year inflation-indexed notes. Analysts said the auction was a bit disappointing, but the impact on bond futures was minimal.</p>
<p>Treasury sold the notes at 3.65 percent, with 46 percent of the bids awarded at the high. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.26 with non-competitive bids of $36 million.  </p>
<p>Traders said it was intra-day technical signals that ruled, with the market possibly rangebound ahead of Friday's Producer Price Index and retail sales reports.</p>
<p>&quot;106-7/8 to 108-3/8 is really your range,&quot; said Eric Herndon, vice president taxable trading with Griffin, Kubik, Stephens and Thompson.</p>
<p>June T-bonds surpassed Monday's 107-22/32 session high early in the session before slipping for the rest of the day. But traders noted that key support levels held.</p>
<p>They put support at 107-02/32, Monday's session low, and at 106-23/32, last week's low.  </p>
<p>Further support rests at the September 19 low of 106-22/32 and at the September 5 low of 105-20/32.</p>
<p>Many said support in the upper 106-00 handle was critical.</p>
<p>&quot;You go through 106-7/8 and you've got real problems,&quot; Herndon said.</p>
<p>Many agreed that the overall trend is lower, but some said June T-bonds could be challenge resistance levels -- including last week's 107-26/32 high -- into Friday.</p>
<p>But one bond options trader said corporate supply and bearish intermediate term outlooks would cap any gains.  </p>
<p>Talk of central bank selling of 10-year notes and worries about the possibility for strong core March consumer prices kept the tone dim in the otherwise quiet market today, traders said.</p>
<p>Richmond Federal Reserve's March manufacturing shipments index rose to 29 from minus 10 in February. February wholesale inventories were reported unchanged. U.S. adjusted retail sales rose 0.2 percent in March, according to the Redbook Retail Sales index.  </p>
<p>At the close, June T-bonds were down 7/32 at 107-13/32, notes fell 5/32 to 105-22/32, munis lost 5/32 to 111-30/32, Sep bills fell 0.005 bps to 94.295, Sept Euros fell 0.005 to 93.720. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750)) E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
