<p>Russia said on Friday that U.S. Senate pressure on President Boris Yeltsin not to sign a controversial bill curbing the rights of minority religions is premature and counter-productive.</p>
<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying the bill &quot;On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Association&quot; would be signed into law by Yeltsin only after legal experts had ruled whether it tallied with the constitution and human rights standards.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction by the American senators to the law, which has not come into force yet, causes nothing but surprise,&quot; the ministry said. &quot;It should have been clear that all types of conditions are counter-productive.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate voted earlier this week to cut off aid to Russia if Yeltsin signed the bill, which would give a few major confessions such as Orthodoxy, Islam, Judaism and mainstream Buddhism big advantages over minority religions.</p>
<p>The threatened curb on new assistance was approved as an amendment to a $13.2 billion foreign aid bill now moving through the Senate. The measure contains about $200 million in funds for Russia.</p>
<p>Under the new Russian legislation, only religions which have operated in the country for more than 15 years can set up new religious organisations. This gives a built-in advantage to traditional confessions active in Russia during the Soviet era.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said similar protectionism was practised by some other states and argued that Russia had to counter &quot;totalitarian sects and pseudo-religious groups&quot;.</p>
<p>The law, hotly defended by the Orthodox Church and communist opposition, was criticised by Pope John Paul on Thursday. He told Yeltsin in a letter released by the Vatican that the bill threatened the survival of the Roman Catholic Church in Russia.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry statement did not refer to the Pope's criticism.</p>
<p>Parliament approved the bill earlier this month and Yeltsin can either sign it now or veto it, but his veto could be overruled by a two-thirds majority in each chamber.</p>
