<headline>FOCUS-Russian bank eyes full control of Tyumen Oil.</headline>

<p>Russia's Alfa-Bank, part of the powerful Alfa-Group conglomerate, aims to tighten its grip on the ailing Tyumen Oil Company (TNK) by clinching a controlling stake in a tender next month, a group official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Alfa-Bank, through its Novy Kholding (New Holding) unit, also promised to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in rebuilding TNK's rusting Ryazan refinery and reawakening the exhausted giant of Russian oil -- the Samotlor deposit.</p>
<p>&quot;We will definitely take part in the next tender,&quot; said German Khan, president of Alfa-Eko, the trading arm of the Alfa-Group. &quot;We will try to go up to a controlling stake,&quot; he told journalists at a news briefing.</p>
<p>Novy Kholding won a 40 percent stake in TNK last week, having made the highest bid of $810 million, including the cost of the shares and other investment conditions.</p>
<p>Alfa-Bank aims to raise this to a controlling stake by bidding in a separate cash auction starting on August 5, where 48.68 percent of TNK is up for grabs.</p>
<p>The TNK privatisation is the latest and one of the final chapters in Russia's rocky road to full oil industry privatisation. After the second TNK tender, Rosneft is the last big oil company to go under the hammer.</p>
<p>TNK, or Tyumenskaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya in Russian, owns huge oil reserves, dominated by the Samotlor field. Analysts peg the company's total recoverable reserves at anywhere between 500 million and 1.1 billion tonnes.</p>
<p>Samotlor alone produced 100 million tonnes (2.0 million barrels per day) a year in 1974. But output has since plunged as a result of short-sighted policies in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;The field was literally raped in the 1970s and 1980s,&quot; said one Western analyst.</p>
<p>TNK's total output last year was just 21.3 million tonnes (426,000 bpd), down from 22.6 million (452,000 bpd) in 1995. It is Russia's sixth largest oil company by production.</p>
<p>The story of its main refining unit is no happier. The Ryazan plant has annual capacity of about 18 million tonnes (360,000 bpd), but used just 23 percent of this in 1996.</p>
<p>Oil and gas analysts peg the cost of reviving Samotlor at several billion dollars, and Novy Kholding's proposals, though significant, will go only a small way to covering this cost.</p>
<p>TNK would draw on Alfa-Group, its Novy Kholding partners and possibly foreign investors to raise funds.</p>
<p>Khan said Novy Kholding aimed to pay off debts of all TNK's subsidiaries by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We will pay off debts of all TNK's subsidiary firms by the end of the year,&quot; he said, estimating the sum at $210 million.</p>
<p>The remaining money would be used for investments, including the Samotlor field and Ryazan refinery, over two years.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest of the sum, around $600 million, will be spent on our basic programme, including the Ryazan refinery which needs reconstruction, and the Samotlor deposit.&quot;</p>
<p>Samotlor is part of TNK's main production unit, Nizhnevartovskneftegaz  NZGZ.RTS.</p>
<p>Khan said Novy Kholding would raise funds from within the Alfa-Group and from Alfa-Bank's partner in Novy Kholding, Renova. Renova is a U.S.-Russian joint venture with a major stake in the Irkutsk aluminium smelter in Siberia.</p>
<p>&quot;Renova is the part of Access Industries, a large group with an overall annual turnover of around $1 billion a year,&quot; said Yosif Bakaleynik, first vice president of TNK.</p>
<p>TNK would allow foreign companies to invest in revamping Samotlor, he said, adding that issuing American Depositary Receipts on subsidiary company shares was not on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to be talking about an ADR issue,&quot; he said. &quot;TNK, as it exists today, is not ready for this.&quot;</p>
<p>Khan said Alfa-Eko may manage TNK's oil export business, but had to get company approval for its proposals.</p>
