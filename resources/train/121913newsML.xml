<p>China's gross domestic product (GDP) is seen growing by about 9.8 percent in 1996 and by 10.5 percent in 1997, Shenzhen's Securities Times said on Wednesday, quoting a forecast by the State Statistical Bureau.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming six quarters, China's economy would grow at an &quot;appropriately faster rate&quot; and inflation would be kept at a relatively low level, the report said.</p>
<p>China's GDP grew by 10.2 percent in 1995 and Beijing has set an official growth target of eight percent for 1996. Inflation was 14.8 percent in 1995, with an official target of 10 percent set for this year.</p>
<p>But a &quot;lack of vitality&quot; and flagging exports of state-owned enterprises would affect long-term economic development, it said. Losses of state firms would shrink.</p>
<p>The service industry would be the pillar of China's economic growth, the report said.  </p>
<p>In the forthcoming six quarters, fixed-asset investment is forecast to grow by 17.5 percent, 18.6 percent, 19 percent, 18.4 percent, 18.3 percent and 18 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Government revenues would grow at a faster rate than government expenditure, it said, adding that the budget deficit would be reduced.</p>
<p>Price subsidies doled out by the government to curb inflation and spending on social welfare would decrease, it said.</p>
<p>The growth rate of money supply would be smaller than GDP growth, the report said.</p>
<p>Imports and exports would rise because factors unfavourable to trade in the fourth quarter of 1996 would disappear, the report said without elaborating.</p>
