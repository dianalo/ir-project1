<title>USA: CSW 'troubled' by commission's question.</title>
<headline>CSW 'troubled' by commission's question.</headline>
<dateline>DALLAS 1997-03-06</dateline>

<p>Central and South West Corp said it is &quot;troubled&quot; by statements made Wednesday by members of the Public Utility Commission of Texas who wondered whether the regulatory body was bound by prior decisions.</p>
<p>The statements were made regarding the pending base rate case of CSW's subsidiary, Central Power and Light Co.</p>
<p>Commissioners pushed back the procedural deadline for a final decision until March 31 from March 14, CSW said.</p>
<p>Meetings to discuss the case are tentatively scheduled for March 18 and 19, and a final decision is now expected during the March 26 Commission meeting.  </p>
<p>Administrative law judges for the State Office of Administrative Hearings on January 21 issued a Proposal for Decision on CPL's November 1995 request for a $71 million rate increase. The law judges' recommendations would increase annual revenues by $7.2 million.</p>
<p>CSW pointed out the proposed rate increase was put into effect under bond in May 1996. The difference between the bonded rates collected since May 1996 and the rate levels ultimately approved subject to refund to customers with accrued interest. CSW's management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of rate case, the company said.  </p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service, in a January 24 opinion update concerning CPL's bond rating, described the CPL rate case as &quot;pivotal&quot; for CPL because it will determine whether or not the company can mitigate its fixed costs and regulatory assets associated with its participation in the South Texas Project nuclear generating plant, thecompany pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely troubled by some of the remarks the commissioners made regarding the pending final decision in CPL's rate case,&quot; said CSW chief executive E.R. Brooks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some of these statements seem to raise an issue of whether the Commission is bound by its prior decisions.  We believe it is.&quot;</p>
<p>During Wednesday's meeting, the company said, Commissioner Judy Walsh questioned whether the commission is bound by its findings in prior rate cases regarding recovery of invested capital.</p>
<p>Specifically, Commissioner Walsh suggested that the recovery of invested capital should be based upon the current competitive environment rather than the reasonableness of the utility's investment as previously determined by the commission.</p>
<p>Brooks emphasized that, &quot;If the Commission's final decision is inconsistent with prior orders that determined that all of STP costs currently in rate base are reasonable, CPL will vigorously pursue its legal rights for full recovery of its invested capital.&quot;</p>
