<p>Senior German bankers on Sunday held out the prospect of turmoil on financial markets if countries like Italy were allowed to help launch Europe's single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Only by limiting Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) at first to countries with hard currencies can the euro hope to win the markets' confidence, they told Reuters at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos.</p>
<p>&quot;If Italy and certain other countries are in, a time bomb is ticking within EMU,&quot; Deutsche Bank board member Ulrich Cartellieri said. &quot;The fiscal success that the government in Rome has enjoyed recently cannot be maintained in the long run.&quot;</p>
<p>Horst Siebert, president of the Kiel Institute of World Economics, said the mark could plunge to two to the dollar if monetary union extended south of the Alps.</p>
<p>&quot;(With) a monetary union 15 minus &quot;X' (members), the euro will probably be weak, inflation will rise in Europe, we will have financial instability in world currency markets and political disputes on the dollar-euro exchange rate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>For months EU members Italy, Spain and Portugal have insisted they would be founding members of the euro and have used tough savings drives to help meet economic criteria on deficits, debt, inflation and interest rates.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank board member Ernst-Moritz Lipp recognised their efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Spain can make it, Italy probably not. But it does not work politically to have Spain take part in EMU without Italy,&quot; he said, adding it would be unacceptable to dilute the criteria to admit Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;The political art and task for Germany and France now is to convince Spain to forgo joining EMU at the start,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He called the possibility that a broad array of countries would launch the single currency &quot;a Sword of Damocles hanging over financial markets&quot;.</p>
<p>Bundesbank (Central Bank) Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum declined to speculate about which EU members might be in the founders' club, but added: &quot;If there are unjustified compromises in the selection process, there is the threat of turbulence.&quot;</p>
<p>The inclination at the annual meeting of business and political leaders seemed to be to play for time.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said there was no point in speculating about participants until early next year, when countries will qualify -- or not qualify -- based on their economic performance in 1997.</p>
<p>European Commission President Jacques Santer said a &quot;significant number&quot; of countries would join, but he did not name any names.</p>
