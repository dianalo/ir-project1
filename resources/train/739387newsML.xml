<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday defended a deal between Germany, Austria and Italy to remove border controls next year and said the three countries were determined to ensure the agreement does not lead to more crime.</p>
<p>Kohl's comments came after Guenther Beckstein, interior minister in the southern German state of Bavaria, criticised the deal, saying Italy and Austria had to do more to stop illegal immigration before the borders could be thrown open.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Beckstein) is not against it (the deal). He just says it is happening too soon,&quot; Kohl told journalists at his traditional pre-holiday news conference. &quot;But this is a decision of the German chancellor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was our joint view that we will have to do more to fight crime,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Beckstein told Berlin's InfoRadio the time frame of the deal reached was too ambitious and he would have preferred a longer transition period before the barriers fell.</p>
<p>On Thursday Germany, Austria and Italy agreed their borders would be thrown open from April 1 next year as part of the Schengen accord, which allows passport-free travel among a group of western European countries.</p>
<p>Kohl, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima held a closed meeting for over two hours in the western town of Innsbruck on Thursday to discuss the issue, which has raised German security fears.</p>
<p>Beckstein, whose conservative southern state borders Austria, said Bavaria wanted to maintain some border controls with its neighbour because he said illegal immigrants from Turkey and the Baltic states were still entering the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of this we still need some controls. In agreement with Austria we will conduct joint operations to reduce the security deficit,&quot; Beckstein said.</p>
<p>Beckstein said Bavarian border guards would continue to operate checks on suspicious cars near the frontier after they had entered Germany, to prevent illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Italy will become a full member of Schengen on October 26, but Austria will have to wait until December 1 this year to join the group. Land travel will still be subject to controls until April next year.</p>
<p>France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal and Germany are full Schengen members.</p>
<p>Germany has repeatedly voiced concern about Austria's ability to police its borders with Eastern Europe, raising the spectre of guns, drugs and illegal immigrants flooding into the country once checks are removed.</p>
<p>&quot;We want freedom of movement and no queues at the border. But we do not want an increase in crime and a rise in illegal immigration,&quot; Beckstein told WDR radio in a separate interview.</p>
<p>As a concession to Germany, Austria has agreed to lift border controls between the two countries step by step, rather than immediately.</p>
<p>Austria, on the European Union's frontline with the east, offers a perfect gateway for emigrants heading west in search of fortune and security. Its border with former East bloc countries is 1,260 km (790 miles) long.</p>
<p>Germany had also opposed early Italian entry in the light of the recent crisis in Albania which sent thousands of refugees fleeing across the Adriatic Sea to Italy.</p>
<p>Beckstein said Italy had done nothing to increase border controls and called on Rome to introduce more modern surveillance systems to guard its Adriatic coastline.</p>
