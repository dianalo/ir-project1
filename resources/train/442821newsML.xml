<p>The United States suspended its military evacuation of Americans from Albania on Friday after two Marine helicopter gunships were fired upon from the ground, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Marine Col. Emerson Gardner, commander of the Marine expeditionary force offshore, told reporters by telephone shots were fired from a machinegun at one U.S. Marine Cobra helicopter and then later at another helicopter, which fired back and destroyed the gun.</p>
<p>He said a man in the same area lifted what may have been a grenade-firing rifle to his shoulder and a Cobra fired at him.</p>
<p>In initial reports of the attacks, the Pentagon said a missile was fired at the helicopters and missed, but the Pentagon later said no missile was fired.</p>
<p>Gardner said all the attacks came from a small hilly area about two miles (3 km) from where Americans were being picked up. He said he understood about 200 Americans were waiting to leave and the helicopter evacuation could safely resume on Saturday. He did not know if that would end the evacuation.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary William Cohen reported the attacks earlier, saying: &quot;According to reports that we received from the pilots, they were fired upon. That fire was returned. They were not struck by any of the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>The operation began on Thursday after anarchy spread to Tirana, capital of the impoverished Balkan state, with gunfire in the streets and widespread looting of armouries and food stores.</p>
<p>Defence officials said 408 Americans were evacuated from Tirana before the suspension and about 150 Marines remained in Albania. Evacuees were taken to three helicopter landing ships offshore and then by other helicopters to Brindisi in Italy.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said he believed another 500 to 600 Americans wanted to leave. Washington also intends to keep its Tirana embassy operational, with Ambassador Marisa Lino and 17 other staff members, he said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the evacuees included non-essential embassy employees, their family members and other Americans. She said &quot;the situation in Tirana itself is somewhat chaotic in terms of not having a government that is totally in control.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about reports that Albanian President Sali Berisha had fled, she said: &quot;Our information is we believe that he is in Tirana ... Ambassador (Marisa) Lino is watching that very carefully.&quot;</p>
<p>Burns said the only way to bring order to Albania was for the rebels to lay down their arms and the political coalition in Tirana to find insurgents leaders and talk with them.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe it is incumbent upon President Berisha and the other politicians in Albania to find those people, seek them out, and try to establish a political dialogue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the possibility of Western economic aid through the World Bank, through the International Monetary Fund, through the United States and other governments. But that kind of assistance cannot arrive in a situation of chaos and disorder and civil war.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether the United States was considering military involvement to restore order, Cohen said: &quot;What I'm saying is that we're watching it closely. Our sole motivation right now, and goal and objective, is to get the Americans out of there safely. Beyond that there is no planning for U.S. intervention. We're watching it very closely. We're talking with our allies.&quot;</p>
