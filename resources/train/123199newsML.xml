<p>President Boris Yeltsin sacked his security tsar Alexander Lebed on Thursday after a bare four months in office, saying he could no longer tolerate his lack of team spirit and obvious ambition to become Russia's next leader.</p>
<p>&quot;I can no longer tolerate this situation and I am forced to relieve General Lebed of his position as secretary of the Security Council,&quot; Yeltsin said on national television.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, looking shaky, signed the order dismissing Lebed from his twin posts as national security adviser and secreary of the Security Council as the cameras rolled.</p>
<p>The dismissal left a huge question mark over the fragile peace accord negotiated by Lebed in Chechnya, which has met strong opposition in Moscow.</p>
<p>Lebed has been drawn into an increasingly bitter power struggle with other Kremlin officials since Yeltsin said on September 5 he was preparing to undergo heart surgery.</p>
<p>The final straw for the Russian leader seems to have been an extraordinary clash on Wednesday between Lebed and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, who accused his rival of preparing to use force to seize power.</p>
<p>&quot;I have told Lebed to learn to work with other state bodies and leaders...he did not learn his lesson,&quot; said Yeltsin, who told Lebed in August to knuckle down and stop complaining after the outspoken general insisted either he or Kulikov should go.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had appealed to the military to stay calm as Yeltsin prepared to what to do next.</p>
<p>But Chernomyrdin, in overall charge of the defence and interior ministries while Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery, rejected Kulikov's allegation that Lebed was plotting a coup.</p>
<p>&quot;I am far from thinking about mutinies and putsches,&quot; he told a government meeting.</p>
<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, defeated by Yeltsin in the July 3 presidential election, said the row &quot;could end in a general civil war as well as destroying the army.&quot;</p>
<p>The row and the perilous state of the cash-starved Russian military have become intertwined in the war of words between Lebed and Kulikov, who is responsible for the well-equipped interior ministry troops and for the fight against crime.</p>
<p>Kulikov, a long-standing foe of the gruff security tsar, on Wednesday accused Lebed of planning a &quot;creeping coup&quot; against the authorities in Moscow. Lebed denied the charges and asked Yeltsin for a personal meeting. But his bid failed.</p>
<p>The infighting is likely to have severely increased the stress on Yeltsin, who is waiting in a sanatorium outside Moscow for doctors to declare him fit enough to undergo heart surgery.</p>
<p>The president, whose workload has been sharply reduced, on Tuesday ordered his Kremlin team to stop squabbling and start working together. But the appeal fell on deaf ears and has been followed by two days of mudslinging.</p>
<p>&quot;The crisis has been mounting for a long time but it broke out rather unexpectedly,&quot; wrote Tatyana Malkina, a political observer with the liberal daily newspaper Sevodnya.</p>
<p>&quot;Either Mr Lebed managed simultaneously to annoy a critical number of Russian state officials, or the Kremlin has decided to sack him instead of allowing him to resign proudly.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed, a gravel-voiced reserve paratroop general, joined Yeltsin's team as security adviser and secretary of the powerful Security Council in June after he won 15 percent of the vote in the first round of Russia's presidential election.</p>
<p>He is more popular outside the Kremlin than within it and makes no secret of his presidential ambitions. He could be a magnet for the opposition if he was pushed out now.</p>
<p>Authorities in Moscow and other Russian cities have stepped up security after the allegations by Kulikov, who also said 1,500 Chechen gunmen would help Lebed seize power.</p>
<p>Both Lebed and Chechen rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov denied the allegations.</p>
