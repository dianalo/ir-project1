<headline>Dlr ends mixed in US, yen up on trade/rate worries.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dollar/mark was propped up by a strong U.S. stock market, but dollar/yen ended lower after signs of trade troubles with Japan and fears of higher Japanese interest rates bolstered the yen.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark got support in the U.S. from bids near 1.71 after falling from 1.7169, a new 34-month high set in Asia.</p>
<p>The early rally sputtered as dollar/yen turned sharply lower after a report showed Japan's trade surplus jumped in early February and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the U.S. was very &quot;watchful&quot; of its trade deficit with Japan.  </p>
<p>&quot;Rubin made a few comments overnight and the Japanese trade number came out showing an increase in the surplus and of course that has helped the yen,&quot; said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 121.20/30 yen, down from 121.35/40 at the open. It fetched 1.7125/35 marks slightly more than 1.7112/17. Traders said the dollar got a lift, after earlier sliding to 1.7091 marks, as Wall Street stocks were bid up.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market is kind of bid which is supportive to the dollar,&quot; said Kisoo Park, senior dealer at Bank of Boston. &quot;I think there are definitely some orders to buy.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial stock average was up more than 93 points at the end of trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus swelled more than 53 percent to 197.33 billion yen in the first 20 days of February, compared with one year ago.</p>
<p>Mark/yen tumbled below 71 overnight, its lowest since last June, after Japan's chief government spokesman, Seiroku Kajiyama told a parliamentary committee that Japan needs to consider measures to deal with the adverse impact of low interest rates on personal incomes.  </p>
<p>The cross hit a low near 70.70 yen in U.S. dealings.</p>
<p>&quot;Also last night, a government spokesman from Japan was talking about being worried about interest rates, so there were a couple of reasons for people to perhaps buy back some yen here,&quot; said Keith Woodfin, currency analyst at Foreign Exchange Analytics.</p>
<p>With yields on Japanese financial instruments among the lowest in the world, pensioners in particular have lobbied the goverment hard to improve the returns on their retirement savings, Woodfin said.  </p>
<p>The specter of higher Japanese interest rates increased the relative attractiveness of yen-denominated investments and made investors hesitant to buy dollars for yen, traders said.</p>
<p>But against the mark, interest rate spreads should continue to favor the dollar because German interest rates are expected to remain low, while U.S. rates could increase.</p>
<p>The financial markets were looking for more clues about U.S. interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who completed his semi annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on the U.S. economy and interest rate outlook before the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The markets were upbeat after Greenspan's comments, even though they were a close replay of his address last week when he told a Senate panel the Fed could tighten credit even before solid signs of inflation emerge.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar rose to 1.4820/30 Swiss francs from 1.4815/20 at the open and to Canadian $1.3683/88 from C$1.3676/81.</p>
<p>The pound rose to $1.6133/43 from $1.6100/05 and the Australian dollar was at $0.7842/47, compared with $0.7845/50.</p>
