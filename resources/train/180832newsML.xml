<p>German coalition chiefs, who at the weekend agreed spending cuts to try and qualify for European monetary union, came under broad attack on Monday for slashing the jobs budget with unemployment at a post-unification high.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel got his way on Sunday night when coalition leaders cleared three billion marks ($2 billion) in savings after feuding which at one point had provoked Chancellor Helmut Kohl to threaten to quit after 14 years in power.</p>
<p>A billion marks will come out of the Federal Labour Office budget, but that will hit job schemes and further lengthen dole queues, Labour Office head Bernhard Jagoda warned.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to save money on job creation measures because that will put more people out of work -- and they would have to receive unemployment benefits,&quot; Jagoda told the Bild daily.</p>
<p>Germany's unemployment hit a seasonally-adjusted four million in October, the highest since the country was unified in 1990. Jagoda warned of a &quot;winter mountain&quot; of jobless still to come.</p>
<p>Ursula Engelen-Kefer, deputy head of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB), said every eighth job scheme would have to be scrapped if planned federal transfers were not doubled to six billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be a catastrophic scorched-earth jobs policy,&quot; Engelen-Kefer told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper, adding that depressed east Germany would be hardest hit.</p>
<p>And opposition Social Democrat (SPD) finance spokeswoman Ingrid Matthaeus-Meier said higher future unemployment would open up further gaps in Waigel's budget plans.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has to save 10 billion marks, not three billion,&quot; she told Germany's Southwest Radio.</p>
<p>After several turbulent weeks in which his tax plans had been wrecked by the SPD, and tax hikes blocked by junior coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP), Waigel looked to have regained control over policy late last week.</p>
<p>Despite lower expected tax revenues he said he would stick to a federal deficit target of 56.5 billion marks and wants the total public deficit -- of federal, state and local government finances -- to fall to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>That is below the three percent deficit ceiling set in the Maastricht treaty, and down on a likely four percent this year.</p>
<p>But the opposition is still saying that Waigel's arithmetic will unravel again after his borrowing targets were blown away this year by an extra 14 billion marks he had to inject to prop up the underfunded unemployment insurance scheme.</p>
<p>In his bid to push through an overhaul of the tax system in 1999, Waigel also broached the idea of the weekend of taxing welfare benefits like unemployment pay.</p>
<p>That was greeted by the powerful IG Metall union -- now fighting a rearguard action against cuts in sick pay benefits -- as &quot;another blow to the welfare state.&quot;</p>
<p>Waigel's other cuts will come from Defence (200 million marks), Transport (450 million), Economics (260 million), and Research (160 million) with smaller savings being spread over other ministries.</p>
<p>Despite the outrage from labour and opposition leaders, the budget draft was likely to win approval from the coalition's parliamentary factions before going into committee this week.</p>
<p>A final vote on the measure is expected later this month -- but critical decisions on cutting a tax raised to pay for east German reconstruction and on procuring the Eurofighter combat jet have now been put back to December.</p>
