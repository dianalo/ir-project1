<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co said Thursday its domestic same store revenues rose 5.8 percent for the four weeks ended February 1.</p>
<p>This compared with a 0.6 percent increase in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Total domestic sales for the four-week period were $1.69 billion, up 12.1 percent from $1.50 billion for the four weeks ended February 3.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sears' strong sales momentum continued in January,&quot; Arthur Martinez, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;Our full-line stores again generated double-digit increases in softlines, including women's ready to wear, children's apparel, shoes, accessories, cosmetics and fine jewelry.&quot;</p>
<p>In hardlines, he said sales were led by double-digit increases in appliances, including microwaves, ranges, dishwashers, washing machines and dryers.</p>
<p>&quot;Solid comparble store increases also were generated by our off-the-mall hardware, dealer and tire stores,&quot; Martinez said.</p>
<p>For the four-weeks ending February 1, Sears reported total revenues of $2.44 billion, up 11.8 percent from the $2.18 billion reported in the prior year.</p>
<p>For the 52 weeks ended February 1, Sears reported total revenues of $37.86 billion, 9.1 percent above the $34.69 billion in the prior-year period.</p>
