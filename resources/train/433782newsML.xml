<headline>Italy shares turn down as bond futures close easy.</headline>

<p>Italian shares closed mostly lower on Tuesday, dragged down by a weakness on the bond futures market and a spate of profit-taking on Wall Street which took the wind out of European stock markets.</p>
<p>The all-share mibtel index finished 0.38 percent lower at 12,080 with the blue chip mib30 index closing 0.56 percent down at 17,891. A weaker lira also took its toll.</p>
<p>Industrial stocks were well bought and rode out the downturn, led by Marzotto, soon to be merged with newly-listed HPI. Marzotto finished 3.51 percent higher at 14,770 lire while HPI ended 1.53 percent up at 1,126 lire.</p>
<p>Other shares bucking the downtrend were Fiat, closing 1.41 percent higher at 5,540 lire, lifted by technical factors after it broke through technical resistance at 5,500 lire and ENI, up 1.56 percent to 8,659 lire.</p>
<p>ENI was boosted by expectations of good 1996 results and by news that the group's oil exploration arm had begun developing an oil well in east Ecuador in conjunction with ARCO to go on stream in 1999.</p>
<p>Telecom stocks were badly hit, dragged down by fears that political tensions could complicate the privatisation process. Stet ended 2.33 percent lower at 7,785 lire while Telecom Italia finished 2.36 percent down at 4,305 lire.</p>
