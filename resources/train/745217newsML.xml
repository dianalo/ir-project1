<p>The seemingly non-stop rise of sterling wiped 42 million pounds ($70.3 million) off SmithKline Beecham Plc 's profits in the three months to June, the British-based drugs giant said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>SmithKline announced second-quarter pre-tax profits of 356 million pounds, up four percent from the same period a year before, on sales down one percent at 1.895 billion.</p>
<p>But stripping out the depredations of the higher pound over the year, SmithKline said underlying profits were up 16 percent at 398 million pounds, with sales ahead eight percent.</p>
<p>Investors were delighted with the performance, pushing SmithKline's shares up towards their all-time high.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch analyst Nigel Barnes said &quot;the underlying picture is so buoyant that certainly the headline figure has not impacted on their reception.&quot;</p>
<p>At the close, the stock was up 4.3 percent, or 50 pence, at 1220 1/2. Last week the share touched an all-time high of 1264 pence.</p>
<p>Shareholders have seen the value of their investment in SmithKline rise by 50 percent since the start of the year, and the company announced plans to split the stock and its American Depository Receipts on a one-for-two basis from August 26 to take account of the surge.</p>
<p>The group's strong portfolio of drugs saw sales rise 15 percent excluding currencies, helped by extraordinary growth in the United States where sales rose by 19 percent.</p>
<p>The star player were again ageing anti-biotic Augmentin, whose 17 percent sales gain to 215 million pounds helped it to keep just ahead of SmithKline's anti-depressant tablet Paxil/Seroxat as SmithKline's top seller.</p>
<p>Paxil, which the group licensed in, is proving to be a huge success in a market dominated by Eli Lilly &amp; Co's Prozac, and sales soared 33 percent in the quarter to 211 million pounds. Sales in Britain jumped by 48 percent and in the U.S. they were ahead by 36 percent.</p>
<p>Consumer Healthcare was another robust element, with sales up 14 percent excluding currency to 589 million pounds. The anti-smoking products Nicorette and Nicoderm were star performers, continuing to claim more than 90 percent of the lucrative U.S. market for gums and patches to help people quit smoking.</p>
<p>SmithKline's Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services operation, which manages drug insurance benefits in the United States, and its U.S. clinical testing operation continued to be the group's weakest spots. However Leschley defended his decision to spend more than $2 billion on DPS in 1994, saying it gave SmithKline &quot;a competitive edge that others don't have.&quot;</p>
<p>The results and share price rise reinforced SmithKline's position as the highest-rated British drug stock, standing on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 28.55 times estimated 1997 earnings compared with 27.22 for Zeneca Group Plc and 24.18 times for Glaxo Wellcome Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;Really the results were bang in line with expectations and don't change the view that that it is the safest of the three big (British) companies,&quot; said Kleinwort Benson analyst Stephen Putnam.</p>
