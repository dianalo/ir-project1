<headline>Mexico peso closes firmer but respects resistance.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-01-06</dateline>

<p>The Mexican peso added to earlier strength against the dollar but failed to break resistance at the close on Monday, largely due to a rally in the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;We really did not expect the peso to gain ground today. Nonetheless, foreign investors stepped in to the domestic money and stock markets,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The ensuing supply of dollars firmed up the peso.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed 1.2 and 1.1 centavos firmer, respectively, at 7.8460/7.8510 and 7.8420/7.8470 per dollar.  </p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had earlier closed 0.5 of a centavo firmer at 7.8390/7.8430 per dollar.</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC index of Mexican stocks was up 2.71 percent at 3,489.04 points as the foreign exchange market closed.  &quot;Foreign investors seem to feel this is a good time to do business.  Also, many banks are still long on dollars,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Some dealers said banks may have exercised dollar puts with the central bank during the session, which would explain why the 48-hour peso failed to break resistance at 7.85 per dollar.  </p>
<p>&quot;As the dollar is cheap, exercising puts is a good opportunity for banks to dump long dollar positions,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico auctions dollar puts on the last working day of each month for up to $300 million, which may be exercised during any working day the following month.</p>
<p>Dealers felt that the current ample supply of dollars would allow the peso to fend off the potentially adverse effects of a fall in primary interest this week, or greater than expected inflation data for December.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation looks like being higher than previous estimates, but capital inflow right now could soften the impact on the peso,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico is due to release inflation figures for December on Thursday.  Dealers said they were expecting consumer inflation to be around 3.5 percent for the month, and for 1996 to be 28 percent.</p>
