<p>It takes a long time to fly to Greece. Think of the time you plan to get there, then add at least an hour.</p>
<p>Greek airports are notorious among international aircrews for their lack of modern infrastructure. Long delays persist despite recent installation of radar-assisted traffic control.</p>
<p>&quot;It is probably too early to assess the efficacy of the new system because its introduction coincided with a surge in air traffic owing to the peak of the tourist season,&quot; said Eleftherios Vamvakoulas, secretary general of Greece's airline pilots association, EHPA.</p>
<p>&quot;There are stark differences in flight delays among different routes,&quot; he added. &quot;Domestic and outbound flights face delays of around 10 to 15 minutes, within internationally acceptable limits, whereas inbound flights are typically delayed for a minimum 60 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Airline sources said Greece has yet to improve flight control capacity despite starting work on a new $2.4 billion Athens airport due to open in February 2001.</p>
<p>However, last month Greece started to use the first segments of a radar network, supplied by France's Thomson-CSF at a total cost of around 25 billion drachmas ($90 million), to improve flight monitoring in its airspace, a long-awaited improvement which should eventually double flight capacity.</p>
<p>Until recently, Greek air traffic controllers handled flights through antiquated techniques based on position reports by airline pilots with the help of Distance Measuring Equipment (DME).</p>
<p>A secondary radar system which detects code-emitting transponders on aircraft has only an advisory role in Greece's air traffic control. Athens' Hellinikon airport is the only one fitted with a terminal approach radar.</p>
<p>&quot;The new air traffic handling methodology is being deployed in steps and so far we are merely utilising some of its features,&quot; said Panagiotis Tsoumbelis, president of Greece's air traffic controllers association.</p>
<p>&quot;It already offers a complete radar environment, but will take time before its operation is streamlined and staff training is complete, given current workload,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;When the new system is fully functional, capacity levels may be doubled from current levels, &quot;For the time being we're happy to maintain previous capacity levels despite the introduction and simultaneous use of the new system,&quot; he added. &quot;International experience shows that such moves result in lower capacity figures.&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years, air traffic control has become fully integrated into the Brussels-based EuroControl centralised system which issues Calculated Take-Off Times (CTOT) to all aircraft ferrying passengers and cargo between European airports.</p>
<p>The new system is expected to contribute increased revenues to Greece's Civil Aviation Authority (YPA) which collects fees from airliners entering its Flight Information Region (FIR).</p>
<p>&quot;When fully operational, the new system will be a great revenue booster, raising the number of users of Greece's air space and allowing for higher FIR entry fees through the offer of improved facilities to airliners,&quot; said Tsoumbelis.</p>
<p>&quot;In any case, our entry fees are the lowest in Europe,&quot; he added. ($1 = 292 drachmas) --Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
