<p>French shares, drawing support from dollar strength, limped to a higher close. But traders said the market lacked volume to make a convincing advance.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very little interest in the market,&quot; said one broker, who added that the futures pit took much of the action. Another said 2,600 was the top of the trading range on the CAC index, and once that was hit, player would likely take profits.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 6.69 points or 0.26 percent at 2,579. The CAC-40 futures contract was down one at 2,582 from Monday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was a relatively low 5.4 billion francs.  </p>
<p>* Synthelabo reverses earlier weakness, gains 2.68 percent to 613 francs, after giving a bullish briefing to analysts. It said it would receive 49 percent of the profits of its Lorax Pharmaceuticals joint venture with Searle from 2000, compared to the current 10 percent.</p>
<p>Brokers had been disappointed in its EPS growth forecast.</p>
<p>* Havas, rises sharply, up 2.62 percent to 411.5, on speculation Belgian businessman Albert Frere is about to take a 22 percent stake. in the media group. Omnium Plastic, up 4.72 percent to 508 francs, also rose on talk that Frere was buying into the group.  </p>
<p>* Among catch-ups after Monday's rise of more than two percent, were Air Liquide, up 1.65 percent,  and Lagardere, up 1.58 percent.</p>
<p>Air Liquide is not often among leading stocks when the market swings, despite its self-avowed aim of boosting shareholder return and a diverse international shareholder base. One broker said it lacked clear visibility in future margins in its diversification plans.</p>
<p>* Lyonnaise des Eaux, down 0.37 percent to 540, said it would issue a statement after Friday's special board meeting to discuss a merger with Cie de Suez.  </p>
<p>Lyonnaise will also brief analysts on Monday April 14, at 0600 GMT.</p>
<p>Suez was down 0.46 percent at 282.</p>
