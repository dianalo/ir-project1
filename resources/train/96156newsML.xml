<p>The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has vowed to defend areas bordering on Afghanistan if fighting there spills over but leaders agreed at a summit meeting not to interfere in the conflict.</p>
<p>Five leaders of former Soviet republics, alarmed by the rise to power in Kabul of a radical Islamic militia, ended their summit on Friday with an appeal to the rival groups to hold talks and for the United Nations to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;We call upon all warring parties to stop hostilities and resume peace negotiations,&quot; Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev said at a joint news conference.</p>
<p>He also accused the Taleban militia of committing human rights violations after the seizure of the capital Kabul last week, referring to the execution of some of the Taleban's political opponents.</p>
<p>&quot;We denounce the executions and violations of human rights committed in Afghanistan,&quot; Nazarbayev said.</p>
<p>The Taleban's victims included former Moscow-backed Afghan president Najibullah, a communist installed as Afghan leader in 1987 during the 10-year Soviet occupation of the country.</p>
<p>The Almaty summit was attended by the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>It was called to discuss possible steps if the Taleban advanced north to the southern borders of the CIS, a loose 12-member grouping formed as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev said participants at the summit would take &quot;adequate measures&quot; to defend themselves if the conflict spilled over from Afghanistan. But he and other participants made clear that no practical steps would be taken unless this happened.</p>
<p>&quot;We are strongly against interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs,&quot; Nazarbayev said.</p>
<p>However, Uzbek President Islam Karimov said that Afghan warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum was all that stood between the Taleban militia and the former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>Karmimov said that Dostum, who controls a strategic tunnel to northern Afghanistan, deserved stronger support from the neighbouring former Soviet states.</p>
<p>&quot;If this tunnel is surrendered, they will have no obstacle on their way northwards and we don't know how far they may go,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do not want the war to escalate, if we want to force all parties to the negotiating table, we have to make sure that Dostum keeps the tunnel under his control.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no indication that the other leaders at the summit shared Karimov's views. Uzbekistan is one of three former Soviet Central Asian republics that border on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev said he, Chernomyrdin, Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, Uzbekistan's Karimov and Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev wanted the U.N. Security Council to meet on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>He also said the five countries would start supplying northern Afghanistan with humanitarian aid to help the war-stricken civilian population.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said he thought that the future stand of the CIS states would largely depend on further steps by other countries which have an impact on the situation in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;We are watching attentively what other countries are doing, including the United States and Pakistan,&quot; he said. &quot;This, of course, will influence our position.&quot;</p>
