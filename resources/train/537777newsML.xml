<p>The Indonesian rupiah fell against the dollar in early trading on Thursday ahead of the start of the election campaign on Sunday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has turned bullish on the dollar. My customers just ask for a price and take it,&quot; one U.S. bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah fell to 2,425.00/25.75 at 0200 GMT from an opening of 2,420.5/21.5. Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,423.75/24.50 and 2,421.15/22.65, respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said operators were nervous ahead of the April 27 start of the campaign for the May 29 elections and the possibility of possible unrest or riots during the period.  </p>
<p>Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,404/2,596 and the conversion band at 2,404/2,452 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>-- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364  </p>
<p>One Japanese bank dealer said a relatively ample rupiah market helped the dollar buying. Overnight money was traded at 10.0 percent in the morning.</p>
<p>He said the small dollar rally was launched by Singapore operators and some local players followed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's more politics than fundamentals. I haven't heard of any rumours yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But one economist in Singapore said the present weakening of the rupiah was only temporary and the local currency was set to recover after the election as operators would start trading on economic fundamentals again.  </p>
<p>&quot;I prefer to stay square for now. The market is rather volatile,&quot; the U.S. bank dealer said, adding that there were some premiums priced into the spot due to the weekend factor.</p>
<p>He said operators were also nervous because the rupiah's decline had speeded up in the last four days.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 0.30/0.35 and tom/next at 1.1/1.2.</p>
<p>The Japanese bank dealer said swap rates edged up slightly.</p>
<p>He expected them to increase further as the market entered the campaign period next week.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 11.5/12.5, two at 24.25/25.00, three at 35.5/37.0 and six at 72.75/73.50 points.</p>
