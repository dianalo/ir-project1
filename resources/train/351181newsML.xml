<p>Lebanon's military court on Monday sentenced 22 Lebanese men to up to 20 years in prison with hard labour for collaborating with Israel and planning attacks on Syrian forces.</p>
<p>Only four of the convicted were in custody. Kamil al-Rami, a former staff sergeant was sentenced to 10 years hard labour.</p>
<p>Abbas Dabja, who received 20 years, is a local official of the Syrian-backed Amal Movement, which launches guerrilla attacks against Israeli troops in Lebanon and is headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.</p>
<p>The indictment had stated that Abbas visited Israel and gave &quot;detailed information on south Lebanon villages, Amal officials' homes, resistance centres, weapons depots and all those working for the resistance and the internal divisions of the Amal operation room&quot;.</p>
<p>The remaining two were sentenced to seven years in jail.</p>
<p>Fifteen (corrects from Fourteen) absentees were sentenced to 20 years hard labour. Those included Akel Hashem, western region commander of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a 3,000-strong client militia which helps Israel control a border zone in south Lebanon. Two others were sentenced to 10 years.</p>
<p>Keitel al-Hayeh, a former major in the Lebanese army was sentenced to 12 years in jail. Hayek and two others were convicted with planning attacks that included a failed 1988 assassination attempt against Brigadier Ghazi Kenaan, head of the Syrian military intelligence in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Syria has 35,000 troops in the country and is Lebanon's main power broker.</p>
<p>Lebanon and Israel are still officially in a state of war despite over five years of peace talks which are currently stalled.</p>
<p>Under Lebanese laws, suspects convicted in absentia are retried when they surrender or get arrested.</p>
