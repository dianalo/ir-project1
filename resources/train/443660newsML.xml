<p>Louisiana could save up to $1.5 million in interest costs on next week's $225.625 million general obligation bond sale as a result of improved ratings, state Treausurer Ken Duncan said.</p>
<p>The sale is set for March 19 via competitive bid.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service raised Louisiana's GO bond rating to A3 from Baa1 and Fitch Investors Service gave the state's GO bonds a first-time rating of single-A.</p>
<p>Louisiana is still waiting to hear from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp, which cut Louisiana GOs from single-A to A-minus in 1995 and has the A-minus rating on CreditWatch with negative implications.</p>
<p>Duncan said S&amp;P had requested additional information on the state's Medicaid budget &quot;and is therefore taking somewhat longer to reach its rating decision&quot; on the upcoming issue.</p>
<p>It was the first time since 1987 that all three rating agencies have had Louisiana GOs in the single-A category. But Louisiana is still the lowest-rated state in the nation.</p>
<p>&quot;Louisiana's credit outlook is clearly moving in the right direction and the state has made progress in getting its fiscal house in order,&quot; Duncan said in a prepared statement. &quot;We must continue to live within our means, spend the resources we have wisely and put money away for a rainy day.&quot; He said Louisiana also needs to fully resolve chronic shortfalls in its Medicaid budget and make permanent its temporary sales taxes on food and utilities.</p>
