<p>Fourth seed Alex O'Brien overcame a shaky start and an off day at the service line to post a three-set, second-round victory over Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Heavy rain and tornadoes in the area postponed the start of play until the evening. When the weather finally cleared, O'Brien posted a 2-6 6-3 6-2 win over Carlsen to advance.</p>
<p>Sixth-seeded American Chris Woodruff and defending champion Fernando Meligeni of Brazil also moved on.</p>
<p>In a minor upset, South African Grant Stafford ousted eighth seed Sandon Stolle of Australia 6-2 6-3. Stolle is ranked just seven places ahead of the unseeded Stafford at 68th in the world.</p>
<p>Woodruff defeated Germany's Oliver Gross 7-5 7-6 (7-3), while Meligeni beat Martin Rodriguez of Argentina 6-4 6-2.</p>
<p>O'Brien was the highest seed to see action in a weak field with most of the world's top players at the Monte Carlo Open.</p>
<p>The 39th-ranked American got off to a slow start against 84th-ranked Carlsen, dropping his opening service game and falling behind 5-2 when Carlsen broke him again.</p>
<p>Carlsen, a steady groundstroker, served out the first set but fell behind quickly in the second.</p>
<p>O'Brien raced to 5-1 lead before his serve let him down again while serving for the set. With a comfortable lead, however, the American shrugged off the setback and broke Carlsen for the set in the next game with a backhand volley winner to level the match.</p>
<p>O'Brien got the early break in the third set for a 2-1 edge and worked Carlsen's weaker backhand side to build a commanding 5-2 lead.</p>
<p>This time, O'Brien served out the match, converting his third match point on a backhand error by the Dane.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really happy I stayed in there,&quot; said O'Brien, reflecting on his early troubles. &quot;I hung in there well and worked my way out of it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to know if I don't serve well I can back it up with a strong baseline game.&quot;</p>
