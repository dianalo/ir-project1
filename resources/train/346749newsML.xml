<p>----------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* The Canadian dollar ended Friday's trading session firm at C$1.3468 (US$0.7425) from this morning's open of C$1.3491 (US$0.7412) stuck in a narrow range, dealers said.</p>
<p>* They said the currency regained Thursday's closing levels by midday, but trading interest dwindled afterward and the unit did not stray more than three basis points from that level.  </p>
<p>In economic news, Statistics Canada reported Canada's real gross domestic product rose 0.5 percent in November, seasonally adjusted after climbing a revised 0.4 percent (0.3 percent) in October. A Reuters survey of economists had forecast real GDP to rise 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said the rise in GDP was a sign that Canada's economy was beginning to feel the effects of interest rate cuts over the past two years. But some warned that stronger- than-expected U.S. economic growth could mean a rise in U.S. interest rates in the near future. Such a rise would put pressure on the Canadian dollar as Canada/U.S. spreads widen.  </p>
<p>U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 4.7 percent after an increase of 2.1 percent in the final estimate of the third quarter, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourth-quarter growth was far more than anybody was looking for and it is something that's going to keep the (Federal Reserve) on notice that growth is eclipsing their expectations by a visible amount.</p>
<p>On the crosses, Canada's dollar edged higher to 1.2158 marks from Thursday'd close of 1.2141 marks and fell to 90.04 yen from 90.42 yen.</p>
