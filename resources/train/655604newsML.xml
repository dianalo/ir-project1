<p>Injured double Olympic champion Michael Johnson may get a second chance to compete in the world athletics championships this summer.</p>
<p>The executive committee of USA Track and Field will consider Thursday asking the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) for wild-card positions for Johnson and other injured American stars in the August world championships in Athens.</p>
<p>Under current U.S. qualifying rules, only athletes who finish in the top three at the U.S. championships are eligible for the American team for the world championships.</p>
<p>But IAAF officials, faced with the loss of Johnson and U.S. stars Dan O'Brien, Mike Powell and Gwen Torrence at the world championships, have indicated they are willing to consider &quot;wild card&quot; entries for defending world champions. That would include Johnson, O'Brien and Torrence.</p>
<p>Johnson, recovering from severely pulled left quadriceps suffered in his 150-meter showdown with 100-meter world record-holder Donovan Bailey, said Wednesday in Dallas he would consider such an invitation.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to lobby for it,&quot; said the 200-meter world record holder. &quot;I don't think it is something I should do. If they ask me to compete, I'll consider it.&quot;</p>
<p>Johnson said he was &quot;coming around slowly&quot; from his injury. &quot;There is still some swelling,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he had been working out on an exercise bike since Monday and hoped to be back on the track training by next Monday.</p>
<p>He is still hopeful of making his first European appearance this season in a 400 meters in Paris on June 25.</p>
