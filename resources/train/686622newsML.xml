<p>Indian police on Wednesday detained five leaders of Kashmir's main separatist group, the All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, and a dozen supporters, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>Police said the Hurriyat members, among them Hurriyat chairman Omar Farooq, were released after three hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody has been released, nobody is in our custody,&quot; a senior Srinagar police official, Sandeep Nayak, told a news conference.</p>
<p>The separatists were held after Farooq told a news conference the group planned to hold a rally on Friday to mobilise support for the seven-year-old separatist movement.</p>
<p>Since 1990, more than a dozen guerrilla groups in Kashmir have been fighting for an independent homeland or merger with neighbouring Pakistan. Police and hospital officials say more than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence.</p>
<p>Public gatherings of more than four people are not allowed in many parts of Kashmir. Nayak said the government had not received a request from the Hurriyat to hold the rally.</p>
<p>The Hurriyat is an umbrella organisation that bands nearly 30 leading political and religious groups in Kashmir.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police raided the organisation's office in the Rajbagh neighbourhood of Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir. They arrested Farooq and four other leaders including Abdul Gani Lone, Yasin Malik and Ali Shah Geelani.</p>
<p>People in downtown Srinagar threw stones at policemen in protest against the detentions. No casualties were reported.</p>
<p>The Hurriyat on Tuesday said it welcomed talks between India and Pakistan over divided Kashmir, but urged the two nations to include Kashmiri representatives.</p>
<p>The two nations have fought two wars over the region since 1947. India controls two-thirds of the area and Pakistan the rest.</p>
