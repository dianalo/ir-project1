<headline>Imo ends deal with United Dominion.</headline>
<dateline>LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J.</dateline>

<p>Pump maker Imo Industries Inc. said late Friday it terminated its merger agreement with United Dominion Industries Ltd. to accept a better offer from an affiliate of Constellation Capital Partners LLC.</p>
<p>While United Dominion had offered $6 a share, worth about $440 million, Imo said it now has a definitive agreement with II Acquisition Corp. for $7.05 a share, net in cash.</p>
<p>II Acquisition will begin a tender offer for all of Imo's common stock on or before Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Constellation is a private equity firm based in Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>&quot;Acquisition Corp.'s offer...exceeds United Dominion's offer by more than 17 percent and does not include any financing condition,&quot; Imo Chairman and Chief Executive Donald Farrar said in a statement. &quot;Imo's Board of Directors believes Acquisition Corp.'s offer will provide Imo's stockholders better value than United Dominion's offer.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Imo's board of directors unanimously determined that the II Acquisition Corp. offer was on terms more favourable to its stockholders, Imo said.</p>
<p>United Dominion officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Imo said it will pay United Dominion $8 million for calling off the merger and up to another $2 million for expenses incurred.</p>
<p>Unlike the United Dominion agreement, the II Acquisition agreement does not include an offer to buy Imo bonds.</p>
<p>II Acquisition's tender offer for the shares of Imo common stock is subject to the receipt of more than 80 percent of Imo's outstanding shares, it said. Any shares not purchased in the tender offer will remain outstanding.</p>
<p>Imo is a diversified manufacturer of pumps, fluid sensors, motion control products, remote control systems, and automobile components.</p>
<p>Imo's stock closed unchanged at $5.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. United Dominion rose 90 cents Canadian to C$38.80 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
