<p>The International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) said on Thursday it is looking at ways to increase the liquidity of its newly-launched natural gas contract, including changes to the contract specification and margins.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot assume that all the parameters of the contract are set in concrete,&quot; said Richard Ward, the IPE's business development director at the official launch of the contract.</p>
<p>Ward said that the IPE was planning to host a working group with key market players in three weeks to discuss issues of liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;If there was consensus there would be no trouble at all in changing the parameters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A promising 465 lots changed hands on the first day of trade on January 31, but volumes have since dropped off to average 235 lots, with a low on February 11 of just 35.</p>
<p>Traders have suggested removing the minimum trade threshold of five lots of 1,000 therms per day in order to encourage smaller end-users into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd give access to a lot more people if you could trade in single lots,&quot; said one IPE broker.</p>
<p>Reducing margins, which are set not by the IPE but by the London Clearing House, was also seen as a way of attracting more players to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity begets liquidity and the current level of margins are too high...We need to make a strong case to reduce margins to encourage more players in,&quot; said Jake Ulrich, managing director of British Gas trading arm Accord.</p>
<p>The new contract is based at the National Balancing Point (NBP), a notional trading point within the TransCo system.</p>
<p>But the IPE said that it has not dropped its original plans for a contract based at the beach terminal Bacton.</p>
<p>The main stumbling block has been the failure of the Claims Validation Agent (CVA) to come up with an effective mechanism for the verification of physical deliveries of gas at the beach.</p>
<p>Director general of gas supply at regulator Ofgas Claire Spottiswoode described the CVA problems as a &quot;recurring bad dream&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When the CVA issue is resolved we should be able to launch a beach contract,&quot; said the IPE's Ward.</p>
