<p>&quot;Chairman of Iraq's National Olympic Committee Uday Saddam Hussein received a delegation...from the United Arab Emirates who arrived in the country upon directives from (UAE) Crown Prince and Defence Minister Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid al- Maktoum,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>&quot;The delegation expressed happiness over the recovery of Mr Uday Saddam Hussein and his safety from the criminal attempt on his life,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Uday was wounded by unidentified gunmen on December 12 as he was driving in Baghdad's wealthy district of al-Mansour.</p>
<p>He was also shown by his television channel, Shabab, on Monday night lying in a Baghdad hospital, his body covered with a sheet, kissing and shaking hands with the visitors.</p>
<p>The UAE group arrived on Monday with 32 tonnes of baby milk and medicine to help ease the suffering of Iraqi children under U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.</p>
