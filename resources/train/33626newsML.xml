<p>The Bank of Finland's tender rate, its main monetary policy tool, is expected to remain unchanged or fall slightly in the next three months from the current 3.25 percent, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>Of 22 dealers, analysts and economists at banks and corporate treasury departments, 13 expected the tender rate to remain unchanged while nine expected it to be cut further.</p>
<p>Six of the nine expecting a fall were banks. Three saw the tender rate falling to 3.00 percent by December.</p>
<p>The mean of all forecasts was 3.18 percent with the lowest at 3.00 percent. None of those polled expected the tender rate to be raised in the next three months.</p>
<p>Looking one year ahead, views were mixed about the direction of monetary policy. Tender rate forecasts were in a range of 2.75-4.50 percent with the mean at 3.64 percent.</p>
<p>Nineteen of 22 expected the tender rate to rise, five of them saw it at 4.00 percent or above.</p>
<p>One saw it stable at 3.25 percent and two expected it to be lower.</p>
<p>In the previous poll conducted early June, the mean of forecasts looking three months ahead was 3.61 percent. The range was 3.25-3.75 percent. At that time, the tender rate stood at 3.75 percent.</p>
<p>The new quarterly poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday this week. Forecasts were collected on an anonymous basis. @</p>
