<text>
<p>Spurred on by Europe, three of North Africa's developing economies are making revolutionary changes to transform their industry, trading traditions and financial and legal frameworks.</p>
<p>Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia face the triple challenge of an increasingly global marketplace, the growing competition from Eastern Europe and Asia for investment and expertise, and the need to provide work for a surge of young jobless.</p>
<p>Trade with the European Union is one of the most pressing reasons for change.</p>
<p>The EU is already the chief trading partner for the 65 million people of the three Maghreb countries, but the relationship will grow closer.</p>
<p>Rabat and Tunis have signed association accords with the EU for a free trade zone by the year 2010. But that excludes agriculture -- a sore point for Moroccan farmers competing with Spain, Portugal and Greece.</p>
<p>Algeria has started negotiations on the same track. And all three countries speak of reform and the challenge of change.</p>
<p>THE CHALLENGE OF REFORM</p>
<p>&quot;For us, the fast development of our capital markets is, before every other aim, crucial to helping Moroccan companies compete in the new free trade zone Morocco is building,&quot; Andre Azoulay, economic adviser to Moroccan King Hassan, says.</p>
<p>Morocco has already reformed banking and trade and customs laws. It has privatised the company running its stock exchange, set up a securities exchange commission, and laid down the regulatory framework for the mutual fund industry. There are no limits on foreign investment or repatriation of funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has certainly created a welcoming environment for investors on the macroeconomic and legal level,&quot; David Pollock, a consultant with London-based GMA Capital Markets said recently.</p>
<p>But, like other analysts, he said this top-level reform needed to filter down to produce efficiency &quot;at the level of administrative procedures&quot;.</p>
<p>There is also wide criticism of Morocco's education system, with 60 percent illiteracy, and foreign analysts say reform here remains a key factor for economic growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>LOWER TARIFFS</p>
<p>Tunisia, the first Arab country to sign with the EU, is dismantling customs tariffs and has an upgrading programme to modernise about 200 firms each year for the next 10 years.</p>
<p>There too, analysts say, the will for change exists at the top but has yet to spread to those carrying out the paperwork.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had lots of cases where people were enthusiastic at the start but lost this when they ran into bureaucracy and inefficiency,&quot; one Tunis-based European economic specialist told Reuters earlier this year.</p>
<p>Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, speaking of the free trade objective after talks with the EU this month, said: &quot;As a counterpart we expect Europe to take part in the rehabilitation of our industrial structure.&quot;</p>
<p>All three countries are pushing ahead with privatisation programmes for state companies which they hope will attract investors and expertise.</p>
<p>A new Moroccan privatisation law is under debate which could speed up and extend a programme which since 1993 has produced revenues of some $1.1 billion, with more than 20 percent coming from foreign investors.</p>
<p>MORE PRIVATISATION</p>
<p>Another law could open the telecommunications sector to outside investment. Concessions, such as the one granted to a French firm to provide Casablanca's power and water, are seen as another lure.</p>
<p>Tunisia this month changed a law to allow foreigners to buy up to 49 percent of listed firms without prior authorisation, compared with a 10 percent limit previously.</p>
<p>Algeria, its economy driven by oil and gas exports, is now seeking to gear up its non-energy industry to earn at least $2 billion a year by 2000.</p>
<p>It wants foreign input. And under its latest privatisation law passed this month, about 250 firms should go under the hammer, with the government hoping they will appeal to foreign buyers.</p>
<p>Economic analysts see no foreign rush to Algiers. Conflict between Moslem fundamentalists and government forces has killed about 60,000, including more than 100 foreigners, and the conflict has deterred investors, apart from those investing in oil and gas.</p>
<p>ALGERIA OPENS UP</p>
<p>Algeria opened oil and gas fields to foreign direct investment in 1990 and has signed about 40 contracts.</p>
<p>Officials believe foreign investment can spread to other sectors, despite the problems of restructuring inefficient state firms. Foreign cash could be attracted by tax incentives and the scrapping of rules guaranteeing job security in overstaffed companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The new law should bring a greater spirit of free enterprise...,&quot; one Algiers-based analyst said this month.</p>
<p>Direct foreign investment last year fell in both Tunisia and Morocco over the previous year. But this month, the South Korean firm Daewoo Corp said it was to invest $900 million in Morocco, and a Tunisian minister said an earlier energy investment programme gave a misleading impression of subsequent falling investment.</p>
<p>&quot;The accord with the European Union has already started boosting foreign investment,&quot; Mohamed Ghannouchi, International Cooperation and Foreign Investment Minister, said.</p>
<p>The emphasis on Europe underscores trading realities, despite hopes pinned on the five-nation Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) when it was formed in 1989 as a trading bloc between the three countries, Mauritania and Libya.</p>
<p>More than 70 percent of Tunisia's and Algeria's trade, and over 50 percent of Morocco's, is with the EU. Latest overall figures for the AMU, for 1994, show inter-Maghreb trade totalled $872.9 million, just 3.38 percent of total trade.</p>
