<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reporters:</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make unequivocally clear -- the agreement that we have spoken about in recent months is an essential need in order to prevent violent acts from both sides of the sort we saw today. I say a lot of the time that the delays in the negotiations only create a situation of instability, uncertainty, and they provoke and create conditions for developments of the sort we have seen today and so we must complete this agreement in the good and responsible way that we said we would. And I want to say again in a sharp way that no crime and no violent act will stand in the way of our completing the work.&quot;</p>

<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to reporters:</p>
<p>&quot;This is a regrettable act and we are following the details.&quot;</p>

<p>U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross to reporters:</p>
<p>&quot;We in the United States condemn this act on the strongest possible terms...Those who use violence cannot and must not and will not be arbiters of the future...We will continue to find ways to overcome the differences.&quot;</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>White House spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn to reporters travelling with President Bill Clinton on a vacation trip:</p>
<p>&quot;We are shocked and saddened by what happened and it just underscores the need to bring about a peace agreement as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen to Reuters: &quot;It's a declared plan from the settlers against peace. Religious settlers are natural killers and if settlements remain it will endanger any chance of peace.&quot;</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>PLO negotiator Hassan Asfour to Reuters:</p>
<p>&quot;We demand more protection for Palestinians in Hebron and Netanyahu has to show responsibility by being a real partner in the peace process. Netanyahu has to ban all extremist Jewish organisations. It's very unfortunate that new massacres are now being committed not only from the extremist Jews but also from the official organisations within the ruling Israeli coalition.&quot;</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to Reuters:</p>
<p>&quot;There is no peace with settlers living amidst Palestinians. Palestinians demand protection for the Palestinian people in Hebron instead of having Israel demand more security for killers in Hebron.&quot;</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>Dore Gold, political adviser to Netanyahu, to CNN:</p>
<p>&quot;He (Netanyahu) was thoroughly horrified and shocked and immediately wished to speak to Mr Arafat and express his bitter feelings about this event and of course extend sympathy to the families of those who were wounded...He is determined to see the peace process will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>- - - - -</p>
<p>Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in a leaflet:</p>
<p>&quot;We in Hamas see that the new Zionist crime is another reiteration that the hollow agreements will not end the conflict with the Zionists...The continued presence of settlers in the heart of the brave Hebron city will continue to be a time bomb and nobody knows when it will explode to shed more of our peoples' blood in the city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We in Hamas assure our people and the whole world that the crimes of the Zionists will not pass without a price, this will come sooner or later, and that comprehensive resistance will continue until occupation ends, and we announce again that the (Arafat's Palestinian) Authority's agreements don't bind our people and the movement will continue defending our people and our cause.&quot;</p>
