<p>The last two days before an execution is a time of frantic legal activity, but for the condemned man there is little to do but sit and wait.</p>
<p>Convicted murderer Coleman Wayne Gray is scheduled for execution by lethal injection in Virginia's Greensville Correctional Centre Wednesday at 9 P.M. sharp.</p>
<p>Gray was convicted of the May 1985 murder of grocery store manager Richard McClelland. His case has wound its way through the legal system for more than 11 years with countless hearings and appeals to state and federal courts.</p>
<p>But his lawyer Donald Lee, who has filed two petitions to the U.S. Supreme Court and has asked Virginia Gov. George Allen for clemency, says he is running out of options.</p>
<p>&quot;We are probably near the end of our resources,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>An all-white jury convicted Gray, who is black, of robbing and abducting McClelland, a white, and shooting him six times in the back of the head despite his pleas for mercy. He was found guilty largely on the testimony of his accomplice Melvin Tucker, but Gray insists that Tucker was the trigger man.</p>
<p>Tucker also testified in the penalty phase of Gray's trial that he bragged of having committed two other murders -- the 1984 killings of Lisa Sorrell and her three-year-old daughter Shanta -- in much the same way he allegedly killed McClelland.</p>
<p>The prosecutor had promised the defence it would not bring in additional evidence about the Sorrell murders but he went back on his word and introduced gruesome forensic evidence about the case, which the defence was unprepared to rebut.</p>
<p>The defence lawyers did not know, so the jury never heard, that there was another strong suspect in the Sorrell case. In fact, Gray was never charged with the Sorrell murders.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't find relief and we're unable to save our client it will really shake my faith in the system because Coleman Gray's trial was a travesty,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee has been involved in 18 death penalty cases, all but two of which ended in execution. He said the pressure was beginning to get to him.</p>
<p>Last year, Virginia led the nation in executions with eight. Since November, the state has been putting criminals to death at a rate of around one every two weeks.</p>
<p>Critics say the system penalises the poor, especially blacks accused of killing whites.</p>
<p>The American Bar Association recently called for executions to be suspended, calling the system &quot;a haphazard maze of unfair practices with no internal consistency&quot; and condemning what it said were &quot;longstanding patterns of racial discrimination in courts across the country.&quot;</p>
<p>The ABA said the main factor determining who was executed and who was not was the quality of legal representation defendants received at their initial trials.</p>
<p>The first time Gray's case reached the Supreme Court in 1995, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that he had been denied his fundamental right to due process and said the prosecutor's behaviour had &quot;fatally infected&quot; his case for the death penalty. But the court, by a five to four majority, ruled against Gray.</p>
<p>In an affidavit filed last week to the Court of Appeals in Richmond, Tucker recanted his testimony about the earlier Sorrell killings, saying he was forced to perjure himself by the prosecution to avoid the death penalty. But he still maintains Gray killed McClelland.</p>
<p>&quot;My testimony concerning Coleman Gray telling me that he killed the Sorrell woman and child was a lie,&quot; Tucker said in his affidavit. But the Richmond court rejected the petition.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with Reuters from his prison cell on death row on Thursday, Gray insisted that he was not the murderer and said he was the victim of false testimony.</p>
<p>&quot;I try not to think about dying but sometimes it's hard,&quot; he said. &quot;I can only hope and continue to pray things will work out for me.&quot;</p>
