<p>U.S. sweet crude grade differentials gained strength Thursday morning, shaving discounts to a firming outright cash price.</p>
<p>July West Texas Intermediate/Cushing was around 15 cents higher at $18.85-95 a barrel, compared to the futures screen price at $18.70 a barrel, 15 cents higher from Wednesday.</p>
<p>July EFPs were trading around 16-19 cents premium.</p>
<p>Sweet grades were led higher by Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James, which sold as firm as an 11 cents discount to the July WTI/Cushing cash, nine cents stronger than Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say it's short covering in LLS by foreign crude guys hedging against unsold foreign crude cargoes,&quot; said a cash player in Texas.</p>
<p>Refiners were not seen as being particularly active in the buy-up, the trader said.</p>
<p>Overall, July barrels look to be attracting more interest from buyers than in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Margins are real good in the Med, and okay for northwest Europe, so there's been a general cleaning-up of some barrels. But, there are no shortages for August barrels,&quot; said a cash player.</p>
<p>Other trades were seen for Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire at 55 and 52 cents under WTI/Cushing, and for July Postings Plus at $1.80 and $1.83.</p>
