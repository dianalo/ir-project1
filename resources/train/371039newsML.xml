<p>South Korea's Finance and Economy Minister Han Seung-soo on Tuesday urged the nation's banks and other financial institutions to improve financial systems and practices in the wake of Hanbo Steel Co's collapse.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said Han also called on chiefs of the nation's major financial institutions to cooperate with government efforts to ease financial instability caused by the steelmaker's failure.  </p>
<p>Han presided over a meeting of banking and financial institution representatives to discuss countersteps against financial instability, the statement said.</p>
<p>He also said his ministry would work to improve financial practices to eliminate problems in the local financial industry highlighted by Hanbo's insolvency.</p>
<p>But he did not detail what steps would be taken.</p>
<p>Hanbo, flagship unit of the nation's 14th largest conglomerate Hanbo Group, was declared insolvent on January 23 after accumulating some five trillion won in loans.  </p>
<p>State prosecutors have been investigating how such a huge amount of loans had been funnelled into the steelmaker, which poured the money into building a new steel mill.</p>
<p>The prosecution has arrested Hanbo Group founder Chung Tae-soo and chiefs of Korea First Bank and Cho Hung Bank for bribery charges.</p>
<p>Two lawmakers from the ruling New Korea Party and the main opposition National Congress for New Politics have also been questioned by prosecutors on allegations that they had accepted bribes from Chung in return for helping the steelmaker receive loans. -- Seoul Newsroom (822) 727-5646</p>
