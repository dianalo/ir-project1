<p>Australian bond futures contracts were put under further pressure in after hours trading as the U.S. Treasury market fell for the fourth consecutive session.</p>
<p>The September 10-year bond contract ended SYCOM at 92.835, down from a pit close of 92.875 and breaking the previous corrective low 92.845 seen last week.</p>
<p>Analysts see support at 92.810 and then at the psychological level of 92.750 before the market retraces to the rising trendline at 92.680 which started running from early April.</p>
<p>Resistance is pegged at 92.880, but the contract needs to get back over 92.930 to re-install the rally.  </p>
<p>Extreme bullish confidence over the prospect of a monetary policy easing by the Reserve Bank next week has been watered down in the past few sessions, notably in bill futures where the September contract is only pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut rather than nearer 50 basis points at the start of the week.</p>
<p>The local market was dragged down further as U.S. Treasuries succumbed to profit-taking, triggered by a 14,000 decline in the weekly jobless claims.</p>
<p>The data combined with strong consumer confidence and homes sales data this week has dented thoughts of the economy slowing and the Federal Reserve being on hold for the time being.  </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee meeting meets on July 1/2.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the dollar bloc, the Bank of Canada surprised the market by raising its key bank rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent to support the Canadian dollar, its first rate hike since February 1995.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the RBNZ endorsed a 100 basis point easing in its Monetary Policy Statement from the projections made in March, a slightly larger than expected move than the market had been expecting.</p>
