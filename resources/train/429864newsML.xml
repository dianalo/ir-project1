<headline>GDR REPORT - India GDRs languish after Hindu holiday.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-10</dateline>

<p>Indian global depository receipts (GDRs) ended a slow trading session easier in line with domestic market weakness following Friday's Hindu festival holiday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;GDRs were basically easier reflecting the local market weakness,&quot; said one trader, noting that the budget-inspired rally had come to an end for the time being.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still optimistic but they're looking for a pull back in an overbought market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Another trader said particular GDRs like ICICI and Hindalco held up quite well during the session, but others including ITC, Mahindra, Indian Hotels, and IPCL were all hit back.</p>
<p>The weakness looks set to continue, at least in the short term, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting more volatility and further weakness tomorrow, but we're hoping for a technical rally at some point,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>The HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index closed down 3.39 percent, or 2.59 points at 73.80, with the premium over the local market at 13.87 percent compared with Friday's 11.74.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index tumbled 2.8 percent to 3,768.74.</p>
<p>Taiwanese stocks on Monday ended a five-day rally that took the local index to record highs. They finished softer after a day of profit-taking, but GDR strength persisted.</p>
<p>The Capel Taiwan GDR Index climbed 0.12 percent or 0.13 points to 109.55 with a premium over the local market of 0.74 percent.</p>
<p>Korean stocks ended 7.72 points lower at a provisional 667.35, and GDRs eased with them.</p>
<p>The Capel Korea GDR Index ended 1.03 points, or 1.73 percent lower at 58.30. The premium over the local market was 43.69 percent.</p>
