<p>Israeli shares closed mixed with a negative bias in dull trading on Tuesday in what traders said was a technical correction.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 0.20 points, or 0.11 percent, to 189.99 on an all-share turnover of 71 million shekels against 101.5 million on Monday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 index lost 0.23 percent to 199.11.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was very quiet today. During the last two weeks the market gained more than 10 percent. It is difficult to say if today's decline was only an outcome of profit taking and if the positive trend will continue in the coming days,&quot; said Ronen Kaufman at Y.L.R Capital Markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The mood in the market is good but investors are cautious, waiting to see what will happen. After two stormy weeks the market needs to calm down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The session opened with a positive trend and the market rose by almost 0.5 percent but by midday the market lost its momentum and started falling,&quot; said a trader at the First International Bank of Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall trading was dull today with no special activity. A technical correction had to come after two weeks. We might see some profit taking in the next few days but the market will remain stuck at the current level,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The main gainer on the Maof was Tadiran, which rose 3.25 percent to 1,362 after its share traded in New York rose 2.9 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Bank Hapoalim, which gained 1.25 percent to 460 on volume of 4.3 million shekels; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which fell 0.5 percent to 117,882 on turnover of 3.8 million shekels; and Super Sol, which closed unchanged at 7,274 on volume of 3.6 million shekels.</p>
