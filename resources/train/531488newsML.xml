<p>Armed robbers on Wednesday doused seven bank staff with petrol and threatened to set them on fire before escaping with a substantial amount of cash, South African police said.</p>
<p>The robbery in the trendy Johannesburg suburb of Melville started before opening time when a man wearing a shirt and tie resembling bank-issued clothing was let into the bank by employees who thought he was a colleague.</p>
<p>&quot;The suspect walked to a counter, producted a pistol and announced that he was from the 'Bank Robbers' Association',&quot; police inspector Mark Reynolds said in a statement.</p>
<p>The gunman let two accomplices in and the trio doused staff with petrol to dissuade them from calling police and forced them to open the safe.</p>
<p>Reynolds said the robbers fled with &quot;substantial&quot; cash but declined to give the value. The staff were locked in the safe.</p>
<p>South Africa's crime wave, which has helped scare off tourists and foreign investors, has eased since 1995 but remains high. Figures show 1.8 million crimes were reported last year.</p>
