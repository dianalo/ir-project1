<p>Israel braced on Monday for more suicide bombings and rapped Palestinian President Yasser Arafat for trotting the globe while peace moves are mired in crisis.</p>
<p>Israeli leaders stopped short of suspending talks with the PLO over an Islamist suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday that killed three Israeli women but demanded Arafat crack down on Moslem militants.</p>
<p>&quot;Arafat must understand that the problems won't be solved in international arenas. He must be here to decide which path he takes,&quot; Levy told Israel Radio as Arafat arrived in Sri Lanka on the fourth day of a nine-day tour.</p>
<p>Arafat was on Sunday in Islamabad where a one-day summit of the 54-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference condemned &quot;Israel's persistence in its settlement expansionist policies&quot; in Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories.</p>
<p>He visited Egypt and Oman before Pakistan and was due to travel to South Africa and Morocco before returning home.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, elected last May promising more security for Israelis, has blamed Arafat for giving Islamic militants the &quot;green light&quot; to launch attacks against the Jewish state. Arafat has denied it.</p>
<p>Friday's bombing further marred Israel-PLO ties already strained over construction Israel launched last week for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu's settlement building was spurring militants and killing peace.</p>
<p>&quot;I think if there is one person who would look in the mirror tonight and see the blood...if Mr Netanyahu would look in the mirror, he will see the real responsibility,&quot; Erekat told CNN television on Sunday.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Palestinian Culture Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo would meet on Monday in an effort to ease the tension. Spokesmen for the president were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Thousands of Israeli troops deployed along the border between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza and manned roadblocks on major highways to prevent would-be bombers reaching their destinations.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate that as long as Arafat does not cause the terrorist organisations to understand that there is no green light to commit attacks, we are expecting more attacks,&quot; said Israel's military intelligence chief, Moshe Yaalon.</p>
<p>He told reporters on Sunday that Arafat's own Fatah group and top PLO security officials had instigated clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank to protest against the settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim, called Har Homa by Israel.</p>
<p>Israel expects Arafat to round up hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists and crack down on the groups as he did after suicide bombers killed 59 people in four attacks a year ago.</p>
<p>A Palestinian official said on Sunday there were no orders for mass arrests.</p>
<p>&quot;The security coordination is linked to the development of the political peace process and they are not separate,&quot; said Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, general secretary of Arafat's Palestinian Authority, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Referring to the man who heads Israel's client South Lebanon Army militia in Israel's Lebanon occupation zone, Abdel-Rahman added:</p>
<p>&quot;They are wrong if they think that the Palestinian Authority is a copy of Antoine Lahd's forces in south Lebanon.&quot;</p>
