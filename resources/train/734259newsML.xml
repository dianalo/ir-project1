<title>JAPAN: Tokyo naphtha bounces back on bullish crude oil.</title>

<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tokyo naphtha prices bounced back on Wednesday, supported by an overnight crude rally as well as bullish sentiment in the regional market fuelled by Thailand's recent buying of prompt cargoes, traders said.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices on the Tokyo market edged down on Tuesday, ending a five-day bull run.</p>
<p>Bids for second-half September open-spec naphtha were heard at $208.50 per tonne, against offers of $209.50 in afternoon dealings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It was traded at $205.00 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, and at $206.50 and $207.00 later on in the day.  </p>
<p>In physical naphtha trading, a major oil refiner in Japan bought one east Asian cargo at somewhere between the mean of Japanese quotes flat and plus $1.00 per tonne for early September delivery on Tuesday, a trader with the refiner said.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever near-term cargoes show signs of a bull run, end-users try to secure at least one cargo at an early stage just to be safe,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like a reflex for us.&quot;</p>
<p>After having remained in contango in three months, naphtha's near-term spreads moved back into backwardation last week, following the purchase of several prompt cargoes by a petrochemical firm in Thailand. --Tokyo Energy Desk</p>
