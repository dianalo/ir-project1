<p>British government bonds, left behind in recent euphoria about a narrowing of interest rate spreads in Europe, are looking to the opposition Labour Party conference this week for a boost, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>But with a general election looming and a threat that the ruling Conservatives might loosen the fiscal reins before then, any short-term gains are likely to be moderate.</p>
<p>&quot;It's ironic that the opposition party's conference can help the spread far more than that of the Conservatives,&quot; said Don Smith, international economist at HSBC Markets in London.</p>
<p>The Labour Party opened its annual conference on Monday in the northern town of Blackpool, the last such party gathering before the Conservatives call a general election by May 1997.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll for the Daily Telegraph newspaper suggested that Labour still holds a lead of 27 points on the Conservatives, despite slipping six points over this month.</p>
<p>Smith said the spread, or difference, between yields on 10-year British gilts and those of comparable German Bunds would move back below 170 basis points -- 1.70 percentage point -- if Labour presents a pro-European stance this week. It is currently around 174 basis points.</p>
<p>Analysts said there was a perception in markets, particularly among continental European investors, that Labour was more likely to take Britain into European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) than the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Recent EMU optimism sent the Italian bond/Bund spread plunging below 240 basis points last Friday, compared with more than 310 basis points at the beginning of September. Spain's spread also slimmed to around 175 points from 250.</p>
<p>Kevin Adams, gilts analyst at BZW in London, said overseas investors wanted to hold gilts and were eager to jump on any signs that Britain's entry into EMU was likely.</p>
<p>&quot;I am detecting a lot of pent-up enthusiasm for gilts,&quot; he said. &quot;The question is how far the spread can come in without an explicit Labour commitment to EMU.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith said it was too much to expect Labour to make such a statement but markets would use the strength of pro-European rhetoric to gauge the likelihood of sterling's entry into EMU if Labour were to win the next election.</p>
<p>&quot;The only issue for the markets is EMU at the moment,&quot; he said. &quot;Investors feel a Conservative government means no EMU.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said there were also worries that the government might sacrifice monetary and fiscal prudence in order to woo the electorate and boost the chances of winning the election.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some analysts said there was a threat that this week's conference might put the spotlight on anti-European elements within the Labour Party.</p>
<p>&quot;There are Euro-sceptics in the Labour Party, too,&quot; said Brian Venables, senior bond analyst at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett in Amsterdam. &quot;The spread is going to be stuck before the election. It's just too risky for overseas investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Venables said investors should stay underweight in gilts and saw the spread ending the year at around 200 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.K. has dug a big hole for itself in Europe and some people are finding it difficult to have any faith in British politics,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Venables said any spread narrowing could only be seen as significant if the 160 basis point level was breached.</p>
<p>Analysts said the fundamentals of the British economy were attractive to bond investors but politics was standing in the way of gilt market gains.</p>
<p>&quot;If a general election were called tomorrow, the spread would narrow by 25 basis points immediately,&quot; said Adams. &quot;It's the Conservative Party that's the problem for the gilt market.&quot;</p>
