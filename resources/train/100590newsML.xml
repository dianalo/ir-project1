<title>UK: Russia gets high speculative grade credit ratings.</title>
<headline>Russia gets high speculative grade credit ratings.</headline>

<text>
<p>Russia's foreign currency debt received high speculative grade ratings on Monday but major credit agencies sounded alarm bells about the country's leadership and legal systems and short economic track record.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service said it assigned a Ba2 sovereign ceiling for ratings on long-term foreign currency bonds and notes of issuers domiciled in Russia.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's assigned a BB minus long-term rating and IBCA, the European rating agency, rated it BB plus long-term.</p>
<p>The ratings from all three agencies fell below the &quot;investment grade&quot; threshold, although Russia has received a more favourable rating than Brazil, one of the world's largest emerging market economies. Moody's rates Brazil B1.</p>
<p>The ratings have been long awaited in international markets as Russia prepared to issue its first Eurobond. The news pushed prices of Russian &quot;MinFin&quot; bonds sharply higher as even lower ratings had been expected.</p>
<p>The Moody's rating pegs Russia as a credit risk of similar standing to countries such as Mexico, Venezuela and the Philippines, and puts it below neighbour the Czech republic, which has an investment grade rating of Baa1.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian political uncertainties have hampered economic performance and slowed the transition to a more efficient market economy,&quot; Moody's said.</p>
<p>It said that if the current president and government were replaced in a future election, all likely successors would be more expansionary and nationalistic in their economic approach.</p>
<p>S&amp;P also said, &quot;President Yeltsin's current illness highlights the risk that changes at the top may, at least for a time, halt the reform process and undermine the authorities' ability to pursue prudent and consistent economic policies.&quot;</p>
<p>But both agencies said there was support in Russia for some of the results of economic reform.</p>
<p>&quot;During the past two years, tight fiscal and monetary policies have yielded progressively better results on inflation, monetary growth, and the consolidated budget deficit,&quot; Moody's said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said strong international backing for Russia's transformation to a market-based economy should continue in the medium term.</p>
<p>S&amp;P, which also said the outlook on the long-term rating was stable, said other key constraining factors were:</p>
<p>-- the government's short economic management track record and, especially, the political and administrative difficulties it faces raising tax revenues,</p>
<p>-- a weak legal system, including lax enforcement that continues to foster widespread corruption, discourages foreign investment, and acts as a drag on overall economic activity.</p>
<p>IBCA said that on the plus side, the rating was underpinned by strong growth in export receipts from oil and gas, which had continued throughout the transition slump.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia also benefits from relatively low external debt ratios despite the decision to assume all the external debt of the former Soviet Union,&quot; IBCA said.</p>
<p>Russia received short-term ratings of Not Prime from Moody's and B from S&amp;P and IBCA.</p>
