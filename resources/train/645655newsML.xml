<p>Lesotho's Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle and several senior cabinet members formed a new breakaway political movement at the weekend, ending months of tensions over leadership within the Basotholand Congress Party.</p>
<p>Mokhehle was on Saturday unanimously voted leader of the new Lesotho Congress for Democracy Party by about 1,000 people in the capital Maseru.</p>
<p>Mokhehle was ousted as leader of the Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) earlier this year at a conference called by a rival faction within the party after accusations the tiny kingdom was drifting into lawlessness.</p>
<p>A Lesotho High Court judge however later reinstated the besieged premier and ordered the BCP to call another meeting to elect a new leader, scheduled for July.</p>
<p>On Friday, BCP executive members, hearing of plans by Mokhehle to call a meeting on Saturday, said he was trying to remove them from office.</p>
<p>But in a surprise move Mokhehle, backed by several senior government officials including Foreign Minister Kelebone Maope, Law and Constitutional Affairs Minister Sephiri Motanyane and Information Minister Monyane Moleleki, announced a new party.</p>
<p>The new movement's flag retains the colours of the BCP -- black, green and red -- but in reverse, with an insignia of a black eagle across the flag. Mokhehle's first name in the Sotho language means &quot;eagle&quot;.</p>
<p>Radio Lesotho said the premier will address a news conference on Monday in which he will give details of the new party.</p>
