<title>AUSTRALIA: War veteran dies as Australia remembers Anzacs.</title>
<headline>War veteran dies as Australia remembers Anzacs.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-25</dateline>

<p>An old soldier collapsed and died and several others were taken to hospital on Friday during emotion-filled ceremonies across Australia marking Anzac Day.</p>
<p>Organisers said the annual day of remembrance -- considered by many to be Australia's true national day -- was the biggest in years as hundreds of thousands of war veterans and spectators participated in marches and dawn ceremonies.</p>
<p>In Sydney, where police estimated 120,000 people watched as war veterans paraded along downtown George Street, one man died after collapsing during the march.</p>
<p>Another veteran was in stable condition after a heart attack and at least five people were taken to hospital for observation after collapsing.</p>
<p>Anzac Day ceremonies commemorate the landing of Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, Turkey in 1915.</p>
<p>Only 11 Australasian Gallipoli veterans survive, 10 in Australia and one in New Zealand. One of the survivors, 103-year-old Roy Longmore, rode in a car in the march in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand troops stormed ashore at Gallipoli on April 25 as part of a British-led Allied force. About 7,000 Australians and 2,000 New Zealanders were killed during the eight-month battle against Turkish forces.</p>
<p>Though a massive defeat for the Allies, the battle widely is seen as the birthplace of Australia's national identity.</p>
<p>Former naval officer Jack &quot;Crowbait&quot; Crowhurst, 80, who served in the North Atlantic, Europe and North Africa in World War Two, said Anzac Day was a time of celebration.</p>
<p>&quot;Those people that talk about this glorifying war - that couldn't be further from the truth,&quot; Crowhurst told The Australian Associated Press. &quot;It's about sharing comradeship from days gone by - that's all we've got left now.&quot;</p>
