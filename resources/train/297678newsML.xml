<p>Dutch company Friesland Dairy Foods may take over Nutricia International's 96.7 percent stake in the Hungarian dairy firm Hajdutej by April, a company official said.</p>
<p>The deal would be part of planned international cooperation between the two Dutch food producers, who are engaged in negotiations on opportunities to link or transfer to each other some of their activities.</p>
<p>&quot;I think (the takeover) will be completed by the general meeting of (Hajdutej) shareholders planned for April if the talks are successful,&quot; Sandor Mile, member of the Hajdutej's board of directors told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>He added that if Nutricia keeps control of Hajdutej, it is likely to delist the share from the BSE, but in case of a takeover Friesland may keep Hajdutej on the bourse as it could help the company to get to cheap sources for development.</p>
<p>Nutricia boosted its stake in Hajdutej to 96.7 percent from 79.6 percent by buying shares from managers and other owners at the end of December, making the free float of the stocks very illiquid, Mile said.</p>
