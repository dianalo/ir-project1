<headline>BA's Ayling says still hopeful of AA link.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-19</dateline>

<p>British Airways chief executive Bob Ayling said on Tuesday he remained optimistic BA would secure approvals for its proposed alliance with American Airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still very hopeful that it will happen. What we still don't know yet is what precisely will be the final rules in Europe,&quot; Ayling told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p>
<p>Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) proposed last December that BA and American should release 168 weekly runway slots at Heathrow -- enough to operate 12 daily return flights -- to give other airlines room to compete.</p>
<p>But industry sources say The European Union's Competition Commissioner has suggested to BA and the OFT that it should release 350 weekly slots, a far higher number than BA would ever be willing to give up.</p>
<p>Ayling indicated on Tuesday, however, that the proposed alliance might now be prepared to release at least the 168 slots demanded by the OFT.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we think that (number) will allow more competition,&quot; he said. &quot;It will reduce prices (fares) and increase choice and will give a more dynamic industry here in London.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the proposed alliance, BA intends to co-ordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.</p>
<p>But rival airlines, the EU Competition Commissioner and consumer groups have all objected to the deal, alleging that it would dominate Europe's biggest trans-Atlantic market with over 60 percent of all flights between Britain and the U.S.</p>
<p>BA and American argue that the deal would lead to lower fares because it would only go ahead if Britain and the U.S. agree a new open skies aviation trade pact to open up the market to free competition.</p>
<p>They also argue that they must be allowed to compete against rival transatlantic alliances which already have approvals for important transfer traffic in what they say is becoming an increasingly global market.</p>
<p>Having struggled for more than a year to agree terms with the European and U.S. competition authorities, BA has already threatened to abandon the deal if regulatory approvals are not granted before November.</p>
<p>But company sources have also said it has contingency plans in place should the deal be blocked, including the possibility of completing a looser marketing alliance with American which would fall within the terms of the current Anglo-U.S. aviation trade treaty.</p>
<p>The two airlines are still negotiating with the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic but industry sources say the next hurdle has to be agreement between the EU and Britain because any concessions would be critical to shaping the British negotiating position at open skies aviation trade talks with the U.S.</p>
<p>But the EU Competition Commission is not expected to make a decision before next month, and possibly not before October, following Brussels's summer break.</p>
<p> Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, BA's only British long-haul rival and a leading critic of the alliance, said in the same radio interview that he might drop his objections if enough slots at Heathrow were given up.</p>
<p>Branson said: &quot;if they are willing to give hundreds of slots ....we will be happy to consider it.&quot;</p>
<p>The debate shifts this week to a U.S Congressional aviation sub-committee panel which is visiting London as part of a study into international aviation trade issues.</p>
<p>Industry sources said the committee is expected to hear the views of both Virgin and British Airways during the visit.</p>
