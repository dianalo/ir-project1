<p>Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to issue consumer protection regulations for handguns Wednesday that effectively ban the sale of Saturday night specials in the state.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time anywhere, handguns will face the same common sense consumer safety standards as baby rattles, bicycles and teddy bears,&quot; Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger told reporters.</p>
<p>The regulations, which will be phased in beginning Oct, and be in full effect by June 1, 1998,  &quot;will require all handguns sold in our state to include child-proofing features, tamper-proof serial numbers and detailed consumer safety warnings,&quot; Harshbarger said.</p>
<p>The regulations require all handguns sold within the state to meet a minimum quality standing by passing tests for a specific standard for melting point, tensile strength and metal density, and a drop test measuring the potential for accidental discharge.</p>
<p>Those weapons that fail the performance tests will then be required to pass a performance test regarding malfunctions and part wear per rounds fired.</p>
<p>Officials estimated some 30 guns, most of them .22- or .25-caliber weapons, would likely be barred from sale in Massachusetts because &quot;they are junk. They are too cheap and too dangerous,&quot; said Eugene Passara, head of the Massachusetts Association of Chiefs of Police firearms committee. None of these is made in the state.</p>
<p>Makers of Saturday night specials, the cheap pistols usually used for impulsive crimes, are primarily made by five gunmakers in southern California: Lorcin, Jennings, Byrco Arms, Phoenix Arms and David Industries.</p>
<p>Firearms are the second leading cause of injury-related death to children and adolsecents in Massachusetts. Nationally, firearms are the fourth leading cause of accidental death in children aged five to 14 years old.</p>
<p>Harshbarger said he was prepared to defend the regulations, which need no legislative approval, in court.</p>
<p>Beginning Oct 1, handguns will come with a detailed written consumer safety warning under the regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;I think everyone agrees that if there's any product that should come with consumer safety warnings, it's a handgun,&quot; he said.</p>
