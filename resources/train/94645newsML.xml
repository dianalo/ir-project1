<p>Gordon Brown, finance spokesman for Britain's opposition Labour party, said there were &quot;substantial attractions in principle&quot; in European monetary union but any decision on British membership would be made in the light of the national interest. &quot;As far as Europe is concerned, I repeat what we said in the Road to the Manifesto -- there are substantial attractions in principle, but of course the decision has got to be made in the national interest,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>A decision would be made &quot;at the appropriate time,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Brown avoided a direct reply when pressed on whether a Labour government would try to meet the Maastricht criteria for joining a single currency, saying: &quot;We have got very strict rules governing public spending.&quot;</p>
<p>The Maastricht criteria and proposals for a stability pact were part of the regular discussions which Labour had with socialist and Social Democrat finance ministers in Europe.</p>
<p>Asked if he was in favour of a stability pact, Brown replied: &quot;I recognise that there has got to be some arrangement and of course the discussions are still continuing about what the nature of that has got to be.&quot;  </p>
<p>Outlining the attractions of monetary union, Brown said:</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we see advantages in principle in being part of monetary union. We see advantages in currency instability being eliminated. We see advantages in the ability to  get to lower interest rates. We see cheaper currency transactions as being to the advantage of British business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, of course, the decision about whether to move ahead or not must be made in the national interest at the appropriate time.&quot;</p>
