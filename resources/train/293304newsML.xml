<p>Leading Croatian commercial bank Zagrebacka Banka said on Wednesday it planned to increase personal loans to 400 million marks this year through the parent bank and one of its subidiaries, Pomorska Banka Split.</p>
<p>&quot;The resources are not an issue at all,&quot; director of the retail sector, Zvonimir Jurjevic, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He hinted that the bank might decide to revise its plans upwards as it expected a further increase in savings and other deposits. It was also counting on receiving more foreign funds after Zagrebacka gets a credit rating some time this year.</p>
<p>The bank today began taking new credit requests for housing loans which made up most personal demand last year.</p>
<p>Jurjevic mentioned no imminent cuts in credit rates although other terms, including deposit collateral, had been made easier.</p>
<p>In order to speed up lengthy application procedures it plans to involve a network of branches in dealing with client requests, Jurjevic said.</p>
<p>On the back of a strong rise in deposits Zagrebacka granted a total of 258 million marks in various personal credits last year or 31.5 percent more than in 1995.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange deposits rose 38 percent to 417 million marks in 1996 and their structure changed to 64 percent in favour of term deposits.</p>
<p>A rise in kuna savings, representing some 10 percent of the total, was even higher at 58 percent, boosting them to 860 million kuna.</p>
<p>Term savings jumped 128 percent to 215 million, thanks to what Jurjevic put down to a strong kuna exchange rate and an increase in term deposit rates, while interest on current account funds and sight kuna had been scrapped.</p>
<p>He said the interest on term deposits in kuna was around 10 percent on average, compared to five percent on comparable deposits in marks, the currency most trusted in Croatia.</p>
