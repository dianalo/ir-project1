<p>Austria's ATX index ended 0.36 percent down on Tuesday despite a promising start and continued lively investor interest in banking shares.</p>
<p>Traders reported selling from abroad in regioanl utility EVN and steelmaker VA Stahl. &quot;There are still some remaining sell orders from London,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The ATX index closed 5.26 points down at 1,458.87 -- well below the 1,476.62 intra-day high. Overall eight shares finished higher and 13 lower.</p>
<p>Despite the decline, most market participants remained bullish. &quot;If the international environment remains positive, prices should pick up again,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Bank Austria preferred, still buoyed by positive earnings figures released on Monday, were the leading ATX gainer and most actively traded share. They closed up 7.15 schillings, or 1.63 percent, at 446.95 schillings.</p>
<p>Preferred shares in Bank Austria unit Creditanstalt rose 4.9 schillings to 582.90, also on relatively high turnover.</p>
<p>The biggest ATX decliner was carton board maker Mayr-Melnhof. Traders said its 2.54 percent drop to 768 schillings was a reaction to Monday's 10 percent gain.</p>
<p>Insurer Wiener Staedtische shed four schillings to 1,086 after reporting an 11.9 pct drop in its first half premium income.</p>
<p>Construction firm Bau Holding firmed 5.29 percent to 923 schillings on news it planned to raise its base capital by 25 million schillings in September by issuing ordinary shares at a price of 950 schillings each.</p>
<p>August ATX futures were seven points down at 1,463.</p>
