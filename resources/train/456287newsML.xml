<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - ConAgra buy repeated.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez said Thursday she reiterated her buy rating on diversified food company ConAgra Inc, and raised her fiscal 1997 estimate by $0.01 a share to $2.68. Her fiscal 1998 estimate remains $3.05 a share.</p>
<p>-- Earlier, ConAgra reported third quarter earnings of $0.63 a share, in line with the First Call mean estimate, up from $0.55 a year ago.</p>
<p>-- Earnings were helped by a 11.3 percent decline in interest expense, while operating income was up about 6.5 percent.  </p>
<p>-- Ghez said the interest expense was lower due to ConAgra's sale last year of 50 percent of its worldwide barley malting business. That sale also contributed to a drop in sales and trimmed the rise in operating income.</p>
<p>-- &quot;I think with ConAgra, you have to look at the bottom line and that bottom line was good and in line (with estimates),&quot; Ghez said.</p>
<p>-- She added that the refrigerated foods segment posted a 35 percent rise in operating profit in the third quarter, which reflected a turn around in some of ConAgra's fresh meat operations.</p>
<p>-- ConAgra shares were off 1-1/8 at 55-5/8.</p>
