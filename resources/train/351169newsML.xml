<p>Coconut oil prices are expected to stay in a narrow range this week ahead of the Chinese New Year and the Moslem Eid-ul-Fitr, Philippine vegetable oil traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a lull this week,&quot; said a senior trader in one of the country's largest coconut oil millers.</p>
<p>The trader said he expected prices to hold at current levels, or at $760 to $800 per tonne CIF due to tight supplies.</p>
<p>Philippine coconut oil exports in January this year reached 85,000 tonnes from the year-ago 74,074 tonnes, trade group United Coconut Association of the Philippines Inc (UCAP) said on Monday citing preliminary data.</p>
<p>But Manila traders said coconut export numbers in January 1997 included a carry-over of up to 34,800 tonnes from December 1996 due to delayed ship loadings.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a vessel, MV Luctor, that started loading December 30, 1996 and finished on January 3, 1997. So the volume of 29,000 tonnes was included in the January 1997 export figure,&quot; a senior trader in one of the country's largest oil millers said.</p>
<p>Another trader put the coconut oil cargo of MV Luctor at 30,800 tonnes.</p>
<p>Traders also said another ship, MV Sea Stort, that was supposed to carry a cargo of 4,000 tonnes of coconut oil in December 1996 was delayed. &quot;The ship was able to load the coconut oil cargo last month,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected tight Philippine supply of coconut oil to ease in April this year.</p>
<p>Last week, coconut oil prices softened by an average of $7 at $770 per tonne CIF in Rotterdam from the previous $777, UCAP said.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the slide due to fresh supplies from MV Blue Sapphire with a cargo of 20,000 tonnes and MV Auriga with another cargo of 16,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh supplies of coconut oil from the Philippines boosted stocks in Rotterdam in the past two weeks,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Coconut oil stocks in Rotterdan increased to 21,593 tonnes as of January 27 as against 20,732 tonnes on January 20.</p>
