<headline>Dutch shares post gains after rates left unchanged.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares held most of their early gains to close higher on Thursday after stronger-than-expected earnings from chemicals group Akzo Nobel and the central bank left key interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>The AEX index of leading shares closed 8.02 points, or 0.82 percent, higher at 983.33. Its intra-day peak was at 988.26.</p>
<p>The market began on a firm footing, supported by a higher finish to the previous day's trading on Wall Street and second quarter net profits from Akzo Nobel surging 25 percent.</p>
<p>The chemicals group posted Q2 net profits of 459 million guilders, beating the highest analyst forecast of 427 million.</p>
<p>The company also said its full-year earnings would top last year's record 1.318 billion guilders.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results showed the company to be in good shape and some changed their recommendations for the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a very good performance,&quot; commented Peter van Schouten, chemicals analyst with MeesPierson.</p>
<p>&quot;It was absolutely needed, given that the first quarter was a disappointment,&quot; he said, adding &quot;We had the stock as a short-term buy. We are changing it to a strong buy.&quot;</p>
<p>The shares surged on the results hitting a high at 323.00 guilders before ending 18.30 up at 320.80 guilders.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank left its special advances rate unchanged at three percent on Thursday, after speculation in financial markets that a rise may be on the cards to bolster the guilder, which has fallen to four-year lows against the mark.</p>
<p>The news was interpreted as positive for the stock market but dealers said an unchanged rate had been factored in as the case for a rise had lessened in recent days.</p>
<p>According to a poll conducted by Reuters earlier on Thursday economists thought the need for a rise had been alleviated by a strengthening in the guilder/mark rate.</p>
<p>Paper and packaging firm KNP BT announced a second-quarter net profit from ordinary operations of 85 million guilders up from 51 million in the same 1996 quarter and towards the top end of analysts' range of forecasts between 61 and 90 million.</p>
<p>The shares moved little on the figures, ending 1.10 down at 47.60.</p>
