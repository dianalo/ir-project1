<p>Police on Monday were questioning a potential suspect in the disappearance of a four-year-old girl from Northern Ireland who vanished from her Florida hotel at the end of a two-week family vacation.</p>
<p>&quot;We just had one individual who was acting suspicious. It was brought to our attention and we're questioning that person,&quot; Ken Cox, an investigator involved in the case, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point any bit of information we have is something we are going to look into. Anyone acting suspicious in this area would be considered a suspect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While police questioned the suspect, described only as a local resident, her parents -- looking tense and teary-eyed -- begged quietly for the child's return.</p>
<p>&quot;Just return our little girl. Please,&quot; said Gerard McEvoy, who appeared at the news conference with his wife, Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Give her back to us,&quot; said Mrs McEvoy.</p>
<p>Brown-haired, brown-eyed Caoimhe McEvoy disappeared from her family's hotel rooms at the Quality Inn on International Drive in the middle of Orlando's tourist district at about 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT) on Sunday, Orange County Deputy Mike Pagan said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of law officers searched all night and into the day on Monday for the child or any evidence.</p>
<p>The family had returned from a theme park and were packing while Caoimhe disappeared and at first her parents did not realize she had vanished, Pagan said.</p>
<p>&quot;The girl walks out of the room and they thought she had gone to grandma's room, which was adjacent to mom and pop's room,&quot; he said. When they started looking for her they realized she was missing.</p>
<p>Four separate door-to-door hotel searches of the hotel turned up nothing. More than 100 law enforcement officials including local police, several canine units, members of the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and a NASA helicopter joined in the search in the rain.</p>
<p>The family, which was scheduled to return to Belfast on Monday, remained in their hotel room and met a counselor, Pagan said.</p>
<p>Police said the child stands 3 feet, 2 inches (93 cm) tall, weighs 30 pounds (13.6 kilograms) and was last seen barefoot in a blue-and-white polka dotted and striped shirt and underpants.</p>
<p>To help with the search, tourists and local residents began handing out flyers bearing the little girl's picture.</p>
