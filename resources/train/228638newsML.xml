<title>USA: Alleged vampire waives extradition to Florida.</title>
<headline>Alleged vampire waives extradition to Florida.</headline>
<dateline>BATON ROUGE, La 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>One of five teenagers from a self-styled &quot;vampire clan&quot; arrested for two Florida murders waived extradition on Monday and will return to Florida to stand trial, authorities said.</p>
<p>A closed extradition hearing for the other four, all juveniles, was expected later on Monday, court officials said.</p>
<p>Dana Lynn Cooper, 19, agreed in state district court to return to Eustice, Florida, about 25 miles north of Orlando, to face charges in the Nov. 25 bludgeoning deaths of Richard and Naoma Wendorf, the parents of one suspect.</p>
<p>Heather Wendorf, 15; Roderick Ferrell, 16; Howard Scott Anderson, 16; and Charity Keesee, 16, were arrested along with Cooper in Baton Rouge on Thanksgiving day while trying to check into a downtown motel.</p>
<p>Police said Keesee is accused of being an accessory after the fact in the murders, while the other four are believed to have participated in the slayings.</p>
<p>The teenagers were first reported missing in Murray, Kentucky, a small town near the western tip of the state, where they were known to be members of &quot;The Vampire Clan,&quot; a tight-knit, secretive group suspected of sucking blood from small animals and each other in graveyard rituals.</p>
<p>&quot;They like to cut their arms and suck the blood out of each other's arms,&quot; Murray Police Sgt. Mike Jump said. &quot;They've been known to kill a small animal and suck the blood out of it, supposedly to give them more power.&quot;</p>
<p>The teenagers, on the run since warrants were issued for them on Wednesday, were arrested after a Baton Rouge patrol officer spotted the Wendorfs' 1994 Ford Explorer pulling into the motel parking lot.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently one of the suspects made a telephone call ... from Baton Rouge which was traced here, and we located the pay phone from where the call originated,&quot; Baton Rouge police spokesman Don Kelly said.</p>
<p>The Explorer was towed back to Lake County, Florida, on Sunday, Baton Rouge police said. Florida police officers were expected to pick up Cooper and the four juveniles after extradition proceedings are completed.</p>
