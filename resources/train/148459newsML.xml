<p>In a remarkable upset election victory for the Labour Party sealed on Monday, the people of Malta rejected European Union membership and the Mediterranean island's VAT taxation system imposed to meet Europe's rules.</p>
<p>Labour leader Alfred Sant, 48, was sworn in as prime minister by President Ugo Mifsud Bonnici, a former minister of the Nationalist Party, which was defeated in Saturday's general election after nine years in power.</p>
<p>Official results after a record turnout of 97 percent from the nearly 275,000 electorate gave Labour 50.72 percent.</p>
<p>This was a majority of more than 7,600 votes over the Nationalists, who had been returned with a record 13,000-vote majority in the last election in 1992 and promised to take Malta into the EU.</p>
<p>Under Sant's leadership, Malta can be expected to forge closer ties with North Africa, including Libya, with whom it traditionally has close relations.</p>
<p>&quot;We want a special relationship with Europe but I argue that you start with your neighbours,&quot; Sant told Reuters earlier, adding that he wanted friendly relations with Libya although Malta would adhere to U.N. sanctions imposed on Tripoli over the Lockerbie aircraft bombing.</p>
<p>His party's policy was for &quot;two basic orientations...the European and Mediterranean directions&quot;.</p>
<p>Labour's manifesto promises &quot;an active endeavour for peace and friendship between Mediterranean countries.&quot; But it accepts Malta has &quot;deep political, commercial and cultural ties&quot; with Europe.</p>
<p>Except for VAT and pulling out of NATO's Partnership for Peace Programme, Sant was not expected to roll back on many of the changes already introduced under ousted prime minister Edward Fenech Adami's preparations for EU membership.</p>
<p>&quot;In the longer term, Labour has commitments with Europe and there will be a need for many discussions between Malta and the EU to have the close relationship Sant talks about,&quot; said one foreign political analyst, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Labour) are also committed to have Malta as a financial centre and will want to maintain the confidence of the financial community,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Times newspaper termed the election result for the 65-seat parliament &quot;the biggest upset for a quarter of a century&quot;.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Labour supporters streamed on Monday to Palace Square outside the 17th-century presidential palace for the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<p>A forest of red, and red and white, party flags waved to blasts from gas aerosol-activated horns, cheers and chants as the Labour leader's car arrived, a passage being forced through the crowd by police and party aides.</p>
<p>The flag-waving resumed in even greater delirium as Sant appeared on the balcony after the brief ceremony.</p>
<p>Blasts from fireworks reverberated through Valletta's ancient streets as drivers of cars decked with flags pursued their night of celebration into the day.</p>
<p>Sant, who transformed his party's image from a violence-prone centre of radicalism to appeal to middle-ground voters, promised a government &quot;for all the people&quot;.</p>
<p>On the Partnership for Peace, which Malta joined last year, Sant told Reuters earlier that his party opposed a return to a fortress island.</p>
<p>He was unhappy about the increased visits by Western naval vessels to Malta -- awarded the British George Cross in 1942 for bravery withstanding Italian and German wartime attacks.</p>
<p>Pulling out of the Partnership &quot;will be my first priority&quot;.</p>
<p>It would be followed by legislation to abolish VAT and replace it with customs tariffs, undercutting a basis of EU membership and signalling Malta's withdrawal of its bid.</p>
<p>Discontent with VAT, with a standard rate of 15 percent, has been widespread, both for its impact on inflation, running officially at around four percent, and for perceived meddling by officialdom in traditionally secretive family businesses.</p>
