<p>Pressure built on world industrial metal markets on Thursday when the price of copper fell conclusively below $1,900 per tonne.</p>
<p>Speculators opted to sell the sector as end-user demand in the global economy continues to run at mediocre levels.</p>
<p>Copper is now at its weakest since mid-July and aluminium is at a two-year low. Other industrial metals such as zinc, lead, nickel and tin also look shaky.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is one of sentiment. When it is poor as it is now it spreads throughout the market and one metal can easily pull others lower with it,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Analyst Martin Squires at London Metal Exchange (LME) broker Rudolf Wolff pinpointed copper on Thursday after prices breached $1,900 which was an important technical chart support level.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not look very good at the moment. It could well go down to $1,825 and $1,800,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The market fell to $1,862 a tonne at one stage.</p>
<p>Given the lack of confidence it may well return to two-year lows seen in June of $1,745 during a panic sell-off after the Sumitomo Corp scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;There was positive news earlier this week of stocks declining but it has been discounted,&quot; Squires said.</p>
<p>Aluminium hit a low at $1,429 on Thursday with rising stocks a highly-visible signal of sluggish industrial demand.</p>
<p>&quot;There is insufficient demand in the market at the moment to hold the bears at bay...</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, we have not seen the necessary rise in U.S demand following the Labour Day holiday nor in Europe,&quot; brokerage GNI Ltd said in a daily commentary.</p>
<p>Analysts said a pick-up in buying by industry had been expected after the end of the slow northern summer.</p>
<p>But Squires said &quot;people are just operating on a hand-to- mouth basis...nobody wants to buy in case prices go lower still.&quot;</p>
<p>Metal fabricators, mills and other users continued to de-stock, operating off their own working inventories.</p>
<p>With the LME's two big markets under pressure, the rest of the metals complex is pressured, even though there are some positive fundamental factors.</p>
<p>Zinc is showing signs of falling under $1,000, trading at $1,005 on Thursday, while lead is gradually getting close to dropping under $800 after business down to $805.</p>
<p>Low metal prices so far this year hit mining firms hard.</p>
<p>On Thursday Anglo-Australian giant RTZ-CRA reported a 22 percent slide in net adjusted earnings to $552 million in the first half of 1996, blaming weak metal prices, above all copper.</p>
<p>But the company said that in its view the outlook for all base metals, with the probable exception of copper, was bullish over the remainder of 1996 and through 1997.</p>
<p>The table in $/tonne shows how prices have fallen --</p>
<p>		CURRENT PRICE	 SEPT 1996 HIGH</p>
<p>    Copper	1,875		   2,165</p>
<p>    Aluminium   1,432		   1,520</p>
<p>    Nickel	7,565		   7,850</p>
<p>    Lead	    812		     820</p>
<p>    Zinc	  1,010		   1,043</p>
<p>    Tin	   6,160		   6,300</p>
