<title>USA: Freeze threat to US corn, soy seen light Thursday.</title>
<headline>Freeze threat to US corn, soy seen light Thursday.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>About one-third of the corn and soybeans in Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota will be at risk if temperatures fall below freezing Thursday morning, but agronomists expected frost damage to be light.</p>
<p>&quot;Your absolute yield loss is not going to be all that great,&quot; said Don White, University of Illinois agronomist. &quot;Your real problem is going to be drying and harvest. I think it's going to have to get colder than they're predicting to do any serious damage.&quot;</p>
<p>Meteorologists forecast below-freezing temperatures Thursday morning for parts of Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.  </p>
<p>The average frost date for Decatur, Ill. is Oct 17.</p>
<p>Illinois' corn was 59 percent mature as of Sunday, behind 80 percent average, the state's agricultural statistics service said. Forty-five percent of the soybeans were dropping leaves, compared with 82 percent average.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very little corn in northern Illinios that is really physiologically mature but we're probably looking at 25 percent that's going to lose five to 10 percent yield,&quot; said Lyle Paul, University of Illinois agronomist in Dekalb.</p>
<p>Frost slows drying of immature corn, delays harvest and makes the plants more susceptible to disease, White said.  </p>
<p>Below freezing temperatures cause soybeans that have not turned color to remain green and can reduce seed size.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll lose a little yield but not a lot,&quot; Paul said, referring to soybeans.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, soybean development was progressing well but corn progress was still lagging average, said Kent Thiessy, Minnesota extension educator for Blue Earth County.</p>
<p>Minnesota corn was 43 percent mature as of Sunday, up from 25 percent the previous week but behind the 61 percent average. Eighty-three percent of soybeans were shedding leaves, slightly ahead of the average pace of 79 percent.  </p>
<p>The average frost date for Minneapolis is Oct 7.</p>
<p>&quot;In south-central Minnesota, the killing frost tonight will probably have a fairly minimal effect,&quot; Thiessy said. &quot;Eighty to 85 percent of the soybeans probably won't have much damage and less than 10 percent would be severely damaged.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted some areas already saw a frost in mid-September that damaged crops in low-lying areas.</p>
<p>In Iowa, corn was 63 percent mature as of Sunday, according to the Iowa Agricultural Statistics Service. The maturity pace was up from 40 percent the previous week but well behind the 90 percent of a year ago and 78 percent average.</p>
