<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve was expected to decide on Tuesday to hold interest rates steady amid hopes that the see-saw U.S. economy is settling into steady growth as the year ends, analysts said.</p>
<p>The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee began its meeting as scheduled at 9 a.m. EST (1400 GMT), a spokesman said. It was expected to announce its rate decision at about 2:15 p.m. EST (1915 GMT).</p>
<p>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his fellow policy-makers have not changed rates since January and analysts see no reason for this meeting to be any different.</p>
<p>They are divided though over the outlook for rates next year, depending on whether they see growth picking back up or slackening further.</p>
<p>Recent statistics have portrayed an economy with pockets of weakness and strength that remains surprisingly free of any inflationary tendencies over 5-1/2 years into an expansion.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that housing starts jumped by a bigger-than-expected 9.2 percent in November. But that followed two months of declines.</p>
<p>In public speeches and private conversations in recent days, central bank officials have voiced broad satisfaction with the shape of the economy.</p>
<p>Greenspan earlier this month called inflation &quot;low,&quot; although he added that its future course remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Labour markets are tight and unemployment low, raising the risk of stepped-up wage demands. But product markets are, in Greenspan's words, &quot;comfortable,&quot; indicating no shortages that could lead to higher prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The risks to the economy seem pretty evenly balanced,&quot; one official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>That is not the way it looked just a few months ago. At that time, the economy was coming off a strong second quarter and seemed on the verge of overheating.</p>
<p>But since then, growth has slowed -- to an annualized 2 percent in the third quarter from 4.7 percent in the second.</p>
<p>&quot;After a steamy first half, economic growth is settling down close to Chairman Greenspan's speed limit of 2.25 percent,&quot; said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp.</p>
<p>The economic slowdown should allow Fed policy-makers to adopt an even-handed policy directive at their meeting on Tuesday. That would be a shift from the stance of the late summer and early fall, when the FOMC tilted policy in the direction of higher rates, without actually raising them.</p>
<p>The key federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans, now stands at 5.25 percent. The discount rate the Fed charges the banks is 5 percent.</p>
<p>The steady stance does not mean that Fed policy-makers, who are paid to worry about the economy, have no concerns.</p>
<p>Greenspan warned this month of the dangers posed to the economy when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and asset markets because that could lead to a crash.</p>
<p>Analysts doubt though that the Fed would raise interest rates merely to rein in the stock market, if only because that would risk triggering the very crash they are seeking to avoid.</p>
