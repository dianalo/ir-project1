<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch give Europe's cocoa data a positive start.</title>

<p>A small rise in the Dutch cocoa grind figure in the first quarter this year surprised some who were looking for a flat to slightly lower number and gave further indication of solid underlying demand, analysts said.</p>
<p>The amount of cocoa beans ground in the Netherlands during the first quarter rose to 102,338 tonnes from 100,866 tonnes in the same period a year earlier, an increase of 1.46 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure was pretty respectable,&quot; one analyst commented. &quot;We haven't got off to a bad start at all,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Dutch grind, the world's largest, is the first to appear in western Europe -- Germany and Britain are expected to release their data early next week and the final total will be seen as a key barometer of demand health.</p>
<p>Some industry sources had anticipated a decline in the Dutch grind as one of the smaller processors has switched to using partly cocoa liquor instead of beans since the first quarter 1996. The figures for last year were also exceptionally strong.</p>
<p>&quot;If we take out the liquor factor, then the major Dutch grinders must be processing around six percent more and that's pretty good,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main players are grinding slightly more cocoa and have no problems on the sales side,&quot; one Dutch industry source said.</p>
<p>The London futures market showed little reaction to the news and the benchmark July contract was down five stg at 1,053 by mid-morning, amid a technical correction to recent gains.</p>
<p>And analysts also noted that the full picture would not become clear until other countries had released their figures.</p>
<p>&quot;I still feel the German grind will be much lower, so we can't get too excited yet,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>And in any case, fairly uninspiring numbers have been well factored into cocoa prices, others pointed out.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are going to look disappointing, but they are actually concealing steady to good consumption in Europe,&quot; Refco Inc analyst Ann Prendergast in New York said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The grinds may be misleading because many producers have started to process their cocoa, plus last year's first quarter grinds were extremely high.&quot;</p>
<p>London brokerage GNI were equally upbeat on the state of demand.</p>
<p>&quot;While there is a general feeling that they (European grind figures) will fail to match the impressive figures of last year, increased processed imports from origin are showing underlying consumption remains robust,&quot; it said.</p>
