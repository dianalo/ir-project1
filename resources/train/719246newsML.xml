<headline>Cambodia regrets ASEAN membership delay.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>A Cambodian government spokesman said on Thursday ASEAN's decision to postpone Phnom Penh's membership of the grouping was regrettable and he hoped it would not encourage further conflict in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret it very much, but we hope ASEAN won't encourage the fighting in Cambodia,&quot; Secretary of State for Information Khieu Kanharith told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Khieu Kanharith, a senior member of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's political party, did not elaborate when asked why the decision to postpone Cambodia's membership in the Association of South East Nations might encourage conflict, but said Cambodia's problems were a legacy of the Cold War.</p>
<p>&quot;They have the right to decide who and when to become a member, but they forget that everything here is the remains of the Cold War,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget that they have been playing a role in all of these things,&quot; he said, apparently referring to ASEAN's support for a three-party guerrilla alliance until a 1991 peace treaty officially ended Cambodia's war. &quot;I hope this is a temporary decision.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking before the announcement, Hun Sen said if ASEAN interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs, Cambodia would not want to join the group. ASEAN groups Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
