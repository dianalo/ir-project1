<p>French holding company CGIP looks set to provide a &quot;French solution&quot; to the future of car parts supplier Valeo by buying a 28 percent stake, but analysts say the politically-driven deal robs shareholders of the best offer.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a classic French blocking operation. They've thwarted a buyout,&quot; said a London-based car analyst.</p>
<p>CGIP announced on Thursday night it would sell half of its 20 percent stake in packaging group Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co to finance the purchase of the Valeo stake from the Cerus company and to balance out its holdings.</p>
<p>Cerus is the French holding company of Italian businessman Carlo De Benedetti, who has been looking for a buyer for his Valeo stock for nearly a year.</p>
<p>The Paris government and French car manufacturers have been trying to arrange a French purchase of the stake to fend off a buyout bid by U.S. or other foreign competitors.</p>
<p>General Motors' G.M Delphi Automotive Systems and TRW Inc were reported to be interested in acquiring Valeo but were put off by boycott threats from the two French carmakers.</p>
<p>Valeo, the second biggest car components group in Europe and 16th worldwide, is the leading supplier to PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault SA.</p>
<p>CGIP said its board, which met on Thursday, wanted to conclude a deal to buy the stake but did not disclose terms.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the negotiations say CGIP has not yet put an offer on the table. At current market prices, Cerus's holding in Valeo is worth more than five billion francs.</p>
<p>A deal is not expected to be concluded for at least a month as the sale of CGIP's Crown Cork shares will not take place before the end of October, a CGIP spokeswoman said. Those shares are expected to fetch around three billion francs.</p>
<p>Analysts and industry sources say a rival bid for the Valeo stake could still emerge but CGIP's move will probably succeed.</p>
<p>Cerus's stake shot up nearly six percent to 131 francs, while CGIP's stock fell nearly three percent to 1,185 francs.</p>
<p>Under French bourse rules, the purchase of less than 33 percent of a company's share capital does not require a public takeover offer, and CGIP has previously denied reports of buyout plans.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear there won't be a buyout. There's no point dreaming,&quot; a French equities analyst said.</p>
<p>Traders said Cerus and CGIP were buying Valeo shares in the open market on Friday. The stock closed up 2.60 francs at 281.50. Analysts said the two companies want to boost the price closer to the level De Benedetti is demanding.</p>
<p>A buyer of a minority stake may not offer a premium of more than 10 percent of the market price, but Cerus previously said it was expecting an offer that would take into account its expectation that the share would be worth 400 francs in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Analysts say it remains unclear whether De Benedetti, who resigned earlier this month as chairman of Olivetti, needs cash urgently or will drive a hard bargain. Some forecast he would settle for between 330 and 350 francs a share.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cerus confirmed the group was discussing the sale of its Valeo stake to CGIP but declined to say whether it was in discussions with any other groups.</p>
<p>&quot;The CGIP deal is not in the interests of the minority shareholders -- or of the biggest shareholder (de Benedetti) for that matter,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>He said De Benedetti would stand to get a better offer from an automotive company willing to launch a bid for control of Valeo as part of the industry trend toward rapid consolidation.</p>
<p>&quot;A tie-up with a big U.S. firm would have allowed the merged entity to leapfrog its competitors and secure its long-term future as one of the top five (suppliers) in an industry that's consolidating dramatically,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>He said the deal proposed by CGIP was a &quot;French political solution&quot; that made little sense industrially.</p>
<p>&quot;What possible logic is there other than to keep Valeo French in what is one of the most global industries? This is a car parts company. It's not critical to the defence of France,&quot; he said. &quot;This sends a clear message to where shareholders rank in a lot of French industrial companies -- nowhere.&quot;</p>
