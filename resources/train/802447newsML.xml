<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has urged European Union leaders to keep open the prospect of EU membership for Cyprus and Turkey as an incentive for progress on peace talks, her spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>On the day that U.N. talks aimed at resolving the division of Cyprus ended in disarray, State Department spokesman James Rubin refused to say whether Washington thought the EU had reacted constructively to Albright's entreaties.</p>
<p>He told reporters the United States did not expect the U.N. talks to reconvene until next year and stressed &quot;there's plenty of time&quot; for the EU to act.</p>
<p>The U.N. talks in Switzerland ended with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders wrangling in public.</p>
<p>Glafcos Clerides, president of the internationally recognized Greek Cypriot government in the south of the island, threatened to pull out of the talks if the EU delayed its plans to start entry talks for Cyprus early next year.</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash vowed to walk out if the plan went ahead.</p>
<p>Rubin called the discussions in Switzerland useful and said their success must be judged over the long term.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a long-running dispute. There are significant passions and emotions on both sides. We don't expect these problems to be resolved easily,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As for the timing of more talks, Rubin said, &quot;We don't expect another round until the elections on Cyprus and so that will probably be next year.&quot;</p>
<p>He reiterated the U.S. view in support of &quot;both EU membership and the desires of Turkey and Cyprus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the EU accession process provides incentives for the concerned parties to move ahead to achieve a just and viable settlement to the Cyprus dispute,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Rubin stressed the U.S. view that it was up to the EU to determine its own membership.</p>
<p>The United States has named Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Bosnia peace agreement, to take on Cyprus and he plans a trip to the region this fall.</p>
<p>Holbrooke, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian affairs, is a strong advocate of the view that Turkey must be integrated fully into Europe, including the EU.</p>
<p>Cypriot Greeks and Turks have been estranged since 1963 when a government in which both took part collapsed amid violence. Turkey invaded the northern third in 1974 after a coup in the capital Nicosia engineered by the rightist junta then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>Although the two rival communities have been living in mostly peaceful separation, the post-1974 partition has led to an entrenching of positions with no sign of compromise.</p>
<p>In recent months, the EU has increasingly made clear its disinclination to admit Turkey any time soon, asserting that Ankara has to improve its human rights record.</p>
<p>EU members are also concerned about the impact a free flow of Turkish workers would have on their economies.</p>
