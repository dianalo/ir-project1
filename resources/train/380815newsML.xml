<p>American Airlines slashed fares on Saturday to woo back customers scared off by a threatened pilots' strike, but travelers may still steer clear of the airline until its labor troubles are resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;The next few months will be a mess. Because of the uncertainty hanging around them for the 60 days or so, people may still likely book away from them,&quot; said Jeffrey Long, an airline analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton intervened early on Saturday to halt a strike at the nation's second largest airline, appointing a board to study the dispute and postponing a pilots' walkout for at least 60 days.</p>
<p>American is a unit of Fort Worth-based AMR Corp.</p>
<p>Although the pilot strike lasted a mere 24 minutes, American lost tens of millions of dollars as customers changed reservations to other carriers to avoid being stranded.</p>
<p>Analysts said while a strike would have been far more costly, American's continuing labor problems would still eat away at its profits -- with some estimating losses of up to $200 milion over the next few months as the airline tried to win back customers through steep fare discounts.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after Clinton's intervention, American cut fares up to 50 percent on 21-day excursion fares, 40 percent on portions of tour packages and doubled frequent flier mile credits.</p>
<p>While the cheap fares offer a short-term bonanza, many passengers may be afraid of another disruption as the 60-day period draws to a close, analysts said.</p>
<p>Trans World Airlines Inc quickly matched American's new fares, but said it had not decided whether to match the frequent flier mile offer. Most other carriers said they did not cut fares, but would continue to study their options.</p>
<p>&quot;Our planes are already full without having to to sell cheap tickets to fill seats,&quot; said Delta Air Lines Inc spokesman Bob Harper.</p>
<p>Since most major carriers already announced spring and summer sale fares earlier this month, industry analysts doubted other airlines would cut prices to match American.</p>
<p>Rival carriers have already benefitted from American's problems. Airlines grabbed extra passengers, revenue and goodwill by accommodating travelers during the recent confusion. But analysts said it was too early to predict how much the windfall would add to the other airlines' bottom line.</p>
<p>Some airlines said they would continue to add extra flight and staffing over the next few days in key markets to take advantage of the lingering problems at American.</p>
<p>TWA said it would add extra capacity throughout the weekend from New York to San Juan. Continental also said it would add seat capacity on flights between Dallas and Newark and Newark and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Airlines such as UAL Corp's United Airlines and Delta also could steal extra marketshare in Chicago, Dallas and on transcontinental routes during the next two months.</p>
