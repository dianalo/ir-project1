<p>Czech net tourism income, a major component in the country's balance of payments, is expected to fall to $1.1 billion in 1996 from $1.25 billion in 1995, the Ministry for Local Development said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The fall in net income, which has helped limit the growth of an already large current account deficit, was attributed to a rise in the total amount spent by Czechs travelling abroad.</p>
<p>The ministry said in a report that total 1996 revenue from tourism was expected to rise by 32 percent to $3.8 billion, while expenditure was seen rising 65.6 percent to $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>The ministry said its full-year estimates were based on 11-month results provided by the Czech Statistical Bureau plus the ministry's forecasts for December.</p>
<p>An estimated total of 107 million foreign visits were expected to be recorded in the Czech Republic last year, up 9.1 percent from 98.1 million in 1995, but the figures imply that revenue was equal to about $35.50 per visit.</p>
<p>Traditionally, many visits recorded are day-trips primarily made by neighbouring Germans, Austrians, and Poles.</p>
<p>According to the 11-month figures, visits from neighbouring states were up 13.3 percent, year-on-year, to 76.4 million visits, with 47 million visits from Germany, 21.3 million from Poland 17 million from Slovakia and 15 million from Austria.</p>
<p>Airport arrivals from abroad for January-November period were up 18.5 percent to roughly 1.4 million, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a total 48 million Czech visits abroad were expected for the whole of 1996, up seven percent year-on-year, compared with 44.9 million in 1995, the report said.</p>
<p>The Czech current account had a $3.083 billion deficit in the January-September period, up from $684 million in the same period of 1995, primarily because of a large foreign trade gap.</p>
<p>The foreign trade deficit was 140 billion crowns in the first 11 months of 1996, up from an 81 billion shortfall in the same period of the previous year.</p>
