<headline>Former UK foreign minister to become Lord Hurd.</headline>

<p>Douglas Hurd, Britain's Foreign Secretary from 1989 to 1995, is to become a Lord, allowing him to sit in the upper house of Parliament after the May 1 election, Prime Minister John Major's office said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hurd is among 21 mostly elderly politicians retiring from the House of Commons whom Queen Elizabeth, on Major's recommendation, is ennobling.</p>
<p>As well as Hurd, the 10 Conservatives honoured include outgoing Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew.</p>
<p>The seven-strong list of new peers from the opposition Labour Party is headed by Roy Hattersley, the party's deputy leader from 1983 to 1992.</p>
<p>Other new peers include Sir David Steel, who led the minority Liberal Party for 12 years until 1988, and Sir James Molyneaux, former leader of the Ulster Unionists, the main pro-British Protestant party in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>If Labour win the election, as opinion polls show they are likely to do, they are pledged to begin a radical shake-up of the unelected House of Lords which has a huge inbuilt Conservative majority.</p>
<p>But the new peers will not, initially at least, be affected. Labour says their first step will be to end the right of aristocrats from centuries-old noble families who have inherited their titles to vote in the upper house.</p>
