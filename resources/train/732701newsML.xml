<headline>USDA floating plan to tap EEP, PL480 aid funds.</headline>

<p>Washington, July 16 (Reuter) U.S. Agriculture Department officials have floated a plan that would allow them to replenish two emergency commodity reserves by taking money from the United State's main agricultural export subsidy and food aid programs.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think at this point it's a formal proposal,&quot; according to one Senate aide briefed by USDA officials on the plan. &quot;It's just something that people are kicking around.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman acknowledged that his department was looking at issue, but provided no detail.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're talking with the Hill about various ways that we deal with both exports and disaster. That's fair,&quot; Glickman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't come up with any specific solutions yet,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the department would have the authority to use funds from the title I &quot;market development&quot; portion of the PL480 food aid program and from the Export Enhancement Program to replenish the four-million-tonne Food Security Commodity Reserve and the smaller Disaster Reserve Assistance Program.  </p>
<p>Both reserves have been drawn down in recent years in response to emergency conditions in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>DRAP was tapped to provide livestock feed assistance last summer in Texas and last winter in North Dakota.</p>
<p>The FSCR has been drawn down to about 2.5 million tonnes over the past several years to allow USDA to continue overseas wheat donations in the face of tight U.S. wheat supplies.</p>
<p>In recent years, Congress has continued funding for title I of PL480 at about $290 million annually. Under title I, participating countries buy U.S. commodities using long-term, low-interest loans provided by USDA.  </p>
<p>Congress has not been so generous to EEP, which USDA has not used for nearly two years because of market conditions that have allowed the U.S. to export without subsidies.</p>
<p>Congress slashed funding for EEP in fiscal 1997 to $10 million, from an initial allocation of $100 million, to provide assistance for Northern Plains flood victims.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1998, which begins October 1, Congress appears intent to set EEP funding somewhere between $150 million and $205 million, despite USDA's request that the program be fully funded at $500 million.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why it's unfair to characterize (USDA's idea) as a raid on EEP,&quot; the Senate aide noted. &quot;The big raid on EEP has been done by Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>One House aide described USDA's trial balloon as a throwback to outdated farm policies.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like something right out of 1962,&quot; the aide said.</p>
<p>He described USDA's plan as an attempt manage market prices by buying surplus domestic supplies and shipping it overseas as food aid.</p>
