<p>Slovak Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik on Tuesday said he expected the Slovak crown exchange rate to stay stable without significant fluctuations at least through the middle of 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of the (Slovak) crown has been stabilising in recent weeks and we do not expect any dramatic changes, or fluctuations, at least through around the middle of 1998,&quot; Kozlik said after a regular cabinet session.  </p>
<p>Kozlik did not elaborate further.</p>
<p>The Slovak was crown under strong speculative pressure in May and June but the central bank's (NBS) move radically to curb access to crown funds on the local interbank market appeared to have helped keep the currency stable.</p>
<p>The crown's exhange rate has been moving between the central parity of its mark/dollar basket and -1.0 percent on the basket's weak side in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>However, many analysts have said the country's weak foreign trade results and yawning current account deficit will make the currency vulnerable to further attacks.</p>
<p>Both the NBS and government officials, including Kozlik, have repeatedly and strictly rejected any possibility of an administrative devaluation of the crown.</p>
<p>Some economists, however, predict the crown would depreciate by three to four percent by the end of this year against major currencies given the country's foreign trade problems.</p>
<p>Slovakia's foreign trade deficit widened more than two billion crowns in June to total 32.572 billion crowns for the first six months of this year,</p>
