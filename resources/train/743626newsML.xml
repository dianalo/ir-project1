<p>June retail sales data due on Wednesday will provide crucial evidence on activity in Britain's simmering consumer sector, with most economists expecting another strong rise in turnover.</p>
<p>The June figures, due at 0830 GMT on Wednesday, will also provide eagerly awaited clues about the extent to which consumers are spending multi-billion-pound windfalls dished out by building societies converting into banks and floating on the stock market.</p>
<p>The Reuters consensus forecast suggests sales rose by 0.4 percent in June compared with May's shock 1.1 percent rise. This would allow the year-on-year rate to ease to 4.5 percent from 5.3 in May.</p>
<p>&quot;A key reason for the sharp increase in sales in May is likely to have been the windfall payouts totalling 4.0 billion pounds at the beginning of the month. Similarly sales are likely to have been boosted in June,&quot; said Dharshini David, UK economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>She forecast a 1.0 percent leap in June sales, noting the month saw the biggest chunk of windfall cash due this year paid out to building society members.</p>
<p>Halifax Plc paid out around 18 billion pounds to savers and borrowers in early June. This was swiftly followed by a windfall payout of 4.0 billion pounds from insurer Norwich Union.</p>
<p>Economists estimate windfalls will total 35 billion pounds this year.</p>
<p>David Philpotts, UK economist at Schroders, said the result of this flood of cash in June was another bumper month for shops around the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer confidence rose to a near record level in the month, presumably in response to the windfall shares from the Halifax conversion, a quarter of which were cashed in straight away.&quot;</p>
<p>Consumer confidence, as measured by the European Union/GfK survey, rose to +7.0 in June compared with a long-term average of -10, he said.</p>
<p>In addition, the component of the survey which measures whether consumers think it is a good time to make a major purchase shot higher.</p>
<p>Philpotts forecast sales up 0.7 percent last month.</p>
<p>Economists said anecdotal evidence also suggested a significant proportion of windfalls quickly found their way into the stores sector.</p>
<p>Britain's biggest electrical retailer Dixons said earlier this month a surge in sales in May and June was fuelled by windfall cash.</p>
<p>&quot;The useful thing about the comments from Dixons is that it is precisely this sort of business that would benefit if consumers were spending their windfalls,&quot; said Andrew Snowball, economist at the Co-operative Bank.</p>
<p>But other analysts noted the survey evidence for the period was mixed and therefore inconclusive.</p>
<p>The British Retail Consortium said sales were slower in June than May as poor weather hit activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CBI said sales gathered pace, rising above expectations, with a balance of 39 percent of shops reporting higher sales compared with 21 percent in May.</p>
<p>&quot;The June retail sales report is difficult to call,&quot; said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;Bad weather will have disrupted sales, but on the other hand sales could have benefited from the windfalls. Overall we expect flat sales on the month.&quot;</p>
