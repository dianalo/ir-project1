<title>FRANCE: Algerian court sentences journalists up to 3 years.</title>
<headline>Algerian court sentences journalists up to 3 years.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>An Algerian court on Tuesday handed down suspended jail sentence to three journalists and ordered their newspaper shut for six months over a controversial cartoon, journalists said.</p>
<p>Algiers' court convicted the three, from the French language daily La Tribune, on a charge of undermining the country's flag following the printing of a cartoon two months ago, the journalists added, speaking by telephone from Algiers.</p>
<p>The court sentenced cartoonist Lamari Chawki to three years imprisonment, director Kheireddine Ameyar to one year, and editor Baya Gacemi to six months. All the sentences were suspended.</p>
<p>The accused denied the cartoon was meant to undermine the national flag and said the move was aimed at further curbing press freedom.</p>
<p>The authorities banned La Tribune early in July and locked its doors, saying the newspaper cartoon mocked the Algerian flag ahead of celebrations of Algeria's independence day.</p>
<p>La Tribune was suspended last year and several other papers have been temporarily closed since 1993.</p>
<p>More than 50 journalists have been killed in Algeria since 1993 when Moslem guerrillas turned their guns against the media accusing them of siding with the government they are trying to topple through a nearly five-year-old rebellion.</p>
<p>An estimated 50,000 people have been killed in the conflict which erupted after the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election which Islamic fundamentalists were poised to win.</p>
