<p>Peru plans to use diplomacy and not its newly purchased fighter planes against Ecuador as its &quot;weapon&quot; in their simmering border dispute, President Alberto Fujimori said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The weapon we want to prioritize is the weapon of international law, of dialogue,&quot; Fujimori said in a speech celebrating Peru's Army Day.</p>
<p>Denying media reports from Ecuador that Peru had a so-called &quot;Victory Plan&quot; to attack its neighbour after buying at least a dozen Russian fighter planes, Fujimori said Lima had instead a &quot;Protocol Plan ... whose weapons are high-calibre arguments.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the Andean neighbours fought a brief border war at the beginning of 1995, they have been locked in peace negotiations over their disputed frontier.</p>
<p>The two sides set the border under the 1942 Rio Protocol treaty, but Ecuador later renounced the pact, saying it signed under pressure.</p>
<p>In October, Peru and Ecuador appeared to take a major step toward solving their decades-old dispute by agreeing to start talks, scheduled for Dec. 20 in Brasilia, for a final settlement over the remote strip of Amazon jungle.</p>
<p>Ahead of the countries' traditionally delicate December-February period, tensions flared up last month when Peru bought the MiG fighter jets.</p>
<p>Ecuador claimed the purchase was excessive and could lead to an arms race.</p>
