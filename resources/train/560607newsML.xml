<headline>Optical says recalls SensiCath Sensors.</headline>
<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Optical Sensors Inc said it initiated a voluntary action to retrieve SensiCath Sensors that are in customers' inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;Because Optical Sensors is in the initial stage of distributing sensors, fewer than 20 customer sites are affected by the product retrieval,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The company said certain sensors have been found &quot;to perform outside of Optical Sensors' performance specifications under some clinical conditions.&quot;  </p>
<p>Chief executive Sam Humphries said, &quot;No instances of patient injury or compromised care have occurred. However, we are taking this aggressive action to assure the quality of our product and preserve the confidence of our customers in Optical Sensors as a prudent and conservative company.</p>
<p>&quot;The FDA has been notified of our action, and as a result our action may be classified as a product recall by the FDA.&quot;</p>
<p>Optical said it will experience an interruption in the supply of product to customers, but anticipates resumption of production as soon as acceptable quality levels are assured.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to have every confidence in our technology and will provide our customers with a specific timetable for resuming product distribution as soon as possible,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Optical Sensors has developed a patient-attached, on-demand arterial blood gas monitoring system that provides results within 60 seconds without exposure to potentially infectious blood or depleting the patient's blood supply.</p>
