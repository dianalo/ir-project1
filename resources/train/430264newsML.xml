<p>Chinese officials said on Monday there was no evidence to link last week's bus bombing in Beijing to attacks in the restive region of Xinjiang, but exiled separatists did not rule out a connection.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we have uncovered no connection,&quot; Beijing Mayor Jia Qingling told reporters when asked if the attacks in Beijing and Moslem Xinjiang were related.</p>
<p>Jia made the remarks before the start of a session of parliament, which is holding its annual session in Beijing.</p>
<p>An exiled group in the central Asian state of Kazakhstan said ethnic Uighur separatists could have been behind Friday's bomb attack on a bus during rush hour in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not rule out that this action was taken by separatist groups from Urumqi,&quot; Modan Mukhlisi, spokesman for the Uighur separatist United National Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The group has claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on three buses in Urumqi, capital of the far western region of Xinjiang, on February 25.</p>
<p>Other Chinese officials were unwilling to link the Beijing and Xinjiang bomb attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;This (Beijing bombing) incident does not have a lot of similarities with those in Urumqi,&quot; said Xinjiang Communist Party boss Wang Lequan.</p>
<p>&quot;Staging bomb attacks is not exclusive to Xinjiang people,&quot; Wang told reporters at the parliament session.</p>
<p>State-controlled media said no one died in the Beijing bombing but local sources said at least two people were killed about 30 wounded. The Urumqi bombings killed nine and wounded 74.</p>
<p>Exiled ethnic Uighurs, who want to set up an independent state of &quot;East Turkestan&quot; in Xinjiang, have vowed to stage more attacks until they gain &quot;complete freedom&quot; for their homeland.</p>
<p>Minister of Public Security Tao Siju also denied any link between the Beijing bombing and Moslem Uighur exiles, but said authorities were still investigating.</p>
<p>Mayor Jia said he was confident police would capture those responsible, officially described as criminal elements.</p>
<p>&quot;With the support of our police and the masses, we definitely have confidence,&quot; Jia said when asked if authorities believed they were near solving the case.</p>
<p>Jia and other officials did not refer to another bombing in Beijing earlier last week. That explosion caused no damage, according to the semi-official China News Service.</p>
<p>But the Beijing mayor said authorities in the capital had moved to tighten security.</p>
<p>Police have called on hotels in Beijing to strengthen security procedures, hotel officials said.</p>
<p>Police held an emergency meeting with hotel management and security officials on Saturday and asked them to be alert for suspicious people or packages left unattended.</p>
<p>Executives at other hotels in Beijing said police had called security meetings before but the bombings had clearly created concerns over potential threats to foreign and Chinese tourists.</p>
<p>Taxi drivers in Beijing also said they had been asked not to give rides to suspicious looking people from Xinjiang and to be especially cautious in neighbourhoods where many Uighur migrants live.</p>
<p>A post and telecommunication official said post offices had stepped up checks for possible parcel bombs.</p>
