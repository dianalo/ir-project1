<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Stocks jumped as investors shook off worries about interest rates, encouraged by the strong bond market and the latest surge on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 index rose 32.1 points to 3,958.2, leaving it up 47.4 points for the week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares set another record, with the DAX-30 index rising 18.79 points to 2,795.80. The index added 55.97 points this week. In after-hours trading it stood at 2,800.60.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares also rallied with the blue-chip CAC-40 index up 22.15 points to 2,240.33, a gain of 35.13 on the week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares hit records for the second day in active trade. Dealers said the firm dollar and short covering connected to the options and futures expiry on Soffex drove the market higher. The Broad SPI closed up 23.10 to 2,486.73, a gain of 47.07 from a week ago.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed lower, shedding gains posted early in the morning, brokers said. They said an unclear market direction, thin trade and position squaring ahead of the weekend weighed on prices in the afternoon. The 225-share Nikkei average fell 101.31 points to 20,929.73, for a loss of 271.31 on the week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks snapped a five-day winning streak to end sharply lower, as investors locked in profits after a week of record highs. The Hang Seng index fell 115.43 points to 12,889.37. It was up 138.21 from a week ago.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares set a record with the market inspired by the remarkable rise of the Dow Jones industrials, which closed on Thursday above the 6300 level for the first time. The All Ordinaries index added 24.8 points to 2,387.3, for a rise of 25.2 since last week.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - A late push by a strong industrial index ensured South African stocks finished mostly higher. Gold stocks weakened on a drop in bullion prices. The industrial index jumped 68.1 points to 8,048.3, a gain of 56.5 on the week, the all-share index rose 26.5 points to 6,842.7, up 49.2 since last Friday. The gold index fell 22.7 points to 1,720.9, but was up 39.9 from a week ago.</p>
