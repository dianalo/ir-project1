<p>China's customs authorities aim to boost tax revenues by improving the evaluation of prices of imports and exports, the China Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Customs authorities around the country need to improve their export and import price assessment system to prevent loss of revenues because of underestimated prices,&quot; the newspaper quoted Qian Guanlin, director of the General Administration of Customs, as saying.</p>
<p>More accurate estimates of the value of imported and exported goods would help authorities calculate the proper amount of tariffs to be charged, Qian said.</p>
<p>He did not say what specific measures would be adopted.</p>
<p>Customs authorities would also start auditing the prices of goods imported by the processing industry for export but that are sold within China instead, Qian said.</p>
<p>The audit would also cover tariff-free imports by foreign-funded enterprises, he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Some firms involved in the processing trade would soon be allowed to set up bonded warehouses to store materials for their own use, he said.</p>
<p>Customs had chosen a pilot group of 18 high-technology firms to have customs officials assigned to them, he said.  </p>
<p>Customs authorities would also try to crack down on smuggling by targeting a growing number of gangs, he said.</p>
<p>Customs officials had uncovered 6,130 smuggling cases involving goods worth 9.68 billion ($1.17 billion) in 1996, he said.</p>
