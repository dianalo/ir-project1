<p>The Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) 20-share index ssaw the rapid bullish tone of the past two weeks fade on Wednesday as investors offloaded shares into the market to cash in on the high prices.</p>
<p>Market players had said the surge in prices seen over the last two weeks was unsustainable as the demand was unreal.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of this demand was from speculators who after seeing such unimaginable prices bought shares to gain as little as 10 shillings then jumped out of the market,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>The index gained 3.81 points to close at 3675.44. Turnover was posted at 19.170 million shillings on 395,142 shares from 30.266 million shillings on 672,106 shares.</p>
<p>Prices on key shares eased marginally. Barclays Bank shed 3.0 to 125 while Standard Chartered Bank eased to 59 from 60. British American Tobacco Kenya shed 1.0 to close at 84.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a lot of small investors, actually speculators who've been trading in the hope that the price will continue rising,&quot; a senior broker said.</p>
<p>Another broker said investors stood to benefit on shares with foreign demand as it moved their prices upwards.</p>
<p>Foreigners bought 22,500 shares of Kenya Commercial Bank at 87-89.50 from 87, 4,700 shares of Firestone at 30 unchanged and 10,900 shares of Sasini Tea &amp; Coffee at 75 unchanged.</p>
<p>Oil concern Total Kenya edged 1.50 to close at 98.50 while power monopoly Kenya Power &amp; Lighting was unchanged at 294.</p>
