<p>Japanese rubber futures markets are expected to be steady and to move within a limited range this week as the yen's weaker trend against the dollar should provide support, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>But activity will continue to be dull, with any price gains capped by fragile physical demand in rubber-producing countries, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading this week is likely to be more of the same as last week, moving in tandem with the currency market. With no influential incentives, rubber futures should hover in a limited range,&quot; an analyst at a commodity broker said.</p>
<p>The most-active TOCOM benchmark August contract ended the morning session at 154.5 yen per kg, against Friday's close of 151.5 yen.</p>
<p>Similarly, the benchmark August contract on the Kobe Rubber Exchange was quoted at 154.2 yen, compared with 151.8 yen on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said slack physical demand in rubber-producing countries would undermine market sentiment.</p>
<p>They said the Thai government appeared ready to buy benchmark RSS3 grade rubber at 27.50 baht per kg, but added that any impact from the expected intervention would be muted.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though overseas markets have entered a season when rubber output falls, Thai rubber offer prices to Japan have not risen sharply,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;That shows that physical demand in producing countries remains weak. So if the Thai government intervenues in the market to prop up prices, that will not be enough to significantly push up prices,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The offer price for Thai rubber to Japan was quoted at $1.24 per kg as of Monday, little changed from last Friday.</p>
<p>Open interest in rubber futures has been on a downward trend reflecting a lack of speculative interest in rubber futures markets.</p>
<p>TOCOM open interest of rubber futures totalled 163,479 lots as of March 7, down from 189,799 lots on January 7, TOCOM said.</p>
<p>In the local physical market, benchmark Thai rubber for large-lot end users was quoted at 164 yen per kg on Monday, against 162 yen as of March 3.</p>
