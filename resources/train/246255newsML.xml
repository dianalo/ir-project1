<p>Aiming to counter lobbying by sceptical Western-based aid groups, the World Trade Organisation insisted on Tuesday that the poorest nations stood to reap major benefit from the freeing of global commerce.</p>
<p>But WTO officials also admitted Director-General Renato Ruggiero had failed to convince richer members, both industrialised and emerging economies, to remove all tariffs and other barriers affecting goods from the laggard states.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a lot of talk about the least-developed countries (LDCs) being net losers in this (free trade) process. The reality is very different,&quot; WTO chief economist Richard Blackhurst told a news briefing.</p>
<p>The briefing, on the second day of the fledgling body's first Ministerial Conference, was called to present a new paper backing that argument.</p>
<p>In question-and-answer form, the paper asked what the 48 LDCs -- mainly in Africa but also dotted around Asia and the Pacific -- really gained from the 1986-93 Uruguay Round negotiations that created the WTO.</p>
<p>&quot;A stronger rule-based system, more power when the WTO handles disputes, a strengthened hand in introducing domestic reforms, special provisions for developing countries in the WTO agreements,&quot; it replied.</p>
<p>Was it true that overall the LDCs, obliged under the accords to slowly open their shaky domestic markets to products from the big trading powers and richer emerging economies, stood to slip deeper and deeper into poverty as a result?</p>
<p>&quot;The claim simply does not stand up under close examination,&quot; retorted the paper, compiled by Blackhurst and Development Division analysts at WTO headquarters in Geneva.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, from some points of view these countries could end up among the principal gainers from the Uruguay Round&quot; it said.</p>
<p>However, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told a later briefing that Ruggiero, who had made help for the LDCs a personal aim in Singapore, had found no consensus on his &quot;zero tariff&quot; plan for them by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of members won't come on board, not all of them developed countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials at the conference from LDCs -- 29 of whom are already in the 128-member WTO with most of the rest waiting to be admitted -- have generally accepted that the liberalisation of world trade should work in their favour.</p>
<p>The Uruguay Round agreement, signed in Marrakesh in 1994, &quot;represents a balance of interests between developed and developing countries,&quot; Zimbabwe's industry and commerce minister N.M. Shamuyarira told the gathering on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Western aid organisations specialising in development issues have been vocally arguing just the opposite.</p>
<p>&quot;No firm action has been taken to avoid marginalisation of LDCs in the current trade regime,&quot; said a paper circulated among delegates and journalists by the Dutch-based TransNational Institute (TNI).</p>
<p>&quot;Trade is being put before people,&quot; it said. &quot;What WTO measures guarantee full employment, raising living standards of living and food security?&quot; TNI demanded.</p>
<p>The British-based Christian Aid group in a statement of its own in Singapore said that, WTO arguments notwithstanding, the Round had not created a level playing field for rich and poor to trade fairly.</p>
