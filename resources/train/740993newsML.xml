<p>After a nine-year search for his daughter's killers, John Ward is convinced Kenyan police have found the men who murdered &quot;safari girl&quot; Julie Ward.</p>
<p>&quot;I am totally convinced that these two men killed my daughter,&quot; Ward told the Sunday Times after the arrest of a police officer and a ranger.</p>
<p>Ward said both will be named in a police report which will recommend that they are charged with her murder. Both deny killing Julie Ward, 28, in the Masai Mara Game Reserve where she had been studying wildlife.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week I was sitting just a few feet away from one of them and it was a strange sensation after all this time,&quot; Ward said after flying back from Nairobi.</p>
<p>He has spent the past three months working with a small team of Kenyan police reinvestigating the murder.</p>
<p>The two suspects were questioned for two weeks. Both have since been released.</p>
<p>Ward said: &quot;I now want the men who murdered my daughter tried and convicted. That is what it has all been about for nine years, nothing more, nothing less.&quot;</p>
