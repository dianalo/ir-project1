<p>Two outside counsels recommended Tuesday they be allowed to conduct a limited investigation of charges of fraudulent voting in last year's Senate race in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Democrat Mary Landrieu was declared winner of the Nov. 5 election by 5,788 votes, but her Republican challenger, Louis &quot;Woody&quot; Jenkins, claimed she won because of fraud.</p>
<p>Landrieu, the daughter of former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu, was sworn in Jan. 7 without prejudice, meaning she could be removed from office if fraud is proven.</p>
<p>The counsels, Washington attorneys Robert Bauer, a Democrat, and William Canfield, III, a Republican, were hired by the Senate Rules Committee to determine if a full investigation of the charges by Jenkins was justified.</p>
<p>They recommended dismissing four of Jenkins' charges but said three others were serious enough to warrant a limited investigation. The committee of nine Republicans and seven Democrats is expected to vote next week on whether to accept their recommendations or take other action.</p>
<p>Jenkins, at a Washington news conference, said he was pleased by the report. &quot;We welcome an investigation,&quot; he said, adding he hoped a new election would be ordered this year.</p>
<p>Landrieu scheduled a news conference for later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In their report to the committee, the counsels said, &quot;While counsel cannot conclude that the petitioner (Jenkins) has met the applicable burden at this stage in the process to justify a full investigation, they also cannot conclude that these claims are properly dismissed at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>They said they found &quot;certain specific claims of fraud justify a limited investigation focused on the ... question of whether there is substantial competent evidence of fraud to indicate a probability that the election was wrongly certified, and that a full investigation is required.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The claims subject to this investigation are: vote buying; multiple voting and registration and voting by ineligible persons,&quot; Bauer and Canfield said.</p>
<p>They recommended that claims by Jenkins of campaign finance and election law violations, mismatched voter signatures, election commissioner malfeasance and voter machine malfunction be dismissed.</p>
<p>&quot;Counsel notes that the petitioner does not allege, and the evidence as submitted does not suggest, any involvement in these alleged fraudulent activities by (Landrieu) or her campaign,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>They said a limited investigation would involve interviews with key witnesses such as campaign aides and a review of documentation for the claims submitted by Jenkins. They said they did not think they would need much more time to finish their work but would need subpoena power.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he believed the report exonerated Landrieu and dismissed most of the allegations made by Jenkins.</p>
