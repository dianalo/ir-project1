<title>AUSTRALIA: Qantas union to hold stopwork meetings.</title>
<headline>Qantas union to hold stopwork meetings.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian Services Union (ASU) said on Wednesday it would hold stopwork meetings today of members employed by Qantas Airways Ltd to consider the airline's plan to call tenders for some services at Perth, Melbourne, and Brisbane airports.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that stopwork meetings will be held at a number of airports causing some disruption of flights,&quot; the union said.</p>
<p>&quot;Members are also expected to authorise officials and delegates to coordinate an ongoing national campaign in support of the ASU claims,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Qantas said on Tuesday it was considering seeking tenders for some ground services at the three airports and would consult unions about its proposals.</p>
<p>It declined to detail its plans but said the process would begin on Friday with a series of advertisements.</p>
<p>The ASU has said about 1,000 of its members would be affected by the decision to tender for customer service and ramp services work.</p>
<p>It said the stopwork meetings were endorsed by ASU delegates who met earlier on Wednesday and called on Qantas to withdraw the advertisements ahead of negotations with the union.  </p>
<p>The dispute was considered earlier this week in a preliminary hearing before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</p>
<p>Qantas earlier this month said it would retrench 132 staff and 53 apprentices from its engineering and maintenance division in order to improve productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>The company is 25 percent owned by British Airways Plc.</p>
<p>Qantas chief executive James Strong is due to hold a news conference on Thursday afternoon to outline the company's prospects. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
