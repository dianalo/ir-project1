<p>AC Milan striker George Weah was handed a six-match ban by UEFA on Monday for head-butting Porto player Jorge Costa last month and breaking his nose.</p>
<p>Weah was originally suspended for one match pending a UEFA inquiry into the incident which happened in the players' tunnel after a Champions' League match in Portugal.  </p>
<p>UEFA hinted the sanctions against Weah would have been more severe but for the Liberian's normally exemplary conduct.</p>
<p>It said it had noted that Weah had been shown only three yellow cards in the past five years of UEFA competition and that he had won the Fair Play Award of FIFA, the sport's governing body.</p>
<p>It said Weah, who missed last week's Champions' League match in which AC Milan were knocked out of the European Cup by Norway's Rosenborg Trondheim, would be banned from the next five games for which Milan qualified.</p>
<p>UEFA said any appeal against its verdict had to be lodged by Thursday.</p>
