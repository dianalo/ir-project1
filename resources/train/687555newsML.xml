<p>U.S. T-bond futures have lost their foothold above 112-00 and further dips towards 110-14 can be expected as charts correct from overbought, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for a bit more choppy action,&quot; said Robin Wilkin, senior technical analyst at MCM YieldWatch.</p>
<p>&quot;In the near term I'm expecting a bit of sideways action and looking for a pullback down to initially 110-31...There is potential for it to come back as low as 110-14 over the next few days.&quot;</p>
<p>By 0905 GMT, September T-bonds were quoted 9/32 down on the day at 111-28 in automated trade.</p>
<p>Wilkin said 110-31 was a 38 percent retracement of the rally from 108-05 on May 27 to 112-24 on June 20. A 50 percent retracement of the same move gives 110-14.</p>
<p>The medium-term outlook was still positive, Wilkin said, as the market was expected to form a base around 110-31 and 110-14.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking at 112-24 as the short term top,&quot; he said, adding that the daily chart was still hovering at overbought. But gains above 112-12 would be hard fought.</p>
<p>The market has been drifting off since it hit a daily high of 112-24 on Friday.</p>
<p>Gerry Celaya, a technical analyst at American Express Bank in London, said T-bonds may test support at 111-09, the June 6 high.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still quite bearish on T-bonds. If we can stay below 112-00 and get below 111-23, we could have a look at 111-17, the lows from June 17 and 18,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Celaya said any move to the upside would likely be capped around 112-03 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we're going to get much above 112-00 today...maybe up to 112-09, yesterday's high and if we get through that 112-24, the high from Friday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>September Eurodollar futures were 0.005 lower on the day at 94.135 and the December contract was down 0.005 at 93.935.</p>
