<p>The United States accused the Bosnian Serbs on Tuesday of committing a major violation of the Dayton peace accords by failing to report all the weapons they possessed.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the Republika Srpska -- the Bosnian Serb entity created by last November's Dayton pact -- had &quot;under-reported equipment holdings to an egregious degree.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dayton agreement, which ended the 43-month war in Bosnia, obliged rump Yugoslavia, Croatia and the factions in Bosnia to negotiate an arms control regime.</p>
<p>The arms accord, signed in Italy in June, limited the amount of weaponry each party could hold, with the Serbs reportedly having to scrap some 400 tanks and 1,000 artillery pieces.</p>
<p>But Burns said the Serbs &quot;have exempted hundreds of pieces of equipment through abuse of the counting rules and they have declared a reduction liability that, in fact, entails very few reductions on their part.&quot;</p>
<p>This meant, he said, that the Serbs were a &quot;major violator&quot; of the Dayton accords. The United States was attempting to make them abide by the agreement, he added.</p>
<p>Burns said he was unable to give precise details of the numbers or types of weapons involved.</p>
<p>He said Norwegian General Vigleik Eide, who is in charge of the arms control programme, had met several times recently with the Contact Group on Bosnia to ask for support in pressing the Republika Srpska to comply.</p>
<p>The Contact Group consists of officials of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia.</p>
