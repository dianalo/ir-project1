<p>Swedish yields ended higher on Friday and the crown was marginally weaker against the mark but gained ground against a falling dollar.</p>
<p>Yields came back up after an initial fall following an overnight fall in American yields. European markets shrugged off the fall in American yields and the Swedish market took its direction from a weak German market but underperformed and the spread widened four basis points to 95 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see higher yields and I think the ten year bond yield will tick up to around 6.90 percent in the week to come&quot;, one dealer said.  </p>
<p>He blamed negative sentiment on fears of a German rate hike as well as expectations of higher American yields. &quot;I think the German repo rate will be hiked in a month's time and I also see the American market bottoming out&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Bundesbank will meet on August 21 and the Federal Reserve will meet on August 19. The crown was marginally weaker against the mark but gained in strength against a falling dollar.</p>
<p>Weak performance of the Dow and fears of a German hike sent the dollar tumbling against the mark. &quot;Recent statements by the Bundesbank made people believe in a hike,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>The six month T-bill rate rose three basis points to 4.37 percent and the ten year bond yield climbed five basis points to 6.64 percent. The crown softened to 4.3650 crowns to the mark versus 4.3610 crowns on Thursday.</p>
