<p>The leader of South Africa's major black political opposition Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Sunday the country's Truth Commission, formed to bring peace and healing to the country after apartheid, was causing conflicts.</p>
<p>Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and home affairs minister in President Nelson Mandela's cabinet, told a rally on Sunday his party had lost faith in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) ability to heal the scars of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;The TRC has become a problem in itself which threatens the ongoing efforts aimed at bringing about peace and reconciliation,&quot; Buthelezi told about 2,000 people in this remote village west of the port city of Durban.</p>
<p>&quot;We have lost any confidence in the possibility that the TRC may bring about any real reconciliation to our country.&quot;</p>
<p>Neither he nor his party's leadership had authorised violence against their rivals in the African National Congress (ANC) during more than a decade of fighting between the factions in KwaZulu-Natal province, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This truth cannot be changed by any of the...efforts which are being mounted by the TRC,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Durban, the ANC unveiled a peace package which aims to end the violence.</p>
<p>The plan, which has been presented to the IFP, has the support of both Mandela and Buthelezi.</p>
<p>It proposes a special amnesty for perpetrators of violence in the province which flared after the April 1994 general election.</p>
<p>Nationally the cut-off date for amnesty applications is May 10, 1994 -- the date Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's first black president -- but the plan proposes an extension in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
<p>A special board elected by the Truth Commisison and comprising members of both the ANC and IFP would handle in confidence all confessions and disclosures of violence in the province.</p>
<p>But Truth Commission chairman and peace prize winner Desmond Tutu has expressed reservations about extending the amnesty date for KwaZulul-Natal.</p>
