<p>Ayala Land Inc's nine-month earnings reported on Monday were hailed by analysts who said it was in line with the consensus estimate for the whole-year of 4.256 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Ayala Land Inc reported its net profit surged by 34 percent to 3.27 billion pesos in the first three quarters compared with 2.43</p>
<p>billion pesos in the year-ago period. Revenues rose by 26 percent to 9.60 billion pesos compared with 7.60 billion pesos in the January to September period last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very much in line. No surprises,&quot; said Erwin Tan, research head of Abacus Securities who projected a net profit of 4.3 billion pesos for the entire year, 38 percent higher than the 1995 figure of 3.11 billion pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;It's actually in line or even higher than our 4.1 billion-peso forecast,&quot; said analyst Zharina Tirol of All Asia Securities Management Corp.</p>
<p>But some analysts said Ayala Land's third quarter performance actually showed a slowing down because most of its developed land had already been sold off.</p>
<p>The third quarter alone churned out a net profit of 730 million pesos compared to the average of 1.25 billion pesos each for the first two quarters. The third quarter is also a 4.7 percent decline from the year-ago quarter of 766 million pesos, analysts said.</p>
<p>Those concerns pulled down Ayala Land's Class B shares by 5.6 percent, or 1.50 pesos, to close at 25.50 pesos on Monday.</p>
<p>Some analysts, however, said that Ayala Land's performance should not be analysed on a quarter-on-quarter basis.</p>
<p>&quot;It has no seasonality. Its earnings depend on its projects which had been moved back in the fourth quarter so that the company can get better pricing,&quot; said Colbert Nocom, an analyst of ING Barings Securities.</p>
<p>He said Ayala Land had launched three high-rise projects in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Concerns that there could be a cooling down in the real estate sector had made investors take their profits in property stocks in the past two months.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very much concerned that high-rise residential and office buildings would experience a glut in late 1998,&quot; said All Asia's Tirol. But she said this segment of the business comprised only 28 percent of Ayala Land's revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;Among the property stocks, it's your safest bet. It is widely diversified into different fields,&quot; said Abacus's Tan.</p>
<p>Ayala Land B shares are currently trading at 34.4 times 1996 forecast earnings, a premium to the sector's 20 times. &quot;Ayala Land commands a premium,&quot; said Tan.</p>
<p>The firm, a part of the Ayala Corp conglomerate, reported residential, commercial and industrial lot sales made up the bulk or 38 percent of its revenues.</p>
<p>The next contributor was rental revenues which yielded 1.34 billion pesos, or 14 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Ayala Land also booked income in line with the progress of construction of its residential and office building projects, as well as from hotel operations and sales of house-and-lot packages. - Manila newsroom (632) 841-8937</p>
