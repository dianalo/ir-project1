<p>Pakistani police on Thursday shot dead six foreign Moslem guerrilla fighters holding out in an Afghan refugee camp near the northwestern town of Peshawar, police officials said.</p>
<p>They said four Arabs and probably two Tajiks were killed in a prolonged battle with the police, who stormed the compound at the large Jallozai camp where the radicals had been holed up.</p>
<p>The standoff began five days ago after they killed a comrade who fell out with them, and another person. They also killed a policeman on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police said most of the radicals were veterans of the Afghan guerrilla war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s, and belonged to the shadowy Takfiri group that regards Moslems who fall under the United States' influence as infidels and liable to be put to death.</p>
<p>The standoff at the Jallozai camp began when the group killed an Algerian fellow member, Mustapha Algazairee, after he refused to join their &quot;jihad&quot; (holy war) and decided to surrender to authorities, a witness said earlier. An Afghan refugee boy was also killed by a stray bullet.</p>
