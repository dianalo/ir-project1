<p>Congo's opposition is calling for creation of a multinational force to keep the peace during July's presidential election.</p>
<p>The opposition, in a 15-page statement signed by 18 parties this week, says such a force is necessary to avoid a repeat of bloody political and ethnic clashes in 1993.</p>
<p>The parties say that Congo may appear peaceful at the moment but that this is due to a truce &quot;beneath which the seeds of an explosion are patently manifest&quot;.</p>
<p>They also call for the creation of an independent electoral commission, multi-party access to state media and proper campaign funding. No date has been fixed for the poll.</p>
<p>Up to 10 candidates have announced plans to stand. They include President Pascal Lissouba and opposition leader Bernard Kolelas, runner-up in the last elections in 1992.</p>
<p>Former Marxist military ruler Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who returned in January after 17 months in France to an enthusiastic welcome from thousands of supporters, is also expected to stand.</p>
<p>The 18 parties want senior churchmen, judges and representatives of international authorities on the commission with the army and administration in an implementational role. The government, political parties and society at large should be represented as observers, they add.</p>
<p>Fighting among politically and ethnically based militias loyal to Congo's political rivals after disputed legislative elections in 1993 killed an estimated 2,000 people in Brazzaville's suburbs.</p>
