<p>U.S.-based Cyprus Amax Minerals Co's Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A. copper mine has received a $110 million long-term loan to refinance liabilities, a leading local bank said Tuesday. (Corrects source to bank from company.)</p>
<p>Banco de Credito said in a statement it led and structured the loan from several local and foreign banks.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in more than 20 years that international commercial banking has granted direct eight-year financing to a local firm,&quot; the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in more than 20 years that international commercial banking has granted direct eight-year financing to a local firm,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The loan is being granted by 15 local and foreign financial institutions and its granting is &quot;a clear indication of the resurgence of foreign banking interest in our country,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The loan will be granted in two tranches, the first for $80 million to be repaid over eight years and the remainder in a second tranche to be repaid over five years, it said. </p>
<p>The loan will be guaranteed using future copper sales of Cyprus' local unit and certain assets.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to refinance short-term obligations that went to finance the company's investment program.</p>
<p>Cyprus bought Cerro Verde in a privatization auction in 1994, when it bought a 91.65-percent stake in the firm and promised to invest $475 million over five years.</p>
<p>Cerro Verde is one of Peru's largest copper producers, accounting for nine percent of the country's annual output.</p>
