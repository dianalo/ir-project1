<p>Tehran's stock market is set for another buoyant performance this year as the exchange proves an attractive way for Iranian investors to escape high inflation and for firms to raise capital, its secretary-general said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Allahverdi Rajaei Salmassi also said the exchange would press the government for changes in rules that prevent potential international investors from repatriating earnings from their sold shares in hard currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of the shares will be 10-15 percent higher than inflation will be at the end of 1997,&quot; Salmassi told Reuters in his office at the exchange in central Tehran.</p>
<p>Iran's annual inflation is officially put at about 25 percent but unofficial estimates put it at up to 40 percent.</p>
<p>The Tehran Stock Exchange All Shares Price Index (TEPIX) -- which tracks the performance of all 224 listed shares -- set a blistering pace last year ending at 1,967 points, compared to 1,288 in 1995 and just 100 in 1990.</p>
<p>Market capitalisation stood at the end of 1996 at 29,556 billion rials ($9.9 billion at the official exchange rate), up from 16,010 billion in 1995 and 2,214 billion in 1991, exchange figures showed.</p>
<p>With state banks offering returns less than inflation, a clampdown on the black market in hard currency and a subdued housing market, the exchange has offered better prospects.</p>
<p>Eager buying pushed TEPIX to 2,120 late last year but some 3.3 billion shares in new issues, the appearance of additional investment companies offering shares and quicker computer-assisted settlement procedures has dented the index.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices on the Tehran Stock Exchange were continuously going up for nearly two years until three months ago...The market has become a little bit slowed,&quot; Salmassi said.</p>
<p>The government would continue to use the exchange this year to privatise state companies while government ministries would use &quot;participation certificates&quot; to raise finance for projects such as construction work, Salmassi said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many government bodies are planning to use participation certificates to finance projects and also many companies have applied to be listed on the stock exchange,&quot; Salmassi said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the best way (for firms) to finance their projects and to collect money in the easiest and cheapest way.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts describe &quot;participation certificates&quot; as a substitute for bonds which are prohibited under Iran's strict Islamic laws banning usury.</p>
<p>Fourteen additional firms have been conditionally approved to be listed on the exchange with two petrochemical firms, a copper producer and a steel mill company the most likely new candidates for listing.</p>
<p>Foreign investment in the exchange is put at only two to four percent of shares, primarily because of rules which stop outside investors from repatriating their earnings from share sales in hard currency.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the problem for foreign investors for the time being if they want to participate,&quot; Salmassi said.</p>
<p>&quot;This Central Bank regulation has brought us difficulties but the Tehran Stock Exchange is pushing ahead to find a solution...We are trying to solve this problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The Central Bank was not against foreign investment and was studying the problem of repatriation of earnings, he added.</p>
<p>Foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 percent of equity in Iranian firms.</p>
