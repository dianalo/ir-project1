<title>USA: U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- flat after jobs data.</title>
<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- flat after jobs data.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds were holding steady in early Friday action, despite an employment report for May that pushed Treasuries lower.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like there's a lot of strength,&quot; one trader said. &quot;But there's not much going on.&quot; She said the bid side might be off one or two basis points, &quot;but a lot of people are looking to buy on any weakness.&quot;</p>
<p>The headline job data numbers initially gave the markets a small boost, as May non-farm payrolls of 138,000 came in lower-than expected.</p>
<p>But the Labor Department said it revised the data for April sharply higher, to 323,000 from the original 142,000 report. That pushed some fixed income markets back into negative territory, analysts said.</p>
<p>Another negative for the market was the unemployment rate for May, which dropped to 4.8 percent from 4.9 percent. The rate hit its lowest level since 1973 and was below the five percent figure economists had predicted.</p>
<p>Following the data, the government long bond was down 13/32 at 96-12/32, pushing up the yield to 6.91 percent.</p>
<p>Debt futures were also lower, but muni futures are also outperforming. The September muni contract was down 2/32 at 116-6/32, while September T-bonds lost 12/32 to 109-20/32. The MOB spread widened to 210 ticks from 200 at the close Thursday.</p>
<p>Supply continues to be a key factor helping municipals outperforming, although next week's calendar shows a pickup. Preliminary data show $3.5 billion on the calendar, compared to $2.1 billion sold this week. Next week's total is the largest in about a month.</p>
<p>The negotiated calendar, at $1.9 billion, is led by a $540 million Puerto Rico Public Building Authority issue through Smith Barney Inc.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, Virginia Housing Development Authority's $225 million deal on Tuesday is the largest on a $1.6 billion slate. The competitive dollar total is the biggest since mid-March, and the 88 deals are the most in a single week so far this year.</p>
