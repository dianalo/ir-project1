<p>European bunker prices were slightly firmer on Wednesday with business in southern Europe calm after a bustling Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST fuel oil bunkers were quoted at around $93/$94 fob, about $1 higher than on Tuesday. The rise came despite the steadiness of the barge market. Some suppliers said buyers seemed more willing today than yesterday to pay standard premiums above the ex-wharf price with the suspicion that prices were about to rise again.</p>
<p>Total ARA demand was little more than 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were steady after sharp increases last week. Some short-term tightness persisted.</p>
<p>Mediterranean fuel oil bunkers rose by an average $1 a tonne in many areas to follow benchmark cargo gains, while gas oil was unchanged. Demand in most ports was back to normal after heavy activity on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Greek supply remained tight with problems at a refinery in the north of the country.</p>
