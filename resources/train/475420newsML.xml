<headline>Pope prays for Albania, Zaire at Easter vigil.</headline>
<dateline>VATICAN CITY 1997-03-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Pope John Paul prayed for peace and freedom in Albania and Zaire on Saturday night at an Easter vigil service in St Peter's Basilica.</p>
<p>During the solemn mass the 76-year-old Polish Pope baptised 10 adult converts to Catholicism.</p>
<p>&quot;Two of you come from Albania and two from Zaire, countries which are experiencing tragic moments in their history. May the Lord hear the cries of the poor and lead them on the path to peace and freedom,&quot; he said in his homily.</p>
<p>More than 13,000 Albanian refugees have fled to Italy in the last two weeks to escape the chaos in their country.</p>
<p>Zaire is on the verge of civil war as rebels have taken control of large parts of the vast country.</p>
<p>The Pope's Easter Vigil mass before more than 10,000 faithful in Christendom's largest church was the penultimate service in a hectic four days of Holy Week activities for the leader of the world's 960 million Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>The Pope, who has suffered a series of health problems in recent years, appeared to hold up well despite the full schedule.</p>
<p>On Sunday he will celebrate the most important day of the Christian liturgical calendar, when Christians commemorate Christ's resurrection three days after his crucifixion.</p>
<p>He will say an Easter Sunday mass in St Peter's Square and then deliver his twice-yearly &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; (to the city and the world) blessing and message.</p>
