<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds soften amid rumours of EMU postponement.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds soften amid rumours of EMU postponement.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Irish bonds softened in late trade on Friday in line with other peripheral European bond markets like Italy and Spain as investors switched interest to the preceived safety of bunds, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors had switched on the back of market rumours that Germany is to announce an official delay for EMU's start.</p>
<p>Comments from Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, who painted a gloomy picture of prospects for European monetary union if two key requirements -- a stable single currency and lasting budget restraint -- are not met, had also impacted upon markets, dealers added.</p>
<p>&quot;The big story of the day surrounds rumours that Germany wants to postpone EMU for a couple of years.&quot; The rumours, added to Tietmeyer comments, has had a huge impact on the markets, one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Peripheral markets like Italy and Spain are getting hammered and Ireland has been hit with them,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>By 1600 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down 50 pence from Thursday's close at 102.60 to yield 5.83 percent while the key benchmark bond due 2006 was down 55 pence from the close at 110.60 to yield 6.46 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said a close eye is likely to be kept on the U.S. next week amid talk of a rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Any numbers out of the U.S. next week will be looked at for any inflationary hints,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The perception is that Europe might be coming to the end of a bullish period. The turning point could come with a change in U.S. interest rates,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
