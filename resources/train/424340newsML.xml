<p>India and Pakistan are working to resume their stalled official-level talks on March 28 in New Delhi, diplomats said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there is a general indication about the date and place of the talks,&quot; an Indian diplomat told Reuters. &quot;We think the meeting could be held in New Delhi on March 28.&quot;  </p>
<p>Delhi's Asian Age newspaper said Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad would meet his Indian counterpart, Salman Haider, for three days of talks from March 28. Both are top civil servants.</p>
<p>The report was based on an interview with Pakistan's outgoing ambassador to India, Riaz Khokhar.</p>
<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, speaking to reporters in Mauritius, said the dates of the meeting between the foreign secretaries would be established in the next few days, the Press Trust of India said.</p>
<p>The last round of bilateral talks between the South Asian neighbours was held in January 1994 and bogged down in differences over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p>
