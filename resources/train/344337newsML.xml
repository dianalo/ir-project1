<p>The row between Bonn and the Church of Scientology reached new heights on Thursday when the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) blasted the church for comparing the party to the Nazis.</p>
<p>Bernd Protzner, general secretary of the conservative sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, called the Scientology statement &quot;the most despicable sort of offensive propaganda&quot;.</p>
<p>He said in a statement the church had insulted millions of CSU voters and its accusations marked a new low in a &quot;smear campaign&quot; against Germany.</p>
<p>The Church of Scientology on Wednesday accused the CSU of &quot;teutonic arrogance and insensitivity&quot; towards criticism in the United States that church members were discriminated against in Germany.</p>
<p>Rev. Heber Jentzsch, President of the Church of Scientology International, had said in Los Angeles the CSU's suggestion that the U.S. State Department had &quot;fallen for&quot; the Scientologists &quot;harkens back to Nazi accusations that then former President Roosevelt was surrounded by Jewish advisers who whispered tales of persecution in his ears&quot; in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The retort from the traditionally conservative CSU came shortly before the publication of a U.S. State Department report, which took issue with Germany for discriminating against the group in business and cultural life.</p>
<p>In its annual human rights report for 1996, the State Department said a &quot;sharp debate&quot; surrounded the activities in Germany of Scientology.</p>
<p>Bavaria has banned Scientology members from holding public office and this week called on the German government to take a tougher stance against the group.</p>
<p>&quot;While Protzner and (Bavarian) Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein wallow in rhetoric, basic human rights are being denied our parishoners in Germany,&quot; said Jentzsch.</p>
<p>&quot;CSU politicians think their egos are more important than the right of German citizens to provide for their families, send their children to school and live their lives free of government harassment and intimidation.&quot;</p>
<p>But Protzner accused Scientology of pressuring its members &quot;financially and psychologically&quot; and said the state had to protect its citizens from the organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The state has a duty to protect its citizens from these criminal underhand practices. The CSU and all German democrats will not be influenced by this slanderous rhetoric,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Protzner added the CSU would continue to make public its view that Scientology was &quot;a profitable organisation similar to the mafia, which aimed to undermine state structures&quot;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Church of Scientology in Germany, Georg Stoffel, called claims that the group had acted illegally &quot;pure propaganda&quot;.</p>
<p>Stoffel said such accusations ignored the fact that none of the many German investigations against the group in recent years had found it had done anything wrong.</p>
<p>He said Bavaria, which is largely Roman Catholic, felt particularly threatened by Scientology. &quot;In Bavaria there is no division between state and church and so the government feels that Scientology is a threat as a competing religion.&quot;</p>
<p>Scientology is a religious philosophy founded in 1954 by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Germany regards it not as a religion but an economic organisation exploiting its members.</p>
