<text>
<p>Ford Motor Co.  F Thursday posted a 4.7 percent U.S. light vehicle sales increase for June, the lone bright spot among a weak month for Detroit's Big Three automakers.</p>
<p>Gains in both passenger cars and light trucks, the category that contains sport utilities, pickup trucks and minivans, pushed the U.S. No. 2 automaker's total light vehicle sales to 357,741.</p>
<p>Car sales at Ford were 160,945, a 4.2 percent increase and the first time this year they came in above year-ago levels. Light trucks finished June with sales of 196,796, a 5.2 percent jump.</p>
<p>For the first half of 1997, Ford's car and light truck sales are down 1 percent, the best showing among the Big Three.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, General Motors Corp. posted a 13.5 percent drop in June light vehicle sales, dragging its first-half sales down 5.5 percent. Chrysler Corp. said its sales were off 4 percent in June and 6.7 percent in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p>Despite a soft June, Bob Rewey, group vice president of marketing, sales and service at Ford, said the automaker continues to believe the total market for the United States this year will stay in the mid-15 million unit range.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the economic and consumer data that we have seen suggests this sales level will continue in the second half of 1997,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
