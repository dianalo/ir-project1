<p>Philippine stocks took a further battering on Tuesday and market analysts said the short-term outlook was no more promising despite a host of strong economic indicators.</p>
<p>Since October 1, the Philippine Stock Exchange index has fallen by more than four percent, mainly on last quarter portfolio shuffling by foreign funds and on fears of an impending end to the current property boom.</p>
<p>Tuesday's fall of 83 points, or 2.7 percent, to 3,037 coming on relatively higher trading volumes led to predictions the downward trend would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazing at our crystal ball, we see darkness,&quot; Manila brokerage Anscor Hagedorn said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;That's how the market is right now: full of uncertainty, no clear direction in sight.&quot;</p>
<p>The fall came after the Philippines last Friday announced that inflation had fallen to a nine-year low of 4.4 percent in September, down from 7.9 percent in August.</p>
<p>Brokers said the selling, concentrated on the heavily capitalised property sector, was triggered by foreign funds.</p>
<p>&quot;They (foreign funds) are taking profits on the Philippines and moving it elsewhere,&quot; Raul Ruiz, vice-president for research at brokerage Sun Hung Kai Securities said.</p>
<p>Manila stocks had risen by over 20 percent since January while other markets in the region were depressed, &quot;which is why most fund managers are trying to book profits&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Foreign funds account for over 50 percent of daily volumes on the Manila stock market which average around 2.5 billion pesos ($95 million). But on Tuesday, the volume surged to nearly 3.0 billion pesos ($114 million).</p>
<p>&quot;With relatively high turnovers accompanying drops, technicals point to the continued drop in the index,&quot; brokerage BPI Securities said in its market report.</p>
<p>One broker said the biggest seller was the Hong Kong-based fund Jardine Fleming whose brokerage unit in Manila is by far the biggest on the Philippine Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Jardine in Hong Kong denied it was selling and said the fund was still overweight in Manila.</p>
<p>Brokerage Philippine Asia Equity Securities in its report on Tuesday said: &quot;The market was hugely down today as foreign fund managers continued to reduce their weightings on Asian markets including the Philippines.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock market picture has contrasted with the overall economic mood in the country with interest rates seen falling to a single digit by next year.</p>
<p>Yields on the Philippines' benchmark 91-day treasury bills have been falling continuously for the past few months. At the latest auction on Monday, the rate fell to 11.587 percent from 13.189 percent on May 7.</p>
<p>The lower interest rates coupled with a forecast by Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson of 7.0 to 7.5 percent gross national product (GNP) growth in 1996 had put together all the ingredients needed for a bull run.</p>
<p>First half GNP growth was at 7.06 percent against the year-ago 5.6 percent.</p>
