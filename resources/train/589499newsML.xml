<headline>Med oil products - strong crude boosts gasoline.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-16</dateline>

<p>Mediterranean oil products were mixed on Friday, with high sulphur fuel and gas oil weaker on good supply and gasoline firmed by strong crude, traders said.</p>
<p>Gas oil was slightly softer was material widely offered and buying interest subdued.</p>
<p>Premiums to benchmark quotes for 0.2 percent sulphur heating oil slipped to around +50 cents cif Genoa.</p>
<p>Russian material flowed freely out of the Black Sea ports with no disruptions to liftings except for the closure for maintenance of product berth three for maintenance.</p>
<p>Offers for EN590 also eased amid slack demand.</p>
<p>Gasoline remained firm amid healthy demand out of Italy and Eastern Europe and healthy crude prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I think prices are going to stay pretty firm into June and then maybe we'll see the market settle down a bit,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Naphtha was steady in a quiet market although traders saw demand growing as the market moved into June.</p>
<p>Fuel oil was steady, with bunker demand diminishing, a steady flow of Russian material and continued interest in working high sulphur material to the Far East.</p>
<p>A cargo of high sulphur straight run from Turkey was heard sold to an unknown buyer. Bids were heard to be higher than plus $3 but the final sale number was not immediately revealed.</p>
<p>Low sulphur fuel jumped on a notional basis on the back of stronger swap markets in northern Europe and a cargo deal of British barrels heard done at $95 fob, a $5 jump on the previous level.</p>
