<p>Bulgaria's newly-elected government will take a fresh look at a planned pipeline to bring Russian crude from the Black Sea to Northern Greece, a $800-million trans-Balkan project dogged by delays.</p>
<p>&quot;On the whole we are very positive but we are going to explore all the details of the project,&quot; Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadejda Mihailova told Reuters.</p>
<p>She said Bulgaria would re-examine the share distribution and participation of the private sector in the plan, a long disputed point between Greece and previous Bulgarian governments that has cast a shadow over the project.</p>
<p>Bulgaria had been uneasy in the past with the large participation of big private Greek construction companies in the project while Greece was eager to support its firms in exchange for some vital funding.</p>
<p>Mihailova said her government wanted to see the project through and had no objections in principle about private participation but wanted to put it back on the negotiating table and carefully go over details.</p>
<p>Greece has warned that other problems may surface while Bulgaria takes its time to review the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We are having difficulty with finding a steady flow of oil and it can't be viable if there is not enough oil,&quot; Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos told a news conference during a Balkan Foreign ministers meeting in this northern Greek city.</p>
<p>He said Greek financing could also be a problem if private investors don't agree with the final plan.</p>
<p>Russia, Greece and Bulgaria have agreed to build the 300-km (180 mile) high-pressure pipeline to bring crude oil from the Urals from Bulgaria's Black Sea port of Burgas to the northern Greek port of Alexandroupolis.</p>
<p>The pipeline, which would have a capacity of 600,000 barrels a day, is expected to boost the Bulgarian economy and Greek shipping. The oil, drilled in central Asia, will first be transported by tankers from Novorossiisk to Burgas.</p>
<p>The plan also calls for marine facilities 20 kms (12 miles) south of Burgas for unloading tankers and a tank farm with a capacity of 3.8 million barrels. Another tank farm with 7.5 million barrel capacity is planned near Alexandroupolis.</p>
<p>An initial agreement outlining the project was signed in September 1994, calling for completion of the plan by 1997.</p>
<p>Among the companies involved are the Russian oil and gas supply company Gazprom, the Greek Latsis Group and Kopelouzos Group, and Prometheus Gas SA, a joint venture between Kopelouzos and Gazprom.</p>
<p>The governments of Greece and Bulgaria will be minority shareholders, probably throught their state-owned oil companies, DEP and Chiminport.</p>
<p>The project will be designed, constructed and operated by a new international company set up for this purpose, Trans-Balkan Pipeline SA.</p>
