<title>UK: NWE gasoline firm as moderate NYMEX gains support.</title>
<headline>NWE gasoline firm as moderate NYMEX gains support.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gasoline was firm on Tuesday helped by moderate gains in the NYMEX unleaded contract, traders said.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges traded at $202.25 and $202.50 a tonne fob AR in early trade, while 2,000 tonnes of Eurograde material was bought by a U.K. player at $201 later.</p>
<p>Regular was quoted in a wide price band ranging $191.50/$196.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the larger than usual price spread between Eurograde and regular material to a dearth of interest in regular grade.</p>
<p>Others also attributed it to Eurograde quotes some $2 too high.</p>
<p>A number of players looked to move material to the United States. Traders are looking for a price differential between Rotterdam May barges and the June NYMEX of around $23 to make the arbitrage work.</p>
<p>Some said potential exporters would have to move promptly to make the trip work.</p>
<p>At around 1700 GMT the differential between May barges/June unleaded stood around $23.80, while between May barges/July unleaded it was just $20.</p>
<p>A Belgian refiner was reported to have sold a transatlantic cargo late on Tuesday, but this was not confirmed. Traders estimated a price around July NYMEX unleaded -$6.0. -- Melanie Goodfellow, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7714.</p>
