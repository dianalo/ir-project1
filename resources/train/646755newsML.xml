<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks end down, take rest from recent rally.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks end down, take rest from recent rally.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks broke with a record-breaking run on Monday and closed down on what dealers said was light profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;The market took profits at moderate volume while awaiting the outcome of (Tuesday's) primary Cetes auction. The consensus forecast is that rates will increase,&quot; said Roberto Galvan, an equity analyst with the Bursametrica consultancy.</p>
<p>Final closing prices placed the blue chip IPC share index down 34.55 points, or 0.83 percent, at 4,126.30. Trading volume was lackluster at 61.8 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nonetheless, from the volume we can see a tendency among investors to retain their positions,&quot; Galvan added.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is taking a breather,&quot; a desk trader said. &quot;Jitters over forthcoming elections were present, but it was time for every one to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico will hold elections on July 6 for the entire lower house of Congress, one-quarter of the Senate, mayor of Mexico City and several state governors.</p>
<p>Dealers said May inflation data released in late trade had little impact on the market.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced the Consumer Price Index rose by 0.91 percent in May. This compares with an average forecast increase of 0.92 percent in a previous Reuters forecast of ten Mexico City financial firms.</p>
<p>&quot;The (inflation) data had little effect as it was exactly in line with predictions,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Financial firm Bancomer weighed down most on the market. Dealers said forecast increases in primary rates, which tend to increase banks' past-due loans burdens, encouraged profit-taking on the B series after it had gained 18 percent last week.  </p>
<p>Bancomer's B shares slid 13 centavos to 3.37 pesos, while its A class shares ended off seven centavos 1.86 pesos.</p>
<p>Telecomms firm Telmex succumbed to profit-taking and decoupled its progress from the broad trend on Wall Street, dealers said. Telmex L shares ended down 18 centavos to 18.62 pesos, while its ADRs were off 1/8 at 46-7/8.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones meanwhile climbed 42.72 points to a new record close of 7,478.50.</p>
<p>&quot;A few exporters did well today because of the soft peso, like GCC and Alfa,&quot; a desk trader said.  </p>
<p>Cement maker Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua gained two centavos to 8.34 pesos, while industrial conglomerate Alfa rose 50 centavos to 48.50 pesos.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour pesos had closed earlier 0.25 of a centavo firmer, but weakened considerably last week.</p>
<p>The broad market matched the declines posted by blue chips. Of a total of 108 stocks traded, decliners outpaced gainers by 58 to 23.</p>
<p>Retailer Sears Roebuck de Mexico ended unchanged at 18.10 pesos after a hefty cross trade.  </p>
<p>Monday saw the deadline of a public offering undertaken by Grupo Carso to acquire an additional 25 percent of equity in Sears Mexico through Corporacion de Empresas Comerciales.</p>
<p>Carso had previously acquired a 60-percent stake in Sears Mexico at the beginning of April from Sears Roebuck Co., which now holds 15 percent of the Mexican chain.</p>
