<text>
<p>Danish bond prices continued to build on their earlier gains on Thursday, lifted intitially by Wednesday's U.S. advances, then boosted further by rises in German Bund futures.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a suprisingly positive market, but I imagine that we have reached the day's peak,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>At 1040 GMT the benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 was up 0.50 point from Wednesday's close, at 110.20, yielding 6.45 percent, in turnover of 1.8 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Its June future rose 0.50 point to 109.70, with 111 contracts traded.  </p>
<p>The six percent mortgage bond due 2026 gained 0.30 point to 88.15.</p>
<p>The crown traded unchanged at 3.8060 per mark.</p>
<p>The 10-year yield gap with Germany widened to 66 basis points, from Wednesday's 63 b.p.</p>
<p>The Central Bank was active on the market, selling around 700 million crowns worth of the 7 percent bond due 2024 and the 5 percent 2005 paper, as part of its routine financing operations. --Stig Pedersen, Copenhagen newsroom, 45-33-969659</p>
