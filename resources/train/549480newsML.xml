<p>President Bill Clinton said in a statement on Wednesday that the first-quarter U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) report showed strong economic growth with moderate inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have received positive news about the nation's economy -- more strong growth with moderate inflation,&quot; Clinton said in a statement, adding that it was &quot;imperative that we pass a bipartisan balanced budget agreement to continue this solid economic progress.&quot;  </p>
<p>U.S. economic growth swept ahead at its fastest pace in more than nine years during the first quarter this year, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, with GDP expanding at a surprising 5.6 percent annual rate.</p>
<p>That was a strong pickup from a 3.8 percent rate of growth in last year's final quarter.</p>
<p>Clinton attributed the strong growth in part to the fiscal tightening that his administration has put in place since coming into office in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;Our sound fiscal policies, together with the hard work of the American people, have sparked a remarkable period of economic expansion and job creation,&quot; he said. &quot;While it is still too early to know for certain, our economic policies and this year's healthy growth may help us cut the deficit for the fifth straight year -- for the first time in 50 years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, it's time to finish the job and balance the budget,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Administration officials are in the midst of talks with congressional negotiators about a plan to balance the budget over the five years to 2002, but have yet to strike a deal.</p>
