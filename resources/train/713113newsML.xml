<headline>Asia Naphtha/Mogas-Contango,East/West spread eases.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Naphtha prices recovered on Tuesday with the contango narrowing on shortcovering, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The contango is narrowing just because of some parties covering their short positions,&quot; a trader with a major oil company said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I would not call it bullishness .. more a recovery or an adjustment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Japan, the spread between September 1-15 and October 1-15 open-spec narrowed to -50/+50 cents per tonne.  </p>
<p>The contango between August and September Singapore naphtha swaps had also diasppeared and were talked at par at $20.60/$20.80 per barrel. July was still in contango at $20.55/$20.75.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know whether you would call it bullish news but the East/West spread is also narrower,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>He said the spread was currently around $22 per tonne compared to $30-$35 in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;But I can't find any reason for the market to go into a big backwardation,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>High stocks in North Asia dampened demand with only around three requirements heard for South Korea in the second-half August.</p>
<p>&quot;They can receive the naphtha but they don't definitely need it,&quot; a supplier said.</p>
<p>The only firm demand in the region was heard from Thailand for an aromatics plant.</p>
<p>The market rumoured a deal had been done at $2 below Japanese spot quotes on a c+f basis, but the parties had yet to conclude the deal for the July delivery cargo, sources said.  </p>
<p>Gasoline was similarly lacklustre ahead of tomorrow's close of Taiwan import reformate tender and Saudi Aramco's export reformate tender.</p>
<p>One trader said there was some interest in the Saudi cargo from traders with storage in the Mideast.</p>
<p>Unleaded 95-octane lifting August 3-7 was bid at $23.00 per barrel fob Singapore, but only faced a 92-octane unleaded seller at $22.50 for a cargo lifting July 26-30.  </p>
<p>(Prices are in dollars per barrel)</p>
