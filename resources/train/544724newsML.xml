<p>It's crunch time for Mercedes-Benz AG, whose cars have long been a symbol of the upper crust establishment, as it now seeks a new type of buyer -- youthful consumers with an anti-establishment streak.</p>
<p>The German luxury carmaker on Tuesday will roll out its new A-class compact car, a bid to lure customers at a younger age into the Mercedes brand and also to help expand the carmaker's sales to one million vehicles by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Mercedes knows very well it must revamp its image to attract buyers for the A-class -- aimed at 30-something singles, two-person households and hip young families -- in a difficult sales environment for the Stuttgart-based group.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly unconventional for Mercedes but the advertising strategy for this car has been unconventional and unique from the start,&quot; said Mercedes spokesman Roland Klein.</p>
<p>But the question still remains -- can Mercedes attract fickle young buyers to its product line with a car, which has strong fans among the automotive press for its design and safety features, that costs less than half its other models?</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't seem to be the Mercedes we know and love,&quot; said Peter Schmidt at consultant group Automotive Industry Data in England. &quot;The car is a completely different animal than the rest of the Mercedes product range.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is still to be debated whether the A-class is too much a move for Mercedes from one extreme to the other and whether it will alienate loyal but older customers,&quot; Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Mercedes' efforts, which have included millions of marks for marketing campaigns to build up a potential customer base of more than 300,000 names -- of which 100,000 are considered by Mercedes to be &quot;hot prospects&quot; -- have been rather striking.</p>
<p>An 18-metre high &quot;cosmic&quot; cube will be built on Frankfurt's famous Opernplatz for Tuesday's gala event to formally unveil the car, which was also shown at the Geneva car show in March, and begin a traveling road show around Germany and Europe.</p>
<p>Members of the Catalan theatre company La Fura dels Baus, (&quot;The Rats from the Sewer&quot;) and best known for &quot;terrorising&quot; audiences at a 1989 Sydney performance with chainsaws, shopping trolleys and offal, will be on hand at the Frankfurt event.</p>
<p>At the Geneva car show, stomping dancers unveiled the car as part of a fevered-pitch routine that included some using the car, to be priced at about 30,000 marks, as a percussion instrument in front of Daimler boss Juergen Schneider.</p>
<p>People responding to Mercedes' advertising campaign have also received a glitzy brochure with 20-something models reminiscent of a hip fashion catalogue that folds out to 3.6 meters long -- the same length as the compact vehicle.</p>
<p>The events have been a far cry from past gala openings at which champagne and appetizers were in good supply as Mercedes fought for well-heeled customers against rivals BMW AG and Audi, a unit of major carmaker Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>Now Mercedes, which spent $1.65 billion to design the A-class, also faces a tough fight from VW and General Motors Corp in a mass-market bid to broaden its luxury appeal.</p>
<p>Some experts wonder whether the A-class may be too much a departure from the existing Mercedes line, noting BMW and Audi have lower-end models that blend in well with existing product lines and do a good job of attracting buyers and keeping them.</p>
<p>&quot;People that opt to buy the A-class are a different class of people,&quot; said Bob Barber, an industry analyst at HSBC James Capel in London. &quot;They are not buying it necessarily because of the Mercedes label, which carries a pricing premium.&quot;</p>
<p>The car at first, anyway, will be viewed as a success by Mercedes due to the anticipated heavy demand for the vehicle, expcted to have annual sales of about 200,000 units, when it starts reaching customers in the coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;The first 12 months will look great, then we will see how demand works out,&quot; Barber said.</p>
