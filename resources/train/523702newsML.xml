<p>New Jersey Senate President Donald DiFrancesco on Monday cancelled a planned vote on a $2.75 billion bond deal which Gov. Christine Whitman proposed to pay off pension system debts.</p>
<p>DiFrancesco conceded the Senate didn't have enough votes to pass the measure now, but he said the bond plan is not dead yet.  </p>
<p>The senator, a Union County Republican, said the time had come &quot;perhaps to start looking at ... an alternative plan for the budget.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a difficult bill to pass,&quot; DiFrancesco said after a two-hour meeting of Republican senators, &quot;partly because we're utilizing some money to balance the budget.&quot;</p>
<p>DiFrancesco said the earliest another vote might be taken would be in early May.</p>
<p>The plan would enable Gov. Christie Whitman to balance her budget by avoiding $647 million in state payments to the pension funds.</p>
<p>Stymied by the opposition of organized labor, the administration agreed last week to reduce the borrowing to $2.75 billion. That will lessen the $647 million in relief to the governor's current budget proposal, but excess revenues will more than cover it, administration sources said.</p>
<p>Among the concessions Whitman made were to reduce pension contributions by state workers for two years, to find other state jobs for displaced workers, and to shelve her proposal to sell the state-owned temporary disability insurance plan.</p>
<p>Typical state employees, making $43,000, will save $215 each year.</p>
<p>As the Senate Republicans discussed the issue behind closed doors, union leaders were engaged in intense negotiations with the governor's staff.</p>
<p>Setting the scene for the showdown was Whitman's past success in bargaining with the more than 50,000 unionized state workers. She obtained a two-year wage freeze in July 1995 and increased the pension contribution of most workers. She also has reduced the work force by nearly 2,000 jobs and plans to eliminate another 2,000 jobs in the coming fiscal year, mostly by closing two state psychiatric hospitals.</p>
<p>Charles Wowkanech, president of the state AFL-CIO, said his members were busy lobbying legislators during the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still opposed,&quot; Wowkanech said. He said last week's agreement with the public worker unions &quot;didn't go far enough in protecting our workers aginst layoffs.&quot;</p>
