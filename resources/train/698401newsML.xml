<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.African stock market closing report.</title>
<headline>S.African stock market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The easing of foreign exchange controls on South African individuals on Tuesday was welcomed by shares, lifting the industrial index to a new closing high despite a tumble in Murray &amp; Roberts.</p>
<p>But niggling worries that the move, which allows individuals a once-off 200,000 rand offshore investment, may weaken the rand boosted rand-hedge stock Richemont to a 1997 best.</p>
<p>Analysts described the relaxation, which forms part of government's phased removal of exchange controls, as a non-event and in line with authorities' expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;Its been exceptionally quiet. A lot of enquiries but a non-event,&quot; Autrey Wilke, general manager of international treasury trading at Absa Bank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But dealers said caution was evident in the market and investors were seen adopting a wait-and-see attitude on Wednesday, eyeing the rand which earlier weakened over 1.5 cents although retracing back to overnight levels in late trade.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are just sitting on the sidelines to see first how much money will flow out,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Richemont added over three percent to 69.00 rand and pushed it to top the list of value traders by notching up 67 million rand's worth.</p>
<p>Engineering to construction firm Murray &amp; Roberts was one of the biggest losers, shedding 15 percent or 165 cents to a new year low of 900 cents after a profit warning.  </p>
<p>The industrial index headed north, notching up its second consecutive closing high, to end up 18.2 points at 8,808.7.</p>
<p>Dealers said stock gains later on Tuesday were also helped by a rally on the bond and share futures markets, which were both pleased by the recovery in the rand.</p>
<p>The industrial September futures contract was up over one hundred points in late trade to last trade at 8,680/88 from 8,579, lifting the all-share contract to 6,844/55 from 6,791.</p>
<p>Dealers said stock market turnover, which at the day's end was over 600 million rand, was boosted by large offshore trades in several shares by brokerage Smith Borkum Hare.</p>
<p>Dealers said the trades, in stocks including Rentsure, Omnia and Engen, appeared to be part of a programme deal with an offshore fund.</p>
<p>Gold shares overall added 3.6 points to 968.6, taking heart initially from the weaker rand and shrugging off bullion's fall to fresh 4 -1/4 year lows. The September gold future was firmer at 675/85 from 670.</p>
<p>Altogether the spot all-share index was hardly moved at 7,420.1, a gain of 0.1 of a point.</p>
<p>Declining issues outpaced advancers by 193 to 159 and new highs and lows were evenly matched at 31.</p>
<p>Among other features, Knights added five cents to 33 cents on talks about the formation of a new company which will buy Knights' assets were continuing.</p>
<p>Randgold, weighed recently by the poor gold price, a lower-than-expected listing for its resources unit in London and expectations of the worst gold mining quarter ever, added five percent or 100 cents to 21 rand.</p>
<p>Stantronic added eight cents to 124 cents on news it was in unspecified talks.</p>
