<title>MALAYSIA: RESEARCH ALERT-Public Bank recommended.</title>
<headline>RESEARCH ALERT-Public Bank recommended.</headline>

<p>Malaysian broker Thong &amp; Kay Hian said on Thursday it was recommending the local tranche of Public Bank Bhd's stock, and that its rating on the overall company remains a long-term buy.</p>
<p>In a research report, it noted that talk on Wednesday about the bank allowing foreign investors to buy its local tranche of stock caused the foreign stock component to drop and the local tranche to surge.</p>
<p>&quot;While maintaining (Public Bank) remains a Long Term Buy, we would limit our (recommendation) to the local stock component,&quot; Thong &amp; Kay Hian said.</p>
<p>It said the bank's local stock would benefit from a one-for- five rights issue price of 2.20 ringgit, against 3.30 for the foreign stock.</p>
<p>In a circular to shareholders dated May 26, Public Bank had said it planned to amend its shareholding rules concerning foreigners. Analysts interpreted the change to mean that Public Bank was allowing foreigners to hold more than the current 30 percent limit.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were selling the foreign tranche and buying the local shares, as the local shares were cheaper.</p>
<p>But Thong &amp; Kay Hian said in its report the changes were in line with new Malaysian Central Depository regulations that once a stock trades scripless, foreigners are allowed to buy local shares and vice versa.</p>
<p>All Malaysian stocks have been converted to electronic, paperless trading.</p>
<p>However, foreign shareholders who exceed the 30 percent limit would not be given voting rights on the local stocks they buy, Thong &amp; Kay Hian said.</p>
<p>The broker further said this regulation changes affects other companies with local and foreign tranches. If foreigners are allowed to buy local tranche stocks and vice versa, the differential between local and foreign stock quotations should narrow, it noted.</p>
<p>Public Bank officials could not be reached for comment. At midday on Thursday, its local tranche was unchanged at 3.56 ringgit while its Public Bank Foreign rose 10 cents to 4.02 ringgit.</p>
<p>Other stocks with separate local and foreign stock tranches are Arab-Malaysian Finance Bhd, Hock Hua Bank Bhd, Malaysian International Shipping Corp Bhd, Pacific Bank Bhd, Public Finance Bhd, Southern Bank Bhd and Tai Wah Garments Manufacturing Bhd.</p>
