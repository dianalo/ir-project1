<p>Defending champions Ajax Amsterdam were held to a 1-1 draw at home to De Graafschap Doetinchem in the Dutch first division on Sunday and trail leaders Feyenoord Rotterdam by eight points.</p>
<p>Feyenoord scored a 1-0 away win over Sparta Rotterdam in a local derby on Saturday to extend their lead to three points over PSV Eindhoven, who could manage no more than a goalless draw at home to Vitesse Arnhem the same day.</p>
<p>Ajax, who had never previously dropped home points to De Graafschap, have 11 points from seven matches and are seventh in the table.</p>
<p>Strikers Jari Litmanen and Nordin Wooter were the only Ajax players who showed any form ahead of Wednesday's European Cup Champions' League match against Grasshopper Zurich.</p>
<p>Litmanen opened the scoring in the 57th minute with a close-range shot after De Graafschap had failed to convert three big chances in the opening minutes of the second half.</p>
<p>After the Finn's goal the Graafschap attack, led by former Grasshopper players Ali Ibrahim and Eric Viscaal, failed to take full advantage of a vulnerable Ajax defence.</p>
<p>But in the 87th minute defender Erik Redeker scored a deserved equaliser when he headed past Ajax's international goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar after a corner.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the table Groningen still await their first win of the season. On Sunday they lost 2-1 at home to RKC Waalwijk, whose midfielder Alfred Schreuder scored the winner with a lob from just inside his own half.</p>
