<p>Hostages held by Peruvian leftists at the Japanese ambassador's house in Lima asked the rebels' leader for his autograph after hours of conversation, a freed hostage was quoted by Japanese media as saying on Monday.</p>
<p>Peru newspaper executive Manuel Higa, who was released on Friday, said that after long coversations, hostages eventually warmed up to Nestor Cerpa, commander of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) raid, Kyodo news agency reported.</p>
<p>Some of the nearly 50 hostages in the same room opened up to Cerpa after hours of discussion, asking for his autograph and telling him to take a rest, Higa was quoted as saying in a report from Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;He is an idealist,&quot; Higa said.</p>
<p>&quot;I could understand his point of view. I did not think it possible that he could kill me,&quot; Higa said of Cerpa, a former textile factory worker who uses the nom de guerre Comandante Huertas.</p>
<p>Cerpa, 43, is leading about 20 well-armed rebels who took the Japanese ambassador's mansion by assault during a cocktail party on Tuesday and initially held nearly 500 hostages. They demanded that Peru released jailed MRTA colleagues.</p>
<p>The rebels freed 225 hostages late on Monday, but showed no signs of giving into government demands that they lay down their arms and free the remaining 140 captives.</p>
<p>Cerpa is the only clandestine chief of the communist MRTA who has eluded capture by police.</p>
