<headline>Ukraine's Kuchma names new chief-of-staff.</headline>
<dateline>KIEV 1996-12-20</dateline>

<p>President Leonid Kuchma on Friday appointed Yevhen Kushnaryov, mayor of Ukraine's second biggest city, to head his administration, a presidential spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Kushnaryov, 45, will replace Dmytro Tabachnyk who was sacked 10 days ago.</p>
<p>Kushnaryov, mayor of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, is a senior member of the pro-presidential Peoples' Democratic Party, which mostly consists of top local officials.</p>
<p>Kuchma restructured his administration this week, making his chief-of-staff and four of his deputies report to him directly.</p>
<p>The move seemed designed to silence critics who said Tabachnyk had too much influence -- local media referred to him as &quot;the president's shadow&quot;.</p>
<p>Kuchma also subordinated four key ministers -- foreign, defence, interior and information -- directly to him instead of to Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko.</p>
<p>Kuchma's aides, seeking to justify the move, described him as the &quot;symbol of the nation&quot; and its &quot;highest judge&quot;.</p>
