<p>Bowing to stiff political pressure, Mexico on Sunday scrapped a four-year-old project to sell off 100 percent of its secondary petrochemical plants, and offered joint government-private sector ventures instead.</p>
<p>At a news conference, Energy Minister Jesus Reyes Heroles announced the cancellation of the first auction, launched in April, to sell the Cosoleacaque ammonia complex.</p>
<p>He laid out a timetable in which it would not be until the second half of next year that private investors get a new chance to buy a stake in a Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) plant.  </p>
<p>&quot;Responding to the points of view of very different organizations and sectors...the government has decided to redesign the strategy for developing the petrochemical industry,&quot; Reyes Heroles said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Pemex-Petrochemicals...will create various subsidiaries, as companies with majority State participation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said at least 51 percent of each subsidiary's stock would be government-owned &quot;A&quot; shares, and the other 49 percent &quot;B&quot; shares open to domestic and foreign investors.</p>
<p>In a bid to shore up the legal framework of the industry, it will also constitutionally define primary petrochemicals.  </p>
<p>Reyes Heroles said the government would ask Congress to write into Article 27 of the Constitution the eight petrochemicals it currently considers its exclusive right to develop, plus methane when it is derived from Mexican oil.</p>
<p>In his timetable, he said Pemex would be on a &quot;forced march&quot; to constitute some 10-15 subsidiaries that will be open for partnership. He aimed to have them set up by January 1.</p>
<p>Then, he said, there would be a minimum six-month period, in which potential investors would decide whether to take a minority stake alongside Pemex, or to invest in a new plant in which they would have the right to 100 percent ownership.  </p>
<p>He said it was not clear how the new &quot;B&quot; shares would be issued, but that potential partners would earn their stakes by investing in the expansion of existing plants.</p>
<p>Government investment in petrochemicals has been severely curtailed since the process to sell off the 61 existing plants began in 1992.</p>
<p>Also, since January 1995 when the current government of President Ernesto Zedillo sought to give the process a new push, private investment has been on hold. Reyes Heroles said there were some $5 billion in investments earmarked, waiting for the controversy over privatization to subside.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that since late 1995, the process had become &quot;extraordinarily politicized&quot; in a country where oil wealth is considered a national treasure.</p>
<p>Last month, Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) opposed the petrochemical privatization, and the Pemex union has also sought to block it, arguing that it was illegal.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the new rules would win acceptance from those two powerful groups.</p>
