<headline>FOCUS-French shares surge on relief at government.</headline>

<p>French shares bucked lacklustre conditions across much of Europe on Thursday, climbing nearly three percent as investors reacted with relief at the makeup of the new left-wing government.</p>
<p>The dollar softened, in contrast, with traders predicting a relatively quiet day ahead of key U.S. jobless data on Friday, which could point the way for American interest rates.</p>
<p>However, lingering concerns over European economic and monetary union (EMU) and Germany's budget problems were seen providing some support for the dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>Soaring platinum and palladium prices, prompted by a severe shortage of supplies following a halt to Russian exports, dominated precious metals trading.</p>
<p>Palladium fixed at $235.00 per ounce, its highest level since the twice-daily fix began in 1989 and its highest spot price since early 1980. Its sister metal platinum was fixed at $440, its highest point since September 15, 1995.</p>
<p>Most drama was in Paris, however, where the CAC-40 index surged more three percent percent to break the 2,700 points barrier.</p>
<p>Investors were reassured by the make-up of the government, with the appointment of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as Finance Minister seen posing no threat to monetary union.</p>
<p>By 1145 GMT the CAC-40 index was up 79 points to 2,715.</p>
<p>Among individual shares, Sanofi jumped 6.98 percent to 552 francs following Wednesday's bullish profit forecast.</p>
<p>German share traders said the market was relieved that a truce had emerged over the government's row with the Bundesbank over Bonn's efforts to plug a hole in its finances in order to qualify for monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;The important thing is that they seem to have found an amicable solution,&quot; said Josh Waiblinger, assistant vice president of equities at BHF-Bank, as the DAX index put on a modest 13 point gain.</p>
<p>Airline Deutsche Lufthansa hit a record high of 30.90 marks, a rise of 1.40 marks, with traders citing a positive U.S. research paper.</p>
<p>German and British shares were capped by Wall Street's weak overnight performance, which saw the Dow lose 42 points to 7,269.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index recovered most of its losses by mid-session after a morning overshadowed by the U.S. jobs data and the risk of a rise in British interest rates at the first meeting of the Bank of England's new monetary committee on Friday.</p>
<p>Profit-taking continued to weigh on banks, with Barclays down 10 pence at 11.60, yet British Airways was up 22p at 717.5 on fresh hopes for its planned U.S. alliance.</p>
<p>Government bonds, or gilts, firmed on an employer group's report showing retail sales growing at the slowest pace since October 1995. This also helped pull shares off their lows, although dealers said equities were in no hurry to push higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We are awaiting U.S. figures at the end of the week and the Bank of England meeting. Ahead of those events people are a bit cautious&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Back on the foreign exchange market, traders pushed the dollar down to near its session lows around 1.7240 marks but the market was holding its fire before Friday's U.S.jobs figures.</p>
<p>&quot;We're stuck in a range until payrolls,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen was down more than half a yen from Wednesday's European close, undermined by healthy trade surplus figures from Japan and Bank of Japan talk of pre-emptive monetary policy.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.7275 marks and 115.63 yen compared with 1.7310 marks and 116.23 yen in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1145 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 0.3 points, or 0.01 percent, at 4,556.8.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was up 79.66 points, or 3.02 percent, at 2,715.03.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was up 11.19 points, or 0.31 percent, at 3,673.03.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $340.70 vs $341.75 previously, while silver slipped three cents to $4.73. Platinum was testing resistance at $440.00 and palladium was trading $235.00 as the market awaited fresh news of Russia-Japan export talks.</p>
