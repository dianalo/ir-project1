<p>Despite expending considerable time and cost in the development of the wholesale power market, national grid operator Trans Power on Thursday reported a 2 percent rise in after-tax profit for the six months to December 31 to NZ$46.9 million, the New Zealand Press Association reported.  </p>
<p>The company, which will pay the government a $25.6 million interim dividend, achieved the result on a 3 percent revenue rise to $278.05 million.</p>
<p>Operating expenses were up 8 percent at $162 million, but finance costs were down 20 percent at $46.5 million. The company will pay tax of $22.7 million.</p>
<p>Trans Power chairman Doug Ritchie said operations related to the wholesale market had increased the company's revenues by $8.2 million and costs by $4.2 million respectively.  </p>
<p>Ritchie said total operating costs had been over-budget by $3.4 million, but controllable costs were $3.4 million below budget.</p>
<p>Finance costs had also been $14.2 million lower than expected, largely due to a one-off $11.5 million gain on leasing arrangements.</p>
<p>Depreciation, stock and asset write-offs and infrastructure services adjustments were up $8.5 million.</p>
<p>Ritchie said the company, despite declaring a one-year freeze on transmission prices, was on track to meet its earnings target for the year of $91 million after tax.  </p>
<p>Last week the company said a further $10 million in operations savings over the coming year would enable it to forgo the price rise.</p>
<p>System reliability was ahead of target for the period but the availability of the HVDC Cook Strait link was down at 95.9 percent from 96.7 percent in the year to June 30.</p>
<p>Availability of the high voltage AC network was 98.9 percent, from 98.6 percent, against a target of 98.5 percent.</p>
<p>A total of eight system minutes were lost through supply interruptions during the period, compared with 1.4 in the previous corresponding half-year.  </p>
<p>The company said three one-off events -- where an outage lasted more than one minute -- occurred during period compared with an average of two a year. Removing one-off events, 2.3 system minutes were lost.</p>
<p>At balance date Trans Power's total funds employed were up slightly at $2.986 billion, with $1.34 billion in equity.</p>
<p>Transmission line assets were worth $1.119 billion, down from $1.128 billion at June 30.</p>
