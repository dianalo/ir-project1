<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine High Court to settle phone rate dispute.</title>
<headline>Argentine High Court to settle phone rate dispute.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-02-26</dateline>

<p>Argentina's Supreme Court will settle a controversial telephone rate change introduced by presidential decree January 30, Prosecutor General Angel Aguero Iturbe said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Two lower courts had issued rulings previously on the telephone tariff issue, and today's statement from the Supreme Court cleared up where the heated topic will be finally determined.</p>
<p>The decree increased the cost of local calls and boosted telephone rentals by up to 41 percent, but cut rates for long-distance and international calls.  </p>
<p>Argentina's two telephone companies, Telefonica and Telecom, had waged a long lobbying campaign for the changes which they said would make charges fairer for provincial businesses.</p>
<p>They also hoped it would prepare them for the opening of the Argentine phone market to competition, possible at the end of 1997 but more likely in the year 2000.</p>
<p>But consumer groups and opposition parties decried the tariff hikes and argued Telecom and Telefonica would make windfall profits, which the companies emphatically denied.  </p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the government had appealed a Federal Capital judge's decision to suspend the rate hikes on local telephone calls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a judge in the central province of Cordoba ruled in favor of the changes and said his verdict was applicable to the entire country and could not be appealed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a state of uncertainty because the decree has been questioned in contradictory rulings by national courts,&quot; Aguero Iturbe said in a written statement Wednesday. &quot;(Going to the Supreme Court) is the best way to end this judicial uncertainty.&quot;</p>
