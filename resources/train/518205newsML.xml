<p>British bookmakers William Hill, owned by Brent Walker Group Plc, said on Thursday it had taken large bets on an election victory for the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p>&quot;After a week of almost exclusively Conservative betting during which time the odds were halved, we've begun to see a surge of support for Labour,&quot; said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.</p>
<p>The bookmakers said a punter in the south of England had staked 25,000 stg ($40,710) on Labour being the largest party in parliament after May Day elections. That would return a profit of 5,000 pounds, although deductions would cut that to 2,750 stg, the company said.</p>
<p>Another gambler has bet 16,800 pounds on a Labour win and 3,500 pounds on an overall majority.</p>
<p>William Hill offers odds of 1-4 on an overall majority for Tony Blair's Labour Party. At those odds, a four pounds stake would return a one pound profit if Labour won.</p>
<p>Labour are 2/11 to be the largest single party.</p>
<p>Last week, some opinion polls suggested the ruling Conservatives might be starting to close the gap on Labour. But this week, successive polls have put Labour between 17 and 21 points ahead, scotching ideas of a Tory resurgence.</p>
