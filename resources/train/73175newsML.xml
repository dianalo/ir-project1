<p>The two most powerful unions in France's SNCF state railroads raised the threat of a strike along with civil service unions on Oct. 17 after a meeting between a rail staff committee and SNCF management on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Communist-led CGT union said after the meeting it was proposing talks among rail workers and other unions on the possibility of a &quot;day of action&quot; on Oct. 17 amid concern over staff cuts and other worries about the SNCF's future.</p>
<p>Rail workers spearheaded a crippling 24-day strike and wider unrest late last year when the centre-right government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe proposed ending their early pension rights -- proposals which have since been scrapped.</p>
<p>The gripe this time, over programmed cuts in staffing levels and a modernisation plan which involves taking huge debts off the SNCF's hands, is harder to measure in terms of its potential to mobilise the railworkers themselves or wider public support.</p>
<p>Bruno Dalberto of the Socialist CFDT union said after the meeting on Tuesday that his union would decide after further internal talks on Wednesday whether to join a day of action on Oct. 17, and could well do so.</p>
<p>Dalberto, whose union has opposed a reform and debt relief plan for the SNCF since it was unveiled in June, said a one-day strike at the same time as civil service unions had always been on the cards as far as his union was concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;We had already said it was probable that we'd join the others in the civil service on Oct. 17,&quot; Dalberto said.</p>
