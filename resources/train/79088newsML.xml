<p>The European Union stayed off the world barley market this week but sent traders a signal it may hold out for higher prices before covering key Saudi business.</p>
<p>The EU's grain panel set an effective export price on barley, through tiny subsidised sales on Thursday, of some $141 to $142 per tonne fob Europe, grain traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts say that price is too high for the trade to cover recent sales to Saudi Arabia, and nearly all bids for barley subsidy at the EU's weekly grain tender were rejected.</p>
<p>Most of the 1.4 million tonnes or more of barley sold week was seen priced in the mid-$130s before freight and other costs.  </p>
<p>Traders expected the European Union would be eager to sell up to 800,000 tonnes or so of barley to grab the lion's share of the business and had bid at competitive prices accordingly.</p>
<p>The highest subsidy bid of 38.47 Ecus per tonne was worth little more than $127 per tonne fob for October free-market barley exports, traders said. The EU rejected most bids and held the line at roughly the same export price it had last week.</p>
<p>The EU grain panel in Brussels granted free-market exports of 5,000 tonnes of barley at 27.14 Ecus per tonne, equating to some $141 per tonne fob, and 8,307 tonnes of German intervention barley at 106.55 Ecus or $142 per tonne fob, traders said.  </p>
<p>The European Commission may still be uncomfortable with domestic prices, analysts suggested.</p>
<p>Despite wobbling on Thursday, these have stayed firm for most of the week that has passed since Saudi Arabia's snap purchase tender for 1.7 million tonnes between October and December was launched last week.</p>
<p>French Rouen-delivered barley was at 870 francs per tonne on Thursday, off the week's highs but well above the season's lows of 810 francs in mid-August.</p>
