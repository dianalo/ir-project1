<p>A package of fiscal policy measures aimed at boosting Slovakia's economy and improving the trade balance is unlikely to persuade the central bank to loosen its tight monetary policy, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Sergej Kozlik announced steps including scrapping a five billion crown bond issue to finance motorway construction and fixing budget allocations for specific projects.</p>
<p>The government also said it would follow the Czech Republic's lead in requiring importers of unspecified goods to deposit 20 percent of the value of their imports in non-interest bearing bank accounts in Slovakia for 180 days.</p>
<p>Kozlik forecast real GDP growth of around six percent this year, after growth of 6.9 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>But analyst Vladimir Kuklis of CSOB bank said it was too early to expect the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) to soften its tight monetary policy to pump more money into the economy, arguing that such &quot;shock therapy&quot; could endanger the stability of the currency.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be an error for the NBS and the ministry to congratulate each other on the state of monetary and budget development and immediately agree to soften monetary policy by, let's say, lowering minimum reserve requirements,&quot; said Kuklis.</p>
<p>This would lead to withdrawal of foreign funds which have flowed in, attracted by the high interest rate differential against hard currencies, and a depreciation of the crown.</p>
<p>The NBS said on Wednesday monetary criteria showed a positive trend in the first two months of the year, with M2 money supply aggregate -- its main yardstick for measuring monetary policy -- rising 13.9 percent year-on-year, compared with a 21 percent increase over the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>The finance ministry said it was pleased with a 1997 first quarter budget deficit which stood at 3.45 billion crowns, which was in line with its budget plans.</p>
<p>Martin Barto of ING Barings said he saw little room for a looser NBS monetary policy despite the positive M2 figure, saying the NBS should wait until the government cancelled some of its high-flying investment projects.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand the government scrapped its bond issue for motorway construction but on the other said it would seek other financing, showing it has no intention of cutting its budget expenditure planned for 1997,&quot; Barto said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there could be political presure on the NBS to soften its policy in the second half of this year when a larger budget deficit will have to be re-financed. A strict monetary policy could make it hard by keeping interbank rates at their current high levels,&quot; Barto warned.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget forecasts a deficit of 36.9 billion crowns, and the NBS has said some government investment projects will drain funds from the economy and make it expensive to refinance the deficit on the domestic market.</p>
<p>In reaction to the budget spending plans the NBS tightened its monetary policy at the beginning of this year creating an acute liquidity shortage to the interbank money market which pushed rates to levels of around 20 percent. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 421-7-521-8402</p>
