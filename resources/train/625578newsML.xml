<title>USA: Procter &amp; Gamble aims to double business.</title>
<headline>Procter &amp; Gamble aims to double business.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co Chairman John Pepper on Friday told analysts that the company plans to double its annual sales to $70 billion by 2006.</p>
<p>He said the company plans to achieve that goal with annual sales growth rates of seven percent, while maintaining earnings growth rates in the range of 11 percent to 14 percent.  </p>
<p>At a nearly three-hour New York analysts' meeting, Durk Jager, P&amp;G's president and chief operating officer, said the company plans to make restructuring a routine, ongoing part of the company's approach.</p>
<p>The costs associated with this approach would have no impact on earnings estimates, Jager said.</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble shares fell 3-3/8 to 133-1/8 in an overall stock market selloff Friday morning, but by early afternoon they were up 1-1/4 on the day, to 137-3/4.  </p>
<p>Pepper said that $7 billion or $8 billion of the projected sales growth would come in underdeveloped markets, such as Eastern Europe, South America and East Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are just scratching the surface of what's possible,&quot; he said.  &quot;The potential going forward is absolutely phenomenal.&quot;</p>
<p>Sales in China will pass the $1 billion mark this year, he added.</p>
<p>Other components of P&amp;G's growth strategy include building on its lead in its four top categories -- laundry, hair care, diapers and feminine hygiene.  The company sees adding another $10 billion in sales over the next decade in this area.</p>
<p>New businesses, such as food products with non-fat Olean, are expected to supply another $12 billion in added sales by 2006, Pepper said.</p>
<p>He said Procter &amp; Gamble also will consider more acquisitions, such as its proposed purchase of Tambrands Inc, now awaiting approval from Tambrands shareholders and various regulatory agencies.</p>
