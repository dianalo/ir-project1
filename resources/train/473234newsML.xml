<p>Note Bankers of America Inc on Wednesday said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Insurance Providers of America Inc and its Metro Acceptance Corp subsidiary.</p>
<p>The company in a statement said it would acquire the two in exchange for shares. It did not say how many shares it would exchange, and officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Insurance Providers is a non-standard auto insurance agency with about 19,000 customers and $17.7 million in annual sales, the company said. The company, which covers drivers that have been dropped by their preferred carriers, has two subsidiaries, one of them being Metro Acceptance.</p>
<p>Metro is an Arizona concern that finances insurance premiums, it said.</p>
<p>The company said the second subsidiary was IPA Financial Services. It did not say what would happen to that subsidiary once the deal was completed.</p>
