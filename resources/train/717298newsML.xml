<p>A Senate subcommittee Tuesday approved $6 million to support a controversial water project in southern Colorado.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration asked for the money to support preliminary work and ongoing talks to revise the long-delayed Animas-La Plata project, which is opposed by green groups and taxpayer advocates including House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, an Ohio Republican.</p>
<p>Critics have said Congress should reject any new money for the project because at least $8 million of $9 million approved last year has yet to be spent and plans to revise the project have yet to be studied.</p>
<p>The original proposal, which stemmed from a 1988 water rights settlement with Native American tribes, was expected to cost more than $740 million, including $500 million from the federal government.</p>
<p>The project was designed to pump water from the Animas River to a reservoir to channel it into the La Plata River in order to supply ranchers, industries, municipalities and Ute and Navajo tribes.</p>
<p>Local tribes on Tuesday announced a proposal to scale back the project, slashing its cost to $290 million including $260 million from the U.S. government, by dropping irrigation facilities for non-Indian farmers and ranchers from the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposal presents a realistic alternative that addresses the problems raised by critics yet resolves the issue of water usage in the region,&quot; Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate energy and water appropriations subcommittee said in a statement.</p>
<p>The administration had no immediate comment on the compromise that the Indians were due to present to White House officials later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not been provided a copy of the revised proposal, nor had any chance to conduct analysis on this scaled down proposal,&quot; said Paul Bledsoe, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.</p>
<p>Opponents of the original project called the new proposal a &quot;sleight of hand&quot; which would create a reservoir only slightly smaller than the original plan and would eventually seek to build more irrigation facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a way of getting a big project started by painting it as a small project,&quot; said Lori Potter, attorney for the Sierra Club and two other groups.</p>
<p>Babbitt last year set up negotiations, led by Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler, to resolve the controversy. Schoettler asked for supporters and opponents of the project to offer new proposals by July 31.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club aims to present its own proposal by the end of this month, Potter said.</p>
