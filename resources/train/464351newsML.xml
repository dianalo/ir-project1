<p>Austrian shares ended barely changed on Monday with investors largely sitting out the session, waiting to see the outcome of Tuesday's FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's basically in good condition. But nobody's really doing anything ahead of the decision from overseas,&quot; said one trader in reference to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting where he said U.S. central bank policymakers are widely expected to vote for an interest rate hike.</p>
<p>The ATX index fell 0.07 percent to 1,215.69 points after trading within tight range of 1,211.20 to 1,220.35. Of its 21 stocks, 11 advanced, nine fell, and one was unchanged.</p>
<p>Traders said trading volumes were generally low apart from turbulent activity in Vienna airport operator Flughafen Wien on market rumours, unconfirmed by the company, that one of the two chief executives had resigned.</p>
<p>Flughafen was the leading decliner and most actively traded stock, losing 2.49 percent to 549 schillings on turnover of more than 200,000 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the selling came above all from funds. &quot;It looks like a relatively large order on behalf of few customers,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The day's best performing ATX stock was fireproof materials maker Radex-Heraklith, gaining 1.91 percent to 426 schillings. Radex releases 1996 results on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The broad-based Vienna bourse index inched 0.06 percent higher to close at 456.39 points.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the April ATX contract lost two points to 1,214 on turnover of 632 lots.</p>
