<p>Denmark and Finland edged closer on Wednesday to an EU deal to phase out limits on the amount of alcohol people can bring home from abroad, but Sweden refused to move on the sensitive issue and said it was ready to defend itself in court.</p>
<p>The European Commission said it was willing to extend the deadline for Nordic countries to end special quotas on the amount of alcohol and tobacco people may import from elsewhere in the 15-nation bloc until June 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the furthest we can in hoping to reach a consensus among member states,&quot; European Union Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti told reporters.</p>
<p>Monti said it was up to the Nordic nations how to phase out their special rules but insisted a date must be set.</p>
<p>He was speaking after a meeting with Swedish Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Ostros, Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto and Danish Economy Minister Marianne Jelved in Strasbourg, France.</p>
<p>While Jelved and Niinisto told reporters they could accept a deadline for ending alcohol import restrictions, Ostros struck a defiant note.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have a joint Nordic position anymore,&quot; Ostros said in telephone interview.</p>
<p>It is politically sensitive for the Nordic states which have a traditional policy of high taxes on alcohol as part of efforts to reduce excessive drinking.</p>
<p>The European Commission wants these restrictions scrapped because they go against the rules of the bloc's single market in which goods are supposed to flow freely.</p>
<p>But Ostros said it was an &quot;immensely important social policy issue in Sweden&quot; and that Stockholm would not accept a final date for ending its restrictions. &quot;We are prepared to let this issue be settled by the EU court,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Jelved and Niinisto said their countries may start easing restrictions next year.</p>
<p>The EU executive said Nordic exemptions to EU rules, which allow them to restrict alcohol imports, were due to expire by the end of 1996 unless there was a new agreement.</p>
<p>Any deal between the EU executive and the three nations on the issue must be approved unanimously by the bloc's member states. The issue will be discussed by EU finance ministers on November 11.</p>
<p>Lifting the restrictions would also have fiscal implications. Alcohol and tobacco taxes bring in about $2.7 billion annually in Sweden and $2.17 billion in Finland.</p>
<p>A compromise leading to a phasing out of the restrictions would gradually allow Swedes, Finns and Danes to take home more alcohol while at the same giving the three states time to prepare for the new rules, the Commission says.</p>
<p>But as Nordic excise duties on alcohol are much higher than elsewhere in the EU, some fear individual alcohol imports would jump if the Nordics lost their right to restrict the flow.</p>
<p>Under current rules, a Swede is allowed to take home up to one litre of spirits, five litres of wine and 15 litres of beer compared with 10, 90 and 110 litres respectively for most other EU citizens.</p>
<p>A related problem for Finland is how to limit the amount of cheap alcohol Finns may bring home from nearby Russia and Estonia, both outside the 15-nation EU.</p>
