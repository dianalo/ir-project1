<p>White sugar futures managed to stave off some of the bearish spill-over from the New York market's slide and struggled to hold above earlier lows in light volume, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>With a mixed bag of players in London, the whites market took its cue from the raws where interest is expected to be centred before the upcoming March expiry.</p>
<p>The May/May white premium widened from Friday's close to around $67 but remained with the recent $65-68 range.</p>
<p>Broker-led arbitrage was also noted against the Paris May contract with London at par, traders said.</p>
<p>At 1646 GMT May was down $1.20 at $308.00 and August down $1.30 at $307.00. Volume amounted to just 763 lots.</p>
<p>In physical news, Iran's state-run GTC tendered to buy a cargo of white sugar for April shipment after buying a EU-origin cargo last week, again for April.</p>
<p>A strike by warehouse workers at Brazil's key port of Santos is thought to be affecting 90 percent of imports and a smaller percentage of exports.</p>
<p>Some 140 workers are involved in the strike over backpay, which began earlier on Monday and is set to continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>Values were weaker in Paris and the spot May contract was trading down $2.00 at $308.00, the same as its London equivalent. August was down $2.10 at $307.20.</p>
<p>Matif volume totalled 418 lots.</p>
