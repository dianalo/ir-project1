<p>Sinn Fein, political arm of the IRA, warned Irish nationalists on Saturday that they should be on the alert against attack by pro-British Loyalists after police defused a bomb under a leading Republican's car.</p>
<p>Security forces in Northern Ireland meanwhile continued a clampdown in an Irish nationalist stronghold of Belfast after making overnight arrests.</p>
<p>A Sinn Fein spokesman in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second city, said a &quot;suspect device&quot; had been found on the ground under the car of party official Liam Duffy at a Catholic housing estate in the largely Protestant Waterside area.</p>
<p>Police later confirmed it was a bomb. A spokesman said: &quot;Army experts have defused a device found under a car.&quot;</p>
<p>Police declined to say who they suspected of planting the device. &quot;It is a matter for investigation,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>The incident comes a week after Loyalist guerrillas were blamed for a car bomb that wounded a leading republican, Eddie Copeland. Protestant leaders close to the pro-British extremists denied the attack signalled the end of their two-year-old truce.</p>
<p>Senior Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness said pro-Irish Catholic nationalists and republicans should be &quot;extremly vigilant&quot; after Saturday's incident involving Duffy, the party's director of elections in Waterside.</p>
<p>The incident comes at a time of heightened tension after attacks by Irish Republican Army guerrillas opposed to British rule, and fears that a two-year-old ceasefire by pro-British Loyalist foes may be over.</p>
<p>The IRA resumed hostilites in a 27 year war on British rule last February after an 18 month truce.</p>
<p>Politicians across the sectarian divide say they believe Loyalist hardliners carried out last Sunday's attack even though the Combined Loyalist Military Command has maintained silence and figures close to the guerrillas say the ceasefire is intact.</p>
<p>Security forces continued their clampdown on Saturday afternoon in the Whiterock area in the west of Belfast, where soldiers and police sealed off a house.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of persons were taken into custody,&quot; a spokesman said, but declined to say if guerrilla weapons had been found. Residents said at least five people were arrested at the house.</p>
