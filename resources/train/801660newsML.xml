<p>Kenyan security forces, hunting the killers of six police officers, clashed with gunmen south of the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa on Friday and men armed with machetes killed four people.</p>
<p>Mombasa police chief Francis Gichuki said four people were killed by men armed with machetes south of Mombasa in two attacks on Thursday night and on Friday.</p>
<p>Friday's fighting broke out in thick bush near the village of Mutuga, 15 km (nine miles) south of Mombasa, during a major security sweep for attackers who killed 13 people including six policemen in a raid just to the north on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Armed police and men of the paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) stopped traffic moving on the main road from Mombasa to Tanzania for about an hour after gunmen were spotted. Gichuki said the Kenyan navy had also joined the manhunt.</p>
<p>He said a policeman went missing in action during clashes in the Kaya Mbombo area but he had no details.</p>
<p>Villagers earlier saw youths armed with police issue G-3 rifles which were apparently stolen in Wednesday's raid.</p>
<p>The Mombasa and Coast Tourist Association told hotels south of the port city on Friday to suspend their bus shuttles and tourists to stay on hotel property until security was restored.</p>
<p>The well-organised assailants on Wednesday burned down two police posts at Likoni in Mombasa, stole 30 police weapons, released Kenyan prisoners and killed several civilians.</p>
<p>The search operation involving hundreds of men stretched through a tourist haven from Mombasa to the Tanzanian border and was led by intelligence officers flown from the capital Nairobi.</p>
<p>Police said they had arrested a total of 36 people since Wednesday night's raid in which at least 30 people were wounded.</p>
<p>Kenyan newspapers reflected confusion among officials and witnesses over the precise identity of the attackers who were described as well-organised &quot;gangsters&quot; on a night-long rampage.</p>
<p>The attack was launched at a time of high political tension in Kenya ahead of a general election later this year.</p>
<p>In an editorial headlined &quot;What's behind this dastardly attack?&quot;, the independent Daily Nation newspaper ruled out common criminals and said the main aim was probably to seize arms and deliver the message they would kill in cold blood.</p>
<p>It said the Likoni raid was the trickiest security challenge for Kenya since ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley in 1992.</p>
<p>The attack began at 8.30 p.m. when the tourist police post at Likoni was hit. The post is at the landing point of the ferry from Mombasa Island, separated from Likoni by a sea channel.</p>
<p>Some witnesses said the attackers armed with machetes were local people taking reprisals against Likoni police for alleged brutality. They singled out Kenyan settlers from outside the coastal area before attacking them.</p>
<p>A witness said there appeared at least five groups behind Wednesday's attack. Newspapers said on Friday three policewomen were abducted by the raiders who fled south of Mombasa.</p>
<p>There were no reports of casualties among the thousands of foreign tourists in the area of Mombasa, which is on the Indian Ocean and is about 500 km (310 miles) southeast of Nairobi.</p>
<p>The last time the area saw serious violence was in December 1992 when the local Digo people attacked settlers from other tribes in a row over a Likoni quarry before a general election.</p>
