<p>Slovakia's 1996 foreign trade deficit widened again in September, but at a slower rate than in August, the Slovak Statistical Bureau (SUSR) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The deficit of 2.092 billion crowns ($67.55 million) in September narrowed from a 3.930 billion crown deficit in August, but imports mostly of cars, chemicals, metal products and aeroplanes swelled the cumulative 1996 shortfall.</p>
<p>The SUSR said the deficit for the first nine months widened to 37.17 billion crowns in current prices, from 35.078 billion for the January-August period. This compares with a trade surplus of 405 million crowns for the first nine months of 1995.</p>
<p>In a report, the SUSR said imports grew 24.9 percent in Septmeber versus the same month a year ago to 234 billion crowns, while exports were up by 4.9 percent to 197 billion.</p>
<p>The SUSR said about 39 billion crowns of imports comprised fossil fuels and mineral oils.</p>
<p>Imports for construction of the Mochovce nuclear power plant took up 35.9 billion crowns, while car imports totalled 21.1 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Metal and steel products imports totalled 7.521 billion crowns, while the imports of the airplanes took up 5.814 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;The import volume was mainly influenced by higher imports of motor vehicles, aeroplanes and ships ... compared with the same period of last year,&quot; the SUSR said.</p>
<p>&quot;In decline were imports of animal and vegetable fats and oils,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Car imports rose by 8.999 billion crowns during January- September, while imports of airplanes increased by 5.201 billion crowns, both compared with the same period of the last year, the SUSR said.</p>
<p>The single-month commodities import figures for September and August were not available.</p>
<p>The main export commodities were iron and rolled steel, accounting for 27.6 billion crowns in the nine month period.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic remained Slovakia's leading trading partner, accounting for 31.5 percent of total exports and 25.6 percent of imports.</p>
<p>Germany and Austria were next with a 20.8 and 6.1 percent share of total Slovak exports.</p>
<p>The second and third largest share of Slovakia's imports came from Russia and Germany, accounting for 18 and 14.5 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Trade with OECD countries produced a 10.535 billion crown deficit, while that with Russia was 35.421 billion in deficit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Slovakia had a surplus of 10.209 billion crowns with the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) countries.</p>
