<headline>INSTANT VIEW - UK jobs, earnings, retail sales data.</headline>

<p>Following is a selection of economists' reactions to data showing UK unemployment falling 68,200 in February, retail sales up 0.5 pct m/m and up 4.4 pct y/y and average earnings up 5.0 pct in January:</p>
<p>PHILIP SHAW, UNION PLC (RFTV) - &quot;We've had a huge jump in average earnings which suggests that there is quite a clear tightening occurring at the moment in the Labour market. Also the strength of retail sales -- that's a particular surprise given the weak survey evidence -- does suggest that there is a need for a modest tightening in monetary policy.&quot;  </p>
<p>ADRIAN SCHMIDT, ECONOMIST AT CHASE INVESTMENT BANK (RFTV) - &quot;The average earnings is much the most significant (number) although it is likely that the earnings figures are related to bonus payments in the financial sector round the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's uncertain whether this necessarily consequently justifies a tightening in policy. Five percent though, if that was to continues would certainly put on more pressure.&quot;  </p>
<p>BANK OF AMERICA ECONOMIST JEREMY HAYWARD - &quot;The UK data are not strong enough to trigger a pre-election rate hike, but the jump in earnings will boost speculation that a post-election tightening could be as large as 50 basis points.</p>
<p>There was always upside risk to the earnings figures due to bonus payments that did not appear in the December figure, itself revised up to 4.75 pecent.&quot;</p>
