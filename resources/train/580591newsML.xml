<p>A high-level group set up by the European Commission gave fresh hope on Tuesday of breaking a 20-year deadlock on draft EU corporate law which would allow firms to set up as European companies rather than national ones.</p>
<p>The EU executive published a report by a group of labour experts suggesting ways out of the impasse over the main stumbling block of worker involvement in firms' decisions.</p>
<p>EU heavyweights Germany and Britain have held conflicting views on this issue, blocking progress on the Commission's proposal for a European company statute intended to make life easier for industry and to slash administrative costs.</p>
<p>EU Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti welcomed the Davignon group's report, saying it was a &quot;key contribution to making a breakthrough on this project to which the Commission remains faithful after 25 years of difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first opportunity for years to break the deadlock,&quot; said EU Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn.</p>
<p>There is considerable pressure from industry for a European company statute, seen as a way to boost efficiency.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a significant factor in strengthening Europe's industry. We waste all over Europe too much money on administrative costs,&quot; Keith Richardson, secretary-general of the European Round Table of Industrialists, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The main conflict blocking a deal has involved provisions on worker participation in company decisions, with Bonn promoting its own system of &quot;co-determination&quot; between employees and managers and London arguing there should be no mandatory rules.</p>
<p>Seeking to resolve the row, the Davignon group, headed by Etienne Davignon, the chairman of Belgian holding company Societe Generale and a former European Commissioner, proposed that unions and employers should first try to agree on the worker involvement for each such European company.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only in the absence of an agreement between these parties that a set of reference rules would apply, covering both information/consultation and the participation of workers in the relevant company bodies,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>Flynn and Monti said the solutions suggested in the report formed a good basis for a fresh start of the debate.</p>
<p>&quot;They are designed to meet the concerns of all the interested parties, by opening up the prospect of a new option for companies and a legal framework to cover their European operations, while maintaining an important social dimension.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not clear whether Britain's new Labour government, which has said it will join up to the EU's Social Chapter, would change London's position on the issue. &quot;The new government has not yet considered the proposal,&quot; an official said.</p>
<p>Monti and Flynn set up the Davignon group last November.</p>
<p>The report will be presented to the European Commission on Wednesday, to EU Internal Market Ministers on May 21 and to EU Social Affairs Ministers on June 12.</p>
<p>A European company statute would provide for the creation of a 'European company' operating on a Europe-wide basis and subject to a single EU law applicable in all 15 member states.</p>
<p>Businesses established in more than one member state would not need to set up a complex network of subsidiaries governed by different national laws, allowing for major savings in costs.</p>
<p>Under the proposal by the EU executive, a European company could be formed in different ways, for example through a merger between at least two companies from two or more member states, or by companies from two EU countries or more forming a holding company or a subsidiary. -- Brussels newsroom +32 2 287 68 11</p>
