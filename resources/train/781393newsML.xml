<p>Poland must substantially increase its savings rate by reducing public spending in the coming years, the World Bank said in a report.</p>
<p>It said that was a condition for Poland to remain on a sustainable growth track leading towards European Union entry.</p>
<p>In a report &quot;Poland: Reform and Growth on the Road to the EU,&quot; the bank said that at the core of its proposals for economic growth with gradually declining inflation was the strengthening of public finances through spending cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposed reforms aim to increase public savings by 4.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and reduce the current public expenditures by more than six percentage points of GDP,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It said Poland could lower public spending by reforming its pension system, privatising and restructuring enterprises and banks and introducing reforms to increase private sector and foreign participation in infrastructure development.</p>
<p>The World Bank said Poland must shore up its banking and insurance supervision to help reduce the potential fragility of its banking sector when it opens up to EU competition.</p>
<p>&quot;The leading rural bank (BGZ), the housing and savings bank (PKO BP) and the national insurance company (PZU) will need to be restructured in order for Poland to compete in the European financial markets and reduce the burden on its budget.&quot;</p>
<p>The World Bank also said Poland needed to accelerate the privatisation of its coal, steel and chemicals industries.</p>
<p>It also said that Poland should quickly introduce regional development policies to cut high unemployment levels in certain areas and improve labour mobility while further decentralising responsibility between local and regional government.</p>
<p>In the area of environmental protection, the World Bank said Poland should focus on establishing institutions needed to implement EU standards, building credible enforcement and administration systems and enhancing public participation.</p>
