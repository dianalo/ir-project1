<p>Centrum Industries Inc said Thursday its goal is annual consolidated revenue growth of 20 percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p>The Toldedo-based holding company recently completed its acquisition of Taylor Forge International Inc, a maker of steel seamless rings, and said it is considering several other acquisitions.  </p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition of Taylor Forge, now operating as a subsidiary of McInnes Steel, was a continuation of our strategy of acquiring businesses that complement our existing segments,&quot; the company said. &quot;That acquisition substantially increased our market coverage in the seamless rolled rings industry, and that is the type of benefit we will seek from future acquisitions. We have several we are considering.&quot;</p>
<p>Centrum Industries has three primary segments: a metal-forming segment, a segment that designs and makes material handling systems for warehouse and distribution facilities, and a segment that makes equipment for producing high-volume fractional-horsepower electric motors.</p>
<p>&quot;During fiscal 1998, our goal continues to be operating margins greater than 8 percent at the manufacturing segments. Our overall target is annual consolidated revenue growth of 20 percent to 30 percent through acquisitions and increased market penetration by our existing businesses,&quot; a company statement said.</p>
