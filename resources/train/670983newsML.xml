<p>C-TEC Corp said Wednesday it has won Internal Revenue Service approval for the tax-free spin-off of two existing segments to form three separate, publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The company also said it suspending discussions on the acquisition of Mercom Inc until after completion of the spin-offs and restructuring.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, each shareholder of C-TEC Corp will receive shares in each of the two new companies, it said. It is anticipated all three companies will trade on Nasdaq.  </p>
<p>C-TEC said the new companies will be:</p>
<p>-- RCN Corp (proposed ticker symbol RCNC), which will consist of RCN Telecom Services; C-TEC's current cable television operations in the Boston-Washington, D.C., corridor; and the company's investment in Mexico's Megacable SA do CV.</p>
<p>-- Commonwealth Telephone Enterprises Inc (proposed ticker symbol CTCO), which will consist of the company's local telephone operations in Pennsylvania and related businesses in Pennsylvania.  </p>
<p>-- Cable Michigan Inc (proposed ticker symbol CABL), which will consist of the company's traditional cable television operations in Michigan, including its 62 percent ownership of Mercom.</p>
<p>C-TEC had proposed to acquire full ownership of Mercom through a stock swap currently under consideration by a special committee of the Mercom board, it said. Those talks are suspended until the spin-offs are completed.</p>
<p>The company said the previously announced restructuring will enhance future capital-raising efforts, provide more focused, equity-based employee incentives and make it easier for the investment community to track the performance of the three distinct and independent businesses.</p>
<p>McCourt said the restructuring should be completed by the end of the year.</p>
