<p>California's Department of Insurance said it still opposes  Prudential Insurance Co of America's proposed class-action settlement of consumer sales complaints.</p>
<p>A department spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the state was in talks with Prudential about a possible settlement.</p>
<p>California was one of four states that opposed Prudential's proposed class-action settlement. Two of the other states, Florida and Texas, said Thursday they reached agreements to settle with Prudential.</p>
<p>Massachusetts, which also has opposed the Prudential class-action settlement, declined immediate comment.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing new from our office at this point,&quot; a California insurance department spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Last month, California insurance commissioner Chuck Quackenbush said his department had issued subpoenas as part of a stepped up investigation of Prudential's practices.</p>
<p>In addition, he said he was seeking to suspend Prudential's license in the state if the company did not fairly and adequately compensate hundreds of thousands of policyholders.</p>
<p>Under the proposed class-action settlement, Prudential agreed to pay at least $410 million to as many as 10.7 million policyholders who bought permanent life insurance between 1982 and 1985.</p>
<p>That class-action agreement reached in September had improved the terms of an earlier settlement Prudential reached with a multi-state task force of insurance regulators.</p>
<p>Insurance regulators from 43 states and Washington D.C. last summer recommended a $35 million fine and a restitution program for sales abuses by Prudential.</p>
<p>Prudential later reached settlements with the various holdout states.</p>
<p>Just last week, Prudential agreed to pay $384,200 to settle a lawsuit brought by Virginia and acknowledged that some policyholders may have been misled by Prudential agents.</p>
<p>Florida earlier Thursday said it reached a multi-million dollar agreement in principle to settle the deceptive sales practice charges against Prudential.</p>
<p>And Texas said it also had reached a settlement.</p>
<p>The agreements lessen considerably the opposition Prudential will face Monday at a hearing in U.S. district court to determine the fairness of its proposed class-action settlement.</p>
<p>In December, Florida, California, Masschusetts and Texas had urged district judge Alfred Wolin to reject the class-action settlement, calling it unfair to consumers.</p>
