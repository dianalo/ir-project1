<p>Spot power prices in the western U.S. slipped amid abundant offers from marketers and expected warmer weather next week, trade sources said Friday.</p>
<p>The combination of Monday with Tuesday deals due to the Presidents Day holiday also put downward pressure on melded prices, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Loads are coming off and there is a holiday on Monday so prices are a bit softer,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Another trader noted that most of the offers were from power marketers, with utilities relatively reluctant sellers at lower prices.</p>
<p>&quot;They (utilities) have the option of selling in the real-time market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest was expected to see temperatures 4 to 8 degrees F above average through Sunday, and near normal through early next week.</p>
<p>The Southwest was expected to see temperatures 3 to 6 degrees above normal through Monday, and near normal early next week.</p>
<p>Firm, peak electricity at the California-Oregon border (COB) for Monday-Tuesday was quoted at $10.50-$11.50 a megawatt hour (MWh), compared with $12.00-12.75 for Friday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak COB deliveries for Monday-Tuesday were unchanged at $7.50-8.00.</p>
<p>Firm, peak electricity at Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) for Monday-Tuesday was quoted at $10.00-11.00, compared with $10.50-11.50 for Friday.</p>
<p>Off-peak Mid-C for day-ahead delivery was quoted at $5.50-6.50.</p>
<p>Firm, peak Palo Verde (PV) electricity was quoted at $13.00-14.00, while off-peak deliveries were at $7.00-8.00.</p>
<p>Next-day firm, peak power at Four Corners was quoted at $14.00-15.00, while off-peak remained at $7.00-9.00.</p>
