<p>U.S. Treasury bond futures' relentless bull run has again caught the market guessing whether its extended oscillator indicators are signs of strong momentum or oversold conditions, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>While virtually all technical and fundamental readings point to higher bond prices in the long run, concern that a correction is overdue continues to intimidate the bulls as it has throughout the market's three-month rally, they said.</p>
<p>Stewart Taylor, president of Taylor Consulting, said the percent-K and D values of the daily stochastic have gone above the 80 level for the third time during the rally.  </p>
<p>&quot;That's very unusual,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Still, the uptrend has been so strong that it was dangerous to try to pick a top, he noted.</p>
<p>September T-bond futures extended gains today and briefly rose to a high of 115-22/32 today, taking out the December 3 high of 115-17/32, before pulling back slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't jump in front of a freight train just to see if it stops,&quot; Taylor said.</p>
<p>Terence Gabriel, a technical analyst at I.D.E.A., agreed and offered a two-sided game plan.  </p>
<p>That target was the December 3 high on the continuation contract chart, coinciding with the low in cash bond yield, and also another significant Gann Line, he said.</p>
<p>Gabriel said he would become less bullish if the September contract slid below 114-1/2, but the market looked overwhelmingly bullish.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Commodity Research Burueau index  .CRB, whose decline had helped the bonds rally in recent months, appeared to have been forming a near-term bottoming pattern in the last two weeks or so.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing rising daily oscillators throughout this slightly upwardly sloped basing pattern,&quot; Gabriel said. &quot;It does suggest there's a kind of internal momentum brewing for some kind of a continued gain.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that the CRB index was still probably in a downtrend, merely correcting after eight straight weeks of lower weekly lows and black weekly candlesticks.</p>
