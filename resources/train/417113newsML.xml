<p>Lloyd's Register (LR), the world's leading ship classification society, said the world ship order book had fallen by 3.2 million gross tonnage at the end of 1996 compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>It revealed the global orderbook for ship newbuildings stood at 45.3 million gross tons at the end of last year compared with 48.5 million gt at December 1995 in its latest quarterly edition of World Shipbuilding Statistics.</p>
<p>Japan remained the top shipbuilding nation, LR said, with an orderbook of 13.7 million gt corresponding to more than 30 percent of the market.</p>
<p>It added that South Korea retained second position with 13.2 million gt, having obtained nearly three million gt in new orders during the last quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>They were followed by China with 2.7 million gt, Germany with 2.0 million gt, Italy with 1.9 million gt and Poland with 1.8 million gt, LR said.</p>
<p>LR added that in terms of gross tonnage, 61 percent of the world ship orderbook is expected to be delivered by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The world order book comprises 2,519 ships of which cargo carrying vessels amount to 1,988 ships of 44.7 million gt and 62.0 million deadweight tonnes (dwt).</p>
<p>The orderbook for the last quarter of 1996 included dry bulk vessels with a combined 6.8 million compensated gross tonnage (cgt) and 24.5 million dwt, and oil tankers with a total 4.1 million cgt and 15.4 million dwt.</p>
<p>The largest single category of vessels by cgt was container ships with 8.1 million cgt reported.</p>
<p>Orders of oil tankers outweighed completions in the latest period by 1.6 million dwt and container ships by 600,000 dwt. But the reverse was true, by 200,000 dwt, for dry bulk vessels, LR said. --Paul Berrill Reuters Shipping News + 44 171 542 4087 Fax 8077</p>
