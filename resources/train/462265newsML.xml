<p>Liggett Group's pact breaking away from other cigarette makers will spur few defections in the stretches of the southern United States where tobacco has been king for centuries.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobacco farmers will continue to have a market, regardless of the success or failure of the suits,&quot; North Carolina State Attorney General Mike Easley said.</p>
<p>Tobacco is North Carolina's single biggest crop and the plant's broad, brown leaves sustain thousands of manufacturing, financial and other jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobacco supports 200,000 families in North Carolina,&quot; said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for state Gov. Jim Hunt.</p>
<p>Tennessee, Virgina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Georgia are also major tobacco-growing states.</p>
<p>The maker of Chesterfields and L&amp;M branded cigarettes, Liggett last week rocked the tobacco business and Wall Street by agreeing to settle lawsuits with 22 state attorneys general</p>
<p>Liggett promised to pay 25 percent of its pre-tax profits for the next quarter century and label its cigarettes as addictive substances. It also agreed to hand over to the attorneys general internal documents which might bolster multi-billion dollar claims against other cigarette makers.</p>
<p>No cigarette company but Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group, has made such a deal. Other cigarette makers, such as Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, fiercely condemned the pact.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll give everybody something to talk about, but I don't think it will cause any adverse effects in the short term,&quot; said William Graham, a retired Farm Credit Services loan officer in Proctorville, in southeastern North Carolina.</p>
<p>&quot;I just don't think people are aware of just how much tax money tobacco generates in this country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What I want to say is not fit to print,&quot; said tobacco grower Grady Britt of Broad Ridge, also in southeastern North Carolina, where tobacco has been a mainstay for more than 200 years.</p>
<p>Other growers worried that the Liggett pact was another sign that tobacco, also a major export accounting last year for about 20 percent of the U.S. net agricultural trade surplus, was headed for hard times.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's going to take tobacco away from us, but they aren't going to give anything back,&quot; said Newberry Mitchell, a grower since the early 1960s.</p>
<p>&quot;All this decision is going to do is give the government more ammunition to classify tobacco as a drug and regulate it,&quot; said Erskine Floyd, another grower who lives in Barnesville, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Easley, the North Carolina attorney general, has not filed a lawsuit against cigarette makers and said the settlement on Thursday was less important than it appeared.</p>
<p>He described Liggett, the fifth-ranked cigarette maker with only a sliver of the market, as a minor industry player and said the legal grounding for the lawsuits by the attorneys general was shaky.</p>
