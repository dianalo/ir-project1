<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle Wednesday sold at $64.00 per cwt in moderate volume, unchanged from active sales late Tuesday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales at $64.00 were up $2.00 from top prices last week.</p>
<p>About 20,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, which brought the week to date figure near 87,000. An estimated 10,000 sold in Kansas, with weekly movement pegged near 64,000, the sources said.</p>
<p>A few pens sold in the Panhandle at $65.00 delivered to the plant, which was equivalent to the $64.00 packers paid for pickup at the feedlots, cattle feeders said.  </p>
<p>Fed cattle prices turned higher this week amid a stronger tone to boxed beef cut-out values, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Heavyweight choice beef at midday was quoted at $100.02 per cwt, up $0.98 since prices turned higher after Thursday's close, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Strong packer demand for the cattle also could be tied to a need to keep live inventories on tap to fill beef orders booked in late June/early July, market sources said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle price gains also were underpinned by ideas that summer cattle suppies were near a peak and poised to trend lower into autumn, they said.</p>
