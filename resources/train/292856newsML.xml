<p>Enserch Exploration Inc said the SB-3 well at its deep-water project in the Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico has been completed and production is expected to start later this month as subsea tie backs are in place to transport hydrocarbons to the production facility located three miles east on Block 388.</p>
<p>The SB-3, on Block 387, was drilled to a depth of 19,000 feet and was completed in a 50-foot sand 18,170 feet, Enserch said. &quot;Based on (undisclosed) initial flow rates, we expect the well to have initial production rates in the range of 20 to 25 million cubic feet of (natural) gas per day,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Both blocks are part of Enserch's Cooper project, located near the edge of the outer continental shelf offshore western Louisiana.</p>
<p>Enserch said it is operator of the Cooper project with a 60 percent working interest. The remaining 40 percent is held by Mobil Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first well in the Cooper area that has tested the Auger sands,&quot; Enserch said. &quot;The producing interval is part of the upper Auger sands series.</p>
<p>&quot;While production rates and flowing pressures from this well are substantial, we would caution that the sustainability of production at such high rates is better determined after a period of production history.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately, the company said its A-2 well on Block 388 reached total depth of 9,835 feet, encountering three pay zones in the 7,200-foot, 7,600-foot and 9,800-foot sands.</p>
<p>The well will be completed initially in the 9,800-foot sand, which has a total of 116 feet of oil pay.  Initial production from this well is expected in February.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to pursue the multi-year development of the Cooper project, it said, &quot;and additional wells are planned for 1997.&quot; ((-- Jim Brumm 212-859-1710.))</p>
