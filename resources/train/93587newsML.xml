<title>COLOMBIA: Colombian stocks edge up amid heavy cross dealing.</title>
<headline>Colombian stocks edge up amid heavy cross dealing.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA 1996-10-03</dateline>

<p>Colombian stocks closed marginally up in a session marked by cross deals between shareholders, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bogota's IBB index edged up a slim 0.15 percent to 870.11 on a 3.3 billion peso trading volume. Two billion pesos of that volume corresponded to a cross trade between existing shareholders in insurance company Compania Suramericana de Seguros, part of the powerful Sinidcato Antioqueno industrial conglomerate. Medellin's IBOMED general price index closed 0.14 percent higher at 13,652.98 on the back of a thin 420 million peso volume.  </p>
<p>&quot;In recent days there has been at least one large trade a day, generally a cross deal in Sindicato Antioqueo shares. That's kept the volume up, but in general terms the market is very depressed,&quot; a broker in Bogota said.</p>
<p>The price of Suramericana de Seguros remained unchanged at 18,500 pesos each. The day's other main movers in the Bogota exchange included little-traded construction materials company Bisn SA, which each rose 0.26 percent to 381 on a volume of 401 million pesos. Cement manufaturer Industrias y Inversiones Samper traded 420 million pesos to close at 555 pesos.  </p>
<p>&quot;The movements in today's session were tied to little-traded shares. That's the trend at the moment given that leading shares are only being traded in small volumes,&quot; the broker added.</p>
<p>Price performance is unsettled at the moment, the broker explained, because there has not yet been a significant cut in interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign funds are looking to buy shares that are also quoted in the United States. These funds are looking for those shares that are only listed in Colombia, but want to pay below market prices which is not beneficial,&quot; the Bogota broker said.</p>
