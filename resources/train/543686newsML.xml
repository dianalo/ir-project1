<title>AUSTRALIA: RetireInvest to compensate clients in Adelaide losses.</title>
<headline>RetireInvest to compensate clients in Adelaide losses.</headline>
<dateline>ADELAIDE 1997-04-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>National financial planning company RetireInvest said on Monday it would compensate South Australian clients for millions of dollars of investment funds lost amid allegations of unauthorised share trading.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst we do not believe we are liable, we believe the quickest way to solve the problem for the investors is to compensate them and for us then to follow through and pursue vigorously the people responsible,&quot; RetireInvest managing director Tony Muston told Reuters.</p>
<p>Muston said RetireInvest had referred to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) allegations of unauthorised share trading conducted through Adelaide stockbroking firm Thompson Brindal Ltd affecting clients of RetireInvest licensed franchise agent Ken Laming.</p>
<p>The South Australian police fraud squad and the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on Monday confirmed they were also investigating the matter.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports have said investors may have lost up to A$10 million in unauthorised trading, with allegations that blue-chip share portfolios were replaced with speculative stock without their knowledge or permission.</p>
<p>Muston said he could not give an exact figure but said there were millions of dollars in losses affecting about 150 clients of Laming, whose authority as a licensed advisor now had been cancelled.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to stress no other clients anywhere in Australia are affected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Muston said he believed the ASX should have investigated unusual trading activity in speculative stocks involved in the matter, and that the ASX's clearing and settlement system, CHESS, could do with slight improvement.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, if the holder identification number was a secret like your PIN number at a bank, this (matter) could not have occurred,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ASX earlier on Monday defended CHESS (clearing house electronic subregister system), saying it was not at fault in any losses incurred by the RetireInvest investors.</p>
<p>&quot;ASX wants to take this opportunity to assure investors about the integrity of CHESS,&quot; ASX managing director Richard Humphry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The matter involving RetireInvest and (broker) Thompson Brindal is about 'authority to deal',&quot; he said.</p>
