<p>The Belgian employers' federation (FEB/VBO) on Tuesday urged the government to implement quickly planned measures to control 1997 spending.</p>
<p>Determined to get its deficit down to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1997 to be allowed to join a future single European currency, the government announced a further 10 billion francs ($280.2 million) of austerity measures in its budget review in March.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though the government has just ratified a series of more structural measures to control spending, one must still insist on the urgency with which they are put into effect,&quot; the FEB said in a research note on the Belgian economy.</p>
<p>If not, the budgetary reserve of 20 billion francs would be quickly used up. That money was put aside as a safeguard against an economic downturn or higher interest rates which would inflate the cost of servicing Belgium's huge debt.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unacceptable if this led to a new increase in (employers') charges,&quot; the FEB added.</p>
<p>Presenting the report, FEB economist Baudouin Velge said high labour costs as a result of employers' large social contributions bill remained a handicap for exporters. As a result Belgium had lost market share in the EU and Asia in 1996.</p>
<p>The FEB cast doubt on the government's ability to meet its 1997 target of a 3.1 percent nominal fall in health care spending, noting that it had never decreased year-on-year before, and in 1996 had risen by much more than the norm.</p>
<p>The federation added that mutual health care funds had shown recently that at best health spending could only be stabilised. It noted that between 1991 and 1995 30 percent of planned health care savings had never been achieved.</p>
<p>For 1997 the FEB forecast real GDP growth of up to two percent, compared to 1.4 percent growth in 1996.</p>
<p>An economic pick-up in the European Union as a whole would boost Belgian exports, while imports would increase to a lesser extent. But it said wild cards in the forecast were exports and consumption, which could influence growth either way.</p>
<p>The FEB did not expect private consumption growth in 1997 to be any higher than in 1996.</p>
<p>Industry sectors expected to see general improvement -- in areas other than employment -- included construction, metals, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, textiles, paper and cardboard. The temporary jobs sector remained optimistic too.</p>
<p>Clothing, wood and food sectors expected a weak 1997.</p>
