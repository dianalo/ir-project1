<p>The French public deficit could come in at 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, afternoon daily Le Monde said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Citing &quot;very reliable sources&quot;, Le Monde said the deficit was at this stage heading for 3.6 percent of GDP by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Le Monde said the government had decided it would have too negative an effect on the economy to push hard for three percent this year and that it would be acceptable for the deficit to be at or very near three percent in 1998 as long as it was falling steadily over the two year period.</p>
<p>The paper reiterated the widely held view that the problem is on the tax revenues rather than the spending side and said the other main problem was the social security deficit, which was likely to be &quot;significantly&quot; above 40 billion francs this year.</p>
<p>The previous government's 1997 budget aimed for a deficit of 30 billion francs and just before it was ousted from power it had acknowledged the deficit would more likely come in at about 35 billion.</p>
<p>French newspapers have been speculating that the social security deficit could be anything up to 47 billion francs.</p>
