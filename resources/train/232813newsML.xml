<p>New York Federal Reserve president William McDonough said on Tuesday that any specific inflation target range as a monetary policy goal would have to be decided by the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;I have suggested that there might be a range but that should be decided by Congress,&quot; McDonough told a news conference in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Some economists have suggested that the Fed should have a specific inflation goal rather simply seeking price stability.</p>
<p>McDonough reiterated his suggestion of a 0.5 to 2.0 percent target range for annual retail inflation.  </p>
<p>But McDonough said risking a weaker U.S. economy just to push down the inflation rate a few tenths of a percentage point would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>McDonough said the present level of consumer price inflation (CPI) at just under three percent &quot;might be somewhat higher than what most people would consider price stability&quot;.</p>
<p>But he noted that the way CPI was calculated tended to overstate actual inflation. A committee studying this phenomenon was expected to release a report on Wednesday, he said.</p>
<p>McDonough said if the study showed that inflation is lower than the CPI indicates, then the United States may already be at levels of inflation consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>&quot;If it isn't, then we are still close,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With inflation relatively low, McDonough indicated actively trying to push it down further may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not appropriate to risk a weakening in the economy for driving the CPI down a few tenths of a percentage point,&quot; he said.</p>
