<p>At least 10 people, including three children, were injured when a large explosion wrecked a Turkish-owned grocery store in the north German city of Bremen overnight, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>One of those injured was in a critical condition and the store was completely destroyed, a police spokesman said. Neighbouring buildings and nearby cars were badly damaged.</p>
<p>The spokesman said it was too early to say whether the blast was an accident or a deliberate act.</p>
<p>Around 2.2 million Turks live in Germany. Their property has been the target of several waves of firebomb attacks, sometimes carried out by right-wing extremists but recently more often as the result of rivalries within the Turkish community.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the value of the damage could not yet be estimated but it was certainly well over one million marks.</p>
