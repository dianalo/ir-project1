<p>The blast from a small bomb planted near a railway station in the southern Spanish city of Seville injured one person on Tuesday, region officials said.</p>
<p>Officials did not say whether it was an attack by ETA Basque separatist rebels, but the group has often used bombs in the 29-year independence drive in which it has killed some 800 people.</p>
<p>The officials said the injured person was a construction worker who was taken to hospital and was only slightly hurt.</p>
<p>The bomb, which exploded at 2.15 p.m. (1215 GMT), had been planted in construction materials near the Santa Justa station, officials said.</p>
<p>ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) has killed seven people since the start of the year.</p>
