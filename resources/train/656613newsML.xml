<title>USA: Grains fall on crop estimates, pork price drops.</title>
<headline>Grains fall on crop estimates, pork price drops.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wheat prices fell on Thursday after the Agriculture Department said the United States would harvest its biggest crop in three years.</p>
<p>Corn and soybean prices also closed mostly lower as the outlook for bumper crops this fall improved. Pork prices also fell sharply on a cut in projected exports this year, while lumber soared amid worries about forest fires in Canada.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for July delivery closed 11-1/2 cents a bushel lower at $3.53, just above the 4-month low of $3.51 reached on June 5.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department in its monthly world crop report estimated that U.S. winter wheat production would total 1.604 billion bushels this year, above the average estimate of analysts at 1.579 billion and above the department's own forecast of 1.561 billion bushels issued in May.</p>
<p>The total wheat crop, including spring and durum wheat, was put at 2.30 bilion bushels, up 43 million bushels from the department's estimate last month due to improved weather.</p>
<p>The estimates came on the heels of a crop tour by analysts this week that found the winter wheat crop from Ohio to Arkansas in good shape and generally free of diseases. Wheat is already being harvested in Texas and other southern fields.</p>
<p>&quot;The production number was bearish and the crop tour was bearish,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter. &quot;There's not as much disease as expected and yields are better than expected.&quot;</p>
<p>The government kept its estimates for this year's corn and soybean crops unchanged, with soybeans projected at a record 2.60 billion bushels and corn at a near-record 9.84 billion.</p>
<p>Those numbers kept selling pressure on harvest months, with December delivery corn closing down 1-1/4 cents a bushel at $2.54-1/4 and November soybeans down 2 cents at $6.71.</p>
<p>But extremely tight remaining stocks of soybeans and buying interest from China for soybeans and soymeal continued to underpin pre-harvest deliveries, with July soybeans closing up 11 cents a bushel at $8.41-1/2 and July soymeal up $2.60 a ton at $276.70.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, prices for pork belly futures ended down the allowable daily trading limit of 3 cents a pound after the Agriculture Department said pork exports to Japan would not be as large as expected this year.</p>
<p>Bellies for July delivery closed at 78.90 cents, down 3 cents a pound.</p>
<p>The department's Meat Supply and Use Forecast cut its estimate for 1997 pork exports by 105 million pounds to 1.250 billion pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand in Japan seems weak and we're just not getting the business we expected,&quot; said James Nix, chairman of the World Agricultural Outlook Board's committee on meat.</p>
<p>U.S. pork exports in 1996 totaled 951 million pounds.</p>
<p>Pork prices in the United States rose sharply after Taiwan suddenly suspended its booming pork exports on March 20 following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease there. Taiwan had been the top pork supplier to Japan, the leading importer.</p>
<p>Lumber prices jumped on continuing reports of forest fires in Canada, the leading wood exporter to the United States, and a firmer tone for spruce wood in eastern markets.</p>
<p>Lumber for July delivery at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed up the $10 daily trading limit at $362.40 per thousand board feet.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is showing some signs of improving here and there,&quot; said Curt Cunningham of Pacific Futures Trading.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for July delivery closed 0.15 cent a pound higher at 207.80 cents as the market awaited an Agriculture Department estimate on the size of Brazil's next crop that is due on Friday.</p>
<p>Brazilian sources have put estimates of Brazil's next crop at anywhere from 20 to 25 million 132-pound bags, compared with this year's expected 27 million.</p>
<p>The crop in Brazil, which supplies more than a quarter of the world's coffee, is now being harvested.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices edged higher in mainly technical trade as expirations of options contracts on Friday prompted buying.</p>
<p>A report that Iraq's oil sales under a United Nations deal might be delayed also added some support, traders said.</p>
<p>Crude oil for July delivery closed at $18.69 a barrel, up 16 cents. July unleaded gasoline ended up 0.54 cent a gallon at 57.08 cents and July heating oil up 0.10 cent a gallon at 51.62 cents.</p>
<p>Antonio Monteiro, chairman of the U.N. sanctions committee on Iraq, said late on Wednesday that Baghdad would submit a new pricing formula for oil sales under its oil-for-food deal only after agreement on a food distribution plan, which U.N. officials said would be completed around the end of the month.</p>
<p>Iraqi oil exports have been under U.N. trade sanctions since Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but Baghdad was allowed to sell limited oil to buy food and medicines under a renewable six-month deal agreed with the United Nations last December. The renewed plan came into force on June 8.</p>
