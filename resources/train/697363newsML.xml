<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>- Maltese nun murdered in Pakistan by hooded burglar who broke into convent in search of cash held in readiness to pay workers.</p>
<p>L-ORIZZONT</p>
<p>- Central Bank suggests independent body holds investigation into whether government-appointed Bank of Valletta chairman John Grech had conflict of interest through his directorship of firms which give advice to companies before they request bank loans.</p>
<p>- New tax system should lead to lower prices on services, says Prime Minister Alfred Sant. Malta's VAT will be replaced by a system of excise duties on Tuesday. Services previously charged 15 percent tax will now be charged five percent excise duty.</p>
<p>IN-NAZZJON</p>
<p>- Opposition leader Eddie Fenech Adami tells political rally that replacement of VAT by system of excise duties will see most prices rise, particularly since imports from non-EU countries will be taxed at least 23 percent. EU imports will be taxed at 15 percent, the same as the current VAT rate. But all imports will also be subject to a new five percent excise tax on products.</p>
