<p>Peru's Jewish Association added its voice on Tuesday to growing protests against the government's annulment of citizenship for Israeli-born television station owner Baruch Ivcher.</p>
<p>A statement from the Jewish community's highest representative body expressed &quot;amazement and unease at an act of injustice that deprives a citizen's right which has been legitimately obtained and exercised since 1984.&quot;</p>
<p>The association pledged its &quot;solidarity&quot; with Ivcher, the owner of Frecuencia Latina station, and called on Peruvian authorities to &quot;rectify this measure as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Sunday's decision to revoke Ivcher's nationality on grounds of bureaucratic &quot;irregularities&quot; has sparked a wave of media and public outrage and become a rallying point for Peru's increasingly buoyant opposition.</p>
<p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, scores of journalists and Ivcher supporters kept vigil outside Frecuencia Latina's Lima headquarters amid rumours of a possible military intervention to take over the building.</p>
<p>Several thousand demonstrators also staged a noisy protest outside the building on Monday evening. They chanted &quot;Ivcher is Peruvian&quot; and held placards saying &quot;Long Live Press Freedom!&quot; and &quot;Down With The Dictatorship.&quot;</p>
<p>In Washington, the United States also expressed concern about what it called Peru's harassment of Ivcher and said the case raises fundamental questions of press freedoms.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Ivcher is &quot;being harassed and threatened with criminal prosecution for his television station's reporting and commentary about Peruvian government officials and the Peruvian military.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is an issue of concern to us ... These actions raise fundamental questions of freedom of the press, and freedom of expression,&quot; Burns told reporters, noting that &quot;the need to respect freedom of expression and of the press is an essential element of democracy and ... American foreign policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The government cancelled Ivcher's citizenship because of alleged omissions in the application forms and lack of proof that he had given up his Israeli nationality. The documents were, however, signed and approved in 1984 by then President Fernando Belaunde, who has denied there were irregularities.</p>
<p>Ivcher, who is in Miami because of alleged political persecution and death threats, said on Tuesday that the Peruvian government was carrying out a campaign &quot;to finish off free journalism.&quot;</p>
<p>The revocation of his nationality followed a string of stories by Frecuencia Latina alleging corruption and rights abuses in President Alberto Fujimori's security forces.</p>
<p>Ivcher, 57, who left Israel in 1970, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Miami that the government had resorted to &quot;gangster-like methods ... to strip my citizenship.&quot; His lawyers in Peru are appealing the case.</p>
<p>&quot;What they want to do is get the channel out of my hands to deliver it to my partners,&quot; added Ivcher, who has a Peruvian wife and four children born locally.</p>
<p>His partners, brothers Mendel and Samuel Winter, have a minority stake but are said by Frecuencia Latina journalists to be negotiating the takeover of Ivcher's 54 percent stake. They are widely regarded as pro-government. &quot;They are an integral part of all this plot,&quot; said Ivcher, adding that the Winter brothers held dual nationality, Peruvian and Polish.</p>
<p>Local media, including normally pro-government sections, have been unanimous in their condemnation of the revocation of Ivcher's nationality. The right-wing Expreso, for example, blamed Peru's military on Tuesday for what it called the &quot;incredible persecution&quot; of Ivcher.</p>
<p>The charged political atmosphere sent the Lima Stock Exchange tumbling 5.64 percent, its highest fall of the year, and brought warnings from investors of damage to the economy.</p>
