<p>A federal jury awarded $1,402 in compensatory damages to Food Lion Inc. Monday after finding that ABC television reporters committed fraud in preparing an undercover report about alleged unsanitary food practices at the grocery chain.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for one hour before awarding Food Lion $1,400 on the fraud allegation, $1 for trespassing and $1 for breach of loyalty. The company had claimed damages of $2,432.35 in this phase of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Food Lion sued ABC and four producers, seeking $1.7 billion in damages to recoup losses it says it suffered as a result of an expose the network aired in 1992 about the food retailer on its &quot;PrimeTime Live&quot; news magazine show.</p>
<p>The jury, which will hear evidence on punitive damages later this week, ruled on Dec. 20 that journalists employed by ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co., committed trespassing and fraud in preparing the undercover report about Food Lion, which is based in Salisbury, N.C.</p>
<p>The panel said that two field producers and two executive producers of ABC committed the offences while preparing a report about Food Lion for broadcast on Nov. 5, 1992.</p>
<p>Food Lion, a unit of Belgian retailer Ets Delhaize Freres et Cie &quot;LE LION&quot; SA, claimed it lost $1.5 billion in stock value at the time of the broadcast and $233 million in profits after the broadcast.</p>
<p>Food Lion's stock was unchanged at $9.69 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market. Disney's stock lost 62.5 cents to $70.625 on the New York Stock Exchange</p>
