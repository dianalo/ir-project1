<p>International engineering firm TI Group Plc reported an eight percent rise in profits on Thursday and dismissed investor concerns about exchange rates by promising further growth.</p>
<p>But the share price dipped on profit-taking, having recovered 55 pence a share this week after a weaker pound helped calm fears that sterling's strength would hurt the group's extensive overseas operations.</p>
<p>Sterling rallied again in the foreign exchange markets on Thursday and TI's shares were down 28p at 541p by 1039 GMT.</p>
<p>The company reported pre-tax profits of 112.1 million pounds ($183.1 million) for the six months to June 30, compared to 103.7 million pounds reported last year after stripping out 21.6 million pounds of exceptional gains from disposals.</p>
<p>&quot;They were a very good set of results and I think the market will be very pleased with them,&quot; said Robert Speed, engineering analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares have bounced very sharply with the falling pound after being hit hard by the currency,&quot; said Tim Bennett, engineering analyst at Morgan Stanley. &quot;It's probably just some profit-taking.&quot;</p>
<p>The company increased its interim dividend 7.3 percent to 5.1 pence, on earnings of 16.1 pence a share, down from last year's 19.3 pence which was boosted by exceptional gains.</p>
<p>First-half sales rose four percent to 932.6 million pounds but the company said underlying sales growth was up nine percent after adjusting for acquisitions and disposals and changes in exchange rates.</p>
<p>The company dismissed recent share traders' fears that sterling's high exchange rates would hit TI's core businesses, pointing out that it was not a big exporter.</p>
<p>&quot;Our currency exposure is limited in the main to translation, not transaction, as we manufacture in some 45 countries around the world,&quot; chairman Sir Christopher Lewinton said. TI said the rise in the pound in the last year reduced reported sales by 70 million pounds and pretax profits by 7.6 million pounds in the half year, and the effect was likely to be similar for the current half.</p>
<p>&quot;If rates stay where they are we would expect about the same sort of hit in the second half,&quot; finance director Martin Angle told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the first half the group north American businesses increased operating profits by 9.8 million pounds to 58.5 million on sales up 2.4 percent at 407.8 million pounds.</p>
<p>Mainland European profits rose just 0.7 million pounds to 29.1 million pounds on sales up 12.7 percent at 250.6 million pounds while UK profits were flat at 24.4 million on sales up 4.8 percent at 176.2 million pounds.</p>
<p>Businesses in the rest of the world made profits of 8.5 million pounds, up on sales , up 10.3 percent, on sales up 18 percent at 98 million pounds.</p>
<p>The John Crane Group of engineered sealing products businesses increased operating profits by five percent to 50.4 million pounds on sales up 10 percent at 327.1 million pounds.</p>
<p>The Bundy Group, making narrow gauge tubing for the automotive and refrigeration industries, reported flat operating profits of 40.5 million pounds on sales down 1.4 million pounds at 374.2 million pounds.</p>
<p>Lewinton said the North American automotive market was doing well while national European markets remained mixed with France the main blackspot. But overall the Bundy business was doing well due to its geographical spread and a strong customer base.</p>
<p>Meanwhile TI's Dowty Group of aerospace businesses was enjoying the upturn in demand by the commercial aircraft manufacturers and profits rose 43 percent in the half year to 29.6 million pounds on sales up 11.2 million at 231.3 million pounds.</p>
<p>Lewinton said that with the effect of sterling's strength on the group largely an accounting problem, which did not affect cashflows, he was confident management could continue getting growth both from existing businesses and further bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
<p>As usual TI has several acquisitions in prospect, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We did eight bolt-ons last year and we are usually working on five or six at any point in time which is the case now,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>As to what the company could afford Lewinton pointed out that the company's net interest bill of 6.7 million pounds at the half year was covered 18 times by operating profit. Net debt stood at 78 million pounds, giving debt to equity gearing of 21 percent.</p>
