<title>UK: IPE upgrades natural gas trading system.</title>
<headline>IPE upgrades natural gas trading system.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>The International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) announced on Wednesday it has made a number of changes to the Energy Trading System (ETS), the screen-based system used for trading natural gas futures.</p>
<p>The changes include new warnings given when bids or offers are placed significantly above or below the last traded price. When a bid is more than 0.50 pence a therm above the last traded price, the warning &quot;limit price is significantly above last traded price&quot; is given. For an offer more than 0.50 pence a therm below the last traded price, the system warns &quot;limit price is significantly below last trade.&quot;</p>
<p>In a thin market where a traded price may not be available because no deals have been done in the period in question, the settlement price from the previous day is used as a reference.</p>
<p>In another change, traders will no longer be able to enter a bid higher than the best offer or enter an offer below the best bid.</p>
<p>&quot;This will bring the ETS in line with current practices on the trading floor where breaking the market is not allowed,&quot; the IPE said in a statement. But traders will still be able to use the &quot;fill down&quot; facility from the depth of market screen to take out more then one bid or offer at a time.</p>
<p>The changes follow a number of occasions since the launch of the natural gas contract on January 31 when trades have been done as a result of bids or offers entered in error. There have been trades &quot;busted&quot; by the exchange as a result.</p>
<p>Trade on the IPE natural gas contract has become thin in recent weeks after a relatively busy start. Only 310 lots have been done since May 12, with no trade concluded so far this week.</p>
