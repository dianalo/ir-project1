<title>ISRAEL: Israel provident funds cut equity holding in 1996.</title>
<headline>Israel provident funds cut equity holding in 1996.</headline>

<text>
<p>Israeli provident funds reduced holdings in equities last year but retained a major influence in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), a survey by Meitav Investments and Securities released on Sunday showed.</p>
<p>Meitav said that among the five biggest provident funds covered in the survey, which Meitav estimated accounted for 64 percent of total provident assets, the equities portion fell to a preliminary 11.5 percent at the end of 1996 from 12.9 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;This decline...came as part of a intentional effort to reduce their holdings in stocks, as evidenced by the fact that the value of share prices themselves barely fell during 1996,&quot; said Meitav, a brokerage house and fund manager that tracks the mutual and provident fund industries.</p>
<p>Meitav said the provident funds nevertheless continued to play an important role in the Israeli stock market.</p>
<p>It said the 8.5 billion shekels of holdings in stocks and convertible bonds held by the five biggest funds accounted for 7.3 percent of the TASE's market capitalisation. It estimated total provident fund equity holdings, including funds not surveyed, reached 9.5 percent of market capitalisation.</p>
<p>Meitav said the provident funds' influence was even bigger among heavy capitalisation shares, which it estimated accounted for more than three fourths of all their equity holdings.</p>
<p>Meitav said the five surveyed funds' held more than 15 percent of all equity in companies traded in the TASE's Mishtanim index of top 100 shares.</p>
<p>The provident funds, which are long-term saving schemes, hold the majority of their assets in government bonds. Meitav estimated the funds' total assets at 111 billion shekels, including surveyed and unsurveyed funds.</p>
