<p>South African and European Union negotiators will meet next week to resume stalled trade talks which Pretoria hopes will give it easier access to EU markets, the Department of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>South Africa broke a months-long impasse last month when it handed over its negotiating mandate to EU officials.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the department said in a statement that talks between the two sides would resume in Pretoria on January 24.</p>
<p>&quot;At this meeting the South African government will present a document outlining its position on a long term agreement on trade and economic cooperation and it will form a basis for discussions with the EU,&quot; the department said.</p>
<p>The EU, which absorbs some 40 percent of South African exports and accounts for more than a third of South African imports, set out its negotiating mandate in March last year.</p>
<p>Brussels's position was criticised by several influential parties in South Africa as being too harsh on the country and its smaller southern African neighbours.</p>
<p>The EU -- under pressure from its own agricultural lobby -- has refused post-apartheid South Africa full accession to the Lome Convention which grants favourable access to its markets to developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Its proposal would exclude nearly 40 percent of South Africa's agricultural products from a future free trade deal, while calling on it to reduce tariffs to ensure easier access to its markets for European producers.</p>
<p>South African parliamentarians criticised this fiercely, claiming that the EU had failed to take into account the very different sizes and levels of development of the economies of the negotiating partners.</p>
<p>In turn, the EU criticised South Africa for dragging its heels in presenting its own position.</p>
<p>With the demise of apartheid, South Africa's agriculture products have been making steady inroads into Europe and other world markets. Producers also benefitted from the rand currency shedding 29 percent of its value against the dollar last year.</p>
<p>There have been growing concerns within the southern Africa region about the impact of a free trade deal between Pretoria and Brussels on the economies of some of South Africa's smaller neighbours.</p>
<p>Other members of the five-nation South Africa Customs Union (SACU) -- Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland -- fear they will lose millions in income from the joint customs revenue pool.</p>
