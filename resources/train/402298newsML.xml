<p>Communist Refoundation promised to support the Italian government on Tuesday in a parliamentary vote of confidence over the last part of the 1997 budget, but said it did not see the need for any more belt-tightening.</p>
<p>Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti met Prime Minister Romano Prodi early on Tuesday to discuss government plans to introduce a fresh package of measures aimed at preparing the economy for the 1999 launch of the single European currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider a mini-budget to be unnecessary, and if it was up to us we would not do it,&quot; said Bertinotti, whose party secures Prodi's majority in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;But the government thinks it is necessary so we are open to talks,&quot; he told reporters, adding that Refoundation could not accept any further cut in social spending or additional taxes.</p>
<p>Italy has adopted a series of increasingly tough budgets over the past five years in a bid to repair the damage done by free-spending administrations at the end of the 1980s and become a founder member of the single currency.</p>
<p>The latest package of measures, introduced at the end of last year, was designed to slash a massive 62.5 trillion lire ($37.5 billion) off the public sector deficit during 1997.</p>
<p>The final section of this package, which accounts for 4.3 trillion lire of the savings, still needs parliamentary approval and in a bid to sweep aside hundreds of opposition amendments to the measures, the government has called a do-or-die confidence vote in the lower house for 1200 GMT Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will vote for the confidence motion, no doubts about that,&quot; Bertinotti told reporters.</p>
<p>The centre-left coalition staged numerous confidence votes in both the upper and lower house last year to sidestep opposition filibustering and ram a wide range of legislation onto the statute books.</p>
<p>Prodi, who took office last May, had hoped that the 1997 budget would be enough to guarantee Italy a berth in European economic and monetary union (EMU), but his plans were wrecked by an unexpected overshoot in 1996 state spending.</p>
<p>To mop up the damage, he announced last week that his centre-left cabinet was working on a new mini-budget, which would focus on structural measures.</p>
<p>Analysts expect it to include up to 15 trillion lire of deficit cuts and many have urged Prodi to prune welfare spending -- especially the generous state pensions system.</p>
<p>News of yet another dose of strong budget medicine on the way has received a frosty reception from left wingers and the largest trades' union federation, the Cgil.</p>
<p>&quot;A mini-budget is useless and unwelcome,&quot; Cgil leader Sergio Cofferati told La Stampa newspaper on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But Prodi got backing for his crusade to tame the deficit from European Union Commissioner, Mario Monti, who said on Tuesday that Italy needed to be in the vanguard of EMU to boost employment and production prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Today one can say that Italy probably will take part in the single currency,&quot; Monti told a parliamentary committee in Rome. Only a few months ago...it seemed certain that it would be excluded. Italy has taken a major step forward,&quot; he added.</p>
