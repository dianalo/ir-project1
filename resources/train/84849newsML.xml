<headline>KomiTEK to tender 38 pct stake, issue bonds.</headline>

<p>NK KomiTEK oil group and the Russian privatisation authorities are considering a combination of investment tender and convertible bonds for a planned sale of a 38 percent stake, a KomiTEK official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Depending on the way the investment tender is organised and on how the stake is split into lots, the second stage of the tender could be an issue of convertible bonds for shares which are to be auctioned,&quot; Alexei Antipov, finance director of KomiTEK-Moscow, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The tender regulations are being prepared by KomiTEK jointly with officials from Russia's State Property Committee and the Russian Federal Property Fund.</p>
<p>Antipov said the tender would be held by the end of the year. He could not say if bonds would cover the entire stake or just a part of it.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is known that the investment will be channelled into the construction of a new Kharyaga-Usinsk oil pipeline, which will cost $120 million. And we hope to receive part of this sum at the tender,&quot; Antipov said.</p>
<p>The new pipeline with an annual capacity of 10 million tonnes of oil will run parallel to an existing one repaired with part of a $124 million World Bank loan.</p>
<p>The loan was granted to KomiTEK's main operating unit, AO Komineft, to help it deal with a huge oil leak from the pipeline near the town of Usinsk in 1994, Antipov said.</p>
<p>Vladimir Repnikov, deputy president of KomiTEK-Moscow, said in January the company was planning to issue five-year convertible bonds worth 38 percent its stake and to sell another 55 percent of shares at investment tenders and cash auctions in the course of the year.</p>
<p>Antipov said the bonds issue project had been worked out with London-based investment bank SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>1.12 percent of KomiTEK shares were sold at a specialised auction on November 29-December 19 last year at 1,000 roubles per share. Three percent of shares were sold at 1,199 roubles each at a cash auction on February 16 this year.</p>
<p>The authorised capital of NK KomiTEK is 1.66 billion roubles. Shares have a nominal value of 10 roubles.</p>
<p>KomiTEK, based in the oil-rich Arctic Timan-Pechora region, was set up in 1994, with the federal government receiving 42.5 percent, and the government of the Komi republic receiving 57.5 percent.</p>
<p>The company's 1995 profit before tax according to Russian accountancy standards was 69.32 billion roubles.</p>
<p>Antipov said by the end of the year the company would publish a 1995 balance sheet audited by Deloitte &amp; Touche to U.S. GAAP accountancy standards.</p>
