<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is likely to pause this week before making a run at its next target of 13,000 points, analysts said.</p>
<p>The blue chip index broke record after record last week, registering an all-time intra-day high of 12,898.30 on Thursday. It gained 221.89 points, or 1.77 percent, during the week and closed at 12,751.16 on Friday, up 15.90 points on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reached new peaks and we need some time to consolidate,&quot; said Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas.</p>
<p>Analysts said gains in the U.S. long bond have been an important driver for the local stock market, and investors would continue to monitor the long bond yield.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now the long bond is going to a critical level. The resistance (on the yield) is at 6.5 percent,&quot; said Ricky Tam, senior research analyst at Delta Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Patrick Chia, research director at China Everbright Research, said both stocks and bonds in the United States were at high levels.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the bond yield has dropped to a very low level and the U.S. market is at a very high level, so perhaps it still needs time to take a break,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chia said the Hang Seng index could find itself trapped in a range of 12,600 to 12,800.</p>
<p>&quot;I think right after the consolidation, the Hang Seng index can test 13,000,&quot; he said. That target could be reached by the end of the year, he added.</p>
<p>Delta Asia's Tam said Hong Kong stocks could get a new lift this week if the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting leaves interest rates unchanged. The U.S. Federal Reserve's policy making body meets on November 13.</p>
<p>&quot;The market could test 13,000 (points)...by the end of this month,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were likely to search for lagging stocks and bargains this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say we'll see selective bargain hunting on some counters,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities. &quot;The conglomerates have been holding up rather poorly.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts expected only a moderate reponse to Anhui Expressway Co Ltd's market debut on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company offered 493.01 million H-shares at HK$1.77 per share, of which 73.95 million were in a Hong Kong initial public offering. The company said it received subscriptions totalling 76.66 million shares for the Hong Kong offering.</p>
<p>&quot;The subscription response is quite cool so I expect it to sink below the issue price,&quot; said Chia. &quot;The fundamentals are not that good -- they just have one expressway -- and the H-share sector is quite poor at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Henderson Land Development Co Ltd is due to hold its annual general meeting on Tuesday and Hopewell Holdings Ltd and its Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd unit are to hold their AGMs on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd has scheduled its AGM on Friday.</p>
