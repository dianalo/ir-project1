<p>Operations at the State Bank of India's Bombay head office are returning to normal after a week-long strike was called off on Thursday, union officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to stand on prestige, we want to minimise the damage,&quot; an official of SBI Officers' Federation told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said operations would be resumed at the earliest.</p>
<p>Employees went on strike in Bombay in protest over the suspension of three of their colleagues in connection with the collapse of a financial services firm.</p>
<p>The strike, confined to the Bombay office, was to have been extended to major cities on Thursday but was called off early in the day on assurances by the management that the suspensions would be reviewed.</p>
<p>One of the three suspended officers is being reinstated immediately while the other two will be inducted in a phased manner, the official said.</p>
<p>The three, accused of not following procedures in handling the account of CRB Capital Markets were suspended earlier this month, triggering the strike on June 12.</p>
<p>SBI was quoting in the foreign exchange market on Thursday.</p>
<p>SBI, a major lender in the overnight call money market, was not quoting on Thursday but dealers expect the bank to resume lending any time now. The market is not active as most banks have covered their requirements ahead of the reporting Friday.</p>
<p>SBI's top management is in Calcutta on Thursday for a board meeting to finalise accounts for the year ended March 31, 1997.</p>
