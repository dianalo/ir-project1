<p>Ohio Treasurer Ken Blackwell opposes raising the state sales and cigarette taxes to finance school funding reforms, contending that budget belt tightening could do the job, a spokeswoman said Thursday.</p>
<p>Blackwell, contemplating a bid to replace outgoing Gov. George Voinovich next year, believes controlling spending and possibly tapping some of Ohio's surplus could fund needed reforms, Jenny Camper said.</p>
<p>Ohio Supreme Court justices in March overturned the public school funding system and gave law makers one year to adopt an alternative shifting the weight of funding from local sources to the state.</p>
<p>A Voinovich-appointed task force recommended increasing aid by $1.1 billion in the current biennium and providing $5.8 billion for capital improvements over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Ohio Senate and house hearings into the recommendations to raise the state sales tax, cigarette tax and property taxes on businesses and commercial properties to finance the spending are expected to run the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The plan requires lawmakers to approve placing four constitutional amendments on the November ballot. Those referendums would have to be approved for placement by August 6.</p>
<p>Blackwell is a board member for the National Taxpayers Union, which opposed the spending plans in testimony before the Ohio Senate Finance Committee earlier this week, Camper noted.</p>
<p>Spending grew at twice the inflation rate last year and rose quicker than personal incomes in Ohio so freezing spending at current levels for all but prison and education issues would save about $2.1 billion, Camper said.</p>
<p>Blackwell plans to introduce an alternate funding proposal July 24, Camper added.</p>
<p>Ohio Senators have heard from a dozen entities thus far and have scheduled another five groups next week. Senators plan to vote on recommendations the week of July 21.</p>
