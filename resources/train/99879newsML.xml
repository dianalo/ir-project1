<headline>Wall St's 6,000 bid enthralls Euro shares.</headline>

<p>Wall Street's reconnaissance above 6,000 points helped European shares to end mostly firmer on Monday, although its inability to break higher killed off any independent ambitions the European markets might have had.</p>
<p>London and German shares touched new records in early trade, but were fading by early afternoon, when Wall Street came to their rescue by edging through 6,000 for the first time, touching a high of 6,002.17.</p>
<p>Wall Street soon retreated, however, and stood down 8.20 at 5,983.66 shortly after the European markets closed.</p>
<p>Share traders on both sides of the Atlantic are split between those who believe that U.S. shares are now vulnerable to profit-taking and those who see prices rallying further as the U.S. economy, which has been growing rapidly, slows to a more sustainable level of inflation-free growth.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares settled 6.7 up at 4,031.5 points, a new record close, after profit-taking in gilts, T-bonds and in U.S. stocks knocked the index off the day's earlier high of 4,046.8.</p>
<p>JP Morgan's European equity strategist Gary Dugan said he had raised his target for the FTSE 100.</p>
<p>&quot;There's every reason to believe the market can reach 4,300 before the election,&quot; he said in reference to the British election which must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>While institutional liquidity remains high, Dugan said a further advance in British shares was likely to be fuelled by an influx of cash from international investors.</p>
<p>Cory Miller, UK equity strategist with Credit Lyonnais Laing, said he expects to see more British institutional cash moving back into the FTSE 100 within the next few weeks as big dividend payouts due in October are reinvested.</p>
<p>British oil share were strong with shares in Shell Transport jumping 18-1/2p to 1017-1/2p, after setting a record at 1032p initially, as the oil giant confirmed reports that it was in talks with Texaco about a joint venture.</p>
<p>French shares closed fractionally lower on Wall Street, turning initial gains into small losses after spending the day in a very narrow trading range.</p>
<p>Germany's DAX index rose 19.36 points to 2,702.64, a new record closing high. Most of the gains were accounted for by the market catching up with the screen-based IBIS DAX index which hit 2,704.25 in post-bourse trading on Friday and ended at 2705.21 on Monday.</p>
<p>The dollar was near session lows in late Europe but stayed locked in familiar ranges as a subdued market contemplated a week promising few trading incentives.</p>
<p>It dipped against the yen in the European afternoon after being unsettled overnight by Japanese calls for higher interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>But analysts saw little on the horizon likely to stir up the dollar ahead of U.S. data due out on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets will be waiting for the U.S. PPI and retail sales -- ahead of that I don't see much excitement,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1600 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar ended European business at around 111.25 yen, off a session low of 111.15 but down from late Friday's European level of 111.55 and an Asian high of 111.95. It was little changed against the mark at 1.5312 marks versus 1.5304 on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS - CLOSING PRICES</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 6.7 points higher at a record 4,031.5.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished down 1.14 at 2,151.55.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 19.36 at 2,702.64. The Ibis DAX index closed up 0.96 at 2,705.21 points in post bourse trading.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold finished at $380.15 compared with Friday's close of $380.45.</p>
