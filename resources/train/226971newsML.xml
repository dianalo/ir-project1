<p>Wales did their best to spoil David Campese's final test appearance on Sunday but could not prevent Australia completing a clean sweep of international victories on their tour of Europe.</p>
<p>The Wallabies won 28-19 at Cardiff Arms Park, weathering a second-half fightback from the home side who trailed 18-6 at half-time before finally clinching victory with a penalty try in the last minute.</p>
<p>Welsh hopes were dramatically re-ignited 13 minutes into the second-half when centre Gareth Thomas intercepted a pass from George Gregan and raced 90 metres to score under the Wallaby posts to bring his side within two points.</p>
<p>Jonathan Davies converted and then landed his fourth successful penalty to put Wales 19-18 ahead with 20 minutes left, but the Wallabies deservedly finished on top.</p>
<p>Campese had a quiet match on his 101st and final appearance as Australian full-back Matthew Burke completed a personal haul of 18 points. In the process he established a world record for the highest test aggregate scored by one player in a calendar year.</p>
