<headline>Russia and the G7 - is Boris in or out?.</headline>
<dateline>DENVER 1997-06-21</dateline>

<p>Well, is it the Group of Seven plus one, the Group of Eight, the Summit of the Eight? The summit of 10? or what?</p>
<p>If you listen to President Bill Clinton you would believe the exclusive club of industrialised countries meeting in Denver has accepted Russia as a full member alongside regular G7 partners the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.</p>
<p>Clinton embraced his good friend Boris Yeltsin and placed him at his right hand for the summit's closed sessions, referring openly to the &quot;Group of Eight&quot;.</p>
<p>Eager to reward Yeltsin for his acceptance of NATO expansion into eastern Europe and his commitment to reforms, Clinton declared Russia's leader was joining in &quot;for the first time from the beginning to the end&quot; of the annual summit.</p>
<p>This ignored the fact that Russia was not invited to attend Saturday afternoon's session on financial policy, which used to be at the core of G7 business but has taken second place to political issues in recent meetings.</p>
<p>Japan's spokesman said that Russia, whose economy is in a shambles after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was &quot;not ready&quot; to join discussions on issues like finance and macro-economic policy.</p>
<p>The French said there was &quot;no consensus&quot; for full Russian membership.</p>
<p>Britain, host of next year's summit, declined to be specific about Russia's status for that meeting. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook avoided a direct answer when quizzed by reporters, saying only that Britain was happy at Russia's expanding role in the group.</p>
<p>Purists, of course, note that even in Denver there are actually 10 people sitting at the big round wooden table in Denver's public library.</p>
<p>The national leaders are also joined by Netherlands Prime Minister Wim Kok, current president of the European Union, and Jacques Santer, president of the EU's executive body, the European Commission.</p>
