<headline>Cyprus bourse rebounds after lows.</headline>
<dateline>NICOSIA 1997-02-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Cyprus stock exchange rebounded to gain 3.48 percent in the first three trading days of the week in an upturn sparked by bargain hunters and government pledges to help the bourse, analysts said.</p>
<p>But news of an 11 million pound ($22.4 million) government package to boost industrial exports and promote tourism came too late on Wednesday to affect trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The indices fell to very low levels in recent days and consequently the prices were attractive to investors who started buying,&quot; said Theodoulos Charalambides, manager of Laiki Investments.</p>
<p>The 41-share general index closed at 76.86 points on Wednesday from 74.27 last Friday.</p>
<p>Last Thursday the market closed at 73.90, its lowest level since the market started official transactions in March last year.</p>
<p>Market analysts said the bourse responded positively to remarks by the finance minister last week who said measures were being considered to boost the fledgling exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a positive response to the minister's statements and, for the optimists (there are) expectations of an initiative on Cyprus,&quot; Charalambides added, referring to a widely-expected international initiative to reunite the militarily-divided island.</p>
<p>Bourse officials and the finance ministry had put the market's overall decline down to a correction of inflated prices which prevailed in unofficial trading some months prior to the official launch.</p>
<p>Some brokers disagreed, saying investors over-reacted to the negative political climate after Turkish threats of a military strike to destroy surface-to-air missiles which Cyprus is negotiating to buy from Russia.</p>
<p>Under the new regulations announced last week, 30 percent of investments in new companies listing on the exchange will be tax deductible and tax exemptions will be allowed on the first 1200 pounds ($2,400) paid in dividends.</p>
<p>Banking stocks closed on Wednesday at 87.08 points, gaining 3.06 percent from Friday's close.  Bank of Cyprus fully paid shares gained 13.5 cents to close at 328 on Wednesday, while the Cyprus Popular Bank closed at 311.5, up four cents from Friday.</p>
<p>Hellenic Bank  recouped last week's losses and closed at 261.5, up 11 cents. The Universal Life Savings Bank saw gains of 14.5 cents, closing at 155.5</p>
<p>The approved investment sub index, which lost 10 percent last week, gained 8.9 percent in the first three days of the week. Its general index closed at 67.86 from 62.27 last week.</p>
<p>Hera Portfolio shares closed at 121 on Wednesday from 115 on Friday, while the mid trading price for Cytrustees was 136 on Wednesday, up 10.5 cents.</p>
<p>Insurance company Universal Life slipped half a cent to close at 397. Paneuropean was trading at 106.5 from 99 cents on Friday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Paneuropean announced that it has increased its stake in Liberty Life insurance to 27.49 percent of its capital. Liberty shares closed at 106 from 100 last week.</p>
<p>Cement producer Vassiliko was trading at 145.5 from 139 on Friday. Beer and wine producer Keo was up two cents at 106.</p>
<p>National carrier Cyprus Airways was trading at 32.8 cents from 32.5 last week.</p>
