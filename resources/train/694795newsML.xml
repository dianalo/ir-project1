<p>A dozen African heads of state are expected in the Democratic Republic of Congo to celebrate on Monday the first Independence Day festivities with Laurent Kabila as president.</p>
<p>But the celebrations could be marred by anti-government protests after an opposition leader called a march in defiance of Kabila's blanket ban on political activity in the former Zaire.</p>
<p>Sources at the presidency said Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Burundi's Pierre Buyoya and Ange Felix Patasse of the Central African Republic arrived in the capital Kinshasa on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Details of Monday's celebration are not available yet, but it will be for the first time in several years that the country will celebrate the Independence Day with great pride,&quot; state radio said.</p>
<p>But the sources said that a military parade would take place in the Chinese-built Kamanyola stadium, capped with a rare nationwide address by Kabila.</p>
<p>Africa's third-largest country gained independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960.</p>
<p>Ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, who ruled single-handedly from 1965 to May this year, long downplayed independence day.</p>
<p>He changed the Congo's name to Zaire in 1971, but Kabila has changed it back.</p>
<p>Kabila toppled Mobutu last month after a seven-month military campaign. He has proclaimed himself president with sweeping powers.</p>
<p>The opposition said it would defy his rule on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will demonstrate peacefully to protest against the way Kabila is driving us. We are against liberation without liberty and numerous human rights violations,&quot; opposition leader Joseph Olenghankoy told Reuters.</p>
<p>A communique read out on state television warned that &quot;severe measures&quot; would be taken against anyone joining the anti-government march.</p>
<p>&quot;Students don't have to let themselves be manipulated by the enemies of the people,&quot; the communique from &quot;the Congolese authorities&quot; said.</p>
<p>Number one opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi was briefly detained on Thursday, following a speech he made before a crowd of thousands of students at Kinshasa University.</p>
<p>His supporters burned cars in the capital Kinshasa and ransacked gas stations in response.</p>
<p>Kabila's soldiers have broken up demonstrations, sometimes firing without warning.</p>
