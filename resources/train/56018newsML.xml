<headline>Troy, NY calls on council to approve restructuring.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-16</dateline>

<p>The mayor of Troy, N.Y., which a rating agency said was at risk of default, said Monday the city reached a pact with its three bondholders, and called upon the city council to quickly approve it.</p>
<p>Mayor Mark Pattison, saying the restructuring plan would save the city $11 million, added that its annual debt service would not exceed $6 million.</p>
<p>The three bondholders, Oppenheimer Fund, the Franklin Fund and Van Kampen Fund, agreed to waive the $1.4 million lease revenue payment that was due on September 15, he added.  </p>
<p>Troy, which has a population of about 55,000, in July had a total of around $90 million of long-term debt outstanding. The city has been under considerable pressure to refinance the high-interest bearing debt it had issued.</p>
<p>For example, the Sept 15 lease revenue payment was due on about $35 million of debt that was issued in 1992, which paid 8.8 percent interest due to the deal's unusual structure.</p>
<p>Troy since 1995 has been subject to a state-imposed Municipal Assistance Corp, which handles its debt offerings, as it has been unable to sell its debt on its own.  </p>
<p>Municipal Assistance Corp is expected to be used to issue new debt that could be used as a substitute for the $35 million of debt that now is owned by the three mutual funds.</p>
<p>The mayor, noting he has been working since January to &quot;pull us back from the fiscal brink,&quot; added that when adjusted for inflation, the $11 million in savings the city expects to reap in lower interest payments over the current term of the bonds balloons to $25 million when adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>During the next three years, a period he termed as possible the most important for the city's financial recovery, Troy stands to save almost $4 million in annual debt service.  </p>
<p>Pattison urged the city council president hold a meeting of the finance committee as soon as possible. The council recently agreed to other provisions, including borrowing $6 million to create a debt reserve, which it initially had rejected.</p>
<p>While the new restructuring pact furthers Troy's progress toward financial recovery, the mayor made it plain that its high debt burden had forced it to put off needed improvements and other spending.</p>
<p>&quot;There are years of deferred maintenance to our streets, buildings, and parks that need to be undertaken,&quot; he said, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>Noting the city must rebuild its fleets of vehicles, he added reserves for self-insurance, judgment and claims, healthcare and workers' compensation all need to be replenished.</p>
