<p>Indian call money was quoted in the 0.25-0.75 percent range in early Tuesday trade unchanged from Monday's close as good liquidity and poor demand persisted, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the call money market remained easy as funds supply with banks was good.</p>
<p>Call money rates have been at the current level for the last three weeks as banks are flush with funds.</p>
<p>A state government loan auction on Wednesday could drain some lqiudity away from banks and push rates up slightly, some dealers said.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) auctions 25 billion rupees of 13.05 percent 10-year state government bonds on April 30 and dealers expect bids to exceed the target amount.</p>
<p>&quot;We think there will be bids for about 50 billion rupees, given the current liquidity and we expect the RBI to accept bids for about 40 billion,&quot; said a dealer at a state-run bank.</p>
<p>&quot;This may push rates up a bit but we don't see them going up much beyond 2.0 percent as liquidity remains good,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected trade in government securities to remain on a low key on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's auction.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices will be largely steady in moderate trade today,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Market players will take positions after the auction tomorrow.&quot;</p>
