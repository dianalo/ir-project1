<p>The mine manager of Tsumeb Corp Ltd (TCL) in Namibia, trapped in his home by striking copper miners since Tuesday morning, told Reuters he and his wife were preparing to spend the night as hostages.</p>
<p>Mine manager Tony de Beer, speaking by telephone from his beseiged house, said armed strikers from the Mineworkers' Union of Namibia (MUN) were standing outside his property.</p>
<p>&quot;There are strikers standing at the gate. They are all armed. Maybe I can leave, maybe not, but I don't feel like getting walloped over the head,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mediation efforts to halt the increasingly bitter strike -- over wage increases and now entering its sixth week -- broke down last Thursday and violent protest flared over the weekend injuring eight people in clashes between strikers and police.</p>
<p>Late on Monday strikers at Tsumeb -- owned by Gold Fields of Namibia Ltd -- tried to gain entry to de Beer's property, but police forced the strikers away.</p>
<p>A Gold Fields spokesman confirmed that de Beer also fired a warning shot over the strikers' heads to scare them off. &quot;There was a shot fired. Nobody was injured,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>But the strikers returned early Tuesday.</p>
<p>Strikers also occupied a hospital on Monday which has now been shut down. They also now control all three copper mines at the site --  Tsumeb, Kombat and Otjihase.</p>
<p>De Beer said the strikers appeared in total control of the operations and were heavily armed. &quot;They have got shot-guns, pangas (long knives), knobkerries (clubs) and whips,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Gold Fields' spokesman described the current situation at the three mines as &quot;calm but very tense.&quot;</p>
<p>A new pay offer is to be put forward by Friday aimed at settling the dispute or, at least, starting mediation again. </p>
<p>&quot;We are working on a proposal to offer them by the end of the week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The strike over pay began with TCL offering a seven percent rise and the union wanting 14.5 percent.</p>
<p>But the spokesman warned that the damage caused by the strike meant any new offer was unlikely to be as high as seven percent unless job losses were included in the package. &quot;We are back to where we started when the strike began,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tsumeb mines and smelters have been shut down since August 23 when MUN members began to strike.</p>
<p>The strike is costing TCL some 80 tonnes a day in lost copper production and a similar amount in lost lead.</p>
<p>TCL produced just under 30,000 tonnes of blister copper last year and 27,000 tonnes of lead. Most of the lead was produced from bought-in material while copper output was from TCL mines.</p>
