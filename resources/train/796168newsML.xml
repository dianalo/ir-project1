<p>Import growth will far outstrip exports in Poland during 1997, widening both the current account and trade deficits to worrying levels, a senior government analyst said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Zbigniew Kuzmiuk, head of the Centre for Stratgic Studies told reporters Poland's current account gap was likely to reach $6.5 billion or five percent of gross domestic product in 1997.</p>
<p>This compared with a deficit of $1.35 billion, which was one percent of GDP, in 1996.</p>
<p>The trade deficit was also likely to expand to $13 billion against the government's 1997 budget estimate of $9.5 billion, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a worrying figure,&quot; Kuzmiuk said.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth rate of imports is still much faster than that of exports even though European Union countries, our main export market, are just coming out of recession,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Polish imports surged 24.9 percent in the first half of 1997 against the same period of last year to $18.18 billion, while exports rose just 9.2 percent to $12.46 billion. This brought the trade gap to $5.72 billion against a $3.15 billion gap in the whole of 1996.</p>
<p>Kuzmiuk said that despite the trend so far, he expected a marked improvement this year in the pace of export growth, while imports would slow down compared with 1996.</p>
<p>An improved business climate in the European Union and export opportunities in the East would allow exports to grow by 11 percent in 1997 as a whole, while imports increase by 23 percent, he said.</p>
<p>This compares with 6.7 percent in export and 31.9 percent in import growth during 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The slightly faster exports growth and slower imports are also likely to be a result of the recent weakening of the zloty,&quot; Kuzmiuk said.</p>
<p>Floods in July which caused billions of dollars worth of damage, prompted large-scale zloty sales by foreign investors who were concerned that flood relief spending would worsen Polish fundamentals.</p>
<p>Investors were especially concerned about the 2.5 billion zloty flood relief credit which parliament imposed on the independent central bank, saying it was the worst possible way to finance from the point of view of inflation.</p>
<p>The large government loan, coupled with a money supply jump of 4.1 percent in July, prompted the National Bank of Poland to raise its main interest rates by two and 2.5 percentage points to 27 and 24.5 percent respectively on August 4.</p>
<p>&quot;The 4.1 percent jump in July means money supply growth is out of the NBP's control and further tightening is needed with post-flood credit outflows still ahead,&quot; Krzysztof Rybinski, chief economist at ING Bank in Warsaw, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Credit for households and companies rose 32 percent and 17.2 percent respectively between the start of the year and the end of July. Household deposits rose by 22.4 percent while company deposits fell 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rise in interest rates may not be enough to curb credit growth because real wages were still rising while consumer optimism was buoyant. This meant the pace of import growth was unlikely to slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is not with exports but with excessive growth of imports as consumer optimism is around record highs ahead of the elections,&quot; Rybinski said. Poland is to hold parliamentary polls on September 21.</p>
<p>Kuzmiuk said the declining tendency to save and rising propensity to spend -- especially on high quality imported goods such as new cars -- was a result of an explosion of long constrained demand and optimism about future wage growth.</p>
<p>Gross real wages in the enterprise sector have grown 5.1 percent in the first half of the year against the same period of last year and the CSS expects that although their growth will slow down only slightly in the comming months.</p>
