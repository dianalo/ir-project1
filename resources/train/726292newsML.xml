<p>American tobacco companies lied and cheated for decades to protect their profits against a tidal wave of medical research linking cigarette smoke with cancer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said at the start of a landmark secondhand-smoke trial on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;'We need more research.' That's the same song they sang 43 years ago and still sing today,&quot; said Stanley Rosenblatt, a lawyer for 60,000 non-smoking airline flight attendants who are suing tobacco companies for $5 billion, saying they were injured by passengers' cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt said during opening statements at the trial of Norma Broin et al vs. Philip Morris Inc. et al that he would call two former U.S. surgeons general to testify that tobacco industry operatives blunted and denigrated medical and government reports on the dangers of smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence will show that profits were their paramount concern, not the health of the American people,&quot; Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>Displaying a 1954 tobacco advertisement published in nearly 500 newspapers, Rosenblatt told the jury of two women and four men that the companies lied, misled, obfuscated and conspired to keep alive doubts in smokers' minds about the research connecting cigarette smoke to lung cancer, heart disease and other ailments,</p>
<p>&quot;The strategy was to knock, to cricitize, to plant doubt in the minds of the American people,&quot; Rosenblatt said. &quot;They had a duty not to lie, not to mislead, not to misrepresent.&quot;</p>
<p>The advertisement, published after widely publicized experiments on mice indicated a link between cigarette tar and cancer, was the first volley in an industry misinformation campaign that was still alive during his questioning of tobacco company chief executives last April, Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt said the chief executives, whose videotaped answers will be presented during the trial, all expressed doubts about the links between cancer and smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows that the strategy is still in place,&quot; Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>An executive with one of the defendants, Senior Vice President Dan Donohue of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., dismissed Rosenblatt's charges of decades of industry lies. &quot;We've heard that same refrain before ... in every smokers trial,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt has no evidence that the flight attendants had any higher rate of tobacco-related illnesses than the general population, Donohue said. &quot;The evidence does not allow you to conclude that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke by non-smoker causes disease,&quot; the executive said.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies' lawyers, filling two defense tables and spilling over into the hardwood spectator seats in Dade County Court, repeatedly interrupted Rosenblatt's impassioned presentation, saying he was often expressing opinions when he was allowed to make only factual statements.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt complained the defense lawyers were trying to distract the jurors</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, objections are tactical,&quot; Rosenblatt said after an objection from an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. was upheld by Dade County Circuit Judge Robert Kaye.</p>
<p>&quot;Objection!&quot; yelled several of the lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't interrupt them as much,&quot; Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>&quot;Objection,&quot; the tobacco lawyers said.</p>
<p>A trial consultant, lawyer Melissa Ronan, said the interruptions hurt Rosenblatt but that he appeared to be reaching at least several of the jurors during the 2-1/2 hours he spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;They were catching the high points of his presentation. Several were taking lots of notes,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Philip Morris Cos. Inc., Reynolds, Liggett Group Inc. and Brown &amp; Williamson were scheduled to make their opening statements on Tuesday, with testimony to begin on Wednesday and expected to last into September or longer.</p>
<p>Much of the testimony is expected to turn on the science of secondhand smoke, generally regarded as less developed than the research on smoking and disease. Rosenblatt said he would call chemists, physicians and researchers to bolster his claims.</p>
<p>The jury will then decide the unprecedented class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of the estimated 60,000 flight attendants with tobacco-related illnesses such as lung cancer.</p>
<p>All were non-smokers and say their ailments were caused by passengers' cigarette smoke aboard U.S. passenger jets before 1988.</p>
<p>The case is both the first secondhand-smoke case and the first class-action lawsuit against the U.S. tobacco industry to come to trial.</p>
