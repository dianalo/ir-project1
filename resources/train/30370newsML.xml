<p>The United States said on Monday that Iraqi troops appeared to be moving deeper into Kurdish opposition-held territory in northern Iraq, and President Bill Clinton readied a &quot;course of action&quot; in response.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry, speaking with reporters as the president campaigned in Wisconsin, said there was evidence that some of the Iraqi forces that overran the Kurdish stronghold of Arbil over the weekend were &quot;penetrating deeper&quot; into northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Iraqi military advance threatened the town of Sulaymaniyah, the administrative capital of the Kurdish opposition, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was, you know, some discussions about redeploying his units outside the town of Arbil. Some of that did happen although they remained in firm control of the area. There is other evidence that he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) is using some of that force to penetrate deeper into Kurdish-occupied territories in northern Iraq,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>McCurry said there was also &quot;reason to believe&quot; that some Iraqi troops were involved in executions of leaders of an anti-Baghdad Kurdish faction in Arbil.</p>
<p>Clinton, who placed U.S. forces in the Gulf region on high alert on Saturday when the crisis blossomed, had defined &quot;a course of action and has been consulting some governments and informing some governments of that course of action,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>Although there were reports that Clinton had signed off on military action, McCurry refused to confirm this, saying &quot;clearly political, economic and military aspects have been under consideration.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1993 Clinton launched a cruise missile attack on Iraq in response to its alleged plot to assassinate former President George Bush while Bush was visiting Kuwait that year.</p>
<p>The missiles destroyed an Iraqi intelligence headquarters in central Baghdad where U.S. officials said the plot had been hatched.</p>
<p>CNN, citing a Pentagon source, reported on Monday that U.S. Air Force B-52 bombers carrying cruise missiles had taken off from Guam, but it was unknown if they were headed for Iraq.</p>
<p>Asked about the report, McCurry noted that B-52s were long-range aircraft, adding: &quot;I don't know that that would be particularly significant.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton made no mention of the crisis in his Labour Day speeches, but after addressing a crowd of about 25,000 in the Green Bay suburb of De Pere, he went to a house trailer set up near the podium as a temporary headquarters and telephoned French President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a useful, productive and candidate discussion of the situation in northern Iraq,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>Clinton also conferred twice by telephone with White House chief of staff Leon Panetta and National Security Adviser Tony Lake, who were both back in Washington following the fast-breaking situation.</p>
<p>The White House believes Saddam sent three tank divisions composed of 30,000-40,000 elite Republican Guard troops into northern Iraq to help a Kurdish faction involved in a bloody power struggle with another Kurdish group with links to Iran.</p>
<p>It says U.N. Security Council resolutions approved after the 1991 Gulf War provide the legal basis for responding to Saddam's actions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our interest is in keeping Saddam Hussein from believing that unjustifiable behaviour of this nature is cost-free,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>He added that every time Saddam &quot;has miscalculated and believed that he could use his military power with impunity, the international community has reminded him that he has obligations in the aftermath of his defeat in the Persian Gulf War.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the timing of a possible U.S. strike on Iraq, McCurry said &quot;I'm not going to speculate on that.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton's Republican challenger in the November presidential election Bob Dole made no public comment on the Iraq situation at a campaign rally in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>But asked by reporters later if he agreed that U.S. military action was likely, Dole replied: &quot;Yeah. Weak leadership. We probably shouldn't have to be doing what we are doing.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole, who has criticised Clinton's handling of Saddam Hussein and assailed his Middle East policy in general, will address the American Legion on Tuesday and was expected to launch another broad attack on the president's foreign policy.</p>
