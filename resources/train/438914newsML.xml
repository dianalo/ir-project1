<p>Canadian National Railway Co, Canada's largest freight railway, on Thursday criticized the swift breakup of Conrail Inc.</p>
<p>CN officials said in a brief prepared for a hearing of the New York Department of Transportation that New York State would be significantly disadvantaged if the break-up of Conrail moves forward in the form now predicted.</p>
<p>Gerald Davies, CN's senior vice-president of marketing said rail competition is denied from the north and seriously limited from the west by the dismemberment of Conrail as planned by Norfolk Southern Corp and CSX Corp.  </p>
<p>Davies said Conrail was created on the assumption that the state's economy could not support Class 1 rail competition.</p>
<p>&quot;Evidence that such is not currently the case is the price that Norfolk and CSX are prepared to pay for Conrail,&quot; he said. The transaction is far more complex than appears and any &quot;rush to bless it should be resisted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Michael Sabia, CN chief financial officer, said the lack of competitive access for railroads operating on New York's western and northern borders mirrors the extraordinary market dominance which Conrail currently enjoys and threatens the future viability of key New York rail lines.  </p>
<p>The future of the Massena line linking Montreal and Syracuse and the 100 jobs it supports is placed in doubt by the CSX-Norfolk proposal, Sabia said.</p>
<p>The &quot;Southern Tier&quot; route also had a &quot;future difficult to imagine&quot; given that Norfolk Southern &quot;will likely concentrate its traffic on the Pennsylvania line, depriving the Southern Tier of a consistent volume of freight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sabia said CN was prepared to financially participate &quot;through ownership, co-ownership, access arrangements, or other mechanisms in establishing and maintaining a high quality rail system capable of providing competition for New York from the north and the west.&quot;</p>
<p>He said CN is proposing the establishment of a &quot;New York Network&quot; based on three core components: a network of existing routes, the substantial broadening of access for competing railroads at the all-important Buffalo gateway, and effective alliances with shortline railroads.</p>
