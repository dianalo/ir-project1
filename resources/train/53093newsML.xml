<title>JAPAN: Two US Marines held on assault charges in Okinawa.</title>

<p>Two U.S. servicemen were being held by U.S. authorities on suspicion of assaulting and robbing a female bar owner in Okinawa, police said on Friday.</p>
<p>The latest incident comes in the wake of a nonbinding prefectural referendum in which a majority of people voted for a reduction of U.S. bases on the island. Crimes involving U.S. servicemen have led to growing opposition to U.S. military bases in Japan.</p>
<p>U.S. military authorities identified the two suspects as Jeremy Wright and Brian Bergen, both Marine corporals stationed at Camp Hansen in Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa.</p>
<p>The two allegedly entered a bar owned by Toshiko Gakiya, 56, on Wednesday and after having had a few drinks, assaulted her and stole her purse which contained 7,000 yen ($63), an Okinawa prefectural police spokesman said.</p>
<p>The two U.S. servicemen have been placed in pre-trial confinement in Camp Hansen, the U.S. Marine Public Affairs Office said in a statement released late on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still discussing whether to ask for the custody of the two suspects, but this is a very delicate problem,&quot; the Okinawa police spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>In the most recent high-profile case, three U.S. servicemen were jailed earlier this year for raping an Okinawan girl.</p>
<p>That crime has led to a huge public outcry against U.S. bases in Okinawa.</p>
<p>The island, some 1,000 km (625 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is home to three-quarters of the U.S. military facilities in Japan and hosts about half of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in the country, although it constitutes less than one percent of Japan's total land area.</p>
<p>Okinawa governor Masahide Ota and the central government have been at odds over the renewal of land lease contracts for U.S. military facilities. ($1=110 yen)</p>
