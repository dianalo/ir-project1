<headline>India Yadav to surrender on Wednesday - legal aide.</headline>
<dateline>PATNA, India 1997-07-29</dateline>

<p>Former Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav will surrender before a special court on Wednesday following the Indian Supreme Court's rejection of his appeal to avoid arrest in a corruption case, a legal aide said.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow morning, Yadav will surrender in the court of S.K. Lal, special CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) judge,&quot; advocate-general Ganga Prasad Rai, a legal advisor to the Bihar government, told Reuters in the state capital of Patna.  </p>
<p>Rai said Yadav was expected to surrender at 10 a.m. (0430 GMT), and added that the CBI, the federal investigating agency, cannot arrest him on Tuesday night as the arrest warrant in his case cannot be executed after sunset.</p>
<p>Yadav resigned as chief minister of Bihar on Friday after the CBI court issued a warrant following the Patna high court's rejection of his appeal for &quot;anticipatory bail,&quot; allowed under Indian law to people expecting possible arrest.</p>
<p>Yadav then approached the Supreme Court, India's highest court, to appeal against the high court ruling. The CBI ordered his arrest on Tuesday after the Supreme Court affirmed the high court order.</p>
<p>Yadav denies charges in the $280-million scandal involving alleged embezzlement of state animal welfare funds.</p>
<p>Until Friday, he rejected calls for resignation from opposition members and allies. After resigning he immediately named his wife Rabri Devi, a political novice who has all along been a housewife, as his successor.</p>
<p>Yadav's intransigence had rattled Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's United Front coalition, whose leaders decided on Friday not to admit in its fold Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party, after weeks of vacillation on his group's status.</p>
<p>Yadav formed his RJD by breaking Gujral's Janata Dal party on July 5 over differences linked to leadership elections.</p>
