<p>Chinese dissident Chen Longde, who attempted suicide in August by jumping from a third-floor window, has been sent back to a labour camp, family members said on Monday.</p>
<p>Chen's family has received police notification that the dissident was discharged from hospital on November 28 and sent to a labour camp in Jinhua city in the eastern province of Zhejiang, his 74-year-old mother, Ren Yueqin, said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm really worried. He (Chen) is ill. His leg is not yet fully recovered,&quot; Ren told Reuters by telephone from Hangzhou, capital of the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Chen broke his right leg and smashed three teeth after jumping out of the window because he could not stand alleged beating by prison officials, family members have said.</p>
<p>The prison denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;He is still using crutches... It still hurts when he walks,&quot; his sister said by telephone. &quot;We requested that he be released on bail but they (authorities) refused.&quot;</p>
<p>The mother said she begged to be allowed to meet the dissident but police refused her request.</p>
<p>Chen, 39, was detained last May and ordered two months later to serve three years in a labour camp for &quot;endangering national security&quot; by sending a petition to parliament demanding the release of political prisoners.</p>
<p>He was previously jailed for three years for his role in student-led demonstrations crushed by the army on June 4, 1989, in Beijing.</p>
