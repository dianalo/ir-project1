<p>Beazer Homes USA Inc, reporting sharply lower second quarter profits even before a big writedown, said Wednesday it expects improved second half earnings per share on fewer shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The writedown left the company with a loss of $0.54 per share for the second quarter, ended March 31, compared to a profit of $0.41 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The previously announced writedown of two properties in Nevada amounted to $0.60 per share.  </p>
<p>President Ian McCarthy said, &quot;Both the net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 1997, and the reduced earnings before the writedown, result principally from issues associated with our Nevada operations, issues which we now feel are behind us.&quot;</p>
<p>With the changes made, &quot;we believe that our Nevada operations, and the company as a whole, will begin to experience improved results in future quarters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company said it had 1,534 new orders in the latest quarter, down 10.1 percent from a year ago.  </p>
<p>McCarthy said, &quot;The reduction in our new orders during the quarter resulted principally from comparison to an extremely strong quarter in the prior year, when new orders were up 48 percent compared to the year-earlier period. In the upcoming June quarter the comparison becomes much easier.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;In April we have been experiencing positive new order comparisons relative to last year, a trend which we are optimistic about continuing for the remainder of the June quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer David Weiss said the company has repurchased over 400,000 shares since March 31 at prices averaging about $13.25 per share. &quot;This brings the total number of shares purchased under our previously announced stock repurchase program to over 500,000.&quot;</p>
<p>McCarthy concluded, &quot;Although we are disappointed with the loss that we have reported for the quarter...we are optimistic about our results for the second half of fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;With our issues behind us in Nevada, the opening of a number of new subdivisions and the repurchase of a significant number of shares at prices below book value, we believe that, absent adverse economic changes, earnings per share for the second half of 1997 should surpass the second half of 1996.&quot;</p>
