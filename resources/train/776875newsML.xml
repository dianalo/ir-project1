<p>Lebanon's weekly treasury bill issue of July 31 raised 320.9 billion Lebanese pounds, according to finance ministry results issued on Monday.</p>
<p>The previous issue raised 354.5 billion pounds.</p>
<p>The issue posted a nominal deficit of subscription against maturity of 76.2 billion pounds for the third consecutive week. The July 24 issue had posted a nominal deficit of 33.9 billion pounds.</p>
<p>Banking sources said the results of the August 7 auction, which will be announced next week, would show a shrinking deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The July 30 issue marked the peak of the deficit crisis. In the results of next auction, we will see a reduction of deficit which will lead to a reversal of the (deficit) trend,&quot; a banking source said.</p>
<p>He said the central bank was a net buyer on the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>The July 31 issue raised the following amounts (in billion of pounds, previous week in brackets):</p>
<p>    Term			  Yield		    Amount</p>
<p>    Three months	    13.16 (13.18)	    54.4  (46.4)</p>
<p>    Six months		14.02 (14.03)	   197.9 (106.5)</p>
<p>    12 months		 15.20 (15.20)	    40.5  (91.7)</p>
<p>    24 months		 16.08 (16.08)	    28.1 (109.9)</p>
<p>The central bank said 10 percent of all competitive bids -- those made by Lebanese institutions -- were accepted up to the discount rate and yield for three-month bills and 50 percent for the six-month bills.</p>
<p>It also restricted the acceptance of non-competitive bids -- those made by private individuals and foreign investors -- for the shorter-term bills, approving 10 percent up to the discount rate and yield for three-month bills and 50 percent for six-month bills.</p>
<p>All competitive and non-competitive bids were approved for one-year and two-year bills.</p>
<p>The Lebanese pound closed at 1,537.25 to the U.S. dollar on Monday from 1,537.75 a week earlier and 1,566 a year ago.</p>
