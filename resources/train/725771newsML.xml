<title>CAMBODIA: Taiwanese accused of arms role in Cambodia.</title>

<p>Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on Monday accused unidentified Taiwanese, including a general, of involvement in this month's fighting in Phnom Penh, prompting sharp denials from Taipei.</p>
<p>&quot;A group of Taiwanese mafia arrived in Cambodia. The day there was fighting happening, the Taiwanese were there,&quot; he said in a speech to villagers in Kompong Thom province north of the capital.</p>
<p>Hun Sen was referring to fighting in Phnom Penh on July 5 and 6 when he ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly speaking there was a two-star general there. Now he is hiding in Phnom Penh. We have evidence these Taiwanese gave money to buy weapons,&quot; he said. &quot;I accuse the Taiwanese completely.&quot;</p>
<p>Hun Sen said Cambodia could cooperate with Thailand and Vietnam to arrest the Taiwanese people. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Taiwan's foreign ministry on Monday denied any government involvement.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will not involve itself in the internal politics of any foreign country,&quot; Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu told reporters in Taipei.</p>
<p>Taiwan's defence ministry denied the presence of the two-star general. &quot;There was absolutely no such thing,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>An official at Taiwan's trade office in Phnom Penh, which represents the Taiwan government in Cambodia, said he was not aware that any Taiwan people were involved in Cambodia's political crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;We have never heard of that. We don't do things like that,&quot; said the official who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Cambodia follows a one-China policy, recognising Beijing and not Taiwan, although Taiwan is Cambodia's largest foreign investor.</p>
<p>China has considered Taiwan a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</p>
