<p>King Hussein has told leaders of Jordan's armed forces that the killing of seven Israeli schoolgirls by a Jordanian soldier was alien to their military principles.</p>
<p>&quot;This vile and treacherous act is not part of the morals of our Arab army,&quot; the official news agency Petra quoted him as saying on a visit to army headquarters on Saturday. &quot;We have never been used to such behaviour in our Arab army.&quot;</p>
<p>King Hussein was due to visit Israel on Sunday to pay his condolences to families of the victims.</p>
<p>The king, who has appointed veteran security official Mohammed Kailani to head investigations into the soldier's motives, said Jordan would follow up his findings.</p>
<p>&quot;We must deal with it, either as an individual (act) or if it had consequences and repercussions,&quot; the king said.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials have repeatedly said that the soldier, army driver Sergeant Ahmed Mousa Mustafa al-Daqamsa, acted alone. The Daqamsas are from Jordan's East Bank, whose tribes form the bedrock of King Hussein's army.</p>
