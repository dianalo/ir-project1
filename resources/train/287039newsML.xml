<p>A U.S. peace mediator struggled to seal a deal on Hebron in separate talks on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met Arafat for two hours in self-ruled Gaza and later held talks with Netanyahu in Jerusalem with little sign agreement was imminent on implementing an Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron, in the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Still working,&quot; Ross told reporters as he strode into Netanyahu's office. &quot;We're close but you know you have to resolve everything to have an agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier in Gaza, Ross declined to disclose the sticking points that have held up a deal which less than a week ago had looked set to be signed.</p>
<p>Arafat also would not be drawn into a public discussion of the problems.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still discussing all the details accurately,&quot; the Palestinian leader said in brief remarks to reporters.</p>
<p>Palestinian cabinet minister Nabil Shaath has said the central issue delaying a deal was Israel's refusal to commit itself to a timetable for further West Bank pullbacks after Hebron, as stipulated in previous peace deals.</p>
<p>Israel was to have redeployed its troops in Hebron some 10 months ago under a 1995 interim accord but violence and security concerns have held it up.</p>
<p>It has also missed a September dateline for the first of three pullbacks from rural areas of the West Bank.</p>
<p>If Ross again fails to clinch a Hebron deal, the United States could choose to shift its diplomatic efforts to its home court.</p>
<p>Both Netanyahu and Arafat have received invitations from U.S. President Bill Clinton to visit Washington separately early in the new year, although no precise dates have been set, spokesmen for the Israeli and Palestinian leaders said.</p>
<p>In Hebron on Saturday, dozens of Jewish seminary students bused into the volatile West Bank town for the Sabbath danced in the streets as they headed to prayers. Some 400 Jews live and study in Hebron, home to more than 100,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, an off-duty Jewish soldier shot and wounded seven Palestinians in a Hebron market. The soldier, a religious Jew, said his aim was to scupper a Hebron deal.</p>
<p>About 100 Palestinians, staking their claim to the West Bank, tried to plant trees near a Jewish settlement south of Hebron on Satuday but were stopped by Israeli soldiers, Arab witnesses said.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said on Friday a Hebron agreement was not likely soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the essential points we have not resolved,&quot; said a senior Palestinian official, who did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>Asked if an accord was far off, the official responded: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had said recently that a deal was near on the long-promised handover to Palestinian rule of 80 percent of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israeli officials charged the Palestinians with delaying a Hebron accord.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers sparked Palestinian anger on Friday when they occupied a West Bank hilltop. The settlers agreed to remove the seven mobile homes from the site on Sunday, in exchange for a meeting the same day with Israeli government officials.</p>
