<p>More rain is expected in the Illinois River watershed next week, posing the threat of further flooding in the area, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>Mike Palmerino, senior agricultural meteorologist with Weather Services Corp, said rain-bearing systems were forecast to be moving across the area on Saturday, late Monday into Tuesday and next Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't they are particularly bad systems in terms of snow disrupting livestock transportation but I think they will be continuing to create problems on the Illinois River,&quot; Palmerino said.  </p>
<p>Three stretches of the Illinois River remained closed to navigation Friday due to high water, a U.S. Coast Guard official said. They were closed on Wednesday to protect houses and properaties in low-lying areas.</p>
<p>WSC's Palmerino said he was forecasting about 0.5 to 1.0 inch of rain in the watershed of the Illinois River on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tim Bowden, meteorologist with Weather Express Inc, forecast there would be 0.25 to 0.75 inch Saturday around the Illinois River, then 0.1 to 0.5 inches Monday/Tuesday. The system late next week &quot;doesn't look too strong&quot; he noted.  </p>
<p>&quot;They (the rain systems) are going to keep flooding concerns very very likely next week,&quot; said WSC's Palmerino.</p>
<p>He also noted that if conditions remain wet then concern about corn planting delays may begin to develop.</p>
<p>&quot;As we now turn the calender into March, I think people will start to looking at it in terms of beginning to hold up plantings,&quot; Palmerino said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very early but I think that if this pattern continues and shows no sign of drying up that you will begin to see concern regarding the ability to get the corn crop planted,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Analysts said corn planting in the U.S. Midwest normally takes place around mid-April to mid-May.</p>
