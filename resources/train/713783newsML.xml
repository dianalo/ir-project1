<p>Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels have seized a ship used for ferrying food from the capital Colombo to northern Jaffna and taken it to their northeastern base, navy officials in the north said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels captured the vessel and its crew of 10 while it was some eight km (five miles) off Point Pedro on Jaffna peninsula late on Monday. Initial reports said there was no food on board.</p>
<p>A navy spokesman in Colombo confirmed the ship had been captured, but added further details were awaited.</p>
<p>Initial reports said the ship was now anchored between Chalai and Almapil near Mullaitivu on the northeastern coast, which is under rebel control.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately available.</p>
<p>Food and other essential supplies are taken to Jaffna by air or sea as there is no land route connecting the peninsula with the rest of the island.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 Sri Lankan troops are battling LTTE fighters to open a highway through the northern rebel-held Wanni region towards Jaffna.</p>
<p>But the offensive, which was launched in May, has slowed down following fierce counterattacks by the rebels.</p>
<p>The LTTE rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east, set fire to a refugee ship off the island's northwestern coast last week and took away its nine crew, including two Indonesians.</p>
<p>The Indonesians were released last Friday. The fate of the remaining seven crew of MV Missen was not known.</p>
