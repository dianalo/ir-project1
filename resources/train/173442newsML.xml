<text>
<p>Swiss Bank Corp., Switzerland's third biggest bank, said profit growth slowed in the third quarter as world financial markets calmed but it still expected a substantially higher profit for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;From the present perspective, SBC expects that ordinary group profit after taxes for the 1996 financial year will be some percentage points below original estimates, but still substantially higher than in 1995,&quot; SBC said in its nine-month statement.</p>
<p>The bank group in September had estimated that 1996 ordinary net profit would rise 33 percent to around 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion).</p>
<p>SBC's nine-month statement said net profit after taxes rose 27 percent in the first nine months of 1996, but provided no figures. It also reported a 17 percent rise in nine-month net operating income.</p>
<p>Profits had risen by 34 percent to 722 million francs ($568 million) in the 1996 first half.</p>
