<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shares end higher on inflation hopes.</title>
<headline>Israeli shares end higher on inflation hopes.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-12-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli shares closed higher on Sunday in thin trading on continued hopes for slower inflation and lower interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 0.27 percent, or 0.53 points, to 199.45 on a low all-share turnover of 55 million shekels against 93 million shekels on Thursday, the last day of trading before the Israeli weekend.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index gained 0.20 percent to 209.37.</p>
<p>&quot;The market rose because investors are predicting that in the long run the Bank of Israel will have to lower interest rates because the inflation is declining,&quot; said Amir Eayal at Epsilon Securities.</p>
<p>But, he added: &quot;The rise of the market is meaningless because of the low volume. This is not a real market.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, the central bank announced it was holding interest rates for December at 15.2 percent.</p>
<p>Other traders were more positive about the market's condition. &quot;The market continues to show strength,&quot; said Danniele Finn, head of sales at Batucha Securities and Investment. &quot;The mood is very positive and the technical indicators are positive. Activity was relatively low today because foreign investors were not active.&quot;</p>
<p>She noted that the market moved higher due to speculative activity in Maof contracts on Thursday, the expiry for the November contract. &quot;Investors expected the market to decline today because of profit-taking, yet the market continued rising today,&quot; Finn said.</p>
<p>Bezeq Israel Telecom declined 0.75 percent to 785 after reporting a decline in third-quarter net profit to 149 million shekels from 163.7 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>All three successor companies to Elbit reported third-quarter earnings on Sunday and continued to traded with volatility. The three began trading separately on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on Thursday.</p>
<p>Elbit Ltd was the most active share of the day and plunged 18.0 percent to 2,627 on volume of 3.1 million shekels. It reported a third-quarter net loss of $1.95 million shekels against net loss of $4.3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Elbit Systems, the third most active share, surged 5.25 percent to 2,387 on turnover of 2.7 million shekels The company reported a third-quarter net profit of $3.8 million, down from $6.3 million at the same period last year.</p>
<p>Elbit Medical Imaging fell 2.25 percent to 1,226. It reported a third-quarter net profit of $1.7 million against $1.3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Elite Industries gained 0.25 percent to 1,469 after reporting a third-quarter net profit of 8.7 million shekels, down from 14.3 million shekels a year earlier.</p>
<p>The First International Bank of Israel tumbled 5.0 percent to 35,015, which traders said was due to profit- taking after it rose sharply on Thursday on the back of options speculation.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the second most active share, gained 0.25 percent to 149,628 on turnover of 2.9 million shekels.</p>
