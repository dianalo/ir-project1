<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-01-03</dateline>

<p>Dutch bonds closed firmer on Friday, pushed higher by bargain-hunters buying up small lots.</p>
<p>The 30-year bond ended up 50 basis points at 110.69/89, while the shorter end moved seven basis points higher to 104.08/16.</p>
<p>While some players have returned to the market after the Christmas/New Year break, prices remain volatile in relatively thin volumes and players still appear to be settling on their strategies, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Prices can move up and down 20-30 points during intra-day trading, but I can't give a fundamental direction to these deals,&quot; one said, adding that the market was closely watching U.S. movements, hoping to pick up possible new trends.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatile and nervous, Dutch bonds might show a slight rise until the U.S. hikes its (interest) rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers noticed some switching out of Jan 2006 bonds into the 8.25 pct Feb 2007s, which some see as the new Dutch 10-year benchmark.  </p>
<p>Others think it's too early to indicate a new benchmark, and prefer to wait until the finance ministry details a new bond issue on January 17.</p>
<p>The widening of the 10-year spread with Bunds to -13 basis points from -10 prompted some switching into Germany, dealers said. Some saw this continuing next week.</p>
<p>Trade volume is expected to pick up from Monday.</p>
