<p>The International Monetary Fund has postponed the release of a loan to Croatia after the United States complained that Zagreb was not meeting its obligations under the Dayton peace accord, an IMF source said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The source confirmed that discussion on the release of a tranche of a $486 million credit had been delayed from Wednesday until later in the month.</p>
<p>&quot;The board adjourned the meeting and will resume the review at the end of the month,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>It was the second time this month that international organisations had postponed credits to the former Yugoslav republic after U.S. criticism. A $30 million World Bank loan was delayed indefinitely on July 1.</p>
<p>Croatian officials protested that there was no economic justification for the delay, but U.S. officials said the postponement should encourage adherence to the 1995 Dayton plan, which ended the fighting in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not support substantial financial assistance to Croatia until Croatia shows by deed that is is going ahead with the implementation of the Dayton accords,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said, noting that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had already made this position clear.</p>
<p>A Treasury official said the United States had taken the intiative on postponing debate on the IMF loan, although other states had backed the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe living up to Dayton is critical, not only for political stability, but also for economic growth and stability in Croatia and the broader area,&quot; he said, speaking on condition he was not identified.</p>
<p>The Croatian central bank said there was no reason to delay the loan.</p>
<p>&quot;The move of the IMF's board of directors is unusual and from the economic point of view inexplicable, particularly since the first review...in May confirmed Croatia was implementing the agreed policies,&quot; the bank said in a statement faxed to Reuters in Zagreb.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, there were no obstacles to continuing with success an exceptionally correct cooperation of this international financial institution with our country.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury official said things had not changed since the World Bank debated its loan to Croatia and made clear that Washington would oppose aid to Croatia until all Dayton obligations were fulfilled.</p>
<p>Asked if the latest vote was an attempt to put pressure on Croatia, he replied: &quot;I think that's a clear characterisation of it.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. officials complained during the debate on the World Bank loan that Zagreb was not doing enough to extradite suspected war criminals or allow the return of refugees displaced by the fighting.</p>
<p>The IMF funding aimed to help Croatia's reform programme. The central bank said the delay would not prompt a change in economic policy and would have no economic consequences.</p>
