<title>FRANCE: French grain dull despite lure of cheaper franc.</title>
<headline>French grain dull despite lure of cheaper franc.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-06-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>French grain markets drifted aimlessly after weekend rain storms, with wheat and barley feeling pressure from the harvest which is now only weeks away.</p>
<p>But business was quiet and even a sharp bump lower in the franc, caused by French qualms over a European budget stability pact, failed to lure northern EU buyers as it normally would.</p>
<p>&quot;We are just blocked at Friday's prices,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Most buyers are covered until the next harvest, leaving less scope for grain to respond to currency volatility caused by wrangling over the conditions for tight budgets after the launch of the single currency, planned for 1999.</p>
<p>French Rouen-delivered new-crop wheat for August was quoted at 880 francs per tonne, which is 887.27 francs for the second half of that month when a carrying charge is included.</p>
<p>Maize edged a little higher, however, on lack of sellers and dealers were posting bids for Rhine material at what had been the market's offered prices on Friday.</p>
<p>Maize for October-December delivery at Bordeaux, in the Southwest, was quoted at 875-880 francs excluding carrying charges. During the past July/June season these were 21.81 francs for the second half of October.  </p>
<p>French Matif wheat: September 874 francs, down one, on volume of 28 lots.</p>
<p>French domestic cash grains are traded on a &quot;July basis,&quot; reflecting their underlying value without the twice-monthly carrying charges which must also be added for delivery periods between August 1 and the end of each July/June crop year.</p>
<p>For 1996/97, the charges are as follows (francs per tonne).</p>
<p>				 1st half	2nd half</p>
<p>    August			3.64	    7.27</p>
<p>    September		  10.91	   14.54</p>
<p>    October		    18.18	   21.81</p>
<p>    November		   25.45	   29.09</p>
<p>    December		   32.72	   36.36</p>
<p>    January		    39.99	   43.63</p>
<p>    February		   47.26	   50.90</p>
<p>    March			54.53	   58.17</p>
<p>    April			61.81	   65.44</p>
<p>    May			  69.08	   72.71</p>
<p>    June			 76.35	   79.98</p>
