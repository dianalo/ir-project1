<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistan's Bhutto expects crackdown on her party.</title>
<headline>Pakistan's Bhutto expects crackdown on her party.</headline>
<dateline>KARACHI, Pakistan 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Pakistan's ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto said on Wednesday she expected a crackdown on her party following a Supreme Court verdict which upheld the dismissal of her government.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't eliminate us politically. They want to eliminate us judicially,&quot; Bhutto told a news conference in Karachi soon after the Supreme Court said President Farooq Leghari was right to dismiss her government on November 5.</p>
<p>&quot;Now they will form false murder charges against me and there would be a mass arrest of our workers.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhutto said the Supreme Court verdict, which cleared the way for national and provincial elections to be held on schedule on Monday, was no surprise.</p>
<p>When the court did not restore her government in five weeks, as it did in a similar case in 1993 following the dismissal of then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, it was clear the decision would go against her, Bhutto said.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew they were going to give the decision against the PPP,&quot; she said of her Pakistan People's Party.</p>
<p>Bhutto accused the Supreme Court of deliberately timing its verdict to influence the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Now President Leghari will come on TV on February 2 saying that we have done our job now you do the needful (what is necessary),&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She also implied the Supreme Court was biased against the Bhutto family.</p>
<p>Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was ousted in a military coup in 1977 and later hanged. The Supreme Court dismissed his wife's petition challenging the imposition of martial law.</p>
<p>&quot;When it is the PPP (dismissed from government), it is right and when it is not the PPP, it's wrong. Dismissing Mr Bhutto is right, dismissing his daughter is right, but dismissing Nawaz Sharif is wrong,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Bhutto said she did not expect fair elections, but would not boycott them.</p>
<p>&quot;If the elections are fair, Nawaz will get 60 seats and we get 90 seats. But no chance of boycott,&quot; she said. &quot;It is necessary to expose the regime.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhutto, whose estranged brother Murtaza was killed last year, accused Leghari of seeking to impose a presidential system of government.</p>
<p>&quot;When my brother was killed on September 20, I knew they would take every extreme step against us,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a timetable according to which Murtaza had to be killed, the Benazir government to be dismissed, a king's party to be made, the PPP to be divided and a presidential form of government to be imposed.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhutto said she expected rigging in some seats, including that being contested by Murtaza's widow, Ghinwa Bhutto.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not accept election results under these federal and provincial governments and President Leghari in the chair,&quot; she said of administrations put in place after her dismissal.</p>
