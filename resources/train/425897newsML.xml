<p>Orange juice in plastic beakers and sandwiches on cardboard trays may not be the most lavish way to round off a city's Olympic bid presentation.</p>
<p>But when the committee promoting Rome's candidacy for the 2004 Games held a lunchtime briefing for foreign journalists recently, the fare on offer seemed to send an entirely fitting message: sober, businesslike and impeccably professional.</p>
<p>In the good old, bad old days before 1992, when magistrates exposed graft as the lubricant of Italian life, a selection of fine wines and a silver service slap-up meal would have been &quot;We never tire of saying that the Olympics must be transparent,&quot; said Raffaele Ranucci, director general of the bid committee Roma 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't afford to make any of the mistakes we think belong to another Italy. Let's finally show that this is a country that can get things done.&quot;</p>
<p>Rome is regarded as the favourite in the race because of its good facilities and organisation. It is also believed to be favoured by the American television network NBC, which this week signed a deal worth more than $2 billion for exclusive US rights to the 2004 and 2008 Summer Games and 2006 Winter Games.</p>
<p>Italy's IOC member and international athletics chief Primo Nebiolo nevertheless played down the city's chances after the shortlist was announbced on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy can be happy now but the hard part lies ahead,&quot; ebiolo said.</p>
<p>Public works -- and the government has pledged $1.7 billion for sports facilities and other building projects if the bid wins -- were a rich seam for corrupt politicians and the Mafia to mine before Italy's Tangentopoli (Bribesville) scandals.</p>
<p>Not only that, but memories are still vivid of grand projects pursued, often at mammoth cost with little return and great delay, for the 1990 World Cup soccer finals in Italy.</p>
<p>Rome received a gleaming new $50 million rail terminal to link the city to its main airport, but in a part of the capital that made no sense. It now lies empty.</p>
<p>The cost of converting Rome's Olympic Stadium for the soccer tournament was almost three times over budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a few years ago the very idea of putting Rome forward for the Olympics would have brought smiles to people's faces in Italy and abroad,&quot; deputy prime minister Walter Veltroni wrote in the Rome newspaper Il Messaggero last October.</p>
<p>&quot;The operation would have seemed fanciful or, worse, suspect,&quot; added Veltroni, the minister responsible for sport.</p>
<p>With a legacy like that, it is no surprise Ranucci portrays the bid as a chance to show the world, and sceptical Italians, that worthwhile projects can be completed honestly, efficiently and to the public's benefit in a new Italy.</p>
<p>Just as the 1960 Games in Rome helped Italy emerge from the hardships of the immediate post-war years, Ranucci hopes a successful bid for the 2004 Olympics will provide the capital with a springboard to resolving some of its deepest problems.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to remain a country which says it's beautiful to have the Colosseum,&quot; he says. &quot;Rome is Rome. We love it. It's beautiful but it's not enough.&quot;</p>
<p>In a country where it is hard to find two people who agree on anything, the bid has generated unaccustomed unity.</p>
<p>Though an environmental lobby opposes the Olympics, Rome's campaign to bring back the Games has the support of the centre-left government, major opposition parties, the city council and the National Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>Rome won high praise for its security plans, its proposed athletes' village and the professionalism of its bid when an IOC evaluation commission visited the city last October.</p>
<p>To ease the Eternal City's traffic problems, the bid committee proposes constructing a third lane along the length of Rome's main ring road which would be reserved throughout the Games to Olympic traffic.</p>
<p>Its blueprint envisages using existing but renovated sports facilities for 30 Olympic venues, with only eight new sites.</p>
<p>&quot;The days when...everything was built from scratch are over. It will have to be done with the utmost severity, without exceptions to the existing rules and in complete transparency,&quot; Veltroni told parliament last year.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get the Games, it will be important to proceed with maximum restraint. The money will be spent on facilities so that they can be used afterwards by the people.&quot;</p>
<p>All the facilities, including the new athletes' village in the eastern suburb of Tor Vergata that would then become a university campus, and existing sites north and south of the centre, would be linked by the ring road.</p>
<p>The Via Veneto, Rome's swankiest boulevard and home to some of the city's top hotels, would be turned into a secure zone for IOC members and other prominent guests.</p>
