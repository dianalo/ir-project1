<p>Southeast Asian currencies, rocked by  weeks of turmoil, firmed on Friday morning as players cashed in some  of their gains on the dollar ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>Dealers said players were reluctant to establish new positions ahead  of the release of Thailand's economic rescue plan, due by August 5,  which is expected to include assistance from the International Monetary  Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody wants to see what the IMF will do in Thailand on the fifth  because that will indirectly affect all the other regional currencies,&quot;  a Singapore-based trader said.</p>
<p>Vague rumours of an impending military coup in Thailand hit New York  markets overnight, causing sales of dollar/baht and a rise in swap  premiums. But the rumours had been around for weeks and little credence  was attached to them, dealers said.</p>
<p>One said there was talk the Bank of Thailand had intervened to sell  the dollar around 32.10 baht in Singapore markets on Friday. No confirmation  was available.</p>
<p>The baht slipped back a notch from morning highs after Standard &amp;  Poor's Corp placed Thailand's &quot;A&quot; long-term foreign currency rating  on creditwatch.</p>
<p>That was further bad news for the Thai economy, implying greater than  expected loan losses in the crisis-torn financial sector.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted at 31.85/31.95 to the dollar onshore at 0435 GMT  against 31.700/9500 late on Thursday. The offshore rate was at 31.80/32.00.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the ringgit showed little immediate reaction to news  Bank Negara Malaysia had asked banks to hold their base lending rates  steady.</p>
<p>Banking sources in Kuala Lumpur said the central bank had asked them  to hold their base lending rates at 9.67 percent despite a recent  spike up in interbank rates.</p>
<p>The ringgit was at 2.6245/95 to the dollar after firming through the  2.63 level earlier on profit-taking in the dollar by funds.</p>
<p>Dealers said the dollar looked firm against the ringgit, but talk  of large orders to sell the dollar at the 2.6400 level was likely  to limit its rise.</p>
<p>The market was awaiting Malaysia's trade data for June, expected next  week, amid talk of a 1.5 billion ringgit deficit after May's surplus  of 157 million ringgit.</p>
<p>The Singapore dollar rose through the key 1.47 level to the U.S. dollar  but dealers said its rise was likely to be capped around 1.4650.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably just profit-taking. I'm still looking at a higher  dollar/Sing,&quot; a dealer said, adding that the market continued to expect  the Sing to drop to around 1.50.</p>
<p>Trade in the Indonesian rupiah was slow, dominated by covering of  short dollar positions for the weekend. Spot rupiah was at 2,605/15  against an opening of 2,613/23.</p>
<p>The Philippine peso was firmer as banks scrambled to meet a deadline  to cut long dollar positions after the central bank slashed the long  dollar limit of banks to five percent of capital from 10 percent,  or 10 million, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Newspapers quoted central bank governor Gabriel Singson as saying  he expected banks to unload $200 million due to the new ruling. The  peso was at 28.960/29.060 against its previous close at 29.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar slipped back from an early high of T$28.590, inspired  by the central bank's move to raise two key interest rates after the  market's close on Thursday.</p>
<p>The central bank raised the rediscount rate to 5.25 percent from 5.00  percent and accomodations against secured loans to 5.625 percent from  5.375 percent, effective from Friday.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong said the rate hikes were aimed  at maintaining stability in the forex market.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar was at T$28.653/660 against Thursday's close at  T$28.70, its weakest finish since 1988.</p>
