<p>American General Corp. said Thursday it will acquire USLife Corp., a rival financial services company with major life insurance operations, for $1.8 billion in stock.</p>
<p>The acquisition comes amid a major consolidation in the life insurance industry and follows weeks of speculation that USLife might be a takeover candidate.</p>
<p>American General said it will pay $49 worth of its own common stock for each share of New York-based USLife.</p>
<p>American General's shares closed Wednesday at $41.50 and USLife at $41.75, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;This merger represents the largest transaction in American General's history and is an outstanding strategic fit which offers a unique opportunity to combine two of the premier providers of life insurance and financial services in the nation,&quot; said American General Chief Executive Rober M. Devlin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Speculation about USLife had grown in recent weeks as Gorden E. Crosby, its chairman for 30 years, neared the end of his term with no chance for re-election unless the board approved an extension in the age limit for directors.</p>
<p>Crosby, 76, who had been known for his steadfast opposition to a takeover of the company, said Thursday, &quot;This is truly an outstanding result for both organisations.&quot;</p>
<p>American General is a diversified financial services company that provides retirement services, consumer loans and life insurance to nine million customers. It had 1996 sales of $10.9 billion. The company has about 15,300 employees.</p>
<p>USLife, also a holding company, has operations in life and health insurance and other financial services. It had 1996 sales of $1.6 billion. The company has about 2,140 employees.</p>
