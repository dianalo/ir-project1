<p>The bellwether one-month Cetes rate fell as expected at Banco de Mexico's auction on Tuesday, reacting to Mexico's key mid-term elections, analysts said.</p>
<p>But concerns about what may happen later this year once the new politicians actually take office could have had a dampening effect on the three- and six-month treasury bills, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We think that with this auction we saw the results of good liquidity tied to post-election euphoria,&quot; said MMS International economist Scott Grimberg.</p>
<p>&quot;Without any doubt it was the result of the election, the fact that it was peaceful, which had a very positive impact on the money market...,&quot; said Santander Investment economist Enrique Ramirez.</p>
<p>The rate on the one-month paper fell 158 basis points to 18.37 percent, roughly in line with expectations. A Reuters survey of nine money market dealers earlier in the day showed an expected decline of 139 basis points on the 28-day Cetes.  </p>
<p>The rate on the three-month paper fell 69 basis points to 18.95 percent, while the rate on the six-month paper fell 16 basis points to 20.40 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said these smaller declines could be tied to concerns over peso vulnerability as the new Congress starts to work and a new multi-sector economic pact to be negotiated later in the year.</p>
<p>Final official data is not in yet, but preliminary results show the PRI has lost its outright majority in the lower house, and will have to negotiate to pass legislation in the Chamber of Deputies.  </p>
<p>The PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas also won the job as Mexico City's new mayor.</p>
<p>The one-year Cetes rate came in at 20.24 percent, compared to 21.16 percent last week, but analysts said this could be tied to sentiment that the economy will keep improving.</p>
<p>&quot;The results were due to optimism that was widespread among investors, both domestic and foreign, due to the election results... and this generated a favourable feeling about economic perspectives,&quot; said Martin Delgado, an analyst with brokerage Value.</p>
<p>The good feeling about the likely results of the election actually started at the treasury bill auction last week, when the rate on 28-day paper fell 95 basis points.</p>
<p>Demand was down sharply this week, however, falling to 8.287 billion pesos, compared to demand of 16.578 billion pesos last week, the central bank said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the falling demand could have been tied to a shift of funds into the stock market, which surged to another record high on Tuesday after rising 1.63 percent.</p>
