<p>Japanese buyers will pick up U.S. soybeans for July shipment this week due to firmer quotes seen on U.S. Gulf/Japan freight rates, traders said on Monday. &quot;End-users returned to the market since last week and are watching the freight cost across the Pacific Ocean,&quot; a soybean trader at a major trade house in Japan said.</p>
<p>Freight rates for nearby shipments on the U.S. Gulf/Japan route for Panamax-sized vessels were quoted at US$21.50 a tonne against around $21.25 last week, traders said.  </p>
<p>Another factor which will determine any further buying from the Japanese will be talks on soymeal prices for the July to September period between crushers and feed makers, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the firmer Chicago market, we're suggesting crushers buy at a quicker pace. But the uncertainty of the soymeal price talks makes them hesitant to buy,&quot; another soybean trader in Japan said.</p>
<p>South Korean buyers of soybean, however, will probably remain inactive this week due to high prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices are too high,&quot; said one trader in Korea, where he said buyer swere waiting for easier prices in the market.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the local soybean market was also awaiting a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report due out later on Monday before deciding which way to move.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers will stay uninterested for the time being if the USDA report proves to be bullish,&quot; the trader said.</p>
