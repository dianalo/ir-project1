<p>Spain's ruling conservatives, unleashing their sharpest attack yet on former Socialist prime minister Felipe Gonzalez, told him on Saturday to face up to his responsibilities for a &quot;dirty war&quot; in the 1980s against Basque rebels and quit as opposition leader.</p>
<p>&quot;He must take the political blame for the things that happened during his term as head of the government,&quot; Fernando Lopez Amor, the deputy spokesman in congress for Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party, told Europa Press news agency.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is considering whether to summon Gonzalez, who was in power from 1982 until May this year, over the 1983-87 campaign of kidnappings, bombings, torture and murder in which 27 people died -- one-third of them by mistake.</p>
<p>Mounting revelations about this campaign waged by the self-styled Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups (GAL) -- a front for security forces and hired gunmen -- eventually forced Gonzalez to call early elections in March which he lost.</p>
<p>The Socialist leader, who remains a formidable candidate for his party despite this and other scandals, asked his followers this week to refrain from answering earlier conservative attacks on him and warned darkly on Friday against fratricidal strife -- an apparent reference to Spain's 1936-39 Civil War.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot slide down the slope of demagogy or of the Cain-like politics in which one tries to liquidate one's contenders,&quot; Gonzalez told a party rally on Friday. &quot;That's behind us, in history. Let us leave it confined to history.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez Amor said the Socialists, who are still struggling against incessant revelations about past corruption scandals, were incapable of providing a proper opposition and that Gonzalez should have stepped down long ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Their leaders have burned themselves out, politically and in terms of vitality, for 14 years...they are incapable not just of recovering the lost ground, but also of providing strategic guidance for a dignified opposition,&quot; Lopez Amor said.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has denied any role in the illegal drive against ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), a separatist rebel group that has killed nearly 800 people. His first interior minister and other senior officials are on trial for the &quot;dirty war&quot;.</p>
<p>The former prime minister denied a week ago that there had been state terrorism while he was in power -- a statement Aznar's camp appeared to take as a signal that Gonzalez, who had kept a low profile since handing over power, was mounting a major political counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos openly accused Gonzalez of having engineered what he called &quot;bodeguilla terrorism&quot;, in reference to a wine cellar in the prime minister's residence where he entertained friends and hatched strategies with his closest associates.</p>
<p>Alvarez Cascos' statements, coming from a man who controls Spain's intelligence services and has full access to top-secret records, prompted attorneys in one of the &quot;dirty war&quot; trials to call him as a witness. A judge must now rule on the request.</p>
