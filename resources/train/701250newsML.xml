<title>UK: Metals race higher in LME evening, copper tight.</title>
<headline>Metals race higher in LME evening, copper tight.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Base metal prices all moved higher during Wednesday evening LME inter-office trading, tracking a tightening copper market which broke back above $2,400, traders said.</p>
<p>Copper's cash/threes backwardation, which was around $135 at the 1600 gmt kerb close, moved out to $145/155, reflecting U.S. buying and borrowing of September.</p>
<p>Also, the sensitive July/August rate, which was showing $110 backwardation earlier, featured a lack of lenders, traders added.</p>
<p>Three months chased up through $2,400 from kerb closing levels of $2,390 to stand at $2,418/20 a tonne at 1800 gmt.</p>
<p>Now that the uncertainty surrounding July option declaration is over, the ever-present tightness looming around July's &quot;third Wednesday&quot; will keep the market underscored.</p>
<p>Inevitably, zinc was pulled up to another 6-3/4 year high, building on its strong performance in the afternoon rings and ignoring overheated technicals, they said.</p>
<p>Although zinc's contango was slightly wider on Wednesday from the extremely narrow levels of $2/3 seen on Tuesday, tightness in September with major longs facing a big short is encouraging speculative buying.</p>
<p>Zinc was indicated at $1,470/73, up $10 from the kerb, while aluminium rose to $1,618/20.</p>
