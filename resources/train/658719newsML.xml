<p>Poland should create over 1.7 million workplaces by 2005 to keep the unemployment rate from rising, the deputy head of the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;In less than ten years, we have to create over 1.7 million workplaces in order not to increase in the unemployment rate,&quot; Janusz Witkowski told a news conference, adding this will equal the number of people who become elligible to work by 2005.</p>
<p>Poland's unemplyment rate was 12.4 percent in April, down from 13.6 percent at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Another important step will be to do away with society's passive attitude (towards seeking new jobs),&quot; Witkowski said.</p>
<p>He added that in the last two to three years hidden, or unregistered, unemployment grew as more people were disappointed after not immidiately finding new jobs, which caused some to give up seeking employment altogether.</p>
<p>Witkowski said the number of surplus workers in the agriculture sector, who are not neccessary for production and do not receive unemployment benefits, also increased over the last few years.</p>
<p>GUS data showed that after the economic reforms started in 1989, the number of workplaces decreased by 1.9 million, although 724,000 people found employment after 1994.</p>
<p>The director of GUS's labour department Malgorzata Kalaska, also present, said the labour market should now be aimed at expanding the number of employees in the service sector and lower the number of workplaces in agriculture.</p>
<p>The service sector employed 6.8 million people in 1996, or 43 percent of all elligible to work, while 4.4 million people (27 percent) worked in the agriculture.</p>
