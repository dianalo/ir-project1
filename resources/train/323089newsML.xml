<p>Taiwan said on Tuesday it had Guatemala's repeated assurances that their diplomatic ties would not change despite a secret deal under which China reluctantly agreed to back a U.N. peacekeeping mission to Guatemala.</p>
<p>Taiwan officials nevertheless cautioned that they did not know what compromise might have been reached between Guatemala and China, Taiwan's longtime diplomatic arch rival.</p>
<p>&quot;The Guatemalan government assured us before and since the second U.N. Security Council vote that relations and friendship between the two sides would not be affected,&quot; foreign ministry official Yen Bing-Fan was quoted by Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency as saying.</p>
<p>After a week of closed-door talks with Guatemala, China on Monday reversed its U.N. Security Council veto and approved the dispatch of 155 U.N. military observers to Guatemala to monitor peace accords that ended three decades of civil war.</p>
<p>China had vetoed the scheme on January 10 due to Guatemala's ties to Taiwan, seen by Beijing as a rebel province ineligible for sovereign ties since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Yen, the ministry's Latin American affairs chief, said China's pressure had angered Guatemala, one of 30 states in Latin America, Africa and the Pacific recognising the exiled Republic of China on Taiwan, not China's People's Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;Guatemala was outraged by communist China's blackmail and extortion,&quot; Yen said.</p>
<p>Yen said Taipei was checking to see what compromise, if any, Guatemala offered to persuade Beijing to reverse its veto.</p>
<p>U.N. diplomats have said Guatemala appeared to have promised to refrain from sponsoring annual General Assembly resolutions seeking U.N. membership for Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan analysts were divided about whether China's deal with Guatemala could jeopardise Taiwan-Guatemalan ties.</p>
<p>&quot;Communist China realises it made a big mistake,&quot; retired diplomat Bernard Joei told Reuters in a telephone interview. &quot;It reversed the veto because it faced great pressure in the international community.&quot;</p>
<p>A newspaper commentator said it now would be harder for Taiwan to promote its U.N. entry bid in the face of China's willingness to pressure the island's handful of allies.</p>
<p>Guatemala has been among a group of Taiwan allies that for four years running have sought formally to put the question of Taiwan's U.N. membership on the General Assembly's agenda.</p>
<p>China has managed to shoot down the proposals each time.</p>
<p>Beijing, which replaced Taipei in 1971 as China's sole U.N. representative, has tightened a diplomatic embargo around the island by stepping up pressure on the handful of countries that recognise its exiled Republic of China.</p>
