<title>USA: US corporate issuance led by telecoms, trust prfds.</title>
<headline>US corporate issuance led by telecoms, trust prfds.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two high-yielding telecommunication issues, including emerging market startup venture Paging Network do Brasil, are expected to top junk issuance this week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Trust preferred issuers aiming to capture a window of opportunity before the government nixes the tax-deductible nature of the securities will fatten the investment grade calendar meanwhile, high-grade debt syndicates said.</p>
<p>But Tuesday's activity will be predictably slow in the wake of the three-day U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, dealers across both markets said.  </p>
<p>Paging Network do Brasil's deal, totaling $125 million, will include warrants and be structured with a three-year prefunded interest reserve, sources said. The amount of equity has yet to be determined, a fund manager said.</p>
<p>While money managers note &quot;anything will sell for the right price,&quot; they also contended the deal will need to include a big chunk of equity to garner interest.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a prefunded issue but it still feels like a zero coupon to me,&quot; said the manager who declined to be named.  </p>
<p>In addition, wireless issues in general will suffer from the shrinking field of buyers in that sector, dealers said. The poor performance of wireless issues through the first quarter has prevented structured collateralized bond obligation deals from including such debt, dealers said.</p>
<p>Paging Nework do Brasil, and a $300 million InterCel Inc offering slated for next week, were both postponed due to deteriorating market conditions in March.</p>
<p>Lead manager Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc is expected to formally price the Paging Network deal in the 144A private placement market late in the week.  </p>
<p>Also set for this week, competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) ITC Deltacom Inc is expected to price $175 million prefunded senior notes due 2003 via a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co syndicate.</p>
<p>Analysts said the CLEC sector, riding on the coattails of positive first quarter earnings and prospects of industry consolidation, will give those credits a step up.</p>
<p>On Friday, CLEC Brooks Fiber Properties Inc upsized a $200 million 10 percent, 10-year debt offering to $250 million due to strong demand, players said. The issue came on the wide side of early talk but consequently traded up more than one point when freed to trade, traders said.  </p>
<p>Turning to investment grades, a $600 million three-part debt offering from Hartford Life will lead issuance in terms of size this week, but syndicates talked of a rapidly building calendar of trust preferred, or capital security, issues.</p>
<p>Centura Banks Inc is planning to raise $100 million in an offering of capital securities as early as this week via BT Securities Corp, according to an investment grade syndicate source.</p>
<p>The deal will be structured to include 30-year debt, non-callable for 10 years, the source said.</p>
<p>Also due this week is a $300 million capital security issue from Washington Mutual Capital I, sources said.</p>
<p>Other straight corporate debt issues due are $200 million 10-year debt from Tandy Corp via Bear Stearns &amp; Co and $175 million in five- and 10-year debt from Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp through Credit Suisse First Boston, sources said.</p>
