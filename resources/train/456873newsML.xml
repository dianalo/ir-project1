<p>Gold drifted lower on Thursday afternoon as the market came to grips with comments by the U.S. central bank head suggesting interest rates may soon rise.</p>
<p>But prices remained above the psychological $350 an ounce range, and dealers said the market was not ready to rule out the upside in coming days.</p>
<p>Highly visible speculative buying out of New York's Comex market has buffeted the market this week and helped lift gold prices on Wednesday from a London close of $348.70/$349.20.</p>
<p>A repeat of such volatility was still seen as a possibility in coming days, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not over yet. Today Europe came in strong and New York put it under pressure rather than the other way around. But no one expected the fund buying yesterday,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold had registered little immediate reaction to comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan which signalled the Fed may raise interest rates at next week's policy-making session for the first time in two years.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $352.00 an ounce shortly after his comments, compared to $352.70 in the morning.</p>
<p>But prices subsequently dipped towards $350.50 an ounce while the dollar surged and the stock market dropped, before stabilising.</p>
<p>A rise in interest rates is traditionally considered bearish for the gold market, in part because it would increase the cost of holding on to the metal.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe that the kind of rate rise that has been discussed would be that damaging for gold,&quot; said analyst Tony Warwick-Ching of CRU International.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, if it caused the dollar to gain much against the yen that would be more worrying. The weaker yen has been bad for gold in Japan,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Silver was little changed at $5.19/$5.21, down just one cent from Wednesday's London close. It was watching gold.</p>
<p>The other white metals were off highs as players took profits following good gains in platinum and palladium on Wednesday and early Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Platinum was off its highs at $379.00/$380.00, but it was still up $2.75 from Wednesday's London close.</p>
<p>Palladium similarly was below the days' highs at $150.25/$151.25. But it was still up $3.75 from Thursday on buiying believed to be on behalf of a fund.</p>
