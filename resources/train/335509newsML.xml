<headline>GM hikes dividend, sets $2.5 billion stock buyback.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-01-27</dateline>

<p>General Motors Corp. said Monday its board of directors increased the company's quarterly common stock dividend by 10 cents a share and approved a $2.5 billion stock buyback programme.</p>
<p>GM said the stock repurchases would take place over the next 12 months and at current prices would represent slightly more than 5 percent of the common shares in its core automotive business.  </p>
<p>GM shares, which rose sharply last week in anticipation, were off $1.875 at $60.625 following the announcement. Some analysts had predicted a stock buyback plan of up to $5 billion and a dividend increase of as much as 20 cents a share.</p>
<p>The dividend increase on GM's automotive stock raised the quarterly per-share payout to 50 cents from 40 cents previously.</p>
<p>GM also raised the dividend on its Class H shares, which are tied to the performance of its Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, to 25 cents a share from 24 cents. The new dividends on both stocks are payable March 10 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 6.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to pursue the repurchase programme vigorously,&quot; GM Chairman Jack Smith said in a statement. &quot;The decision to announce a $2.5 billion programme at this time is based on our belief that we can execute a programme of this size quickly and with confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith said GM will consider additional stock repurchases in the future. The automaker ended 1996 with a cash balance of $17 billion, compared with $10.2 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
