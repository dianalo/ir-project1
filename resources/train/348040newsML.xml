<p>The economy rebounded strongly in the closing quarter last year, the Commerce Department said on Friday, shaking off its summer doldrums with a surge in consumer spending and booming foreign sales.</p>
<p>The nation's gross domestic product expanded at a surprisingly robust 4.7 percent annual rate in the three months from October through December, more than double the 2.1 percent pace posted during the third quarter, the department said in its first look at fourth-quarter performance.</p>
<p>The jump in fourth-quarter GDP was significantly stronger than the 3.9 percent annual rate of increase forecast by Wall Street economists. It matched the second-quarter's performance and has not been surpassed since the second quarter of 1994, when GDP jumped at a 4.9 percent annual rate.</p>
<p>But two broad inflation measures in the GDP report suggested the rate of price rises remained generally in check. The implicit price deflator advanced at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, down from 1.7 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>A separate fixed-weights measure of price changes slowed to a 1.8 percent rate of increase from 2 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;You have a battle going on between the actual growth figure and the inflationary readings,&quot; said Kevin Flanagan, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;Nevertheless, fourth-quarter growth was far more than anybody was looking for, and it is something that's going to keep the (Federal Reserve) on notice that growth is eclipsing their expectations by a visible amount.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fed's Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday and Wednesday to consider its interest rate policy.</p>
<p>Cold weather and a buoyant stock market played a role in the fourth-quarter jump in activity, the department said, firing up demand for electrical utilities and fattening incomes at brokerages in busy trading.</p>
<p>GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital within U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Consumers spent freely as the year ended, in sharp contrast to the third quarter, when they reined in spending. In addition, exports were strong after contracting in the third quarter, adding a boost to the economy in the closing quarter of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The acceleration was more than accounted for by a sharp turnaround in net exports and an acceleration in consumer spending,&quot; the department said.</p>
<p>Consumer spending grew at a $38.8 billion annual rate in the fourth quarter, compared with a $5.9-billion rate in the third quarter. Consumer purchases of goods and services account for two-thirds of national economic activity, so the resumption of strong spending was a key influence on the pickup in activity.</p>
<p>Exports rose at a $47.7-billion annual rate in the fourth quarter after falling at a $1.8 billion rate in the third quarter. At the same time, growth in imports slowed to $11 billion a year from $20.9 billion in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The department pointed out that domestic energy prices picked up in the final quarter after falling in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The vigorous spending slowed the growth of inventories of unsold goods late last year, possibly setting the stage for steady production this year to catch up on stocks of many types of products.</p>
<p>Businesses increased their inventories at a $31.9 billion rate in the fourth quarter, down from a $34.5 billion pace in the third quarter. The slower rate of increase acted as a restraint on GDP growth.</p>
<p>In addition, companies pared back the rate at which they spent to expand their plants and to add new equipment. New investment increased at an annual rate of $8 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $30.9 billion in the third quarter last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The acceleration in real GDP was moderated by a downturn in inventory investment and by a slowdown in business equipment,&quot; the department noted.</p>
<p>For the full year, the economy grew 2.5 percent, a pickup from the 2 percent reate in 1995. But that was well below the 3.5 percent jump in national output in 1994 -- the peak year in the current expansion that has lasted since the last recession in 1991.</p>
