<p>Britain's new Conservative leader William Hague on Friday began the task of rebuilding his party after its crushing May 1 election defeat and forging it into an effective opposition to the Labour government.</p>
<p>A day after the 36-year-old's triumph over former finance minister Kenneth Clarke in a third and final leadership ballot, Hague was selecting his team to &quot;shadow&quot; the Labour cabinet.</p>
<p>Hague said the party had to bear no grudges and look forward after a bitter leadership battle. He was expected to name some of his former rivals in the leadership race to his cabinet to show he was serious about wanting to heal the party's wounds.</p>
<p>But one and possibly two key names will be missing, spelling possible trouble in the future for the Conservative party's youngest leader in 200 years.</p>
<p>Former finance minister Clarke offered Hague his &quot;unstinting and loyal&quot; support and turned up at the young leader's celebration party. But he announced on Thursday he was stepping down from the political front line after 26 years.</p>
<p>John Redwood declined to make any comment after Hague's victory. The staunch anti-European quit the cabinet two years ago to fight John Major for the party leadership and backed Clarke in the latest contest after his own hopes ended.</p>
<p>Few commentators saw room for Redwood, whose backing of Clarke was seen as a coldly-calculated marriage of opposites driven only by their desire to stop Hague, in the new team. But he remains one of the brightest minds on the party's right wing.</p>
<p>Former interior minister Michael Howard, who backed Hague after his own hopes were dashed in the first round, said he expected the new leader to unite all wings of his party.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be room in the shadow cabinet for all strands of opinion. We must work together,&quot; said Howard, who many have tipped for the post of opposition foreign affairs spokesman.</p>
<p>Conservative chairman Brian Mawhinney said the party, reduced to 164 MPs by Labour's victory, less than half the number they won at the 1992 election, was ready to unite. &quot;The party is hungry to come together behind the new leader.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspaper reaction was also generally favourable.</p>
<p>&quot;The Conservative party took a first step on the road back to realism last night,&quot; the Times said in a leader article. The pro-Conservative Daily Telegraph called it &quot;the right result&quot;.</p>
<p>But the leftwing Guardian's front page headline, picking up on concerns about Hague's ability to heal the splits between pro and anti-Europeans, asked: &quot;Mission Impossible?&quot;</p>
<p>Hague also had a warning from former prime minister John Major to MPs ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Major, who received a standing ovation from MPs before they confirmed Hague as their leader, told them there could be no room for the division which dogged his last days and which contributed to his party's crushing election defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are going to get back in government not only are you going to be asked to support William when you think he's right, there will be occasions when you don't and that's when you should support him in public,&quot; said Major.</p>
<p>The former prime minister has made clear he will not be serving in the shadow cabinet.</p>
