<text>
<p>About 50 youths set cars on fire and attacked police with pickaxes and baseball bats in the northern English city of Leeds in the early hours of Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>Riot police were called in when the gang took to the streets of Leeds overnight.</p>
<p>Police said the riots appeared to be well planned and pre-meditated. Detectives believe the disturbances may be linked to drug arrests they made in the area earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Police said 20 cars were set ablaze by the youths who were dispersed by riot police after about an hour. There were no casualties.</p>
