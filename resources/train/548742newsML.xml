<p>South Korean state prosecutors plan to seek the arrest of President Kim Young-sam's second son next month on charges not connected to a loans-for-kickbacks scandal, prosecution officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A prosecution spokesman told reporters an investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing linking Kim Hyun-chul to the collapse in January of Hanbo Steel Co under $5.8 billion in debts.</p>
<p>The spokesman gave no other details but a senior prosecutor told Reuters the prosecution had secured evidence implicating Kim Hyun-chul in other offences, for which an arrest warrant would be sought.</p>
<p>The influential Dong-A Ilbo daily quoted prosecutor-general Kim Ki-soo as saying in an interview: &quot;We can't help but arrest Hyun-chul over personal irregularities unrelated to the Hanbo case because otherwise there might be accusations that we have tried to curtail the investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman said he was confident the prosecution could end its probe into Kim Hyun-chul by May 10.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have been probing rumours that Kim Hyun-chul pocketed 200 billion won ($224 million) through a businessman, Park Tae-joong, acting as an agent for Hanbo.</p>
<p>Park was summoned for questioning on Monday and on Tuesday had still not emerged from the state prosecutors' office.</p>
<p>The spokesman denied Dong-A Ilbo's report that the chief prosecutor indicated he would step down after Kim Hyun-chul was arrested.</p>
<p>But he confirmed that the chief prosecutor was unhappy that prosecutors had been pressured by public opinion to take legal action against the younger Kim.</p>
<p>The collapse of South Korea's second largest steelmaker uncovered a web of corruption among politicians, bankers and businessmen.</p>
<p>Eleven people, including ruling and opposition party lawmakers, top aides to President Kim, bankers and Hanbo founder Chung Tae-soo are on trial for bribery. But the opposition has accused Kim Hyun-chul of being the key player.</p>
<p>In tearful testimony to parliament on Friday, Kim Hyun-chul begged for forgiveness for hurting his father but denied taking bribes to keep loans rolling in to Hanbo. Opinion polls indicate most Koreans do not believe him and want legal action.</p>
<p>During the testimony, the junior Kim also countered charges by opposition politicians that he meddled in state affairs, including key appointments, and schemed with the help of the intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Police said meanwhile they had determined that a former banker embroiled in the scandal and found hanging in his home on Monday committed suicide.</p>
<p>Park Suk-tae was an executive director of Korea First Bank, the main creditor of Hanbo Steel.</p>
<p>A police officer said the banker left a suicide note apologising to his former colleagues and his family and asking that his body be cremated.</p>
<p>He was not charged with any crime but complained he felt humiliated by being called to testify before parliament on April 17 into the Hanbo failure, the officer said.</p>
<p>Park quit the bank in March after he was warned by the Office of Bank Supervision that the bank's loans to Hanbo were not backed by sufficient collateral, a bank spokesman said.</p>
