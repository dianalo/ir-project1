<p>Earthquakes that rocked Iran in the past four months put a huge strain on its emergency supplies and sparked an urgent need for international help, a United Nations official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Andres Frismark, deputy resident representative in Tehran of the United Nations Development Programme, said Iran's government and Red Crescent Society reacted swiftly to the latest quake which struck on Saturday leaving 200 villages in eastern Iran in ruin and killing nearly 2,400 people.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of human resources, they are doing extremely well, a marvellous job. But what has become critical now is the stocks,&quot; he said by telephone from Tehran.</p>
<p>&quot;The Red Crescent, which has warehouses in most disaster-prone areas, has stockpiles which are reaching a weak level and need to be replenished. That has become critical.</p>
<p>&quot;Help and assistance is not just needed for that purpose but also for now. Immediate help is needed urgently,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Frismark said the U.N. was not aware of any international aid arriving in Iran so far for the 10,000 families, or some 50,000 people, displaced by the force 7.1 earthquake.</p>
<p>&quot;...Not all of them lost their homes, some are living outdoors and will only return to their homes once the aftershocks end and this will not happen for at least one week,&quot; Frismark said.</p>
<p>Iran's Arab neighbours Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates said they were sending aid. So did Egypt. The United States and France said they were ready to help.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and the UAE said they were sending two planeloads each of food, medicine, blankets and tents.</p>
<p>The Saudi-based Organisation of the Islamic Conference, appealed to its 52 member states to extend assistance to Iran.</p>
<p>Quake-prone Iran, accustomed to dealing with natural disasters, on Sunday appealed through the United Nations for international aid and Frismark said a detailed list of Iran's needs was being prepared.</p>
<p>Iran asked for food, medicine, tents, clothing, water tanks, cookers, ambulances and four-wheel drive vehicles to use in relief works in the mountainous area near the Afghan border.</p>
<p>The appeal, issued by the U.N. office in Tehran, said there was no need for international help in the rescue operations, which Iranian officials said were almost completed.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to increase the effectiveness and speed of international assistance, the government would prefer local purchases of the required items,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The appeal said relief supplies in Iran were &quot;fully stretched&quot; and that there appeared to be &quot;considerable damage to the irrigation system which will inevitably affect the local agriculture of fruits, saffron, barberry, wheat and other cash crops&quot;.</p>
<p>Iran has put initial estimates of the extent of damages in the region at 230 billion rials ($77 million). It said 4,300 relief workers set up 9,000 tents and were handing out food.</p>
<p>Another earthquake, registering 4.8 on the Richter scale, hit the cities of Ardabil and Nir in northwestern Iran on Monday, but there was no report yet on possible loss of life or damage to property, the official news agency IRNA reported.</p>
<p>More than six tremors with magnitude of more than four have hit Iran since February 28 when an earthquake with an intensity of 5.5 jolted the region, killing about 1,000 people and injuring at least 2,600.</p>
<p>Iran had appealed for international help after the February quake. The other milder quakes had left limited damage.</p>
