<p>British Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell denied contradicting government policy on a single European currency on Sunday after ruling out London joining in the first wave on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>In a statement issued through the Conservative Party Central Office, Dorrell said his remarks during a television interview were not meant to be at odds with government policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I entirely agree with the government position and no words I used on The Dimbleby Programme were intended to question it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not ruled out joining the single currency on January 1, 1999. We have said we believe the likelihood of our doing so is extremely small.&quot;</p>
<p>It was an embarrassing about-face for the minister, once seen as a contender for the party leadership should Prime Minister John Major step down after the forthcoming election.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party, tipped to win the election which must be held by May 22, said Dorrell's remarks proved the government was in a state of confusion and chaos over Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't understand what this government means from day to day and hour to hour,&quot; said Labour's deputy leader John Prescott.</p>
<p>Major, battling to keep his party united in the runup to the election, has said it is &quot;very unlikely, though not impossible&quot; that Britain may join in the first wave in 1999.</p>
<p>The government has in the past adopted a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; attitude to the currency and ministers said they did not expect the project to be launched on time.</p>
<p>But Dorrell went one step further during the early morning interview on GMTV, ruling out British entry in two years time.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's position, I would have thought, on the single currency is now as clear as you could ask for it to be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And that is: first of all, no single currency without a referendum and, secondly, we shan't be joining a single currency on January 1, 1999, but we think that Britain ought to continue to participate in the discussion and take a decision subject to a referendum on Britain's interests alone.&quot;</p>
<p>It was second time in as many weeks that Dorrell seemed to be at odds with government policy.</p>
<p>He caused a row last month by apparently promising a future Conservative administration would abolish any Scottish parliament set up by a Labour government.</p>
<p>Labour claimed the remark was at odds with the views of the ruling party's Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who said the Conservatives would not reverse any devolution in Scotland by a Labour government.</p>
<p>Major, when quizzed on the confusion over the Scottish question, backed Forsyth and declined to say whether Dorrell would retain the campaigning role on constitutional issues that he had been given last summer by party chairman Britain Mawhinney.</p>
