<p>Danish telecommuncations company Tele Danmark said Wednesday it acquired Germany's Talkline mobile telephone company from RWE Telliance for about 2.2 billion Danish crowns ($331 million).</p>
<p>On June 13, Tele Danmark announced it was seeking to buy the mobile telephone company and was close to reaching a deal with RWE Telliance.</p>
<p>Talkline, which operates in Germany, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, was a subsidiary of German industrial company RWE, which is already a partner along with Tele Danmark in the MiniRuf paging system company.</p>
<p>&quot;The takeover of Talkline means an expansion of Tele Danmark's telephony activities in Germany and Tele Danmark's efforts to integrate fixed and mobile telephone services there,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Talkline is the second-biggest service company in Germany's telecommunications industry, with some 385,000 customers, a 7 percent share of the GSM mobile telephone market and sharply rising revenues.</p>
