<p>Singapore June gas oil swaps firmed at midday Friday after Thursday's cash purchases by a Japanese trader supported the prompt market and widened the June/July differential, traders and brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the spread between June and July prices has widened to around 30 cents from 15 cents seen on Thursday.</p>
<p>June gas oil swaps were last quoted at $25.30/$25.45, up from at least 20 cents from Thursday quotes at $25.00/$25.10.</p>
<p>July was last seen at $24.95/$25.10 up marginally from Thursday's $24.85/$24.95.</p>
<p>Traders said the widened spread between the two months were triggered by Marubeni International Petroleum Co purchase of 600,000 barrels of gas oil on Thursday.</p>
<p>The company bought a total of four gas oil cargoes at between $25.10 and $25.35 per barrel for end-May to mid-June lifting on a free-on-board basis.</p>
<p>The purchases brought some relief to sellers who were previously concerned that prices may fall below the $25.00 per barrel support in the cash market.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be happy if Thursday's buying would be repeated today,&quot; said one potential seller.</p>
<p>But some traders remained cautious, citing the low awards seen in the recent Taiwan and Sri Lanka tenders and high stocks in Singapore.</p>
<p>Fuel oil was last quoted at $101.00/$102.00, unchanged from Thursday quotes. But a firm undertone, supported by fresh demand and fewer exports from the Middle East, may pull prices up further, traders said.</p>
<p>The crude market provided very little direction to guide swaps quotes, traders said.</p>
<p>The prompt June contract on ACCESS were last quoted at $21.27, down a marginal three cents from its last official close.</p>
<p>Overnight crude values for the June contract on IPE were downed a marginal seven cents at $19.44 per barrel as the contract expired Thursday.</p>
