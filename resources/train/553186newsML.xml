<headline>Eurobonds inactive ahead of U.S. data, holidays.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The primary market came to a standstill on Thursday, with many market players on holiday and others remaining on the sidelines ahead of the release of U.S. jobs data on Friday.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury bonds have made gains this week, but the April U.S. employment report will be closely watched for signs of inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Employment is forecast to rise by 211,000, compared with a 175,000 rise in March, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>Most of Europe and Latin America was off work on Thursday due to May Day or Labour Day holidays.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Britain, which has a public holiday on Monday, people took to the polls in an election that may topple the Conservative government after 18 years in power.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of political experts predicted a 92-seat majority in parliament for the main opposition Labour party.</p>
<p>Although many houses will have Eurosterling traders on the floor all night, and all will be staffed by 0500 GMT, dealers said there was unlikely to be much activity in the Eurosterling sector until late morning on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will do their government (gilt) business first, and then concentrate on Eurobonds,&quot; a dealer at a UK bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be a clear indication of what the Eurobond market's reaction is to the election results until late morning or early afternoon (Friday),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The sector's 10-year benchmark bond, an EIB 7.625 percent 2007 issue, was trading at around 10 b.p. over gilts. The five-year benchmark, a Fannie Mae 6.875 percent 2002 bond, was quoted at around 11.5 b.p. over.</p>
<p>Also in sterling, it was reported that CSFB and J.P. Morgan were preparing to underwrite the first sterling-denominated junk bond to fund the acquisition of the BBC's transmission network.</p>
<p>Bankers familiar with Castle Transmission Services, a U.S.-led consortium which bought the BBC's domestic radio and television network for around 250 million stg last February, said it was looking at funding options but had not yet decided on what type of transaction to use.</p>
<p>There was speculation Castle Transmission might launch a 100 million stg junk bond after investor presentations next week.</p>
