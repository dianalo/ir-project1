<p>New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch, in Hong Kong on the latest leg of an international tour, said he was not unduly worried by his country's current account deficit, though he said it was a subject of debate.</p>
<p>In an interview monitored in Wellington, Birch told Reuters Financial Television the government was confident it could control the current account deficit even though it continued to be over four percent of GDP and was set to rise through 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look behind those numbers... that's manageable, and there is no undue concern about the current account deficit,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Birch, who has been meeting credit rating agencies in London and New York, acknowleged that there has been some debate about the size of the deficit.</p>
<p>But he stressed that he believed that forecasts of more rapid economic growth and repayment of overseas and domestic debt meant the underlying situation was more benign.</p>
