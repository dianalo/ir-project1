<headline>Eurobourses end mixed, Frankfurt at record.</headline>

<p>European bourses, rattled by a weak performance on Wall Street, closed mixed on Wednesday despite setting a record-breaking pace earlier this week.</p>
<p>The dollar ended European trading slightly higher after a day of quiet dealings. The currency was earlier buoyed by news of Japanese capital outflows into foreign investments which could give it support.</p>
<p>In the equity markets, German stocks were the stars. Stocks ended at a record 2,702.99 points on the DAX index, largely on the strength of a buoyant telecoms sector.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's performance, shrugging off a poor overnight showing by Wall Street, marginally eclipsed its earlier closing peak set only two days ago of 2702.64.</p>
<p>But transactions on the after-hours, computerised IBIS index slipped and dealers said German shares will struggle to break away from current levels.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no fundamental reason to sell so people are not really ready to do that. On the other hand we have no clear motives to buy either,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Telecoms sector generated excitement after utility group RWE AG revealed a surprise shift in allegiances, boosting its stocks and those of its prospective German partner Veba AG.</p>
<p>Other European bourses ended well down, depressed by Wall Street, which fell by 0.5 percent in morning trade on profit-taking and worries about the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>The lacklustre showing on both sides of the Atlantic came on the heels of a bull-run fuelled by signs that U.S. economic growth was slowing, with the prospect of subdued inflation and low interest rates.</p>
<p>London, Europe's biggest bourse, ended the day down 0.7 percent after closing at a high of 4,035.6 points on the FTSE index on Tuesday, its fourth consecutive closing record largely propelled by Wall Street's surge.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had some heavyweights suffering badly today -- drugs, Glaxo, ICI and British Telecom -- and that brought the index down,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a terrific run and if you take out the big losers today, the market has been fine.&quot;</p>
<p>In Paris, stocks also closed down 0.7 percent after slipping in and out of positive territory throughout the day.</p>
<p>The dollar ended the European cycle barely changed from Tuesday's level's after strengthening slightly against the yen and the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;With no news to go on, the market is just ranging,&quot; said a Japanese bank dealer. &quot;Dollar/mark is well-supported at 1.5240 and dollar/yen at 111 but it's also lacking any follow-through to build on its recent gains.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the current ranges are likely to remain in place until Friday's U.S. retail sales and producer price data for September, but only figures well outside expectations are expected to shift the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The next event is the U.S. data. I see the market remaining quite dull until then. The trend is in place,&quot; said Paul Lambert, senior economist at UBS in London.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5285 marks and 111.48 yen compared with 1.5268 marks and 111.22 yen late in Europe on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 26.3 points lower at 4,009.3.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished down 14.83 at 2,146.71.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 11.82 at 2,702.99. The IBIS DAX ended at 2,685.23.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold ended at $381.45 in Europe, compared with Tuesday's close of $381.00. Silver closed at $4.94, up four cents.</p>
