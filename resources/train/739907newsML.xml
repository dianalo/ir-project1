<p>U.S. Treasuries held Tokyo's lower levels in London on Friday, with the market starting to show its nerves ahead of Congressional testimony from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan next week.</p>
<p>&quot;We've actually seen some buying in the 10-year note but we got hit on some bonds earlier in the session from a Japanese seller,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. bank in London. &quot;But we haven't seen the trade substantiated.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said the cash market may be taking its cue from the futures market, which slid through initial support in automated trade.</p>
<p>The benchmark long bond was quoted at 101-15, sitting on the key 6.5 percent yield at 0955 GMT, compared with 101-17 in Tokyo and 101-24 at New York's close.</p>
<p>According to GovPX, volume was roughly $3.48 billion.</p>
<p>September T-bond futures were quoted at 114-10, down 11/32 and below support at Thursday's CBOT pit settlement of 114-17.</p>
<p>Data out this session include May international trade, which was expected to show a widening of the trade gap to $9.18 billion from $8.36 billion in April and the preliminary survey from the University of Michigan for July, seen largely steady on June's 104.5 reading.</p>
<p>But analysts said the data would likely be overshadowed by Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy and economic conditions before a House Banking subcommittee on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has had a good run...but it still has a positive tone to it,&quot; said Dick Howard, senior economist at Bank Julius Baer in London. &quot;It's now going to worry about Greenspan.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the market would be keen to see whether Greenspan would say anthing about whether productivity growth can continue to curb inflation as the U.S. economy continues to chug along.</p>
<p>Antennae would also be tuned to anything he says about equity prices after the Dow Jones Industrial Average streaked past the 8,000 barrier on Wednesday.</p>
