<title>USA: Designer Holdings in DKNY Jeanswear licensing deal.</title>
<headline>Designer Holdings in DKNY Jeanswear licensing deal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Designer Holdings Ltd. said Monday it signed a 30-year licensing agreement with Donna Karan International to manufacture and distribute DKNY Jeanswear worldwide.</p>
<p>Designer Holdings, which also develops and markets Calvin Klein Jeans, will receive an initial payment of $6 million plus an additional $54 million to be paid over a four-year period.</p>
<p>The New York-based company will pay Donna Karan a 7 percent royalty on total sales, subject to guaranteed minimum payments. International sales are also subject to an administrative fee of 2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This agreement represents a key component of our long term strategy to generate incremental growth through the acquisition of additional licenses and brand names,&quot; said Arnold Simon, chief executive officer of Designer Holdings.</p>
<p>Designer Holdings develops, sources and markets designer sportswear collections under the Calvin Klein Jeans, CK/Calvin Klein Jeans and CK/Calvin Klein Jeans Khakis labels.</p>
<p>The new license is expected to generate incremental sales of about $85 million to $95 million in the second half of 1997, Designer Holdings said.</p>
<p>Designer Holdings will take over the production, inventory and design of DKNY Jeanswear on June 1, 1997 and start shipping the newly designed product lines in time for the fall 1997 selling season. To launch the new line, it will fund an extensive advertising campaign beginning in March, which will continue throughout 1997.</p>
<p>Exclusive of these advertising costs, purchase accounting adjustments and start-up costs, the company expects the deal to have no impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first half of 1997. The deal will boost earnings beginning in the second half of 1997, it said.</p>
<p>Separately, Designer Holdings said it plans to file an offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $100 million through the sale of convertible preferred securities.</p>
<p>Proceeds will be used to finance the growth of both the Calvin Klein Jeans and DKNY Jeanswear businesses.</p>
<p>Designer Holdings' stock fell $2.125 to $24.625, and Donna Karan rose 25 cents to $24.25 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-morning.</p>
