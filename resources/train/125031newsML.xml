<p>Leading stories in the Greek general press:</p>
<p>KATHIMERINI</p>
<p>--Alarm bells go off as one of the largest foreign investments in Greece appears to hang in the balance. Canadian firm TVX Gold tells government that it will pull out of its 65 billion drachma northern Greek gold mining investment if no action is taken to end the 10-month-long disruption of work by local residents. Development Minister Vasso Papandreou says she has told local police to immediately end the blockade.</p>
<p>--Government decides to refer the matter of the recalled licence for a casino at Floisvos, Athens to a parliamentary investigative committee. Committee to examine possible irregularities in procedures by former tourism minister Dionysis Livanos.</p>
<p>--There's 'serious displeasure' in the ranks of the ruling party PASOK over the government's course and programme and evidence from yesterday's party deputies meeting of an internal opposition. Move to set up investigation into Floisvos casino appears to be an indication that those receiving 'coverage' from the previous Papandreou government will not get the same deal under Prime Minister Costas Simitis.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROTYPIA</p>
<p>--Former tourism minister Dionysis Livanos 'in the dock' for his role in granting the Athens Casino Consortium &quot;a non-legal operating licence in contravention of the Constitution&quot;.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, conservative New Democracy and Left Coalition, call for preliminary investigation which could lead to a special court and charges.</p>
<p>--The 42 blank votes in yesterday's PASOK deputies poll for Parliament spokesman are an indication of the dissatisfaction reigning amongst ruling party MPs.</p>
<p>TA NEA</p>
<p>--European Union orders austerity, threatens punishment as it acts as Greece's finance ministry. Following yesterday's Commission decisions, the finance ministry in essence has moved to Brussels until Greece enters economic and monetary union. The EU leaves little room for the Greek government to shape an economic policy.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROS TYPOS</p>
<p>--Petrol turns into ... champagne as heating fuel prices rise 20 percent over last year. Family budgets go down the drain.</p>
<p>ETHNOS</p>
<p>--Tax officials go hunting for extra revenues at bars, nightclubs and big business.</p>
