<title>FRANCE: French stocks end lower in consolidation.</title>
<headline>French stocks end lower in consolidation.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-01-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Profit-taking in the afternoon brought Fench shares to a softer close. Traders said a consolidation was natural after yesterday's rapid rise to giddy historic highs.</p>
<p>Traders cited various factors supporting the orderly retreat, including health worries for Russian president Boris Yeltsin and weakness on Wall Street and in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 14.16 points or 0.59 percent at 2,387.98. The CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,391 from 2,406 on Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was a hefty nine billion francs.  </p>
<p>* Axa retreats 2.17 percent to 341.9 francs, as market sources cite fears of an issue of new shares from early conversion of a convertible bond issued in 1993.</p>
<p>* Any new shares should not dilute earnings as the potential 14 million new shares should already be factored into analysts' earnings forecasts.</p>
<p>* Accor bucks the market, rising 0.62 percent to 651 francs, after Paribas Capital Markets upgrades the stock to neutral from sell, citing favourable currency moves.</p>
<p>* Lagardere gains 2.62 percent to 148.8. Analysts consider it undervalued, ripe investors looking for medium caps.  </p>
<p>* Lagardere has lagged the sector and could benefit from a break up of its defence and communications activities, or the disposal of military interest. Such deals could be independent of whether it wins Thomson-CSF in the current privatisation effort.</p>
<p>* Canal Plus ended unchanged at 1,106 francs, after the broadcaster confirmed it signed an agreement on tuesday to take 52 percent in a Swiss company to manage the Servette Geneva soccer club.</p>
<p>* Synthelabo, Sanofi and Credit National fall to profit taking.  </p>
<p>* Valeo ends up 3.03 percent at 370.9, helped by rumours of possible entry into the CAC index, replacing UAP, also talk of big General Motors contract.</p>
<p>* Havas falls after steep rises on speculation it might make a buy-out offer to minority shareholders in CEP Communications.</p>
<p>* SGS-Thomson adds 4.73 percent to 411.6, on the back of strong fourth-quarter profit growth for Intel.</p>
