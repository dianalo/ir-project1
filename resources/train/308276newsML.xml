<p>A former Rwandan mayor on trial for genocide on Wednesday cross-examined a farmer who claims he was tortured by the accused.</p>
<p>Under the rules of the U.N. Rwanda genocide tribunal accused Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of Rwanda's central Taba commune, can cross-examine prosecution witnesses, including the Hutu farmer known as &quot;C&quot; to protect his identity.</p>
<p>Witness C stripped off his shirt on Tuesday to show the court scars he said he received when he was tortured and beaten by Akayesu and Hutu militiamen one night during the 1994 genocide.</p>
<p>Akayesu is accused of genocide and crimes against humanity during the mass killings of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
<p>The genocide was sparked off by the assassination of Hutu president and military strongman Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6, 1994. Angry Hutu followers took up arms and hunted down Tutsis and Hutus opposed to his junta.</p>
<p>The farmer said Akayesu took him into a forest with Interahamwe militiamen. He was made to lie on his back and then beaten him with gun butts with Akayesu stamping on his face before tying him by the neck so that he vomited.</p>
<p>Wednesday's cross-examination brought accused and victim face-to-face forcing the witness to relive his ordeal in detail.</p>
<p>&quot;I was bleeding because Akayesu stepped on my face with his shoe. I tried to get up and I had a bloody nose and wounds on my back,&quot; the witness said asked by Akayesu to describe his ordeal.</p>
<p>During questions Akayesu who has pleaded not guilty tried to firm up the details of the witness's testimony but did not dispute the essence his story.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did Akayesu not kill you,&quot; Akayesu asked.</p>
<p>&quot;He knows himself because he fetched me and then afterwards he told me to go home,&quot; the witness replied.</p>
<p>During 90 minutes of questions there were frequent interventions from Presiding Judge Laity Kama demanding clarifications and explaining court rules.</p>
<p>Akayesu, wearing a dark suit with a sheaf of papers on his knee, asked questions from behind a screen flanked by two security guards.</p>
<p>He is the first suspect to be tried before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda set up to bring to justice the architects of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which was only ended by victorious Tutsi rebels now in power.</p>
<p>Akayesu has pleaded not guilty to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. If convicted he will face life imprisonment, the tribunal's highest penalty.</p>
<p>Last week, another witness known only as &quot;K&quot;, a Rwandan Tutsi accountant in Akayesu's office said she witnessed Akayesu order eight Tutsis hacked to death on April 19, 1994.</p>
<p>The trial was briefly adjourned and will resume with questions from defence counsel whom Akayesu is trying to fire.</p>
<p>In all 21 people have been indicted by the tribunal of whom seven are in custody at tribunal headquarters in Arusha.</p>
<p>Separate trials have also started in the Rwandan capital Kigali and in other towns of the tiny tea and coffee-growing central African nation.</p>
<p>Rwanda holds about 90,000 people suspected of taking part in the genocide but has only just started putting them on trial. Two Hutu men were sentenced to death in Kibungo on January 3.</p>
