<title>SPAIN: Spain's Supreme Court to demand &quot;dirty war&quot; files.</title>
<headline>Spain's Supreme Court to demand &quot;dirty war&quot; files.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spain's Supreme Court said on Friday it would ask the government to hand over secret files purporting to prove the former Socialist administration set up death squads which waged a &quot;dirty war&quot; against Basque separatists.</p>
<p>The court said it wanted to examine the secret service files before making a decision on whether it would demand that they be declassified.</p>
<p>Lower courts are calling for the declassification of some 20 documents that give details of a secret campaign of assassinations and kidnappings against guerrillas of ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The ruling conservative Popular Party (PP) and the previous Socialist administration have refused, citing reasons of state security.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Margarita Mariscal de Gante said on Friday the government would respect the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>&quot;For a long time the cabinet has said that it would obey their decision,&quot; she told reporters.</p>
<p>Documents already leaked to the press suggest the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez was responsible for organising death squads known as the Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups (GAL), which killed 28 people between 1983 and 1987.</p>
<p>If the government hands over the papers, it will be the first time the judges have had access to information classified as state secrets, local media said.</p>
<p>The court, comprising 33 judges, is due to announce its decision on whether it will insist the government declassify the papers in the next few weeks.</p>
