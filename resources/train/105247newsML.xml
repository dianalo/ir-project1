<title>CAMBODIA: Thailand says Khmer Rouge fugitives in Cambodia.</title>
<headline>Thailand says Khmer Rouge fugitives in Cambodia.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1996-10-09</dateline>

<p>Thailand on Wednesday denied reports that Khmer Rouge fugitives were in its territory and asserted they were in southern Cambodia.</p>
<p>&quot;They are in Cambodian territory...in the southern part, opposite (southeast Thailand's) Trat province,&quot; Thai Ambassador Domedej Bunnag told reporters after meeting First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh at Phnom Penh airport.</p>
<p>Domedej reiterated Thailand's policy of pushing the guerrillas back across the border if they strayed into Thailand, saying this was because the neighbours had no extradition policy and Bangkok did not want to meddle in Cambodia's internal affairs.</p>
<p>He said the Thais had pushed back Ta Mok, a top Pol Pot aide and commander, on October 4 but gave no details.</p>
<p>The ambassador, who spoke after Ranariddh flew out for an unofficial visit to Malaysia, said the embassy would deliver a message from Thai Premier Banharn Silpa-archa to Ranariddh and Hun Sen on the matter &quot;within the next few days&quot;.</p>
<p>He said he had not seen the contents of the letter.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and Hun Sen last week wrote to Banharn and asked for Thailand's help in finding, capturing and returning the Khmer Rouge fugitives.</p>
<p>Cambodia believes four or five senior Khmer Rouge hardliners escaped into Thailand on the capture of their northwest Samlaut base last week by dissident guerrillas loyal to Ieng Sary, foreign minister in the brutal 1977-79 Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot.</p>
<p>Ieng Sary broke with hardliners loyal to Pol Pot in August and has been negotiating peace with the government.</p>
<p>Ranariddh claimed on Saturday the Thais had captured one of the fugitives, but feared they would not send him to Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge fugitives are believed to include defence chief Son Sen and Pol Pot aide Nuon Chea.</p>
<p>Other reports have said up to five of the hardliners are being held by the dissident Khmer Rouge in their Pailin base, while Thai and rebel sources told Reuters on Monday the guerrillas were being sheltered by a Thai politician inside Thailand.</p>
<p>The Thai ambassador stressed that Thailand only recognised the authority of the royal Cambodian government and said border forces were under orders to prevent Khmer Rouge encroachments and intrusions from Cambodia.</p>
