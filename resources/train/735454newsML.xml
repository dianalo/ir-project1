<headline>Russians deny agency reports on Mir deadline.</headline>

<p>Space officials on Thursday denied Russian news agency reports that the crew of the damaged Mir space station would have to return to Earth if they did not fix the latest problem by 1000 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>Interfax and Itar-Tass quoted unnamed experts as saying the crew were trying to restore energy by using engines of the Soyuz escape capsule to keep Mir in line with the Sun. They said by 1000 GMT on Friday Soyuz would have only enough fuel to return home. But a Mission Control spokesman said: &quot;This does not correspond to reality.&quot;  </p>
<p>The latest problem hit Mir during the night from Wednesday to Thursday when one of the three-man Russian-U.S. crew mistakenly pulled out a vital computer cable, disrupting the power supply system and plunging the ship into its worst crisis since a near-fatal collision on June 25.</p>
<p>The power loss forced the crew to switch off most of Mir's systems, including light, heating and life-support systems on the main station. The cosmonauts had to to sit in their Soyuz escape capsule to communicate with Earth.</p>
<p>They now hope to accumulate enough energy in their batteries to try to restart the so-called gyrodine system, which keeps the station's solar batteries in line with the Sun without burning fuel.</p>
<p>A cargo craft which arrived at Mir last week delivered fuel supplies.</p>
