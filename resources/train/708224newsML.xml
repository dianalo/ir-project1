<title>HUNGARY: Central European bourses firm, quiet period seen.</title>
<headline>Central European bourses firm, quiet period seen.</headline>

<text>
<p>Central European bourses closed the week firmer with Zagreb the only laggard, but market participants doubted the upbeat tone could be held.</p>
<p>Bucharest rallied, while Budapest maintained its record- breaking form on foreign funds flowing into both markets.</p>
<p>Ljubljana strengthened after a central bank decision to relax rules for foreign investors, while Warsaw and Bratislava turned earlier modest gains to more significant rises.</p>
<p>The Central European Share Index (CESI), which follows price movements in 72 Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak and Slovenian shares, accelerated its rise on Friday to finish more than four percent firmer.</p>
<p>BUDAPEST</p>
<p>Hungarian share prices continued their bull run to new record levels this week, benefiting from expectations of lower domestic interest rates, expectations of steady interest rates in the U.S. and the approaching NATO summit in Madrid.</p>
<p>Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are expected to be invited to join NATO at the summit.</p>
<p>Some analysts said a growing amount of money was allocated to emerging markets, including Hungary, driving prices up, but a phase of stabilisation was still likely.</p>
<p>Other analysts said the Budapest Stock Exchange's short-term outlook remained positive despite recent strong gains but further out gains may be limited.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling that some of the corporate earnings growth is going to slow down in the second half of the year,&quot; said Andrew Thomson, head of European emerging markets research at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London.</p>
<p>PRAGUE</p>
<p>Czech blue chips led the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) higher this week. In spite of the gain dealers were pessimistic about the bearish sentiment plaguing the PSE.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals of the market have worsened and the effects of high interest rates will probably hit the bottom line of many companies,&quot; said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.</p>
<p>WARSAW</p>
<p>Polish shares rose 2.8 percent this week to 15,752.8 points but analysts said the mixed buying and selling after price fixing on Friday and continued low turnover suggested the market would lose steam next week.</p>
<p>The main market had fallen to near 15,000 points during this week's public offering of copper giant KGHM Polska Miedz before retracing.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems current gains represent a speculative rebound -- the market was so oversold...and the turnovers don't suggest the gains happened along with significant money,&quot; said Grzegorz Cimochowski, an analyst at ING Baring Securities in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Analysts said the approach of both mid-summer and the September 21 parliamentary elections would likely keep demand and the WIG index down in coming weeks.</p>
<p>BUCHAREST</p>
<p>Strong buying interest, mostly from big foreign investors, sent most Bucharest share prices to consecutive highs this week and traders expected the bullish phase to continue.</p>
<p>Three independent market indices, the VAB, the BIG and the CAS-SE, based on average prices and market capitalisation, touched record highs at all five sessions of the week.</p>
<p>LJUBLJANA</p>
<p>Slovenian shares jumped 15.6 percent this week bolstered by last week's decision of the central bank to relax rules for foreign investors. However, market participants feared the market could turn downhill after July 15 if parliament fails to amend the constitution in line with European Union(EU) standards.</p>
<p>&quot;That would bring uncertainty as political stability is very important to the capital market,&quot; said Predrag Stamenkovic, a trader at brokerage BPH. &quot;It could result in lower international interest in Slovenian shares for a certain period of time.&quot;</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court ordered parliament to change legislation to enable foreigners to buy land before it can ratify an association accord signed last year with the EU.</p>
<p>BRATISLAVA</p>
<p>The Bratislava Stock Exchange saw another week of listless trading, with brokers saying change for the better was unlikely during the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices (of shares) are pretty much volatile, on desperately low volumes, excluding any serious prediction at the moment,&quot; Libor Briska of Creditanstalt said.</p>
<p>The bourse has been in constant decline since the country's money market was paralysed by foreign speculation in May. The bourse has been also hard hit by a lack of liquidity as investors, put off by a murky market and political fears, have waited on the sidelines.</p>
<p>ZAGREB</p>
<p>Croatian stocks traded lower in sluggish business throughout the week and market participants foresaw further weakness in activity ahead of a summer season lull.</p>
<p>They singled out brewery Karlovacka pivovara, the current market favourite, as one of the few stocks likely to rise on the back of strong 1996 performance and expected future growth.</p>
