<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) bought by tender 25,000-tonnes of 87-octane leaded gasoline for June 18-22 delivery and is seeking a second cargo due to the five-day shutdown of the Cochin refinery last week, a source close to IOC said on Monday.</p>
<p>The first cargo was purchased at $43 per tonne above MidEast naphtha quotes, cost-and-freight (c-and-f) Bombay on the west coast, the source said.</p>
<p>The tender closed on June 5 and was valid for one day.  </p>
<p>&quot;The price is much better than when IOC bought the last time which was about $15 per tonne higher,&quot; the source said on IOC's last purchase by tender of 90,000-tonnes of 87-octane leaded gasoline for March delivery to the west coast.</p>
<p>But the source said the number of offers &quot;was not very good&quot;.</p>
<p>IOC had initially issued a tender for June 10-14 delivery but cancelled it due to poor response, traders said.  </p>
<p>IOC was now seeking a second gasoline cargo for June 26-30 delivery to the west coast because of a product shortfall caused by the emergency shutdown of the 150,000 barrel-per-day facility belonging to state refiner Cochin Refineries Ltd.</p>
<p>Production at the refinery, located on the southwest coast of India, stopped on June 5 due to water disruption to the refinery and resumed on Saturday.</p>
<p>As a result, IOC was short on gasoline and fuel oil and had issued tenders for both, closing on June 12 and valid for a day, the source said.</p>
