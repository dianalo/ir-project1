<p>Michael Jordan lectured Chicago Bulls management about loyalty Friday, saying he believed the players deserved a chance at another NBA championship and warning that breaking them up would send him to the golf course.</p>
<p>&quot;We're entitled to defend what we have until we lose it,&quot; a dead-serious Jordan said after the Bulls clinched their fifth NBA championship in the last seven years.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the opportunity to show that we're the greatest of all time, and the only way we can continue to prove that is to keep us together,&quot; Bulls co-captain Scottie Pippen said.</p>
<p>Jordan, the game's greatest player and the league's biggest draw, reiterated that he would quit rather than play for anyone other than Phil Jackson, Bulls coach for all five titles beginning with the 1990-91 season.</p>
<p>Jackson, who like Jordan had a one-year contract, and team general manager Jerry Krause have not commented on the Bulls' coaching situation for next year.</p>
<p>Jordan has also said the team's second star, Pippen, should not be traded ahead of his final contract year, as has been rumoured.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this team is entitled to an opportunity to continue to be successful. Sure, business has to be involved,&quot; Jordan said, sitting between the championship trophy and a magnum of champagne while clutching his victory cigar.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) there has to be some consideration, some sense of loyalty, to myself, to Scottie, to Phil, even to the guys who have given themselves over the last two years -- even Dennis (Rodman) for all the different colours he may wear in his hair or (his) dresses.</p>
<p>&quot;Rebuilding? Nobody is guaranteeing rebuilding is going to (take) two, three, four, five years,&quot; Jordan continued. &quot;The (Chicago) Cubs have been rebuilding for 42 years,&quot; he said, prompting laughter about the team with baseball's longest championship drought -- actually far longer than 42 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what it's going to take ... but I think we're entitled to defend what we have and Phil should be the head coach and I shouldn't have to make the decision to play for another coach,&quot; Jordan said.</p>
<p>&quot;Simple as that. Sad as it may be, I have choices, and I will not choose to play for another coach.&quot;</p>
<p>It may have been the afterglow of the Bulls' victory but both Jordan and Pippen urged team owner Jerry Reinsdorf to bring back Rodman, the controversial, madcap six-time NBA rebounding king, for a try at a sixth championship.</p>
<p>Rodman, who won two titles with the Detroit Pistons, Friday became the only player to win back-to-back championships with two different teams.</p>
<p>Besides mixed emotions concerning the oft-suspended Rodman, who was just fined $50,000 for his insulting comments about Utah's Mormons, Bulls' management must consider the twin factors of age and money.</p>
<p>Jordan is 34 years old and Rodman is 36, and they earned an estimated $30 million and $9 million respectively on one-year contracts that expire after this season.</p>
<p>Jackson also will not come cheap, given the hugely inflated going rate for big-name NBA coaches in the current market.</p>
<p>But reserve guard Steve Kerr, one of several bench players who brought the Bulls back in the fourth quarter and whose closing seconds basket secured the title-clinching win, said the team's future ought not to be complicated.</p>
<p>&quot;To me the decisions are not difficult,&quot; Kerr said.</p>
<p>&quot;You bring Michael, Scottie, Phil back and the question mark obviously is Dennis ... Personally I'd love to see him back, because I love Dennis and he's a huge part of our team.&quot;</p>
