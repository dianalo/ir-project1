<p>Perceptron Inc said Monday it expects revenue and earnings for the first quarter to be below expectations since certain shipments planned for the quarter are expected to be shipped in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Perceptron said bookings for the first quarter are expected to be more than double those received in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Order backlog, which stood at a record $21 million at the end of 1996, is expected to exceed $26 million at the end of the first quarter, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The nature of the company's business is such that revenues are largely generated through sizable orders from a small number of customers,&quot; Alfred Pease, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;As a result, the timing of orders can cause the company to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly revenues and operating results.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that, based on the current outlook, the second quarter of 1997 is expected to show a &quot;marked improvement&quot; over the first quarter and the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, we would expect the continued strong demand for our products to be reflected in our 1997 results,&quot; Pease said.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1996, Perceptron earned $0.27 a share on revenues of $11.7 million. In the first quarter of 1996, it earned $0.16 a share on sales of $9.1 million.</p>
<p>Perceptron designs, makes and markets information-based process measurement and guidance solutions for industry.</p>
