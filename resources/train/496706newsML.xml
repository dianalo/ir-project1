<p>Bank of China successfully re-entered international capital markets on Wednesday with its first issue in more than two years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bankers in Hong Kong said they expect Thailand to go forward with its Yankee bond this week despite receiving rating downgrades from Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>China's most influential state-owned commercial bank launched a US$300 million floating rate note due April 2004 that can be called at par after five years.</p>
<p>The notes pay a coupon of 37.5 basis points over the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate and were launched at 99.80 to give a discount margin of 41 basis points.</p>
<p>Fees are 35 basis points.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley International and Bank of China International were joint lead managers.</p>
<p>The issue is rated Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service and a notch lower at BBB by Standard and Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Moody's rates the sovereign at A3, while S&amp;P assesses China at BBB.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that the issue would have a tenor of five or seven years. As recently as a few days ago, bankers were betting that Bank of China would opt for a straight five-year on views that there would be more demand in that maturity.</p>
<p>Bankers speculated that a five-year bond would pay a margin in the low 30s, a few basis points tighter than Construction Bank of China's recent US$200 million issue.</p>
<p>Construction Bank's five-year FRN paid a fixed-reoffer yield of 33 basis points and an all-in of 37.5 basis points.</p>
<p>But syndicate managers involved in the Bank of China deal said they had no problem selling the seven-year callable paper.</p>
<p>&quot;The deal is paying about eight basis points more for the two-year extension and nobody can complain about that,&quot; said a syndicate manager at a European bank involved in the deal.</p>
<p>In addition to the two joint leads, 20 banks from the U.S., Europe and Asia joined in management roles.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, debt traders shrugged off news that Moody's Investors Service had downgraded Thailand's long-term foreign currency rating to A3 from A2.</p>
<p>&quot;The spreads widened when Moody's put Thailand on negative watch so the downgrade was pretty much priced in,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. bank in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Moody's also cut the senior debt and deposit ratings of five Thai banks to A3 from A2. The banks were Bangkok Bank, Export-Import Bank of Thailand, Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>Moody's affirmed the A3 subordinated debt ratings of Bangkok Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>Thailand's long-awaited Yankee bond still is expected to go forward later this week despite the Moody's move.</p>
<p>&quot;Thailand surely has known for days that Moody's was going to announce the downgrade, so if they were going to postpone the issue they would have done it earlier,&quot; said one banker.</p>
<p>There is some speculation that the US$500 million bond will have a 10-year maturity and will be priced to yield around 90 basis points over Treasuries, but this is not confirmed.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers are leading the Thailand deal.</p>
<p>PTT Exploration and Production said it still planned to issue US$200 million in bonds overseas despite its downgrade to A3 by Moody's.</p>
<p>The Yankee bond for the central bank of the Philippines is expected to come hot on the heels of the Thailand issue. Salomon is the lead.</p>
<p>In other news, bankers said state-owned Land Bank of Taiwan may scupper its plan to issue US$100 in floating rate certificates of deposit because it is unhappy with the pricing offered by arranging banks.</p>
