<p>West Indies captain Courtney Walsh paid tribute to fellow fast bowler Curtly Ambrose after he lifted the tourists to a six-wicket win in the third test against Australia on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ambrose risked aggravating a hamstring injury to silence his critics with an inspirational haul nine wickets in the match.</p>
<p>His efforts, hampered further by cramps in his legs, helped West Indies wrap up a remarkable victory inside three days at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>&quot;He knew the importance of the match and he was going to be out there regardless of what happened. His country needed him,&quot; Walsh said of his regular new-ball partner after the big Antiguan took four for 17 in Australia's second innings.</p>
<p>&quot;Curtly knew the position I was in. He led from the front and took a lot of pressure off the other bowlers.&quot;</p>
<p>The victory cut Australia's lead to 2-1 in the five-test series.</p>
<p>After routing Australia for 122 in their second innings on Saturday, West Indies reached their victory target of 87 just before the scheduled close of play for the loss of four wickets.</p>
<p>Ambrose, whose lacklustre performances in the first two tests yielded just three wickets at a dismal average of 93, finished with outstanding match figures of nine for 72.</p>
<p>Number three batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul calmed his side's nerves with a composed 40 to steer West Indies within sight of victory at the end of an eventful day during which 15 wickets fell.</p>
<p>After heavy defeats in the first two tests, West Indies must win in Adelaide and Perth to regain the Frank Worrell trophy.</p>
<p>&quot;Our backs were up against us and it was a very important match for us. It has put us back in the right direction and our confidence is now coming back,&quot; Walsh said.</p>
<p>Despite the victory, West Indies will remain concerned about the poor form of vice-captain and key batsman Brian Lara, who scored two in each innings.</p>
<p>The temperamental left-hander has amassed a paltry seven runs in his last four test innings, falling victim to Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath on each occasion.</p>
<p>West Indies, who resumed on 233 for nine on Saturday, scored 255 in their first innings after dismissing Australia for 219.</p>
<p>Australia captain Mark Taylor said his side still held the pyschological edge, adding that the uneven bounce in the pitch favoured the tourists' pace attack .</p>
<p>&quot;We are still leading 2-1 at this stage and I would have taken that position before the start of the series,&quot; he said.</p>
