<p>Russia's communists, trying to re-invigorate their public image, turned to Bolshevik-style rhetoric on Sunday in their battle against President Boris Yeltsin and his new government.</p>
<p>One resolution passed at their congress said the country was being turned into a &quot;semi-colony&quot; of international capitalism.</p>
<p>Others called for mass protests on May 1 and 9, which could lead to a general strike.</p>
<p>The communists, who have the biggest faction in the State Duma lower house, were meeting for their first congress since early 1993 and were quick to attack Yeltsin.</p>
<p>&quot;Political manouvering by the government, changes of ministers, endless promises and assurances cannot conceal the essense of the authorities' actions -- any government created by this regime will serve its goals of robbing the people,&quot; said one resolution.</p>
<p>The main task, it said, was &quot;to save Russia's statehood and the country itself which is being turned into a semi-colony in accordance with the will of international capital.&quot;</p>
<p>Some delegates criticised party leader Gennady Zyuganov for complacency and said he should be more combative.</p>
<p>Mikhail Mashkovtsev, delegate from the far eastern region of Kamchatka, urged Zyuganov to follow the example of the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and &quot;address the people both from a balcony and from an armoured car&quot;.</p>
<p>Activists were instructed to start collecting signatures in favour of ousting Yeltsin from power and of changing the constitution which gives the president immense powers at the expense of the legislature. Such petitions would have no legal power.</p>
<p>An appeal to Russians said: &quot;only struggle against the current regime can save the motherland -- the capitalist path along which the so-called reformers lead us is the way to nowhere, to a historical dead end.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the last communist congress, Yeltsin has crushed a rebellion in October 1993 by supporters of the old conservative parliament and defeated Zyuganov in the 1996 presidential poll.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has formed effectively a new government under veteran Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and given young reformers key positions in the cabinet.</p>
<p>So far the Duma has not risked considering a no-confidence vote. This would give Yeltsin a constitutional choice of dismissing either the cabinet -- which is unlikely -- or the legislature itself.</p>
<p>Reflecting this policy, a resolution passed by the congress said that the communist faction in the Duma could consider a no-confidence vote but an earlier proposal to put it firmly on the parliamentary agenda was deleted.</p>
<p>The communists appear to be losing their public appeal after defeat in the presidential poll last year.</p>
<p>Party sources have told Reuters the petition and other planned protests were aimed mainly at keeping the communists in the public eye.</p>
<p>Parliamentary polls are not due until 1999 and the next presidential election is set for the year 2000 but the main political forces are already eyeing their strategy.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the communists' tough rhetoric appeared to reflect their attempt to ride the wave of growing discontent aggravated by a huge backlog of salaries and pensions.</p>
