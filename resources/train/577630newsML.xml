<headline>SIMEX Nikkei futures end higher, gains precarious.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures were firmly back in positive territory at Monday's close as the dollar recovered from a near four-month low against the yen.</p>
<p>But dealers said the market might have difficulty extending or even sustaining its gains in the short term unless the dollar headed sharply higher again.</p>
<p>Nikkei 225 June futures ended up 275 points at 20,115 after falling to a low of 19,570 in early trade.  </p>
<p>A trader with a Japanese futures house said players turned wary of pushing the market down too aggressively and started covering short positions when strong selling interest failed to emerge on Nikkei cash and futures markets in Japan.</p>
<p>The dollar's recovery to around the 119 yen level from a low of 117.50 yen also helped underpin the market, but participants remained uncertain about the U.S. unit's direction in the face of a barrage of comments by Japanese officials.</p>
<p>The trader said the June Nikkei showed scope to come off and test support at 20,000 initially and then at 19,780 as the market still faced a stiff barrier around 20,300.  </p>
<p>SIMEX Taiwan index futures ended sharply lower in line with a decline in Taipei stocks due to political uncertainties and concerns about corporate earnings attaining projected levels.</p>
<p>The May MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 327.3 against its opening 342.0 after trading at a 13 points discount to the cash index at one stage. Volume was 954 lots.</p>
