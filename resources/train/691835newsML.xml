<p>Toronto's stock market finished a busy Friday on a weaker note, pressured by falling mining and bank sectors as investors shed issues before quarter's end.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index dipped 27.25 points to close at 6426.40. Turnover was heavy at 96.7 million shares valued at C$1.94 billion ($1.41 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;The resource sector's still in the doghouse,&quot; said Calgary, Alberta-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter.</p>
<p>A tumbling gold bullion price dragged Toronto's influential gold sector lower, Schachter said. The price of gold dropped $3.90 to $335.90 on New York's Comex.</p>
<p>Investors have been nervously selling underperforming issues including golds to re-balance portfolios before the end of the second quarter, Schachter said.</p>
<p>Precious metals fell 2.5 percent and led eight of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes lower, including banks and utilities, extending Thursday's weakness after an interest rate hike.</p>
<p>Conglomerates and industrial products were among the gainers.</p>
<p>Declining issues beat advancers 525 to 443, while 297 closed steady.</p>
<p>Canada's largest equities market ended the week about 66 points below its Monday opening of 6492.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, havyweight Barrick Gold Corp. shed 1.05 to 30.10 in brisk dealings of 1.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Transportation conglomerate Bombardier Inc. added 1.15 to 31 despite news that 30 of 121 inspected Canadair Regional Jets would require repairs. The inspections were ordered by Transport Canada in an emergency airworthiness directive that took effect on Thursday.</p>
<p>Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.30 to 62.85 in healthy trade. Canada's largest bank said it would offer C$27.50 ($19.80) a share to acquire London Insurance Group. for C$2.4 billion ($1.7 billion). London Insurance shares slipped 0.30 to 26.70.</p>
<p>Gold miner Placer Dome Inc. dropped 0.85 to 22.45 in active dealings amid more developments in the ownership controversy over the Las Cristinas gold deposit in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Rival miner Crystallex International Corp. rose 0.80 to 6.70 after it said senior Venezuelan officials had tried to promote a deal between the two to resolve the fight over the gold-rich concession. It declined to confirm or deny it was in talks with Placer.</p>
