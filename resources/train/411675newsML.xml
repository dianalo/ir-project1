<p>Finnish oil and energy group Neste Oy plans to expand its petrol station network in Russia despite ever tougher competition there, Neste's president and chief operating officer Jukka Viinanen said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expanding (the petrol station network) in the St Petersburg area as rapidly as the Russian authorities permit us to do so,&quot; Viinanen told a news conference after Neste reported 1996 profits down 59 percent on 1995 to 556 million markka. @</p>
<p>At end-January, Neste's service station network in Russia, Belarus, Poland and the Baltic republics comprised 86 stations, 21 of which were in Russia -- most of them in the St Petersburg area and nearby region, with three in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>Neste's network outside Finland had net sales of &quot;a good billion markka&quot; last year, a Neste spokeswoman said, but profit figures were not available.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as the Baltic region is concerned ... profitability has weakened because competition has grown tougher,&quot; Viinanen said, adding that Royal Dutch Shell and Norway's Statoil A/S had made powerful moves into all countries in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Profitability has weakened, but we are still in the black,&quot; Viinanen said.</p>
<p>Neste is also looking at the whole region of northwestern Russia as an opportunity to expand its network, but that region's low traffic densities limit the scope, Viinanen said. @</p>
<p>&quot;Though we are proceeding as quickly as possible in Russia, on the other hand we don't want to increase the pace terribly. We certainly recognize the risks associated with business in Russia,&quot; Viinanen said.</p>
<p>In addition to its 21 stations in Russia -- with two more under construction -- Neste had 23 in Estonia, 17 in Poland, 12 in Latvia, 10 in Lithuania and two in Belorus at end-January, a Neste spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The performance of Neste's petrol stations in Poland have been hampered by strict regulation, which only last month was lifted, and by fuel import duties, Viinanen said. @</p>
