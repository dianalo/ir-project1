<headline>Germany's SPD backs down on call for new election.</headline>

<p>Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) said on Tuesday they did not expect a snap election and that the next general election would take place at the end of September next year.</p>
<p>The SPD at the weekend called for new elections after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government stood by its controversial plans to revalue gold and currency reserves, despite Bundesbank opposition, to help Bonn plug yawning budget gaps.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the Bundestag (parliamentary) elections to take place at the end of September 1998,&quot; SPD parliamentary business manager Franz Muentefering told SFB Radio, indicating the SPD did not plan to press its demand for new elections.</p>
<p>He said a parliamentary majority would be needed to force new elections and this would not happen because of Kohl's 12-seat majority in the Bundestag lower house.</p>
<p>Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), said last month they wanted the next general election to be held on September 27, 1998. But the date will have to be agreed with other parties.</p>
<p>Muenterfering called on Kohl to come clean on Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plans to revalue Bundesbank assets to help Germany qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU), accusing him of dodging the issue so far.</p>
<p>Muenterfering said Kohl would have a chance to do this in a parliamentary debate on Wednesday when the opposition SPD and Greens have tabled a motion calling for Waigel's dismissal.</p>
<p>&quot;This motion is not directed at the chancellor himself. The chancellor must act. The question is: where has he been during all these events?&quot; Muenterfering said. &quot;He (Kohl) must say whether he is going to act on recent events or not&quot;.</p>
<p>Muenterfering said that if elections were held now,  Kohl's coalition would be over.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the coalition) are politically and in terms of organisation completely done for. It's no longer a pleasant drama and it's also bad for the country, nonetheless I do expect the next parliamentary election in autumn next year.&quot;</p>
