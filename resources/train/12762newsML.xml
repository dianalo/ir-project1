<headline>Kuwait paper says it received bomb threat.</headline>
<dateline>KUWAIT 1996-08-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Kuwait newspaper reported on Saturday it received a bomb threat following faxed statements critical of its writing on Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;I will blow up your newspapers,&quot; the Arabic daily Watan quoted one of three faxes it received on Friday as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Watan; you cannot write about Israel and America. You fear. Cowards,&quot; the privately owned newspaper quoted a message faxed to the paper earlier the same day as saying.</p>
<p>Another read: &quot;To the chief editor and journalists, media should be set against the real enemy, Israel and its allies. The pen weapon should not write what would divide Arabs and Moslems.&quot;</p>
<p>The paper said it did not know how serious the threat was, but noted it would have no bearing on its position.</p>
<p>Watan's editorial position on the U.S. and Israel is widely seen as moderate. Many Islamist columnists write for the paper, which runs a weekly supplement promoting Islamic values.</p>
<p>Washington is Kuwait's closest Western ally after it led an international coalition in 1991 to end Iraq's occupation of the Gulf Arab state.</p>
<p>Kuwait has said it would not normalise relations with Israel until there was a full comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.</p>
