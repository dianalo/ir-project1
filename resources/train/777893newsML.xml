<title>USA: GTE offers new business long-distance plan.</title>
<headline>GTE offers new business long-distance plan.</headline>

<p>In a bid to boost its presence in the business long-distance market, GTE Corp, said Tuesday it will offer a calling plan that guarantees telephone long-distance rates will get less expensive over time.</p>
<p>The company said that under its new Value Plan, business customers can sign up for a flat per-minute rate and see the rate drop a penny per minute for each of the next two years.</p>
<p>First-year rates start at $0.12 per minute and apply to direct-dialed calls as well as toll-free, operator-assisted and credit card calls carried by GTE Long Distance. Calls are billed in six-second increments after the first 18 seconds.  </p>
<p>Stamford, Conn.-based GTE is a top local phone service provider that has entered the U.S. long distance business in recent years. The company claimed approximately 1.3 million long-distance customers in mid-1997, but most of them were residential long distance subscribers, a GTE spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know how challenging understanding long-distance plans can be,&quot; Rob McCoy, president of GTE's Long Distance unit, said. &quot;Many business customers are taken in by attractive per- minute rates without realizing that those rates often balloon after the first couple of months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;With GTE's plan, long-distance rates go down automatically -- you don't even have to ask,&quot; McCoy said.</p>
<p>GTE's Value Plan has no monthly fee, but requires a three- year commitment.</p>
<p>Industry analyst Jeffrey Kagan said that GTE's move was part of an industry trend to focus on retaining valuable customers instead of acquiring large numbers of customers with varying degrees of loyalty.</p>
<p>He compared GTE's Value Plan to Sprint Corp's own efforts to retain small and medium-sized business customers with a &quot;Free Fridays&quot; promotion, which gives customers who sign up free calls on the last day of the work week.</p>
