<p>Slovenian shares fell on Tuesday as investors stood behind the line, waiting for the country's post-election political situation to become clearer.</p>
<p>The 10-share SBI index fell 19.74 points to 1,145.6. Overall 11 shares fell, two rose and two remained unchanged, while another nine were untraded. Turnover rose to 110.9 million tolars from 78.4 million.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just a correction phase, which right now does not change foreign investors' positive view of Slovenia's economy,&quot; said Fritz Schweiger, head of equity research at Investmentbank Austria in Vienna.</p>
<p>The final official results of general election on November 10 gave ruling Liberal Democrats 25 seats in 90 seat parliament.</p>
<p>The rightist &quot;Spring&quot; alliance comprising three parties received a total of 45 seats. Analysts predicted a fall in prices if the protectionist &quot;Spring Parties&quot; come to power.</p>
<p>Traders forecast turnover would continue to rise after shares in port Luka Koper's debuted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bank SKB was the most actively traded share, falling 4.05 percent to close at 41,030 tolars on volume of 1,274 shares for total turnover of 52.6 million tolars.</p>
<p>Traders said SKB's fall was a technical reaction to recent strong gains.</p>
<p>Dolenjska bank preferred shares led the day's decliners, falling 10.17 percent or 1,280 tolars to 11,300 tolars on volume of 121 shares.</p>
<p>Brokerage Dadas was the biggest gainer, rising 6.28 percent to 9,990 tolars on volume of 44 shares. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
