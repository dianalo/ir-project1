<title>RUSSIA: Russia's UES plans convertible eurobond.</title>

<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-10-31</dateline>

<p>National power company Unified Energy System (UES) will issue a Eurobond convertible into 7.5 percent of its shares in the first half of December, privatisation minister Alfred Kokh said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the fastest we can manage,&quot; said Kokh, whose official title is Chairman of the State Property Committee.  </p>
<p>Kokh did not give any details of the planned issue.</p>
<p>In August the government appointed CS First Boston adviser to coordinate the sale of the shares, which was to be sold in four regional tranches.</p>
<p>It said ABN AMRO Rothschild would be joint lead manager for the European tranche, CS First Boston would lead the North American tranche, Flemings would lead the Asian tranche, and Bank MFK and Bank Menatep would lead the Russian tranche.</p>
<p>But Kokh said the issue would not be divided up strictly on these regional lines, but sold where demand was strongest.</p>
<p>&quot;The use of the word tranche is not appropriate. Rather, these are general directions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Eurobonds will be transferred from region to region in line with demand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kokh said the bond issue would raise a large part of the 8-12 trillion roubles ($1.5-$2.2 billion) the government hopes to receive this year from privatising the UES stake, a 25 percent stake in telecoms holding company AO Svyazinvest, and the transfer of government stakes in companies to the regions.</p>
<p>At 1345 GMT UES was $0.0811 after $0.0809 at Wednesday's close.  </p>
<p>That would value a 7.5 percent stake at about $260 million.</p>
<p>The government intends to keep a stake of 51 percent in RAO Yedinaya Energeticheskaya Sistema Rossii (UES) until the end of 1998.</p>
<p>UES owns 29 power plans and holds 49 percent stakes in most of Russia's 72 regional &quot;energo&quot; power utilities. It is Russia's biggest company by sales and employees.</p>
<p>It is also one of its biggest by market capitalisation, and one of Russia's most liquid shares.</p>
<p>Foreigners own about 20 percent of the company, and UES President Anatoly Dyakov has spoken out against an increase in foreign ownership.</p>
