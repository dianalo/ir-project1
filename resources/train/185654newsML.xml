<p>Animal rights campaigners launched a campaign on Wednesday against the sale of kangaroo meat in Britain, saying that the trade is cruel and the meat poses a threat to human health.</p>
<p>The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said it planned to picket the head office of Tesco Plc in London and was urging its supporters around the country to lobby their local supermarkets not to sell the meat.</p>
<p>&quot;Kangaroo meat is being touted as a new wonder meat... However, it may cause even more health problems as well as causing gross cruelty to millions of kangaroos and their young,&quot; IFAW said in a news release.</p>
<p>The IFAW says thousands of baby kangaroos, or joeys, are killed every night in Australia, so that hunters can track down their mothers for their meat.</p>
<p>It says the joeys are bashed against trees or crushed to death underfoot and then left because they are not used for human consumption.</p>
<p>Tesco denied that such practices were used to obtain the kangaroo meat it sells.</p>
<p>&quot;Our kangaroo meat forms part of an annual cull authorised by the Australian government,&quot; a Tesco spokeswoman said. Trained marksmen were used to hunt its kangaroo meat, she added.</p>
<p>The IFAW also said that kangaroo meat could carry diseases such as Toxoplasmosis and the Orbi virus.</p>
<p>The Orbi virus could cause meningitis and encephalitis in humans, IFAW quoted Australian veterinary patholoist, Dr David Obendorf, as saying.</p>
<p>Tesco said it followed stringent quality controls to ensure that its meat was not infected and insisted it posed no threat to humans.</p>
<p>Kangaroo meat has been on sale at 300 Tesco supermarkets across Britain since the company launched its line of kangaroo steaks and burgers in August.</p>
<p>The supermarket group said it had no intention of removing it from its shelves. &quot;Kangaroo meat has been well received. It is very much an on-going line.&quot; a Tesco spokeswoman said.</p>
