<p>Metals markets spiralled lower on Monday, overwhelmed by gloomy sentiment as speculators battered prices once again.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Aluminium tumbled to a fresh 2-1/4-year low, tin touched a six-month nadir and copper, flagship of the industrial metals, slid further below a key level of support, although it found some support late in the day.</p>
<p>Copper, the most activiely traded of the industrial metals, continued to erode lower after losing grip of the key $1,900 level late on Friday. It ended the morning down $33 at $1,867 before staging an afternoon rally to close at $1,883..</p>
<p>The market peaked at $2,715 in May, but is starting to feel the weight of growing output from new mines, which is expected to accelerate in 1997, and speculators are taking advantage of the weakness, analysts said.</p>
<p>Speculators also kept up the pressure on the precious metals complex.</p>
<p>Platinum fixed at $386.50 per ounce, the lowest level in nearly 2-1/4 years as steady sales from major producer Russia eroded confidence since the summer when prices were above $400.</p>
<p>Sharp losses in silver last week spread a chill throughout the precious metals.</p>
<p>Platinum's stablemate palladium crumbled to fresh three-year lows, fixing at $116.75 per ounce, down from $122 last week.</p>
<p>GOLD</p>
<p>New York precious metals futures ended higher Monday, with the exception of palladium, but volumes were light due to the Yom Kippur holiday. But precious metals remain in a three week downtrend, with little sign of a bounce, though technical indicators look oversold, analysts said. COMEX December gold ended up 50 cents at $384.40 an ounce, after trading in a $383.80-384.70 range, following Friday's slide to a three year low for the December contract at $383.30. In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $381.50/382.00, from the London afternoon fix at $381.00, and Friday's New York close at $381.75 which was a two month low.</p>
<p>WHEAT</p>
<p>Short covering amid signals the market was oversold boosted CBOT wheat futures to a higher close as did firm soft red winter cash wheat markets and commercial bull spreading, traders said. Traders said the wheat market had been hit hard recently and was in an oversold mode technically. Wheat weather got mixed reviews with some saying the rain will delay seedings and others saying the moisture will help boost growth prospects of the 1997 U.S. winter wheat crop. Wheat futures closed 1-1/2 to six cents per bushel higher, with December up 5-1/2 cents at $4.26-1/2 a bushel. In wheat options, Continental Grain bought 300 December $5.00 calls at one cent, the traders said.</p>
<p>World barley markets were holding steady while attention was being focused on the emerging details of a huge 1.4 million tonnes purchase by Saudi Arabia, an influential importer.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX crude oil trimmed most of its earlier losses in light afternoon trade Monday, with its sideways fortunes defined by a strong distillate market and a weak gasoline market, traders said. &quot;Crude oil's caught between a strong heating oil market and a gasoline market that's weak,&quot; said Thomas Blakeslee, analyst at Cargill Investor Services in New York. At 1341 EDT/1741 GMT, November crude stood three cents lower at $23.19 a barrel. November crude held technical support at $22.85 a barrel before it began trimming its losses, traders said.</p>
<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>CSCE world sugar ended modestly higher in quiet trading Monday, bolstered by steady buying from both speculators and the trade, dealers said. After surviving an early-session test of key chart support levels, prices sprang back into positive territory and remained there for the rest of the day. Good trade buying of October and on the nearby October-March switch was noted, as well as commission-house interest in the deferreds.</p>
<p>Views that the market was substantially oversold contributed to today's gains, dealers said. Most-active March futures have fallen by about half a cent since hitting contract highs at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>March rose 0.06 cent per lb, to 11.27, having traded from 11.17 to 11.28. Spot October gained 0.11, to 11.30, retaking its premium to the deferreds.  </p>
