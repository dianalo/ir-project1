<title>USA: Rains further slow harvesting in western Corn Belt.</title>
<headline>Rains further slow harvesting in western Corn Belt.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rains falling in the western Corn Belt on Tuesday should slow further already-belated corn and soybean harvesting although the outlook is drier further east, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rain they are getting in the western Corn Belt is slowing them down (harvesting corn and soybeans). The east (Corn Belt) is not that bad,&quot; said Joel Burgio, agricultural meteorologist with Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>Burgio said the rains currently spreading through the western Corn Belt should bring 0.25 to 0.50 inch of rain to Nebraska, Iowa, northern Missouri and northwest Illinois.  </p>
<p>The rain-bearing system was seen moving north and east, skirting northern Indiana and moving into Michigan with 0.30 to 1.00 inch of precipitation, locally heavier, Burgio said.</p>
<p>In the southeast Corn Belt there will be scattered showers of 0.10 to 0.50 inch late Tuesday and into Wednesday but overall rainfall should be light, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The eastern extremes of the belt will not see significant precipitation until tonight. Rainfall will be 0.30 to 1.50 inches with the bias of heavier amounts across Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin,&quot; Smith Barney meteorologist Jon Davis wrote in his daily weather outlook.  </p>
<p>The rain will be followed by a drop in temperatures, with the western Corn Belt turning colder during the day on Wednesday and the eastern belt late Wednesday and early Thursday, Burgio of Weather Services Corp said.</p>
<p>Lows on Thursday night will be in single digits Fahrenheit in the northwest Corn Belt and mid 20s (F) in the southeast Corn Belt, he added. However, little snow is expected.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a chance for snow flurries late Wednesday in the northwest part of the belt but moisture will be dissipating by the time the cold weather comes in,&quot; Burgio said.</p>
<p>Conditions should be mostly fair Friday but light to moderate showers were forecast in the western Corn Belt on Saturday and the eastern belt Sunday and Monday. Rainfall should total 0.25 to 0.75 inches, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fieldwork activity will resume later this week into the weekend. By late Sunday, a weak front will impose slight nominal delays on the northern reaches of the belt,&quot; Davis of Smith Barney wrote in his daily outlook.</p>
<p>The U.S. corn harvest was 45 percent complete, as of Sunday, below a five-year average of 60 percent, while soybean harvesting was 73 percent finished, lagging the normal 81 percent, USDA figures issued Monday showed.</p>
