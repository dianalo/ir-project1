<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan faces an opposition challenge to his rule next week for a fiasco in Libya that analysts predicted on Wednesday would tarnish but not topple the Islamist-led coalition.</p>
<p>The left wing has called for a censure motion against Erbakan for leaving Turkey open to scathing attacks from both his hosts and Ankara's close ally Washington after a trip to Libya at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The assembly is likely to meet next week to discuss the motion,&quot; a parliament official told Reuters. MPs will probably debate the visit next Tuesday and decide on the same day whether to hold a vote of censure against Erbakan later, he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister has been hammered in Turkey for allowing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi to openly encourage Kurdish separatism in Turkey at a joint news conference with Erbakan.</p>
<p>And Turkey's NATO partner the United States has turned on Erbakan for backing Gaddafi over charges of sponsoring terrorism against the West.</p>
<p>Erbakan would have to resign after little more than three months as modern Turkey's first Islamist leader if he lost the vote. He has 281 MPs, five more than the number needed to guarantee victory in the censure vote.</p>
<p>MPs in his pro-Western True Path Party coalition ally are uneasy with the Libya visit, part of Erbakan's bid to take Moslem but secular Turkey closer to the Islamic and Arab world.</p>
<p>But analysts said the dissenters in the government would probably prop up Erbakan, if only for the lack of someone to immediately replace him. Turkey's secularist politicians are split into half a dozen feuding groups.</p>
<p>&quot;Toppling the government before finding an alternative would only open the door to new problems,&quot; columnist Derya Sazak wrote in the Milliyet daily.</p>
<p>However, Erbakan is in for a rough ride at next week's debate.</p>
<p>&quot;Erbakan will have to give an account in parliament for the scandal,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The people are waiting...to hear Erbakan explain how he sunk so low in front of Gaddafi.</p>
<p>Gaddafi called for the establishment of a Kurdish state, presumably on Turkish soil, as Erbakan sat in awkward silence near the Libyan leader in a Bedouin tent in the city of Sirte.</p>
<p>Erbakan was defiant after arriving in Turkey early on Wednesday. &quot;We have returned like victorious Roman commanders,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted him as saying at Ankara airport.</p>
<p>He said he had later explained to Gaddafi Turkey's need to combat separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels.</p>
<p>Despite the row, Tripoli agreed to pay part of $365 million in outstanding debts to Turkish contractors who had worked on infrastructure projects in Libya, Turkey's Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>Erbakan had angered Washington, which regards Libya as a rogue state, by saying in Sirte that Libya was &quot;against terrorist activities&quot; and was &quot;the country suffering most from terror&quot;.</p>
<p>The State Department accused him on Monday of &quot;taking pot shots&quot; at America with &quot;objectionable remarks&quot; in Libya. It was the second U.S. rebuke in two days for Erbakan.</p>
