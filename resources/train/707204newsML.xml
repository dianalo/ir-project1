<p>A spot of do-it-yourself electrical wiring around the house is a finicky job at the best of times.</p>
<p>So imagine doing it in a pair of super-thick winter gloves and some really bulky clothing -- wearing an outsize aqualung and a motorcycle helmet. Under water... At night.</p>
<p>It may sound impossible, but that is effectively the challenge that will face the two Russian cosmonauts on the crippled Mir space station when they try to repair damage that has cut their electricity supply by up to half and place the future of the world's only manned orbital station in doubt.</p>
<p>Little wonder they decided on Friday they would need a full fortnight to practise, instead of the week originally remaining, before making a space walk on July 17 or 18. The task is to mend wiring that was severed when one of the station's modules was holed in a collision on June 25 and had to be sealed off.</p>
<p>At Zvyozdny Gorodok (Star City), the cosmonaut training centre outside Moscow, Mir's deputy mission chief Sergei Krikalyov donned a cumbersome spacesuit on Friday, similar to those his colleagues will use in space, and began testing repair techniques in a swimming pool.</p>
<p>The long preparations for an operation Krikalyov describes as &quot;risky&quot;, even for highly trained and experienced cosmonauts, underline how hard it will be to perform the delicate task in cramped conditions and in the absence of either air or gravity.</p>
<p>Mir commander Vasily Tsibliyev, 43, and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin, 39, have both had years of training in such suits, as has British-born American physicist Michael Foale, 40, who will man the station's escape capsule during the repairs.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev made five spacewalks in 1993, and on April 29 made the first joint Russian-U.S. spacewalk with Foale's NASA predecessor on Mir. This is Lazutkin's maiden flight.</p>
<p>Krikalyov, already clad in a close-fitting bright blue jump suit and light helmet, did not so much put on the clumsy looking spacesuit as climb through a hatch into the back of it.</p>
<p>The suit itself, silver and covered in gadgets, topped by an all-in-one space helmet, stood up on its own even with no one inside.</p>
<p>Once strapped in and carrying a bulky backpack, Krikalyov was winched like an unprotesting giant lobster into the training pool at Star City.</p>
<p>Once in the water to simulate weightlessness, he made some practice entries into various submerged mock-ups of parts of the Mir station, being guided by frogmen like a crippled whale.</p>
<p>Krikalyov strained to pass through a narrow entrance -- the way into Mir's punctured Spektr scientific module, where the rewiring is needed, is only 80 cm (31 inches) wide.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev and Lazutkin must reconnect 10 electric cables from Spektr's solar panels and feed them through a special airlock panel to be fitted in the module's door. Krikalyov said one of his worries was that some cables were hard to reach.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev expressed concern on Thursday, telling Mission Control: &quot;We'd like recommendations from you as soon as possible about how we can work in such cramped conditions in spacesuits. We have loads of cable around here and lots of piping.&quot;</p>
<p>Flight director Vladimir Solovyov, however, told reporters on Friday the cosmonauts were aware of the necessity of the job.</p>
<p>&quot;The sortie to Spektr is no more dangerous than a spacewalk,&quot; he said. &quot;We're not going to send the cosmonauts like lambs to the slaughter.&quot;</p>
<p>If it goes wrong, they may have to dash for the Soyuz lifeboat and head for Earth, effectively ending Mir's 11-year orbit. That would hinder preparations for the new international space station Alpha and create a risk the 140-tonne Mir station will come crashing back down on some built-up area of the planet.</p>
