<title>BOSNIA: Explosions reported at British base in Bosnia.</title>
<headline>Explosions reported at British base in Bosnia.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Four explosive devices were lobbed into the car park of a British base in the Bosnian Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka overnight, Western officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>British peacekeeping soldiers fired warning shots and detained several suspects after the incident, said the officials, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Initial reports indicated no one was seriously injured and that the devices were probably hand grenades.</p>
<p>A NATO officer in Sarajevo confirmed that the small British base in northwestern Banja Luka reported several small explosions caused by three to four &quot;intruders&quot;. He said more details would be available later in the day.</p>
<p>The attack marked the fourth explosion in four days in apparent retaliation for a NATO swoop last week on two Serbs indicted for war crimes.</p>
<p>Previous blasts targeted international monitors with the United Nations or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p>None of the bombings have caused injuries.</p>
<p>British special forces arrested one war crimes suspect and shot dead another who resisted arrest last Thursday in Prijedor, near Banja Luka. Both men were wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>A U.S. soldier suffered minor injuries on Wednesday when a man cut him with a hand-sickle in northeast Bosnia. The incident was still under investigation and NATO said it was unclear if the attack was connected to the bombings.</p>
