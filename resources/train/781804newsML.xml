<p>An aluminium rally on the London Metal Exchange (LME), which created backwardation, cut the metal's premiums for Japan ahead of talks later this month for fourth-quarter deliveries, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Possible buyers have disappeared because of the backwardation (on the LME),&quot; said a trader at one of Japan's major trade houses. &quot;Some are offering premiums as low as $75, though l doubt deals can be struck below $80.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader added: &quot;With such backwardation, you can't cover interest rates and storage costs.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said aluminium premiums stood at $85/90 per tonne -- well below the $100 of only two weeks ago -- while there were few buyers ahead of the fourth-quarter talks for term contracts.</p>
<p>Traders said they hoped the fourth-quarter premiums would fall from the $86 to $90 seen in the third quarter, particularly as the seasonal peak is over.</p>
<p>&quot;It all depends on the level of the backwardation and real demand. But premiums are likely to come down, though I don't think they'll fall by as much as $20.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said while domestic demand was set to decline towards the end of this year in reaction to a surge ahead of a sales tax increase in Japan in April, there were few clear signs to gauge the size of the downturn.</p>
<p>Aluminium stocks in Yokohama fell to below 130,000 tonnes at the end of June, they said, adding that the level seemed to have fallen further during July.</p>
<p>Both the physical copper and zinc markets remained quiet ahead of many plant closures during Japan's &quot;Obon&quot; holidays in mid-August, traders said.</p>
<p>Premiums for Chinese special high grade (SHG) zinc were seen unchanged at $20-30 per tonne, they said. Copper premiums were also flat at $50-60.</p>
<p>Zinc traders said domestic demand remained strong, though they were worried about a possible decline in Japanese car exports, which so far have offset weak domestic demand following the April 1 sales tax increase.</p>
<p>Their worries were heightened last week when U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said the U.S. automotive trade deficit with Japan was getting worse and criticised Tokyo for falling short in fulfilling an agreement to open its market.</p>
<p>In response to Barshefsky, Takao Tominaga of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said exports would not continue to grow sharply as Japan makers plan to start producing sports-utility vehicles in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;We're watching how car exports fare in the second half,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The industry might restrict exports itself.&quot;</p>
<p>One copper trader said: &quot;Demand from the cable industry is not very good. Exports for China and other Asian countries don't look as good as before. The currency crisis in some of Southeast Asian countries does not help either.&quot;</p>
