<p>The Central Bank said on Wednesday it was cutting the guaranteed dollar yield to non-residents investing in Russian Treasury bills to 11.0 percent as of June 2 from 12.5 percent currently.</p>
<p>The move, part of a gradual liberalisation of the government securities market, will be accompanied by a cut in the proportion of foreign exchange forward deals which banks handling non-resident accounts must offset with the Central Bank, it said in a statement. From June 2 banks will only have to offset 20 percent of non-residents' cash rouble purchases to buy T-bills with the Central Bank instead of 40 percent, said the statement from the head of the bank's currency division.</p>
<p>The proportion of non-residents' forward rouble sales to repatriate profits from T-bills which must be offset falls to 40 percent from 50 percent.</p>
<p>These compensatory deals allow the Central Bank to influence the rates which commercial banks offer non-residents, and hence the overall return which non-residents can obtain.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has said it would gradually reduce and virtually eliminate these restrictions by the beginning of next year to allow non-residents equal access to the market.</p>
<p>At the same time, the guaranteed minimum yield will be abandoned. Foreigners can already make substantially higher profits through active trading of T-bills.</p>
<p>The current rouble yield for T-bills averages about 27 percent.</p>
