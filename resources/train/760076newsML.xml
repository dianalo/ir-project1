<p>A 22-year-old man who was acquitted five years ago of shooting his parents to death shot and killed his brother and three other men Saturday as they watched television, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Fort Wayne Police Sgt. Nancy Becher said Joseph Corcoran admitted to investigators that he walked into the living room Saturday night and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle because he thought the victims were talking about him.</p>
<p>Among the dead were his 30-year-old brother James and his sister Kelly Nieto's fiance Robert Turner, 32, and two friends. One of the victims apparently tried to flee but was shot to death in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Corcoran was acquitted five years ago of shooting his parents to death in their home at nearby Ball Lake. A Steuben County jury found a lack of evidence in that case.</p>
<p>Becher said neither alcohol nor drugs were believed involved in the latest shooting.</p>
<p>Police found up to 35 weapons, including shotguns and automatic weapons, in the home Corcoran shared with his sister and her 7-year-old daughter. Detectives planned to interview the daughter, who was unharmed, but believe she was upstairs during the shooting, Becher said.</p>
<p>Corcoran appeared in Allen County Court on Monday to face four counts of first-degree murder and was ordered held without bond.</p>
