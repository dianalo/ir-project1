<title>UK: Enterprise Oil indicated up after results.</title>
<headline>Enterprise Oil indicated up after results.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-13</dateline>

<p>Shares in Enterprise Oil Plc were indicated higher in pre-market trade on Thursday, boosted by an increase in the company's production forecast for 1999 and a dividend at the top end of expectations.</p>
<p>Enterprise announced pre-tax profits of 142.5 million stg, at the bottom of the range of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>But dealers said a dividend of 17p, a penny higher than most expectations, and an increase in the production forecast for 1999 to 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 300,000, had lifted the stock. It was up 17-1/2p at 651 by 0810 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The headline profits may not have been spectacular but they had a fairly bullish statement and raised their output forecasts,&quot; one market-maker said.  </p>
<p>Tony Alves, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, said the results were &quot;excellent&quot; and he would maintain his buy recommendation on the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;The profits may have been a little below forecasts but they are old news by the time they're announced,&quot; he said. &quot;The things that impressed me were the reserve replacement, and the finding cost of 99p a barrel. It makes LASMO look extremely ordinary.&quot;</p>
<p>Alves said the increase in the 1999 output target also stood out. &quot;That was very encouraging,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Enterprise quashed recent stock market rumours by saying it was not planning any bids for Monument Oil and Gas Plc or British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate Plc, but Alves said this was no surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;I never believed for a moment they would bid for Monument,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought there was a slight chance they could bid for British-Borneo, but it's not the right time.&quot;</p>
<p>One dealer called the results &quot;a cracking set of figures&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Replacement reserves were excellent and cost control is excellent, and the forecast increase in production is much bigger than expected,&quot; he said.</p>
