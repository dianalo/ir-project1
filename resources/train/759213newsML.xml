<p>Northern Ireland peace talks adjourned for a summer recess on Monday, facing new storms over the surrender of guerrilla arms when they begin the search for a lasting settlement in September.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein, political wing of IRA guerrillas, met British officials for the first time since a week-old IRA truce entered force and urged their unionist rivals not to quit the talks because of a row over &quot;arms decommissioning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see the unionists there. If they are not, the door should be left ajar for them, but we should proceed anyway,&quot; Sinn Fein Vice President Pat Doherty told reporters.</p>
<p>The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the main voice of pro-British Protestants, has rejected Anglo-Irish proposals to discuss arms surrender at the sime time as a political settlement and wants guarantees arms will be handed over.</p>
<p>It has remained in the negotiations but two smaller unionist parties walked out last week, accusing Britain of seeking to appease the IRA at any price to get Sinn Fein involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Political sources said there was little prospect of the UUP joining the start of substantive talks on September 15 so long as there was no requirement on the Irish Republican Army to start handing over its arsenal.</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland hold ministerial talks in Dublin on Tuesday to try to ensure that the row between unionists and Sinn Fein over the surrender of arms does not hold up the opening of substantive talks in September.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein, which seeks the end of British rule of Northern Ireland, will be allowed to join the negotiations in September if the ceasefire by its IRA allies is judged genuine by Britain.</p>
<p>Doherty said his delegation pressed for the transfer of 30-odd IRA prisoners to British jails and the release of hundreds more in Irish cells in the party's first talks with British government officials since the IRA's July 20 truce.</p>
<p>Britain banned all contact with Sinn Fein when the IRA broke a 17-month truce in February last year but Doherty said he expected to meet British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam next week in the aftermath of the IRA ceasefire.</p>
<p>Doherty's delegation was present at the last session of the slow-moving talks for bilateral discussions but is barred from taking part until the IRA truce is judged credible by Britain.</p>
<p>It says decommissioning should not be allowed to hold up negotiation of new constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland which it sees as a step to a reunited Ireland.</p>
<p>But the UUP says Sinn Fein must prove that the IRA's war is permanently over by getting the IRA to hand over some arms.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said in a weekend television interview: &quot;There's no possibility -- and the IRA have made this very clear -- of them surrendering their weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>Mowlam said on Monday there had been some scaling down of security measures in response to the IRA ceasefire, including the withdrawal of British army protection for some police patrols.</p>
<p>Police said they had not ruled out sectarianism as a motive for the weekend killing of 16-year-old Catholic youth James Morgan, whose body was found in a fields near the village of Clough, some 25 miles (40 km) south of Belfast.</p>
<p>A man was charged with the murder when he appeared in court at Downpatrick, south of Belfast.</p>
<p>Loyalists, mirror-opposites of the IRA, are supposed to be observing an October 1994 ceasefire but a breakaway group has threatened to keep fighting what it sees as a Catholic-backed plot to end Northern Ireland's British status.</p>
