<p>Vietnam's foreign creditors will get a chance this week to sift through the fine print of a debt restructuring deal hammered out last year, the co-chairman of the country's Bank Advisory Committee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is planned either today or tomorrow that the so-called term sheet for the London Club debt will be sent out to the various creditors,&quot; Rollo Prendergast, regional head for Global Structured Finance at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Vietnam and its commercial creditors unveiled a framework agreement on the roughly $900 million of debt last May.</p>
<p>Settlement on the basis of that agreement now has to be agreed on case by case with creditors, most of which are Japanese banks that lent to Vietnam in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>The London Club is an informal group of commercial banks that holds discussions on an ad hoc basis on loan problems with a particular debtor nation.</p>
<p>Under the Brady bond-style deal, creditors have a choice of recovering principle through a 50 percent discount bond or a par bond, both backed by U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds bought by Vietnam.</p>
<p>At the time, some creditors complained that a 50-percent write-off was too generous given the recovery in the communist country's economic fortunes in the past five years.</p>
<p>However, Prendergast said there had been very few comments from creditors on the deal.</p>
<p>He declined to speculate on whether individual creditors may opt out of the deal and sue Vietnam in the hope of getting more favourable terms, as one is believed to have done already.</p>
<p>Prendergast said the price of Vietnam's debt on the secondary market had risen to around 98 percent of face value from around 80 when the framework deal was signed.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't take the price independently of global movements in the price of bond markets, which have moved up anyway,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to say whether it's a signal from the markets that they're happy, that they like it, or whether it just reflects the general movement of bond prices. It's a mixture of both is our guess.&quot;</p>
