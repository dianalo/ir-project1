<headline>OPTIONS - US bond vols uptick as futures slump.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>Implied volatilities for U.S. Treasury bond options moved fractionally higher late Monday as the underlying futures ended near their sessions lows.</p>
<p>June volatility in the 108-00 straddle finished the day at 8.84 percent, up from 8.40 percent at Friday's settlement and slightly above levels of 8.50-8.60 percent seen for most of the session.</p>
<p>Treasury bond options traders said implied volatilities continued to reflect the market's range-bound status, with any values below 9.00 percent considered quite low.  </p>
<p>June T-bond futures ended at 107-21, one tick above the day's low, after the slow downward drift in prices for much of the session gained momentum into the close.</p>
<p>Traders said much of today's gain in volatility could be attributed to adjustments after the weekend time decay discount.</p>
<p>A floor trader for a U.S. bank said the quiet schedule of economic reports this week would probably lead volatilities lower again. &quot;I would not be surprised if we slowly grind a bit lower,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>One of the day's largest options transactions occurred late in the session when a Wall Street dealer firm sold 2,000 June 105 puts, floor sources said.</p>
<p>Implied volatilities also rose slightly on Eurodollar options, with September pegged at 10.50 percent late in the session, up 0.3 point from Friday, and December at 12.00 percent, up 0.2 point.</p>
<p>In the short-dated mid-curve options, volatility gained 0.5 point, increasing to 15.70 percent for both June and September. The midcurves expire in 1997 but are priced from 1998 futures.  </p>
