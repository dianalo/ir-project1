<p>A top Chinese envoy in Hong Kong marked the territory's 100-day countdown to Chinese rule on Sunday with a call for unity, urging its residents to rally behind their future government.</p>
<p>Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua news agency branch, or China's de facto mission in Hong Kong, said Beijing placed great trust in the territory's future government, which will be led by tycoon Tung Chee-hwa.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, will revert to China at midnight on June 30, when it will be treated as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) under Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Promised a high degree of self rule under a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula, it will be headed by Tung, who was carefully selected by China in December.</p>
<p>&quot;The central government places great trust in the future Hong Kong SAR government. I think all sectors in Hong Kong should give their full support,&quot; Zhou said in an interview with Cable TV, a local Cantonese-language station.</p>
<p>&quot;As for the mainland, its stable government, economic modernisation, fast burgeoning economy and improvement in society have all given Hong Kong a very positive impact,&quot; Zhou said.</p>
<p>Zhou also said that when he took office seven years ago, many people held the view that Hong Kong would face problems in its transition to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>But with only 100 days to the handover, everyone, including foreigners, thought Hong Kong would remain stable, Zhou said.</p>
<p>More than 7,000 people took to the busy streets of Hong Kong island on Sunday to celebrate the impending reunification with China.</p>
<p>A handful of Hong Kong human right activists disagreed. In a street satire, they voiced fears for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong people will be worried after July 1,&quot; organiser and spokeswoman Miranda Yip said.</p>
<p>&quot;Other pro-China groups may celebrate the handover but meanwhile, we think livelihood issues, all the political issues are the main concerns of Hong Kong people,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's vocal pro-democracy lobby fear China's plans to dilute civil liberties laws and dissolve the elected legislature will mark the first step towards further snuffing out freedoms.</p>
