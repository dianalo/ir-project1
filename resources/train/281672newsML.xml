<title>USA: IMM currency futures close short session higher.</title>
<headline>IMM currency futures close short session higher.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most IMM currency futures finished abbreviated trading -- and the year's final session -- higher.</p>
<p>Currency futures, which closed two hours early Tuesday and will stay shut Wednesday, spent the bulk of the morning ratcheting upward, buffeted by crosses and bolstered by sharp declines in U.S. Treasury bonds and equities.</p>
<p>Losses in T-bond futures, which began the day soft, snowballed after release of U.S. economic data showing far more strength than anticipated.  </p>
<p>November U.S. new single-family home sales jumped 14.2 percent to a 772,000 unit annual rate, well above forecasts for a 731,000 unit rate and the steepest one-month rise since a 16.6 percent gain in April 1993.</p>
<p>T-bond futures also dropped because of a rise in consumer confidence in December to 113.8 from November's revised 109.5.</p>
<p>The Conference Board said the dramatic rise in confidence in 1996 suggested consumer demand will pave the way for a healthy economy during the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>The December Chicago purchasing managers' index slipped to 57.4 from 57.6 in November, against forecasts for 55.6.  </p>
<p>The more robust data reignited concerns that the Federal Reserve early in 1997 will see reason to raise U.S. interest rates to brake economic growth and keep inflation at bay.</p>
<p>March sterling surged to hefty gains and a new contract high at 1.7128, overshooting some technical objectives and leaving it open to a corrective pullback, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling is too rich based on anything I can see here, but it did go to 1992 levels,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;There's legitimate demand for sterling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think if it retraces, it'll go back to 1.70,&quot; said a floor broker. &quot;But I think it's one-way traffic for a while.&quot;  </p>
<p>The analyst also noted that demand for dollars historically tends to emerge and dominate during first few trading days of the new year, thus making it probable that sterling will have chance for a brief correction.</p>
<p>At the end of pit trading, yen firmed $0.000013 to $0.008713, marks rose $0.0070 to $0.6531, Swiss francs rose $0.0055 to $0.7520, sterling rallied $0.0236 to $1.7124, Canadian dollar eased $0.0007 to $0.7332, Australian dollar lost $0.0024 to $0.7936, and the Mexican peso dropped $0.000425 to $0.121350.
