<p>The Treasury said it raised 7.698 trillion lire from the sale of 14 percent of its stake in oil and chemicals group ENI in Italy's largest privatisation to date.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told a news conference institutional investors were allocated 400 million shares. They paid 7,161 lire per share -- the closing price for ENI on Friday on the Milan bourse.</p>
<p>Retail investors were allocated 700 million shares at a price of 6,910 lire per share.  </p>
<p>&quot;This was the biggest retail sale ever carried out on the Italian market and the biggest share offer yet seen in Italy,&quot; said Mario Draghi, the director general of the Treasury.</p>
<p>The overall value of the sale looks set to rise thanks to a reserve of 165 million additional shares which will be offered to institutions, under an over-allotment, or &quot;green shoe&quot;, option, drawn up in the case of heavy demand.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's a good chance all the green shoe will be taken up,&quot; said one of the ENI global organisers, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Ciampi told reporters that if all the green shoe was sold, the Treasury would raise a total 8.88 trillion lire from the second tranche sale. The Treasury placed an initial 15 percent of ENI on the market last November at 5,250 lire per share.  </p>
<p>If all the green show was sold, the Treasury would be left with a 69 percent stake in ENI.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the biggest second tranche placement ever seen in Europe and the largest fully-paid placement in the world,&quot; Ciampi said.</p>
<p>The Treasury decided to increase the size of the offering by 57 percent mid-week because of heavy demand for the stock, especially from retail investors.</p>
<p>Originally Italy planned to sell just 700 million shares, with 250 million of these earmarked for small investors and the rest for institutions.</p>
<p>Draghi said the institutional offering had been oversubscribed by a total three times but did not give details. He said final allocations would be decided between now and Monday morning when the new shares will start trading.</p>
<p>One of the global advisors said he did not think any single institutional investor would finish with more than a one percent stake in ENI. He added that demand from U.S. and British institutions had been especially strong.</p>
<p>Ciampi said proceeds from the sale would go to a special sinking fund set up to reduce Italy's huge debt mountain.</p>
<p>The Treasury said ENI employees, who were offered especially favourable terms, had applied for around 84 million shares. ENI employees as a block now hold more than one percent of the group's stock.</p>
<p>Ciampi said the government would push ahead with plans to sell telecom holding Stet by March 1997, with electricity group Enel following afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hopeful that as the privatisation programme continues...we will reach our objective of one million shareholders (in Italy),&quot; Draghi said.</p>
