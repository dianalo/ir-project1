<p>Amid increasing global concern over the threat of biological warfare, negotiators from 138 countries open talks on Monday to consider boosting an international treaty by adding an inspection regime.</p>
<p>But it will probably take years to adopt verification measures to investigate any violations of the pact, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, according to Western diplomats and U.N. sources.</p>
<p>Under the Cold War pact, the first multilateral disarmament instrument to ban a whole category of weapons, states pledged never to develop, produce or acquire microbial or other biological agents or toxins.</p>
<p>The treaty lacks a built-in inspection regime, although any of the 138 state who have signed it may lodge a complaint against another state with the U.N. Security Council.</p>
<p>The two-week session is the latest in a series of review conferences every five years to assess implementation of the treaty -- whose formal title is Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction.</p>
<p>Western countries, anxious to counter possible use of biological materials by terrorists or rogue states, are pushing for agreement on an inspection regime by 1998, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised powers agreed at a meeting in June that special attention should be paid to the terrorist danger.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a speech to the General Assembly in September, said the pact should within the next two years be given the means to strengthen compliance.</p>
<p>But non-aligned countries do not view the biological weapons issue as a priority and oppose intrusive inspection measures such as those of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, according to Western diplomats.</p>
<p>Western concerns were spelled out in a recent briefing paper by Graham Pearson of the London-based International Security Information Service.</p>
<p>He said proliferation continued, that doubts persisted on whether a secret bio-weapons programme conducted by the old Soviet Union had been dismantled as declared by Russia, and that Iraq's capabilities were still not fully established.</p>
<p>&quot;There is heightened public awareness about disease whether natural, such as the Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire last year or BSE in cattle, or deliberate, such as the terrorist activities of the Japanese Aum sect with its interest in both biological and chemical materials,&quot; the British expert added.</p>
<p>A Western diplomat in Geneva told Reuters the objective was to promote universal adherence to the pact as well as getting &quot;legally binding and effective&quot; inspection.</p>
<p>A U.N. official said verification was not easy, because it touches the medical and pharmaceutical industries, as well as research laboratories. Consensus would be very difficult.</p>
<p>At the last review in 1991, a group of governmental experts was set up to identify potential verification measures from a scientific and technical standpoint.</p>
<p>Their report was submitted to a special conference of signatory states in September 1994, which set up a further group to draft binding proposals for consideration and to draw up lists of bacteriological agents and toxins.</p>
<p>It was also to suggest confidence-building measures to be incorporated and compliance measures &quot;as reliable, cost- effective, non-discriminatory and as non-intrusive as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>The group has agreed to hold three sessions in 1997, but a Western diplomat said the pace was &quot;absolutely insufficient&quot; to reach an agreement in 1998.</p>
