<p>Putting aside such concerns as the United Parcel Service strike, President Bill Clinton plunged into a three-week vacation Monday with a round of golf that showed his game has gotten a bit rusty during his recovery from knee surgery.</p>
<p>Playing under cloudy skies on Martha's Vineyard, a resort island 12 miles off the Massachusetts coast, Clinton stiffly drove his first shot into a sandtrap and followed that with two more drives that were little better than his first.</p>
<p>&quot;Not warmed up. We didn't go to the practice tee,&quot; he groaned to a foursome that included Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan and two officials of the Farm Neck Golf Club, which Clinton often frequented during two previous Martha's Vineyard vacations in 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p>Clinton, who turns 51 on Tuesday, was coming back from a five-month layoff after he tore a tendon in his right knee in March in a stumble at the Florida home of Australian golf pro Greg Norman. He underwent surgery to repair the injury.</p>
<p>A White House spokesman said the president was leaving it to aides to monitor developments in the labor dispute between the UPS delivery firm and its Teamsters' Union workers, which entered its third week Monday.</p>
<p>Before leaving for vacation on Sunday, Clinton urged the parties to redouble their efforts to hammer out an agreement and said he was optimistic that marathon bargaining would succeed.</p>
<p>Some economists say that if the strike is not settled soon, it could begin having a negative impact on the booming U.S. economy, which is one of the factors contributing to Clinton's soaring popularity.</p>
<p>Clinton &quot;is still hopeful that they (the parties) will reach a settlement and he continues to urge the parties to work hard to bridge their remaining differences,&quot; said White House spokesman Barry Toiv.</p>
<p>Toiv said White House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey, the most senior aide with Clinton on Martha's Vineyard, was &quot;in pretty continuous touch&quot; with Labor Secretary Alexis Herman in Washington. She was directing the administration's drive to try to end the UPS strike.</p>
