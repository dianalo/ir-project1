<p>Internal Market Ministers will debate on Thursday what they believe should be included in the Commission's action plan for completing the internal market by 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission will present the plan at the European Council in Amsterdam on June 16-17.</p>
<p>The Internal Market Council held another open debate on the issue at its November 26 meeting, based on the Commission communication on the impact and effectiveness of the internal market, presented in October.</p>
<p>The communication showed the benefits of the single market in the form of higher growth, more jobs and lower inflation but also that much remained to be done, especially in the field of implementing and enforcing single market legislation at the national level.</p>
<p>Thursday's debate will also be open. It is scheduled as the first item after lunch, around 1500 (1400 GMT).</p>
<p>They may also adopt decisions on the maximum speed for tractors and a common position on a directive on harmonising national legislation in respect of dietary foodstuffs.</p>
<p>In addition, Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti will present a report on the follow-up of the first phase of the project on simplifying single market legislation (SLIM).</p>
<p>Ministers will hold talks with their counterparts from eastern and central Europe on questions related to these countries' integration into the internal market. Thursday's talks will deal with standardisation and certification.</p>
<p>Monti will also present the Commission's green paper on public procurement in the EU, adopted by the Commission last November, as well as a report on the follow-up of the Commission's green paper on copyright and related rights in the information society.</p>
