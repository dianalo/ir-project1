<title>CANADA: Investors lift CanOxy, Wascana stocks.</title>
<headline>Investors lift CanOxy, Wascana stocks.</headline>

<p>Investors continued to drive up the share prices of Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd and Wascana Energy Inc on Wednesday in the wake of the companies' C$2-billion merger proposal announcement.</p>
<p>The firms ran first and second among the Toronto Stock Exchange's most active issues late in the session, with target Wascana climbing 0.10 to 20.55 and white knight CanOxy jumping 1.05 to trade at 26.20.  </p>
<p>CanOxy plans to offer C$20.50 a share for Wascana in an all-cash deal that topped a hostile cash and stock bid from Talisman Energy Inc.</p>
<p>Martin Molyneaux, analyst with Calgary-based FirstEnergy Capital Corp, said the new proposal looked favorable for CanOxy based on his estimates of Wascana's asset value.</p>
<p>Wascana's oil and gas reserves were updated and increased by Ryder Scott Co in a report released two weeks ago. Analysts differed on their own interpretations.  </p>
<p>&quot;When I look at it, from rolling in Wascana as I see it -- not necessarily as Wascana has portrayed it -- it makes a lot of financial sense to me,&quot; Molyneaux said. &quot;It's highly additive to cash flow even though in year one and year two it hurts the earnings.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the probability was high that CanOxy would win the the battle for Wascana, but much still depended on Talisman's evaluation of the target's asset value.</p>
<p>Talisman has pushed for access to Wascana's data room to see if it could justify upping its offer of C$18.50 cash or 0.41 of a Talisman share for each Wascana share. Wascana has not said if it was prepared to open the door for Talisman.</p>
<p>Last week, Talisman chief executive Jim Buckee said his firm's calculations placed the net value of Wascana's assets at C$17.50 a share. Wascana has about 81 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>&quot;What really needs to happen is Buckee has got to see the data room, but I think it's a hell of a stretch to think you could add C$400 to C$500 million of value by just getting into the data room,&quot; Molyneaux said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's an 80 percent probability that CanadianOxy gets it.&quot;</p>
