<p>Profitability at Cold Metal Products Inc should improve over the next several quarters as the company's new steel rolling facility increases production and eliminates start-up problems, the company's president and chief executive officer said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're convinced we've built the low cost, high quality facility we set out to build,&quot; James Harpster told Reuters in a phone interview.  </p>
<p>The new $25 million plant in Ottawa, Ohio, was hit by start-up delays last year, which has dampened earnings in recent months.  The facility, originally slated for start-up in October '96, did not begin production until January.</p>
<p>Cold Metal Products earned $0.07 per share in its fiscal first quarter ended June 30 versus earnings of $0.20 per share a year ago.</p>
<p>Harpster, a 49 year-old executive who has been at the company's helm for more than a decade, said problems at the facility have been eliminated and that will boost earnings.  </p>
<p>He said Wall Street estimates for the fiscal second quarter and fiscal '98 were &quot;very conservative.&quot;  The consensus is $0.05 for the quarter and $0.45 for the year. Earnings were $0.14 in last year's quarter and $0.47 in fiscal '97.</p>
<p>Cold Metal Products, based in Youngstown, Ohio, is one of the country's largest steel processors, with nine plants in operation in North America.  The company performs a number of operations including cold-rolling, annealing, and slitting, all of which add value to steel products.  </p>
<p>The company buys steel from steel producers, processes it for customers, and resells it.  It also performs toll processing, meaning it does not take ownership of steel inventory and charges a customer for processing services.</p>
<p>Harpster said the Ottawa facility has been steadily increasing production levels since January and should reach its processing capacity of 100,000 tons annually in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Harpster said Cold Metal Products was in an expansion mode last year, purchasing a steel service center and a processing operation and building the Ottawa facility.  </p>
<p>He said the company this year will turn somewhat inward, focusing on getting a satisfactory return on those investments.</p>
<p>&quot;While acquisitions will be a part of our future, we're building a house on top of these foundations,&quot; he said.  &quot;The focus for this fiscal year will be getting a decent return out of the money we've invested.&quot;</p>
<p>Commenting on the current steel market, Harpster said steel prices have softened slightly, which should help buoy margins at his company.  </p>
<p>&quot;Volume is good and we think it will continue to be over the next few quarters,&quot; he said.  &quot;As far as the steel we buy, there has been a slight decrease in pricing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what's making things go down, is some of this new capacity is starting to come in place,&quot; he said, referring to the spate of new steel minimills either under construction or in production in North America.</p>
<p>While steel producers like to see prices rise, softening prices can be beneficial for steel processors, who have to buy the steel for resale.</p>
<p>&quot;When prices were higher (last year) we were not able to pass all of that through to our customers,&quot; Harpster said. &quot;As a result we saw a squeeze on margins...(softening prices) should help that margin squeeze a little bit.&quot;</p>
