<p>U.S. spot product prices were lower in late morning activity Wednesday tracking action on the NYMEX, after the futures market failed in an upside attempt at reaching new post-Gulf War highs, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was leading the downward move, amid talk barrels were being well offered in U.S. Gulf Coast markets due to the return of one, and possibly two refineries to output.</p>
<p>Gulf Coast cash gasoline values were off by nearly 2.00 cents a gallon, with prompt M3 regular conventional unleaded heard offered at 2.60 cents under November NYMEX unleaded -- about 0.75 cent weaker than as of late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said the return of BP America's catalytic cracker at its Belle Chasse, Louisiana refinery was putting pressure on USG gasoline diffs, as was offers from another Louisiana refinery recently returned from maintenance.</p>
<p>Cash products values in New York Harbor (NYH) were meanwhile steady, though traders said that could change, particularly since this week's data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a draw in East Coast heating oil stocks.</p>
<p>Prompt NYH heating oil was pegged at between 0.25 cent under and the price of November NYMEX heating oil futures.</p>
