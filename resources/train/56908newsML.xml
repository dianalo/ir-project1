<p>Fund managers say Euro-privatisations have a rosy future despite the demise of a big European privatisation fund but will not match the handsome returns enjoyed by British investors in the 1980s.</p>
<p>European fund managers facing a flood of privatisations before the turn of the century are not ready to turn their backs on these issues despite the death of the fund because of poor performance.</p>
<p>They said the future of such privatisations appeared rosier than two years ago but investors in such issues would not see the big profits seen in Britain in the 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some great value out there and more to come,&quot; said Vicky Sleddon, manager of Mercury Asset Management's 719 million pound ($1.12 billion) European Privatisation Trust.</p>
<p>The Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust Plc, which will not exist after November, fell victim to a poorly performing portfolio of shares, many of them French.</p>
<p>Among the investments it made in its two year-life were French car maker Renault, shares in which are now trading 35 percent under their November 1994 issue price.</p>
<p>Barry Verwee, European fund manager at Dutch fund manager AZL, said the problem with France's privatisation programme to date had been the sale of poor-quality companies.</p>
<p>&quot;They weren't very well managed, there was too much government control and they weren't very efficient,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gary Dugan, European equity market strategist for J.P. Morgan Securities in London, said the concept of the European privatisation fund was &quot;still a goer&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the newly-sold companies had suffered in the recent economic downturn in Europe and a high proportion of them were utilities, which typically do not offer above-average returns.</p>
<p>But most European share markets were expected to rise by 15 to 20 percent this year, he said. &quot;In that environment, most of these privatisations should work,&quot; Dugan said.</p>
<p>Britain has blazed the privatisation trail for the world, raising $96.7 billion by selling state assets since 1983.</p>
<p>In a politically-motivated process which defined Margaret Thatcher's reign as prime minister, businesses were sold cheaply and made more attractive with post-privatisation sackings.</p>
<p>But Dugan believed such rich pickings unlikely in Europe, with governments retaining control of privatised companies.</p>
<p>European nations have raised $90 billion from privatisations with another $145 billion planned by 2000, including Deutsche Telekom in November and France Telecom next year.</p>
<p>The $10 billion sale of half of the German giant, Europe's biggest privatisation, is seen as an important test of demand with most fund managers at best cautious about its prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the huge amount of paper in that sector coming to the market, you cannot overprice it,&quot; said one manager.</p>
<p>Massimo Fortuzzi, director of investments at Italy's Finanza &amp; Futuro Fondi, said the Euro-privatisation concept was still valid but these companies had to offer good growth prospects.</p>
<p>Hans-Joerg Frantzmann, a director of German private bank Schroeder Muenchmeyer Hengst, said: &quot;There is no reason to damn the whole idea of Euro-privatisations and say it's all over.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the telecoms sector needed to be closely examined to see if it was still worthwhile, adding that he believed the Deutsche Telekom issue would be a success.</p>
<p>Scottish Widows fund manager Albert Morillo said he would not necessarily invest in privatisations.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the concept is dead, they will carry on the privatisation programmes but it is not a focus of our attention,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dutch-based Robeco, Europe's largest independent fund manager, said it did not offer a Euro-privatisation fund because it saw no future in such a concept.</p>
<p>&quot;It means putting all your eggs in one basket with the risk that there's nothing new you can buy (if privatisations dry up),&quot; said portfolio manager Arjen Jongma. ($1=.6430 Pound)</p>
