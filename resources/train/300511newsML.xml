<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in thin, dull trade this afternoon due to the lack of fresh incentives, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet this afternoon. Most people have already adjusted their positions,&quot; a local dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;There aren't any attractive factors to spur the market. Some people are just standing by now to watch the figures of the U.S. December employment data and hopefully this will stir the market a little,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The figure for the U.S. December employment data is due to be released later on Friday.  </p>
<p>In short dates, weekend eased 2/16 percentage point to 5-1/4 5-1/8 from Thursday's 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent and week-fixed eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-5/16 5-3/16 percent from Thursday's 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent.</p>
<p>Among term rates, one-month eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-7/16 5-5/16 percent from Thursday's 5-1/2 5-3/8 percent, two-months remained at Thursday's 5-1/2 5-3/8 percent. Four-months, five-months and six months remained at Thursday's common 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent. Nine-months remained at Thursday's 5-3/4 5-5/8 percent and twelve-months unchanged at Thursday's 5-7/8 5-3/4 percent. -- M. Ling (65-870-3301)</p>
