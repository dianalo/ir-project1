<p>Boston Scientific Corp. stock rose sharply Tuesday, a day after the maker of medical devices said net sales for the second quarter jumped 25 percent.</p>
<p>The stock climbed $5.875, or more than 9 percent, to $69.125 on Nasdaq shortly after midday. The stock has gradually recovered ground since dropping to as low as $41 in April after the company warned its first-quarter results would not meet analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Boston Scientific said Monday its sales rose to $474 million in the quarter ended June 30 from $379 million in the second quarter of 1996, in line with analyst expectations.</p>
<p>The Natick, Mass.-based company said sales would have increased 28 percent if changes in foreign currency exchange rates had not eroded international revenues.</p>
<p>The company said reported revenues include the combined net sales of Boston Scientific Corp. and former rival Target Therapeutics Inc., whose acquisition it completed during the second quarter.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers analyst Amelia McDonald said Boston Scientific's report gave her &quot;increased confidence&quot; in her second-quarter earnings forecast of 47 cents per share for the company.</p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts on average expect Boston Scientific to report earnings of 44 cents a share in the second quarter, with a range of 40 cents to 47 cents.</p>
<p>The company earned $72.6 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenues of $399.2 million in the first quarter.</p>
<p>A Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst upgraded Boston Scientific's stock to buy from accumulate. The analyst was not available for comment.</p>
<p>Boston Scientific said it expects to release complete second-quarter financial results later this month.</p>
