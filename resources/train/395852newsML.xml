<p>An Israeli court begged to differ this week with a man who claimed spitting before a cross or church was common Jewish practice and should not be viewed as violating laws defending religious worship.</p>
<p>Courts spokesman Moshe Gorali confirmed the details of the case published in Israel's Haaretz daily on Friday.</p>
<p>Haaretz quoted defendant Moshe Arenfeld's lawyer as saying: &quot;Freedom of expression allows a person the freedom to spit...in the presence of religious clergy carrying a cross.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued: &quot;One cannot ignore the common practice in Judaism that a Jew must spit when he passes a church or encounters a cross.&quot;</p>
<p>The defence did the man no good and his appeal against the conviction for spitting on the ground when a procession of priests carrying a cross passed him in Jerusalem was rejected by the court which fined him $250.</p>
<p>The court said Israel's concentration of diverse religious communities in a small area created a sensitive situation where it was necessary to protect religious practices.</p>
