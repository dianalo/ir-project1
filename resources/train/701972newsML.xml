<p>Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, due in New York next week for U.N. sponsored negotiations on the dispute splitting the island, on Wednesday predicted important attempts to resolve the conflict would occur in 1998, but not this year.</p>
<p>Speaking on his return to Cyprus after talks with the Greek government , the Greek Cypriot leader appeared confident that 1998 would be the crucial year in attempts to settle the long-standing dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether a solution will be found or not, that is something we do not know and we did not reach conclusions that with the facts we have before us at this moment we can say there will be a solution,&quot; Clerides told reporters.</p>
<p>Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash are due to meet at a rural retreat called Troutbeck north of New York between July 9 and 13 in the latest UN effort to revive long-stalled negotiations between the two sides.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since Turkish forces seized the north in 1974 in the wake of a brief Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state created in northern Cyprus in 1983 is recognised only by Ankara, which has some 30,000 troops stationed there.</p>
<p>The last time the two leaders met was in October 1994.</p>
