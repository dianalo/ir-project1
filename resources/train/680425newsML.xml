<p>Attorneys for Oklahoma City bombing defendant Terry Nichols have subpoenaed The Dallas Morning News to turn over a purported confession by convicted co-defendant Timothy McVeigh, according to court documents made public on Monday.</p>
<p>The action surfaced after the newspaper, which created an uproar when it reported the &quot;confession&quot; on the Internet in February, asked the bombing case judge to quash the subpoena.</p>
<p>Nichols is expected to go on trial this year for the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, which claimed 168 lives. McVeigh was sentenced to death this month for the bombing, the worst mass murder in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Nichols' lawyers want the Dallas newspaper to turn over what it said were &quot;statements attributed to McVeigh in several 1995 summaries by a member of McVeigh's defence team.&quot; Stephen Jones, McVeigh's chief lawyer, accused the newspaper in March of stealing the documents from a computer, a charge it denied.</p>
<p>Jones said the documents did not amount to a confession but were a defence ploy to entice an uncooperative witness to talk to McVeigh's defence team.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Nichols' lawyers should seek the documents from McVeigh's lawyers, not from the newspaper. It said the subpoena would interfere with its use of confidential sources, one of whom supplied the documents.</p>
<p>Freelance writer Ben Fenwick, who wrote a Playboy article about McVeigh's alleged movements on the day of the bombing, is seeking to quash a similiar subpoena from Nichols' lawyers.</p>
<p>Separately, Nichols' lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch to give them immediate access to transcripts of sealed court proceedings from McVeigh's trial. In a filing made public Monday, they said they believed &quot;a number of important legal determinations were made during in-chambers or bench conferences&quot; at McVeigh's jury selection and trial.</p>
<p>Nichols' lawyers said they need the information to prepare for his trial, claiming it would be unfair to allow only prosecutors to have it. The transcripts may include information about &quot;other possible perpetrators&quot; of the bombing and admissibility of evidence, the lawyers said.</p>
