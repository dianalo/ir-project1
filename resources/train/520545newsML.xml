<p>Hopes for the first direct Taiwan strait crossings since 1949 were mixed with scepticism and tinged with caution on Friday as no ships were known to have set sail despite the apparent removal of all obstacles.</p>
<p>Taipei on April 11 gave a green light to an initial batch of mainland shippers to cross the heavily militarised ideological divide and Beijing reciprocated on Thursday with unprecedented approvals for six Taiwan carriers.</p>
<p>Approved firms on both sides had container ships ready to weigh anchor, yet none was known to have actually set sail as of late on Friday.</p>
<p>Local media had said China's Sheng Da planned to sail as early as Thursday, but officials at Taiwan's southern port of Kaohsiung said they had yet to receive the notice of arrival that must be received 24 hours before a ship enters port.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Yangming Marine Transport Corp, approved by China on Thursday, said it was still booking freight.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still preparing. It won't be today or tomorrow, but maybe next week,&quot; a Yangming official said. &quot;We need to put together cargoes. There is no point to send an empty ship across the strait.&quot;</p>
<p>Uniglory Marine Corp said it would not send its ship, the Uni Order, to China's port of Xiamen until April 25.</p>
<p>Taiwan vice-minister of transport Mao Chih-kuo said the situation would remain uncertain until vessels from either side actually approached the other's shore.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's not hurry,&quot; Mao told state television. &quot;Let's take one step at a time. We haven't even taken the first step yet.&quot;</p>
<p>An official of the cabinet's policymaking Mainland Affairs Council voiced impatience and hinted Taiwan hoped to see the first crossing from China as a sign of goodwill.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle we welcome the other side's approval, but we hope to see the crossings start as soon as possible,&quot; the United Daily News quoted the official as saying without giving his name. &quot;After all, we have waited long enough.&quot;</p>
<p>Direct links would ease a ban enforced by Taiwan's Republic of China government since it lost a civil war to the communists in 1949 and took refuge on the island.</p>
<p>Taipei feels that Beijing has been stalling in the two years since Taiwan proposed the evolving &quot;offshore trans-shipment centre&quot; plan.</p>
<p>The scheme forbids direct cargo exchanges so as to uphold its ban on direct links, allowing mainland cargoes only to be handled at Kaohsiung's &quot;offshore&quot; centre for onward transfer but not brought into Taiwan customs.</p>
<p>In the same manner, Taiwan cargoes at Kaohsiung cannot be loaded on board ships for direct passage to the mainland.</p>
<p>Beijing sees Taiwan as rebel-held province that eventually must be brought under its sovereignty, by force if necessary, creating anxiety on the island about mainland ties.</p>
<p>Taiwan has said warmer Taipei-Beijing relations were needed before direct shipping, aviation and other links could begin and has urged Taiwan firms to slow their huge investments in China, already valued at some US$30 billion.</p>
<p>Taiwan's 30,000 firms with mainland investments have urged Taipei to ease its ban, saying direct links would pare the extra costs of routing business &quot;indirectly&quot; via Hong Kong.</p>
<p>President Lee Teng-hui indicated on Thursday that a warming was not imminent, saying serious bilateral dialogue was unlikely before a meeting of Beijing's Communist Party in October.</p>
<p>Asked about prospects for ports other than Kaohsiung to offer China shipping links, top economic policy maker Chiang Pin-kung told reporters Taiwan would expand the scheme slowly.</p>
<p>The first step, the chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development said, would be to allow processing of mainland cargoes at Kaohsiung's offshore bonded zone, but goods would still have to be trans-shipped to other destinations.</p>
