<title>SINGAPORE: Singapore protests Australia TV show on Burma drug link.</title>
<headline>Singapore protests Australia TV show on Burma drug link.</headline>

<p>Singapore has filed a protest with Australia's Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) over allegations of a link between investments by the city-state and a Burmese drug lord, Singapore media reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Both state television and the Straits Times newspaper said it was understood the Singapore High Commission in Canberra had filed the protest earlier in the week. They gave no details of the contents.</p>
<p>Government officials were not immediately available on Friday for comment on the reports.</p>
<p>The TV show Dateline aired the programme on Australia's Special Broadcasting Service last month.</p>
<p>Singapore opposition politicians Chee Soon-Juan and Jafar Ahmad said in a statement on Thursday that the programme alleged Singapore Government Investment Corporation funds were invested in Burma in projects linked to a Burmese drug lord.</p>
<p>&quot;If the entire programme is untrue, then the Australian TV station has cast a terrible slur on Singapore's integrity and the scandalous and scurrilous aspersions cast must be refuted rigorously,&quot; the two politicians said.</p>
<p>The executive producer of the programme, Adrian Herring, told Reuters in Australia on Friday: &quot;We stand by our story 100 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Chee also wanted to know if the Burmese, whom the Australian Federal police reportedly described as a major drug trafficker, was allowed to move freely in or out of Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore has tough anti-drug laws, including a mandatory death sentence for anyone over 18 years found guilty of traficking in more than 15 grams (half an ounce) of heroin, 30 grams (an ounce) of morphine or 500 grams (18 oz) of cannabis.</p>
<p>One Singaporean was hanged on Friday for drug trafficking, the prisons department said. More than half of the 280 people hanged for various offences in the city-state since the mid-70s were found guilty of drug charges.</p>
