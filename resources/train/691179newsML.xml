<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks seen easing on finance sector woes.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks seen easing on finance sector woes.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks are seen edging down on Thursday hampered by continued market concerns surrounding the finance sector and doubts surrounding the future of Finance One Plc, analysts said.</p>
<p>The SET Index rose 2.90 points to 496.03 on Wednesday. The SET 50 rose 0.37 points to 35.27.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the Fin One situation will continue to weigh on the market as sales of financial sector shares may drag the market down,&quot; said one senior foreign analyst.  </p>
<p>The subscription book to a planned rights issue by ailing Finance One Plc, once the country's most successful finance firm, closed on Wednesday with doubt surrounding the subscription.</p>
<p>The low weighting of the finance sector in the market as a whole may pare losses and there is continuing foreign interest in telecoms, energy and banking stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is a case for saying that apart from technical reasons for exposure to this market, the risk of being underweight ahead of a possible ultra-rapid bounce are there,&quot; he said.--James Mclean (662) 652-0642</p>
