<p>W.R. Grace &amp; Co Tuesday said it sees higher profits and cash flow in 1997 as operating margins approach the goals established in March 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Our operating margins from continuing operations for 1996 were 12 percent of sales, just shy of our goal to improve three percentage points over operating margins of 9.5 percent in 1995,&quot; said chief executive Albert J. Costello.</p>
<p>This resulted in earnings from operations, excluding charges and gains on asset sales, of $2.41 per share for the year, including $0.82 in the fourth quarter -- up 22 percent for the quarter and 13 percent for the year over 1995.  </p>
<p>As recently as December, the company projected the fourth quarter total would be $0.75 to $0.79 per share.</p>
<p>At that time, it also projected operating margins of around 14 percent of sales in 1997.</p>
<p>This is why the company expects to deliver higher profits and cash flow in 1997, chief financial officer Larry Ellberger told Reuters.</p>
<p>Noting Grace was cash positive in 1996, he said it will have cash flow of &quot;$100 million, maybe $150 million&quot; in 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;We remain confident that we will achieve our goals of attaining 15 percent operating margins (earnings before interest and taxes) and free operating cash flow of $200 million by the end of 1998,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>Ellberger went further, saying cash flow would be &quot;above $200 million.&quot;</p>
<p>Ellberger said capital spending of less than $300 million is expected this year, down from $450 million 1996 and $485 million in 1995 when Grace was investing in packaging and catalyst projects.</p>
<p>During 1996, Grace divested non-core businesses, &quot;including the tax-free National Medical Care transaction valued at $4.5 billion.  With proceeds from this transaction, as well as from the sales of Dearborn, Amicon and Agracetus, we significantly reduced debt and have returned cash to our shareholders by repurchasing more than 24 million Grace shares,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, we completed our program to reduce annual costs by $100 million, and we instituted more rigorous financial and working capital controls.&quot;</p>
