<p>Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko has named a new economy minister, cheering analysts who welcomed the move as a step in the right direction in the credit-starved former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>Lukashenko's press office said on Wednesday that Vladimir Shimov, who had been a deputy economy minister since August 1995, would fill the post following a decree signed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts based in the capital of the republic sandwiched between Russia and Poland welcomed Shimov's promotion. &quot;I personally am very optimistic about the appointment,&quot; one Minsk-based economist told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Shimov is reputed to be a very highly qualified professional and more market-oriented and aware of market needs than some,&quot; said a Western analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Lukashenko has taken a go-slow approach to reforming his republic of 10 million after years of Soviet stagnation, freezing privatisation and keeping a tight rein on banks and on the national rouble currency.</p>
<p>The World Bank halted credit in May, pending faster reforms. In March, the International Monetary Fund froze most of a $300 million standby credit agreed last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Shimov's appointment will certainly not do any harm, but it remains to be seen how forceful he can be in pushing any reforms through,&quot; the Western analyst said.</p>
<p>Shimov's predecessor, Georgy Badei, quit in July after being accused at a Security Council meeting of ruining the economy.</p>
<p>An official close to him said Lukashenko's administration had &quot;repeatedly ignored the minister's proposals intended to speed up reforms&quot;.</p>
<p>The economist said Shimov had worked in close contact with the World Bank on an economic programme to 2000 which Lukashenko rejected and replaced with his own version.</p>
<p>&quot;The programme worked on by the economic ministry, including Shimov, with the World Bank is notable for its market orientation,&quot; the economist said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately that programme did not become the basis of the president's one, though thanks to Shimov many proposals which had astonished Western experts were removed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Shimov had succeeded in particular in removing plans to impose tight controls on prices and on monetary policy and to increase emissions significantly, he added.</p>
<p>Shimov was deputy head of an academic economic institute in Minsk before joining the ministry last year.</p>
<p>Of Bulgarian parentage, he is a doctor of economic sciences and until 1976 he worked at &quot;Gosplan&quot;, a committee which drew up plans for the economy before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p>
