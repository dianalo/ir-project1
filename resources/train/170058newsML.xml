<p>Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel NV Wednesday announced fractionally higher third-quarter profits but said it was targeting increased profitability through continued expansion of its most profitable activities.</p>
<p>Earnings came in at 328 million guilders ($193.4 million) versus 324 million guilders ($191 million) a year earlier, with operating profits at 510 million guilders ($301 million) versus 494 million guilders ($291 million).</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first quarter of this year in which not only sales but also operating income and net earnings improved,&quot; outgoing finance director Syb Bergsma told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We therefore maintain our earlier view that for the full year net income excluding extraordinary items will be of the same order of magnitude as in 1995,&quot; he said, adding the group did not expect to post any one-time gains or losses in 1996.</p>
<p>Bergsma said a 40 percent jump in operating earnings at the group's coatings division had been almost wiped out by lower contributions from fibres and chemicals.</p>
<p>Akzo will continue to shift the emphasis of its activities toward high-margin pharmaceuticals and coatings in the future, in a drive to achieve its profitability target of a 20 percent return on investment, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>Coatings and pharmaceuticals generated about two-thirds of operating profits in the first nine months of this year and a hefty 80 percent in the third quarter, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>He said return on investment for the group as a whole currently amounted to around 16 percent.</p>
<p>Bergsma said that in coatings, the synergy effects of the 1994 merger between Akzo and Sweden's Nobel were paying off. Chemicals were hit by lower bulk selling prices although speciality chemicals turned in improved results, he said.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical earnings were braked by the aftermath of the contraceptive pill scare which broke in October last year, hurting sales in Britain and Germany. Start-up costs for two new drugs with high earnings potential had also depressed pharmaceuticals profits, Bergsma said.</p>
<p>Remeron, an anti-depressant Akzo claims has performed better in trials than Eli Lilly's Prozac, is expected to unlock a huge market, as is fertility drug Puregon.</p>
<p>&quot;The results were slightly below our estimates,&quot; said Andreas de Groot, analyst with MeesPierson. &quot;What disappointed was the chemicals activities ... but coatings was far more positive.&quot;</p>
