<p>The Ronald H. Brown Foundation, founded in honour of the energetic U.S. commerce secretary killed last year in a Croatia (corrects from Bosnia) plane crash, came to his hometown to kick off a national fund-raising campaign.</p>
<p>The hosts of a New York reception Monday told a blue-ribbon crowd that the 9-month-old foundation would also be raising funds in Washington and Atlanta.</p>
<p>From a relatively privileged childhood in predominantly black Harlem, Ron Brown became the only black person so far to chair a major political party and was credited with a major role in Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential victory.</p>
<p>Brown then energised the Department of Commerce by working hard to maximize American exports.</p>
<p>The social goals of the Brown foundation's three divisions were designed to reflect his father's values and achievements, foundation president Michael Brown said.</p>
<p>Business people unfamiliar with different cultures will be able to learn diplomacy and the behaviour recommended for nations of their choice at a Centre for Politics and Commercial Diplomacy, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans are sometimes considered rude when they try to do business in other countries,&quot; he told a laughing audience.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan centre will also teach practical political skills for domestic use, drawing on the experience of mayors, congressmen and other elected officials, he said.</p>
<p>The Ronald H. Brown Global Clearinghouse, which first convened last November, will show proprietors of small and medium-sized businesses, especially women and members of minorities, how to overcome hurdles that have prevented them from doing business overseas, Brown said.</p>
<p>That activity will follow his father's policy of &quot;getting people to the table who traditionally did not have a seat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Finally, a think tank will be inaugurated next year to help business owners from historically disadvantaged groups develop &quot;national and international policy agendas,&quot; Brown said.</p>
