<title>USA: SEC charges six in Royce insider case.</title>
<headline>SEC charges six in Royce insider case.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday it charged three executives of Royce Laboratories Inc., and three others with insider trading using nonpublic information concerning the company's generic drug, Piroxicam.</p>
<p>In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., the SEC alleged the defendants conducted two rounds of insider trading of the Miami-based pharmaceutical company's stock in the fall of 1991 and spring of 1992, resulting in illegal profits and losses avoided of more than $142,638.</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that Abul Bhuiyan, 43, executive vice president; Nilkanth Patel, 41, quality control director; and Hasmukh Patel, 47, chemist; bought Royce securities in September 1991 with knowledge that the company was about to or had received tentative approval from regulators to market Piroxicam. All three are Florida residents.</p>
<p>Nilkanth Patel allegedly tipped off his friends Janak C. Patel, of Elmhurst, Ill., and Janak M. Patel, of Wood Dale, Ill., while Janak C. Patel revealed the confidential information to a brother-in-law, Kanubhai Patel, of Flushing, N.Y., the SEC said. Separately, Hasmukh Patel also tipped off an unidentified relative, the SEC said.</p>
<p>The SEC alleged the men who had been tipped off then bought Royce securities before the Sept. 11 announcement of the Food and Drug Administration's tentative approval of Piroxicam. Generic drugs are cheaper versions of brand-name drugs that have lost their patents.</p>
<p>The SEC said that months later, Nilkanth Patel told Hasmukh Patel about the FDA's decision to deny final approval of Piroxicam. Nilkanth Patel also tipped Janak C. Patel, who then relayed the same information to Janak M. Patel and Kanubhai Patel. Each then sold Royce stock before the company announced the FDA decision on April 22, 1991.</p>
<p>The SEC said it is seeking permanent injunctions, the return of all alleged illegal profits, plus prejudgment interest and illegal insider trading penalties against the defendants.</p>
<p>Helen Williams, an aide to Royce President Patrick McEnany, said McEnany had not seen the complaint and would not comment. She said the company was expected to issue a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>William Nortman, a lawyer representing the three Royce executives, said his clients denied any violation. He said the transactions alleged by the SEC &quot;were done in an innocent fashion,&quot; adding his clients are exploring their options in trying to resolve matters with the SEC.</p>
<p>J. Michael Fitzsimmons, a lawyer for Janek C. and Janek M. Patel, said he was in discussion with the SEC staff regarding the allegations.</p>
<p>Laywer John Doyle, who represents Kanubhai Patel, was not available to comment.</p>
<p>In May, Royce and McEnany settled a separate SEC civil lawsuit charging them with issuing a misleading press release about the status of the government's approval of Piroxicam. They settled without admitting or denying guilt.</p>
