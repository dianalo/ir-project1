<p>India's Kharif or winter oilseed crop in the 1996/97 (November-October) season is expected to be 11.91 million tonnes, marginally up from the previous year's 11.43 million, a top trade body said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Central Organisation for Oils Industry and Trade (COOIT) said, at a national convention on oilseeds in the southern city of Bangalore, that the soybean crop however would be lower at 4.06 million tonnes in 1996/97 against 4.45 million in the earlier year.  </p>
<p>The COOIT estimated groundnut crop during the same period at 5.7 million tonnes against 4.95 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;The highlight of the oilseeds crop this year has been groundnut,&quot; said S.T. Parikh, COOIT convener for crop estimates.</p>
<p>He said the western state of Gujarat accounted for most of the rise with 1.7 million tonnes in the current season against 1.0 million in the previous season.</p>
<p>India's oilseeds production comprises Kharif or winter crop and Rabi or summer harvest.</p>
<p>Delegates to the COOIT convention estimated overall crop in the current year would be around 21.90 million tonnes against 20.98 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>They said the 1996/97 monsoon which helped the Kharif crop would also be helpful to the Rabi harvest which would be sown early next year and harvested in April-May.</p>
<p>&quot;Our estimates of Rabi will be around 10 million against 9.55 million in the previous year,&quot; said a top COOIT official.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who inaugurated the convention, promised to look into the COOIT demand for allowing free imports of oilseeds.</p>
<p>He said the government would consider allowing free import of oilseeds provided the farmers were protected and consumers benefited from the move.</p>
<p>Gowda said the government would also consider removing controls on storage of oilseeds and revamping of tax structure.</p>
<p>He said the acreage under India's oilseeds crop rose to 26 million hectares from 19 million in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The oilseeds productivity per hectare had also gone up to 800 kg from 500 kg. &quot;But this is not sufficient to meet the growing demand for oils,&quot; he told the convention.</p>
