<p>Shares in sports goods group Amer-yhtyma Oy fell on Tuesday from last week's peaks after the owner of Wilson and MacGregor golf and tennis equipment warned it would make a clear loss in full-year 1996.</p>
<p>Amer said in a statement it would &quot;remain clearly loss-making&quot; at the pre-tax and extras level, which in 1995 showed a 142 million markka ($31.77 million) profit.</p>
<p>It had earlier said it would be loss-making this year, but not used the qualifier &quot;clearly&quot;.</p>
<p>The statement said problems at Amer's Wilson and MacGregor golf operations continue to have a negative impact on the group's results.</p>
<p>Amer's stock, which had risen by some 69 percent in heavy volumes since June to a peak of 120.00 on August 21, fell at one point by five percent but later trimmed losses as brokers reported some foreign demand for the stock.</p>
<p>Amer president Roger Talermo, a former Finnish downhill skiing champion in office since May with a pledge to restructure the company with a focus on sports, said he could &quot;only speculate&quot; about the recent sustained stock gains.</p>
<p>&quot;I think -- and you must allow me to be wrong -- that our clear-cut announcements on the sporting goods focus and a plan to clear up a loss-making unit has probably triggered very positive feedback by institutional investors,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said by telephone that investors with a longer-term view -- looking five to 10 years ahead -- may be buying Amer on recovery hopes while those with a one-year scope were sellers on prospects of a near-term loss.</p>
<p>&quot;I honestly think that's what happened,&quot; he said. &quot;The long term expectations versus the short-term have caused the volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>This also explained the weight of volume in recent trades -- bigger investors would usually move in bigger quantities.</p>
<p>But he said he had not had any direct contact with funds or institutional investors that would underpin this view. &quot;I don't have a clue in that respect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked how he viewed the possibility that the buying may be driven by efforts to trigger a takeover, he said it was &quot;a likelihood theoretically&quot;.</p>
<p>But he said he understood the Finnish institutional holders of Amer's vote-controlling K-shares, who held talks earlier this year about possibly selling their holdings, were not now in a hurry to sell.</p>
<p>&quot;I read (that) some of them said, 'let's wait and see,'&quot; he said.</p>
