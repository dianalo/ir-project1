<p>Hoffmann-La Roche said Thursday that early data showed its Invirase (saquinavir) AIDS drug interacted favorably with Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc's Viracept (nelfinavir).</p>
<p>The preliminary results from 12-week trials, which were presented at a conference here, found that Viracept increased Invirase exposures five-fold and that the combination was generally well tolerated.</p>
<p>Both treatments are protease inhibitors. Invirase has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, while Viracept is currently before the agency.  </p>
<p>&quot;These results demonstrate that Invirase in combination with Viracept holds great promise as a future therapeutic option,&quot; said Steven Kravcik of Ottawa General Hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Preliminary data from this 12-week trial and available resistance data on both of these compounds support evaluation of anti-HIV activity of Invirase and Viracept in a large clinical trial,&quot; said Kravcik, who headed the study.</p>
<p>A total of 14 patients with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, were given either Invirase or Viracept on the day before and on the last day of a four-day treatment of the other drug.</p>
<p>Treatments were reversed after a washout period.  </p>
<p>None of the subjects had been treated with a protease inhibitor before.</p>
<p>&quot;Results showed Viracept increased Invirase plasma concentrations five-fold,&quot; Hoffman-La Roche said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two drugs were then given simultaneously. After 12 weeks, the combination had reduced viral load by 2.05 logs and increased CD4 counts by a median of 117.5 cells/ml.</p>
<p>Under an agreement announced this week, Roche has exclusive marketing rights for Viracept in Europe and other countries, while Agouron retains the rights in North America and co-developer Japan Tobacco retains the rights in Asia.</p>
<p>In addition to Viracept, Invirase is being studied in combination with two other protease inhibitors, Merck and Co Inc's Crixivan (indinavir) and Abbott Laboratories Inc's Norvir (ritonavir).</p>
<p>A single-dose study in 18 volunteers showed that Invirase can be enhanced fivefold to eightfold with Crixivan, Hoffman-La Roche said.</p>
<p>Invirase and Norvir together reduced viral load by 99.9 percent at 24 weeks, the company added.</p>
