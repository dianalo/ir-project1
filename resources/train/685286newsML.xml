<p>After months of bloodshed, southern Albania wants President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party voted out in Sunday's general election.</p>
<p>And no one is willing to contemplate what might happen if it holds off a determined challenge from the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>A small crowd around Socialist candidate Gramos Ruci in this nearly-deserted coastal town showed little interest in his pledges to right the economy. But the mention of Berisha's name set passions alight.</p>
<p>&quot;Down with Berisha, Down with Berisha!&quot; the gathering shouted, interrupting Ruci. On rooftops overlooking the square, young men keep watch on the rally, machine guns at the ready.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the Socialist party will win,&quot; Ruci told Reuters. &quot;But if Berisha's party wins, the country will not accept this and the Albanian tragedy will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been killed since March in the upheaval triggered by the collapse of fraudulent pyramid investment schemes that left hundreds of thousands destitute. Most blamed Berisha for their losses.</p>
<p>With thousands of weapons looted from army depots, the country was plunged into anarchy. A multinational force was dispatched to keep order for Sunday's snap election, seen as the last hope for peace.</p>
<p>Berisha's Democrats will win few votes in the south. Their candidates say they have been prevented from campaigning there.</p>
<p>Observers have doubts whether the south will accept any result that secures Berisha's hold on power. The Democrats won most of the seats in parliament in last year's election dismissed as flawed by many observers.</p>
<p>&quot;I worked for five years in Greece and lost all my money in the pyramids. Berisha must finish,&quot; said taxi driver Agim Balili, a Kalashnikov placed prominently in the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Reformed successors to Enver Hoxha's hardline communists who isolated Albania from the world for 45 years, the Socialists under economist Fatos Nano promise to track down and return the lost money.</p>
<p>Residents of this palm tree-lined town say voters will back the Socialists even if they do not believe their promises.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody believes Nano will return the money but people will vote for him just to get rid of Berisha,&quot; said Konstantina Beziani, a candidate for the Union of Human Rights party which represents the large Greek minority in the south.</p>
<p>&quot;In the south nobody will believe a result that gives victory to Berisha. If he wins, we will have full-scale civil war.&quot;</p>
<p>Beziani said the dwindling size of the voters' roll posed a threat to the election in addition to violence and confusion over voting procedures.</p>
<p>Since the pyramid schemes collapsed, people have begun leaving again in even greater numbers to work in Greece to support their families. Others have sent womenfolk and children abroad to escape the violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarande had 23,000 voters last year. Now only 6,700 have registered to vote,&quot; she said. &quot;Unless people return in time to register to vote, there is no hope.&quot;</p>
<p>But few are expected to return to the constant thunder of guns, the threat of roadside robbery and lack of material comforts to vote in an election which may produce an outcome they simply do not trust.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an election under the pressure of Kalashnikovs,&quot; said Haralambos Athanasiu, president of the local committee of Omonia, an ethnic Greek minority group.</p>
<p>&quot;The multi-national force is non-existent in the south. We are abandoned.&quot;</p>
