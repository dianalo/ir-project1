<title>USA: CME live and feeder cattle seen steady to lower.</title>
<headline>CME live and feeder cattle seen steady to lower.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME live cattle futures were expected to open steady to 0.150 cent lower while feeder cattle futures were called steady to 0.100 cent lower, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Further pressure was expected in nearby live cattle futures following the weak tone to both boxed beef and live markets. Deferred contracts may show support from expectations of a bullish cattle inventory report, analysts said.</p>
<p>Heavy weight choice boxed beef declined to $96.49 per cwt, the lowest price level since May 6, and fed cattle at $64 per cwt were down to the lowest price level since early August.  </p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures may show spillover pressure from live cattle with higher corn futures indications also expected to weigh on prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>However, underlying support will likely continue from bullish projections on Friday's semi-annual inventory report and even tighter supplies due to recent heavy death loss due to snowstorms and bitter cold, they said.</p>
<p>Analyst projections on the inventory report averaged 98.1 percent of last year, or 101.83 million head, for total U.S. cattle numbers on January 1. Actual numbers ranged from 100.9 to 103.8 million head, 97 to 100.2 percent of last year.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $0.22 at $69.55 per cwt.</p>
