<p>Norwegian shipbuilding and offshore engineering group Kvaerner ASA said on Friday it had won a contract worth about 200 million crowns for its Kleven Ulsteinvik shipyard for a specialist offshore supply ship.</p>
<p>In a statement Kvaerner said the order for the large multipurpose platform supply vessel, slightly different to the type of craft usually built at the yard, would be for domestic customer  Eidesvik &amp; Co A/S.</p>
<p>The size and complexity of the order, for a vessel set to be the largest of its kind in the world, would provide a full workload for the Ulsteinvik yard for all of this year and part of next, the parent company said in a statement issued in both London and Oslo. The ship is due for delivery next March.</p>
<p>&quot;This contract is fresh evidence that we can continuously adapt to the market and to customer needs,&quot; yard head Sigurd Viseth was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Kvaerner acquired the twin Kleven yards of Ulsteinvik and Leirvik, both near the western town of Aalesund, from their founding family several years ago but has struggled to make money from them recently.</p>
<p>Ulsteinvik has primarily specialised in smaller craft, including fishing boats, and provided design work for the bigger merchant ships which have been built at nearby Leirvik.</p>
