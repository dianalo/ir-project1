<p>A former German cabinet minister who heads an institute which speaks out on human rights said on Wednesday Burma had refused him an entry visa.</p>
<p>Otto Lambsdorff, a former economics minister and leading member of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), had planned to hold talks with both the Burmese leadership and democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes clear that the Burmese military regime is not interested in political dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi,&quot; said Lambsdorff, chairman of the Friedrich Naumann Institute, which is closely linked to the FDP.</p>
<p>The institute said the Burmese embassy had declined Lambsdorff's application for a visa because it considered his visit to be &quot;inappropriate for political reasons&quot;.</p>
<p>Lambsdorff sent an open letter to Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, calling on him to press for the European Union to adopt a clear line on Burma.</p>
<p>In particular, he said a meeting of EU ministers later this month should strip the southeast Asian nation of preferential trade status as a punishment for massive use of slave labour in Burma.</p>
<p>&quot;The German government has spoken out clearly against slave labour,&quot; Lambsdorff said. &quot;It should therefore commit itself to abolishing the preferential customs treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year the Naumann Foundation annoyed China by inviting Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to speak at a conference partly financed with government money.</p>
