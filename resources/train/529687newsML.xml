<p>Music and entertainment group PolyGram NV said on Tuesday its earlier announced 1.6 percent dip in first quarter net profit reflected differing fortunes in its music and filmed entertainment units.</p>
<p>First quarter group net profit slipped to 122 million guilders from 124 million in the first quarter of 1996, with first quarter 1997 operating losses from the film unit increasing to 55 million guilders from 19 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Music activities improved during the quarter, whereas film was weak, primarily due to the underperformance of two new releases,&quot; PolyGram said in a statement with the results.</p>
<p>Operating profit at the group, reporting quarterly for the first time, edged up to 196 million guilders from 192 million, with operating profit from the music division climbing to 251 million guilders from a previous 211 million.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a big improvement in music's operating margins,&quot; said a PolyGram spokeswoman, noting they had increased to 13.1 percent in the first quarter of 1997 from 12.1 percent in the same quarter a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales at the music unit continued to dwarf those at the film division, rising to 1.91 billion guilders from 1.75 billion. Film's sales rose to 293 million from 287 million guilders.    </p>
<p>PolyGram said the films &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; and &quot;Gridlock'd&quot; had underperformed, having a financial impact on the quarter, although the 1996 release &quot;Sleepers&quot; was still scoring international success.</p>
<p>&quot;We are comforted by the fact that we continue to see the quality of our film product improve and our overall slate developing as planned,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that film was weak because the film release schedule is weighted to the second half of the year and said that it foresaw &quot;satisfactory&quot; full year results from the film division.</p>
<p>The film unit had a 1996 full year operating loss of 35 million guilders, after breaking even in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Chief executive Alain Levy said in February that PolyGram was not expecting to see a profit from the film division this year. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
