<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger in thin trade on Friday, pulled higher by gains in U.S. Treasuries, but underperforming the U.S. market amid weakness in the Canadian dollar, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still being weighed on a little bit by this weakness in the currency. I think that's caused some level of underperformance,&quot; said Jim Webber, director of fixed income research with TD Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.56 to C$116.18 to yield 6.688 percent against the U.S. 30-year bonds, which rose 31/32 to yield 6.36 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the benchmark bonds widened to 33 basis points from 29 basis points at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar weakened sharply on Friday, closing at C$1.3513 (US$0.7401) from Thursday's close at C$1.3463 (US$0.7428) after disappointing third-quarter current account numbers.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada this morning reported the country's current account surplus came in at a lower than expected C$551 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The weakness in the dollar and the disappointing report led Canadian bonds to underperform, Webber said.  </p>
<p>Dealings were thin in the Canadian market after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent of 2006 rose C$0.51 to C$107.40 to yield 6.004 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond rose 18/32 to yield 6.05 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the two narrowed to five basis points from six basis points at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month cash bill traded at 2.74 percent against the U.S. bill at 5.13 percent.</p>
