<p>Opener Martin Faull scored an unbeaten half-century as South Australia took charge of their Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania on Thursday.</p>

<p>Faull steadied the innings by adding 103 runs in an unbroken partnership with Geoff Parker, who remained on 39 not out.</p>
<p>Pace bowler Colin Miller briefly raised Tasmania's hopes by taking three quick wickets to reduce South Australia to 24 for three after 10 overs.</p>
<p>Discarded Australia test batsman Ricky Ponting earlier scored 126, more than half his side's total, as Tasmania made 248 in reply to South Australia's first innings 387.</p>
<p>South Australia all-rounder Joe Scuderi claimed five for 43 to add to his valuable 70 runs in the first innings.</p>
<p>His efforts helped South Australia, who prop up the Shield table, take the two competition points on offer for a first innings lead.</p>
<p>Tasmania must beat South Australia to move into second place in the standings behind Western Australia.</p>
