<headline>LIFFE white sugar retains gains, supply fears cited.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-30</dateline>

<p>White sugar futures managed to hold onto most of their earlier trade-fuelled buying gains on Friday despite a bout of profit-taking at the highs, traders said.</p>
<p>Concern over seasonal tightness has prompted trade players to buy into the spot month amid market fears of reduced supply between the tail-end of the European crop and the start of the 1997/98 campaign.</p>
<p>Little interest was reported in the August/July arbitrage, whose nominal value is gradually widening as the whites edge higher.</p>
<p>But with July raws expected to ease as funds move out of the position and Brazilians price sugars from around 11.30 cents/lb, the differential should widen further from its current level of $76.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if you bought the premium at this high level, I think you'd still make money on it because I don't think the whites will come down,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got to be long of the spread and be long of the whites in general because it's going to be steady for the next couple of months.&quot;</p>
<p>At 1550 GMT August was up 20 cents at $324.10 and October up 50 cents at $314.10. Volume was 1,736 lots, most of which was in the spot month.</p>
<p>Paris volume was subdued at just 284 lots. August was up 60 cents at $324.00 and October up $2.40 at $314.90.</p>
