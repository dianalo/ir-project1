<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends up sharply, September jumps 5 pct.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends up sharply, September jumps 5 pct.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures rose sharply on Monday, bolstered by keen local and speculative buying amid persistent concerns about a near-term shortage of quality supply, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The one thing that is driving this market is anxiety about there being enough coffee for September delivery,&quot; said Refco Inc analyst Ann Prendergast.</p>
<p>Benchmark September arabicas surged to a session high of 196.75 cents per lb before a late-session bout of profit-taking trimmed gains. At the close, September stood at 193.75 cents, its highest settlement in eight weeks, up 8.80 cents -- or nearly five percent -- on the day.</p>
<p>Second-month December rose 6.40 cents, to 168.70 cents, while the back months closed 3.00 to 4.25 cents higher.</p>
<p>The September/December switch, a barometer of near-term availability, bulged to 25.05 cents compared with 22.65 cents at the close on Friday.</p>
<p>While no fresh news was seen behind today's run-up, traders said ongoing concerns about the availability of exchange-certified coffees for delivery against the September contract continued to underpin the market.</p>
<p>&quot;To some degree this market is being driven by the same fundamental aspect: supply,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The fact is that there is less producer selling into September because they don't have any coffee.</p>
<p>Some traders speculated that roaster demand will pick up in the coming weeks ahead of the peak, winter consumption season in North America, but worried there would be little premium coffees available until the start of the new-crop harvest in many Latin American countries this autumn.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not going to be much coffee around for when demand picks up,&quot; said South Futures president Stephen Smith. &quot;And right now there is no reason to sell it. There's no coffee to be hedged.&quot;</p>
<p>Additionally, some traders said a report by Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes fueled bullish sentiment. In a bi-weekly report released July 31, Ganes said lean supplies ahead of the new-crop harvest as well as continued dry weather in Central America could push coffee futures over $2, and as high as $2.30-$2.50 if the dry conditions in Central America persist.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said today's run-up accelerated after the September contract breached resistance at 190.00 cents, triggering buy-stops.</p>
<p>&quot;Once it got through 190, it gave the market a technical boost,&quot; said Refco's Prendergast. &quot;It got over 195, but it could not hold. There just wasn't a sense of urgency.&quot;</p>
<p>Market participants continued to note that relatively low volume and slim total open interest exaggerated the market's movement.</p>
<p>As of August 1, total open interest stood at 20,637 lots, down 1,157 lots from the previous session.</p>
<p>On the charts, traders pegged September resistance at 198.00 cents, while support was seen near 190.00 cents.</p>
<p>After Monday's close the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell by 750 60-kg bags as of August 1, to 94,741 bags. An additional 4,429 bags were pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>Volume on the day reached an estimated 6,814 lots.</p>
