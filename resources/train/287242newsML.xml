<p>Holders Manchester United overcame an unjury-hit but spirited Tottenham 2-0 in a typically hard-fought F.A. Cup third round match at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
<p>The match between the two most successful clubs in the 126-year history of the competition tipped United's way in the 50th minute when Paul Scholes scored with a well-placed 15-metre angled shot that Tottenham keeper Ian Walker had no chance of saving.</p>
<p>David Beckham wrapped the match up 10 minutes from time with a superb goal direct from a 25-metre free kick after Colin Calderwood had fouled Ryan Giggs.</p>
<p>Tottenham had six first team players -- with a combined value of 17.5 million pounds -- out with illness or injury and played 19-year-old debutant Neale Fenn in attack alongside another 19-year-old, Rory Allen, starting only his eighth match.</p>
<p>Allen had a chance to equalise for Spurs a minute after United went ahead, but shot wide from an acute angle.</p>
<p>Tottenham emerged from the match with their pride restored after their 7-1 drubbing at Newcastle two weeks ago, but little else.</p>
<p>Out of the League Cup and the title race, their season is effectively over, while United move into the fourth round and stay on course for what would be an unprecedented fourth successive F.A. Cup final appearance.</p>
<p>United will play either Crewe or Wimbledon at Old Trafford in the next round.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Manchester United - 1-Peter Schmeichel, 2-Gary Neville, 3-Denis Irwin (13-Brian McClair 52), 4-David May, 19-Ronny Johnsen, 16-Roy Keane, 7-Eric Cantona, 10-David Beckham, 11-Ryan Giggs, 9-Andy Cole (20-Ole Solksjaer 79), 18-Paul Scholes</p>
