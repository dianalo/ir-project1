<p>Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, at the centre of a storm after making a Hitler-style salute to Tottenham fans in a recent match, was found guilty of misconduct by the English Football Association on Friday and fined 1,000 pounds ( $1,660).</p>
<p>The Australian keeper was also severely censured, warned as to his future conduct and ordered to pay the costs of the F.A. Commission hearing.</p>
<p>Announcing the decision, F.A. spokesman Steve Double said: &quot;The Comission heard that Bosnich had been subjected to abusive chanting from the home crowd before the incident in the 48th minute.</p>
<p>&quot;Bosnich told the Commission that his gesture to the crowd was intended as a Basil Fawlty-style joke. He was unaware of Tottenham's Jewish following and was devastated at the reaction to the incident.&quot;</p>
<p>Double added: &quot;He stated that he abhorred racism. The Commission decided that, while Bosnich's action was an act of stupidity, it was not his intention to cause offence or be insulting.</p>
<p>&quot;He apologised publicly, quickly and profusely.&quot;</p>
<p>Villa manager Brian Little emerged from the hour and a half meeting satisfied with the outcome. He said: &quot;It has been a fair hearing.&quot;</p>
<p>Bosnich was relieved with the outcome of the hearing, saying: &quot;What we have seen today is commonsense prevail. Let's hope I can now put this incident behind me and go forward with my career.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the fine imposed by the Commission, he said: &quot;It's time to put this behind me there are far more important things going on than this case and to be honest I'm sick of hearing my own voice.&quot;</p>
<p>The outcome will come as a relief to the 24-year-old player who could have been suspended. But he is still waiting to hear if he will face police action over the gesture.</p>
