<p>Sierra Leone's new army rulers said on Wednesday they had released 313 Nigerian troops who surrendered during fighting on Monday and whom they had threatened to use as human shields.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Sesay told reporters the Sierra Leone army had taken the 300 men and 13 officers to the Nigerian base from the Wilberforce barracks where they had been held.  </p>
<p>Sesay described the release as a goodwill gesture for talks between leaders of a May 25 coup and West African negotiators seeking return of the ousted civilian government.</p>
<p>Nigerian gunboats bombarded Freetown on Monday after talks collapsed on Sunday night, and rebels allied to the coup makers attacked Nigerian soldiers protecting foreigners at a hotel.</p>
<p>Reporters who met the Nigerian soldiers, from the West African ECOMOG force, said they told them they had surrendered because they were in Sierra Leone to promote peace, not to fight Sierra Leoneans.</p>
<p>A Ghanaian delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho and Brigadier Seth Obeng, the chief of staff at army headquarters, was due in Freetown on Wednesday for more talks after meeting ECOMOG commanders in Liberia on Tuesday, Ghanaian media reported.</p>
