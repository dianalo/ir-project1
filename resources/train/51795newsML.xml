<p>Iran said on Friday it would be &quot;quite sorry&quot; if the U.S. launched a fresh strike against Iraq and predicted that any new Gulf War would be short-lived, saying Iraq did not have the capacity to resist.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be quite sorry if such an attack should take place because a number of people also would be victimised,&quot; visiting Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani told reporters in South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe it would be a long war, since Iraq does not have the readiness for such a move,&quot; Rafsanjani said.</p>
<p>Amid reports of major U.S. military build-up in the Gulf, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted a military spokesman in Baghdad as saying U.S. and allied aircraft had made 42 sorties over its air space, but did not report any exchanges of fire.   </p>
<p>Rafsanjani, after meeting South African President Nelson Mandela on Friday morning, said the U.S. had boosted tension in Iraq in order to keep a grip on the region. But he also blamed Baghdad for giving the Americans the chance.</p>
<p>&quot;There are objectives pursued by the United States by creating such tension and that is to preserve their illegitimate presence in the Persian Gulf and Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;And of course Iraq has provided them with this pretext which is not right, by its invasion of Kuwait and its recent invasion of the Kurds (Kurdish lands),&quot; he said through an interpreter.</p>
<p>Mandela said only the United Nations had the authority to sort out international problems.</p>
<p>&quot;No country is entitled to assume the role of policeman,&quot; he said after his 20-minute meeting with the Iranian leader who was on his last leg of a six-nation African tour.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not condone the action of Iraq because...if there is any problem they have with any country, I would expect them to respect the United Nations charter,&quot; Mandela said.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani did not comment on a U.N. report on Friday that 30,000 Kurds from northern Iraq had fled to Iran.</p>
<p>U.S. ships and assault planes closed in on Iraq on Friday preparing to further punish President Saddam Hussein for attempts by his air defence force to shoot down American fighter planes policing a no-fly zone in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Mandela, who brushed aside U.S. displeasure over his decision to host Rafsanjani for a full state visit, said no country had the right to dictate South Africa's foreign policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not prepared to do that at the expense of our friends who were with us when we were all alone, when many superpowers were supporting our enemies, the apartheid regime.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who were with us when we were all alone will continue to be our friends.&quot;</p>
