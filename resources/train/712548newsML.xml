<p>Sterling soared to a six-year high on Tuesday after an unexpectedly strong rise in British inflation but later relinquished some of its gains as market sentiment about aggressive interest-rate rises eased.</p>
<p>The underlying rate of price inflation jumped above the government's 2.5 percent target, hitting 2.7 percent in June. The headline annual inflation rate, which includes mortgage payments, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.6 in May.</p>
<p>It was the highest figure for headline inflation since January 1996 and made investors even more certain of another rise in interest rates this week.</p>
<p>Shares fell on the gloomy inflation news and the price of government bonds also dropped.</p>
<p>The strong pound, which is already hurting British exporters, jumped to a new six-year high over 2.97 German marks, up over three pfennigs from late prices seen in Europe. But by 1500 GMT it had given back more than a pfennig of those gains.</p>
<p>Dealers cited vague rumours of the Bank of England selling in the foreign currency markets. But more concrete was a reevaluation of the inflation figures.</p>
<p>Much of the rise in prices last month was due to a five percent leap in volatile seasonal food prices as unusually wet weather soaked Britain's crops.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's nervousness about this week's meeting is understandable but setting interest rates according to the weather might be stretching the bearishness a little too far,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>Sterling's leap was powered by market talk of a half-point rise in British interest rates from the newly-independent Bank of England which starts its monthly meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the consensus is still firmly pointing to a more modest, quarter-point increase, continuing the recent trend for small rate adjustments. The Bank will signal its decision at at midday on Thursday. -    Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International Europe, agreed comfort could be drawn from the impact of food prices in last month's inflation figures. But he added, &quot;The underlying tone from this set of data is obviously disappointing and does point in a direction of a rate rise.&quot;</p>
<p>Interest rates have already risen three times since last October and speculation of another rise intensified after last week's budget from the new Labour government. The budget raised the tax burden by around six billion pounds, but most of the measures hit business and did little to restrain sharply rising consumer demand.</p>
<p>A consumer boom fuelled partly by windfall payouts from demutualised building societies as well as rising wages is risking an inflation push that is only being masked by the anti-inflationary impact of the strong pound.</p>
<p>Inflation risks taking off as soon as the pound starts easing, which could happen once interest rates are believed to have peaked.</p>
<p>But in the short run, exporters are expecting more pain from a pound which many in the market say could be on its way up to three marks after the next interest rate increase.</p>
<p>The impact is already being felt, with new figures out on Tuesday showing second-quarter export orders from British engineering firms at their lowest level in three years.</p>
<p>British stocks reacted badly to the inflation news, with the FTSE 100 share index falling steadily through the day to stand down 52.2 points at 4,758.5 by the close. It had posted a new record high of 4,879 just days ago.</p>
<p>Government bond prices remained generally lower with the September gilt future shedding 5/32 to 114-21, off an earlier low of 114-15.</p>
<p>British interest rate futures are certainly pricing in another round of monetary tightening. The September short sterling future, which dropped four basis points to 92.81 on Tuesday, is discounting base rates a half-point higher at seven percent by the end of the third quarter.</p>
