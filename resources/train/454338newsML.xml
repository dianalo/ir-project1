<p>A World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute panel has found the European Union's banana regime favouring imports from mainly Caribbean countries violates open trading rules, diplomats said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said an interim report from the three-man panel in effect came down in favour of a complaint by the United States and four Latin American states that the EU regime discriminated against their marketing companies and producers.</p>
<p>The report, issued after nearly 10 months of deliberations, recommended that the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) ask Brussels to bring the regime into line with its obligations under global trade accords, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;As I see it, the report goes to the heart of the regime. I cannot see how the EU can avoid doing something about bringing its current practices into conformity with the agreements it has signed up to,&quot; said one trade envoy.</p>
<p>The finding, which has to be confirmed in a final report to be issued publicly once comments have come in from all six countries involved, will come as a bitter blow to small Caribbean banana-producing states, trade analysts said.</p>
<p>They and the EU have argued that unless the preferences they enjoy for exports of the fruit to the European market are maintained, their economies will collapse under competition from the much larger-scale banana industry of Latin America.</p>
<p>The main Caribbean states involved are Jamaica, Belize, Surinam and the Windward Islands. Bananas are a key item in their foreign trade.</p>
<p>According to the diplomats, the panellists from Hong Kong, Switzerland and Australia found that the 1993 EU regime ran against several articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and against a linked services accord (GATS).</p>
<p>Once the report has been finalised, the EU can ask the DSB's Appellate Body for a review. But if that finding goes against it, under the tough WTO rules Brussels will have to fall in with the recommendations or face WTO-approved sanctions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it could maintain the regime but pay compensation to the United States and the four Latin American countries -- Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico -- to the value of the trade they are losing because of it.</p>
<p>The dispute has sparked a war of words between Washington and Brussels, who in an exchange of statements made public on Tuesday accused each other of distortion and misrepresentation in the public pursuit of the case.</p>
<p>In a document issued in Brussels, the EU said U.S. arguments on the issue were &quot;at a minimum groundless and indeed aim at distorting the reality&quot; of the regime and the impact of its abolition, the statement declared.</p>
<p>If successful U.S. strategy &quot;would lead directly to the destruction of the Caribbean banana industry&quot; and provoke severe hardship and political instability in a region already struggling against deprivation, it said.</p>
<p>The regime is part of the system of trade preferences granted by Brussels to countries of the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group under their 1993 Lome Convention.</p>
<p>A counter-statement from Washington distributed by the U.S. WTO mission in Geneva said the Brussels document contained &quot;numerous fallacies&quot; and ignored special advantages the regime gave to EU-based banana marketing companies.</p>
<p>The import-licencing system that forms part of the 1993 regime, the U.S. statement said, had deprived U.S. banana distribution companies Chiquita and Dole of half of their business in the EU.</p>
<p>Panels under the WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), twice found against earlier versions of the EU regime, but Brussels blocked adoption of the two reports -- as it was allowed to do under GATT rules.</p>
