<p>Compromise legislation calling for greater efforts by Mexico in anti-drug war may come to a Senate vote on Thursday if Democrats agree to ease a threat to block debate.</p>
<p>The Democrats were to caucus before Thursday's Senate session to decide whether to carry out the gridlock threat in an effort to force Republicans to set a date for consideration of a treaty outlawing chemical weapons.</p>
<p>The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and efforts to chastise Mexico for its perceived laxity in tackling drug trafficking into the United States became linked early on Wednesday when Democratic Leader Tom Daschle issued his threat saying, &quot;I think it's the only leverage we've got.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that any Mexico measure would be a victim, although at that point key senators and Clinton administration officials were still negotiating the terms of the legislation.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, a Senate source said agreement on the Mexico issue had been reached - and an aide to Daschle said that talks between Daschle and Lott on freeing the treaty &quot;look potentially promising&quot; altrhough there had been no assurances.</p>
<p>The aide said that Daschle needed to discuss the matter with the caucus.</p>
<p>The 11th hour agreement on the Mexico legislation followed further concessions by senators to accommodate administration concerns, the source said. There was no immediate comment from the administration.</p>
<p>A major sticking point for the administration had been a provision that gave Congress a further role in assessing Mexico's progress in stepping up its anti-drug war.</p>
<p>An earlier draft had set the stage for a congressional vote on the adequacy of the response of both Mexico and the United States following a presidential report to Congress due by Sept. 1.</p>
<p>This provision was eliminated in the final version, the source said.</p>
<p>Unlike a measure approved by the House last week, the Senate compromise does not overturn President Bill Clinton's finding that Mexico is cooperating in the anti-drug war.</p>
<p>Like the House version, it sets a number of goals for action to step up the anti-drug fight, but they apply to both Mexico and the United States.</p>
