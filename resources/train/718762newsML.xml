<p>Violent protests for political reforms in Kenya have upset investors, and many are so wary of this emerging market that turnover on the Nairobi stock exchange has slumped to a year low.</p>
<p>A senior executive at the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) said some fund managers had asked brokers to hold their orders until there was enough evidence that violent confrontations would not worsen in coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;Some foreign investors have asked brokers to hold onto their orders. There have been no cancellations so far and that means the interest is still there,&quot; said a senior broker.</p>
<p>Foreign investors are drawn to Kenya to place short-term funds because of the relatively high returns offered by its debt and stock markets, bankers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Returns from the bourse here are as high as 25 percent and no investors will make speedy decisions. They will wait for fresh direction,&quot; the broker said, adding that assessing events such as the violence could take up to three months.</p>
<p>Total turnover in June was quoted at 754 million shillings and a bourse official said on Wednesday that such brisk business was now unlikely in July.</p>
<p>This week, the NSE recorded daily turnovers in the range of five million to seven million shillings, the lowest in the year.</p>
<p>The Kenyan shilling has taken a beating since Monday on panic-triggered demand for dollars after the violence.</p>
<p>Commercial bank dealers said even central bank intervention had not stemmed a weakening shilling. The bank was said to be watching the market and studying levels of intervention.</p>
<p>The shilling slipped to around 56.50/65 versus the dollar on Wednesday compared to 54.90 at the close on Friday last week. The shilling eased further to the 57 range on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nine people were killed in Kenya on Monday during the worst clashes between police and protesters since a violent campaign in July 1990 that helped persuade President Daniel arap Moi to allow multi-party politics.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, human rights and church groups in the National Convention Assembly have pledged further action to force Moi to allow minimum constitutional reforms before presidential and parliamentary elections later this year.</p>
<p>Central Bank of Kenya Governor Micah Cheserem said the shilling had suffered on market jitters after the unrest from Monday but this would be temporary. He said he saw sanity prevailing on both sides of the political divide.</p>
<p>Unstable weather has affected tea and coffee output, Kenya's main commodity exports. This has put further pressure on the currency market, according to senior dealers.</p>
