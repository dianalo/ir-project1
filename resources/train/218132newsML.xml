<p>The International Grains Council (IGC) on Tuesday projected the 1997 world wheat crop at 580 million tonnes, five million tonnes higher than the estimate for 1996.</p>
<p>In its latest montly report, the IGC said some recovery could be expected in the output of Central and Eastern Europe, the former republics of the Soviet Union and the United States.</p>
<p>China and the European Union (EU) might sustain their high level of production but Australia and Argentina were unlikely to see a repeat of this season's bumper crops, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers demonstrated their ability to respond to price changes as official support schemes are gradually reduced or modified...lower prices for wheat might therefore be expected to lead to a reduction in sowings, and switch to other crops and enterprises,&quot; the IGC said.</p>
<p>In Canada, for example, where the bulk of wheat is spring sown, production decisions would be strongly influenced by price levels for other crops.</p>
<p>The wheat area in the EU could increase with the reduction in set-aside from 10 percent to five percent last season.</p>
<p>The IGC said a growing preference for high yielding varieties in some member states could also contribute to another large harvest, but the record average yield of 1996 might not be repeated.</p>
<p>But winter wheat growing conditions in the EU are said to be ideal.</p>
<p>Conditions were reported to be better than last year in the United States, but the sown area could be slightly lower, the IGC said.</p>
<p>India would remain vulnerable to moisture shortages as only a third of the sown area is irrigated. Crops have benefited strongly from a succession of good monsoons in recent years.</p>
<p>Russia'a output could continue to decline and its import requirements would largely depend on whether the livestock industry regains its strength.</p>
<p>Problems were reported with the availability and poor quality of seed grain and ploughing of winter and spring crops were down, the IGC said.</p>
<p>Ukraine was expecting a better crop and Uzbekistan was planning to increase wheat production and cease imports.</p>
