<p>French President Jacques Chirac will paint an upbeat picture of job prospects for disillusioned young people in a television interview on Monday widely-seen as helping to set the stage for next year's general elections.</p>
<p>Aides said Chirac's message in the 1940 GMT broadcast, before an audience of young people and company heads at a futuristic science park, would be &quot;go-getting, mobilising&quot;.</p>
<p>Unemployment and a 25 percent jobless rate among 18 to 25 year-olds is top of the agenda in the run-up to general elections early next year.</p>
<p>In the past week the centre-right government has been buffeted by car-maker Renault's decision to close a Belgian plant and lay off 3,100 workers. The opposition Socialists have pledged to find work for 700,000 young people if elected.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is to highlight the president's ambition to move French society forward, to emphasise the importance of movement. It's a step in his crusade for jobs for the young,&quot; a Chirac aide said.</p>
<p>The head of state would &quot;speak of the future, of confidence, of hope&quot; for jobs for the young. One aide said the aim was to show Chirac as &quot;modern...a man marching with great strides towards the 21st century&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Operation Reconquest&quot;, headlined the daily Le Parisien, saying Chirac would try to charm young voters who played a big part in his 1995 election but who today are the hardest-hit victims of economic gloom.</p>
<p>Even the show's title &quot;The year 2,000, a chance for all?&quot; echoes Chirac's presidential campaign slogan: &quot;France for all&quot;.</p>
<p>Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF, junior partner in the ruling coalition, warned the government at the weekend: &quot;The Socialists were swept from power by unemployment and corruption scandals&quot;.</p>
<p>He said he awaited &quot;an audacious jobs policy&quot; from the government, whose Gaullist RPR component is plagued by a host of corruption investigations.</p>
<p>But an opinion poll published by the weekly Le Journal du Dimanche showed young people had much more confidence in themselves (65 percent) or in their parents (40 percent) than in the president (13 percent) to &quot;prepare their future and that of our society&quot;.</p>
<p>Half the 807 people questioned said the word &quot;unemployment&quot; was the best term to describe their generation.</p>
<p>In recent months, Chirac has criss-crossed the country to visit job initiatives for the young. To help prepare for the interview, he met company bosses from across France on Thursday to discuss training and apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Six French and Belgian trade unions have called a new demonstration for Tuesday at Renault's headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt just outside Paris.</p>
<p>More labour protests are also due this week in the hospital sector, with unions fighting layoffs decreed by the government's welfare reforms. Unions have put the number of job losses at 15,000-20,000.</p>
<p>In a rare protest, journalists at state-owned France-2 television have accused the channel of giving Chirac's team too much say over the programme and of choosing relatively-inexperienced reporters for features on schooling, companies and immigrants.</p>
