<p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady at its Tuesday policy making meeting was good news for the economy, business lobbyists and unions said.</p>
<p>The Fed's inaction would give the economy more time to prove its recent vigor will not fuel inflation, said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;We're happy with their decision,&quot; Regalia said. &quot;There's clear-cut evidence the economy is slowing with no inflation around right now. To have raised rates on the anticipation of inflation would have been extremely myopic.&quot;</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee ended its meeting with no announcement on interest rates, indicating it had held the federal funds rate target at 5.50 percent and the discount rate at 5.00 percent.  </p>
<p>Optimistic economists have insisted the economy can keep growing and creating jobs without significantly boosting inflation, even as the U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 23-year low of 4.9 percent in April.</p>
<p>Fed officials have cited wage pressures as a harbinger of general inflation growth, but labor leaders say the job market still has ample slack to supply workers at prevailing wages.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed's decision was certainly a relief to working families,&quot; said Sheldon Friedman, an economist at the AFL-CIO, a federation of 78 labor unions.</p>
<p>Many observers had predicted a slight increase in rates at the meeting, but a slight majority -- 21 of 39 economists in the latest Reuters poll -- had expected no change.</p>
<p>The Fed came under heavy criticism from a broad range of business and consumer advocates as well as lawmakers after it raised the fed funds rate a quarter percentage point at its last FOMC meeting on March 25.</p>
<p>Some analysts had speculated that criticism would give the Fed pause at today's meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;To me, there was an unusual amount of criticism of the last rate hike,&quot; Friedman said. &quot;Even their own (community) advisory councils ... were pretty much unanimously advising the Fed there was no reason to raise rates.&quot;  </p>
<p>Yet economists know the Fed will likely remain on alert for potential further rate hikes in coming months, barring a sharp slowdown in economic growth ahead of the next FOMC meeting on July 1-2.</p>
<p>&quot;With the Fed, you have to prove it beyond a shadow of doubt, not just a reasonable doubt,&quot; said Regalia. &quot;I suppose we'll have to go through the same dance in July.&quot;</p>
