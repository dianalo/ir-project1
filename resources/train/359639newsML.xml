<p>European footballer of the year Matthias Sammer is considering extending his contract at Borussia Dortmund in a deal that would keep him at the club for the rest of his playing career.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old libero, whose contract with the German champions runs until 1999, said it was too early to make a commitment but the prospects for an extension were good.</p>
<p>&quot;If I decide to stay at Dortmund until the end of my career, then everything must be right. The way things look at the moment, everything is right,&quot; he told Thursday's edition of the German sports magazine Kicker.</p>
<p>&quot;But we'll all sit down at the end of the year or the beginning of 1998 and make a final decision.&quot;</p>
<p>Sammer said Dortmund would have to maintain their progress of the past few years, when they have gone from Bundesliga also-rans to being among Europe's biggest names, and top officials would have to remain in place for him to consider staying.</p>
<p>Sammer, awarded the Golden Ball in December after being voted European player of 1996 by the continent's sportswriters, was linked with a possible move to Dortmund's title rivals Bayern Munich last year.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pleased I didn't fall for the allure of Bayern,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel really happy at Borussia at the moment.&quot;</p>
