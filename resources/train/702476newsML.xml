<p>Afghanistan's purist Islamic Taleban militia was advancing towards the opposition-held capital of the northeastern province of Takhar on Wednesday, a Pakistan-based Afghan news service said.</p>
<p>The Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported that the militia had launched a major offensive against opposition forces in Takhar from neighbouring Kunduz province on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The attackers broke through opposition frontlines and thrust into Khwaja Ghar and Bangi districts, where fighting was going on about 30 km (19 miles) west of Taloqan, the provincial capital. The militia earlier captured the Qabr-i-Qazi district, east of Kunduz, AIP said.</p>
<p>It said the Taleban had killed 20 soldiers loyal to former government military commander Ahmed Shah Masood and captured 135 after intense fighting in which the Taleban lost three dead.</p>
<p>AIP said local commanders had joined the Taleban offensive, swelling the militia's ranks to 1,500 from an initial 1,000.</p>
<p>Several opposition leaders, including ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ittehad-i-Islami chief Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf, have used Taloqan as a temporary base since the Taleban drove the Rabbani government from Kabul in September.</p>
<p>AIP said two helicopters had taken off from Taloqan for an undisclosed destination on Tuesday, apparently with opposition leaders on board, but could not identify them.</p>
<p>No other reports of the fighting were immediately available.</p>
