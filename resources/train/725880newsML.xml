<p>Three MPs resigned from Tansu Ciller's True Path Party on Monday, adding to a string of resignations which have sapped the party's parliamentary strength and helped the new secularist government into power.</p>
<p>Dogan Gures, a career army officer who served as Turkey's chief of general staff for four years before becoming an MP in 1995, submitted his resignation early on Monday morning, state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>His resignation was followed later in the day by those of Mahmut Yilbas and Mustafa Zeydan, deputies from eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>The three were among seven MPs from Ciller's True Path who failed to attend a crucial confidence vote on Turkey's new secularist government on Saturday. The seven faced disciplinary measures by True Path, Turkish newspapers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The government, a loose alliance of left and right parties, won the vote against opposition from the previous coalition of Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party and Ciller's True Path.</p>
<p>The confidence motion came two weeks after the collapse of Erbakan and Ciller's government, following months of dispute with Turkey's fiercely secularist army.</p>
<p>Gures said in his letter of resignation, quoted by Anatolian, he had tried to persuade the pro-Western True Path to enter a coalition with other secularist parties and break its alliance with Welfare.</p>
<p>The number of True Path deputies has shrunk from 135 after the last election in 1995 to 95 on Monday as a result of the resignations and defections. The latest MPs to quit have not said whether they will join another party.</p>
