<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch call rate squeezes up, but relief expected.</title>
<headline>Dutch call rate squeezes up, but relief expected.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-11-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch call money rates rose further on Monday as the market was somewhat short of liquidity, but an extra inflow of funds was expected on Tuesday which could bring rates a little lower again.</p>
<p>Dealers said the settlement of Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs), the short-term borrowing programme of the Dutch government, could be behind the current rise in the cost of overnight money. &quot;Those settlements pull liquidity out of the market,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>But another said some 700 million guilders in public health insurance funds were expected to flow into the market tomorrow.</p>
<p>Call money rates rose to 2.87 percent bid in mid-afternoon on Monday, after the rate jumped to 2.75 percent on Friday from a low of 2.38 percent bid on Thursday.</p>
<p>Other rates were stable, and dealers noted most trade in two- and three-month deposits. Three-month deposits were bid at 2.92 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said they did not expect any changes in official rates till the year-end as the guilder remained stable versus the German mark and recent economic data did not require a rate movement.</p>
<p>The guilder was steady at 112.1425 per 100 marks from 112.145 on Friday.</p>
