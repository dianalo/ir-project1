<headline>FOCUS - Alliance shares surge above expectations.</headline>

<p>Shares in Alliance &amp; Leicester, Britain's newest bank, exceeded all expectations when they made their debut on Monday.</p>
<p>The former building society's shares opened on the London Stock Exchange at 542.5 pence, later rising to 557 pence before settling back to 552.5 pence at 0940 GMT. This compared with a maximum anticipated float price of around 510 pence.</p>
<p>The shares were handed out to savers and borrowers with Alliance &amp; Leicester, formerly a mutually-owned building society. At the highest price, they would receive a windfall of around 1,390 pounds ($2,270) for their allocation of 250 shares.</p>
<p>Alliance &amp; Leicester chief executive Peter White said the flotation marked the beginning of a new era for the company. The entire conversion process had been completed more quickly than any of the other building societies due to convert into banks in 1997.</p>
<p>Analysts expressed surpise at the opening price for the Alliance shares. Trading in them dominated early stock market activity with around 37 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is watching Alliance &amp; Leicester,&quot; said one banking analyst, adding that the price was considerably higher than expected and that much of the early volume was individual shareholders selling their free share entitlement through brokers.</p>
<p>Alliance is the first former building society to ditch its mutual tradition, where it was owned by its savers and borrowers, in favour of the freedom of bank status as a publicly listed company.</p>
<p>It is due to be followed by Britain's biggest home loan provider the Halifax, the Woolwich, Northern Rock and Bristol &amp; West, which is to merge with Bank of Ireland in a 600 million pound deal.</p>
<p>The demutualisation bug has also gripped two life insurers which also plan to go public, joining in a process which involves a massive widening of share ownership in Britain.</p>
<p>Billions of pounds are due to be paid out in windfalls to savers, borrowers and policyholders.</p>
<p>Alliance becomes one of Britain's largest quoted companies, with a market capitalisation in excess of three billion pounds given the 582 million shares which the company said had been issued.</p>
<p>This would make it around 70 in the list of Britain's largest quoted firms at the 549.5 pence level, although it will not formally join the FTSE 100 index until June.</p>
<p>Earlier Alliance announced details of an auction, held last Friday by stockbrokers Cazenove, of free shares sold by members under a special scheme to institutional investors.</p>
<p>The average price bid was 522 pence and more than 52 million shares were bid for by a total of 36 bidders. Some 27 percent of qualifying shareholders opted to sell their holdings straight away through the scheme.</p>
<p>A second auction of the same number of shares is due to be held later on Monday and a third is due to take place on Tuesday afternoon. Analysts said the big question was how well bid the shares would be at the second auction.</p>
<p>&quot;You wonder how much the market will be cajoled into bidding (for the shares),&quot; said one. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)</p>
