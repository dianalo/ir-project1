<title>USA: RESEARCH ALERT - Quaker Oats EPS view cut.</title>
<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Quaker Oats EPS view cut.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Michael Mauboussin said Tuesday he reduced his 1997 earnings estimate for Quaker Oats Co to $1.50 a share from $1.80. He also established a 1998 earnings estimate of $1.80 a share.</p>
<p>-- His annual 1996 estimate remains $1.33 a share, with a fourth quarter earnings estimate of $0.12 a share compared with a loss of $0.18 a year ago.</p>
<p>-- The fourth quarter and full-year 1996 estimates exclude any potential charges, which Mauboussin said he expects. In a report, Mauboussin said he expects Quaker to write off about $1.0 billion for its Snapple beverage business.  </p>
<p>-- Quaker Oats shares were down 2-1/8 at 36-5/8.</p>
<p>-- Mauboussin said he expects Snapple to have another year of losses in 1997.</p>
<p>--  The analyst said the investment case for Quaker, which he rates a buy, has hinged on an expected restructuring.     --</p>
<p>He added he is evaluating the investment thesis.</p>
<p>-- Mauboussin said he valued Quaker's Gatorade sports drink business at $2.09 billion, Snapple at $300 million, its North American food business at $3.85 billion and its international food business at $450 million.</p>
<p>-- &quot;We have taken a view that restructuring actions, most likely including Gatorade and/or (a) significant part of the food business, would have to be pursued to create value for shareholders,&quot; Mauboussin said. &quot;This has not happened, and we believe the likelihood of a Pepsi/Quaker Oats deal has diminished following Pepsi's announcement of the restaurant spin-off.&quot;</p>
<p>-- PepsiCo Inc had been among the companies rumored to be interested in acquiring Quaker's beverage business. Neither Quaker nor Pepsi has commented on those rumors. PepsiCo has said it will spin off its restaurants.</p>
