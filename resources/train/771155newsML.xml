<headline>Shanghai B shares up at noon on light retail demand.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-07-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shanghai B shares were marginally higher at midday on Thursday, buoyed by light bargain hunting by retail investors as institutions kept to the sidelines, brokers said.</p>
<p>Institutions were awaiting the release of interim corporate profits due over the next month, they said.</p>
<p>There was little market response to news that economic tsar Zhu Rongji urged lumbering state firms to look to stock markets as a means to raise capital rather than relying on credit.</p>
<p>The B share index edged up 0.192 point or 0.26 percent to 73.123 at midday.  </p>
<p>Volume was 2.6 million shares worth $1.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Bargain-hunting emerged after the losses over the past few days, but trading was not active amid unclear market direction,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Brokers put technical support at the 73-point level.</p>
<p>Major newspapers prominently reported the remarks of Vice Premier Zhu during a recent tour of the hard hit state sector in the industrial province of Liaoning.</p>
<p>Zhu also called on state firms that had listed their shares not to believe that a public offer was a ticket to do as they pleased.  </p>
<p>&quot;Zhu's comments were a positive factor for the market,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the market lacks capital to start a bull run amid overseas institutions turned their interest to the Hong Kong stock market,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>Of the 45 B share issues, 30 were traded, with 12 gaining ground. Nine fell and nine were unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Yaohua Pilkington Glass was the morning's star performer on speculative demand, surging $0.026 or 8.02 percent to $0.350 on thin volume of 23,000 shares.  </p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index extended its advance as Zhu's comments appeared to suggest a cautious note of official encouragement for the market.</p>
<p>The index gained 7.575 points or 0.61 percent to 1,243.031 points on volume of 148.9 million shares worth 1.6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index put on 52.059 points or 1.40 percent to 3,763.258 points.</p>
<p>Huanghe Machinery and Electronics was the big gainer on talk of improved results, rising 0.31 yuan or 6.60 percent to 5.00 yuan on volume of 2.7 million shares.  </p>
