<p>Polish bank BIG, which has recently upped its stake in meat processor Sokolow SA, will either have to sell part of the equity or announce a tender to buy the firm's remaining stake, the bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bank's spokesman Wojciech Kaczorowski said this obligation stemmed from the Securities Commission's regulation forcing a shareholder which wants to acquire more that 10 percent of a firm in less than 90 days to announce a public tender offer for the firm's remaining common shares.</p>
<p>Kaczorowski told Reuters that BIG, whose full name is Bank Inicjatyw Gospodarczych SA, would now have to buy up or sell some of the Sokolow shares because its subsidiary  Bel Leasing Sp z oo, increased its stake in the company by 10 percent in less than 90 days.</p>
<p>&quot;We are analyzing the issue from the legal point of view to see what we can do. There seem to be two possibilities either we will have to announce a tender or sell some of the shares to get below 20 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added BIG would take the decision in the next several days.</p>
<p>He said that the increasing the stake by 10 percent in less than 90 days was an omission.</p>
<p>On October 1, Bel Leasing bought shares in Sokolow giving it a 5.2-percent stake and on December 17 it reported it had 14.99 percent. In February it said it bought additional shares, increasing its stake to 22 percent.</p>
