<p>The Zimbabwe dollar was quoted mixed against hard currencies at the close of Tuesday's interbank trading session, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the local currency appreciated as far as 11.2775/2875 on the U.S. dollar from 11.2900/3000 earlier, buoyed by inflows which the central bank was however quick to mop up.</p>
<p>&quot;We had inflows of roughly between U.S.$7 million and U.S.$8 million but the central bank came in heavily, buying U.S. dollars from the market,&quot; one dealer said, adding: &quot;Otherwise there wasn't much on the import side today.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers say despite a steady inflow of foreign currency from ongoing annual tobacco sales, the Reserve Bank is likely to be at pains to block any appreciation in the local dollar, given current inflation of 22.4 percent, a rise over the previous 19.9 percent.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwe dollar finished on Tuesday at 11.2925/3025 against the U.S. dollar, weakening slightly from Friday's 11.2900/3000, but was quoted firmer on sterling at 18.4045/4320 compared to 18.4150/4450, tracking a firmer U.S. dollar overseas.</p>
<p>It also gained over the mark to 6.6500/6580 from 6.6760/6800 but eased to 2.5220/5260 against the rand from 2.5200/5250.</p>
