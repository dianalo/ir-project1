<p>CSCE cocoa futures were called to open $10 to $15 a tonne lower Thursday, dealers said, as weakness in the British pound sterling versus the U.S. dollar is expected to prompt operators to switch over to sterling-denominated London cocoa.</p>
<p>&quot;We were called $5 lower on the London market, but with the currency we were called $10 to $15 lower,&quot; one New York trader said.</p>
<p>London cocoa futures were mainly lower early Thursday despite ther weaker sterling. Benchmark LIFFE March was down six stg at 884 stg a tonne, having retested support at 880 stg.</p>
<p>New York cocoa futures settled sharply higher Tuesday in a correction following four consecutive days of losses. March cocoa rallied $20 a tonne, to close at $1,374, after ranging from $1,359 to $1,379.</p>
<p>The CSCE was closed January 1 in observance of New Year's Day.</p>
<p>On the charts, $1,380-1,382 was seen as a key upside target for March, while support was pegged at $1,355.</p>
