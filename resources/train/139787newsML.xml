<p>Zairean troops pulled back in confusion in eastern Zaire on Thursday in the face of a Tutsi rebel advance uprooting nearly 300,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Tutsis rebels known as Banyamulenge said their forces captured three eastern towns and were besieging the South Kivu provincial capital of Bukavu at the centre of the refugee crisis.</p>
<p>Muller Ruhimbika, Rwanda spokesman for the Banyamulenge's People Democratic Alliance, told Reuters the rebels were joined by the Kaasai, Shaba and Katangese groups and had captured and controlled the Zairean towns of Kamanyola, Nyangezi and Bwegera.</p>
<p>The Kaasai, Shaba and Katangese have led armed opposition to President Mobutu Sese Seko since the 1960s. They almost seized mineral-rich Shaba province in 1978 before French intervention.</p>
<p>But Ruhimbika in Kigali said all the 300,000 Banyamulenge wanted was their property stolen by troops and militiamen and the granting of Zairean citizenship, denied to them in 1981.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66, is receiving chemotherapy as an outpatient at a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, after being operated on for prostate cancer on August 22, according to Swiss media.</p>
<p>Zairean troops stopped journalists from driving to Nyangezi and soldiers confirmed both Kamanyola and Bwegera had fallen.</p>
<p>The nearly 300,000 refugees are mainly Rwandan and Burundian Hutus fleeing camps in South Kivu, joined by some 10,000 Zaireans. They face epidemics and hunger unless food aid arrives in Bukavu in days.</p>
<p>High-level diplomatic efforts involving former European colonial powers, Belgium and France, and the United States are under way to try and stop fighting between the army and rebels.</p>
<p>Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, who was in Paris on Wednesday, will meet Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the conflict, officials said.</p>
<p>Zaire has appealed to the U.N. Security Council over what it termed &quot;external agression&quot; in its eastern region, state radio said.</p>
<p>Burundi and Rwanda, whose governments are both dominated by their Tutsi minorities, have denied Zairean allegations they are aiding the Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>In Bukavu, anxious soldiers set up roadblocks in case of an attack and confiscated two aid agency vehicles and beat up a Belgian aid worker. Shops were closed for a second straight day.</p>
<p>World Food Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Michelle Quintagle said the Belgian WFP staffer was beaten by four soldiers trying to take his car. They stole his cellphone, radio and documents.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of isolated incidents of insecurity,&quot; she said in Bukavu. &quot;We are told the Zairean military is requisitioning our vehicles to evacuate their families.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 150 frightened Zairean troops, militiamen and refugee camp guards fled towards Bukavu from Nyantende, 14 km (nine miles) south of Bukavu and 13 km (eight miles) north of Nyangezi town which the Banyamulenge rebels reached on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Soldiers and militiamen, looking anxious and irritable, leapt on any passing car heading towards Bukavu. One militiaman tried to steal a vehicle carrying foreign journalists.</p>
<p>Aid officials said a WFP warehouse with 49 tonnes of food at Nyantende was looted on Wednesday by refugees and possibly Zairean troops.</p>
<p>A line of 1,000 exhausted Rwandan and Burundian refugees from camps to the south straggled along the road towards Nyamiragwe camp northwest of Bukavu fearful of rebel advances.</p>
<p>Eastern Zaire has been a powderkeg since the 1994 civil war and genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda sent more than a million Hutus afraid of reprisals into the region and fuelled local rivalries.</p>
<p>Diplomats and aid officials are concerned Tutsi-dominated armies in in Burundi and Rwanda could join in the fighting.</p>
<p>They say the Tutsi successes may herald the start of Zaire's breakup with Mobutu sidelined and the army in poor morale.</p>
<p>Ruhimbika said the Banyamulenge had been joined by fighters from the Popular Revolutionary Party made up of people from Shaba and Katanga regions, the National Democratic Resistance Group made up of the Kaasai tribe and the Revolutionary Liberation Movement whose fighters are drawn from Bukavu area.</p>
<p>&quot;All these parties are grouped together under the name of the Alliance of Democratic Liberation Forces of Congo-Zaire. We will...continue our fight against the Zairean army,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Kamanyola is ours, Nyangezi is ours and Bwegera is ours. We are now pushing the Zaireans fast into Bukavu. We will carry on hitting them and anybody who sides with them until the Zairean army withdraws from the Kivu region,&quot; Ruhimbika added.</p>
<p>The Banyamulenge are an ethnic Tutsi group which came to Zaire from Rwanda as long ago as the end of the 18th century.</p>
<p>As the rebels neared Bukavu, aid agencies pulled out in two planes non-essential staff from among 100 foreign aid workers from the city, having abandoned Uvira to the south this week.</p>
<p>A diplomat said Banyamulenge aimed to empty Rwandan refugee camps in eastern Zaire and seize territory to force the Zairean government to negotiate over their claim to Zairean citizenship.</p>
<p>Aid workers in Rwanda's capital Kigali said Zaire closed a main border crossing with Rwanda on Thursday after accusing Rwandan troops of fighting alongside Tutsi rebels in the east.</p>
