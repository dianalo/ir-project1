<headline>Indian officers meet Interpol in Malaysia over gun deal case.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-02-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two Indian investigators on Saturday met Interpol officers in the Malaysian capital to seek the extradition of an Italian businessman Indian police have linked to alleged payments made by Swedish company Bofors AB in a $1.3 billion gun deal, the national Bernama news agency reported, quoting police.</p>
<p>Two officers from Indias Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Revanna Siddaiah and N.R. Wasan, had an hour-long meeting with Interpol at the Malaysian police headquarters, Bernama said, quoting a spokesman for the police legal prosecution division.</p>
<p>The CBI officers arrived in Malaysia on Friday with warrants for the arrest of Ottavio Quattrocchi and his wife, Maria, who were among five people named by Indian investigators as recipients of payments made by Bofors.</p>
<p>Quattrocchi was the representative of Italian engineering firm Snamprogetti Spa in New Delhi when India signed the gun deal with Bofors.</p>
<p>According to Bernama, the police spokesman as well as the Indian officers declined to make a comment about the discussions.</p>
<p>The spokesman was quoted as saying that Malaysia did not have an extradition treaty with India but an extradition order could be made by the court if applied for by the home minister or his deputy after referring to the Attorney-General under the Extradition Act 1992.</p>
<p>Siddaiah, when contacted at his hotel by Bernama, said, &quot;At the moment I dont want to give any comment to the media. When Im ready, then only Ill contact the media.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian police in New Delhi said on Saturday that the two investigators were in Malaysia to seek the arrest of Quattrocchi.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; S.M.Khan, a spokesman for CBI, told Reuters by telephone in response to a question on whether the CBI had a warrant to seek the Italians arrest. &quot;That (arrest) depends on the Malaysian authorities, but we will seek the arrest.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Indian investigators released the names of five people they said had received money in connection with the contract that governed the 1986 sale of Bofors field guns to the Indian government.</p>
<p>The CBI said documents obtained from Swiss authorities showed that the five had received payments from Bofors.</p>
<p>Swiss police have said there was evidence Bofors paid about $40 million into various bank accounts in Switzerland during the time the contract with India was drawn up and settled.</p>
<p>Snamprogetti and Quattrocchi on Friday denied any involvement in alleged payments by the Swedish arms maker.</p>
<p>Quattrocchi, who lives in Malaysia, released a statement in Kuala Lumpur on Friday denying any involvement with the case.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to state emphatically and unequivocally that no relationship whatsoever has ever existed at any point in time between me and Bofors and consequently between me, Bofors and India or any Indian nationals,&quot; Quattrocchi said.</p>
<p>The furore over the alleged payments contributed to the defeat in 1989 of the government of late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was accused of involvement in the affair.</p>
<p>Gandhi, who denied the allegations, was assassinated while campaigning for 1991 parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) quoted Quattrocchi as saying in a telephone interview that allegations surrounding the gun deal were aimed at damaging Gandhis image.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been a friend of Rajiv Gandhi and India. It has been a great honour for me to have known Rajiv Gandhi,&quot; the Indian news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The news agency said that Quattrocchi, asked why the CBI had named him in the case, said: &quot;It is a political campaign being carried out for the last 10 years in India. They want to damage the image of a dead man.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the PTI report in Kuala Lumpur, Quattrocchi told Reuters by telephone on Saturday: &quot;I have not spoken and I will not speak to anybody.&quot;</p>
