<headline>Italian shares close firmer, but off day's highs.</headline>
<text>
<p>1630 GMT - Milan shares ended firmer but off the day's highs as comments by Bundesbank council member Helmut Hesse added to underlying market worries about Europe's single currency starting on time, dealers said.</p>
<p>* &quot;Volumes were good today with buying activity spread across many sectors with telecoms and industrials doing particularly well, but the market had one eye on bonds and as they slipped so did stocks,&quot; said one share trader.</p>
<p>* The all-share Mibtel index closed up 0.76 percent at 12,000 after a day's high of 12,108 while the blue-chip Mib30 was up 0.69 percent at 17,768.  </p>
<p>* Bundesbank council member Helmut Hesse said in a German newspaper interview that a EMU delay would force the Maastricht Treaty to be renegotiated, while the German constitution would only allow Germany to join a stable EMU.</p>
<p>* Among individual shares, ENI ended up just 0.03 percent at 8,607 lire after Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said a third tranche of shares in the state-controlled energy group would be offered by the autumn.</p>
<p>* Among other stocks, Pirelli ended up 3.45 percent at 3,508 lire, while Montedison was 1.37 percent firmer at 1,262 lire and Olivetti gained 2.02 percent to 639.9 lire.  </p>
<p>* Telecom stocks continued their technical rebound with Telecom Italia up 4.27 percent at 4,278 lire, while TIM gained 2.24 percent to 4,435 lire and STET was 1.18 percent firmer at 7,489 lire.</p>
<p>* Ciampi said today that the share exchange rate for the merger of STET and Telecom Italia would be set soon.</p>
