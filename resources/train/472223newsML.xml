<p>A legislative measure that would help Healthdyne Technologies Inc fight off a hostile takeover by Invacare Corp was not expected to reach a second vote in the Georgia Senate, a senior member of the chamber said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The senior Democrat told Reuters the amendment and the bill to which it was attached probably would not emerge from a House-Senate committee to be appointed later in the day.</p>
<p>Even if the measure did leave the committee and passed both the House and Senate, the official added, Georgia Gov. Zell Miller had vowed privately to veto it.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for Miller said the governor had no comment about his position on the bill or the amendment.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a red herring,&quot; said the Senate official, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Thursday was expected to be the last day of the Georgia Legislature's 1997 session, with lawmakers remaining in their seats until as late as midnight.</p>
<p>The amendment, attached to a routine House bill in the Senate last week, would require publicly traded companies based in Georgia to stagger the election of directors.  </p>
<p>Senators approved the legislation by a 52-1 vote on Friday. But the House, which had already approved the bill without the amendment, disagreed with the changes on Tuesday. That sent the measure to a conference committee which still had not been appointed by late morning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the legislative advisor who authored the underlying piece of legislation, which would modify the state business code, said none of the changes need to be approved this year.  &quot;There's nothing in here that is time sensitive,&quot; said William Carney, Emory University professor of corporate finance, an advisor to the bill's sponsor, Rep. Jim Martin.</p>
