<p>Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel clashed over the issue of budget cuts for 1997 at a conference of the Israel Management Institute on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A 4.9 billion shekel cut will not be enough to realise the goals we have set in 1997,&quot; said Frenkel, stressing the need for further cuts in the coming year without specifyiny any numbers.</p>
<p>Meridor, in contrast, emphasised the political obstacles to pushing steeper cuts through parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure that everyone agrees to spending cuts,&quot; he said. &quot;The real test by decision makers is not in theory but in implementation.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not speak of any additional cuts beyond the 4.9 billion already approved by the cabinet and to be presented to parliament next week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, reiterated that 4.9 billion shekels -- equal to 3.2 percent of spending next year -- would not be sufficient.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very big reduction but it's not enough.&quot; he said, adding there would be &quot;wider and harder cuts&quot;.</p>
<p>Further cuts, however, are not expected before parliament approves the 4.9 billion shekel cut, which it has until the end of the year to do.</p>
<p>Meridor attacked the central bank's tight monetary policy and said it had to be less focussed on just inflation. &quot;Every element of policy, whether it is the budget, monetary policy or reform influences everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Defending his hardline policy Frenkel hinted that an expected slowdown in the economy would not soften his stand on interest rates.</p>
<p>He said the Bank of Israel would not adjust its goals to deal with problems such as unemployment as its main goal was to fight inflation.</p>
<p>Frenkel will announce interest rates for November next week. The key lending rate now stands at an annual 15.5 percent while inflation is running at a rate of 11 percent. Netanyahu himself has called for a reduction in interest rates.</p>
<p>Meridor also discounted the connection between economic growth and peace, saying: &quot;Is peace a necessary condition for growth -- No.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that during the 1991 Gulf War the Israeli economy grew very quickly.</p>
