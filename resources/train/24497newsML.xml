<p>India on Friday said it would not block a U.N. General Assembly debate on a nuclear weapons test ban treaty but put the United Nations on notice it would insist on a two-thirds majority vote for any action.</p>
<p>India's U.N. ambassador Prakash Shah also told a news conference he would argue that taking a vote was illegal because the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament had not approved the treaty, as the assembly had asked last year.</p>
<p>Australia has called a meeting of the 185-member General Assembly for Sept. 9 to have it adopt the draft treaty and open it for signature by individual states.</p>
<p>After nearly three years of negotiations for a landmark Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, India this month refused to endorse the text by the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament because nuclear weapons states made no move to give up their arsenals. That kept the entire treaty in limbo since decisions at the conference have to be unanimous.</p>
<p>There is a dispute about whether the General Assembly needs a simple majority or a two-thirds vote, but diplomats in favour of the treaty said they expected to get the two-thirds majority in any case.</p>
<p>India, however, is counting on developing nations, only 29 of which were represented in Geneva, to support its position.</p>
<p>The treaty cannot go into force until 44 nations with nuclear capabilities sign and ratify it. But states like Australia believe the commitment to stop testing would begin as soon as the treaty was open for signature and India would come under pressure to sign it.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now faced with attempts to circumvent the decision of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva by a procedural manoeuvre,&quot; Shah told reporters. &quot;If we all believe that the treaty is such an important issue, Article 18 should apply,&quot; he said, referring to a U.N. Charter article that important questions need a two-thirds majority of members voting.</p>
<p>Shah said India did not approve the treaty because it did not lead to elimination of nuclear weapons, did not cover all kinds of nuclear testing and allowed the five acknowledged nuclear weapons powers to continue developing and improving the quality of their atomic arms.</p>
<p>He called the draft a &quot;flawed document&quot; and said it failed to meet the mandate given by the General Assembly as well as the Non-Aligned Movement and therefore could not be considered a first step towards nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p>Shah also vigorously denied that India opposed the treaty because it did not want to stop its nuclear weapons programme, saying the nuclear powers would not give the slimmest commitment to work towards eliminating these arms.</p>
<p>Australia's U.N. ambassador, Richard Butler, earlier said he agreed with many of the criticisms India raised because &quot;it is right to want progress in nuclear disarmament.&quot; But he said since 1945 there had been 530 nuclear tests, many in the atmosphere, so states could develop ever more sophisticated arms. Therefore commitments to stop testing were tantamount to a moratorium on developing new and different nuclear bombs.</p>
