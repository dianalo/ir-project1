<p>Rising U.S. stock prices now pose a downside risk to the economy and it would not be a surprise to see a drop in the Dow Industrials of up to 10 percent anytime now, Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve vice chairman, said told Reuters Financial Television in an interview on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;It wouldn't be a big surprise any day, any week, to see a substantial drop,&quot; Blinder said, adding that the Dow could fall several hundred points, or between five and 10 percent.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials set a new closing high on Thursday, finishing 38 points or 0.57 percent higher at 6,765.</p>
<p>But Blinder said stock prices had been resilient and their strength had had a positive effect.</p>
<p>&quot;For a long time, it was a positive factor by lowering the cost of capital for businesses and creating consumer wealth. It is still doing that, but now it's created a certain amount of downside risk,&quot; he said.</p>
