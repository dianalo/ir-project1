<p>NYMEX electricity futures fell in a retracement from last week's run-up amid moderate weather in much of the U.S. West, market sources said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was pretty boring. We saw a retracement off of low volume,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Barring a significant pick-up in natural gas prices, which could happen if gas is drawn up amid the heatwave afflicting the East Coast, the NYMEX electricity complex may remain rangebound this week, he added.</p>
<p>The July California Oregon Border (COB) contract settled down $1.16 per megawatt hour (MWh) at $20.34 following trade at $20.25-$20.80.</p>
<p>August COB ended 82 cents lower at $23.19 per MWh, while September settled down 50 cents at $23.00.</p>
<p>July Palo Verde (PV) closed down $1.19 at $32.71, after trading between $32.40 and $33.00.</p>
<p>August PV lost $1.16 to settle at $33.90, while September PV fell 70 cents to settle at $28.80.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Southwest were forecast to average between zero and five degrees F below normal through mid-week, rising to near normal to above normal by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Northwest temperatures were forecast at four to eight degrees below normal through mid-week, rising to above normal by next week.</p>
<p>The NYMEX July Henry Hub natural gas contract gained 1.1 cents to settle at $2.246 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Separately, the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) committee last week recommended a the Pacific Intertie transmission system be derated from July 1-30 to 6,300 MW from the current limit of 7,200 MW.</p>
<p>The WSCC board is expected to approve the plan this week.</p>
<p>As of 1535 PDT, NYMEX estimated 400 COB and 442 PV contractswere traded.</p>
