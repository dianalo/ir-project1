<p>Israeli bonds closed higher on Tuesday ahead of the publication of the June consumer price index at the end of the trading day, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.08 pct to 109.73</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.11 pct to 109.51</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: +0.05 pct to 109.84</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.02 pct to 111.34</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.03 pct to 107.84</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was a low 130 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the market was waiting for the CPI,&quot; said Ronen Elgali of United Mizrahi Bank.</p>
<p>The June CPI, published after the close of trading, rose by an unexpectedly high 1.1 percent against a rise of 0.5 percent in May. The inflation was due mainly to housing prices, which went up 2.4 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.</p>
<p>Housing prices, which are a major component of the index, accounted for 0.6 percentage point of the June increase.</p>
<p>The June index boosted inflation for the first six months of the year to about five percent, which would put annualised inflation slightly over the government's target of seven to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Adam Reuter of the Financial Immunities consulting firm, predicted traders would bail out of unlinked bonds on Wednesday in response to the high CPI and move into inflation-linked bonds.</p>
<p>He added that the central Bank of Israel may raise interest rates at the end of the month because June is traditionally a low-inflation month.</p>
<p>Elgali said demand was strong on Tuesday both for CPI-linked and unlinked bonds because the market was divided about the inflation outlook in the coming months.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe inflation is on its way down, and will be around 8.0-8.5 percent in the coming 12 months. At these levels the yields on unlinked bonds are quite good,&quot; Elgali said.</p>
<p>Those buying CPI-linked bonds were expecting real interest rates to fall in the medium and long term and antiticpating a decline in government debt issues, a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is simply no merchandise in the market. The government is cuttng its budget, keeping its budget deficit target and issuing even fewer bonds than expected because it has income from privatisations,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Dollar-linked bonds were stable with a negative trend, traders said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
