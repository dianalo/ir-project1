<p>Governor Chris Patten said on Thursday Britain was handing over Hong Kong to communist China this month in sound condition and Beijing need not fear recent democratic reforms.</p>
<p>Patten, the 28th and last governor of this wealthy colony, displayed his rapier wit and diplomatic skills in a final appearance before the colonial legislature.</p>
<p>While Patten was saying his farewells ahead of the June 30 handover, closing the chapter on more than 150 years of British rule, future leader Tung Chee-hwa was swinging into the spirit of the handover celebrations.</p>
<p>Tung, once a shipping magnate and Beijing's choice to run the passionate capitalist outpost, welcomed a specially painted jumbo jet to mark the approaching era of Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Lion-dancers cavorted around the Cathay Pacific plane and Tung ceremonially dotted their eyes to wish them luck.</p>
<p>Some 4,000 official guests from around the world will attend the midnight ceremony when Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, formally turns over Hong Kong to Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>China has called the elaborate festivities, with endless parties and two giant fireworks displays, the media event of the century. Some 8,000 journalists are expected to attend.</p>
<p>But Patten stole the show on Thursday with his shining performance before the colonial legislature, which will soon be replaced by a pro-Beijing assembly.</p>
<p>Asked about his biggest regret, Patten said he wished he could have convinced Beijing that Hong Kong and its people posed no threat.</p>
<p>He would have liked Beijing leaders to appreciate &quot;that there was nothing to worry about in Hong Kong&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>Patten provoked the wrath of China by introducing limited democratic reforms in the twilight of colonial rule.</p>
<p>Of those reforms, he said that it &quot;wasn't a question of planting British time bombs around the community but that it was a matter of reflecting the aspirations of the community&quot;.</p>
<p>Britain and China set the terms in 1984 for Hong Kong's return but in the final years before the agreed date they have become bogged down in endless disputes.</p>
<p>China has sought to reassure Hong Kong's 6.4 million residents that they have nothing to fear under Beijing's &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy.</p>
<p>Under the Sino-British agreement, Hong Kong will keep its no-holds-barred capitalist system for 50 years but concerns remain that Beijing will slowly close its grasp on the territory.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said China's policies would not &quot;infringe&quot; on Hong Kong but added that he hoped nothing would happen in Hong Kong to &quot;infringe&quot; on China's national interests.</p>
<p>&quot;The central government's policies will not infringe upon the interests of Hong Kong,&quot; he said in a speech.</p>
<p>&quot;We also hope things will not emerge in Hong Kong that will infringe upon Hong Kong's and the national interests,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>China's concerns are focused on a pro-democracy movement which has kept up an active campaign against Tung's decisions to trim Patten's democratic reforms.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy leaders have pushed their protests in the countdown to the handover and vowed to occupy the colonial legislature during the ceremonies -- a gesture of defiance to the new Tung government.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and China signed an accord on Thursday formally demarcating their border in preparation for the handover.</p>
<p>Although China is reasserting control over Hong Kong, it plans to keep the territory separate from the rest of the country as a highly autonomous capitalist region.</p>
