<headline>FOCUS-Euro stocks down on Dow's open, still nervous.</headline>

<p>European stock markets were down but off their lows on Friday despite Wall Street falling once more on nervousness prompted by U.S. Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan's warning this week about interest rates.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks fell more than 50 points in New York trading with investors still wary of Greenspan's comments on Wednesday that a U.S. interest rate rise might be needed to nip inflation in the bud.</p>
<p>The dollar recovered against the mark in Europe after a mild slip on the announcement of a downward revision in 1996 U.S. gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>But traders said a market-friendly revision of fourth quarter gross domestic product data was not enough to cheer bonds or stocks.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt the 30-share DAX index eased from Thursday's record high as poor overnight performances in Japan and the United States combined with speculation over a delay in the launch of European economic and monetary union (EMU) to exert pressure on the market.</p>
<p>The German Bundesbank and Finance Ministry put the brakes on a rapid slide after denying a market rumour that Germany was about to issue a statement saying EMU would be delayed.</p>
<p>&quot;The EMU issue should be over for the moment but it hasn't stopped people taking profits today. But there is still more upside in this market and we should see that next week,&quot; a dealer at a Bavarian bank said.</p>
<p>Thursday's 0.83 percent drop on Wall Street helped prompt the London stock market, Europe's busiest, to fall around three-quarters of a percentage point in morning trading, but it edged up again slightly after Wall Street opened.</p>
<p>Sterling dipped initially after the ruling Conservative Party suffered a crushing defeat in a parliamentary by-election in Britain.</p>
<p>The markets had expected the opposition Labour Party to win the poll -- and the general election due by May -- and analysts said any downward move for the pound should be temporary.</p>
<p>&quot;The effect of the by-election should not have a large impact because the unpopularity of the current government is hardly a surprise,&quot; said Klaus Baader, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>Markets, traditionally pro-Conservative, have seen the prospect of a Labour government as a bearish influence. Although the FTSE 100 share index fell during the morning, dealers said a weak Dow was behind the move and the by-election result had little impact.</p>
<p>Analysts said markets should be relieved that a decisive victory in the by-election could allay fears of uncertainty or a possible hung parliament after the general election.</p>
<p>French shares closed with a sharp loss, affected by the renewed slide in New York and profit-taking on the expiry of February futures.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index ended up 21.85 points, or 0.83 percent, at 2,607.55, while the CAC-40 March futures contract was down at 2,625 from 2,640 on Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Renault closed 13 percent higher at 146.90 francs after it announced the closure of its Belgian plant on Thursday.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1600 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6887 marks and 120.74 yen, compared with 1.6892 and 120.70 in late European trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sterling traded around 2.7520 marks and $1.6312 versus 2.7484 and $1.6266 overnight.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1600 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 27.2 points at 4,312.0.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 ended down 21.85 points, or 0.83 percent, at 2,607.55.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index ended bourse floor trade 17.08 points lower at 3,259.64. In later screenn-based trade, the IBIS DAX was down 11.54 at 3,2621.04</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $358.60, down $2 after being hit by profit-taking which affected platinum as well. Silver was barely changed, adding one cent to reach $5.26. Platinum was fixed up $2.00 at $388.50, but off its earlier high of $406.00 on profit-taking.</p>
