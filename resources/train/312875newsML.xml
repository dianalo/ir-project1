<title>UK: British Conservative MP dies, Major in minority.</title>
<headline>British Conservative MP dies, Major in minority.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Iain Mills, a member of parliament for Britain's ruling Conservative Party, has died, the Press Association news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>His death means Prime Minister John Major is clearly in a minority in parliament as the Conservatives have 322 MPs and the combined opposition have 323. Mills, MP for Meriden in central England, had a 14,699 majority at the 1992 election.  </p>
<p>An election must be held by May 22 but Major may have to call a snap poll if he is defeated in parliament.</p>
<p>Major has hinted he wants to hold out until May before calling an election as he hopes improved economic conditions will persuade voters to re-elect the Conservatives.</p>
<p>The main opposition Labour party leads in opinion polls by about 20 points. A parliamentary by-election is already pending in north-west England following the death of another Conservative MP.</p>
