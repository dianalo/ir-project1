<title>MEXICO: Mexico peso closes stable on inflation hopes.</title>
<headline>Mexico peso closes stable on inflation hopes.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>The Mexican peso reversed its earlier weakness to close moderately firmer on Monday due to an inflow of dollars amid favorable market expectations for forthcoming inflation data, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso opened very weak and that is when local banks and some foreign ones began to sell dollars,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate ended 0.25 and 0.3 firmer, respectively, at 7.9780/7.9825 and 7.9750/7.9800 per dollar.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico was expected to announce May inflation data shortly after the close of trade.  </p>
<p>Ten financial firms surveyed by Reuters MEX22 forecast an average increase of 0.92 percent in the Consumer Price Index for May.</p>
<p>This would be the first time since the peso crisis of Decmber 1994 that consumer prices had risen by less than one percent in a month.</p>
<p>Dealers said the peso also held firm on market forecasts of an increase in primary interest rates at Tuesday's central bank auction of government securities, for which reason they expected the peso to remain stable on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the peso could trade in a similar range to today's session,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had closed earlier 0.65 of a centavo weaker at 7.9760/7.9790 per dollar.</p>
