<p>Flash floods in Jordan's southern deserts may have washed away British dreams of breaking the world land speed record this year.</p>
<p>Members of the Thrust Supersonic team testing their 9.5 tonne jet-powered car on the mud-flats of al-Jafr, 125 miles (200 km) south of Amman, said on Wednesday it had to be rushed to shelter after heavy rain turned the desert into a lake.</p>
<p>&quot;We had to beat a hasty retreat,&quot; said Andrew Noble, whose brother Richard is leading the assault on his own world record of 633.47 mph (1,019.44 kph).</p>
<p>Noble said the team still hoped their 10 mile (16 km) test track may have avoided the worst of the flooding.</p>
<p>But no test runs would be possible before next week and the team would have to revise their plans to make Thrust SSC, powered by twin jet engines from a Phantom warplane, the fastest machine in the world on four wheels.</p>
<p>&quot;Any more runs we do here are likely to be development runs rather than record attempts,&quot; Noble told Reuters by telephone from al-Jafr.</p>
<p>The team had planned to reach 650 mph (1,040 kph) in Jordan this year in preparation for an even more ambitious target next year -- breaking the sound barrier (about 750 mph/1,200 kph) in the deserts of Nevada in the United States.</p>
<p>So far the car, designed to reach up to 850 mph (1,360 kph) has not gone beyond a sedate 300 mph (480 kph).</p>
<p>&quot;There is a possibility of coming back to Jordan next spring,&quot; Noble said, adding that he had been scouting around for other sites in the kingdom which could meet the team's needs.</p>
<p>One possible strip, near the border with Iraq, turned out to be &quot;an excellent surface&quot; but at just five miles (eight km) long, it was far too short for the car to reach its top speeds and slow down again, even with parachute brakes.</p>
<p>Another 14 mile strip at al-Jafr would need weeks of clearing before it would be ready.</p>
<p>Noble said financial restraints meant the team could not stay in Jordan much more than another two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We're sitting here, hoping the weather will dry things out for us,&quot; he said.</p>
