<p>Zambia expects a budget surplus in 1997, banking on a resumption of aid flows from Western donors despite criticism of recent elections, Finance Minister Ronald Penza said in his national budget speech on Friday.</p>
<p>Contrary to analysts' expectations, the government cut value added tax, said it would maintain social sector spending and declared itself on course for a surplus of revenue over expenditure.</p>
<p>Penza said he expected a 5.5 percent growth in real gross domestic product in 1997, compared to 6.4 percent growth in 1996.</p>
<p>He said the government planned to have 1,489.1 billion kwacha ($1.1 billion) in revenue against projected expenditure of 1,427.1 billion kwacha.</p>
<p>&quot;About two thirds of total expenditure will be financed from internal financial resources,&quot; he said, adding that foreign aid would account for 488.9 billion kwacha.</p>
<p>Of the donor component, 358.9 billion kwacha will be project support and 130 billion non-project support.</p>
<p>Penza said preliminary indications were that Zambia would need around $200 million in balance of payment support and about $275 million in project financing.</p>
<p>The intended budget surplus would be used to pay the government's domestic debts, he said.</p>
<p>Western donors cut aid to Zambia last year after constitutional amendments by President Frederick Chiluba barred his main opponents from contesting a general election which he later won in a landslide.</p>
<p>Penza said he expected inflation to drop to 15 percent by the end of the year from 35 percent recorded at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, government spending will be focused on those areas that support growth. In this regard, it will be necessary to run an overall budget surplus of about one percent of GDP,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given our commitment to promoting private sector led growth ...I have reduced VAT to 17.5 percent. This measure will be with effect from July 1, 1997, in keeping with the VAT year,&quot; Penza said. The VAT is currently 20 percent.</p>
<p>Despite aid cuts, Zambia's balance of payments improved in 1996, but remained in deficit at $118 million for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Preliminary estimates on the balance of payments indicate that the overall balance improved from a deficit of $261.4 million in 1995 to $118 million in 1996,&quot; Penza said.</p>
