<p>India will raise the prices of petroleum products by month-end, and the increase will be &quot;almost negligible,&quot; the Economic Times on Wednesday quoted Petroleum Minister Janeshwar Mishra as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil price hike will be a painless surgery and the decision will be taken by the month-end,&quot; the daily quoted Mishra as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil companies have already met me and expressed their inability to continue importing crude unless some corrective steps are taken soon,&quot; Mishra said.</p>
<p>India's ruling United Front coalition has for months been divided over how to control a mounting oil subsidy bill. On Monday, it postponed until June 27 a decision on whether to raise petroleum product prices.</p>
<p>The oil pool account deficit, representing money the government owes domestic oil firms to compensate them for selling some petroleum products at below global prices, stood at 155 billion rupees ($4.3 billion) at the end of March.</p>
<p>The leftwing parties in Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's coalition have repeatedly opposed raising the prices of some petroleum products such as kerosene and diesel to plug the government's mounting debt to state oil companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The Left parties are our partners and we will have to discuss the issue in greater detail,&quot; the Economic Times quoted Mishra as saying. &quot;We will go in for the middle path and the hike will be almost negligible.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the government planned to hold informal talks with leftwing parties, but did not elaborate. Mishra said the Petroleum Ministry, Finance Ministry and Planning Commission were already holding discussions.</p>
<p>The Economic Times said Mishra's comments suggested that the government planned to freeze the oil pool account deficit at its current level, instead of bridging it with a steep 25 percent increase in petroleum product prices across the board.</p>
<p>A gradual price increase would mean that oil firms would be forced to absorb their losses, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Mishra said the government was not considering reducing customs and excise duties on petroleum products -- a suggestion proposed by the coalition's leftwing parties, who say a rise in oil prices will hurt the poor.</p>
