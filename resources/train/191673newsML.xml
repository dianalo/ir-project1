<title>UK: U.S. data boosts Wall St, European bourses.</title>
<headline>U.S. data boosts Wall St, European bourses.</headline>

<p>Fresh economic data showing that the powerhouse U.S. economy is steadily slowing -- implying U.S. interest rates might stay low -- boosted both record-breaking Wall Street and European stocks on Friday.</p>
<p>Leading European shares, which had opened significantly firmer boosted by a seventh consecutive record close on Wall Street overnight, all closed well up.</p>
<p>The Dow had surged 50 points or 0.8 percent by the time European markets closed after news from the Federal Reserve that the United States had suffered its first decline in industrial output in seven months.</p>
<p>U.S. October industrial production showed a surprise 0.5 percent drop, confounding expectations of a 0.2 rise, after September's 0.3 growth.</p>
<p>The news of a slowing economy means a U.S. rate hike is less likely which is good news for stocks. The converse should be true for the dollar and it did drift down against the yen throughout the afternoon and was unsettled against the mark.</p>
<p>But analysts said the U.S. currency's weakness against the yen was more connected with nerves about Japanese economic growth -- Japanese trade data for October was due at 2350 GMT, and was expected to show the surplus declining at a slower pace or even rising for the first time in 23 months.</p>
<p>They said they actually regarded the U.S. data as ambivalent, shedding little light on the near-term prospects for U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There's so much mixed data coming out that I don't think anyone's prepared to take a strong view on the U.S. economy at this stage,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase.</p>
<p>In London, Europe biggest bourse, leading shares managed to shake off domestic interest rate worries to close near the week's highest levels, taking their lead from New York and from from sharply higher government bonds.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index closed 32.1 points higher at 3,958.2, leaving it up 47.4 points on the week.</p>
<p>A heavy flow of results from major companies should provide the focus of attention for London equities next week, with eight firms in the FTSE due to report in the next five trading sessions.</p>
<p>But analysts said the market remained vulnerable to further inflationary signs which would strengthen fears British rates may have to be raised again in the near future.</p>
<p>German shares ended bourse trade at another record and the market was looking forward to the giant Deutsche Telekom flotation on Monday. In later computerised trade the IBIS DAX index reached a fresh record.</p>
<p>There was heavy trade in major German banks Deutsche, Dresdner, and Commerzbank in the light of takeover and merger rumours.</p>
<p>In Paris French shares hit a fresh closing high on the back of bullish Wall Street.</p>
<p>Friday's gains would have been bigger but for a 10 point index fall just before the close and traders said that there could be further profit-taking next week.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 22.15 points or one percent at 2,240.33. It earlier hit a trading high of 2,250.29.</p>
<p>A major focus of the currency markets was the pound sterling which powered ahead to a four-year high of $1.6697 against the dollar and a 30-month high of 2.5180 against the mark.</p>
<p>The pound's latest sharp rise began on Wednesday after the minutes of the September monetary meeting between Bank of England governor Eddie George and Clarke showed that George had urged the government to raise rates to more six percent.</p>
<p>However, analysts warned sterling's rise could be short-lived and the prospect of a disappointing budget and low November inflation figures could be lying in wait to ambush it.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1700 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5090 marks and 111.17 yen compared with 1.5096 marks and 111.31 yen late in Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS CLOSING INDICES</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 32.1 points higher at 3,958.2.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished up 22.15 at 2,240.33.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 18.79 at 2,795.80.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold ended considerably weaker at $379.75 an ounce, down from 382.50 at the London close on Thursday.</p>
