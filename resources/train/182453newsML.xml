<headline>China court again calls off dissidents' trial.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>A court in southern China on Tuesday postponed for a second day the trial of two dissidents accused of the capital crime of plotting to overthrow the government, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reported.</p>
<p>Labour activists Li Wenming and Guo Baosheng, arrested in May 1994 for starting an independent labour union, also stand accused of spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda, RTHK said.</p>
<p>It was the second time the trial in Shenzhen, in southern Guangdong province near Hong Kong, had been postponed. Prosecutors said they were unable to start the trial on Monday because the court was fully booked.</p>
<p>Prosecutors told reporters on Tuesday the delay was because the judge was ill, but a human rights group said it was due to unwelcome attention from Hong Kong media.</p>
<p>&quot;A spokesman for the Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China...said he believed it was caused by too many reporters in court,&quot; RTHK said.</p>
<p>It was unclear when the trial would open.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have said the two dissidents could face harsher sentences than that given to former student leader Wang Dan.</p>
<p>Wang was given a 11-year sentence in October for plotting to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Exiled Chinese dissident Han Dongfang told reporters in Hong Kong that appeals on behalf of Li, a former worker with a Shenzhen magazine, and Guo, a philosophy student in Beijing, had been made to international labour organisations.</p>
<p>Han also urged the Chinese government to be lenient.</p>
