<p>Unusually warm weather drove U.S. demand for refined petroleum products down 1.5 percent in February from a year ago to 18.22 million barrels per day, the American Petroleum Institute said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in demand, imports were up 13 percent from a year ago, with &quot;substantially smaller draws on domestic inventories this February than in early 1996,&quot; API said in its monthly statistical report.</p>
<p>At 7.41 million bpd, crude oil imports in February were at their highest since October and up 13 percent from a year ago. Product imports of 1.98 million bpd were up 14 percent.</p>
<p>Although companies were relying more on imports, gasoline inventories in February fell 5.4 percent from a year ago to 201.9 million barrels, &quot;the lowest for that time of the year in several decades,&quot; API said. API officials were unable to be more precise for this data.</p>
<p>February was the third straight month in which oil demand was flat or down from the same month in 1995, thanks to weather that was 13 percent warmer nationwide than in February 1995, and even milder in the heating oil-dependent Northeast.</p>
<p>As a result, deliveries of distillate, including heating oil and diesel, fell 5.4 percent to 3.52 million bpd.  </p>
<p>Deliveries of jet kerosene, often blended with diesel and heating oil for winter conditions, dropped by 5 percent to 1.58 million bpd.</p>
<p>Demand for residual fuel shrank 7.7 percent to 949,000 bpd in February from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p>Gasoline demand rose 0.3 percent to 7.57 million bpd over the same period.</p>
<p>Much of the jump in product imports was in gasoline blending components and unfinished oils.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports of gasoline blending components have surged since early last fall, at least in part a reflection of the importation of gasoline into the East Coast for blending up to reformulated specifications,&quot; API said.</p>
<p>U.S. production of crude and condensate was off 1.0 percent from February a year ago to 6.45 million bpd.</p>
<p>Crude oil stocks were off 0.9 percent from a year ago to 298.9 million barrels.</p>
<p>With the mild winter compared to last year, distillate stocks jumped 10.2 percent to 106.7 million barrels at the end of February.</p>
