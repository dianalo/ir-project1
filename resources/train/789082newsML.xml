<headline>Toronto stocks post third straight record close.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks posted another record close on Thursday, ignoring heavy losses on Wall Street as Canadian equities extended their rally to three days.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index gained 11.37 points to finish at 6945.07. The Dow Jones Average lost 71 points on Thursday.</p>
<p>The key 300 index also set an intraday peak of 6964.08.</p>
<p>Investors were busy with over 97 million shares traded worth C$1.6 billion ($1.1 billion).</p>
<p>Strong gains in precious metals, consumer products and communications led nine of 14 sectors higher. The weak side included conglomerates, transport and financial services.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors will be closely watching Friday's July employment report in Canada.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of economists predicted employment would grow by 35,500 in July after an increase of 52,000 in June. The same survey said Canada's unemployment rate would remain unchanged at 9.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid that another strong report on job creation may mean an impending move by the Bank of Canada,&quot; Jeoffrey Hall, managing analyst with Technical Data, said in a report.</p>
