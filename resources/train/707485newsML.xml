<p>Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui said on Friday Taipei would seek to negotiate with Tokyo to resolve a sovereignty dispute over a Japan-held East China Sea archipelago.</p>
<p>State television said Lee was deeply concerned by a continuing row over the islands, known in Chinese as the Diaoyus and in Japanese as the Senkakus.</p>
<p>Lee told a group of fishermen that the uninhabited islands, held by Japan but claimed by both Taiwan and China, had been a traditional fishing ground for Taiwan.</p>
<p>The government would seek to negotiate with Japan to protect fishermen's rights, he said.</p>
<p>The president's comments came three days after the latest, but failed, bid by Chinese nationalists from Taiwan to reach the archipelago. They were thwarted after a skirmish with Japanese patrols intent on defending Tokyo's claim of sovereignty.</p>
<p>The island chain has ignited fiery nationalist passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan since a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse there in July 1996, a move they said bolstered Japan's sovereignty.</p>
<p>China says the uninhabited islets have been Chinese territory for centuries while Japan's claim dates to 1894.</p>
<p>The islands' waters are rich in fish, but experts have said there is no evidence that they hold significant oil deposits.</p>
