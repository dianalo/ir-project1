<p>Any capital gains tax cut enacted this year would affect profits on sales of stocks and other assets as of May 7, the chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to propose that the effective date for any capital gains tax cut included in the budget reconciliation bill will be with respect to sales and exchanges occurring on or after today,&quot; according to a joint statement from House Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer of Texas and Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth of Delaware.  </p>
<p>A capital gains tax cut is expected to be part of a tax package this year and was included in a broad outline of a budget agreement reached Friday between congressional leaders and the White House.</p>
<p>Specific details of any tax cut package have yet to be worked out. But the agreement called for $85 billion in net tax cuts over five years.</p>
<p>Republicans have said a tax cut on profits made on investments is one of their priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Interested parties should be advised that no specific provisions have been agreed upon and will only be finalised at the end of the legislative process,&quot; the joint statement said.</p>
<p>Currently, the maximum capital gains tax rate is 28 percent, and analysts have predicted it could be reduced to 19.8 percent to 21 percent.</p>
