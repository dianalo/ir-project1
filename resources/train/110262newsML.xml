<headline>IPE Brent ends up 40 cts in late shortcovering.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent futures made a sound recovery on Friday in a day of consolidation after Thursday's heavy profit-taking slump.</p>
<p>November Brent last traded up 40 cents at $24.00 a barrel, recovering a good chunk of the dollar-plus slide from Tuesday's $24.60 post Gulf War high.</p>
<p>Shortcovering in market-on-close buying was worth half the day's gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Today was mostly a day just to take stock of market conditions and consolidate, but we had some short-covering there at the close,&quot; said an IPE broker.  </p>
<p>&quot;The bull run is by no means over but some of the froth is off the top.&quot;</p>
<p>Technical analysts said Thursday's 67 cent slide, led by a $13.75 per cent or five per cent slump in gas oil, had left charts in shape for the possibility of another move higher.</p>
<p>Overbought conditions on short term relative strength indices had been wiped out, they said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fundamentals for gas oil still were likely to provide a solid prop for markets given primary stocks in the U.S. and Europe some 10-11 percent below year ago levels, dealer said.  </p>
<p>There was some concern among traders that key German household, or tertiary, heating oil stocks were on the mend but northwest European physical markets saw higher premiums for diesel on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Diesel in France, Germany, and the UK is incredibly tight and there are no stocks at all,&quot; said a British trading manager.</p>
<p>Diesel barge premiums rose to trade atlus $35.50 fob ARA for winter grade.</p>
<p>IPE gas oil for November ended up $2 a tonne at $227.</p>
