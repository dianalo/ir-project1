<p>Atlanta Hawks basketball star Mookie Blaylock was charged with possession of marijuana after a police dog detected the drug when the player went through U.S. customs at Vancouver airport, Canadian police confirmed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the National Basketball Association forward was charged with possession of about 2 ounces (56 grams) of marijuana on Feb. 1.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a complete gentleman and no trouble at all,&quot; said Sgt. Bill Twidale, of the Mounties' airport drug squad.</p>
<p>Blaylock, who was boarding a plane for Phoenix, was allowed to leave the country but was ordered to return to Canada for a court appearance on May 14.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Atlanta Hawks team declined comment on the arrest.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Thursday that the arrest occurred a week before his probation was to expire on an earlier marijuana charge.</p>
<p>Blaylock was charged in 1995 with possession and drinking and driving by Cobb County police after he was stopped for speeding. He was placed on a year's probation, which expired on Feb. 8, 1997.</p>
<p>Cobb County officials said there probably would not be any repercussions for Blaylock because they did not find out about the Canadian arrest before the probation expired, the newspaper reported.</p>
