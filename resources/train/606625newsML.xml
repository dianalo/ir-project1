<p>A senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official said he would like to see a yen version of the dollar-based currency safety net pact between Asian monetary authorities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to see this happen as soon as possible,&quot; Takashi Anzai, executive director of the BOJ, told Reuters Financial Television in an interview broadcast on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last year, Japan agreed with the monetary authorities of Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand to establish bilateral repurchase agreements to provide liquidity in times of currency crisis.  </p>
<p>These &quot;repo&quot; pacts give participants instant access to cash -- in order to defend their currencies against excessive volatility -- by virtue of them selling their holdings in U.S. government securities to partners with a promise to buy them back later.</p>
<p>The BOJ has been considering the possibility of a repo pact based on yen-denominated assets for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;With regard to the liquidity of the yen, this is the reponsibility of the BOJ. And what we want to do in this case is respond as closely as possible to the needs of Asian countries,&quot; Anzai said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe this is a service the central bank can provide,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A different BOJ official told Reuters last week that Japan's central bank might join other Asian central banks to support the weak Thai baht if asked by Thailand as part of the repo pact.</p>
<p>Although several Asian central banks intervened jointly then to defend the baht, the repo pact was apparently not used.</p>
<p>Anzai said: &quot;It's a question of liquidity. If the dollar-repos were not used in this case, it must have been that there wasn't the need for them to be used.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;There is very close contact between Japan and Asian monetary authorities, and an exchange of views on Asian market conditions. And we have discussed a number of steps to react to market turbulence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But when asked why it was never made clear whether the BOJ had intervened to support the baht last week or not, he said he could not comment on specific policies.</p>
