<p>Istanbul shares rose an average 1.7 percent in hectic trade on Wednesday as a medium-term uptrend continued with the market testing new resistance at the index's 72,000 level, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed 1,204.48 points higher at 72,051.24, a new two-month high after Tuesday. The previous highest close was 72,758.08 on July 11.</p>
<p>It had leapt 2.4 percent yesterday after Monday's minor correction that followed last week's 7.3 percent surge.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some selling today, but the market still looked good with the help of selective activity. It may try 73,000 levels tomorrow,&quot; said Huseyin Istanbullu from Meksa securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said activity again focused on shares of utilities and largely state owned firms which strongly move the market index with their large market capitalisations.</p>
<p>Trade volume jumped to 13.6 trillion lira ($150 million) from Tuesday's 12.4 trillion ($136.5 million).</p>
