<p>DeeDee Jonrowe was never a threat for this year's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race title, but her pre-dawn, fourth-place finish in Nome Wednesday was a triumph nonetheless.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm here, and I'm happy to be here,&quot; a bubbly Jonrowe said as she greeted well-wishers at the finish line of the grueling, 1,161-mile race from Anchorage.</p>
<p>Four months earlier she had been lying in the intensive care unit of a Fairbanks hospital, the victim of a horrific auto accident that left her with debilitating injuries, nearly crippled her husband and killed her step-grandmother.</p>
<p>Behind a lead dog named Job, Jonrowe ran the race with a ripped rotator cuff that eliminated use of her left arm and a missing piece of her intestine removed by surgeons after the auto wreck. She also had suffered a long convalesence that robbed her of training time and sapped her endurance.</p>
<p>That was her Wednesday morning, said Jonrowe, a 43-year-old musher from Willow, Alaska, who has been in the top 10 in every Iditarod since 1988 and is now the top woman in long-distance sled-dog racing.</p>
<p>&quot;Four months ago it didn't look quite so promising. But, you know, I had already made the decision four months ago that I was not taking the winter off. I had people try to talk me into taking the winter off, and I knew that wasn't a good thing to do,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Even those closest to her wondered whether she could finish this year's Iditarod, or if she should even enter the race.</p>
<p>&quot;I had serious doubts,&quot; said Peg Stout, Jonrowe's mother. &quot;I think she felt the same way. She was not sure of herself.&quot;</p>
<p>Jonrowe, in fact, admitted that she considered quitting about a third of the way through the race, after a bad stretch in which she had dropped several of her dogs. But she gained speed and confidence as she headed for the Yukon River, she said.</p>
<p>Running behind the lead pack of Martin Buser, Doug Swingley and Jeff King, Jonrowe said she had time for contemplation along the route. She also found herself weeping and praying as she travelled alone through the wilderness.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of it was cleansing,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>King, a two-time champion who finished in third place and about three hours before Jonrowe, praised his fellow musher when he arrived in Nome early Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to pay tribute to someone who's that inspirational,&quot; King said. &quot;She is really something special, there's no doubt about it.&quot;</p>
<p>King and other mushers came to Jonrowe's aid after the accident.</p>
<p>Fellow Iditarod competitor Bill Cotter, for example, rushed to the wreck scene to comfort her while aid workers extracated her from the car. Sprint-racing champion Roxy Wright-Champaign trained her dogs while a bedridden Jonrowe watched out of the window.</p>
<p>Her unexpectedly strong finish was a way of thanking those friends, Jonrowe said. &quot;This was my way of saying, you guys didn't waste your time,&quot; she said.</p>
