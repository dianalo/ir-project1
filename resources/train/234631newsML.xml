<headline>India, Bulgaria sign agreement to bolster trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1996-12-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>India and Bulgaria signed a trade agreement on Wednesday that officials said would boost commerce between the two nations.</p>
<p>Indian ambassador to Bulgaria Nirupam Sen told reporters in the Indian capital that the two countries had agreed to extend Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to each other.</p>
<p>Under MFN, two countries agree to give each other the maximum tariff concessions on their mutual trade that they already grant to other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The new agreement was signed this morning between India and Bulgaria which aims at providing a new impetus to trade in the changing economic scenario in both the countries,&quot; Sen said.</p>
<p>Trade between India and Bulgaria fell to $16 million in 1993 from $90 million in 1985. It has since partly rebounded, and totalled some $55 million in 1995, Sen said.</p>
<p>But the value of Bulgarian exports to India is nearly five times greater than imports from India.</p>
<p>&quot;Budget constraints, banking failures and losses from state enterprises have resulted in a resource crunch which has seriously limited our buying,&quot; visiting Bulgarian Trade Minister Atanas Paparizov said.</p>
<p>Paparizov said the situation was not sustainable, and Bulgaria would have to buy more goods from India.</p>
<p>India traditionally imports fertilisers, oil products and machinery from Bulgaria, and exports graphite, processed leather, soya flour, peppercorns and pharmaceutical goods.</p>
<p>Paparizov said both countries needed to concentrate less on trade in raw materials and more on value-added goods.</p>
<p>Officials of both countries expressed optimism that trade deals involving pharmaceuticals and antibiotics would be clinched.</p>
