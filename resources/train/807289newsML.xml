<p>A currency crisis in Southeast Asian countries looks set to weigh on Japan's copper market, which was already in moderate oversupply due to sluggish domestic demand, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is slowing not only in Thailand but also in other parts of Asia such as China,&quot; an industry analyst said. &quot;If the slump in Asian currencies is prolonged, further declines in Japan's copper exports are likely.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts and industry sources say the currency crisis in some Southeast Asian countries is likely to deal an additional blow to Japan's copper exports, already hurt by a slight decline from slower economic growth in those countries.</p>
<p>Finance Ministry data shows Japan's copper exports fell to 71,030 tonnes in the first half of this year from 88,160 tonnes in the same period a year earlier. Japan's copper exports mainly go to China, Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea.</p>
<p>Industry sources and analysts say exports may fall further as the currency crisis in Thailand, which led to an agreement on a bailout package of $16.7 billion at a multilateral conference in Tokyo last week, would cut sales there.</p>
<p>The Thai baht tumbled to 31.90/32.00 to the dollar in early trade on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been virtually no spot exports to Thailand recently except for contracted exports, as business there has shrunk, squeezed by a sharp rise in interest rates,&quot; a trader at a major trading house said.</p>
<p>Minoru Hasegawa, a metal analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, added: &quot;The currency crisis in Asia poured cold water on the world copper market as the growth potential of consumption in industrialised countries such as Japan and the United States is limited.&quot;</p>
<p>In China, the market is in oversupply due to buy-backs of the metal late last year, industry sources said.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when many Japanese smelters have been running at nearly full capacity due to the dollar's advance against the yen, since treatment and refining charges are denominated in dollars, industry sources said.</p>
<p>The Ministry of International Trade and Industry expects Japan's copper output to rise 1.6 percent to 1.27 million tonnes in the year ending next March, from 1.25 million tonnes in the previous year.</p>
<p>Many smelters had pinned their hopes on exports, as domestic demand was forecast to remain flat this year after a surge in consumption ahead of Japan's sales tax increase in April.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan's physical copper market is in moderate surplus. Final products have not sold well, especially after the consumption tax was increased to five percent in April,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Industry sources said domestic demand for copper tube has been sluggish, although brass demand from the semiconductor sector has been good so far this year,</p>
<p>Traders said Japan's inventories of air conditioners using copper tube are at nearly record levels due to relatively cool summer weather and overproduction last summer.</p>
