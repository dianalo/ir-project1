<p>Indonesian property firm PT Elang Property, which has changed its name to Bakrie Land Development, got shareholder approval on Friday for a rights issue.</p>
<p>Newly appointed company chairman Bambang Irawan Hendardi told a news conference that the rights issue would be completed later this year, possibly in the third or fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Principally, our shareholders approved the idea today. But the final plan and details will be discussed at the next extraordinary general shareholders meeting in the next two months,&quot; Hendardi said.</p>
<p>He declined to give details about estimated proceeds.  </p>
<p>He said the proceeds would be used to enhance the company's working capital and financial performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is also to boost total assets from 250 billion rupiah to three or four trillion rupiah in the next three to five year rupiah so we can push Bakrie Land to become an important property player in the sector,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hendardi said the company will probably take over some Bakrie group property projects in Jakarta and Bali.</p>
<p>&quot;We also considering other opportunities such as what we did with Gelael supermarket recently,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Last week, Bakrie Land Development and PT Goro Batara Sakti formed a joint venture to provide commercial space for Gelael supermarkets.</p>
<p>Bakrie Land Development is a unit of Bakrie Capital Indonesia -- a holding company belonging to the Bakrie Group.</p>
<p>Bakrie Capital Indonesia (BCI) recently acquired a 70 percent stake in Elang Realty for 150 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>Bakrie Land commissioner Bambang Irawan Mass'ie said that BCI unit Bank Nasional had also acquired Bank Perniagaan, which belongs to the Elang Realty group.</p>
<p>&quot;So, the acquisition of Elang Realty and Bank Perniagaan is in one package at a total value of 350 billion rupiah,&quot; Irawan said.  </p>
<p>Bakrie Land finance director Ari S. Hudaja said in the first quarter of 1997, the firm posted a net loss of about 200 million rupiah compared to a net loss of about one billion rupiah in the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the company said it posted a 4.99 billion rupiah net loss in 1996.</p>
<p>Hudaja said in the first three months the company booked total revenue of 2.1 billion rupiah while expenses were about 2.3 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>No further details were given.</p>
