<p>First half profits at Dutch retail and services group Vendex International are set to rise by a healthy 25 percent, analysts said, driven largely by impressive growth in the temporary employment sector.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast net profit in the six months ending July, due on Tuesday, of 98 to 125 million guilders, versus 88 million a year ago. The consensus estimate is 109.9 million. Estimates exclude changes in the value of fixed assets and securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the growth will come from temporary employment,&quot; said MeesPierson analyst Jurgen Veenker, adding the Dutch market performed particularly well.</p>
<p>&quot;(Temporary employment) is where the main growth is in Vendex's results at the moment, where the market is really expanding,&quot; he said. The sector accounts for around 15 percent of total operating profit.</p>
<p>And with legal changes in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Spain, facilitating the use of temp workers, this growth is set to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;The structural component (of the temporary employment market) will be stronger than in the past. There will still be cyclical downturns, but they won't be as strong,&quot; Veenker said.</p>
<p>Department stores, which account for around eight percent of operating profit, will continue to recover, analysts said, as the group's renovation and modernisation programme continues.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect good results from department stores...with the reorganisation there and the fact it's less concentrated on clothing than some rivals,&quot; Generale Bank's Ab Barneveld said.</p>
<p>Food retailing, which accounts for around 20 percent of operating profit, will show a mixed picture as losses in the Belgian market diminish, analysts said.</p>
<p>The contribution from real estate, which has been a moneyspinner for the group recently, is typically hard to estimate. Some analysts put it at around 40 million guilders, others slightly lower.</p>
