<title>CHINA: China's Bao Tong released into family's custody.</title>
<headline>China's Bao Tong released into family's custody.</headline>

<p>Bao Tong, the most senior official jailed after China's 1989 student demonstrations for democracy, has been released into the custody of his family after a year of house arrest, relatives said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;But it remains to be seen how much freedom (he) will have in future,&quot; his son, Bao Puliu, said by telephone from the United States.</p>
<p>Bao Tong, former aide to disgraced Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, was released in May 1996 after serving seven years in prison for his role in the 1989 demonstrations, and immediately placed under house arrest in the suburbs of Beijing.</p>
<p>He and his family moved into a new, third-floor flat in Shijingshan in western Beijing last Saturday after the family agreed to move from their government residence.</p>
<p>&quot;Bao Tong is being shunted to Shijingshan to make it easier to control him,&quot; said a source close to the family who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Bao Tong is a source of anxiety for China's leaders, who fear he may reveal details of the dealings of the highest party and government echelons in the weeks before the bloody June 4, 1989, crackdown on demonstrators.</p>
<p>Bao Tong is barred from meeting foreign reporters because of a two-year suspension of his political rights through May 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The apartment building is brand new...making surveillance very convenient,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;Security agents could be his neighbours,&quot; the source said. &quot;He is likely to be tailed when he leaves the apartment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is in good spirits to be reunited with his family...but his health is not too good,&quot; his son said.</p>
<p>Bao Tong had been treated for a variety of ailments while in prison.</p>
<p>Bao Tong held ministerial status when he was secretary to the Communist Party's powerful Politburo Standing Committee in the late 1980s, and his family had previously refused to move from their government-allocated flat for senior officials.</p>
<p>He was the most senior official to be jailed for his role in the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Bao was convicted of leaking state secrets for passing information that notified the students that the government planned to impose martial law in Beijing in late May.</p>
<p>Bao's case has drawn fire from the United States, which has protested against his continued detention without recourse to judicial representation and without access to his family.</p>
<p>Chinese officials have defended Bao's detention, saying the measures were necessary and required by law.</p>
