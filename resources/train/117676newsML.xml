<p>The share prices dipped after market regulator set the limit of price fuctuation of a share within 10 percent of previous day's rate effective on Saturday.</p>
<p>The market turned bearish also because of recent warning by the Secuties and Exchange Commission that the invetsors must avoid trading on 24 losing listed companies and shun transactions in the kerb market.</p>
<p>&quot;The volume of trading was very low as sellers with high expectations did not budge from their positions,&quot; said broker Khurshid Alam.  </p>
<p>&quot;Buyers returned but sellers were in a rigid mood today. They (sellers) were expecting better price again after they lost in the past few days. Index rose but turnover dropped as a result,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>BD Lamp gained 668.75 taka to 7,364, Bangladesh Oxygen rose 34.73 to 484  and Shinepukur Holdings was up 15.08 at 168.</p>
