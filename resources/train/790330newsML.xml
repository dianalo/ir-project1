<title>USA: EchoStar subscriber growth accelerating.</title>

<p>EchoStar Communications Corp said Monday subscriber growth accelerated in the third quarter and the Company expects this trend to continue throughout the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>The company reported a 37 percent increase in second quarter revenues to $100.8 million, resulting in a first half increase of 50 percent to $172.8 million, and said these increases were the direct result of the company's rapidly growing DISH Network subscriber base.  </p>
<p>During the quarter, EchoStar said the DISH Network experienced strong subscriber growth, adding about 110,000 net subscribers. Since December 31, 1996, EchoStar has added 240,000 net subscribers to the network and had about 590,000 as of June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with our second quarter subscriber growth and operating results, particularly in light of our reduced marketing activities during the period,&quot; Chief Executive Charles Ergen said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This quarter we again took the lead in making satellite television even more affordable by eliminating the one-year prepaid subscription requirement to the DISH Network. This promotion improves the affordability to consumers of DISH Network receiver systems and has proven to be very popular with retailers and consumers alike.&quot;</p>
<p>As expected, the company said it had net losses of $63.8 million in the latest quarter. EchoStar's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&quot;EBITDA&quot;) was $3.0 million compared with negative $7.6 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>It said the EBITDA improvement was primarily the result of the increases in revenue combined with decreases in subscriber acquisition costs.</p>
<p>Noting its second quarter loss compared with a $22.6 million loss in the year ago quarter, EchoStar said the increase resulted principally from increases in non-cash depreciation, amortization and net interest expenses. These non-cash expenses increased approximately $39.8 million and $91.9 million during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 1997, respectively, as compared with the same periods in the prior year.</p>
