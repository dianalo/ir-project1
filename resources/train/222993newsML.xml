<p>An oil pipeline burst which triggered a massive fire in India's northeastern state of Assam has forced the closure of two major refineries, an official of the state-run Oil India Ltd (OIL) said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Bongaigaon refinery and the Barauni refinery have shut down operations today,&quot; M Bhandari, OIL's chief engineer in charge of pipelines, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bongaigaon Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd, located in Assam, has an annual capacity of 1.35 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Barauni, in the nearby eastern state of Bihar, is owned by the Indian Oil Corp, the country's largest oil refiner. It has an annual processing capacity of 3.3 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Bhandari said operations at both refineries would probably be suspended for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>&quot;The pumping of crude has been held up for an indefinite period,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Firemen battled for seven hours before the blaze could be put out, Bhandari added.</p>
<p>&quot;We have put out the fire and stopped the crude outflow,&quot; he said. &quot;The area has been cordoned off by the army and police.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bhandari said three pipelines, used to pump crude oil to Bongaigaon and Barauni refineries, had been damaged at Hajo, 30 km (19 miles) from the state capital of Guwahati were damaged.</p>
<p>Two pipelines belonged to OIL and one to IOC, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Today morning between 5 and 5.30 (2330 GMT and 0000 GMT), two bombs went off at Hajo 30 km northwest of Guwahati,&quot; Bhandari said.</p>
<p>He said he suspected the bombs were planted there by the separatist United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), which Thursday as a &quot;Protest Day&quot; in the state.</p>
<p>The leftist ULFA is fighting a decade-old campaign for an independent socialist state.</p>
<p>ULFA's main targets are officials, security forces, and tea planters. It has called for a two-hour protest blackout on Thursday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. (1230 GMT to 1430 GMT).</p>
