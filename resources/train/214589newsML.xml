<p>A lawyer in the war crimes trial of a Bosnian Serb began closing arguments for the prosecution at the U.N. criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia on Monday, calling for a conviction in the seven-month trial.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Brenda Hollis portrayed Dusan &quot;Dusko&quot; Tadic as a trusted member of the Serb nationalist SDS party who willingly took part in Serb ethnic cleansing in northwest Bosnia in 1992, persecuting his former friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>The trial, which began on May 7, has heard more than 100 witnesses and been presented with 6,000 pages of evidence, including his defence of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>&quot;If the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt your duty is to convict. The facts of this case will lead you to conclude you have a duty to convict,&quot; Hollis told the panel of three judges, which is hearing the case without a jury.</p>
<p>Tadic, a 41-year-old former cafe owner and police reserve officer, denies murdering and torturing non-Serbs as Serb attackers pushed Moslems and Croats from their homes in north western Bosnia in 1992.</p>
<p>Hollis said witness after witness had placed Tadic at notorious Serb-run detention camps where non-Serbs were murdered, raped and tortured -- sometimes laughing and joking with guards -- at other times acting with authority, selecting and beating prisoners.</p>
<p>She took issue with his defence that he was swept up in the conflict like many others in the region, saying only a privileged member of the Serb military could obtain petrol and move around the region at will as did Tadic during the period.</p>
<p>She said testimony told how Tadic, uniformed and armed, had slashed the throats of two unarmed Moslem policemen after pulling them from a column of refugees.</p>
<p>Hollis reviewed evidence that put Tadic at the notorious Omarska camp on a grisly day of torture, June 18, 1992, in which prisoners were hung up by their feet and beaten, a man was &quot;sliced up like one slices chops&quot;, and one prisoner was forced to bite off the testicle of another.</p>
<p>While no evidence directly links Tadic to the genital mutilation she said Tadic shared responsibility for the crimes committed by the rampaging group of Serbs on that day.</p>
<p>&quot;No member of that group can avoid responsibility by claiming that he did not assault a particular victim,&quot; Hollis told the judges, describing how Tadic had been seen that day with a group of soldiers which cheered on the atrocities.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no evidence of an affirmative and decisive action to remove himself from the criminal transaction (on June 18, 1992), instead the accused says he was not there,&quot; Hollis said.</p>
<p>She said the prosecution had satisfied tribunal articles, proving that the crimes of which Tadic was accused were committed during a widespread attack on a civilian population during an international conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;He (the accused) must be someone who knows that his actions are something that will contribute to a widespread and systematic attack against the population,&quot; Hollis said.</p>
<p>The case is the first war crimes trial to be heard by an international body since the Tokyo and Nuremberg trials in the aftermath of World War Two and the first full case at the Hague-based tribunal.</p>
<p>The judges, led by Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States, will hear closing arguments from the defence on Tuesday and are not expected to deliver a verdict until the new year.</p>
