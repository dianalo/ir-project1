<p>SARAJEVO, May 7 (REUTER) - These are the leading stories in the Sarajevo press on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>

<p>- Diplomatic sources say a dispute has erupted between international High Representative to Bosnia, Carl Bildt, and the head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Robert Frowick, over local elections in disputed town of Brcko. Bildt wants polling stations set up on both sides of a boundary line between Serb and Moslem-Croat territories but the OSCE wants only one polling station.</p>
<p>- If elections in Brcko are not organised in a way proposed by the OSCE, Bosnian Moslems and probably Croats as well will boycott the vote, says Munib Jusufovic, mayor in exile of Brcko.</p>
<p>- The Council of Ministers has agreed a state budget for Bosnia-Herzegovina of 130 million German marks for 1997 and plans to formally adopt it at a session on Wednesday.</p>
<p>OSLOBODJENJE</p>
<p>- After eight hours of debate, the House of Representatives of the Moslem-Croat federation failed to adopt a draft of law on the structure of new municipalities disputed by Croat and Moslem authorities.</p>
<p>- Bosnian Serb refugees can come back to Drvar only in an organised, agreed and controlled way, says local president of the Croat Democratic Union party, Drago Takmadzija, after 25 Serb houses in Croat-controlled town were torched. -- Sarajevo newsroom +387-71-663-864</p>
