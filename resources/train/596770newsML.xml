<p>The UK Labour government's plan to ban tobacco advertising will cover all forms of advertising, including sponsorship, according to Frank Dobson, secretary of state for health.</p>
<p>Dobson, in a speech to the Royal College of Nursing on Monday, said Labour's programme to reduce smoking is part of its fundamental commitment to improve the nation's health. He acknowleged that the inclusion of sponsorship in the advertising ban would affect sports' organisations.</p>
<p>Sports, he said, would be given time and help to recruit alternative sponsors. However, Dobson didn't say what kind of help the government might be prepared to offer.</p>
<p>&quot;As I've said, we don't want to harm these sports but they must recognise that by helping promote the sales of tobacco they are harming the health of many of their own sports spectators and viewers,&quot; Dobson said.</p>
<p>Labour's proposals for reducing tobacco consumption will be spelled out in a White Paper, due to be completed by the summer. A draft bill to ban tobacco advertising is expected to be published by the autumn.</p>
