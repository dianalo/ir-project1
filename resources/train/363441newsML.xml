<title>USA: KCBT wheat ends mixed as spreads unravel.</title>
<headline>KCBT wheat ends mixed as spreads unravel.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1997-02-07</dateline>

<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended mixed, with nearby months under pressure as some players unraveled their bull-spread positions, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said a perceived increase in country movement pressured the March contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Up in Minneapolis, they had about 300 cars traded on the floor, which would suggest that logistical problems up there are starting to ease. At the same time, we're seeing some old crop HRW wheat moving. That encouraged people to come out of their bull-spreads,&quot; a KCBT floor broker said.</p>
<p>Traders said new crop KCBT July wheat drew some support from reports that recent snows were not as heavy as originally hoped in key growing regions of southwest Kansas.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat closed 1-1/2 cents per bushel lower to 2-1/2 cents higher, with March down 1-1/2 cents at $4.12-1/2.</p>
<p>Among players involved in bear-spreading were Prudential, which sold 600,000 bushels of the March/May spread, and E D &amp; F Man International, which sold 700,000.</p>
<p>Traders said key commercial Term Commodities bought 900,000 March bushels.</p>
