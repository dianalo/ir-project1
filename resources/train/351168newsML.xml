<text>
<p>Singapore shares closed higher on Monday after a day when electronics stocks stole the limelight but failed to inspire market-wide lift, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The broader market hasn't really moved much even though some individual shares have been doing well,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The day's run-away performer was multi-media firm Creative Technology, leaping Singapore $2.70 to S$21.00 after massively improved interim profits.</p>
<p>But the huge surge did not influence the key Straits Times Industrials Index edging up 1.59 to 2,218.06 at the close.  </p>
<p>Broader sentiment saw shares trading sideways for the rest of the week as the Chinese New Year and Muslim Eid Al-Fitr festivals approached. Creative led the day's 142 gainers.</p>
<p>The market's 215 losers were headed by OCBC Bank's foreign shares, down S$0.80 to S$18.40 on Friday's news that merger talks with Malaysia's Pacific Bank had collapsed.</p>
<p>Dealers saw interest in Malaysian over-the-counter stocks with motor trader Oriential Holdings Bhd up S$0.90 at S$12.10 while eight million warrants traded in developer Renong Bhd moved the price up S$0.015 to S$0.940.</p>
