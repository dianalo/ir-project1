<title>AUSTRALIA: AUSTRALIAN COMMODITIES ROUNDUP - AUGUST 8.</title>
<headline>AUSTRALIAN COMMODITIES ROUNDUP - AUGUST 8.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Aluminium prices rose in London overnight on a short squeeze, while zinc and copper also rose slightly on bank buying.</p>
<p>Gold rose over US$3 an ounce to US$321.95 on continued buying by one or two investment banks, but sentiment remains fragile.</p>
<p>Oil prices rose again as new Iraqi supplies appeared closer, while wheat prices rose on good news for U.S. exports and after Canada cut its wheat forecast.</p>
<p>The CRB Index rose 0.02 to 242.83.</p>
<p>LONDON METALS</p>
<p>Aluminium powered higher on Thursday afternoon as a squeeze continued to lift prices above most forecasts, while copper and zinc also extended their rallies.</p>
<p>Three months aluminium snapped to $1,775 per tonne, the highest since October 9, 1995. At Thursday's peak, prices had gained $213 or nearly 14 percent over the past three weeks, fuelled by bank and fund buying.</p>
<p>It ended the day up $21 at $1,762.50.</p>
<p>The market is well above what most forecasts targeted and is looking somewhat overbought, but the squeeze gives it more upside potential, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the very short term it looks as though it will continue to make ground, but we would be looking for a bit of a correction in the fourth quarter,&quot; said analyst Jim Lennon of Macquarie Equities.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of the price over 80 cents (per lb) today, that's certainly well ahead of when we thought it would get there, we were thinking probably early 1998,&quot; said Lennon.</p>
<p>&quot;It does have all the hallmarks of an artificial squeeze,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Zinc extended its recent recovery as the cash/threes spread held steady around the $100 mark.</p>
<p>Bank buying spurred a move to $1,557 in the morning, the highest since last week's dive. Forward selling trimmed the peaks and prices hovered with pared gains in the afternoon, closing $12 firmer at $1,540.</p>
<p>Copper got swept up in the excitement, breaking above resistance at $2,320 and sparking some short-covering.</p>
<p>It hit a high of $2,335, closing just off the peak at $2,333, showing a gain for the day of $35.</p>
<p>Stocks only increased by 800 tonnes on Thursday, less than usual.</p>
<p>The other metals looked at the upside, with lead holding its morning gains and ending $12 higher at $618. Nickel added $100 to $7,260, moving to the top of the past two days trading range.</p>
<p>GOLD</p>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended mostly higher Thursday, after expectations for more losses were confounded early by continued buying by one or two investment banks, forcing locals and funds to cover short positions.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the market is still looking for lower prices, but people are less willing to stick their necks out on the short side until things settle down a bit,&quot; said Credit Lyonnais Rouse New York chief bullion dealer Scott Mehlman.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold looks like its trying to build a base around $320 (in COMEX December gold), with $317-318 on the bottom and $324-325 on the top and I wouldn't be surprised to see any of those prices trade.&quot;</p>
<p>Goldman Sach's continued to be the main buyer supporting COMEX gold futures, though was seen on the offer in the cash market, many traders said. In late July, Goldman Sachs handled the 1.1 million ounce hedge buy back for Newmont Mining. In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $321.70/20, compared to the London Thursday afternoon fix at $321.00 and the New York close Wednesday around $318.30/80.</p>
<p>WHEAT</p>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on export news and news the Canadian Wheat Board sharply cut its estimate for Canadian wheat production, traders said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Wheat Board Thursday said it was forecasting wheat output in western Canada this year of 21.6 million tonnes, below the 29.5 million produced last year.</p>
<p>Also USDA's weekly export sales report Thursday pegged U.S. net export sales of wheat for the 1997-98 (June-May) marketing year at 765,100 tonnes, above expectations for 650,000 to 750,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Also there was talk Egypt by this weekend would be in the market for 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of wheat. Wheat closed two cents higher to two lower, with September up one at $3.63-1/4. Gains were limited by a drop in corn and soybean futures plus rain in Australia's dry wheat region.</p>
<p>CRUDE OIL</p>
<p>Cash crude prices in the U.S. Gulf slumped mid-afternoon Thursday due to collapsing gasoline values and Iraqi supply, traders said.</p>
<p>September West Texas Intermediate/Cushing stood around 35 cents lower at $20.05-15 a barrel, some 20 cents weaker than the second month October WTI/Cushing month.</p>
<p>Immediate-term price pressure is being generated from a number of factors, traders said, but mostly on expectations for the return of Iraqi crude exports in the next week. By Friday morning, Iraq will likely be allowed to submit oil contracts to U.N. overseers for renewed &quot;oil-for-food&quot; sales, following expiration of a &quot;no-objection&quot; period in the U.N. Sanctions Committee for approving Baghdad's price formula.  </p>
