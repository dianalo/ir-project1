<title>HONG KONG: Japan snubs origami boats from HK isles protesters.</title>

<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-09-30</dateline>

<p>Japanese consulate officials in Hong Kong refused on Monday to accept a fleet of folded paper boats offered in a new protest over Tokyo's control of a small group of islands in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>A group of protesters including legislators tried to hand over the flotilla of origami boats together with a protest message saying they would carry on the mission of an activist who drowned in a protest near the isles last Thursday.</p>
<p>David Chan died after jumping off a protest ship into the China Sea in defiance of a Japanese blockade of the disputed islands, which Chinese call the Diaoyus and Japan refers to as the Senkaku islands.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, tens of thousands of people sobbed in mourning for Chan at a candlelight vigil in a Hong Kong park, the biggest outpouring of emotion against Japan in two months of protests by Chinese in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and China.</p>
<p>&quot;These paper boats are made from pamphlets distributed last night in memory of David Chan,&quot; Democratic Party legislator Sin Chung-kai told reporters after Monday's protest.</p>
<p>&quot;The paper boats confirm the fact that we wish to fight for the Diaoyu Islands. These paper boats represent more ships that will be sent to the Diaoyu Islands to continue David's efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;They refused to accept them because they refuse to accept that the islands are part of China,&quot; Sin said.</p>
<p>A consulate official accepted the note to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto condemning &quot;the revival of Japanese militarism and the Japanese naval presence in Chinese waters around the islands&quot;.</p>
<p>Protests began in July after a Japanese right-wing group erected a lighthouse and flags on the isles.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed the uninhabited islands northeast of Taiwan since 1895 and refuses to discuss sovereignty issues about the territory. China has claimed them for centuries.</p>
<p>Both governments, reluctant to wreck their relations over the issue, are at a loss how to deal with the wave of nationalist passion. Taiwan also claims the islets.</p>
<p>The body of Chan, a 45-year-old media consultant who had led many Diaoyu protests, was flown home to a hero's welcome last Friday in a coffin draped with the communist Chinese red flag.</p>
<p>He had been aboard a protest ship with 17 other activists, and had taken his fatal plunge as Japanese patrol boats barred the ship from landing protesters on the islands.</p>
<p>Chan's family said they want his ashes to be scattered over the isles. His funeral is next Sunday.</p>
<p>A new flotilla carrying 50 activists will set sail in a week.</p>
