<p>China's transportation sector is bracing for a deluge of holiday travellers early next year, with people expected to make hundreds of millions of trips by boat, bus and train, the Guangming Daily said on Monday.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 trains, 35,000 buses and 180 boats would be added to existing services to handle the tide of humanity that is expected to swamp China's transport system during the holiday season from January 18 to March 8, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Most of the added capacity would be to carry returning migrant workers who had moved from rural areas to the cities in search of work, it said.</p>
<p>People would make about 133 million trips on the nation's railways and an estimated 1.53 billion trips on buses and boats during the period, the daily said.</p>
<p>Many of China's 1.2 billion people hit the road to visit their families during the weeks around the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, the most important Chinese holiday. Next year's Spring Festival falls on February 7.</p>
