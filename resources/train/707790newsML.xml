<p>The world dry bulk cargo freight market is expected to remain weak at least until next year, a top Indian shipping industry leader said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the overall supply and demand position in the world today, I personally feel that the market is unlikely to pick up until 1998,&quot; said K.M. Sheth, chairman of the Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd and former president of the Indian Shipowners' Association (INSA).</p>
<p>&quot;The demand has gone up but the supply is much more,&quot; he said. &quot;The market will just keep on going at the level that it is prevailing with a few points up or down every day.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he was unable to give any figures.</p>
<p>Sheth said a number of shipping companies the world over had placed orders two years ago when shipbuilding costs were low.</p>
<p>&quot;They are all bunching up. The deliveries of all those orders are now coming out of the shipyards and that's what has increased the supply,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>According to industry sources, nearly 390 ships are expected to be delivered between now and the first half of 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will remain depressed in the remaining part of 1997 and the early part of 1998,&quot; Sheth said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, on the other hand, the tanker freight market is very firm. Up to the middle of 1999 or the second half of 1999 I see the tanker market remaining quite firm,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern Shipping Company Ltd is India's biggest private sector shipping firm and owns 46 ships.</p>
