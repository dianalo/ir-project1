<p>A variety of West African and Latin American crudes beckoned U.S. Gulf Coast refiners on Monday, while North Sea crudes remained pricey, traders said.</p>
<p>The spread between April West Texas Intermediate/Cushing and North Sea Brent sank to around $1.30-35 cents a barrel Monday afternoon, down 10 cents from Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Despite falling CFD prices, traders saw little chance that Brent would head toward the Gulf.</p>
<p>Brent was assessed at a discount of five cents to WTI/Cushing, costly in light of the availability of West African and Latin American barrels.</p>
<p>Swiss-based trading house Glencore was supposedly working a ULCC to the Gulf, but traders speculated that the cargoes would be sold into Europe or sold off into the market instead.</p>
<p>From West Africa, Bonny Light and Qua Iboe were assessed at April WTI plus 35-45 cents a barrel for end-March early April delivery, while Forcades was at a premium of around 15-20 cents.</p>
<p>On the Latin American front, two out of an original five cargoes of Colombian Cano Limon loading in March were still available, traders said.</p>
<p>The prices ranged from WTI/Cushing minus $2.50 a barrel for prompt loading, to minus $2.25 a barrel for end-March loading.</p>
<p>Exxon bought at least two cargoes of Cano Limon recently, quelling earlier speculation that the U.S. major had cut off spot purchases of the grade.</p>
