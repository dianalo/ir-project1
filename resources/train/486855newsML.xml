<p>Canadian bonds closed weaker on Friday, with spreads to U.S. long bonds widening, as further weakness in the Canadian dollar and a slide in U.S. Treasuries pulled the market lower, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the Bank of Canada) didn't move rates and the Canadian dollar tone has soured since then. That's what has really led to our underperformance,&quot; said Harv Kalirai, Canadian analyst with New York-based I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.80 to C$106.35 to yield 7.444 percent. The U.S. 30-year bond fell 22/32 to yield 7.13 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the two bonds widened to 31 basis points from 30 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds and the dollar initially traded stronger this morning after Statistics Canada said the country's unemployment rate fell to a lower-than-expected 9.3 percent in March from 9.7 percent in February. The March unemployment rate is now the lowest since November 1995.</p>
<p>However, Canadian bonds and the dollar quickly sold off following the release of the U.S. employment report for March which showed stronger-than-expected gains in hourly wages.  </p>
<p>The U.S. jobs data added to speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike rates again when it meets in May. In spite of this, the Bank of Canada did not hike short-term interest rates this morning as many in the market had anticipated and the dollar weakened.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar made a partial recovery to C$1.3916 (US$0.7185) from a new two-year low around C$1.3933 (US$0.7177), but still ended the day weaker than the C$1.3902 (US$0.7193) open.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.62 to C$100.48 to yield 6.929 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. bond fell 11/32 to yield 6.91 percent.</p>
<p>The between the bonds moved to a positive spread of two basis points from a negative spread of one basis point at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.25 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.28 percent.</p>
