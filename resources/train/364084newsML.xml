<title>UK: Spurs' Sugar sees sweet pay/view prospects.</title>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur chairman Alan Sugar said on Friday that English soccer clubs could quadruple their television income when pay-per-view becomes a reality.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question it is a very exciting era but we have to be careful not to overestimate early revenues,&quot; Sugar said in an interview with The Guardian newspaper, noting it would take some time before multi-channel digital television really gets going.</p>
<p>&quot;But when it does click in it will be exciting. At present, the average club gets eight or nine million pounds from the BSkyB deal. My gut feeling is that pay-per-view could be worth three or four times that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Satellite broadcaster BSkyB last year signed a 670 million pound deal to retain live rights to the English premier league. BSkyB is launching 200-channel digital satellite television into the UK later this year and pay-per-view soccer is expected eventually to become part of its digital package.</p>
<p>Sugar said he believed that clubs such as Tottenham and English champions Manchester United might, with time, develop into broader leisure companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at Whitbread: they see themselves as a leisure business and they bought David Lloyd's tennis centre company. There's no reason why Manchester United Plc or Tottenham Hotspur Plc couldn't make a similar acquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>But Sugar had words of warning for potential investors in the growing list of soccer clubs joining the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;Football at the moment is fashionable but institutions need to look deeply into some of these clubs. There's a lot of hype going on at the moment. There will be disasters and disappointments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The clubs with the right approach will shine through and will remain in the long term. But there is no room for anyone who thinks they can come along and make a quick buck.&quot;</p>
