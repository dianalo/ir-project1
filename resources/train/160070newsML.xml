<headline>U.S. Spring/White Wheat - Movement up as MGE falls.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spring wheat sales picked up slightly on Friday as farmers started to abandon ideas that spring wheat prices would firm, several cash brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing a pickup in country movement,&quot; a Minnesota dealer said. &quot;I think the wheat has gotten cheap enough that the farmer has given up.&quot;</p>
<p>Farmers had been reluctant to sell in hopes prices would firm, but hopes were fading fast after another fresh contract low was set Friday.</p>
<p>MGE December wheat closed at $3.85-1/4 cents per bushel on Friday and set a contract low. Prices peaked at $6.34 in May.</p>
<p>A large world wheat crop and persistent talk that U.S. wheat was overvalued compared to other exporters weighed on prices, merchandisers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The producer has finally said he's sick and tired of hanging on to the wheat,&quot; a Montana dealer said.  </p>
