<title>SRI LANKA: Sri Lanka leader tells opposition to end violence.</title>
<headline>Sri Lanka leader tells opposition to end violence.</headline>
<dateline>COLOMBO 1997-03-05</dateline>

<p>Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga said on Wednesday it was up to the main opposition United National Party (UNP) to end political violence which had gripped the country in the runup to local government polls.</p>
<p>&quot;We have done what we can to stop political violence,&quot; she said in an interview on state television. &quot;The UNP must decide whether it wants to stop political violence. Only then will it stop.&quot;</p>
<p>Kumaratunga's remarks came shortly after the government announced it had extended until March 15 an amnesty for the surrender of illegal weapons, at the request of political leaders. The amnesty was scheduled to lapse on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 170 firearms have been seized since police launched a nationwide crackdown to curb political violence ahead of March 21 local government elections, a government statement said.</p>
<p>Police have said they fear increased violence before the polls and warned political parties of possible attacks at election rallies.</p>
<p>The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence said at the weekend that nearly 500 incidents of election-related violence, mostly threats against candidates and their supporters, had been reported up to Friday.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean island's gun culture became a key public issue after a young ruling People's Alliance coalition legislator was gunned down last month.</p>
<p>A UNP member of parliament and a former UNP mayor are among the suspects detained over the killing during a roadside quarrel between alliance and UNP supporters.</p>
<p>Politicians and political activists in Sri Lanka own guns, many of them unlicensed, to protect themselves against possible attack by Tamil rebels who are fighting a separatist war in the island's north and east.</p>
<p>UNP leader and former prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe recently called for consensus among all political parties on the surrender of weapons.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga said she had restrained her supporters to prevent them taking revenge on UNP supporters after the alliance won power in 1994, ending the UNP's 17-year reign.</p>
<p>&quot;Our supporters were waiting to take revenge but we told them we will not allow it and will punish those who misbehave,&quot; she said. &quot;We eliminated political terrorism within 24 hours of winning power.&quot;</p>
