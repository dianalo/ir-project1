<text>
<p>Hilton Hotels Corp on Friday said it has made a cash offer to purchase the first mortgage notes of Bally's Grand Inc, an 85 percent-owned subsidiary of Bally Entertainment Corp.</p>
<p>Hilton said it offered to purchase all of the 10-3/8 percent Bally's Grand first mortgage notes due December 2003, at a price calculated to result in a yield to the first call date based on a spread to the comparable Treasury yield of 100 basis points.  </p>
<p>Based on the Treasury rate on Oct. 23, that price is 110.83 percent -- 108.83 percent for the tender and 2.0 percent for the consent fee  -- of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.</p>
<p>Hilton started a tender for Bally Park Place Funding Inc's 9-1/4 percent first mortgage notes due March 2004, at a 75 basis point spread to the comparable U.S. Treasury. Based on the Treasury rate on Oct. 23, the call price would be 109.01 percent -- 107.01 percent for the tender and a 2.00 percent consent fee -- of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest.  </p>
<p>Hilton is offering to buy GNF Corp's 10-5/8 percent first mortgage notes due April 2003, at a 75 basis point spread to the comparable U.S. Treasury note. Based on the Treasury rate on Oct. 23, the call price would be 109.96 percent -- 107.96 percent for the tender and 2.00 percent for the consent fee -- of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest.</p>
<p>Lastly, Hilton's offer extends to Bally's Casino Holdings Inc senior discount notes and senior discount notes due June 1998, at a 75 basis point spread. Based on the Treasury rate on Oct. 23, the price is 105.93 percent -- 103.93 percent for the tender and the 2.00 percent fee -- of the accreted value.</p>
<p>The offers are part of a refinancing for Hilton's pending merger with Bally and are contingent upon, among other things, closing the merger. The merger is expected to close in early December and is not contingent upon closing the tender offers.</p>
<p>All of the tender offers will expire at 0930 EST/1430 GMT on Thursday, Dec. 12, 1996, unless extended by Hilton.</p>
<p>Hilton also announced that upon completion of the merger, it intends to redeem all the Bally 10 percent convertible subordinated debentures due 2006 and the six percent convertible subordinated debentures due 1998.</p>
