<title>USA: Orange County seeks release of Merrill Lynch files.</title>
<headline>Orange County seeks release of Merrill Lynch files.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA ANA, Calif. 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The battle for grand jury transcripts about Merrill Lynch &amp; Co's role in the Orange County bankruptcy crisis heated up on Tuesday with county attorneys pressing for release of the documents.</p>
<p>In a brief filed in Orange County Superior Court, attorneys for the southern California county said they should be given access to the transcripts for use in the county's $2-billion-plus civil lawsuit against the brokerage giant.  </p>
<p>&quot;The public deserves to understand and be informed of the full course of events leading up to the financial collapse, including both the actions of its public officials and those who acted in concert with them, to determine who bears responsibility and how to ensure that such events do not recur,&quot; county attorneys said in their court filing. &quot;The policies favoring disclosure of the transcripts far outweigh the policies surrounding grand jury secrecy.&quot;</p>
<p>The county shocked Wall Street in 1994 when it filed for bankruptcy after losing more than $1.6 billion on risky investments. The county emerged from bankruptcy one year ago.  </p>
<p>Hoping to recover the funds it lost, the county filed a civil lawsuit against Merrill Lynch, alleging it sold the county risky securities in violation of law. The case is scheduled to go to trial in September 1998.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch has denied any wrongdoing and is contesting the county's allegations in court.</p>
<p>The Orange County district attorney's investigation of the bankruptcy crisis took a surprising turn in June when Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $30 million to settle the probe. The settlement ensured Merrill Lynch and its employees would not face criminal charges, prosecutors said.  </p>
<p>Initially, prosecutors said they would try to find a way to unseal transcripts from the grand jury's investigation. The district attorney's office later announced that it could not release the files because no indictments were issued.</p>
<p>A hearing has been set for July 30 in Orange County Superior Court to debate the issue.</p>
<p>County attorneys argued that the grand jury transcripts should be released because they would be of &quot;substantial benefit to the court in determining the truth in the Merrill Lynch civil action.&quot;  </p>
<p>Orange County prosecutors said the law does not allow them to release the grand jury testimony.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply put, the transcription and release of the sought-after grand jury transcripts, would be without legal authority,&quot; Wallace Wade, an assistant Orange County district attorney, said in a recent court filing. &quot;The law simply does not permit testimony or evidence to be made public when it was taken in closed, non-public sessions ... and no indictment or accusation was returned.&quot;</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch declined to comment on the transcripts.</p>
