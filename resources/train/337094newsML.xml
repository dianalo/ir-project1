<title>UK: Aerodata may bid for Scott Pickford.</title>

<p>Australian geotechnical survey specialist Aerodata Holdings said on Tuesday it was prepared to offer 55p per share to shareholders in British oil services company Scott Pickford Plc if it could agree terms.</p>
<p>Aerodata already has a cross-shareholding arrangement with Scott Pickford, and planned to extend this to an operational collaboration over time, but saw its plans thrown into jeopardy by a recent full takeover bid for Scott Pickford launched by U.S. company Core Laboratories NV.  </p>
<p>Aerodata said in its statement it was in talks with Scott Pickford &quot;with a view to formalising an offer valued at 55p per share&quot;, but such an offer would be subject to the board of Scott Pickford recommending it at that price level.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Core made a cash offer at 53p, valuing the British company at about 6.7 million pounds, and Aerodata's initial response was to say it would be prepared to match this.</p>
<p>However, Core then raised by 4p to 57p on the condition that a planned share exchange betweeen Scott and Aerodata be stopped.</p>
<p>At the centre of the triangle, Scott has declined to make a decisive move in either direction so far and has continued to recommend its shareholders to take no action.</p>
<p>In its Tuesday statement, Aerodata also said it wished to take issue with Core's reporting of bid acceptances.</p>
<p>On Monday Core said it had won acceptances totalling 47.56 percent of Scott's shares, comprising 14.99 percent who had accepted the 53p bid and another 32.57 percent who had signed up for the conditional 57p offer.</p>
<p>Aerodata, which has begun a legal challenge to enforce its share exchange plan, said that Core could only claim to have 14.99 percent as irrevocable acceptances, and called the remainder &quot;imply non-legally binding statements of intent&quot;.</p>
