<p>A total of 16 companies entered bids at Wednesday's U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) tender for around 500,000 pounds of stockpiled cobalt.</p>
<p>The quality of the metal on offer ranged from 98.40 to 99.30 percent quality, with some parcels of 99.40 percent traders said.</p>
<p>The highest bid of $18.88 a pound was submitted by Minor Metals Inc, followed by $18.8615 a pound by Powmet. Sogem-Afrimet and Glencore entered the lowest bids at $16.56 and $17.00 a pound respectively. The result of the tender will be announced later in August.</p>
<p>Traders that the tender was oversubscribed by nearly five times the amount on offer.</p>
<p>Several suggested that this was constructive to the markets near term trend. &quot;It shows that demand is strong as the bids totalled more than 2.4 million pounds,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said in Europe said the material was old, possibly dating back to the 1950s.</p>
<p>They suggested that it would be suitable for use in the manufacture of magnets and chemicals where lower grade cobalt is used, but not by the superalloys industry.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is finding support from a workers strike at Falconbridge's Sudbury, Ontario facilities. One trader estimated that five tonnes per day is being lost due to the strike.</p>
<p>However, others said that the strike was as yet not seriously impacting on the market as the facility would normally be closed for a couple of weeks during late Jmuly/early August for maintenance.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike will have to drag on to have a major impact,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Cobalt prices are expected to firm as consumers cover their requirements for the fourth quarter traders said. They also noted that prices have remained stable during the traditionally slow summer period.</p>
<p>Traders said that dealer stocks are at record lows and, also, that the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia production levels were running at low levels.</p>
<p>On Friday in Europe Russian 99.3 percent cobalt was indicated around $19.60/20.60, while high grade material minimum 99.8 percent was around $23.00/$24.00 a pound.</p>
