<title>USA: Exxon mulls refining ventures - analysts.</title>
<headline>Exxon mulls refining ventures - analysts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Exxon Corp may consider joint ventures or alliances in the refining sector, chairman and chief executive Lee Raymond told analysts in New York.</p>
<p>No one from Exxon was immediately available for comment and its shares came off their lows during afternoon trade to close off 1/4 at $102-3/4 having been as low as 102 1/8 during the day.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Raymond indicated he was quite happy with the performance of Exxon's domestic refining operations, although he did note that the Baytown refinery was not matching expected returns.  </p>
<p>&quot;The comments on alliances or joint ventures were made in reference to refining as a whole, not to Baytown in particular,&quot; said an analyst.</p>
<p>Raymond also told analysts that he saw the annual increase in oil production rising from the current 1.5 percent to three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;That is fairly significant given that Exxon is so conservative,&quot; said an analyst.</p>
<p>One analyst also noted that Raymond said he expected Exxon's debt ratio to continue to fall even allowing for dividends, divestments and capital expenditure.  </p>
<p>&quot;Somewhere along the line it looks as if the company is likely to do a share buyback or an acquisition,&quot; the analyst commented.</p>
<p>Raymond also emphasised Exxon's gas to liquid technology, which an analyst said could transform the economics of remote area gas production. ((-- David Chance New York Newsroom 212 859 1902))</p>
