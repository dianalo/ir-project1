<p>Philips Electronics NV said Wednesday that first-quarter profit jumped 22 percent as its consumer products unit swung back into the plus column in what it described as a sustainable recovery.</p>
<p>Europe's biggest consumer electronics group said net profit from normal operations climbed to 460 million guilders ($239 million) from 377 million, with the removal of loss-making German unit Grundig from the operating results making a significant impact.</p>
<p>Operating profit in the first quarter rose 21 percent and sales grew 3 percent to 16.14 billion guilders ($8.39 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;Grundig's out, that in itself makes for a significantly better picture,&quot; Vice Chairman Dudley Eustace told a news conference.</p>
<p>But he added fundamental changes in the heart of the consumer products division were also bearing fruit after the huge restructuring begun last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The first-quarter results provide us with the confidence that we are on track following the improvement programme started in 1996,&quot; Philips said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Philips consumer products unit, which includes Grundig and Sound &amp; Vision, turned in an operating profit vs. a loss a year earlier.</p>
<p>The electronics giant said at the beginning of 1997 that it would no longer absorb 100 percent of Grundig's losses. Instead it would become a passive minority shareholder, booking Grundig's results under income from unconsolidated companies in proportion to Philips' 31.6 percent stake.</p>
<p>But Philips' semiconductor unit, a main profit centre in recent years, saw operating earnings fall almost 14 percent.</p>
<p>Philips said sales had stagnated year-on-year, but added &quot;this reflects an upward trend in performance compared with the fourth quarter of 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts' initial reactions to the net profit figure -- which came in well ahead of consensus expectations guilders -- were positive, albeit cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased with this result and the progress that has been booked in this first quarter,&quot; ING Barings' Steven Vrolijk said.</p>
<p>But Delta Lloyd Bank's Peter Wortel was less upbeat. &quot;Looking simply at the figures, it's good,&quot; he said. &quot;Looking deeper...we had expected semiconductors to do better. In fact they're lower.&quot;</p>
