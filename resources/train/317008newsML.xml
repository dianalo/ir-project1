<p>NYMEX electricity futures ended the week lower, tumbling with weaker cash prices in the western U.S. due to ample hydroelectric supplies, forecasts of mild weather and plunging natural gas futures.</p>
<p>Peak, firm electricity prices for day-ahead delivery in the West fell sharply for a second day, down another $10.00 a megawatt hour (MWh) at the Palo Verde (PV) switchyard near Phoenix, Arizona, and the California-Oregon border (COB).</p>
<p>COB and PV next-day power prices for firm, peak delivery finished in the teens, about a third from the highs early this week when much of the western half of the country was hit with arctic cold.</p>
<p>Outlook of warmer weather across the U.S. next week also put downward pressure on natural gas prices.</p>
<p>NYMEX February Henry Hub gas futures settled down 8.4 cents at $3.257 cents per million British thermal units after reaching as low as $3.080.</p>
<p>February natgas deliveries to the San Juan/Blanco Hub fell to $2.85-$2.95 from Thursday's $3.00-$3.04.</p>
<p>February COB settled down 80 cents at $13.85/MWh, near a session low of $13.75 and not far from its contract low of $13.00. March COB finished down 55 cents at $11.80.</p>
<p>February PV settled down 99 cents at $16.00/MWh after bouncing between $15.90 and $16.25. March PV ended down 65 cents at $13.75.</p>
<p>Market participants expect the complex to continue this week's downward trend amid little supportive fundamental news and forecasts of mild weather out West.</p>
<p>&quot;It's got room to go. You're going to see it pushed down,&quot; said a Houston futures trader.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, temperatures were forecast to average above normal into early next week, while precipitation would run near to above normal.</p>
<p>Down in the Southwest, sunny, dry weather would prevail this weekend with temperatures averaging five to 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal by Sunday and early next week.</p>
<p>NYMEX estimated 273 COB and 135 PV contracts were sold.</p>
