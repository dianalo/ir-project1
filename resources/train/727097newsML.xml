<p>Israel's June consumer index (CPI), to be released on Tuesday, is expected to show a rise of 0.5 to 0.8 percent against an increase of 0.5 percent in May, economists said on Monday.</p>
<p>A rise of 0.8 percent would bring year-on-year inflation to 8.1 percent. The government has set an inflation target of 7-10 percent for all of 1997.</p>
<p>Economists said the sharp drop of the shekel against the dollar in the last week of June would have only a marginal impact on June's index but would likely drive up the July CPI significantly.</p>
<p>&quot;The full brunt of the depreciation will be felt in July's index. It will be around one percent, which is relatively high for July,&quot; said Jonathan Katz, chief economist at Solid Financial Markets.</p>
<p>The Israeli shekel dropped as much as five percent in the last week of June after the government announced changes in the exchange rate mechanism and the Bank of Israel slashed interest rates. The Israeli currency subsequently regained part of its losses.</p>
<p>Katz, who said he estimated the June index would show a 0.7 percent or 0.8 percent rise, said he expected seasonal factors to be offset by a three to four percent rise in government-controlled prices of some food items.</p>
<p>&quot;The June index is usually low because of a drop in the price of fruit and vegetables during this season,&quot; Katz said.</p>
<p>Victor Shohet of Ofek Securities said he is looking for a 0.8 percent rise, mainly due to housing prices, an important component of the index. &quot;Housing prices will push it up,&quot; he said, citing the influence of dollar-linked home prices.</p>
<p>But Adam Reuter of Financial Immunities, a consulting firm, said he expected a lower 0.5 percent rise.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the dollar that rose from the end of June had very little effect on June inflation. We'll feel the effect later,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Katz said he did not think this month's index would prompt the Bank of Israel to lower interest rates again. On June 18, the bank cut rates 1.2 percentage points to an annualised 12.7 percent.</p>
