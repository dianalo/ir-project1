<p>Trans World Airlines Inc., which is struggling to return to profitability after last year's crash of Flight 800, said it will cut 1,000 jobs by December because younger jets being added to its fleet will reduce its maintenance needs.</p>
<p>As &quot;new aircraft with fewer scheduled maintenance requirements come to constitute a larger and larger portion of our fleet, we are required to adjust our staffing to more closely reflect industry standards,&quot; said William Compton, TWA's executive vice president of operations.</p>
<p>The job cuts will reduce TWA's work force to just under 23,000 employees, the St. Louis-based airline said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a positive and quite needed step,&quot; said Brian Harris, an airline analyst at Lehman Brothers. &quot;They are overstaffed in most of their job categories.&quot;</p>
<p>Job cuts and fleet impovements are only two steps in TWA's turnaround efforts. To survive in the long term, TWA must bolster its cash reserves, attract more high-paying business customers, and stem the bleeding of profits, analysts said.</p>
<p>TWA, which has lost money ever since the Paris-bound Boeing 747 exploded off the coast of Long Island, N.Y., last year, is expected to announce another loss when it reports its second-quarter financial results Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wall Street expects TWA to post a second-quarter loss of 23 cents a share, compared with a profit of 45 cents a share a year earlier, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>A TWA spokesman said the airline was not aware of any one-time charges or severance costs related to the layoffs.</p>
<p>The job cuts are an inevitable part of upgrading the fleet, as newer planes require less maintenance work and fewer workers, analysts said.</p>
<p>TWA plans to take delivery of about 52 new and recent-vintage used aircraft worth more than $2 billion over the next two years.</p>
<p>The St. Louis-based carrier said the average age of its fleet will shrink to 16.7 years by the end of the year, down from the current average of about 17.8 years, but higher than the industry average of 11.9 years.</p>
<p>TWA, the seventh largest U.S. airline, declined to comment on whether additional staff changes would be made after December.</p>
<p>&quot;This (job cut announcement) brings us through December. Beyond that, I don't know,&quot; said TWA spokesman Mark Abels. &quot;We're always looking at increasing the productivity of our work force.&quot;</p>
<p>The layoffs include 250 posts at its overhaul base in Kansas City, Mo., and 625 in maintenance, airport operations and reservations.</p>
<p>One industry analyst said although some job cuts were expected, the layoffs in the reservations unit were inconsistent with TWA's statement that it was slashing jobs because of reduced maintenance needs.</p>
<p>Twenty-three of TWA's domestic line maintenance stations will be consolidated into 13 locations, reducing staff by 200, airport operations staff will be cut by about 200 and reservations sales staff by 225 positions, for a total of 625 in those three areas.</p>
<p>Most maintenance job cuts will be made through furloughs, although some will be made through attrition, while most of the airport operations and all of the reservations sales staff cuts will be made through attrition, TWA said.</p>
<p>Management, non-contract and contract employees will be affected, the airline said.</p>
<p>Line maintenance stations under review for closure include those at Boston; Washington National; Washington Dulles; Philadelphia; Miami; Cleveland; Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati; and Detroit. The list of line maintenance station closings will be reviewed with representatives of TWA's machinists union, the company said.</p>
<p>The machinists union could not be reached for comment.</p>
