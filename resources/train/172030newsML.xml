<p>Former Springbok coach Ian McIntosh believes the new rule allowing tactical substitutions will promote more continuous rugby union action.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly something we'll never do again is to play our top players in every game,&quot; McIntosh said. &quot;What happened was that our top players were getting tired and other good, international players weren't getting rugby.</p>
<p>&quot;We then got into a situation where we said: `Hell, we can't put that guy on now because he's not fit and yet the other guy's tired and he needs a rest'. But that won't happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>McIntosh, who coached South African province Natal to their fourth Currie Cup title in seven years last month, said the change was necessary due to the increase of games brought on by professionalism.</p>
<p>Tactical player substitutions were used for the first time in Monday's tour match between South Africa A and Bedford in England.</p>
<p>McIntosh said rotating players on a regular basis was crucial, adding Natal had learnt an important lesson about player depth during this year's Super 12 competition.</p>
<p>He said the hectic playing schedule was also having its affect on the players.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe that you can go through any season with the amount of games we've got now -- both at provincial and international level,&quot; McIntosh said.</p>
<p>&quot;Just take the Springbok schedule this year with the Tri-Nations tournament, the All Black tour to South Africa after the Super 12 competition and now the away tour to Argentina, France and Wales.</p>
<p>&quot;South Africa's last test match is on December 15 -- and we then start training for the Super 12 in January. That's one hectic schedule.&quot;</p>
