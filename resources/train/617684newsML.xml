<p>Times are tough in Tehran's old gold bazaar where merchants complain that business has slumped to its worst in living memory because of the weak Iranian economy and government indifference to the trade.</p>
<p>Tehran's old bazaar, which is decorated with ornate ceramic Persian tiles, hosts nearly 500 small shops. According to bazaar merchants, they offer 18-carat jewellery fashioned from gold mainly smuggled from Dubai, Turkey and Iraq -- as all gold imports have to be approved by the government -- or crafted from recycled local bullion.</p>
<p>Women hidden behind the all-enveloping black chadors peer into shop windows which are filled with necklaces, bangles and rings. But few are buying at prices of 46,000 rials a gram ($15.33 at the official rate or $9.58 on the black market).</p>
<p>&quot;Business is poor because of the general economic situation and because the goverment is suspicious of this profession,&quot; said Mehran, a wholesaler who has worked in the bazaar for 10 years. His father worked for 40 years before him. &quot;It's the toughest time in living memory. The business is simply dying.&quot;</p>
<p>Iran's economy is ravaged by inflation officially put at 25 percent and high unemployment, factors which limit spending by the majority of Iranians who only buy gold for special occasions such as a daughter's wedding or the new year holiday.</p>
<p>But Iran's gold market is significant with traders assessing demand among its 60 million people at around 350 tonnes a year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a safe investment and also it is a custom in Iran to buy gold when people get married...No matter how poor they are, when their daughter gets married they have to buy the bride gold,&quot; said one shopkeeper.</p>
<p>Most families buy over $500 worth of jewellery as a form of dowry but such purchases are not enough to make up for a slump in trade over the past three or four years, shopowners said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade is stagnant because of people's poor purchasing power,&quot; said Hadi, who has run a bazaar shop for 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very meagre, even for weddings,&quot; said Mohammad Talachi, whose family has sold gold in the bazaar for 150 years.</p>
<p>Shopowners also complain the government has done nothing to help the trade and has contributed to the sector's weak state by prohibiting exports and not encouraging foreign tourists.</p>
<p>&quot;The goverment considers our profession as superficial and useless...They think our industry is unproductive,&quot; said a retail shopowner, recalling accusations by officials that gold was a corrupting, speculative activity that damaged the state.</p>
<p>Iranian media have often blamed the merchants for benefiting from speculating in gold when Iran's currency is under pressure.</p>
<p>Only the odd foreign visitor from the former Soviet Union makes the journey to the warren of tiny gold shops now competing against other stalls which sell household goods and clothing.</p>
<p>The government sells gold to the local market and controls hallmarking to ensure standards.</p>
<p>Trade has also been hit by many Iranians putting their spare cash into Tehran's revamped stock exchange which has earned better returns than local gold jewellery and coins.</p>
<p>The growing gold market in Dubai, an Arab emirate across the Gulf, has also taken business away from Tehran with its offers of cheaper bullion and easier import-export regulations.</p>
