<headline>Licht reduces forecast for 96/97 world sugar output.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>World sugar production should reach 123.32 million tonnes raw value in 1996/97, slightly higher than the 123.23 million reported in 1995/96, German statistician F.O. Licht said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The new estimate, Licht's third forecast of 1996/97 production, was lower than the previous figure of 125.30 million released in February and around 3.3 million tonnes below the initial estimate published in October.</p>
<p>Licht said sugar production in the European Union (EU) was expected to be some 960,000 tonnes more than in 1995/96 and amount to 17.97 million tonnes</p>
<p>The cane sugar sector would account for 85.43 million tonnes of total world production, compared with 86.88 million in 1995/96. Sugar output from beet would reach 37.89 million tonnes after a previous 36.35 million.</p>
<p>Brazil would assume top spot this year with 14.67 million tonnes forecast, up by around one million tonnes on the year.</p>
<p>&quot;This puts other producers in South America in the shade, though Colombia is expected to reach 2.1 million tonnes and Argentina 1.4 million tonnes,&quot; Licht said.</p>
<p>It added that various difficulties had been encountered in Cuba, where production was forecast at 4.28 million tonnes after a previous 4.53 million.</p>
<p>But Mexico, another leading producer in the region, would turn out 4.84 million tonnes, up 100,000 tonnes on the year, Licht said.</p>
<p>Asia was likely to be the big loser in terms of sugar production, with India expected to turn out 14.25 million tonnes compared with a bumper 17.88 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>&quot;Thailand's regular increases have also come to a halt with 6.1 million tonnes, raw value, expected compared with 6.3 million tonnes in 1995/96,&quot; Licht said.</p>
<p>Production in Indonesia was also expected to fall and was forecast at 2.10 million tonnes, down from the 2.29 million produced last year and well below either targets or levels attained in the past.</p>
<p>Licht noted that the Philippines, not long ago one of the world's leading sugar exporters, was now an importer with a shortfall of 370,000 tonnes expected next year.</p>
<p>But China was expected to show an improvement in output and turn out 5.84 million tonnes in 1996/97, up from the 5.37 million the previous year.</p>
<p>Licht said Australia was continuing to set new output records while its export potential was striding towards five million tonnes. Sugar production was forecast at 5.62 million tonnes for 1996/97 after 5.13 in 1995/96.</p>
