<p>Argentine stocks crawled to a narrowly higher close Monday as volume shrank to a five-and-a-half year low during the U.S. Labour Day holiday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The long U.S. weekend caused bids to dry up completely, but despite the low turnover seen recently the market now seems to have a fairly steady undertone,&quot; said Jose Napoli of Ignoto y Napoli traders.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index inched up 0.1 percent to 509.98, while floor volume plummeted to 2.4 million pesos -- the lowest tally since February 2, 1991.  </p>
<p>The MerVal gained 1.8 percent last week, paring August losses to 3.7 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the bolsa would probably try to stay immune to growing U.S. interest rate worries Tuesday and instead latch onto local labor reform plans to keep its new positive slant.</p>
<p>The government is designing a new set of laws to make labor conditions more flexible and lower employment costs. Analysts say the package could be a way of appeasing business and industry leaders irked by a package of tax hikes due up this month for debate in Congress.  </p>
<p>At the same time the labor reforms could intensify trade union activism -- workers are planning a 36-hour strike for the end of September.</p>
<p>The bolsa Tuesday will also tune into August inflation and tax collection data, traders said.</p>
<p>In the session the broad market added 0.2 percent, recording only 12 gainers, seven losers and 27 issues closing unchanged.</p>
<p>Floor volume was 2.5 million pesos against 11.8 million Friday, while over-the-counter volume plunged to 7.7 million pesos from 75.7 million Thursday.  </p>
<p>Best main-tier performers were power utility Capex, Telefonica and electricity generator Central Costanera, which advanced 2.3 percent, 1.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Biggest losses were in foods giant Molinos and Banco de Galicia, both off 1.0 percent.</p>
