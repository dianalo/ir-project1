<p>The controversial July closure of French car maker Renault SA's Vilvoorde plant in Belgium could be put off by a few weeks or months, depending on negotiations with unions, chairman Louis Schweitzer said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Schweitzer told RTL radio in an interview that there was no question of overturning the decision to close down the plant to tackle overcapacity and rising costs, but he could be somewhat flexible about the date.</p>
<p>&quot;The scheduled date is still July 31, but there is some flexibility. The social dialogue with our Belgian partners could somewhat change the schedule,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A few weeks, perhaps a few months,&quot; he said, when asked about the possible delay.</p>
<p>Negotiations will cover terms and conditions of the mass dismissal of the workers.</p>
<p>A majority of the 3,100 workers at the plant, near Brussels, voted last week to halt their five-week strike against the plant's impending closure, a move analysts see as part of a strategy to begin lengthy negotiations.</p>
<p>Unions have slammed Renault's decision, which they say broke Belgian, French and European Union labour laws since the company failed to inform and consult workers adequately.</p>
<p>Belgian and French courts have ruled the closure procedure followed by Renault was illegal and ordered the company to play it by the book, handing the unions a moral victory.</p>
<p>After the court rulings, which Renault has said it is appealing, unions decided to take legal action to force the company to pay out wages to the workers for the duration of the strike since formally they had remained on the Renault payroll.</p>
<p>It is unclear how long any talks on the terms and conditions of the closure could take. The court appeals could take until the end of April, and only then would the procedure start.</p>
