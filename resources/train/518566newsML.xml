<headline>Kinkel says Iran should &quot;see reason&quot; over verdict.</headline>

<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Thursday Iran should &quot;once again&quot; show respect for international law and return to a policy of more openness towards Europe to enable future dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;I appeal to Iran to see reason, to once more observe international law and a policy which will enable us to resume future dialogue -- in its own interests,&quot; Kinkel said.</p>
<p>The German foreign minister was speaking in a parliamentary debate on a German court verdict that Iran's political leaders ordered political killings in Berlin.</p>
<p>Kinkel said that although Germany and the rest of the European Union had ended its policy of &quot;critical dialogue&quot; with Iran, limited communications lines would remain open since it was in no one's interests to sever links entirely.</p>
<p>Kinkel praised the Berlin court which convicted and jailed three Lebanese and an Iranian last Thursday for the 1992 murder of four Kurdish dissidents in the city and concluded that Iranian leaders had ordered the killings.</p>
<p>In a letter to Kinkel on Wednesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati denounced the verdict which has sparked violent protests by thousands of Islamic fundamentalist students outside the German embassy in Tehran.</p>
<p>The verdict marked the first time a European court had clearly attributed political responsibility for any of the dozens of assassinations of Iranian opposition figures abroad since the Islamic revolution in 1979.</p>
