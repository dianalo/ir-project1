<p>Indian car maker PAL-Peugeot Ltd, hurt by a prolonged labour dispute at its suburban Bombay plant, said it was optimistic for the future despite facing growing competition in the sector.</p>
<p>Top officials said late on Wednesday that PAL-Peugeot, a joint venture of Premier Automobiles Ltd and Automobiles Peugeot of France, would lift a month-long lockout at its Kalyan plant some time next week.</p>
<p>They said the company suspended operations at the plant on August 2 and locked out employees 14 days later after workers refused to raise the output of Peugeot 309 cars to 20 units per shift as required by the existing settlement.</p>
<p>The lockout followed three months of failed negotiations with the factory's union over increasing production of Peugeot cars, officials said. Datta Samant, head of the Association of Engineering Workers, the union at PAL-Peugeot, claimed that the levels of indigenisation of the Peugeot 309 were not moving fast enough and that management was trying to cut jobs. The management denies both counts.</p>
<p>&quot;They even introduced the PAL-Peugeot car without any agreement from the union,&quot; Samant told Reuters.</p>
<p>Indigenisation, referring to the proportion of locally made parts, was expected to touch 50 percent by March 1997 against the current 31 percent, Deputy managing director J. Manlay said.</p>
<p>He said workers had to realise that India's car market was becoming increasingly competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;Workers have to understand if we are not able to produce the right model at the right time, we are going to lose out,&quot; Manlay told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;They must realise that with all this competition, things have to change. Previously, with two models to choose from, customers were ready to wait, but today all models of cars are available off the shelf,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>For years, Indian consumers had to choose between the lumbering Ambassador car from Hindustan Motors and the sturdy, no-nonsense Premier Padmini model from PAL.</p>
<p>After India opened its auto sector in 1992 -- as part of its gradual conversion to a free-market economy -- several global car makers announced plans to set up shop. Auto giants like Ford, Daewoo, General Motors, Peugeot, Fiat and Daimler-Benz have already launched models through Indian joint ventures.</p>
<p>&quot;When you see the competition producing cars, you feel frustrated but you have to be optimistic,&quot; Manlay said.</p>
<p>PAL-Peugeot officials said the management would lift the lockout for those workers who were willing to rejoin after signing an individual undertaking.</p>
<p>&quot;For Peugeot France, this factory is a key player in our operations. We consider it (the dispute) an accident that should be over very soon,&quot; Manlay said.</p>
<p>Vice-president of marketing N. Shimpi said around 60,000 bookings for the Peugeot 309 have been cancelled since February with 40,000 bookings still pending.</p>
<p>Manlay said PAL-Peugeot has so far released 1,750 cars with an additional 250 units sold but still in the plant.</p>
<p>He said PAL-Peugeot would make up for lost time by increasing the speed of indigenisation of the car.</p>
