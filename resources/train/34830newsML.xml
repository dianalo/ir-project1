<p>Asian rice prices were mainly firmer this week with supply limited ahead of the Indian harvest in October and despite buyers holding back as they expect the market to ease in coming weeks, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has basically bottomed out,&quot; one Vietnamese trader said. &quot;Traders have started to buy, partly because the Indian crop is not really in the market yet.&quot;</p>
<p>In Thailand, rice prices have firmed slightly in the past two weeks as only a small quantity of fresh supplies have entered a quiet market, local trade sources said.  </p>
<p>The Thai benchmark 100 percent white B rice for September/October shipment was quoted at betwen $345-$355 a tonne FOB Bangkok compared with $335 two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Buyers have slowed purchases as they await expected easier prices in coming weeks, the sources said.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the recent drop in supply partly to recent heavy monsoon rain.</p>
<p>&quot;A big amount of paddy was dampened by rain. So, millers had to slow down activity because rice breaks when you mill it while it is damp,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>At Bangkok port, ships were loading about 40,000 tonnes of rice for various destinations, industry sources said.</p>
<p>These included 4,000 tonnes of fragrant rice to China and 6,130 tonnes of 100 percent rice to Malaysia. A further 5,100 tonnes were also headed for Japan and 8,000 tonnes to Nigeria, and the rest to unidentified destinations.</p>
<p>A Thai agriculture ministry official said there were no plans to sharply revise the national forecast for rice production despite the ongoing rains, adding that revised crop output forecasts would be detailed later this month.  </p>
<p>According to official projections in July, rice output for the first crop of 1996/97 (April-March) was put at 18.11 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, the rice market has held steady in the last week underpinned by fears that recent flooding in the north may have damaged the paddy crop, traders said.</p>
<p>They said five percent broken grade has been trading at around $275-280 a tonne FOB Saigon port for the past month.</p>
<p>Higher brokens have recovered from a recent bout of weakness on talk that non-export grade rice could be headed for the flood-hit north of the country.  </p>
<p>&quot;People are talking about flooding in the northern areas,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It's more psychological really. I don't think there's much damage.&quot;</p>
<p>He shrugged off speculation that China was in the market for Vietnamese rice because of flood damage to its crop.</p>
<p>Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture has asked for the export quota this year to be increased to 2.3-2.5 million tonnes from two million in 1995.</p>
<p>Traders said recent trade buying suggested that shipments would pick up in the weeks ahead. One said 10 vessels, bound for Africa and the Middle East, were now loading in Saigon port.  </p>
<p>Indian officials and analysts said they anticipate a good domestic rice crop this year, helped by plentiful monsoon rains, but exports are likely to dip from record levels due to a fall in world demand and uncompetitive prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Rice exports are not going to pick up due to a fall in international demand,&quot; Anil Adlakha, executive director of the All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA), told Reuters.</p>
<p>Harvesting of the new rice crop will start in October.</p>
<p>Analysts said India was expected to harvest around 70 million tonnes of rice in October, the same as last year.  </p>
<p>India produced around 81 million tonnes of rice in the 1995/96 (July-June) crop year, with most of it covering domestic needs. The government has set a target of nearly 80 million tonnes for 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;Indian exports this year will be a maximum of three million tonnes as Indian prices are much higher than Vietnam's prices,&quot; said Prem Garg, a leading foodgrains exporter.</p>
<p>India exported a record five million tonnes of rice in the year that ended in March. It was the largest exporter of rice in the year after Thailand.  </p>
