<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>Dutch bonds slid into the close on Wednesday, after staying firm through most of the session, as a rapid pullback in U.S. Treasury futures fed through into the local market, dealers said.</p>
<p>But traders were encouraged at the higher levels of trade seen after a recent quiet period.</p>
<p>&quot;We seem to be back in business again,&quot; one said. &quot;I did a lot of trades today.&quot;</p>
<p>With no major data to focus on, the market forged ahead through most of the the day, supported by buoyant Bund futures, but had turned heavy by the late afternoon.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely starting to look a little toppy and there wasn't much resistance when it started to push lower,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Austria's 30-year guilder eurobond issue in the morning had drawn a lot of attention, he said.</p>
<p>The 1.0 billion guilder issue can be converted into an Austrian Bund when the country joins EMU and redenominates into euros if the Netherlands joins EMU.</p>
<p>Lead manager ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said there was pent-up demand for both the credit, well regarded by Dutch investors, and the maturity.  </p>
<p>The bond was priced at 14 basis points over the 30-year State Loan and had indeed gone down well in the market, a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very nice issue and the market digested it with no problems at all,&quot; he said.</p>
