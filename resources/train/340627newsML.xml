<p>Rains were heading for Brazil's key soybean growing region of Rio Grande do Sul overnight and could alleviate the dryness which has affected some spots, a weather forecaster said.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) said the region should become cloudy today and would see generalised rains of 15 to 20 mm between Jan 30 and Feb 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Tonight there is rain forecast for the whole of Rio Grande do Sul,&quot; said weather forecaster Yvanete Ledo. &quot;It is set to rain the whole day on Jan 30 and it will continue on Jan 31 and Feb 1, mainly in the north and east.&quot;</p>
<p>Growers said rains had been patchy in the last 10 days but most thought it was too early to talk of crop losses.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently we don't consider ourselves to be in a situation of drought,&quot; said Paulo Renato Mafsini at the Cotriba cooperative in Ibiruba. &quot;We had 60 to 65 mm of rain about two weeks ago which really favoured the development of the soybean crop,&quot; he said. &quot;Since then it hasn't rained and temperatures have been high.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Conditions are relatively normal. Another one or two weeks like this would not be a problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But a technician at the Cotrijal cooperatibve in Nao-Me-Toque said that even though dryness was localised, productivity was set to drop in some areas.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a drop in productivity to 35 bags per hectare from 42 bags per hectare last year,&quot; he said.</p>
