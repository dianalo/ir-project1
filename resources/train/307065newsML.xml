<p>Germany's tax reform commission has outlined a plan to lower the top income tax rate to 39 percent from 53 percent, newspapers reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A member of the commission said the lowest tax bracket would fall to under 20 percent from the current 26 percent, the business daily Handelsblatt said.</p>
<p>The Bild Zeitung tabloid reported the top rate would fall to 40 percent.</p>
<p>The plan, which falls short of Bonn's previously stated goal of cutting the top rate to 35 percent, also includes a one percent increase in the country's value-added tax, sources told Reuters after the commission met on Monday.</p>
<p>Reductions in taxes on income, corporate profits and interest should reduce the tax load by some 70 billion marks. The commission has already agreed to scrap 33 billion marks in tax breaks to partly offset the cuts.</p>
<p>A one percent rise in the value-added tax would raise another 15 billion marks to help close the gap.</p>
<p>The tax reform commission of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition met on Monday to hammer out some of the final details of a broad reform of Germany's heavy tax burden. The final proposal is due on January 23.  </p>
<p>Kohl is banking on tax reform to cut tax evasion and lift an economy plagued by record unemployment.</p>
