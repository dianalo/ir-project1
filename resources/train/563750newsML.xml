<p>Helsinki shares were seen opening</p>
<p>higher on Tuesday and rising some two percent or even more for</p>
<p>the day after the Dow ended at a new all-time high close in New</p>
<p>York overnight, brokers said.</p>
<p>Some brokers expected the bourse to jump at the opening.</p>
<p>&quot;We will rise at least two percent at the start,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Others were more cautious, but even then predicted the HEX</p>
<p>index would rise by close to two percent for the day.</p>
<p>Forestries and Nokia were likely to lead shares</p>
<p>higher after overnight gains in the U.S., brokers said.</p>
<p>Engineering group Rauma's first quarter profit was</p>
<p>in line with forecasts and brokers said the share could rise as</p>
<p>UPM-Kymmene's move to reduce its stake in Rauma was expected to</p>
<p>boost liquidity in the share and make it more attractive.</p>
<p>Data systems group TT Tieto was seen rising on its</p>
<p>Q1 profit that was near the top of the range of analysts'</p>
<p>forecasts, brokers said.</p>
<p>Sporting equipment and tobacco group Amer was</p>
<p>suspended pending a release at 1300/1000 GMT.</p>
<p>Brokers said Rautaruukki was likely to be in focus</p>
<p>with the 13 million shares sold in its share offering being</p>
<p>traded on the bourse for the first day.</p>
