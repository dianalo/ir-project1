<p>A Chicago expert on exotic birds has been sentenced to 82 months in jail for heading an international parrot smuggling ring, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tony Silva was sentenced in federal court on Monday to the longest U.S. prison term ever handed out for bird smuggling, the department said in a statement. Silva, 36, is an internationally prominent writer and lecturer on the plight of endangered parrots in the wild.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty on Jan. 30 to a broad conspiracy involving his mother and others to smuggle into the United States hundreds of rare birds trapped in the wild in South America, the department said.</p>
<p>Among the birds, valued at more than $1.3 million altogether, were dozens of hyacinth macaws, an endangered species of which no more than 5,000 are estimated to survive in Brazil, the department said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is disgraceful that a person of Mr. Silva's stature in the avicultural community has engaged in activity that proved directly fatal to many hyacinth macaws and other highly endangered species,&quot; James Burns, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, said.</p>
<p>Silva also pleaded guilty to filing a false income tax return in connection with the sale of birds.</p>
