<p>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp said it agreed to a four-year transition to competition, including the separation of the utility's fossil-fuel generation plants from its transmission and distribution operations.</p>
<p>A spokesman on Tuesday said the agreement would allow the company to maintain its return on equity at 10.6 percent.</p>
<p>The agreement, reached Thursday with the staff of the New York State Public Service Commission and the Department of Economic Development, also calls for a 5.0 percent rate cut for the utility's largest industrial customers.  </p>
<p>The proposal would allow other business and residential customers to choose their power supplier beginning next year.</p>
<p>Central Hudson said the agreement resulted from negotiations on its October 1996 response to the commission's Competitive Opportunities Proceeding.</p>
<p>At that time, the utility proposed a three-year transition to competition with stable prices while exploring opportunities to offer discounts to its largest industrial and commercial customers in return for their commitment to maintain their business in the area.  </p>
<p>The October filing did not address restructuring and called for retention of a vertically integrated structure.</p>
<p>The agreement filed with the commission calls for base electric rates for all but Central Hudson's largest customers to be frozen through June 30, 2001, the utility said.</p>
<p>The filing begins a public review process that is expected to end with commission consideration in July.</p>
<p>It calls for a Retail Access Option for residential, commercial and small industrial customers to be in place no later than next year and to be phased in to all customers beyond the year 2001, the company said.</p>
