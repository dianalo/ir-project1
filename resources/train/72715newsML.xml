<p>United Airlines said it will restart its non-stop flight Hong Kong and Chicago in 1997 after a better than anticipated first summer season.</p>
<p>The 16-hour-long Boeing 747-400 flights over 7,788 miles which began three times weekly on July 15, end in October for the winter due to low seasonal demand and potentially severe winds over the North Pole, the airline said.</p>
<p>Chris Bowers, United's senior vice president International told Reuters in a telephone interview from United's headquarters in Chicago that the flights have been popular and will return.</p>
<p>&quot;The airplane has been doing better than we anticipated and has become very popular with business fliers because of the time savings. It took some time for it to catch on because its a new route and it is the longest flight in the world but its performing better than we anticipated.</p>
<p>He said the airline is still assessing exactly when the service will restart.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a question of if we will do it again, it's a question of when we restart,&quot; Bowers said.</p>
<p>United say they expect Asia-Pacific to remain the fastest growing market and remain bullish about the Hong Kong market.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the Pacific continuing to grow at a greater rate than the North American or European markets and that's why we are trying to put additional resources into Asia Pacific to upgrade and improve,&quot; Bowers said.</p>
<p>He also said United will be offering more air cargo capacity and passenger comfort when ageing Boeing 747-100/200s and McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 airliners are retired.</p>
<p>They will be replaced by 19 higher capacity Boeing 747-400 jets on United's Asia Pacific network between 1998 and 2001.</p>
<p>United also said they have identified Guangzhou, in southern China and Kuala Lumpur as potential new Asian destinations, but Bowers said these are subject to government approval and were a long way off realisation.</p>
<p>He added that discussions between the U.S. and Japanese government still have not been finalised to allow United to begin a new service from San Francisco to Jakarta via Osaka.</p>
