<p>Taiwan's overseas investment, excluding that in mainland China, fell 50 percent between January and March to US$360.554 million from the same period in 1996, the Investment Commision said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investment in &quot;other&quot; unspecified regions totalled $214.468 million, followed by investment in the United States which rose 12 percent to $50.185 million.</p>
<p>The government's &quot;south-bound&quot; policy received a boost, with more Taiwan businesses investing in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Worried that its businessmen could become too dependent on China, Taiwan launched the policy in late 1993 to promote investment in Southeast Asia instead of the mainland.</p>
<p>Investment in Vietnam jumped 73 percent to $37.686 million, followed by investment in Indonesia, which leapt sharply from only $105,000 to $22.857 million.</p>
<p>Basic metal and metal manufacturing industries topped the list of Taiwan companies investing overseas, with a total of $75.917 million, followed by international trade with $75.645 million and financial and insurance industries with $52.964 million.</p>
<p>The commission approved a total of US$275 million worth of Taiwanese indirect investment in China in 78 projects between January and March, up 7.44 percent from the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Foreign investment in Taiwan rose 28 percent to US$426.649 million in the first three months of 1997 from the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>Investment from &quot;other&quot; unspecified regions increased 51 percent to $137.128 million, followed by investment from the United States, which was up 58 percent to $71.452 million.</p>
<p>European investment gained 50 percent to $41.683 million, while investment from Japan rose 16 percent to $21.750 million.</p>
