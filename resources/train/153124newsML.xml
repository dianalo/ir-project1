<p>Russia's Federal Bankruptcy Agency, in a get-tough approach to debtor firms, is reviewing the financial state of Russia's entire electricity and oil industries, agency head Pyotr Mostovoi said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mostovoi told a news conference that comprehensive reviews of the two sectors had come at the behest of the cabinet and the government's emergency commission to improve tax collection.</p>
<p>He said oil group NK Sidanko's production unit AO Varyoganneftegaz had debts of 114 billion roubles, Sibneft's main production unit AO Noyabrskneftegaz owed 386 billion, and Tyumenskaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya's AO Nizhnevartovskneftegaz production unit owed 1.1 trillion roubles.</p>
<p>Their debts were calculated on the basis of Tax Inspectorate figures and do not include payments in kind made to help bring in the harvest or fund other federal programmes, he said.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy proceedings are part of the government's latest -- and toughest -- efforts to improve its dismal performance on tax collection.</p>
<p>Officials, determined to increase tax revenue in order to win the next tranche of a $10 billion three-year IMF loan, have also promised to make company managers personally responsible if their firms do not pay their bills on time.</p>
<p>But Mostovoi said the government of the autonomous region of Tatarstan was set to pay the tax debts of truckmaker KamAZ, another prominent company originally black-listed as a candidate for bankruptcy due to debts of 50.9 trillion roubles.</p>
<p>Local president Mintimer Shaimiyev had warned Russian officials that he was not prepared to tolerate bankruptcy proceedings against companies in Tatarstan.</p>
<p>Mostovoi said officials had investigated 2,917 enterprises across Russia and found 839 of them bankrupt over the first nine months of 1996.</p>
<p>But courts have stepped up the number of indictments designed to collect tax arrears by 50 percent this year, collecting 1.19 billion roubles for the federal budget and 1.18 billion roubles owed to governmental, non-budget organisations.</p>
<p>The Krasnodarnefteorgsintez oil refinery, run by state oil holding firm Rosneft, is also on the government's debtor's list.</p>
<p>Two major oil companies -- Tatneft and Rosneft's Purneftegaz -- were threatened with bankruptcy but have been cleared after paying off some tax arrears and debts in barter payments.</p>
<p>Many industry analysts say Russia is unlikely to actually liquidate oil enterprises, whose exports provide the lion's share of Russia's foreign exchange earnings and whose vast numbers of employees, if jobless, would be a burden to the economy.</p>
