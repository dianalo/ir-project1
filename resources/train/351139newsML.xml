<p>Japan and the European Union (EU) have formally agreed to changes in taxes on imported liquor, finally settling one of their longest-running trade disputes, the Ministry of Finance announced on Monday.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said Japan agreed to raise taxes on domestic spirits known as &quot;shochu&quot; -- a potent colourless liquor made mainly from barley -- and lower those on liqueur and &quot;white&quot; spirits such as vodka from overseas, so that they are all at the same tax rate.</p>
<p>Japan also agreed to cut the tax difference between shochu and whiskey to just three percent from the present range of 394.3 percent to 601.3 percent.</p>
<p>The changes will all be carried out by October 2001.</p>
<p>The statement said Japan also promised to make bigger cuts in tariffs on whiskey and brandy, including Scotch whisky, from October 1998 to March 2002.</p>
<p>The World Trade Organisation gave the impetus for the settlement when it decided last November, ruling on a complaint by the EU, the United States and Canada, that Japan taxes imported spirits unfairly compared with domestic liquor.</p>
<p>Japan has not yet agreed with the United States and Canada on liquor tax revisions. Negotiations with Washington broke off without results and the issue is set to be discussed at the WTO soon.</p>
<p>In the agreement with the EU, Japan promised that any additional reduction in tariffs which may be agreed with the United States and Canada will also apply to the EU.</p>
<p>Japan and the EU had already reached a basic agreement in December but the formal agreement took place on January 31, the ministry statement said.</p>
<p>Initial proposals by Tokyo included only the tax revisions, but the tariff reduction was added after Japan proposed reducing tariffs on bourbon whiskey in its negotiations with the United States, a ministry official said.</p>
