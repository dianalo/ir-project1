<headline>UK report stirs controversy over Nazi gold.</headline>

<p>Britain on Tuesday revived speculation over the fate of gold looted by Nazi Germany by disclosing that Switzerland turned over to Allied powers only a small part of the gold it acknowledged buying in World War Two.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office said in a report the sum of 250 million Swiss francs (about $60 million) paid in 1946 to settle claims connected with Nazi gold was little more than a tenth of the gold thought to be in Swiss bank vaults at the end of the war.</p>
<p>The ministry, citing a published U.S. government account, said the director of the Swiss National Bank had let slip during post-war negotiations with the Allies that Swiss banks held $500 million when the war ended -- $6.5 billion at today's prices.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind ordered the report following pressure from Member of Parliament Greville Janner, a leading member of the Jewish community who has been campaigning on behalf of potential claimants of stolen gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Rivers of gold flowed out of Nazi Germany, and the banks of that river are in Switzerland,&quot; Janner told a news conference.</p>
<p>He welcomed the report, which was compiled from published diplomatic documents and public archives, and called on Switzerland to return the gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Switzerland now has a moral obligation to think again about restoring gold reserves, now worth billions, to the countries from which they were seized,&quot; Janner said.</p>
<p>He said the 1946 agreement, under which the Allies waived further claims against Switzerland, amounted to no more than a licence to redistribute looted gold, much of it believed stolen from Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that even now our Swiss friends will do justice to the survivors of Nazi atrocities,&quot; Janner said.</p>
<p>Officials said Rifkind would tell Swiss ministers of the depth of feeling in Britain over the issue, especially among Jewish groups, when he pays a previously scheduled visit to Switzerland next week.</p>
<p>But a Swiss official made it clear the matter was regarded as closed.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know at this moment what amounts were involved, but the whole question was settled in the treaty between the Allies and Switzerland,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Switzerland has to adhere to something. We cannot say now that (agreement) is invalid,&quot; he added. &quot;We recognise that this may be of historical interest, but from a legal standpoint there is not much leeway (to change the accord).&quot;</p>
<p>The Foreign Office said Switzerland acknowledged buying $415 million in German gold from 1939-45 and $88 million traceable originally to Belgium, but refused to concede that this was the amount they should turn over to the Allies.</p>
<p>It said the United States, Britain and France accepted the sum of 250 million Swiss francs because they felt they had little alternative.</p>
<p>&quot;This sum, far less than the $130 million asked for by the Allied negotiators, was presented by the Swiss delegation as its final offer. The Swiss maintained consistently that Switzerland could not be held liable to restore the entire amount of looted gold transferred from Germany to Switzerland, some of which was transferred to third countries,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The archive search cast no light on claims of a secret deal with Switzerland to share out cash raised by selling the booty.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no secret deals in this,&quot; a Foreign Office official said.</p>
<p>The report concludes that the Allies did their best to recover as much Nazi gold as they could but admits that speculation as to how much remains undiscovered continues.</p>
<p>&quot;There is much... which we still do not know and on which the British documents shed no light,&quot; Rifkind said in a letter to Janner accompanying the report. &quot;Many secrets were, doubtless, buried with their Nazi keepers.&quot;</p>
