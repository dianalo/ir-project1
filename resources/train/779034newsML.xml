<p>U.S. money managers were more bullish with their debt portfolios over the past week, slightly increasing their duration exposure, according to an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey.</p>
<p>Durations as a percentage of benchmark inched up to 108.2 percent in the week ended August 4, from 108.1 in the previous week.</p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market.</p>
<p>A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.  </p>
<p>In addition, cash levels fell and mortgages weighting continued to flag, said MCM MoneyWatch economist Astrid Adolfson, who conducts the weekly survey.</p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 3.19 percent from 3.24 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>In the &quot;next likely move&quot; category, portfolio managers representing 40 percent of total assets in the survey indicated they would &quot;buy,&quot; down from 41 percent the prior week.</p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward &quot;sell&quot; rose to 11 percent from 10 percent the previous week.  </p>
<p>Forty-nine percent of managers said they were &quot;neutral&quot; on the market, unchanged from the prior week.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, down from 41 percent in the previous week. Seven percent underweighted the sector for the third consecutive week, while the remaining 55 percent were &quot;neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 42 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 20 percent underweighted them.  </p>
<p>The survey included 38 domestic participants who manage about $110 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday.  </p>
