<title>UK: LME copper breaches support, nickel, tin slide.</title>
<headline>LME copper breaches support, nickel, tin slide.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>LME copper prices crumbled below $2,100 support on Monday afternoon as spreads eased and ahead of inventory data expected to show more metal in exchange warehouses.</p>
<p>Many of the other metals joined the slide with tin hitting fresh 19-month lows and nickel touching a new 26-month nadir.</p>
<p>Three months copper ended the afternoon kerb at $2,081 per tonne, down $51 from Friday and only $1 off the low for the day.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we're going to see softer prices now that the tight December dates are mostly out of the way,&quot; said one senior floor trader.</p>
<p>The premium of cash over three months metal eased again after third Wednesday pricing went smoothly in the morning, disappointing some who had expected some volatility.</p>
<p>It was last indicated at a $55 backwardation compared to a $100 backwardation on Friday.</p>
<p>Floor traders said they expected LME inventories to rise again on Tuesday after a build of 7,225 tonnes on Friday.</p>
<p>Several traders said they expected stocks to rise by 8,000-10,000 tonnes, although one trader thought they could increase as much as 12,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Nickel dropped to its weakest since October 1994, as three months metal ended the kerb at its day's low of $6,510, a loss of $125.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the confirmed breach of $6,600 support, where it bottomed out on November 18, weakened the chart picture and made further falls to $6,400 likely.</p>
<p>Tin slipped to a low of $5,680, the lowest since May 12, 1995, but it edged up slightly by the end of the day to $5,685, a loss of $90.</p>
<p>The market had been hit by fund liquidation recently and soft technicals, traders said.</p>
<p>Aluminium, however, ignored the weakness in the others and managed to gain $6 to $1,516 after exploring a low of $1,507.</p>
<p>Zinc eased $8 to $1,045 and trade was light in lead, which finished indicated at $689/90, down slightly from $695 on Friday.</p>
<p>Alloy was indicated at $1,357/60 versus $1,365.</p>
