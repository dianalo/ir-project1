<p>Australian bond yields finished above the day's lows as the market absorbed today's A$600 million T-bond tender, but it is seen well placed to maintain the current rally, traders said.</p>
<p>The tender was well bid as expected, which was seen underpinning the largely technical move since the fall to a contract low on June 10-year bond futures at 91.700 in after hours trading last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Futures are still in good shape, if not a little overdone, but I'm still bearish on the U.S., which is going to reflect on us again at some stage,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>The next key data event for the local market will be Thursday's labour force report, which is expected to show only moderate employment growth and keep unemployment above 8.5 percent, economists said.</p>
<p>The market is also still waiting for a decision on the national &quot;living wage&quot; claim, but the timing of the outcome still remains clouded in uncertainty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Treasurer Peter Costello said the report on the Wallis inquiry into Australian financial system will be released on Wednesday at 12.00 p.m. (0200 GMT).  </p>
<p>&quot;Wallis is obviously an important report, but it is not going to have an immediate impact on the bond market,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Today's tender was seen as a good guide to current demand given that the rally over the past week has been largely techncial, although analysts have been aware of offshore demand in recent days from Asia, including Korea, China and Japan.</p>
<p>There has also been some switching from Canada which has been under pressure from the threat of a weak Canadian dollar due to prospects of a further tightening by the Federal Reserve next month, although this market partly bounced back on Monday.</p>

<p>The local market also gave up some ground against the U.S. on the day after its recent strong outperformance, but differentials still remain below their recent highs. Some analysts see the 10-year spread narrowing to 100 basis points if the employment report proves subdued.</p>
