<p>Mexico's largest mining company Grupo Mexico (GMexico) should see an expansion of its La Caridad copper smelter at full capacity inside three months, analysts said Monday.</p>
<p>Despite delays in the start-up of the expansion to 300,000 tonnes per year from 180,000 tonnes, the smelter is in a pre-operational phase and will be fully operational in three months, they said, citing company officials.  </p>
<p>The smelter expansion was originally planned to be eased on line in November. Company officials were not immediately available for direct comment.</p>
<p>Valores Finamex analyst Christopher Albi said that copper and zinc shipments were down in the first quarter of the year, resulting in lower sales. The copper problem, he said, was a temporary bottleneck caused by the delayed start-up of the La Caridad smelter.  </p>
<p>&quot;This caused a build-up of inventories, both concentrates and finished product. But with the smelter now ready to go, copper shipments should at least return to normal and possibly make up for lost ground in the second quarter,&quot; Albi said.</p>
<p>Copper sales volume in three first quarter was 73,779 tonnes, down 7.8 percent against the 80,015 tonnes in the first quarter of 1996 and off 9.8 percent from the 81,784 tonnes sold in the final quarter of 1996, the company said.  </p>
<p>Also, despite the negative general outlook for copper prices in the medium term, Santander Investment analyst Sandra Morfin said the brokerage's outlook for GMexico was that it was significantly undervalued as an equity play.</p>
<p>&quot;GMexico will benefit from its very competitive all-in cash cost of about 49 cents/lb of copper,&quot; Morfin said in an update.</p>
<p>&quot;Our only concern continues to be Asarco's 16 percent stake in the company that could be sold into the market at any time,&quot; she added.  </p>
<p>U.S. mining giant Asarco has made no secret of the fact it wants to offload the stake in GMexico, either in a private placement, offering to markets, or buy-out by GMexico. But the two have been at loggerheads over price.</p>
