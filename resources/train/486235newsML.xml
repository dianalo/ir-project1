<headline>Hyundai Motor to cut production hours.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>South Korea's largest carmaker Hyundai Motor Co will reduce vehicle production by four hours a day from April 8 to 12, a company spokesman said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Line workers will not work overtime for five days as we need to realign assembly lines to produce more Tiburones and Avantes, which are major export models,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The company earlier said it was considering cutting production because of rising inventory.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision will also help reduce our inventory,&quot; the spokesman added. Hyundai's inventories totalled about 50,000 vehicles at end-March. No comparative figures were given.</p>
<p>Hyundai Motor currently runs assembly lines for 20 hours a day, including four hours of overtime work.  </p>
<p>Hyundai's vehicle sales in March fell 7.6 percent to 101,957 units from 110,329 a year earlier. Demestic vehicle sales fell 16.2 percent to 50,383 in the month.</p>
<p>The reduction in work hours would cut inventories by 3,100 units, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>A Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association official said vehicle inventories by South Korean carmakers hit a high last month, far outpacing previous record of 100,000 units. No exact figure was given.</p>
<p>Two other major South Korean carmakers -- Kia Motors Corp and Daewoo Motor Co -- said they had no plan to reduce working hours.</p>
