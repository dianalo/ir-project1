<p>Russian national power company UES plans to convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on August 26 to discuss issuing convertible bonds, a senior company official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The board of directors will take a decision on July 22 on calling an extraordinary general meeting on the issue of convertible bonds,&quot; securities accounting director Vera Redko told Reuters. &quot;It is prelimarily planned for August 26.&quot;  </p>
<p>She did not say what quantity of shares could be covered by the convertible bonds, although company officials have said that 1.5 to five percent of shares, including up to about 2.7 percent of company shares held by the government, could be used.</p>
<p>She confirmed earlier statements by company and government officials that the government, which owns 52.7 percent of UES, Russia's largest company by sales and the key to the electricity sector, would keep a controlling stake. UES officials have said this could be as little as 50 percent plus one share.</p>
<p>Redko said the meeting, if held, would vote on giving up existing shareholders' right of first refusal to buy new shares. Giving up that right is a prerequisite for issuing the convertible bonds.</p>
<p>UES investor relations head Pavel Shabanov has said UES capital includes 15 percent of authorised but unissued shares and that one plan for the convertible bond was for the government to put up a 2.7 percent minus one share stake and UES to put up a 2.3 percent stake of authorised shares.</p>
