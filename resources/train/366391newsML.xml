<headline>FOCUS-Eurobourses end mixed, dollar holds gains.</headline>

<p>European bourses fell back somewhat at the end of the day on Monday under the influence of a weaker Wall Street after London, Frankfurt and Paris hit record trading highs.</p>
<p>Frankfurt closed bourse trading sharply higher at a new record before New York trading began. But London ended flat and well down from its record trading peaks of the day with sentiment blunted when an opening Wall Street rally faded. U.S. blue chips were 17 points down at 6,838 when most European bourses closed.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse, which had been less ebullient, turned negative at the end with sentiment damped by New York.</p>
<p>	 On currency markets the dollar ended the European session</p>
<p>on firm note after traders digested weekend comments from finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations (G7) and pulled the U.S. unit up from overnight lows.</p>
<p>The G7 said in statement that the dollar's upward correction over the past two years was now complete and it called for more market stability.</p>
<p>Traders said the comments may increase the risk of extending the dollar's gains sharply from here but they did nothing to alter the economic and interest rate arguments in favour of further dollar strength.</p>
<p>&quot;The G7 did get across its worries about the speed of the dollar's gains but ultimately there's nothing in here to change the direction and that is still for a higher dollar,&quot; said Henry Wilkes, senior trader at Bank Julius Baer.</p>
<p>At 1645 GMT, the dollar was trading at  1.6560 marks compared with an overnight low in the Far East at 1.6350 and an opening rate in Europe at 1.6545.</p>
<p>Against the yen, it was at  122.75 compared with an overnight low at 120.40 and a European open at 122.90.</p>
<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, speaking in Basle on Monday, said markets reacted appropriately to the G7 meeting. One place G7 signals on reining in the dollar were appreciated was Japan, which has grown increasingly worried about the dollar's sharp climb against the yen -- a massive 55 percent in less than two years.</p>
<p>On the equity front, London Dealers said profit-taking was dampening rises at the current high levels of the FTSE index -- which ended down just 0.1 of a point at 4,307.7 -- and trading had been edgy.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the FTSE is above 4,300 people are a bit nervous. It's not too surprising that we're seeing a few people lock in some profits,&quot; the head of trading at a large investment bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Wall Street that has got us down -- what else?&quot; said one market-maker of the late decline.</p>
<p>Earlier, the FTSE 100 climbed to a record peak at 4,330.0, buoyed by another dose of bid speculation, benign UK inflation figures and a solid performance on Wall Street on Friday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt German shares ended bourse trade sharply higher before Wall Street opened. The main German DAX index of floor trading closed at a record 3,184.36 points, up 46.35. After New York opened for business the IBIS DAX index of electronic trading continued to firm and closed well above its previous highest level.</p>
<p>Trading was more subdued on the Paris bourse which, like London, was still open when Wall Street turned negative. The man CAC-40 index closed down 2.15 at 2595.37 after being up about a quarter of a percentage point in mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1645 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6560 marks and 122.75 yen compared with 1.6725 marks and 124.45 yen in late European trading on Friday.</p>
