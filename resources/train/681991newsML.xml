<title>AUSTRALIA: Resources drag Australian stocks to weaker close.</title>
<headline>Resources drag Australian stocks to weaker close.</headline>

<p>The Australian share market ended a lacklustre session slightly weaker on Monday after a fall in the price of gold put pressure on the resources sector.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed 6.3 points lower at 2,706.3 after touching an intra-day low of 2,701.0.</p>
<p>The June share price index finished three points down at 2,719 and at a 12.7 point premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Leading the market lower were Australia's two largest resource issues, The Broken Hill Pty Co and Rio Tinto , both of which drifted down over the session.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold is always a focus for the Australian market and I think it put a real dent into sentiment today,&quot; a dealer from a Melbourne-based brokerage said.</p>
<p>The dealer said investors were happy to pause and reflect on their portfolios after the market's strong run last week and ahead of the end of Australia's fiscal year on Monday, June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you will see volumes start to build up towards the end of the week regardless of market direction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BHP shares were the most active on the day, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the day's turnover ahead of its full year results announcement due on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts anticipate BHP will post a slightly higher year net profit of between A$1.35 billion (US$1.01 billion) to A$1.4 billion before abnormal items.</p>
<p>BHP shares closed 35 cents weaker at A$19.50.</p>
<p>Media issues defied the negative trend with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp underpinning the sector's rise.</p>
<p>Dealers said News Corp ordinary and preferred stock continued to rise after the company pleased local and offshore investors earlier this month by announcing a deal to offload its U.S. satellite TV assets.</p>
<p>News Corp ordinary shares finished 13 cents higher at A$6.41 while its preferred shares ended 10.3 cents higher at A$5.28.</p>
<p>Kerry Packer's media group Publishing and Broadcasting shares also closed firmer after it and other key players in Australia's loss-making pay television industry announced plans to rationalise the sector late last week.</p>
<p>PBL stock ended 18 cents higher at A$7.52 and troubled pay television operator Australis Media added one cent to finish at 13.5 cents.</p>
<p>The shares of industrial services group, Hawker Richardson jumped 31 cents to A$1.66 on heavy volume after investment group Austrim launched a A$1.60 per share cash bid for the company.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.75)</p>
