<headline>Iraq to stop firing at U.S. and allied warplanes.</headline>
<dateline>BAGHDAD 1996-09-13</dateline>

<p>Iraq said on Friday it would halt its attacks on U.S. and allied warplanes flying over its north and south as of midnight local time (2000 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;The Revolutionary Command Council has decided today to suspend our military reaction (until further notice) to the parallel lines (no-fly zones)...,&quot; the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said, quoting an official spokesman for the ruling Revolutionary Command Council.</p>
<p>But the Iraqi agency said Baghdad still considered the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq -- patrolled by western aircraft but closed to Iraqi planes -- to be illegitimate according to international law and U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>The spokesman told the agency the decision to halt attacks was taken in response to an initiative by Russia and those &quot;Iraqi friends&quot; in the world who denounced U.S. missiles strikes on Iraq.</p>
<p>Last week the United States fired 44 cruise missiles against air defence targets in southern Iraq after Iraqi troops intervened in the country's north to help a Kurdish group fighting a rival Kurdish faction.</p>
<p>The United States has sent Stealth planes and aircraft carriers to the region in preperation for an expected attack on Iraq for also firing missiles at U.S. air patrols over north and south Iraq, both part of the &quot;no-fly&quot; zones for Iraqi aircraft set up after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>The United States said immediately after the Iraqi announcement that it would be &quot;looking at actions not statements.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The president himself has said it is actions that speak louder than words and we'll be looking at actions not statements from Baghdad,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said</p>
<p>But the Iraqi spokesman vowed that Iraqi armed forces would return fire if Iraq was attacked by the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Americans renew their aggression after this date and they open fire against our troops, our forces would retaliate,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that this &quot;Iraqi stand emanates from its national duty to defend its rights and sovereignty and that the timing of this battle (with the U.S.) was made a must by the situations and it was not of Iraq's choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier an Iraqi military spokesman said U.S. and allied aircraft made 42 sorties over its southern skies but it did not say that its air defence units fired at them.</p>
<p>On Thursday the spokesman said Iraq's anti-aircraft units fired three missiles at intruding American warplanes and forced them to flee Iraqi airspace. Washington said the missiles did not come anywhere near any planes.</p>
