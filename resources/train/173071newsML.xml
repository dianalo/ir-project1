<headline>Bob Dole, just another guy on the street.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-11-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, who said if he lost he would be just another man without a title, proved it on Thursday.</p>
<p>He left his Watergate apartment complex this morning with a bundle of clothes under his arm and took them to the dry cleaners across the street like other residents in the Foggy Bottom area of Washington.</p>
<p>The former senator, who had been surrounded by staff for most of his political life during 35 years in Washington, then bought a couple of coffees at a nearby restaurant and gave one to his wife, Elizabeth. Then the couple walked their miniature schnauzer dog, Leader, around the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Dole was driven off later to have pictures taken with his staff now dismantling his campaign headquarters across town.</p>
