<p>President Bill Clinton added to his reputation for tardiness on Monday, missing by five minutes the noon deadline for taking the oath of office at his swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Constitution, Clinton's first term ended at noon, and since he did not take the oath for his second term until 12:05 p.m. EST (1705 GMT), some speculated that perhaps Vice President Al Gore was acting president for those five minutes, since he took his oath on time.</p>
<p>&quot;I would think that Al Gore was acting president for five minutes,&quot; said presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution think tank. &quot;That will probably be a good trivia question in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>But constitutional scholar Bruce Fein of the conservative Heritage Foundation said the Constitution makes clear that the new president takes over at noon whether the oath has been administered or not.</p>
<p>&quot;That would certainly be in my view one of the less grievous faults of Mr. Clinton,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton's tardiness over the years has been legendary, prompting some wags at the White House to refer to the president as working on Clinton Standard Time.</p>
<p>He got off to a late start on Monday morning, and was 15 minutes late to a national prayer service at Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>That service went long, particularly because the Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke for 25 minutes.</p>
<p>By the time Clinton got back to the White House for the traditional pre-inaugural coffee with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other leaders of Congress, he was about 15 minutes late.</p>
<p>He got to Capitol Hill well in time for the swearing-in ceremony. However, opera star Jessye Norman was singing to the crowd as the noon hour tolled.</p>
