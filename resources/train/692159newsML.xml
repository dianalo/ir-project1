<p>Venezuela's basket of crude oil and refined products rose 30 cents in the week of the OPEC meeting to close at $15.28 per barrel on Friday, the Energy and Mines Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ministers from the 11-member Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) met on Wednesday in Vienna and agreed to keep unchanged a 25 million barrel per day (bpd) production ceiling.</p>
<p>International oil traders said the agreement had little impact on prices because most of the 11-member cartel, including Venezuela, were already producing well above their agreed levels.</p>
<p>They attributed the rise to a temporary disruption in Iraqi oil exports under a UN-sponsored aid programme and tight supply in the key Atlantic basin market.</p>
<p>The basket price has been falling steadily throughout this year from a peak of $21.55 per barrel in December 1996 to an average of $15.78 for June so far.</p>
<p>The basket closed 1996 with one of the highest average prices for several years at $18.39 per barrel, against $14.84 for 1995.</p>
<p>In 1997 so far, the basket stood at $16.83 per barrel, 14 cents down on the week.</p>
<p>Venezuela's government based its 1997 budget on an average price for the year of $14.40 per barrel, and this week's 1998 budget proposal set a $15.50 target price.</p>
