<p>Anonymous Chinese have launched China's first electronic underground magazine and its cyberspace publishers say the publication is aimed at smashing the official stranglehold on freedom of expression.</p>
<p>&quot;'Tunnel' is mainland China's first unrestricted magazine to be distributed by electronic mail and its aim is to break through the present lock on information and controls on expression,&quot; said the magazine's inaugural statement.</p>
<p>Its founders launched Tunnel magazine on June 3, and devoted the first issue to a memorial to the hundreds of civilians killed when troops and tanks of the People's Liberation Army Daily crushed student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 3-4, 1989.</p>
<p>The Chinese-language magazine had sent out five editions by Wednesday.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, the daring magazine was written and compiled in China, then sent out to a site in the United States from where it was distributed by e-mail back into China, said Chinese sources who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The claim could not be independently verified.</p>
<p>The strength of the magazine derived from its virtually untraceable distribution system, the inaugural statement said.</p>
<p>The magazine urged readers to pass on editions to others, assuring its readers that this would not put them at risk from &quot;relevant departments&quot;.</p>
<p>In China, anyone wanting to open an Internet account must register with the police and analysts say security organs have taken a keen interest in monitoring potential dissent in cyberspace.</p>
<p>The electronic magazine was among the most outspoken publications seen inside China for many years and called openly for an end to communist rule.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't see here the inspired and impassioned words of the usual inaugural statement because the basis for Tunnel is technology. Freedom and inspirational ideas have always existed, the difference is they could not be disseminated,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The autocracy in the past was able to block what we see and what we hear and rectify our thoughts because they monopolised the technology for dissemination of information,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The computer network has changed this. It disseminates technology onto the desks of each and everyone of us... hence it can undermine the two pillars of an autocratic society -- monopoly and suppression,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Treading the path of micro-technology, rather than the bubbling emotions of (Tiananmen) Square, could bring us closer to our common desire for freedom and democracy,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Most articles in the magazine were by U.S.-based authors but the introductory issue was written by an author the sources said was based in China who gave his name only as &quot;Temporarily Anonymous&quot;.</p>
<p>The first two editions focused on Tiananmen Square while the third discussed the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the fourth and fifth reprinted the script of the controversial U.S.-made documentary film &quot;Gate of Heavenly Peace&quot; about the 1989 student crackdown.</p>
<p>The magazine was sent from the email address nobody@usa.net and urged readers with comments to write to voice@earthling.net. Authors wishing to publish in Tunnel should submit their works to tunnel@earthling.net.</p>
<p>&quot;When we bore through the barrier so that it is ridden with gaping holes, then the collapse is not far away,&quot; its inaugural statement concluded.</p>
