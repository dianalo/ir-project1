<title>USA: CME hogs end mixed, pork bellies mostly lower.</title>
<headline>CME hogs end mixed, pork bellies mostly lower.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME hog futures firmed late to close mixed with renewed weather concerns and fund rolling supporting nearbys while pork belly futures finished weak despite the light pace of slaughter, traders said.</p>
<p>Hog futures closed 0.350 cent a lb higher to 0.250 lower with February up 0.075 at 77.700 cents. Pork bellies ended 0.575 cent a lb lower to 0.400 higher with only August up and February off most at 78.00 cents.</p>
<p>Although hog runs may swell early next week from hogs backed up by this week's cold snap, hog futures rose on forecasts for more cold and possible snow, traders said.</p>
<p>Cold weather is forecast to hang on through next week with a possible snow storm moving into the Midwest by midweek. Pork prices may also have bottomed, even though part of the support in pork came from reduced kills, sources said.</p>
<p>Deferred months were pressured by USDA's estimate of less-than-expected ending corn stocks, indicating an increase in corn usage. The implication traders drew from the corn data was that hog numbers may be larger than previously estimated.</p>
<p>&quot;The (corn) usage figure was larger than expected, and if you're using more of it, then you have to be feeding it to something,&quot; said Chuck Levitt, analyst for Alaron Trading Corp.  </p>
<p>Rand Financials sold February early but covered short positions later. Cargill Investor Services also bought late while also doing the &quot;Goldman roll&quot;, rolling the funds longs into April. Refco did the &quot;roll&quot; earlier. Smith Barney bought April late and Lind-Waldock sold June, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In hog options, locals sold the February 78 straddle, based on time decay over the weekend. LFG sold June 82 calls. Commission house continued to offer April 72 puts, August 76 calls and October 62 puts, pit sources added.</p>
<p>An overall weaker tone to cash pork belly prices again weighed on pork belly futures late, traders said.</p>
<p>Although the USDA reported cash bellies steady to higher at noon, the market should have been much stronger based on the very light weather reduced hog kills, some traders noted. Late fund liquidation added to pressure and pushed prices down into closing sell stops, they said.</p>
<p>Retail demand for cash bellies remains slow and product is moving into storage despite the light slaughter pace and possible weather-reduced kills again next week, they added.</p>
<p>Cargill was a notable seller again late, pit souces said.</p>
<p>USDA estimated Friday hog slaughter at 247,000 head, well down from 365,000 a week ago and 369,000 a year ago.</p>
<p>The weekly slaughter was tabbed at 1,635,000 head, above the holiday week last week of 1,483,000 but below 1,891,000 a year ago.</p>
