<p>Pope John Paul beatified a gypsy man shot by firing squad during the Spanish Civil War in a colourful ceremony on Sunday that put the first member of the nomadic people on the road to Roman Catholic sainthood.</p>
<p>Thousands of gypsies from around Europe attended a mass in St Peter's Square at which the Pope beatified Ceferino Jimenez Malla, an illiterate gypsy horse trader known as &quot;El Pele&quot;.</p>
<p>The wailing of a gypsy violin and a soulful Spanish guitar mingled with the traditional Latin chanting of a choir in one of the most colourful masses at the Vatican recently. Some 40,000 packed St Peter's Square for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Many of the pilgrims, most of them from Spain, wore bright bandanas around their neck and other traditional clothes.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old Pope himself donned unusually colourful liturgical garb for the occasion, wearing vestments of fiery red, yellow and orange in a design resembling a burning flame.</p>
<p>At the end of the Mass the Polish Pope addressed the gypsy pilgrims in one of their own languages in a phrase that could have been uttered by a fortune teller. &quot;May you have luck, health and live in peace,&quot; he told them in Romanes.</p>
<p>Jimenez was one of five people the Pope declared blessed by the Roman Catholic Church. Beatification is the penultimate step before sainthood and is bestowed on people who showed heroic virtue during their lives.</p>
<p>Jimenez, a strong-willed Spanish Gitane, lived around Barbastro, working mostly as a horse trader. He was born into a poor gypsy family in the region of Aragon.</p>
<p>As he became more successful in trade, he gained the reputation of being an honest man who tried to improve relations between the area's gypsies and the &quot;payos&quot; or non-gypsies.</p>
<p>Deeply religious despite his lack of formal education, Jimenez was arrested in July 1936 by an anti-clerical militia after he publicly defended a priest. When asked if he had any weapons, Jimenez extracted a rosary from his pocket.</p>
<p>Aged 75, he was killed later by firing squad along with a number of priests and other people who had been arrested in the area by forces opposed to General Francisco Franco.</p>
<p>&quot;Jimenez...died for the faith that he lived out,&quot; the Pope said. &quot;His life shows how Christ is present in various people and races and that all people are called to holiness.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pope said today's gypsies should look to Jimenez as a model because he tried to sow harmony among diverse people.</p>
<p>Gypsies, who first came from India more than a thousand years ago, number between seven and 10 million in Europe today. The Nazis killed about a half million gypsies in World War Two.</p>
<p>Jimenez's official biography, handed out in the square, describes him as &quot;eminently honest&quot; and with a reputation for prudence and wisdom that led him to be sought out by gypsies and peasants to settle conflicts.</p>
<p>One of the prayers of the faithful was read in Romanes, the language of some European gypsies, by a gypsy woman wearing a frilly sky blue dress and long gold ear rings.</p>
<p>She called for the defence of the rights of ethnic minorities around the world.</p>
<p>Among the gifts given to the the Pope during the service were a walking stick, a traditional sign of gypsy authority.</p>
<p>The other four people beatified included Maria Encarnacion Rosal, a 19th century Guatemalan nun who became the first person from her country to be put on the road to sainthood.</p>
<p>Florentino Asensio Barroso, a Spanish bishop killed in the civil war, Gaetano Catanoso, an Italian priest who died in 1963 and founded an order of missionaries and Enrico Rebuschini, an Italian priest who dedicated his life to helping the sick, were also beatified.</p>
