<p>Amnesty International urged Bahrain on Monday to halt the trial of 81 people accused of involvement in an alleged Iranian-backed anti-government plot, saying the defendents were not getting a fair deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The trials have been grossly unfair at all stages, and none of the defendants will have the right to appeal before a higher court. This is particularly alarming since if convicted, some of the defendants could face the death penalty,&quot; the human rights group said.</p>
<p>&quot;Irrespective of the charges against them, the accused are entitled to a fair and public trial in line with international standards,&quot; an Amnesty statement said.</p>
<p>It said most trial sessions for the suspects -- 59 in court and the rest tried in absentia -- had been closed to the public and no independent observers were allowed to attend.</p>
<p>Lawyers have said some verdicts could be passed this week by the State Security Court, which began hearing the case on March 1, and some suspects could face the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>The defendants are accused of joining the military wing of the Bahraini Hizbollah (Party of God), creating an organisation aimed at toppling the government, possessing weapons without permission and having contacts with a foreign country.</p>
<p>Political parties are banned in Bahrain. Bahrain in June accused Shi'ite Moslem Iran of backing an attempt to overthrow the government. Iran denied the allegation.</p>
<p>Members of the island's majority Shi'ite Moslem community seeking political and economic reform by the Sunni rulers have waged a campaign of bombings, arson, sabotage and riots since December 1994. At least 28 people have been killed and hundreds arrested.</p>
