<headline>Gold market braces for further falls-analysts.</headline>

<p>The price of gold fell to its lowest level since March 24, 1993 on Wednesday and shows all signs of falling even further, according to bullion market dealers and analysts.</p>
<p>Even the most optimistic lights were barely visible through the gathering gloom.</p>
<p>&quot;The best hope is that there is no hope which means the price will probably not fall in a straight line,&quot; said precious metals markets analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).</p>
<p>He expected the fall to at least slow ahead of the July 4 U.S. Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>At its official morning fixing in London, bullion was set at $331.45 per ounce down from an already teetering $333.70 on Tuesday and taking it perilously close to its next major support level at $330.00</p>
<p>&quot;A break there would be very significant as more psychologically induced selling would be seen if the $330 goes,&quot; an analyst at another major European bullion trading bank said.</p>
<p>The last time gold was in this area -- March 1993 when its low was $326.10 --it was its lowest price for seven years.</p>
<p>The auguries suggest that price will be under examination pretty soon. &quot;There is everything to go for on the downside,' said market analyst Ted Arnold at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>&quot;The (investment) funds realise there has to be a new fundamentally based equilibrium in gold,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>According to Arnold, that would mean up to 300 tonnes of gold mining capacity being shut down due to low profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;But the miners will not roll over and die easily. We are in for a long, bitter time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The mining companies are already doing what they can to safeguard their profitability and that is not helping the price, according to market analysts.</p>
<p>They note that the gold lease rate -- the cost to the bullion banks of borrowing gold -- has almost doubled in the past two weeks indicating the level of borrowing has increased.</p>
<p>That can happen for several reasons but one of the most likely is when producers borrow gold, which they have not yet mined, to sell in order to avoid lower prices in the future.</p>
<p>The higher cost producers in Australia have been active sellers this week and that has damped an already soggy price, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Australians are concerned about a further interest rate cut at home and are trying to take advantage of the domestic currency moving in their favour,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>Another reason for high lease rates is borrowing by speculators selling &quot;short&quot; -- selling gold they do not own in the belief that the price will fall far enough for them to cover their liabilities in the future.</p>
<p>It was the investment funds' positioning to take advantage of prices falling further that had broken the gold price out of its previous price range between $335-$340, market analysts said.</p>
<p>Some dealers said a European central bank -- Belgium was the favourite - had been selling gold from its reserves which also explained the staggering price but others were less sure.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more likely to be a bullion bank selling possibly as a result of additional lending (to the market) by a central bank,&quot; a market analyst said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile physical demand has slumped despite the apparent attractiveness of cheap prices which could be connected to the markets in Hong Kong being closed so far this week for the territory's hand over to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting to see if there is a reaction on the re-entry of Hong Kong,&quot; a dealer said. Hong Kong is one of the key gold entrepot points for China.</p>
<p>UBS's Smith said it was crucial that the gold price held above its 1993 lows. He noted that since 1982 each time the gold price collapsed it was rescued by a factor outside the market.</p>
<p>In 1982 there was the Mexican debt crisis, in 1984 the collapse of Continental Illinois Bank, in 1995 the dollar slumped after the G7 &quot;Plaza&quot; accord and in 1993 the well publicised entry of finaciers George Soros and James Goldsmith to the market sparked a rally to over $400 in five months.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time it has needed a catalyst to get it back up. It is difficult to see where that will come from this time,&quot; he said.</p>
