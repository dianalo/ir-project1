<p>A strike by train conductors cut rail services to about a third of normal in many parts of France on Thursday, state-run SNCF railways said.</p>
<p>Other protests as the country embarked on a campaign for a snap parliamentary election on May 25-June 1 involved fishermen, airline pilots, coalminers and farmers.</p>
<p>SNCF said Eurostar trains linking Paris and London via the Channel tunnel and most suburban services around Paris were the only ones unaffected by the strike by 10,000 conductors.</p>
<p>Disruption started at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and was expected to continue until 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) on Friday. Trains cannot run without the conductors who are responsible for safety aboard trains as well as checking tickets.</p>
<p>Express and regional services in other parts of the country were cut to about a third of normal. Two out of three high speed trains between Paris and Brussels were running normally.</p>
<p>Six trade unions called the strike over wages and working conditions, a new sign of labour unrest and opposition to the government's austerity measures to comply with budget criteria to join the single European currency.</p>
<p>Budget austerity is a major issue in the election campaign.</p>
<p>Fishermen lifted a three-day-old blockade of the Channel ports of Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne as they opened talks with Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Philippe Vasseur.</p>
<p>They warned they may resume the blockade later in the day depending on the outcome of the talks in Paris on their protest against European Union regulations calling for bigger holes in the mesh of their nets.</p>
<p>The fishermen say wider holes may let 50 percent of their catch through.</p>
<p>The blockade had left hundreds of trucks blocking the motorway on the British side of the Channel leading to the port of Dover. Ferries have been diverted to the Belgian ports of Zeebrugge and Ostend.</p>
<p>French courts on Wednesday granted European ferry giants P&amp;O, Stena Line AB, and Sea France an injunction to lift the blockade which begun on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Air Liberte and TAT, French units of British Airways, cancelled about half of their flights in a two-week-old strike by pilots and cabin crew protesting that a merger of the two airlines will affect their pay and working conditions.</p>
<p>The airlines will cut flights by 40 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>More strikes loomed, and Air France Europe said it would cut flights by about half at the weekend due to a pilots' strike over reforms under a merger with parent company Air France.</p>
<p>Truckers have called a strike from May 5, threatening to repeat a blockade that plunged the country into chaos last November to demand retirement at 55 instead of 60. Unions want early retirement extended to bus drivers.</p>
<p>French media said the International Truckers' Union had handed France a 800-million franc bill for compensation of damage to cargoes during last year's strike.</p>
<p>Coalminers in the eastern region of Lorraine, stopped work for 24 hours and marched through the town of Forbach to demand wage hikes. Unions said the strike affected up to 90 percent of pit workers and half of surface workers at the state-run Houilleres de Lorraine.</p>
<p>Farmers angered by falling prices for their products ransacked a food market in the Loire valley town of Angers, destroying cherries, carrots and other goods imported from Spain and Morocco.</p>
