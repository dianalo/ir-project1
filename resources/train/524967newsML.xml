<title>USA: CME pork bellies end sharply up after new highs.</title>
<headline>CME pork bellies end sharply up after new highs.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>CME pork belly futures rebounded from a lower start and rallied to new contract highs in all frozen contracts on strong cash ideas and technical demand before finishing sharply higher, traders said. Hog futures also rallied to end mostly higher closes, traders said.</p>
<p>Pork bellies closed 1.675 to 1.000 cents higher with May up 1.450 at 91.400 cents after setting a new contract high of 91.800 cents. Hog futures ended 0.425 cent higher to 0.250 lower with June off 0.075 at 85.250 cents. July and August contracts ran up to new contract highs with July's new high of 85.750 and August's new high of 82.750 cents.</p>
<p>Initial losses stemmed from bearish indications on Friday's U.S. Cold Storage report wich showed belly stocks at 54.8 million lbs, above the high end of expectations of 53.2 million lbs.</p>
<p>But demand was evident from increased export demand for bellies, light storings during April and expected lighter hog slaughter rates, floor sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japanese situation, having them come in and buy (U.S. bellies), is the major reason for this rally&quot; that started last week, said Dan Vaught, livestock analyst for AG Edwards.  </p>
<p>Japan said last week that it would be buying U.S. pork bellies until late May to supplement needs through the end of the year because of a ban on Taiwan pork exports.</p>
<p>Firmer cash belly prices quoted by the USDA at noon and ideas of reduced hog kills the next couple of weeks added to strong cash ideas. Farmers are expected to spend more time with spring planting and less time shipping hogs to market in the near term and some packers in turn, have cut kills to strengthen margins, traders said.</p>
<p>Fund buying and mixed short covering took belly futures to their new highs with light profit taking cited on the scale up, they said.</p>
<p>Vaught said belly futures were starting to look overbought, especially as high cash belly prices will cut off domestic demand. But futures could still go higher before running into any heavy selling interst.</p>
<p>&quot;We showed last year that once (cash) gets some business it can really run - I'm not making any ventures how high it's going to go,&quot; Vaught said.</p>
<p>Refco, LFG, Dean Witter, Prudential Securities and ABN Chicogo Corp were notable buyers, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Expectations of reduced hog runs also bolstered hog futures with spillover demand from pork bellies cited. Buy stops sent July and August up to new contract highs, traders said.</p>
<p>Cash hog ideas for Tuesday turned steady to possibly higher from early indications of lower prices. Underlying support also was expected in the hog pit from expectations of increased pork exports, they said.</p>
<p>Cargill Investor Services bought June while Refco sold and Rand Financials bought July and August. Rosenthal Collins and Prudential Securities also bought August early while Cargill Investor Services sold, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In hog options, Refco bought December 72 puts early. Commission houses rolled June 81 straddles into 84 straddles on the recovered, pit sources added.</p>
