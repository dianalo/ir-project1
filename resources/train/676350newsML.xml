<headline>FOCUS - French EMU pledge mutes reaction to Jospin.</headline>

<p>French markets, torn between confidence Europe's single currency will start on time and worry about expensive political promises, showed little reaction on Friday to the new Socialist prime minister's policy speech the previous day.</p>
<p>Economists said Lionel Jospin's pledge to take France into economic and monetary union (EMU) on time offset concern about vague spending promises. Jospin's cautious tone, indicating the government was aware of economic constraints, also helped comfort investors.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index of leading shares on the Paris bourse closed up 17.41 points or 0.64 percent at 2,757.10 near Friday's midsession after closing slightly lower on Thursday.</p>
<p>Though volatile during and right after the election campaign, the index is trading 234 points, or more than nine-percent, higher than its close of 2,522.67 on April 21, when President Jacques Chirac dissolved parliament.</p>
<p>The 10-year bond yield has shed 17 basis points since April 21 while the spread between French and German bond yields, a key measure of relative market risk, was minus nine late on Friday compared to minus four on April 21.</p>
<p>The French franc, at 3.3750 per mark, was only down a centime from 3.3637 on April 21.</p>
<p>Some analysts said Jospin was notably short on specifics and had changed little for financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;People see the domestic risks more clearly than before the election and are concerned about the Socialists...but they still have EMU as a stabilising force in their views,&quot; Sean Shepley at CS First Boston said.</p>
<p>With French commitment to EMU accepted, people were banking on the idea the Socialists would not be able to enact programmes that were too damaging to the deficit and debt levels, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not a lot of interest or a lot of volume,&quot; a share broker said. &quot;Although we were expecting some clarifications, a lot of doubt remains. A lot of decisions have been put off to September, so uncertainty persists.&quot;</p>
<p>Though some of the markets' gains were due to high liquidity in French markets, much of it stems from what some analysts call the &quot;complacent&quot; view that no matter what France does, EMU will start next year.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the idea that no matter what the French do, EMU will go on, it is irreversible,&quot; said Eric Chaney, economist at Morgan Stanley. &quot;Markets are also expecting the euro to start at a weak level, which is good for stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>But Chaney said the market should be pricing in more risk because Jospin's promises to raise the minimum wage, boost school allowances and renovate public housing would cost about nine to ten billion francs, even when offset by a cut in family allowances.</p>
<p>&quot;I am waiting for Mr Jospin to announce how he will pay for this,&quot; Chaney said.</p>
