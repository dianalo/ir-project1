<p>CSCE world sugar was called to open mostly flat on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The expiry of the July contract is expected to remain orderly, with activity seen focused on the July/October spread in the near term. The spread narrowed to 0.04 cent on Thursday, from 0.05 cent.</p>
<p>The contract expires on June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing a very slow liquidation that looks orderly,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The specs seem comfortable and there is no pressure on them.&quot;</p>
<p>Thursday, the July contract closed up 0.01 at 11.37 cents per lb, traded 11.38 to 11.30 cents on Thursday. Most-active October settled 0.02 cent firmer at 11.33 cents, while the rest of the board closed 0.01 and 0.02 cent higher.</p>
<p>LIFFE spot August white sugar futures were thinly traded on Friday, with the spot August contract unchanged at $323.30, at 0850 EDT/1250 GMT.</p>
<p>The rest of the board was trading $0.10 to $0.40 weaker.</p>
