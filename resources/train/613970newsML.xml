<p>Ministers from the 29 OECD countries pledged on Monday to introduce laws to criminalise bribery of state officials in a battle against corruption in international business.</p>
<p>They struck a compromise between the United States on one side and France and Germany on the other, agreeing to enact laws by April 1998 to make bribery of state officials a punishable offence and to start parallel talks on an anti-bribery treaty.</p>
<p>The deal bridged the gap between U.S. pressure for rapid action and demands from France and Germany for a treaty which would ensure more uniform legislation against corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments will have the obligation to conform their domestic laws to the binding convention,&quot; U.S. ambassador David Aaron told reporters at a two-day OECD meeting here.</p>
<p>U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley said the United States welcomed the decision to take decisive action, adding that the goal was for complete compliance. However, he agreed that bribery was unlikely to vanish overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a need for national legislation,&quot; he said. &quot;Both passing adequate legislation and enforcing it are key.&quot;</p>
<p>Daley said the United States urged all governments to eliminate the &quot;tax deductibility of foreign bribes&quot; immediately in line with an OECD commitment reached last year.</p>
<p>Concern had been expressed, mainly by France and Germany, that there was a danger in each country legislating separately since standard definitions of bribery may vary within the OECD.</p>
<p>Aaron said he was confident that the problem could be overcome, and added that there was already agreement on two &quot;excuses&quot; for accepting or receiving bribes which would not be accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither 'It wasn't a lot of money' or 'Everybody does it in this country -- it's part of the culture' will be an acceptable excuse,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the definition of a bribe was also simple -- &quot;a consideration given for the maintenance or securing of business&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Under that definition, many business gifts are bribes,&quot; he said.</p>
