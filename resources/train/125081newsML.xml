<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - London stocks ended lower in the wake of disappointing UK economic data and as profit-taking resumed for a second day in the U.S. The FTSE 100 index ended just short of the day's worst level to be down 26.4 points at 4,024.4 in volume of 615 million shares.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT- Shares closed bourse dealings lower as players took profit following record highs reached during Tuesday. Although the dollar came back from levels reached in early European trade, it held above the critical 1.54 mark level, supporting German exporting sectors, particularly chemicals and autos. The DAX index ended down 13.55 points to 2,714.90. In post bourse trade the Dax stood at 2705.06 down 13.67 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares fell in the afternoon on opening losses on Wall Street, consolidating after reaching a year high on Tuesday. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 9.76 points or 0.45 percent at 2,158.52 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,157 from 2,172 on Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended a listless day weaker in low volumes, slipping below the psychologically important 3,800 level as early Wall Street lows put the market under pressure. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended down 32.0 points, or 0.84 percent, at 3,790.2 points. The Broad SPI fell 0.65 percent, or 15.90 points, to 2,430.35.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended slightly lower after profit taking eroded early additions to the previous day's gains. Dealers said the losses were cushioned by small-lot buying by investors and some pubic funds. The benchmark Nikkei 225 finished 32.74 points, or 0.15 percent lower at 21,397.19.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks ended the session sharply lower, after a morning surge to a new intra-day record high prompted investors to take profits during the afternoon. The Hang Seng index closed 94.52 points lower at 12,396.18, well off the intra-day record of 12,602.34 hit earlier.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares ended slightly below their record closing high with a mid-morning rally in resources issues helping the market to recover from early profit-taking concentrated on key industrial issues. The All Ordinaries index finished 1.2 points lower at 2,365, but well off its intra-day low of 2,351.6.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African industrial shares ended weaker on futures-related activity and gold shares slumped amid poor gold quartely results and a lacklustre bullion price. Dealers said the market had expected a Wall Street to firm on Tuesday night and futures players were caught long on Wednesday following falls on the U.S. market. The overall index ended down 50.2 points to 7,022.9, the industrial index lost 45.8 points to 8,260.2 points and the gold index shed 28.4 points to 1,695.1 points.</p>
