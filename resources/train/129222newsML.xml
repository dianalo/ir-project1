<title>ISRAEL: Israeli bonds close higher.</title>
<headline>Israeli bonds close higher.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-10-20</dateline>

<p>Israeli bonds continued higher on Sunday in moderate trading, with dollar-linked bonds leading the way, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.03 pct to 167.75</p>
<p>* CPI (consumer price index) linked government bonds: +0.15 pct to 168.29</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: +1.52 pct at 167.80</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds (Gilon - issued for four years): +0.11 pct to 167.12</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.06 pct at 158.37 &quot;The trend was positive up and down the line,&quot; said Eli Nahum, head of research for Zannex Securities.</p>
<p>Dollar-linked bonds were especially strong on the back of a rise by the U.S. currency against the Israeli shekel. The U.S. currency rose more than two percent in the local foreign currency market on Thursday and Friday to 3.2690 against 3.2030 on Wednesday. There is no forex trading in Israel on Sunday.</p>
<p>Elisha Rosenfeld, a portfolio manager at Lehava Investments. said that of the 17 bond series of Gilboa dollar-linked bonds, prices on all but one rose in excess of one percent. Turnover, however, was a relatively low nine million shekels.</p>
<p>Medium- and long-term inflation-indexed bonds were higher, while short bonds up to two years were mixed, said Rosenfeld.</p>
<p>Nahum attributed the rise in bond prices since last Tuesday to four factors: the low September consumer price index released last week, expectations of a cut in interest rates next week from the current 15.5 percent, reports that the government is preparing a wide-ranging economic programme and negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians towards an Israeli withdrawl from Hebron.</p>
<p>Although the market has focused on the interest rate outlook in recent days, Nahum said the Bank of Israel's decision on November rates would have less of an impact on bond prices than other factors. The central bank is scheduled to announce new short-term rates October 28.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether or not (Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel) lowers interest rates in the short run, expectations of an economic programme and the Palestinian talks are what will lead the market,&quot; Nahum said.</p>
<p>The economic package is expected to include further budget cuts in 1997, capital market reforms and a new long-term monetary policy to be unveiled after parliament approves the 1997 budget by the end of December.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israeli-Palestinian negotiators held informal talks on Sunday about the long-delayed Israeli withdrawal from Hebron.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
