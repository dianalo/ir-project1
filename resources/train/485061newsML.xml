<title>CANADA: DBRS rates Rogers Comms at B (high).</title>
<headline>DBRS rates Rogers Comms at B (high).</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-04-03</dateline>

<p>Dominion Bond Rating Service said on Thursday that it set a B (high) rating for all senior notes, debentures, convertible senior debentures and liquid yield option notes of Rogers Communications Inc.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based ratings agency said it rated senior secured notes and debentures of Rogers Cablesystems Ltd at BB (low) and senior subordinated debentures at B (high).</p>
<p>Dominion rated Rogers Cantel Mobile Communications Inc senior secured notes and debentures at BB and rated its senior subordinated notes at BB (low).</p>
<p>All ratings were given a stable trend outlook.  </p>
<p>DBRS said its ratings for Rogers Communications reflected the holding company structure with high corporate debt levels as well as ratings assigned to Rogers Cantel and Rogers Cablesystems.</p>
<p>&quot;As there is a large amount of debt at the holding company level and, consequently, a relatively large amount of interest expense, it could face challenges in meeting its cash outflow needs when it has limited interest or dividend inflow from its main subsidiaries, which are themselves heavily leveraged with negative earnings,&quot; DBRS said.</p>
<p>DBRS said its rating for Rogers Cablesystems Ltd reflected the company's strong franchises including Toronto and Vancouver. It said those two areas provided high penetration rates and good potential for new products and services. But it said Cablesystems faced prospects of less regulation, rapid changes in competing technologies and an extremely weak balance sheet. Margins were expected to remain under pressure from the need to support the financing of large capital expenditures and competition from wireless cable, direct-to-home satellite-TV and telephone companies.</p>
<p>Dominion said its rating on Rogers Cantel reflected a strong national network with good market share and a rapidly growing subscriber base.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the balance sheet is extremely weak with the ongoing equity erosion due to negative earnings. Future capital expenditure needs are enormous as the company expands and develops its cellular network.&quot;</p>
