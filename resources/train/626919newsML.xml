<p>Wall Street could suffer next week if a spate of economic statistics highlighted by May payrolls reinforce Intel Corp.'s Friday warning that the second quarter is not going as well as the first.</p>
<p>&quot;The comments made by Intel and also Nike told us that business is not as good in the second quarter as it has been,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears as though no one wishes to reach the conclusion that business is poor. But they will find out what's going on in the second quarter when we look at May NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Managers), May vehicle sales and the unemployment figures.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Intel, a market leader during rallies, unleashed a flood of selling with its warning early Friday that its second quarter results would fail to meet expectations. Nike stock plummeted Thursday after the company said it saw the three months ending May 31 well below analysts' consensus.</p>
<p>&quot;When Intel says business is bad, it means the demand for chips is not as strong, and there are very few businesses that don't use Intel chips,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>Should statistics show slow and steady economic growth, the market will likely continue its bull run, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks fairly well priced to a favourable economic scenario,&quot; said Pierre Ellis, senior economist with Primark Decision Economics.</p>
<p>Ellis said the market will take its first cues for the month from auto sales figures due out Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and from Monday's May NAPM release.</p>
<p>Indications of a strong economy also pose a threat, as participants worry about Federal Reserve tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong (auto) sales in March may have been the icing on the cake on Fed tightening,&quot; said Ellis. &quot;The consumer sector is an area of great risk.&quot; Ellis added that the talk is for &quot;very moderate&quot; car manufacturing.</p>
<p>On NAPM, Ellis said he was looking for a figure in the moderate range, &quot;pretty much unchanged,&quot; he said. &quot;It was 54.2 in April; anything that is around there will be pretty much neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the week's main event will be Friday's payroll number. &quot;Thats the big one. The payroll employment gives the first real solid set of numbers for May,&quot; Ellis said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (unemployment) rate fell very sharply in April; that's a red flag. The Fed is concerned about something growing too fast.&quot; Ellis said a positive number would be &quot;steady to up a 10th to 5.0 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>First Albany's Johnson said he expected that all the statistics would show the economy to be slowing. &quot;I believe non-farm payrolls will expand by 140,000, not the consensus, which is 220,000,&quot;</p>
<p>Ricky Harrington of Interstate Johnson Lane said that, with the bull market not over yet, many will see the Intel news as a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say the market would be a little unsettled early next week,&quot; said Harrington. &quot;The market is such that any news such as Intel is taken as a buying opportunity. We may still see weakness Monday, but as we go into June we could easily see a strong market.&quot;</p>
<p>Harrington said participants would look to the fact that money is still coming in from overseas and mutual funds.</p>
<p>In stock trading this week, the Dow Jones industrial average closed Friday at 7,331, up from 7,345 a week earlier.</p>
