<p>White sugar futures got off to a slow start on Monday with only the further forward contracts seeing any movement in ranges, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>By 1115 GMT volume amounted to a sparse 205 lots, mainly in December and March, with activity expected to remain subdued until the open of New York where the spot July contract is set to expire at close of business.</p>
<p>August was $1.00 lower at $320.30 and October down $1.10 at $314.50. Other contracts also lost ground.</p>
<p>Market sources said August/October was well supported at around $5.00, citing talk of untenderable sugars hedged against nearby August.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said August looked set to head lower, despite last week's recovery from a concerted fund-led sell-off when the position sank to $315.20.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a short-term downtrend and as such there is a risk that the market will head lower,&quot; said Adrian Haylor, a technical analyst at Sucden, adding that the downtrend would only be broken by a close above $325.00.</p>
<p>Just four lots of August were traded in Paris, with the contract down 30 cents at $320.30.</p>
<p>But in the new 100 ICUMSA market volume totalled 40 lots. August was down 50 cents at $291.00 and October up by the same amount at $293.00.</p>
