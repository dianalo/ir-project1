<p>The head of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has praised the lending policy of the Communications Bank as an example to the state-owned banking sector, the Xinhua news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based Communications Bank had been successful in cutting risks by attaching greater importance to loan quality instead of blindly handing out credit and setting up new branches, the agency quoted People's Bank chief Dai Xianglong as saying.</p>
<p>The bank, which had much smaller assets than the four largest state-owned banks, had made nearly 5.4 billion yuan ($650 million) in profits, ranking third among all China's banks, it quoted Dai as saying but gave no timescale.</p>
<p>By the end of last year, the Communications Bank had 227.7 billion yuan in deposits, up 24.8 percent compared with the year before, and 148.7 billion yuan in outstanding loans, up 22.7 percent, the agency said but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>China is keen to turn its state policy banks into financial institutions run on commercial lines, but reformers have found it difficult to undo the influence of decades spent in a strict command economy where loans were granted on political grounds.</p>
