<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on Friday his country attracted $10 billion in investment during the Middle East economic conference which closed in Cairo on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mubarak gave the figure to newspaper editors who flew to Abu Dhabi with him on Friday, state television said.</p>
<p>&quot;He said that the contracts and agreements signed during the conference for investment in Egypt came to $10 billion,&quot; the television quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, gave the same figure on Thursday for the value of all deals signed during the conference.</p>
<p>The amount is about 16 times the total direct foreign investment in Egypt during the financial year 1995/6 which ended last June.</p>
<p>The largest single deal publicised was a project to export Egyptian liquefied natural gas to Turkey, signed by Egypt, Turkey and the U.S. oil company Amoco. The project is expected to cost between $2 billion and $4 billion.</p>
