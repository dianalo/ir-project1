<p>An elderly New Mexico couple who went cross country skiing to celebrate the wife's birthday were found dead in the mountains above Santa Fe after trekking back into the woods to search for their dog, police said on Friday.</p>
<p>Paul Steel, 71, and his wife Beverly, 69, were found on Thursday huddled together in deep snow on a trail just west of the Santa Fe ski area, 16 miles northwest of the city, police spokesman Rick Goodman said.</p>
<p>&quot;They were snuggled together, she was holding his hand, peacefully,&quot; Goodman said.</p>
<p>After a day of skiing, the couple told a parking attendant they were heading back into the woods to search for their dog.</p>
<p>The woman's ski binding broke a quarter of a mile (400 metres) from their parked car. Exhausted and stuck in deep snow, the couple apparently froze to death, Goodman said.</p>
<p>Their dog was found waiting by their car, he said.</p>
