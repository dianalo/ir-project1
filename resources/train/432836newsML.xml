<p>The bearish trend on the Budapest Stock Exchange continued on Monday, with most shares falling in brisk trade in what dealers said was a large downward correction following earlier sharp price rises.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been going through a serious correction,&quot; said New York Broker's Kalman Schuszter. &quot;We cannot go much further down but I would not say we are at the bottom yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The BUX index was fixed at 5,140.26 points, down 169.89.</p>
<p>Almost all heavyweight shares fell. Pharmaceutical Richter dropped 270 forints and closed at 11,250.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are thinking what price Richter will have at the share offering,&quot; said ABN-Amro Hoare Govett's Andrea Keresztesi.</p>
<p>Share sales in Richter and oil and gas company MOL are expected to resume before the summer.</p>
<p>While Richter fell, MOL was buoyed by strong and continuous foreign interest at only slightly lower levels than on Monday, and closed steady at 3,065 forints, traders said.</p>
<p>OTP Bank slumped to 3,120 before firming back to 3,400 forints at the close, 150 forints below Monday's end.</p>
<p>Schuszter said OTP's recent falls might be partly the consequence of a run by depositors on Postabank, the country's second largest bank, two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;OTP has not managed to revive since the Postabank panic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Spot share turnover soared to 3.67 billion forints from Monday's 1.45 billion, indicating that buyers were already attracted by BSE prices which had been falling since the middle of last week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of trading, foreign brokerages already wanted to buy in large volume,&quot; Schuszter said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the beginning there were no buyers at all, but in the end prices appeared to have become attractive,&quot; said ABN-Amro Hoare Govett's Andrea Keresztesi. &quot;That's positive.&quot;</p>
