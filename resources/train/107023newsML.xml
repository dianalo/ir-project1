<p>Shares in debt-laden Eurotunnel slid again on Wednesday on both sides of the English Channel as doubts about the subsea railway operator's new debt relief deal prompted heavy selling, analysts said.</p>
<p>The shares resumed trading on Monday after being suspended for a week while the company finished negotiated the refinancing 8.7 billion pounds ($13.59 billion) of debt. The shares have slipped 24p to 89-1/2p so far this week -- over 20 percent down since the deal was unveiled two days ago.</p>
<p>Brokers UBS, a long-time bear of the stock, reiterated its sell stance warning Eurotunnel would continue to be substantially cash negative well into the next decade.</p>
<p>&quot;The swap of debt to equity doesn't really look big enough to be a proper long term refinancing,&quot; said UBS analyst Richard Hannah.</p>
<p>&quot;The equity value is pretty minimal on our model and the value of the equity seems to be of &quot;voting&quot; value rather than economic. We think the shares are seriously overvalued at the moment and that's before the dilution comes through,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>UBS calculates that the total net present value of the cash stream from Eurotunnel's remaining 52-year tunnel operating concession at below six billion pounds, well short of its total remaining debt.</p>
