<p>China's stock markets rose calmly on Tuesday reflecting signs of political stability seen since paramount leader Deng Xiaoping died last week, analysts said.</p>
<p>Stocks rose in Hong Kong and fell in Taiwan, but for reasons that had little or nothing to do with politics in giant neighbour China, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Signs are clear during (China's) six-day official mourning period (from last Thursday to Tuesday) that political conditions are stable,&quot; said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage in Shanghai.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets expect no sensational political news to shake them, at least for a few weeks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday offered unstinted praise for Deng during a funeral oration, saying the future lay with economic reforms pioneered by the strongman who died last Wednesday, aged 92.</p>
<p>Modern China's stock markets, established in 1990 under Deng's direction, only officially emerged from an &quot;experimental&quot; phase last year, with many investors still worried that Beijing could decide to close them down, brokers say.</p>
<p>&quot;With Deng's death, investors are nervous about the continuity of policy,&quot; said the stock analyst. &quot;Normal trading today serves to stabilise sentiment.&quot;</p>
<p>Shanghai's domestic A share index closed up 8.752 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,063.83 while the foreign currency B share index ended up 0.589 points, or 0.9 percent, at 66.296.</p>
<p>In sothern Shenzhen, the A share index rose 6.02 points, or 1.66 percent, to 368.7 points while the B index edged up 0.14 points, or 0.09 percent, to 150.87.</p>
<p>&quot;A sense of stability dominated the markets today partly due to the normal trading (hours),&quot; said a senior B share dealer. &quot;This helped the indices move up.&quot;</p>
<p>Trading on China's two stock markets continued through the funeral ceremony for Deng in the morning, although volumes dropped significantly as traders and investors alike watched the live television broadcast.</p>
<p>&quot;The central government wanted to tell millions of investors on the stock markets that they were determined to let the markets continue as before even though their creator is gone,&quot; said a stock analyst. &quot;All markets closed up today, which shows they succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said share prices were likely to rise steadily for at least the next few weeks on strong national economic prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;Technical factors will prevail in the coming weeks,&quot; said a broker. &quot;Investors will buy blue-chip firms expected to post strong 1996 results. They have confidence in the national economy this year after its good performance last year.&quot;</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, share prices rallied on Tuesday, with the Hang Seng Index closing up 144.57 points, or 1.08 percent, at 13,520.26 mainly due to gains in HSBC Holdings.</p>
<p>Brokers said China-related shares continued to attract keen interest and investors had been encouraged by Jiang's vows to push ahead with market-oriented reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning Beijing reiterated the open-door policy will still be maintained,&quot; said Edwin Cheung, dealing director at Taiwan Securities.</p>
<p>In Taipei, analysts said Deng's funeral had no impact on stock trading, with the weighted index falling 21.25 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,887.36.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody talked about it,&quot; said Allen Huang, fund manager for National Securities.</p>
