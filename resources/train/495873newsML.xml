<p>Shell Oil Co's record-setting Mensa natural gas project is on track, with the first of three Gulf of Mexico wells expected to completed in the next two weeks and in production in June, company officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Two companion wells in the $280 million project are set to be producing in September 1997 and March 1998 from the subsea completion, which was designed to flow at 300 million cubic feet per day from wells, the executives said.</p>
<p>Lying under 5,300 feet of water, Mensa will shatter the previous deepwater record of 3,400 feet established by Petrobras off the coast of Brazil and the record 2,940 feet Gulf of Mexico well set by Shell's Mars tension leg platform.</p>
<p>Workers in a Houston fabrication yard are running final tests on a four-story tall, 80-ton subsea tree, the final major piece of equipment in the subsea system designed for Mensa that is expected to become a blueprint for producing oil and gas from Shell's ultra-deep leaseholdings.</p>
<p>&quot;The pieces certainly will be building blocks for future systems,&quot; Mensa project manager Dennis McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>The system also includes a subsea manifold, flowline sled and electrical sled that will feed the natural gas from the deepwater wells into a 68-mile long flowline back to a production platform closer to shore.</p>
<p>The Mensa field, centered in Mississippi Canyon block 687 about 140 miles southeast of New Orleans, was discovered in 1987. Ultimate recovery from the field is expected to be about 720 billion cubic feet of dry natural gas.</p>
<p>The sixth largest U.S. oil company, Shell has led the charge into deeper waters of the Gulf of Mexico and holds about 20 percent of the leased acreage in water deeper than 1,500 feet.</p>
<p>The field is being developed by Shell Deepwater Development Inc, a newly formed unit in the company's New Orleans-based exploration and production group. Shell Oil is a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell group.</p>
