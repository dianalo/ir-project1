<p>Credit Lyonnais Belgium (CLB), a unit of French Credit Lyonnais , said on Monday the discovery of a major fraud against the bank earlier this year would have no impact on future earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank had an excellent commercial and financial health in 1996. This trend continued in the first months of 1997 despite the fact the bank was the victim of a large-scale fraud,&quot; CLB said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The commercial and financial consequences of that unhappy event are under control so that they will have no impact on future earnings,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The bank said in March a former employee had stolen 3.5 billion Belgian francs in one of the biggest fraud cases in Belgian financial history.</p>
<p>The employee and her husband have since been arrested and three people -- including the head of CLB's internal audit -- have left the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;I am 110 percent sure that every loss relating to the fraud will be fully covered by insurance and through the recovery of the assets that were stolen,&quot; CLB chief executive officer Philippe Cloes told a news conference on the bank's 1996 earnings.</p>
<p>The bank's 1996 net profit jumped to 821 million Belgian francs from 628 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Net profit was 383 million francs in the first quarter of 1997, and Cloes said the bank would earn more than one billion francs net if this year's trend continued.</p>
<p>He said all costs relating to the fraud had been fully provisioned for in 1996, using its fund for internal risks.</p>
<p>He declined to reveal the size of the provisions, but when asked whether they amounted to a few hundred million francs he said &quot;certainly not more than that&quot;.</p>
<p>Total 1996 writedowns and provisions stood at 573 million francs, from 651 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Cloes reiterated that his bank is not for sale.</p>
<p>&quot;Credit Lyonnais France has no intention whatsoever of selling CLB...for three reasons: it would not sell a profitable unit; Belgium borders on France and CL France wants to cover its borders; thirdly, we play a key role with a number of specialties in the group, notably in retail (banking), in which we are considered innovative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Belgian banking world has seen an exodus of French groups in recent years, the most recent being Paribas Bank Belgium, a unit of French financial group Paribas , sold to Belgian bank Bacob in a deal announced on Friday.</p>
<p>Late last year Belgian Cera Bank agreed to buy Indosuez Bank Belgium from its French parent Banque Indosuez.</p>
<p>In 1994 Banque Nationale de Paris sold Belgian Banque Nagelmackers to a Belgian insurance company.</p>
<p>&quot;The probability of us being sold is very small,&quot; Cloes said.</p>
