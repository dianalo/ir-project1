<p>A run-a-ball century from Lance Klusener followed by an Indian collapse left South Africa in an unassailable position on the second day of the second test on Friday.</p>
<p>Klusener, batting at number nine, launched a ferocious assault on a tiring attack as he and the more sedate centurion Brian McMillan broke a 95-year-old mark to set an eighth wicket record partnership of 147 in South Africa's 529 for seven declared.</p>
<p>Facing a tricky 16 overs to the close, India's reply began disastrously when Woorkeri Raman was run out for five by Klusener, who then completed a personally unforgettable day by bowling Rahul Dravid in his first over.</p>
<p>With Paul Adams following up with the wicket of nightwatchman Venkatesh Prasad for a duck, India were 29 for three at the close -- still needing a further 301 to avoid the follow-on.</p>
<p>South Africa had already been put in a strong position by Klusener and McMillan, whose 147 in 140 minutes eclipsed the country's previous record of 124 set in 1902-03 by A.W.Nourse and E.A.Halliwell against Australia in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>McMillan's share of the eighth-wicket partnership was a mere 39 as Klusener -- who took eight for 64 on his debut against India in Calcutta in November -- went on the rampage.</p>
<p>Playing in his fourth test match, the Natal all-rounder took just 36 balls over his second 50 and his undefeated 102 included 13 fours and two sixes from 100 balls.</p>
<p>He twice hit Javagal Srinath for three successive boundaries and displayed a nerveless temperament as he crashed Doda Ganesh for a further three successive fours to go to three figures.</p>
<p>McMillan, by contrast, edged to his century. He eventually recorded his third test hundred after facing 227 balls in a five hour, 23 minute stay, hitting nine fours.</p>
<p>The total was South Africa's highest since readmission and their best against India. It was also only the second time three South Africans had scored centuries in the same test innings following Gary Kirsten's 103 of Thursday.</p>
<p>A day of records also included a record seventh wicket stand against India of 83 between McMillan and Dave Richardson (39).</p>
<p>That pair came together after India removed Hansie Cronje (41) and Shaun Pollock (1) in the first 10 overs of the day. Wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia took his fourth catch of the innings to remove Cronje to reach the landmark of 50 test dismissals.</p>
<p>However India's woes increased when the keeper suffered a gash above the eye while fielding and was unable to take his place as opener.</p>
<p>Leg spinner Anil Kumble conceded 100 runs in a test innings without taking a wicket while Ganesh's 23.5 overs cost 93 runs.</p>
<p>India face a long haul to get back into the series having lost the first of the three tests by 328 runs.</p>
