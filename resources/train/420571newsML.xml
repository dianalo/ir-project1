<p>Moves by Britain's ruling Conservative Party to replace the country's tax-funded pension system with fully-funded personal schemes were inevitable, and critical to the future health of the economy, industry analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Pandora's Box has been opened. There is no way that the state can meet the ballooning pensions burden that is due to come up in the next century,&quot; Blake Dempster, chief executive of Liberty International Pensions, a major UK pensions group, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The changes come amid a growing demographic crisis in Europe -- fewer workers of employment age funding the retirement of an ageing population.</p>
<p>The World Bank estimates that the percentage of the British population over 60 will rise to nearly 30 percent by 2030 against 20.8 percent in 1990.</p>
<p>Added to this, people are living longer.</p>
<p>Reaction to the announcement was mixed, but most players agreed that an overhaul was inevitable.</p>
<p>Dempster says there will have to be an overhaul of the system even if the Conservatives fail to win the election, which must be held by May 22. The new scheme is similar to Labour's stakeholder pension scheme announced recently.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just a question of how much stays in the state and how much gets passed out,&quot; he said, adding that he believed the scheme was workable.</p>
<p>&quot;Essentially it seems to be well conceived.&quot;</p>
<p>In terms of the Basic Pension Plus scheme announced on Wednesday, all young people entering the workforce and those in their early twenties would have their own pension fund.</p>
<p>Existing pensioners and the current workforce would not be affected, and the state guarantees that no-one will be worse off under the new scheme.</p>
<p>Participants would receive a nine pound-a-week rebate on the national insurance (NI) contributions which would be invested in their personal fund, managed by a firm of their choice.</p>
<p>They will be contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), and receive a second rebate of five percent of their earnings to fund another scheme related to earnings. They would be encouraged to invest more than the minimum.</p>
<p>Low earners with NI contributions under nine sterling ($14.5) a week would still get the full amount paid into their scheme, while those who currently get credits to their basic pension would continue to do so.</p>
<p>The current system of taxation of pensions would be reversed, with contributions paid from after tax income instead of the current system of taxing of pension income.</p>
<p>The cost of the guarantee is not significant for the state, and it would cause major reductions in social security spending progressively after 2040. The scheme estimates a saving of some 40 billion sterling eventually.</p>
<p>The Association of British Insurers said the scheme had merit and was far-sighted, but there were still many questions to answer and points to be clarified, including the change in taxation which it said could discourage putting extra money into pensions.</p>
<p>The National Association of Pension Funds said the changed tax system could mean occupational schemes would have to operate under two different tax regimes, which would be administratively complex, but welcomed the scheme overall.</p>
<p>Dempster said the key to the scheme was that it would be low cost, which was only attainable if the right technology was in place.</p>
<p>The Adam Smith Institute, a right-leaning thinktank, said the move towards a fully funded system was &quot;a staggering leap to prosperity for the ordinary people of Britain&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the scheme would spark a strong rise in the savings ratio and build up a large investment pool.</p>
<p>When the scheme is mature, it predicts providers will be competing for a market of some 60 billion sterling. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds Sterling)</p>
