<p>Indian shares finished mixed on Tuesday helped by foreign fund buying in multinational stocks but big-cap local blue-chips fell, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a mixed trend,&quot; said Sanjeev Choithani, chief dealer at Bombay brokerage Pashupati Advani. &quot;The market was down for most of the day on position unwinding.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said arbitrage trades based on price differentials at the Bombay and National exchanges helped push prices higher at close on the Bombay bourse.</p>
<p>The benchmark Bombay share index closed 14.94 points, or 0.35 percent, higher at 4,306.39, after hitting 4,252.49.  </p>
<p>Some of the multinational shares that rose were: Castrol, Cadbury's, Colgate, Nestle, P&amp;G, Pfizer, Parke Davis, German Remedies, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals and Reckitt &amp; Colman.</p>
<p>&quot;Only the FIIs (foreign institutional investors) are buying,&quot; said Shailesh Merchant, a Bombay broker.</p>
<p>Traders said curbs on fresh FII purchases in HDFC and Infosys imposed by the central bank on Monday triggered a speculative sell-off.  </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India said foreign portfolio holdings in the two firms had reached a 26 percent watch-list limit and fresh purchases would need the bank's prior approval.</p>
<p>The ceiling on FII stakes in the two firms is 30 percent.</p>
<p>HDFC fell 221 rupees to 4,311 and Infosys lost 49.75 to 2,120, both provisional closings.</p>
<p>Traders said they expect the market to show a steadier trend on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow we could see a steadier trend,&quot; said Vijay Pandya, chief dealer at Classic Share and Stock Brokers.</p>
