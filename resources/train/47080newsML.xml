<p>The merger of the container shipping interests of Britain's P&amp;O and Nedlloyd Groep of the Netherlands is expected to be vetted by the European Commission under its fast-track merger rules, Commission sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But they would not speculate about whether the Commission would use the oportunity to force long-sought changes to the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA), an alliance for the regular transport of containers between Europe and North America, which includes both companies.</p>
<p>The Commission has often said that TACA violates EU competition rules, but conference members have so far resisted any changes.</p>
<p>The merger between The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co (P&amp;O) and Nedlloyd does not at first glance appear large enough to fall under the EU's merger rules.</p>
<p>The EU has to clear all mergers and acquisitions involving a worldwide turnover of at least five billion European currency units ($6.25 billion) and a European turnover threshold of 250 million Ecus.</p>
<p>The companies said in a statement on Monday that their combined turnover was &quot;nearly $4 billion&quot;. An official at Nedlloyd said this was worldwide, but the Commission sources said contact had been made with the companies to get a better idea of the total worldwide turnover involved.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the two companies will merge their container shipping business in a 50-50 joint venture to be called P&amp;O Nedlloyd Container Line.</p>
<p>A Commission official said it appeared that only the turnover of the joint venture had been taken into account and that it might be necessary to include part of the remaining turnover of the parent companies.</p>
<p>The Commission has been trying to change the TACA agreement since an earlier version called Trans Atlantic Agreement (TAA) was submitted for vetting in August 1992.</p>
<p>It particularly accused the companies involved of colluding to keep door-to-door prices on sea container transport artificially high. ($1 = 0.80 Ecu)</p>
