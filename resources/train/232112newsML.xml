<title>UK: NWE fuel oil eyes French strike, Russian supplies.</title>
<headline>NWE fuel oil eyes French strike, Russian supplies.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE fuel oil was steady to firmer on Tuesday gaining support from crude's recent rises.</p>
<p>Dealers were keeping a wary eye on Elf's labour dispute and Russian straight run avails.</p>
<p>Day six of the strike at Elf was causing concern, but there has been no large scale buying.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges moved up by $4 a tonne with trades at $125 and $126 fob ARA. Dealers said a growing shortage of product has help boost prices which settled in this range around midday. Moderate to fair bunker demand of 10-15,000 tonnes was also giving some support.</p>
<p>The high sulphur cracked cargo market was now looking more comfortable above $120 cif NWE with a definite tightness of supplies. But, demand was not especially visible and a number of end-users claim to have enough material for much of December.</p>
<p>The good availability of Russian straight run continues as does the the uncertainty as to when or indeed whether an export tariff will be applied. E-4 appear to be plentifully offered.</p>
<p>The low sulphur cracked cargo market was steady around $133 fob NWE with a second half 45-50,000 tonne cargo looking for $135 fob. A smaller 25,000 tonne cargo was no longer on the market and some dealers believe it is destined for the Med.</p>
