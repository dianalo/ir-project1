<p>The owner of Australia's most profitable casino, Crown Ltd, declined on Tuesday to name its price for buying back the management rights to the operation, but sources said the sum could approach A$300 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks are only in the initial stages and there's not been any discussion of a price or timing yet,&quot; a Crown spokesman told Reuters. Earlier on Tuesday, Crown announced it was negotiating with the casino's manager and its major shareholder, Hudson Conway Ltd, to buy back the management rights.  </p>
<p>But a company source and stock analyst said the management rights would be worth more than the A$240 million paid by the nation's biggest gambler, businessman Kerry Packer, for the management rights to the Sydney Harbour Casino this month.</p>
<p>Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd bought the management rights from U.S.-based casino operator Showboat Inc. The price is reported to have been six and a half times the annual management fee.</p>
<p>One stock analyst said that, based on forecast management fees at Crown Casino for 1997/98 (July/June), the same multiple would value the management rights at over A$260 million.  </p>
<p>Under the terms of the Crown Casino management contract, Hudson Conway is entitled to two percent of gross revenue and five percent of total income before fixed charges.</p>
