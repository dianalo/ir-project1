<headline>Iran eases forex rules to help falling rug exports.</headline>
<dateline>TEHRAN 1997-02-17</dateline>

<p>Iran decided on Monday to ease tough currency exchange rules that have stifled Persian carpet exports, Tehran's second cash earner after oil, state-run Tehran radio said.</p>
<p>It said a high state council which regulates consumer and exchange markets voted to rescind, effective Wednesday, rules which force carpet exporters to return all but 30 percent of their hard cash income to Iran and exchange it at an unfavourable official rate in state banks.</p>
<p>The currency restrictions were blamed for rug exports tumbling to $968 million in the Iranian year which ended on March 19, 1996 from $1.6 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>The decision, taken at a meeting headed by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, follows the approval by the parliament last month of a law to the same effect which would have taken effect on March 21.</p>
<p>The Guardian Council, a body of clerics and lawyers which vets parliamentary decisions, earlier this month approved the law despite opposition from the government.</p>
<p>Government officials had warned that the law, which allows exporters to keep their hard cash income and use it to import raw materials for carpet production and other goods, would weaken the Iranian currency and cause other economic problems.</p>
<p>The state council also approved new rules which allow each air traveller to take rugs measuring up to a total of 12 square metres (129 sq ft) out of the country without paying duties, the radio said. The earlier allowance was three square metres.</p>
<p>The regulations were imposed in 1995 to stop a flight of hard currency after the Iranian rial plummeted after the announcement of United States sanctions against Iran.</p>
<p>The government has in the past year partially yielded to pressures from carpet dealers and announced it was easing some aspects of the regulations.</p>
<p>Traders and newspapers have expressed concern over the fall of the exports and called for measures to support the carpet weaving industry which employs about two million people.</p>
