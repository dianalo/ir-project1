<p>Polish life insurer  Amplico Life SA lifted its net profit to 18.6 million zlotys last year from 5.1 million zlotys in 1995, the company's president said on Friday.</p>
<p>Georges Dourte told a news conference Amplico Life's gross premium rose to 205.9 million zlotys last year from 85.7 million zlotys in 1995 and that it had gained a 7.5 percent market share. In 1995 the firm's market share was estimated at about 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>It said the number of clients doubled last year to 244,489.</p>
<p>Dourte said the company would see similar growth this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue for sure at the cruising speed we were enjoying in 1996. Our strategy for 1997 is that we continue at the same speed of expansion across the country,&quot; Dourte said.</p>
<p>Amplico is 55-percent owned by the U.S.-based American Insurance Group (AIG) and 45-percent owned by Polish state-owned Bank Pekao SA, which last year raised the firm's share capital to 11 million zlotys from two million zlotys.</p>
<p>Amplico also lifted its technical result last year to 13.6 million zlotys from 2.5 million zlotys in 1995 and increased revenues from investment to 27.4 million from 10.7 million.</p>
<p>Kendall Nottingham, AIG senior vice president, would not comment on rumours that Pekao would pull out of Amplico.</p>
<p>&quot;We really have no comment on the future nature of that relationship which I think will be largely driven by Polish government decisions and reorganisations that have yet to be announced,&quot; Nottingham told the news conference.</p>
<p>Pekao has formed a group with three other state-owned commercial banks and its privatisation is slated for next year. It has been also named among potential investors in the state-owned Powszechny Zaklad Ubezpieczen (PZU) insurer, which plans to start its privatisation by offering new shares to selected institutions.</p>
<p>Nottingham told Reuters Amplico would have no problems operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary, if necessary.</p>
