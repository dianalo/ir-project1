<p>The Cahners Business Confidence Index (CBCI) rose to 66.6 in January from 66.2 the month before, Cahners Economics said.</p>
<p>&quot;With CBCI just slightly above its 12-month average, the business community seems to be telling us they see calm waters and clear sailing ahead for the early months of 1997,&quot; said Cahners economist Kim Kennedy, who prepared the report.</p>
<p>Of the seven CBCI components, the employment index rose most strongly in January, climbing 1.7 points to stand at 66.7. The research and development index turned in the second-best performance, rising to 64.7 from 63.4 the month before.</p>
<p>&quot;January's only significant decline was in new product introductions, which, at this late stage in the business cycle, might be expected,&quot; Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Product introductions fell to 72.0 from 73.2.</p>
<p>Regionally, confidence was strongest in the West, at 68.4. Confidence fell off somewhat in the South, to 65.7 in January from 68.4 in December.</p>
<p>Most survey respondents said 1997 economic conditions will be much like those of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth will remain in the moderate 2.0- to 2.5-percent range, with both interest rates and inflation remaining subdued,&quot; Kennedy said.</p>
