<p>Digital Equipment Corp Chief Financial Officer Vin Mullarkey said he expects &quot;an imminent&quot; agreement to restructure and downsize operations in either France or Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The areas that have the most work to do...with respect to restructuring happen to be Germany and France,&quot; he said. &quot;Because we have been involved in these discussions for an extended period of time to date, we have fallen behind in terms of the restructuring adjustments required.&quot;</p>
<p>Efforts to downsize operations in those two countries, as Digital has done worldwide, have been hampered by the countries' complex labour laws and strong unions, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd rather not be specific, but I think that in one case it's imminent, in another case I don't know when it is, hopefully soon,&quot; Mullarkey told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He declined to say if the imminent agreement was either in France or Germany, but said he hopes the deal and its implementation could be wrapped up in &quot;a couple of quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>Digital has continually downsized over the last few years from 95,000 jobs in 1990 and, in the lastest quarter, cut about 1,100 jobs to 55,900 employees worldwide.</p>
<p>The $14 billion computer company announced plans in 1994 to cut 2,000 jobs from its German unit as part of its broader plan to eliminate 20,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Dozens of workers from Digital's units in Europe showed up at the company's annual meeting in Boston in November to protest the company's downsizing and growth strategy.</p>
<p>Digital's highly public efforts to trim its operations in France and Germany contributed to weaker than expected results from Europe in the second quarter ended December 28, he said.</p>
<p>The continent accounted for about 45 percent or about $1.5 billion of its total operating revenues of $3.36 billion in the second quarter, he said.</p>
<p>Weaker results from France and Germany overshadowed good returns from the United Kingdom and Italy, he said.</p>
<p>Mullarkey said he was encouraged from recent third quarter sales of computer systems powered by its 64-bit Alpha microprocessor, and expected those sales to show a year-over-year rise in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very much encouraged about the front-log in sales activity that's going on in the marketplace,&quot; Mullarkey told Reuters in an interview. &quot;These are orders that are pending to close. Both sequentially and year-over-year, I would expect to see improvement in growth in the second half,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Digital reported just one percent growth year-over-year in the second quarter in Alpha sales.</p>
