<p>Poland's KGHM Polska Miedz SA copper firm's offering is overpriced at its 19.5-zloty minimum institutional price because of uncertainty over the company's cost-cutting plans, Raiffeisen Zentralbank London unit said.</p>
<p>Trading in 150 million KGHM shares is due to start on the Warsaw Stock Exchange on July 10.</p>
<p>Raiffeisen said in a report dated June 29 that its analysis focused on KGHM's ability to reduce costs, which is crucial to the firm's longer-term performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the stock will be issued at a minimum institutional price of 19.50 zloty, we believe 15 zloty is closer to its natural long-term value,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said that in the short term the issue should prove successful because of high investor interest in the Polish market in general and KGHM's high liquidity and its blue-chip status.</p>
<p>Raiffeisen said however the higher valuations presented by other analysts were based on KGHM management's forecasts of cost reductions, which it considered as too optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;KGHM is a comparatively high cost producer. An ambitious cost reduction plan forms a central plank of its future strategy. However, we believe these cost reduction plans are optimistic,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Raiffeisen listed as KGHM's strengths a relatively high proportion of high margin products and by-products, its proximity to its major markets and virtually debt-free balance sheet.</p>
<p>Among KGHM's main weaknesses it named reserve levels possibly lower than earlier estimated, the need to move deeper with mining operations which would put costs under pressure and a strong representation of employees and the state in the shareholder structure.</p>
