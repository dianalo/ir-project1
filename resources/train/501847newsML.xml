<headline>German shares tread water in mid-session bourse.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares opened bourse trade on Thursday slightly lower, shedding some of the gains made in the DAX index's recent recovery after Wall Street ended lower overnight and the dollar lost ground against the mark.</p>
<p>By mid-session bourse trade the dollar had stabilised and the DAX index of German blue-chips pulled back to stand almost unchanged from Wednesday's close, down 1.82 points, or 0.05 percent, at 3,357.64 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar couldn't hold its highs and then the lower Wall Street also hit. There's a bit of consolidation there all right, but the market isn't doing too badly,&quot; a trader in Frankfurt said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said that volumes in the market were very low and that even small orders were able to move the market appreciably.</p>
<p>The car sector was higher than the average, continuing a trend seen of late. Volkswagen AG was up 44.50 marks, or 4.73 percent, at 986 marks after the carmaker forecast that its 1997 profits would outpace sales growth.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz was up 1.60 marks, or 1.23 percent, at 131.60 marks, while BMW AG, a market favourite on Wednesday, was up 23 marks, or 1.61 percent, at 1,425 marks.</p>
<p>Other features in bourse trade included Hypo-Bank, which fell earlier on after a downgrade and was down 3.90 percent, 2.08 points, to 53.32 marks.</p>
<p>Sportswear maker Adidas AG was up 4.90 marks, or 2.73 percent, at 183.90 marks after it reported a 43 percent increase in first-quarter 1997 sales to 1.7 billion marks.</p>
