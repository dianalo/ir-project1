<p>U.S. Energy Secretary Federico Pena said Wednesday he hoped to hold a meeting within about two weeks with utilities and other plaintiffs in a lawsuit against his department over its obligation to store nuclear power reactor waste.</p>
<p>Pena, speaking to reporters after a House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, also said he wanted to be ready to start discussing the government's options since it will not have a storage facility ready to accept the spent nuclear fuel by the January 31, 1998, deadline.  </p>
<p>&quot;I want to hopefully be in a position to begin to discuss options on how to address the litigation and the obligations we have,&quot; Pena said.</p>
<p>Pena said &quot;the general attitude&quot; was to meet with parties and plaintiffs to the lawsuit filed by utilities, states and local commissions.</p>
<p>&quot;I want this to be a working meeting where we can have a direct discussion on the litigation,&quot; he said, adding that he did not know if lawyers would have to be involved.</p>
<p>The department, under a 1982 law, is obliged to take responsibility for the radioactive waste next year.  </p>
<p>Utilities, which generally are storing the waste onsite, have paid some $12 billion into a fund for the department to build a central storage facility, but the department still is assessing the viability of the one site in Nevada under consideration as a storage site. That site is not expected to be ready before 2010 or 2015.</p>
<p>&quot;That looming court decision isn't going to go away,&quot; Pena said after courts last year agreed with the utilities that the department assumes responsibility for the waste on January 31.</p>
<p>Pena said the department has started reviewing suggestions that utilities submitted on how to deal with the waste issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I know some have just taken the position that this is not our responsiblity. Thank you for giving us a chance to submit written comments, but this is your problem. But others apparently have made some effort to look at it,&quot; Pena said.</p>
<p>The Senate after recess is to take up a bill that would build a temporary waste dump to start accepting waste more quickly, but the Clinton administration has threatened to veto that because it says the measure would drain resources from building a permanent dump.</p>
