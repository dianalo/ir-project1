<headline>FORECAST - Heat on S.Electric over strategy.</headline>

<p>Britain's only remaining independent regional electricity company (Rec), Southern Electric Plc will be under pressure to address its balance sheet when it reports an anticipated dip in year profits on June 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearer indications on strategy could be helpful. The company has a strong balance sheet with gearing around 23 percent, so it has the capacity to return value,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Southern Electric is expected to turn in pre-tax profits before exceptionals in a wide range of 227 to 275 million stg, compared with 283 million previously.</p>
<p>It should pay out a dividend of 21.5 pence to 23.4 pence, compared with an adjusted 20.8 pence a year ago to take account of a share reorganisation during the year.</p>
<p>The lower profits will reflect the impact of the first full year of a tough distribution price review, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Southern is just not maximising value, it is lightly geared and it needs to do something,&quot; another analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts will be watching for indications that the company might be interested in an acquisition or could return further value to shareholders.</p>
<p>It backed out of a bid war for Southern Water last year, allowing multi-utility Scottish Power to snap the company up for 1.68 billion stg.</p>
<p>Its own ambitions to merge with a generator were frustrated over a year ago when the government blocked its agreed deal with National Power.</p>
<p>It is now the only remaining independent Rec after the other 11 set up at privatisation in 1990 were snapped up in a flurry of bids after the government's protective share lapsed in early 1995.</p>
<p>But analysts said Southern remained an unpalatable target for many companies because of its size and track record.</p>
<p>Estimates suggest a bid would have to be over two billion stg to secure the company.</p>
<p>In addition, the management team is considered strong and &quot;fiercely independent,&quot; the first analyst said.</p>
