<p>-- Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed up across the board on Wednesday, with turnover falling to 6.11 million lots from 9.78 million on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the shortest three-day contract ended up at 15.20 percent from 13.00 and the most active seven-day contract closed slightly up at 10.15 percent from 10.10.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders said the rises today were mainly due to a rising domestic A share market. The A share index closed up 1.25 percent at 832.926 points today after a few days of losses.  </p>
<p>&quot;Many investors expect the A market to continue a rally in the next few days,&quot; a trader said. &quot;Some institutions took money out of the repo market today, pushing up the rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Most contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai closed down on Monday on a technical correction after surges in the past few days, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active three-year bond maturing in August 1999, which made its debut yesterday, fell to 105.50 yuan from 105.86 on profit-taking after a surge on the first day of trading.</p>
<p>Combined market volume shrank to 4.64 million lots from 12.1 million. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004</p>
