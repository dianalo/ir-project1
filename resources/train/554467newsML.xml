<headline>Israel's Solel Boneh plans Tel Aviv offering.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israel's leading construction contractor, Solel Boneh Building &amp; Infrastructure Ltd, is planning an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, a company spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The company has filed a draft prospectus with the exchange based on its 1996 financial results and therefore has until the end of May to hold the offering, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the company had begun talks with Israel's securities authority over the size and other details of the offering. It is also in talks with prospective underwriters.</p>
<p>Israel's Haaretz newspaper said the offering would value the company at 500 million shekels but the spokesman said he could not comment on the figure.</p>
<p>The firm cancelled plans for an offering in 1994 after share prices on the Tel Aviv market plunged.</p>
<p>The company had turnover of 1.7 billion shekels in 1995. It is a subsidiary of Housing &amp; Construction Holding Co.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Housing &amp; Construction had taken a decision to seek partners for its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Arison Investments, the Israeli investment arm of billionaire businessman Ted Arison, bought 21 percent of Housing &amp; Construction last year from the group's workers, who own most of Housing &amp; Construction.</p>
<p>($1=3.41 shekels)</p>
