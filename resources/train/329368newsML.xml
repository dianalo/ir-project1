<p>Taiwan joblessness hit a 10-year high in 1996 during an economic slowdown caused in part by tensions with China, but economists said on Thursday the rate was likely to fall in 1997 as a recovery gathers steam.</p>
<p>The rate averaged 2.6 percent in 1996, the highest since it hit 2.66 percent in 1986, the cabinet's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics disclosed on Thursday.</p>
<p>In December alone, the rate was 2.6 percent, an improvement over November's 2.86 percent and well below the 10-year monthly high of 3.19 percent set in August.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment in 1997 will decline as the worst was seen in 1996 and it's over,&quot; said Nikko Securities research head Michael Hung.</p>
<p>&quot;Private consumption this year will rise, boosted by a rallying stock market, and domestic demand will rise due to the government's decision to speed up public construction projects,&quot; Hung said.</p>
<p>The government is expected to launch T$500 billion (US$18.2 billion) worth of public construction projects in 1997, economists said.</p>
<p>Rising capital goods imports suggest growing manufacturing confidence, experts added.</p>
<p>&quot;Capital goods imports have increased significantly in recent months, indicating a gradually recovering economy, and this too will increase new employment,&quot; said Nomura Securities analyst Amy Huang.</p>
<p>Both economists forecast 1997 joblessness at 2.5 percent -- echoing recent official projections of improving employment.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not make forecasts, but the Council for Economic Planning and Development has said it hoped to hold the jobless rate between 2.0-2.5 percent,&quot; Chao Hung-ching, a statistics directorate section chief, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the jobless rate this year will be slightly lower than 1996 if the economic recovery continues,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The directorate forecast in November that Taiwan's gross domestic product would grow 6.2 percent in 1997, up from recent indications that GDP growth in calendar 1996 would come in at 5.7 percent when officially announced in February.</p>
<p>Nomura also is forecasting 1997 GDP will rise 6.2 percent, while Nikko is even more bullish with a 6.6 percent forecast -- far below the 1980s' heady &quot;Asian dragon&quot; years of double digit growth and further indicating Taiwan's economic maturity.</p>
<p>The directorate attributed the high 1996 jobless rate to an economic slowdown that increased local business closures.</p>
<p>Economists also attributed the relatively high joblessness to a conservative business reaction to tensions with China, Taiwan's rival since a Chinese civil war ended in 1949.</p>
<p>China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, launched months of war games and missile tests near Taiwan to cool what it saw as growing ardour for independence before the island's unprecedented direct presidential election in March 1996.</p>
<p>Economists said the easing of Taiwan-China tensions since March 1996 has helped the island's long-awaited economy recovery. (US$ = T$27.5)</p>
