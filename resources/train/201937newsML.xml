<p>According to Dutch lore, people in Rotterdam are born with their sleeves rolled up, signifying that, while Amsterdam is the Netherlands' cultural and artistic centre, the great western port city is its industrial heart.</p>
<p>The same distinction could easily apply to the two sides who clash in the Dutch first division on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Feyenoord, the artisans or rough diamonds of Dutch soccer versus aristocratic Ajax Amsterdam, the nation's &quot;Culture Club&quot;.</p>
<p>The intense rivalry, often bordering on naked hatred, that exists between these two clubs reflects the cultural divide between the Netherlands' two biggest cities.</p>
<p>The added twist this year is that Feyenoord, for once, are in the ascendency.</p>
<p>The Rotterdam club trail league leaders PSV Eindhoven by a single point, while Ajax, 26 times national champions, are languishing in sixth place, nine points adrift of Feyenoord.</p>
<p>After two years of total domination -- of Europe as well as the Netherlands -- Ajax are in free-fall.</p>
<p>In contrast, Feyenoord, who have had to play second fiddle to Ajax for too long, re-built during the summer close season and have assembled a team that, despite a bizarre 7-2 drubbing last month, looks capable of pushing PSV all the way.</p>
<p>While statistics show Ajax have won eight of the last 10 league meetings between the two sides in Rotterdam, including the last five, they do not account for the air of grim desperation that hangs over the Amsterdam club.</p>
<p>The young and talented team that conquered Europe in 1995 and again reached the European Cup final last season, has been hobbled by transfers to the more lucrative Italian and Spanish leagues and decimated by injuries.</p>
<p>Sunday evening's game is the first league meeting between the two sides since Ajax triumphed 2-0 in Amsterdam in March with goals from Jari Litmanen and Patrick Kluivert.</p>
<p>The corresponding fixture in Rotterdam last season saw Clemens Zwijnenberg and Henryk Larsson put Feyenoord 2-0 up inside seven minutes, before Ajax stormed back to win 4-2 on their way to a third successive championship.</p>
<p>Rotterdam fans are only too well aware that Ajax have double Feyenoord's tally of 13 Dutch titles and it is four years since the Rotterdam club won the league -- and that was after a 10-year gap during which PSV and Ajax dominated.</p>
<p>Ajax's recent European and World Club Cup successes are also too fresh in Rotterdam minds for comfort.</p>
<p>Feyenoord are in the third round of the UEFA Cup and will be looking to improve on last season's campaign when they reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
<p>But European progress will be off the agenda on Sunday, as the two old rivals slug it out for league points.</p>
<p>The bitter rivalry between the two camps has in the past spilled over into violence with drunken fans fighting pitched battles outside the grounds. One Amsterdam policeman was forced to brandish his firearm in an attempt to quell skirmishing fans.</p>
<p>Six years ago, a teenage Feyenoord fan was jailed for hurling a home-made bomb which injured over a dozen rival fans at an Ajax-Feyenoord game.</p>
<p>Today, supporters of both clubs are routinely segregated long before kick-off, and the ugly physical confrontations of the 1970s and 1980s have largely disappeared, replaced by tasteless chanting from the terraces.</p>
<p>Feyenoord fans traditionally target Ajax's Jewish roots, making a hissing sound like gas escaping at World War Two concentration camps, and Ajax coach Louis van Gaal has been the butt of unpleasant personal verbal abuse.</p>
<p>This off-field antagonism between the two camps has also meant that few players have played for both Ajax and Feyenoord.</p>
<p>Johan Cruyff is a notable exception and two of the current crop -- Ajax's Arnold Scholten and Feyenoord's Ronald Koeman -- will be playing against their former club on Sunday.</p>
<p>As a footnote, gleeful Rotterdam fans claim to have buried a Feyenoord flag beneath the pitch during construction of Ajax's new stadium, resulting in Ajax's dramatic slump.</p>
