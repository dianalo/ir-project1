<p>GOVT SAYS PROGRESS MADE ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TARGET</p>
<p>The Federal Government says Australia has made progress in international negotiations for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Australia is opposing moves by the United States and Europe for uniform greenhouse targets, saying it would hurt Australia more than it would hurt other nations.</p>
<p>Australia is hopeful of winning the support of other nations, ahead of a meeting on climate change in Kyoto in December.</p>
<p>But Acting Environment Minister, Warwick Smith, says a meeting of eight major nations in Denver has made progress in the past few days.</p>
<p>Mr Smith says the Summit of 8's communique refers to the new climate change agreement, as needing to contain meaningful realistic and equitable targets.</p>
<p>He says this gives recognition to the need for the equitable differentiation of country targets, taking into account the economic realities of individual country circumstances.</p>

<p>FERGUSON DEFENDS LABOR'S DECISION TO BACK COMPULSORY WORK FOR DOLE</p>
<p>Federal Opposition employment spokesman, Martin Ferguson, has defended Labor's decision to back the Government on a compulsory work for the dole scheme.</p>
<p>Labor has voted with the Government in the Senate, against an Australian Democrats amendment to overturn the compulsory aspect.</p>
<p>Mr Ferguson says the nature of the program, and not compulsion, was the main issue for Labor.</p>
<p>He says Labor's capacity to create a decent scheme was destroyed when the Democrats voted with the Government against an Opposition amendment last week.</p>
<p>Mr Ferguson says Labor discussed the issue over the weekend, and has decided the work for the dole scheme is now a fact of life.</p>

<p>DETAILS RELEASED OF $1.5 BLN TIMOR SEA GAS PROJECT</p>
<p>American company Phillips Petroleum has outlined details of a proposed $1.5 billion gas project in the Timor Sea off northern Australia.</p>
<p>The project includes the construction of a liquified natural gas plant near Darwin.</p>
<p>Phillips Petroleum plans to develop the gas-rich Bayu Undan field inside the Timor Gap joint zone of cooperation, between Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>After extraction at sea, Phillips wants to pipe the gas along the sea bed to Darwin, where it intends to build a massive liquified natural gas plant.</p>
<p>The company's Eric Wiszeauckas says the gas would be sold in Asia.</p>
<p>Mr Wiszeauckas says Phillips sees this as a key growth project for its worldwide portfolio.</p>
<p>If project approval is given, construction on the pipeline and gas plant could start as early as 1999.</p>

<p>MOORE SAYS HIGH COURT CHALLENGE TO ANDREWS BILL INEVITABLE</p>
<p>The High Court could be asked to determine to draw a line between assisted suicide and active voluntary euthanasia, if legislation planned for the ACT is enacted.</p>
<p>ACT Independent Michael Moore is drafting laws describing six degrees of voluntary euthanasia, in an effort to circumvent the Federal Andrews legislation.</p>
<p>The Andrews legislation outlaws voluntary euthanasia, and some members of the Northern Territory and ACT Parliaments have been trying to draft laws to get around it.</p>
<p>Mr Moore's proposed six degrees range from assisted suicide, carrying an eight-year prison term, to computer-assisted suicide under medical supervision, carrying a fine of $50.</p>
<p>Mr Moore says a High Court challenge would be inevitable.</p>
<p>He says the Court would have to decide whether the final three degrees in any sense have the effect of permitting voluntary-active euthanasia.</p>

<p>CHARITY SAYS AIDS-RELATED POVERTY ON THE RISE</p>
<p>Australia's biggest AIDS charity says demand for its services is continuing to hit record levels.</p>
<p>The Bobby Goldsmith Foundation says last year the demand for financial assistance for its clients rose dramatically.</p>
<p>The trend has continued with May 1997, the busiest month ever.</p>
<p>Client Services Manager, Mark Tietjen, says AIDS-related poverty is on the increase.</p>
<p>Mr Tietjen says there are many people who have been living on a pension for some years, who despite believing they would experience declining health, still require ongoing support.</p>
<p>He says many of these people are not necessarily involved in new treatments.</p>

<p>STUDY FINDS HOMPHOBIC VICTIMISATION STILL PRACTISED IN AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>A survey at Sydney's Macquarie University has found that homophobic victimisation is still being practised widely throughout Australia.</p>
<p>The findings also found that young men under the age of 20 had experienced a higher level of victimisation than other age groups.</p>
<p>The paper, prepared by the National Centre in HIV Social Research, was carried out at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Author Dr Paul Van de Ven says 14-per cent of the men surveyed had experienced HIV-related abuse, and 39-per cent homophobic victimisation.</p>
<p>He says while bashings are the least common experience of victimisation, almost six-per cent of those surveyed still said they had been physically assaulted during this period.</p>
<p>Dr Van de Ven says men under the age of 20 experienced the highest level of victimisation, with more than two thirds saying they had either been physically or verbally intimidated.</p>
<p>He says the findings reflect badly on our society, and that if any other group had the same experiences, it would quite properly be the subject of a Royal Commission.</p>
