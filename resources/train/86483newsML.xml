<p>The investigation into Wickes Plc's accounting irregularities is expected to implicate up to four more current or former senior executives of the home improvements retailer, Sunday's Observer newspaper reported. A letter detailing the findings of accountant Price Waterhouse and solicitor Linklaters &amp; Paines, due at the end of September, has been delayed until next week because the investigation, commissioned by Wickes, took longer than expected, the paper said.</p>
<p>Initial findings suggest Wickes' profits were overstated by some 50 million stg, the Observer said.</p>
<p>Rebates that should have been spread over three years were taken into one year's profits, the paper said.</p>
<p>Writedowns to take account of this mean that Wickes is likly to have to launch a 30 million stg rights issue, and may have to sell some of its overseas subsidiaries, the Observer added.</p>
<p>Wickes' trading director Les Rosenthal and commercial director Chris Miles have already resigned following their suspension on June 27.</p>
<p>Shares in Wickes were suspended on June 26 after the irregularities were discovered and Wickes chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum resigned the following day.</p>
