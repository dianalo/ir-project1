<p>Iran's president-elect said on Tuesday time was ripe to ensure more democracy in the country but insisted this had to be done while defending the Islamic government against its enemies.</p>
<p>&quot;Our programme is to accept pluralism and variety of views within our system and laws while ensuring unity and solidarity against outside threats to our system of government,&quot; Mohammad Khatami told his first news conference since Friday's landslide election victory.</p>
<p>Khatami, a moderate Shi'ite Moslem cleric due to take over from President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in August, said Iran had enough stability now after its 1980-88 war with Iraq and the ensuing period of reconstruction to guarantee its 60 million citizens all constitutional rights.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the best opportunity to stabilise the groundwork of our civil society within the framework of the constitution,&quot; said Khatami whose election victory over a rival backed by the country's conservative clerical establishment was Iran's biggest political upset since the country's 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to gradually witness a more legal society...with more clearly defined rights and duties for citizens and the government,&quot; said Khatami, a former culture minister with a reputation as tolerant politician.</p>
<p>Analysts said Khatami's campaign promise to work towards establishing the rule of law had gained him wide support among intellectuals who often complain about arbitrary actions by state bodies governing press, book publishing and films.</p>
<p>Khatami said rights guaranteed under Iran's constitution -- including right to free thought, life, employment, assembly and association -- should be fully granted.</p>
<p>Analysts said Khatami's remarks were likely to arouse opposition among conservatives even though he was careful to clarify that he was only advocating changes within the Islamic republic's government system.</p>
<p>&quot;Usually when Iranian officials speak of human rights, it is to list them as guaranteed under the constitution. Khatami is saying these rights are no good if they are only on paper,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
