<p>Fresh shooting rocked the battered Congo Republic capital on Sunday, with supporters of President Pascal Lissouba and his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso apparently staking out positions ahead of a new truce.</p>
<p>Confusion reigned over when the ceasefire, initialled by the two men at the weekend, would begin.</p>
<p>U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun, who helped negotiate the truce proposed by Gabon's veteran president, Omar Bongo, said that it would start formally from midnight on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceasefire is already in place in a sense but we hope it will be fully respected beginning from Tuesday morning,&quot; he told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) from Gabon's capital Libreville, playing down sporadic shooting in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville.</p>
<p>Lissouba's spokesman Gregoire Lefouba said the truce would begin at midnight on Sunday. He played down Sunday's shelling. &quot;Since it was the last day before the ceasefire both sides appeared to be marking out their positions,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>With plans for a U.N.-sponsored, mainly African peacekeeping force taking shape, Sahnoun said talks would take place in Libreville this week after an initial meeting in Brazzaville.</p>
<p>He predicted talks should be fully under way by Tuesday or Wednesday. &quot;The most important thing is what are the ways and means to have a national reconciliation and to create an environment which will enable us to organise the elections which are due some time over the next two months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bloody showdown in the capital of the oil-producing former French colony began on June 5 when soldiers surrounded Sassou's home as part of a crackdown on private militias ahead of a now-postponed June 27 presidential election.</p>
<p>The political and ethnic clashes coupled with indiscriminate shell and rocket fire have killed hundreds of people, many of them civilians, medical workers say.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources told Reuters across the river in Kinshasa that the only real hope of ensuring a lasting ceasefire would be to persuade heavily-armed rival soldiers and militiamen on barricades across Brazzaville to leave the streets.</p>
<p>Sahnoun, a veteran Algerian diplomat, was in Brazzaville on Thursday for talks with the chief rivals. &quot;I am always very sceptical but I think this will lead to a serious outcome,&quot; he told Reuters on Saturday after the two sides had signed.</p>
<p>Sahnoun said on Saturday the militia issue would be dealt with in the talks. He said the warring parties and neighbouring countries wanted a peace force deployed, adding: &quot;It will be an important psychological factor to enhance the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Lissouba's spokesman Lefouba told Radio France International the government backed a return of peace. &quot;I have faith and have confidence that both sides understand that this is a dirty war that is neither in the interest of the Congolese people nor of those who want to govern the country in future,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sassou spokesman Francis Iboovi told French radio the nation needed a transition and a national salvation government.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no effective government today so conditions must be created to guarantee the organisation of a fair and honest election.&quot;</p>
<p>Lissouba's mandate expires at the end of August. He says the constitution allows a 90-day extension to organise elections.</p>
<p>Lissouba, Sassou and Brazzaville mayor Bernard Kolelas, a national mediator whose militia have kept out of the latest fighting, all planned to contest the July 27 election.</p>
<p>Kolelas's militia was at the heart of similar political and ethnic clashes that killed at least 2,000 people in Brazzaville after a disputed 1993 parliamentary election.</p>
