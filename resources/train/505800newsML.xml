<p>Spanish Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato said on Monday he did not see Spanish inflation picking up in the second half of the year and that the government was controlling the country's public deficit.</p>
<p>Rato, speaking in an interview with Reuters Financial Television (RFTV), said Spain would stick with its 2.6 percent official target for inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are already below (the target) in the data for March...We haven't changed our official target.&quot; Asked whether he saw a danger that inflation could pick up in the second half, he said, &quot;No. We stick with the target for time being.&quot;  </p>
<p>The interview was due to be broadcast on RFTV later on Monday.</p>
<p>Asked about policy at the Bank of Spain, which many in financial markets expect to cut interest rates this week, Rato said that the central bank was autonomous and as such he had no comment on its policy.</p>
<p>But in terms of government policy Rato said:</p>
<p>&quot;We are controlling the deficit and we are making deregulation and privatisation one of the cornerstones of our policy. In that stable macroeconomic policy, monetary policy is usually neutral and good for growth.&quot;  </p>
<p>Rato said Spain had low inflation and strong growth. &quot;It's also very healthy growth which is mainly led by investment and exports.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was important European markets decoupled from other regions, &quot;because the business cycles in Europe should be the ones that affect the most our monetary policy&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked whether European markets could decouple from the U.S., he said, &quot;I think its possible, it's already happening and it will happen much more with the (euro) single currency.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the Bonos/Bund yield spread could probably continue to narrow but declined to specify a target.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it will (narrow),&quot; he told RFTV, but added, &quot;I don't make any bets on the market. I leave the markets to bet on themselves.&quot; The spread at 1550 GMT was at 93 basis points.</p>
