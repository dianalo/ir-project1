<p>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, the world's second largest copper producer, said on Wednesday that its average realised price for copper shipments in the third quarter ended February 28 was US$1.09 a pound, up from US$1.04 in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p>BHP said profits from its copper division over the same period rose 64.7 percent to A$145 million.  </p>
<p>BHP said higher shipments were recorded during the quarter from the Escondida mine in Chile and the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea, although North American operations continued to underperform. &quot;Whilst significant gains have been achieved in some areas, financial results from the North America and metals divisions continue to be unsatisfactory,&quot; BHP said.</p>
<p>The Robinson mine in the United States and the Tintaya mine in Peru showed improvements during the quarter, although commissioining difficulties with the Kalamazoo, Arizona project adversely affected results, the company said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Initiatives to reduce costs and to generally enhance performance are in place but the modifications to the development programme at San Manuel (Arizona) will take some months to implement,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Unhedged copper shipments not finalised as of February 28 have been brought to account at US$1.05 a pound.</p>
<p>The London Metal Exchange spot price on February 28 was US$1.10 a pound, BHP noted.</p>
<p>Profit from the minerals division in the quarter rose A$1 million from the year earlier period to A$105 million.  </p>
<p>Despite the gain, BHP said higher costs and unfavourable product mixes at coal mines Australia and Indonesia combined with higher costs at its iron and manganese businesses weighed on the group's earnings, as did a stronger Australian dollar.</p>
<p>These factors were only partly offset by higher U.S. prices for coal and iron ore and increased shipments of iron ore during the quarter, BHP said.</p>
<p>Exploration and resource spending for the quarter totaled A$38 million, up from A$36 million in the year-ago period, BHP said. Of this amount, A$37 million was charged against profit.  </p>
<p>BHP earlier on Friday reported a third quarter net profit of A$378 million, up from A$223 million in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
