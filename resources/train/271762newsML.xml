<p>The presidents of 20 leading U.S. colleges have signed on to a programme to boost literacy by encouraging college students to serve as reading tutors, President Clinton said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is simply no better way to serve your country and your community than by helping children and adults to read,&quot; Clinton said in his weekly radio address.</p>
<p>In the Republican radio response, House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner of Ohio delivered a holiday message of good will, urging Americans to become more involved in their communities.</p>
<p>&quot;If we truly want to lift people out of the poverty trap, restore their dignity and give them a future full of hope and endless possibilities, we need to join hands together and do our part in our own neighbourhoods,&quot; Boehner said.</p>
<p>Clinton, following up on his re-election campaign pledge for a $2.75 billion national literacy campaign, said his &quot;America Reads&quot; initiative now had the backing of 20 college presidents who will make up a steering committee led by Robert Corrigan, president of San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>Clinton said he wanted to add five more college presidents for the committee.</p>
<p>The schools' objective will be to recruit students to work as reading tutors as part of Clinton's second term goal of mobilising an army of one million literacy volunteers.</p>
<p>At his request, Congress recently created over 200,000 new work-study jobs on college campuses. Clinton said on Saturday he wants a large portion of the jobs to be dedicated to community service, especially literacy programmes.</p>
<p>He said each of the 20 colleges have committed to dedicating half of their new federally subsidised work-study slots to students who work as reading tutors, Clinton said.</p>
<p>This step alone could provide as many 100,000 tutors, the White House said.</p>
<p>Work-study allows students, mostly from middle-class homes, to earn money to finance their education by working part-time jobs on campus or the community.</p>
<p>As an incentive to the colleges to respond to Clinton's initiative, he announced the Education Department will waive its requirement that colleges pay 25 percent of the work-study costs for students who work as reading tutors for youths.</p>
<p>&quot;With today's actions by these college presidents, and with the steps we are taking to help them, college students can now work their way through school by teaching our children to read,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is how we will take more responsibility, create more opportunity and build a stronger, more united community for all Americans.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Clinton's &quot;America Reads,&quot; announced during his four-day campaign train trip in August, Clinton said every American child should be able to read by the third grade.</p>
<p>Saturday, he said improving literacy would increase opportunity for millions of children and their families.</p>
<p>&quot;Without literacy, the history books and the job manuals are closed, the Internet is turned off, and the promise of America is much harder to reach,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
