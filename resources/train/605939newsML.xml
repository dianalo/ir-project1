<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bonds ended lower, off early firmer levels while the short end of the market continued to perform well despite the Swiss National Bank's decision to keep its discount rate unchanged at Thursday's meeting.</p>
<p>Few market participants expected the SNB to lower its discount rate. But the market was on alert after the SNB said Wednesday it would put liquidity into the market to counteract the Swiss franc's rise. Money market traders said the SNB was aggressive in early operations, with some seeing its actions as an effective easing of roughly a quarter point in money rates, although it does not strictly target any particular rate.  </p>
<p>Traders said the SNB added short-term funds at 1-3/8 percent this morning, down from the 1-5/8 percent rate seen on its operations in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Swiss federal government also set terms on a new 4-1/4 percent 2017 bond, priced at 99.00 to yield 4.326 percent. Traders had misgivings about the 20-year maturity. The allocation of 228 million Swiss francs was higher than some traders had expected.</p>
<p>Swiss bonds outperformed Bunds, with the spread for 10-year government bonds at a wide 240 basis points Thursday, as German prices fell relative to the Swiss market.  </p>
<p>-- Thursday's closing prices as follows:</p>
<p>Conf futures  CONFc1 down 10 at 120.11.</p>
<p>Comi medium-term bond  COMIc1 down five at 112.25</p>
<p>Euro Swiss francs  FESc1 up four at 98.45.</p>
<p>4-1/2 Jun 2007 bond  0#CH470458= 108.15/25 yield 3.51 pct</p>
<p>(Wednesday 108.30/40 yield 3.493 pct)</p>
