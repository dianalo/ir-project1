<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Friday it has initiated talks between the minority Moslem and Tamil communities in Sri Lanka's east in an attempt to end communal violence there.</p>
<p>The ICRC said in a statement it had arranged a meeting between Moslem community leaders and political and military leaders of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).</p>
<p>The talks took place on Thursday in Batticaloa district, 200 km (125 miles) from Colombo, after several deaths in recent communal clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time since 1990, leaders of the Moslem community met with LTTE leaders in the east,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to help both sides to discuss problems and allay fears and tensions,&quot; an ICRC spokesman said. He declined to give details of the talks.</p>
<p>At least eight Moslems and three Tamils have been killed in clashes in Batticaloa district this month, police said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the LTTE, which is fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east, claimed the clashes were provoked by the armed forces in an attempt to drive a wedge between the two communities.</p>
<p>&quot;There is growing empathy between Moslems and Tamils in relation to our struggle in Sri Lanka,&quot; LTTE spokesman Anton Rajah told Reuters from London.</p>
<p>&quot;The Moslem community is supporting the Tamil liberation struggle more and more,&quot; Rajah said.</p>
<p>Rajah said he was unable to give details of Thursday's talks arranged by the ICRC.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan police said in one instance this month, the LTTE fired mortars at the Moslem village of Ottamavadi in Batticaloa, killing two people and wounding 11.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the ethnic war, now in its 14th year.</p>
