<p>A Tajik rebel leader returned home from Afghanistan on Monday to help negotiate the release of hostages held by his fighters and a government spokesman said this could help break a week-old deadlock.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a serious advance towards ending the problem of the hostages,&quot; Zafar Saidov told Reuters in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, referring to the return of Rizvon Sadirov.</p>
<p>But there was no news on the outcome of any talks in the former Soviet republic, where the government faces tough opposition from armed groups of Islamic fighters.</p>
<p>Sadirov's brother Bakhrom is holding 15 captives in the town of Obirgam, in a mountaneous area some 80 km (50 miles) east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe.</p>
<p>The first hostages -- four United Nations military observers -- were seized last Tuesday and the rebels later captured a carload of Russian reporters and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.</p>
<p>Two Red Cross workers were captured and then released, but Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukharov, who flew in to negotiate with the hostage-takers, was seized early on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hopes that the captives would be released quickly have been dashed repeatedly and the rebels have ignored appeals from the international organisations and from Russia's Interfax news agency, whose correspondent is among the prisoners.</p>
<p>The rebel group holding the captives is headed by Rizvon Sadirov and it once fought for Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition. But its loyalties are now unclear.</p>
<p>The rebels are demanding free passage for Rizvon Sadirov and his fighters to return to Tajikistan from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Saidov did not say whether Rizvon had been accompanied by any of his Afghanistan-based fighters when he arrived in Dushanbe for the negotiations.</p>
<p>Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad Shah Masood is also helping mediate an end to the hostage crisis and a senior government source said he was now also in Dushanbe.</p>
<p>Masood's forces, who are fighting the Taleban Islamic rulers in Kabul, control the area of northern Afghanistan where Sadirov's fighters are based.</p>
<p>Tajikistan's Islamist opposition fighters have operated from bases inside Afghanistan in a four-year civil war with the secular government, although a truce has held since December.</p>
<p>Predictions of a quick end to the hostage crisis have been dashed in the past.</p>
<p>The Tajik authorities have issued almost daily statements saying the hostages would be released, but a helicopter sent on Friday to collect them returned empty.</p>
