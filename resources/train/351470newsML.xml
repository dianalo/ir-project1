<p>New York State, which projected its tax amnesty program would collect around $110 million of revenues it otherwise would not have obtained, said it took in about $51 million in the plan's first two months.</p>
<p>State tax officials said Friday that preliminary estimates of the total amount the state's second tax amnesty program collected should be available in a couple of weeks. The latest amnesty program began Nov 1, 1996, and ended Jan 31. A 1986 program took in around $400 million.</p>
<p>The 1996-1997 amnesty plan, which waived penalties and possible criminal actions for in-state and out-of-state residents and companies, collected amounts ranging from 14 cents from one individual -- a sum the state would have waived -- to $6.8 million from a company that was not based in New York, a spokesman for the state tax department said.</p>
<p>Kevin Quinn, the spokesman, added that amnesty programs typically see a last-minute rush to file forms.</p>
