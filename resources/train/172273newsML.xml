<p>The Miss World beauty pageant, which sparked feminist protests in the Indian city of Bangalore where the winner will be crowned on November 23, has arrived in the Indian Ocean island of Seychelles.</p>
<p>Welcomed by dozens of fans and the beat of African drums, more than 80 contestants came to the capital Victoria late on Wednesday to film the beachwear portion of the competition.</p>
<p>Many joined islanders in the &quot;Sega dance&quot;, featuring flimsy dress and slow, rhythmic hip movements.</p>
<p>Contestants will be taken to beaches and other beauty spots for filming of videos to be shown at the finals in Bangalore.</p>
<p>They will appear in a fashion show on Saturday and plan to take orphans to a picnic before leaving the prosperous islands, bidding to host the pageant next year.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, protesters halted traffic in Bangalore for more than three hours. They were also trying to block the event through the courts by contesting the right of the state government and Amitabh Bachchan Corp Ltd, Indian organisers of this year's contest, to hold the show.</p>
<p>But in Seychelles it was all cheers, pomp and media blitz as at least seven television crews accompanied the contestants.</p>
<p>In Bangalore, demonstrators heard more fiery speeches threatening to lay siege to the cricket stadium where Miss World will be crowned.</p>
<p>Police planned heavy security to safeguard the event, which had an estimated TV audience of two billion last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us see how many bullets and guns they will use. Can they stop over 200,000 people from storming the stadium? We will not allow the show, we are clear about that,&quot; a leader of the Mahila Jagran (Forum to Awaken Women) said after members of her organisation clashed with police.</p>
<p>The group has threatened that some members will commit suicide by self-immolation to wreck the contest.</p>
<p>Members of the opposition conservative Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party joined the protest, which dispersed after the crowd shouted slogans against the government and police for supporting the contest.</p>
