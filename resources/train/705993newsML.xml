<p>Wall Street stocks were expected to open higher on Thursday after the release of a report on June U.S. payrolls, wages and employment, market analysts said. The following are their comments:</p>
<p>PETER CARDILLO, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, WESTFALIA INVESTMENTS</p>
<p>-- &quot;This confirms the decision by the Fed yesterday as a good decision.&quot;  </p>
<p>-- &quot;The numbers are just about in line, although the rise in the unemployment number is a bit of a surprise. The four cent hourly wage rise is in line with forecasts and no big deal, so all in all these are favorable numbers and show no real wage pressures.&quot;</p>
<p>The Labor Department reported June nonfarm payrolls up 217,000, compared with a revised 166,000 in May. The June jobless rate rose to 5.0 percent from 4.8 percent.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters had estimated on average that payrolls would grow by 222,000 jobs in June. Unemployment rate was expected at 4.8 percent.  </p>
<p>MICHAEL METZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO</p>
<p>--&quot;The data couldn't be better. It was in line with expectations and the details were good. The unemployment rate was unchanged, which was good. The gain in hourly earnings was quite moderate.&quot;</p>
<p>-- &quot;On the whole, it looks like the apparent momentum for wages has slowed, which is exactly what the market was looking for. Stocks could open considerably higher. All of the sellers are out of the market.&quot;  </p>
<p>THOM BROWN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF RUTHERFORD BROWN AND CATHERWOOD</p>
<p>-- &quot;I think the payroll number was right on target, so that should be a positive for the stock market and the bond market. The pickup in the unemployment rate has to be seen as a positive for both the bond and the stock markets, and it underlines that Fed policy established yesterday with their holding the line was definitely the right way to go because we're definitely seeing a slowdown here.&quot;</p>
<p>-- &quot;... I think those numbers are certainly going to make for a good Fourth of July holiday.&quot;  </p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond jumped 28/32, its yield dropping to 6.64 percent from Wednesday's close at 6.71 percent.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 future was up 5.00 at 920.50.</p>
