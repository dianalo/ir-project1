<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Arnotts extortion threat over - police.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Arnotts extortion threat over - police.</headline>
<text>
<p>BRISBANE, Feb 25 (Retuer) - Queensland Police Detective Superintendent Ron Pickering said on Tuesday police were confident there was no longer a threat to food items as a result of the extortion threat against bakery group Arnotts Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Police and other interested agencies are confident that there is no longer a threat to foodstuffs as a result of this incident,&quot; Pickering told a news conference.  </p>
<p>However, Pickering warned consumers to be careful.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as our investigations are concerned, we are confident it (the threat) is over...but the public need to be cautious about the product they purchase,&quot; Pickering said.</p>
<p>Pickering said police had reached the decision on the basis that the extortionist had not contacted them since issuing the threat on February 3. &quot;Last Thursday, we decided to wait until Monday for any further contact from the extortionist. No contact was made,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The public appeal for the extortionist to stop by convicted murderer Ron Thomas, who the extortionist says is innocent and should be freed, was also a factor, Pickering said.</p>
<p>However, police said they would continue their investigation into the extortion. &quot;We are still treating this extortion as a major investigation,&quot; said New South wales police superintendent Jock Milroy.</p>
<p>Arnotts, which withdrew all its products from supermarkets in New South Wales and Queensland on February 14, is due to hold a press conference at 2.30 p.m. Brisbane time (0430 GMT).  </p>
<p>The extortionist threatened to poison biscuits made by Arnotts, Australia's largest biscuit maker, in the states of New South Wales and Queensland unless police involved in Thomas' case took a lie detector test.</p>
<p>The extortionist said police lied in giving evidence that resulted in Thomas serving two life sentences for a 1991 double shooting murder he did not commit.</p>
<p>Arnotts, which has dumped millions of packets of biscuits, has said the extortion threat would cost it A$5.0 million (US$3.8 million) a week in sales.  </p>
<p>Shares in Arnotts, about 70 percent owned by Campbell Soup Co, were steady at A$8.90 at 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>
