<p>Mexico's largest banking group Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival (Banacci) is expected to post a mild profit of around $0.05 per share or 44 centavos in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The average forecast was taken from a survey of three banking analysts, who had fairly similar outlooks on the performance of the bank, which will report for the first time later this month under full U.S. GAAP accounting standards.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the bank is unlikely to provide comparisons with last year under U.S. GAAP, and they said results close to their expectations would be no triumph for the bank.</p>
<p>Indeed most expected bank stocks to remain under pressure at least until second quarter data are reported.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns Latin American banking analyst Alberto Sanchez predicted a profit of four U.S. cents per share, adding that his estimates included the probable use of tax credits by Banacci.  </p>
<p>&quot;They should be making twice as much as that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said net interest margins for the banking unit, Banamex, were likely to drop 150 basis points as a result of new GAAP accounting, which prohibits banks from accumulating interest on past-due loans.</p>
<p>Its margins would also be squeezed by competition from new competition such as Banco Santander Mexicano and BBV-Probursa, and low paying Treasury assets taken by the bank as part of deals with the government to offload past-due loans.  </p>
<p>Robert Lacoursiere, banking analyst at Santander Investments, forecast a profit of seven cents per share, or 59 centavos, and said Banacci's net interest margin would slide to three percent from 3.6 percent -- less, he expected, than its main rival Bancomer.</p>
<p>However, he expected weak interest earnings to be partly offset by an improved trading income. New mark-to-market rules introduced under the U.S. GAAP guidelines may help banks because of the relative strength of the stock market in the quarter, he said.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, Banamex's underlying asset quality is likely to continue to deteriorate, which may force it to continue to create provisions.</p>
<p>For Rogelio Urrutia, bank analyst at Valores Finamex, the first quarter is likely to be the best of the year for Banamex, with a profit of 40 centavos per share. On Tuesday, he slashed his estimates for full 1997 EPS to 60 centavos from 2.20 pesos.</p>
<p>Urrutia believed the bank benefited in the first three months from &quot;the inertia&quot; of high interest rates that are likely to fall as the year wears on, putting a damper on profits in later quarters.</p>
<p>He expected Banamex's asset quality to look a bit better than Bancomer because its mortgage clients were probably more wealthy and thus not so hard hit by the 1995 economic crisis.</p>
<p>He also doubted past-due loans would increase drastically. &quot;If (clients) got through the worst of the crisis and kept paying and now the economy is improving, I don't see why they should stop paying now.&quot;</p>
