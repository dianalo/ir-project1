<p>Investment bank SBC Warburg confirmed that it had downgraded its recommendation for Italy's oil and chemical group ENI to a &quot;hold&quot; from a &quot;buy&quot; and had also trimmed its earnings forecast for 1996.</p>
<p>SBC Warburg oil analyst Gavin White in London said he had trimmed his 1996 net profit forecast by three percent down to 4.5 trillion lire due to difficult conditions during the second half of the year in the chemicals sector.</p>
<p>But White upgraded his 1997 earnings forecast for ENI by four percent to 5.0 trillion lire net profit due largely to currency factors.</p>
<p>White said he had pulled his recommendation back to a &quot;hold&quot; due to the recent strong performance of the shares and now saw a 6-9 month share price target of 9,500 lire. At 1330 GMT, ENI shares were off 2.25 percent at 8,940 lire in an overall lower Milan stock market.</p>
<p>Despite the downgrade, which the broker first released on Thursday, White stressed that ENI was still one of the investment bank's favourite oil companies.</p>
