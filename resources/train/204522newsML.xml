<p>Ford Windstar was the only passenger minivan to earn a &quot;good&quot; evaluation in new crash tests and protected its passengers far better than other vans, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The institute called Windstar the &quot;best pick&quot; among passenger vans in light of its sturdy showing in a 40 mph frontal offset crash test and the government's 35 mph frontal crash test into a flat barrier.</p>
<p>Eight other passenger vans performed poorly on the frontal test, which involves only part of a vehicle's front end hitting a deformable barrier at 40 mph.</p>
<p>The tests look at how well vehicle structure manages the energy of the crash, the risk of injury to a dummy representing an average male-size driver, and how well dummy movement is controlled during a crash.</p>
<p>In the federal test, the whole width of the vehicle slams into a rigid barrier.</p>
<p>The poorest performer overall was the Pontiac Trans Sport, said Institute President Brian O'Neill.</p>
<p>&quot;The Trans Sport was by far the worst performer in our crash test. There was massive collapse of its occupant compartment. Deformation near the driver's feet was so great that the dummy's metal foot snapped off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Similar results would be expected of the Trans Sport's twin vehicles, the Oldsmobile Silhouette and the Chevrolet Venture, O'Neill said.</p>
<p>Three other passenger vans earned overall evaluations of &quot;poor&quot; -- Toyota Previa, Ford Aerostar, and Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari.</p>
<p>Four more passenger vans evaluated by the institute earned &quot;marginal&quot; ratings -- Mazda MPV, Dodge Grand Caravan/Chrysler Town &amp; Country/Plymouth Grand Voyager, Honda Odyssey/Isuzu Oasis, and Nissan Quest/Mercury Villager.</p>
<p>O'Neill said passenger minivans generally had good on-the-road crash experience compared with other passenger vehicles because they were large and driven more often by low-risk drivers.</p>
<p>&quot;What the new crash test results reveal is that injury risk in passenger vans could be even lower if all of them performed like the Windstar,&quot; he said.</p>
