<p>Tobacco stock prices rose sharply on Wednesday amid news the tobacco industry has begun talks aimed at settling current lawsuits and providing exemption from future litigation.</p>
<p>Tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos Inc. jumped $4.375 to $43.25, while the industry's No. 2, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., was up $3.25 at $33.50. Loews Corp., which owns Lorillard Tobacco Co., ended $5.375 higher at $91.75.</p>
<p>The Tobacco Index gained 13.64, or 4.93 percent, to 290.33.</p>
<p>Tobacco executives are negotiating with state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers on a possible settlement of massive litigation against the industry, several attorneys general said Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the talks, which began about two weeks ago, are continuing in Virginia and that the lawyers hope the first round will conclude later Wednesday.</p>
<p>If an accord were reached, &quot;you're paying the plaintiffs' bar (attorneys) extortion,&quot; said Rodman &amp; Renshaw analyst Ronald Morrow. &quot;But it's very good for the industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Multiples measuring share prices against the companies' expected per-share net income for the full fiscal year could double at the very least, Morrow said.</p>
<p>The flip-side of the outlook for tobacco companies is that volume sales and volume growth would likely suffer from the additional cost on each pack of cigarettes that a settlement would require.</p>
<p>Also troubling would be the reality of selling a product with little or no advertising. Terms of the settlement under discussion are believed to call for an extreme reduction or even a termination of advertising, at which tobacco companies excel.</p>
<p>&quot;Any negative impact on the industry would come (only) from demand,&quot; said Roy Burry, analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. &quot;If prices went up, that would affect the demand for cigarettes in the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>The cost of a settlement, which could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars, could be covered with a retail price hike of anywhere from 25 cents to 50 cents per pack, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now the industry generates a total of $15 billion to $16 billion in state and federal excise taxes combined,&quot; Rodman &amp; Renshaw's Morrow said.</p>
<p>The federal excise tax on cigarettes is 24 cents per pack, while the average state excise tax is about 38 cents per pack.</p>
<p>&quot;All you have to do is double that (federal tax amount) and you're all the way there. It would generate $30 bilion a year,&quot; Morrow said.</p>
<p>The decline in the industry's volume growth from higher retail costs could grow to as much as 5 percent to 6 percent annually from the current pace of about 2 percent.</p>
<p>Stock valuations would likely soar as the heaviest negatives -- litigation uncertainty and &quot;negative noise&quot; -- would fall away under a comprehensive accord, analysts said.</p>
<p>But there is a long way to go before an actual settlement is set down in the books, and share prices will undoubtedly be volatile until that time, or until some conclusions have been reached in the current litigation wave, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm loving life here with the idea that they're moving toward this, but you can't get too excited because you've got a lot of people sitting around the table with different agendas,&quot; Morrow said.</p>
