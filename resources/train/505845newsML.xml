<p>Opponents of embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko crippled Zaire's capital Kinshasa on Monday with a stay-at-home call to back demands for him to quit, witnesses said.</p>
<p>On the war front, rebels who ended a three-day pause in their offensive, said they had captured Kananga, capital of Western Kasai province and one of the largest towns outside Kinshasa that was still in government hands.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa itself, shops, schools, and businesses were closed and public transport was off the streets as were most private vehicles.</p>
<p>Security forces deployed heavily at potential flashpoints notably opposition bastions near the Njili international airport. There were no immediate reports of incidents.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, faces a twin threat from rebels closing in from the east and south and from a Kinshasa-based political opposition emboldened by the guerrilla advances.</p>
<p>Laurent Kabila's rebels have resumed their whirlwind offensive after a three-day pause to allow Mobutu to step down honourably. Mobutu ignored their Sunday deadline.</p>
<p>Authorities in Kinshasa declared that Monday's dead-city action by the opposition was an infringement of emergency rule.</p>
<p>The general appointed prime minister by Mobutu to enforce emergency rule, Likulia Bolongo, vowed that troops would deal with militants stopping people from going to work, but the opposition played down the threat.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow is a dead city. Nobody will be on the streets, if the army wants to intervene they will have to go find people in their homes,&quot; opposition spokesman Laurent Mbayo said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Supporters of radical opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, angered by his sacking last week after only a few days in office as prime minister, were preparing for the worst.</p>
<p>Taxi drivers reported seeing youths gathering piles of tyres to be used as flaming barricades.</p>
<p>Residents of the city of over five million people rushed to stock food, sending prices soaring in markets and the handful of shops that opened on Sunday. &quot;People have been stocking up since yesterday,&quot; said Mauritanian storeowner Sidi Mohamed.</p>
<p>Kinshasa's military governor appeared on state television on Sunday to urge people to remain calm.</p>
<p>&quot;An atmosphere of panic, due essentially to the situation in the east of our country, reigns among Kinshasa's men and women,&quot; General Amela Lokima said. &quot;The most fantastic rumours according to which the city of Kinshasa would soon fall to the armed rebellion are gaining ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Lokima said the army was ready to defend Kinshasa, adding: &quot;The security of our capital is our fundamental duty.&quot;</p>
<p>Mobutu's collapsing army has been unable to check the rebel offensive that began near Zaire's eastern border last October. Kabila's forces now hold over half the country including the diamond, copper, cobalt and gold mines at its economic heart.</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of Kananga's fall.</p>
<p>In Zaire's second city, Lubumbashi, which fell to the rebels last week, a new governor took over. Kabila's financial commissioner, meanwhile, said there that the they planned to renegotiate contracts with international mining companies.</p>
<p>In the short term, the companies could continue working under existing terms, Mwana Nanga Mawampanga added.</p>
