<p>Seeking to create order from chaos, West Indies' manager Clive Lloyd has endorsed calls to institute a formal world test cricket champion.</p>
<p>This Friday in Brisbane, West Indies start a five-match series against Australia, seeking revenge for their loss in the Caribbean early last year.</p>
<p>The series is being billed locally as The Decider, a clash which will decide the unofficial world champions.</p>
<p>But, says Lloyd, why should it be unofficial?</p>
<p>&quot;We are not playing unofficial tests so something should be set up where you play for the championship of the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Test cricket is the thing. It's what you're known for. Nobody's known for doing anything in the one-day scene. Test cricket is the ultimate.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment three teams think they are world champions and I find that stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>Altogether 12 series featuring 33 tests and involving each of the nine test playing countries have been scheduled in the busiest southern hemisphere cricket season ever, in addition to the usual plethora of one-day internationals.</p>
<p>Even Matthew Engel, editor of the cricketers' bible Wisden, admits to confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm editor of Wisden and can hardly fathom what is going on where and why,&quot; Engel writes in the latest edition of Wisden Cricket Monthly.</p>
<p>&quot;What chance has the man on the Clapham omnibus, the Melbourne tram or the Rawalpindi rickshaw?&quot;</p>
<p>Engel first raised the idea of a world championship in last year's Wisden.</p>
<p>Now he revisits his original concept, saying bluntly:&quot;Test cricket is currently in disarray.</p>
<p>&quot;These mini-series make no impact outside the countries involved; they often mean little except to the most committed cricket follower, even within them. They have no context.&quot;</p>
<p>Engel's solution is simple.</p>
<p>He proposes awarding points for each series, with the winning team receiving two points and one point being awarded to each side for a drawn series.</p>
<p>&quot;All that each country has to do is to agree to play a series against every other country home and away over a four-year cycle,&quot; he writes.</p>
<p>&quot;Under this plan the championship would be continuous. Each series would remain in the table until the identical series was played in the next cycle.&quot;</p>
<p>Lloyd, Engel and all those seeking some structure to test cricket have a ray of hope.</p>
<p>International Cricket Council chief executive David Richards said the question of a world championsihp was on the council's agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;A test championship is attractive and it is a logical progression in the game,&quot; he said. &quot;It needs to be addressed and I hope it will be within the coming year.&quot;</p>
<p>In the meantime the three teams at the top of Wisden Cricket Monthly's current table are all in action this week.</p>
<p>Top-ranked South Africa meet India -- ranked fourth equal with Pakistan -- in Ahmedabad on Wednesday in the first of three tests.</p>
<p>On the same day Pakistan host last-ranked New Zealand in Lahore while on Friday Australia and West Indies, ranked joint second, play in Brisbane.</p>
