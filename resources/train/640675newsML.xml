<p>Growth in the productivity of Canadian businesses was relatively weak in 1996, linked to sluggish gains in employment and economic growth during the year, Statistics Canada said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Canada's business sector saw a 0.4 percent increase in productivity last year, the same rate of growth as in 1995 but much lower than the 2.2 percent gain recorded in 1994, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>Canadian manufacturing showed a productivity increase of 1.3 percent in 1996, much lower than the 2.8 percent growth rate in 1995, StatsCan said.</p>
<p>Productivity is a measure of production efficiency that most economists see as the foundation of a country's standard of living.</p>
<p>As for labor productivity, in 1996, U.S. manufacturers recorded 3.8 percent growth compared with only 1.1 percent growth in Canada, the federal agency said. The U.S. gain was up slightly from 1995, while the rate in Canada was virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>Unit labor costs in the business sector rose 2.8 percent for Canada, the same rate as the United States. Labor cost per unit of output reflects changes in both hourly compensation and labor productivity. The Canadian rate rose 1.4 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>In 1996, unit labor costs were higher in construction, up 5.9 percent, agriculture, up 4.6 percent, and forestry, up 4.4 percent, StatsCan said. Strong productivity growth in communication and public utilities led to a decline in unit labor costs in these industries.</p>
