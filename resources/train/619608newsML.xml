<p>With Laurent Kabila at the helm of the new Democratic Republic of Congo, international mining giants are scrambling to stake their claim in the country's minerals treasure chest.</p>
<p>Since Kabila's rebels seized the capital Kinshasa after former President Mobutu Sese Seko fled into exile, many of the world's mining giants have said they wanted to do business in the former Zaire.</p>
<p>With much of the country's mineral wealth unexplored, mining analysts say mining companies stand to gain much from investing in the country -- whose economy is in shreds after 32 years of Mobutu rule.</p>
<p>&quot;As international governments begin to announce their recognition of the Democratic Republic of Congo, those companies that entered into speculative contracts with the (Kabila's alliance) over the past months are now licking their lips,&quot; Investec Securities analyst Matthew Pearson said.</p>
<p>Zaire's vast copper and cobalt wealth is concentrated in Shaba province, which is also Kabila's home province.</p>
<p>Diamonds from Kasai province made Zaire the world's second-largest producer by volume in 1995 after Australia, while the country was the fourth-largest gold producer in Africa.</p>
<p>The country's production of copper and cobalt dropped considerably from highs in the 1980s when Zaire was one of the world's largest producers of the metals.</p>
<p>One of the companies that already secured a deal with the rebels, U.S.-based America Mineral Fields Inc., recently described the rebel victory as &quot;the triumphant liberation of the people of Zaire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Democratic Republic of the Congo is the third-largest country in Africa and is rich in natural resources. Those natural resources will be the cornerstone for the return of economic stability,&quot; AMF said.</p>
<p>AMF and Tenke Mining Corp., which is developing a mammoth $1.3 billion copper and cobalt mine in Shaba province, are poised to sink millions of dollars into copper, cobalt and zinc mines.</p>
<p>In April, AMF won the rights to buy the Kolwezi copper/cobalt tailings project and built a 200,000 ton-a-year zinc plant at Kipushi.</p>
<p>AMF, whose majority shareholder Jean Raymond Boulle made a company jet available to Kabila, was the first to be awarded a project by the rebels.</p>
<p>The move incensed mining giant Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd, which also submitted a bid to Zaire's state mining company Gecamines. Anglo has also submitted a tender to develop a copper/cobalt project at Ruashi-Etoile near the country's second-largest city Lubumbashi.</p>
<p>But Anglo and its sister company De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd may face stiff competition from other global miners.</p>
<p>Following the rebel victory, Anglo-Australian mining giant RTZ-CRA said it saw possible opportunities in the former Zaire.</p>
<p>One of the oldest companies in former colonial power Belgium, Societe Generale de Belgique SA said it saw opportunities but would proceed cautiously. SGB's 51 percent owned mining company Union Miniere used to control the copper mines in the former Zaire before Mobutu nationalised the mines. Union Miniere still has a stake in the diamond mines through industrial diamond unit Sibeka.</p>
<p>De Beers, which controls the world diamond industry through its London-based Central Selling Organisaton, recently re-opened its buying office in the diamond capital Mbuji-Mayi after pulling its buyers out during the rebel advance.</p>
<p>But De Beers had not yet re-opened its office in Kisangani.</p>
<p>Analysts said De Beers lost out to AMF's Boulle, who bought a diamond buying licence from the rebels when the South African company rejected the rebel offer.</p>
<p>Boulle's American Diamond Buyers now does brisk trade in Kisangani -- buying up to $100,000 worth of diamonds a day.</p>
<p>Analysts said they believe Zaire's mineral industry could be set for a rebirth with a new government in Kinshasa and Kabila seen as a pragmatist who realises the need for foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's scramble is reminiscent of the grab for wealth 130 years ago in this huge land, once again called the Congo,&quot; Pearson said.</p>
