<p>Singapore shares ended firmer on Tuesday but gave up much of their early gains in lacklustre trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was unexciting. It looks like it's going down again. I am not optimistic,&quot; one dealer at a local brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrial Index closed up 14.90 points to 2,060.48 points, well off its intraday high of 2,071.18.</p>
<p>The newly launched Business Times Singapore Regional Index, which has 38 component stocks, posted a maiden close of 975.49 points, up 0.18 points.  </p>
<p>There was some buying interest of selected property stocks which were at a year low but their prices did not rise substantially as there were enough sellers, one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said interest was still on Malaysian shares due to the coming budget announcement.</p>
<p>Total volume was 70.71 million shares traded. Gainers were ahead of losers 193 to 108. Singapore Press foreign led the gainers, putting on 60 Singapore cents, followed by Rashid Hussian, up 45 cents. Bukit Sembawang was down 30 cents with 18,000 shares traded. The counter was the top loser on Monday, down S$1.00 on trade of two lots. -- Raj Rajendran (65-870-3093)</p>
