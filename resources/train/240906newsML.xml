<title>ITALY: Italian President urges separatists to turn back.</title>
<headline>Italian President urges separatists to turn back.</headline>
<dateline>MANTUA, Italy 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist Northern League on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state.</p>
<p>Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua, where the party has set up its own &quot;parliament of the north&quot;, Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called &quot;my friends from the League&quot; to work instead for federal reform.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an invitation, a commitment, a promise. Let's march together,&quot; Scalfaro, a northerner himself, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Help Italy to teach, to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy, for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood. But turn back from the line you are taking now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Scalfaro was in Mantua to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity.</p>
<p>He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of League supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians who waved tricolour flags in the national red, white and green or shouted &quot;Viva Italia&quot;.</p>
<p>The League won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto Bossi later switched to a separatist agenda.</p>
<p>A three-day &quot;independence&quot; march along the Po River in September, culminating in a declaration in Venice of a self-styled &quot;Republic of Padania&quot;, flopped badly.</p>
