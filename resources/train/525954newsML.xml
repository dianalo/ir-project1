<p>France and Germany, the main motors of European integration, are clearing their decks for the EU's single currency by tackling the tough electoral issues linked to it as early as possible in both countries.</p>
<p>The early parliamentary election now expected in France would remove the threat of a &quot;second Maastricht referendum&quot; there in early 1998 just when the European Union names the members for its planned economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl reaffirmed Germany's commitment to the euro currency earlier this month by announcing -- also far ahead of schedule -- that he would run for re-election in late 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;These things are running parallel,&quot; observed Werner Becker of Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. &quot;There are similar issues in France and in Germany.&quot;</p>
<p>Next year's scheduled elections in France and Germany threatened to turn Europe's single currency into a domestic political football that could bounce in unexpected ways during the tough campaigns expected in the two countries.</p>
<p>The two sides have been consulting regularly about European policy. Chirac met Kohl over dinner in Bonn only 11 days ago and foreign ministers Herve de Charette and Klaus Kinkel plan to discuss Europe at a meeting in Hamburg next Monday.</p>
<p>Becker said both governments probably would have to risk unpopular steps like more spending cuts and tax hikes this year to keep within the Maastricht deficit targets.</p>
<p>But Chirac could take some of the sting out of the equation if, as expected, he calls forward France's poll to late May from the original March 1998 date.</p>
<p>&quot;That means they won't be campaigning in the final phase before the candidates for EMU are named,&quot; a Bonn diplomat said. &quot;That could have produced a second Maastricht referendum.&quot;</p>
<p>Former President Francois Mitterrand won a 1992 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty by only a slim majority after a clever opposition campaign eroded popular support for the plan to accelerate European integration.</p>
<p>EMU candidates are due to be named in the spring of 1998 according to whether they meet the convergence targets of a budget deficit of three percent of gross domestic product and a debt level of 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Kohl's suprise announcement on April 3 that he would run for an unprecedented fifth term next year was a clear signal registered across Europe that EMU's strongest supporter wanted to stay around to make sure it is launched on time.</p>
<p>Kohl, now Bonn's longest-serving chancellor, faces an uphill struggle to win re-election in October next year. Officials in his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) say he wanted to wait until later this year before throwing his hat into the ring.</p>
<p>Announcing his candidacy so early laid to rest speculation he might step aside for crown prince Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is less passionately pro-European than Kohl, or let public fears about the euro spread due to a lack of leadership from Bonn.</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are split over EMU and plan to wait until next April to decide whether to send the sceptical Gerhard Schroeder or more pro-European Oskar Lafontaine into the race against Kohl.</p>
<p>About three-quarters of Germans oppose giving up their deutschemark, but Kohl is building his pro-euro drive on the fact the same percentage of voters support Europe and trust him to defend Germany's interests in Brussels best.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very cynical strategy,&quot; remarked a senior banker, &quot;but it has a good chance of working.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank's Becker said Chirac's strategy was still quite risky, because he stood to lose a considerable chunk of his majority in the National Assembly and could see voters turning even more towards the far-right National Front.</p>
<p>&quot;You must also not forget the power of the street in France,&quot; he added, referring to possible labour unrest if the new government promptly jacks up taxes and cuts spending.</p>
