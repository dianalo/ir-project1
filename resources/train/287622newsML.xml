<headline>NY group says Cuomo tax cut aided poor, not Pataki.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>A non-profit research group took issue with New York State Gov George Pataki on Friday, saying that it was the tax cut enacted by former Gov Mario Cuomo that helped low-income families, not one implemented by Pataki.</p>
<p>The current governor on Thursday said that more than 450,000 New York residents were dropped from the tax rolls since 1994, when the last phase of the three-year personal income tax cut took effect on January 1.</p>
<p>The tax cuts total $3.9 billion and include more than $300 million in earned income tax credits for the working poor.</p>
<p>But the Fiscal Policy Institute, a Latham, N.Y.-based organization funded by advocacy groups and foundations, said about 84 percent of the tax reduction for these families was due to the $300 million Earned Income Tax Credit tax implemented by Cuomo.</p>
<p>The institute, in prepared remarks, said that Pataki's tax cut only raised to $22,358 the level below which families have a negative instead of a posive liablity. But the Cuomo Administration's tax cut ensured families whose annual incomes ranged from $14,150 to $21,750 owed no taxes, it added.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Pataki defended his Administration's tax reductions, and attacked the institute's neutrality.</p>
<p>&quot;The governor's tax cut has helped working families and the middle class as well as low-income people as they move off welfare rolls into workforce. The fact that a liberal organization would take exception to something the governor has done is hardly news,&quot; said Mike McKeon.</p>
<p>The institute says that it is nonpartisan.</p>
<p>Pataki on January 8 is scheduled to release his state of the state annual address, which is expected to reveal some of the broad outlines of the 1998 fiscal budget due the following week.</p>
<p>The new budget is expected to include further tax reductions.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't seen the specifics, but clearly, we want to continue to lead the nation in tax cuts. We've done it for two years in a row, we will do it again in 1997, and I don't think that should be the end,&quot; Pataki told reporters in Albany on Thursday.</p>
