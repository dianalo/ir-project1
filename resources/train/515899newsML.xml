<p>Andrew Corp said Thursday it expects its order growth to accelerate in the second half of its current fiscal year, and the company is &quot;on track&quot; to meet analysts' earnings estimates for the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We do anticipate that the order growth will accelarate in the second half,&quot; president, chairman and chief executive Floyd English said in a teleconference.</p>
<p>Andrew reported an 18 percent increase in orders in its second quarter ended March 31. English said the picked-up growth will also impact sales number.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think we have a good chance of meeting the previous six months (order growth) numbers and maybe excceding them,&quot; English said, adding in the first fiscal half the company posted a 22 percent rise in orders.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the consensus of analysts' earnings estimates for the company's current fiscal year is $1.27 a share, up from $0.98 a share in the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p>Earlier, the company reported second quarter earnings of $0.28 a share versus $0.20 last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We viewed the numbers in a positive sense and believe that we are on track for the year,&quot; English said.  </p>
<p>&quot;When we say we're on track, we're generally on track to meet analysts' expectations,&quot; English said.</p>
<p>Shares of Andrew tumbled more than 34 percent on the second quarter results, and analysts pointed to a shortfall in revenues. The company reported revenues for the quarter of $208.22 million versus $183.16 million, but analysts had expected about $230 million to $235 million, or flat with fiscal first quarter's sales of $231.66 million.</p>
<p>English said the company was surprised by what he called the market's &quot;severe reaction&quot; to the results. He said the shortfall in sales was largely &quot;a question of timing&quot;.  </p>
<p>English said revenues from Andrew's accessories business, including cases, batteries and other items related to wireless phones, were $15 million below the first quarter.</p>
<p>The strong U.S. dollar had about a $4 million negative impact versus first quarter, and a delay in some orders for PCS (personal communications services) and other wireless infrastructure cut sales sequentially by about $5 million to $10 million, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you add those numbers, I think you have more than enough&quot; to explain the lower-than-expected sales figure, English said.  </p>
<p>Accessories are typically strongest in the company's fiscal first quarter because of holiday sales, and weakest in the second quarter, English said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a significant decline and frankly a little more than we anticipated, but the December quarter strength in accessories was a little more than we anticipated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>English said the hike in interest rates delayed infrastructure sales. In March, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25 percent.  </p>
<p>Severe weather in many areas likely delayed construction and led to inventory buildup, also slowing new sales.</p>
<p>&quot;The infrastructure market has traditionally been nervous when interest rates are increased, and that causes the operators to hesitate, to review their models and capital expenditures,&quot; English said. &quot;Whether they change or not, they generally review.&quot;</p>
<p>But English said Andrew does not believe it has lost market share in any of its products, and has likely gained share in towers and shelters.</p>
<p>&quot;The question we're addressing here is really a question of timing,&quot; English said. &quot;We believe we are on track to have 1997 a good year for Andrew.&quot;</p>
