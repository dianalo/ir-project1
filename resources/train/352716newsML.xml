<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures drifted off by the close of a slow Monday session, which saw activity confined to a relatively narrow range amid a dearth of leads.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 March contract lost 170 points to end at 18,150 on light volume of 14,135 lots.</p>
<p>Dealers said the cash market's wait-and-see stance ahead of a land auction by a former Japanese state-owned railway firm in the afternoon and the dollar's uncertain outlook before a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations this week also hampered participation.  </p>
<p>A Japanese newspaper reported on Sunday that Japan would ask the G7 to help curb the yen's sharp fall against the dollar, but dealers were skeptical about the potential for a dollar decline. &quot;Most people are bullish about the dollar. I still see it going to 125 yen,&quot; said a trader with a Japanese house. The dollar was quoted at 121.45/55 yen in afternoon Tokyo trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Not that many people are willing to buy the Nikkei. Even if it goes above resistance at 18,400, I don't think we'll see the panic buying we saw last week,&quot; said the trader. &quot;I'm still willing to go short.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said investors would want to cash in their gains on any rallies ahead of the Japanese financial year end on March 31.</p>
<p>&quot;If it closes above 18,500, we could see it higher to 18,750 but that looks tough. Hopefully, it'll stay above 18,000,&quot; said a trader with a local institution.</p>
<p>The March MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 315.9 against its opening 316.5 on turnover of 62 lots.</p>
