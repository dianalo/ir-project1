<p>India's central bank loosened its credit policy on Tuesday in a bid to bring down interest rates and keep economic growth on track while containing inflation.</p>
<p>The central bank's measures barely registered in Indian markets, where investors remained focused on the United Front (UF) alliance's efforts to form a new government.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has agreed to step down as leader of the coalition in order to satisfy the Congress party's conditions for supporting another UF-led government.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) moves to boost commercial banks' loanable funds will complement the fallen government's stalled 1997/98 (April-March) budget plan, which will be debated in parliament next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation is around 7.3 percent now,&quot; RBI governor Chakravarty Rangarajan told Reuters Television. &quot;I think we need to take inflation further down. I would be happier with a rate closer to six percent rather than seven percent.&quot; The central bank chief said slower expansion in M3 money supply in 1997/98 should help keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>&quot;I think our 1997/98 monetary target of 15.0-15.5 percent (for M3 expansion) should help us reach our target of lower inflation,&quot; Rangarajan said.</p>
<p>The twin objective of the RBI is to contain inflationary pressures without affecting adequate bank credit to support real gross domestic product growth of 6.0-7.0 percent in 1997/98, he said in a letter to banks spelling out the RBI's credit policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The projected increase in money supply may be reviewed and revised depending upon macro-economic developments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>M3 grew by 15.6 percent in 1996/97 and real GDP (gross domestic product) is expected to have grown by 6.8 percent, the credit policy statement said.</p>
<p>Rangarajan said he expected interest rates to come down as a result of the policy, which also lowered interest rates on bank deposits.</p>
<p>&quot;I think interest rates will come down, because the steps taken in this policy will lead to an increase in the lendable resources of banks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The lowest prime lending rate among India's major banks is 14.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We have also lowered deposit rates which should get reflected in lower lending rates,&quot; Rangarajan said. &quot;The full impact of the reduction in cash reserve ratios made last year will be felt this year. This will also help.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank reduced the ceiling on interest on deposits up to one year by one percentage point to 9.0 percent to give banks more leeway to cut lending rates.</p>
<p>Rangarajan said a number of steps had been taken in the credit policy to improve the credit delivery system.</p>
<p>&quot;We have given greater autonomy to banks to determine working capital limits for borrowers and also eased norms on consortium lending,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rangarajan said the capital market would be boosted by credit policy announcements allowing banks to invest more in shares of companies.</p>
<p>The RBI also said it was removing reserve requirements on inter-bank borrowings. The move is expected to pave the way for the creation of an inter-bank term lending market.</p>
