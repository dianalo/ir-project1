<p>Cuba is making economic changes but will never use &quot;shock therapy&quot; tactics to overhaul its economy, the communist country's central bank governor said in Wednesday's edition of the French newspaper Le Monde.</p>
<p>&quot;We're changing as the world has changed,&quot; Cuban central bank governor Francisco Soberon told Le Monde in an interview. But &quot;we totally reject shock therapies&quot; espoused by such international bodies as the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said Cuba now believed &quot;a certain level of inequality is inevitable as long as it's not too cruel&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the island had been experiencing &quot;a difficult time&quot; since communism collapsed in Europe. This had been aggravated by the &quot;war waged by the United States on all fronts (against Cuba), especially in the area of international finance.&quot;</p>
<p>Unemployment, he said, had reappeared for the first time since the 1959 Cuban communist revolution, touching more than seven percent of the active working population.</p>
<p>He said he was reluctant to talk too much about the country's financial state because of the United States' new anti-Cuban law aimed at curbing foreign investment in Cuba.</p>
<p>But he did say Cuban imports were expected to be slightly above $2.5 billion this year, exports just above $1.5 billion and gross revenues from tourism around $1.3 billion this year. He gave no comparative year-earlier figures.</p>
<p>Cuba had made progress cleaning up its finances, he said, having cut money supply by 25 percent in less than three years.</p>
<p>While the banking community viewed Cuba more favourably than in the past, it still suffered from a financing shortage that hurt its ability to invest in the economy, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no choice but to use short term credit, one-year, at rates above those of the market,&quot; he said. But &quot;bit by bit, we are getting more medium- and long-term credit.&quot;</p>
<p>However, he said the financing Cuba could obtain remained &quot;very insufficent and does not permit us to recapitalize our companies or invest to improve their energy efficiency&quot;.</p>
<p>He added that Cuba had implemented a tougher approach to advancing credit to companies. &quot;We're applying a policy of restrictive credit. Cuban company bosses didn't make any difference between a loan and a grant,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we're carrying out risk analysis and examining accounts.&quot;</p>
<p>He denied this resembled the tight credit policies advocated by the IMF.</p>
<p>&quot;We're doing this out of conviction,&quot; he said. &quot;Our philosophy obliges us to take into account the interests of the people and apply reforms in a gradual manner...We will never adopt the neoliberal model.&quot;</p>
