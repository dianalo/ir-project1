<p>Japan has no specific target for the dollar/yen rate, Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's (MOF) International Finance Bureau, said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;If it is justified by fundamentals, any level (of the dollar/yen rate) is good,&quot; Sakakibara told reporters after attending a meeting of business leaders. The meeting, hosted by publishers of the magazine &quot;Zaikai&quot;, was closed to reporters.</p>
<p>Although various levels have recently been suggested as ideal for the dollar's level against the yen, Sakakibara said Japan has no specific level in mind.</p>
<p>Regarding a comment earlier this week by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer that the G10 nations agree that a strong dollar was in the interests of all, Sakakibara said this comment was favourable for Japan.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara also said the most important Japanese economic indicators for the direction of the dollar's moves against the yen were data on the nation's current account balance and capital flow.</p>
<p>Considering the liberalisation of asset management in Japan, Sakakibara said his ministry supported this process.</p>
<p>&quot;We support this, and in such a freer environment we want to watch what happens,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked what Japan would do if the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates at its next meeting later this month, as widely expected in the financial markets, Sakakibara declined to comment.</p>
