<headline>Annan sees role for international force in Zaire.</headline>

<p>U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said on Monday he believed an international military force could play a role in relieving the humanitarian crisis in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless we can get a ceasefire arranged...maybe we should study the possibility of using troops to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate the refugees,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Annan was speaking at a news conference during a visit to the U.N. war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia in The Hague.</p>
<p>He said he had discussed &quot;the tragic and compelling humanitarian situation&quot; in Zaire with Dutch Foreign Aid Minister Jan Pronk on Monday and would do so again on Tuesday with Prime Minister Wim Kok and Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the compelling situation, I think we need to be creative and try whatever we can to assist. In the meantime, the pressure to get a ceasefire, to get a political solution is going on. I'm not married to one solution or the other, but we need to consider all options,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Several countries had planned to send troops to Zaire late last year but the plan collapsed when many of an estimated 1.2 million refugees from neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi returned home of their own accord.</p>
<p>However, hundreds of thousands of refugees remain trapped in eastern Zaire with little food or water. Many have been caught up in the fighting in eastern Zaire which began in October between Zairean government troops and rebel forces.</p>
<p>There have been eyewitness reports of massacres in eastern Zaire, but international organisations say they are unable to verify them because of the fighting in the area.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency said it had evacuated all foreign aid workers from its headquarters in the eastern Zaire town of Kisangani on Saturday because of growing insecurity caused by the advance of rebel troops.</p>
<p>Rebel chief Laurent Kabila on Sunday dimmed hopes for a ceasefire by rejecting South African and U.S. pressure to sign an agreement to end the war to topple ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>He appealed to the U.N. to help 170,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees who fled Tingi Tingi camp last week in fear of an imminent rebel attack.</p>
