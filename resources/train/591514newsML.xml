<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Friday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida briefed on meetings that took place in Cape Town between the EU and South Africa last week. He said the EU chief negotiator had come back with a positive impression on the negotiations.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said Commissioner de Deus Pinheiro hoped to call a ministerial meeting in June to discuss the state of negotiations.</p>
<p>Asked to react to Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plan to lift the book value of Germany's gold reserves, spokesman Patrick Child said the Commission was pleased to see the determination of the German authorities to do what is necessary to ensure they meet their budgetary objectives.</p>
<p>Child also said he was not aware of any precedent of a member state revaluing its currency and/or gold reserves.</p>
<p>Spokesman Peter Guilford said a written procedure in favour of anti-dumping measures against grey unbleached cotton imports from Asian countries had been launched by the Council on Thursday night and expired at 1600/1400 GMT today. Guilford said the Commission had amended its proposal effectively reducing the time period of the measures from five to one year with a full review at the end of that year.</p>
