<p>A Philippine committee will recommend the withdrawal of illegal entry charges against 21 Chinese fishermen arrested off a disputed rocky outcrop in the South China Sea, a senior official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs undersecretary Rodolfo Severino told reporters the national committee on illegal entrants would ask government prosecutors to withdraw the charges against the Chinese and instead file a case of illegal fishing.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Chinese) were apparently outside Philippine territory,&quot; Severino said, adding the fishermen were only passing through the country's 200-mile exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p>Philippine police have filed charges of illegal entry against the Chinese after they were arrested on May 20 off Scarborough Shoal, a rock formation that Manila said was within its economic zone.</p>
<p>Beijing said the shoal and all other islets, reefs and rocks in the South China historically belong to China.</p>
<p>Under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, foreign vessels can pass through a country's exclusive economic zone provided they do not exploit resources in the area, Severino said.</p>
<p>Severino said the Philippine Navy found tonnes of fish on the Chinese fishermen's boat.</p>
<p>China has protested to the Philippines over the incident, demanding the release of the fishermen.</p>
<p>The arrest of the Chinese fishermen was the third diplomatic row between Manila and Beijing over the outcrop last month.</p>
<p>China earlier protested against the hoisting by Filipinos of their national flag over the rocks. It protested again when a group of Philippine congressmen sailed to the shoal to be photographed standing under the flag.</p>
<p>The shoal lies north of the Spratly Islands, a cluster of potentially oil-rich isles, reefs and atolls that the two countries are also scrapping over. The Spratlys are also claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia.</p>
