<headline>Polyphase faces &quot;going concern&quot; problem.</headline>

<p>Polyphase Corp said on Thursday that its independent auditors have raised &quot;substantial doubts&quot; about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p>The auditor's report announcement accompanied the release of a downward revision by the company of its fiscal 1996 year-end earnings statements and the release of results for the first and second quarters of fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>It said it has revised fiscal 1996 earnings to a loss of $242,000 or $0.03 per share compared with the $1.9 million or $0.13 per share profit it originally reported.  </p>
<p>The company also released its 1997 first quarter and second quarter results Thursday.</p>
<p>Polyphase said it recorded a loss of $67,000 or $0.01 per share on revenues of $36.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1997. It had earned a profit of $797,000 or $0.06 a share in fiscal 1996's first quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it lost $132,000 or $0.01 a share on $38.4 million in revenues for its second quarter ended March 31. Polyphase had reported a profit of $1 million or $0.07 per share a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Earnings in both quarters were hurt by lower gross profit margins in both its food and forestry divisions, it said.</p>
<p>The company's stock has been halted on the American Stock Exchange since February.</p>
<p>Polyphase said it restated fiscal 1996 earnings because an investment firm, PLY Stadium Partners Inc, controlled by Polyphase's chief executive officer Paul Tanner, failed to make payments owed to Polyphase totaling $3.34 million.</p>
<p>As a result, Polyphase said it was required to establish a reserve of $3.34 million against accrued income, which after taxes reduced previously reported net income by $2.2 million.  </p>
<p>The company said it has not yet filed its annual 10-K report for fiscal 1996 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, nor has it filed its 10-Q reports for the first and second quarters of fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>It said the failure to file is due primarily to a dispute with a creditor, Rice Partners II LP, which holds $13 million in subordinated debt from a Polyphase unit, Overhill Farms Inc.</p>
<p>Rice Partners is claiming Polyphase has defaulted on the loan and has filed suit against Polyphase in Dallas District Court, Polyphase said.  </p>
<p>Polyphase said that it has been on time with its payments and said it has filed a countersuit alleging Rice conspired with a former Overhill officer to attempt to force Polyphase to sell Overhill at a distressed price.</p>
<p>The company said the dispute with Rice and the failure to file its 10-K and 10-Q forms has resulted in other, non-monetary technical defaults with other lenders.</p>
<p>As a result, substantially all of Polyphase's $31 million in long-term debt has been classified as a current liability on the company's financial statements, it said.</p>
<p>It is the combination of these conditions that led Polyphase's independent auditors to raise the &quot;substantial&quot; doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, Polyphase said.</p>
<p>Polyphase said it intends to file the 10-K and 10-Q reports within days. It said it then expects trading in its stock to resume.</p>
<p>Polyphase also said it is negotiating a transaction involving its Overhill Farms unit. The company said it hopes such a transactioni will resolve the Rice situation.</p>
