<title>USA: CME live, feeder cattle end lower after new highs.</title>
<headline>CME live, feeder cattle end lower after new highs.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Early posting of contract highs in deferred CME live cattle futures and all months of feeder cattle gave way to profit taking and sell stops, knocking futures lower to sharply lower by the close, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.925 to 0.325 cent per lb lower with February off 0.925 at 63.825 cents and April off 0.925 at 65.900 cents. October through distant February posted new contract highs early. Feeder cattle ended 0.700 lower to unchanged with March off most at 68.975 cents. All months posted new contract highs early with March setting a new high of 70.450 and April a new high of 70.650 cents.</p>
<p>Nearby live cattle futures were weighed down by disappointment that packers held bids down despite a modest rebound in beef prices on Friday. Slow cash beef sales early Monday added to the bearish sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>Friday's Cattle Inventory report, although bullish to distant live cattle and most feeder cattle contracts was neutral at best to nearby live cattle, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The report told you that there are plenty of cattle for the front months and those front months (of futures) coming off influenced everything else,&quot; said Dave Maher with Securties Corporation of Iowa.  </p>
<p>Chartists added that the market looked technically weak after meeting chart resistance early then tumbling.</p>
<p>Some of the early buyers turned sellers on the break with Refco and R.J. O'Brien notable sellers. In live cattle options, commission houses sold February 65 calls and June 68 and 70 calls. There was light liquidation of February 64 puts, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Profit taking accounted for the sharp reversal in feeder cattle after new highs were set early. Futures hit sell stops on the setback after touching buy stops early as futures shot to new highs, traders said.</p>
<p>The USDA inventory report was bullish for feeder cattle as it showed feeder cattle weighing less than 500 lbs on January 1 down four percent percent from a year earlier. The number was under pre-report expectations. But many traders considered the report already in the market after advances last week, and cattle futures deflated on Monday.</p>
<p>LFG, Smith Barney, Refco, E.D.&amp;F. Man and Cargill Investor Services sold on the setback, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Further technical weakness was expected Tuesday as futures showed a major technical reversal after recording a month-long rally, chartists said.</p>
