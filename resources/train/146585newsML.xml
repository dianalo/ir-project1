<p>The South African government would adopt a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; approach to ensuring greater racial and gender equity in the workplace, the parliamentary labour committee heard on Monday.</p>
<p>Labour director-general Sipho Pityana and labour relations chief director Jeremy Baskin told the committee that there would be both incentives and sanctions to encourage companies to appoint or promote more black people.</p>
<p>&quot;It is envisaged that there will be a possibility of fines against people who are consistently violating the provisions of the envisaged legislation,&quot; Pityana said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is also consideration that we will use the tender regulations to take a harsh position against people who violate the regulations.&quot;</p>
<p>But he hoped that it would be generally accepted that discrimination of any kind was wrong so that government would rather rely on incentives and encouragement.</p>
<p>Baskin said the policy document on promoting employment and occupational equity released in July had received a mixed response.</p>
<p>&quot;(But it is) more and more widely accepted that it is a correct goal that over time the workforce should look like the nation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Employers had welcomed the fact that government was not thinking of introducing employment quotas, but instead expected them to set clear targets that would be closely monitored.</p>
<p>&quot;There was widepspread acceptance that codes of good practice have to be developed about grading systems, hiring procedures and promotion,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Baskin said that only large employers would be monitored.</p>
<p>Pityana said that his department's next task would be to draft a bill, which would be presented to parliament next year. He did not expect the new legislation to be implemented until 1998.</p>
