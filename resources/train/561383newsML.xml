<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Monday discussed Middle East peace talks, which have been suspended over Israel's construction of Jewish settlements on occupied land.</p>
<p>Arafat consults Mubarak often on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, broken off after Israel started a Jewish settlement on a site in Arab East Jerusalem called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.</p>
<p>&quot;The Judaisation of Quds (Jerusalem) is a dangerous crime as well as continued action to confiscate land and build settlements, especially Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; Arafat told reporters late on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the basic issue between us and them, in addition to lack of accurate and honest implementation of what has been agreed upon, whether it be the first, second or third peace agreements signed in Washington or Cairo.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel regards East Jerusalem -- captured in 1967 -- as part of its indivisible capital, Palestinians view it as the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>EU envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos was also in Cairo and Arafat is to meet Israeli President Ezer Weizman on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, due in Israel on Tuesday in an effort to restart the talks, had new ideas to break the stalemate, Arafat said: &quot;I don't think so.&quot; But he added: &quot;All of our options are open.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The problems which we face and which obstruct the peace process are from the Israeli side, foremost of which are the settlements, especially Jabal Abu Ghneim, as well as not implementing the agreements,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Palestinian minister Nabil Shaath, who accompanied Arafat, said in Cairo on Sunday there was a crisis of trust over cooperating with Israel on security.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said they suspect Israeli secret services of operating in self-rule areas and Shaath was asked about a Palestinian who said he was recruited by Israel to incite Moslem militants to carry out two suicide attacks which killed the bombers.</p>
<p>Israel called the allegation &quot;a ridiculous lie,&quot; but Shaath told Reuters television: &quot;This is a very serious matter. We have revealed full information that the two so-called operations...were actually conducted by the Israeli Shin Bet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This I think sheds a great light on the whole campaign of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu to paint the Palestinians as organising terror, giving a green light to terror. Terror was actually fabricated by the Israelis,&quot; he said.</p>
