<title>USA: NBA BASKETBALL-CELTICS-SIXERS DEAL MAY BE VOIDED IF RADJA FAILS TO REPORT.</title>
<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-CELTICS-SIXERS DEAL MAY BE VOIDED IF RADJA FAILS TO REPORT.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>Last Friday's trade between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia was on hold Monday because Dino Radja had yet to report to the 76ers for a mandatory physical.</p>
<p>The Celtics sent forward Radja to Philadelphia for forwards Clarence Weatherspoon and Michael Cage. But if the Croat does not report to Philadelphia by 5 p.m. (2100 gmt) Tuesday, then the Sixers will likely void the trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade situation right now is in a little bit of disarray,&quot; said Celtics new coach Rick Pitino at a Monday news conference which was scheduled to discuss the team's plans for Wednesday's NBA Draft.</p>
<p>&quot;Philadelphia will void the deal in our estimation if he does not show up (for his physical) and we'll have to react to him not showing up.&quot;</p>
<p>The 6-11 (2.10 m) Radja has three years left on his current contract worth $15 million. He was limited to just 25 games last season due to a knee injury, but averaged 14 points and 8.4 rebounds for the Celtics, who finished with a franchise-worst 15-67 record.</p>
<p>Radja was a 1989 second-round draft pick by Boston, but remained in Europe until 1993, when he earned NBA All-Rookie second-team honours by averaging 15.1 points and 7.2 rebounds in 80 games. Radja enjoyed his best season in 1995-96 when he averaged 19.7 points and 9.8 boards in 53 contests.</p>
<p>Weatherspoon started all 82 games for the 76ers last year, averaging a career-low 12.2 points with 8.3 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>If the trade goes through, 35-year-old journeyman Cage will join his fifth NBA team. He averaged just 1.8 points and 3.9 rebounds last season and has played in 657 consecutive games -- the second longest active streak in the NBA.</p>
<p>Philadelphia, which finished at 22-60 last season, also has a new head coach, having replaced Johnny Davis with Larry Brown. The 76ers have the second overall selection in Wednesday's draft, plus three second-round picks.</p>
<p>Boston has the third and sixth overall selections in Wednesday's draft.</p>
