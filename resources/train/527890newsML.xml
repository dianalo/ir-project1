<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Wednesday he regretted he was not informed of Peru's storming of the residence of the Japanese ambassador to end a long siege but said no one could criticise the move.</p>
<p>&quot;We unfortunately were not told of the operation before the move. I regret this, but we thank the Peruvian authorities for seizing the chance,&quot; Hashimoto told a news conference.</p>
<p>Japan has persistently demanded a peaceful end to the hostage drama, but maintained that they would stand by the Peruvian government.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said all 24 Japanese hostages, including Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki, were rescued soon after Peruvian troops stormed his residence after a four-month ordeal.</p>
<p>&quot;We were truly hoping for a peaceful solution, but that is a notion of someone who is far away at a place where there is a 14-hour time difference,&quot; Hashimoto said.</p>
<p>&quot;How can any one criticise President (Alberto) Fujimori? It is not important whether we had prior knowledge of the move. The important thing is that the hostages were freed.&quot;</p>
<p>Hashimoto said he will send Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda to Lima as soon as possible to consult with Peruvian authorities.</p>
<p>He said was awakened by aides minutes after the first shots were fired by Peruvian troops storming the residence, which started at around 5.23 a.m. Japan time (2023 GMT).</p>
<p>All Japanese television stations covered the event live from Lima.</p>
<p>Hashimoto also offered condolences over the deaths of some Peruvian troops in the operation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not confirmed this, but it appears some of the soldiers died. We offer our deepest thanks and condolences.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Hashimoto received a letter from top mediator Roman Catholic Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani urging the Japanese government to press for a peaceful end to the crisis.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's aides said Cipriani's plea was based on concerns that hardliners in Fujimori's government had put pressure on the Peruvian government to storm the residence.</p>
