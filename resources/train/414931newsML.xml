<p>Regulators Monday approved long-delayed plans to auction two airwave licenses to create new nationwide radio services that will be beamed coast-to-coast via satellite and offer CD-quality reception.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission, in resolving a long-standing dispute among its four comissioners, said it will limit the April 1 sale to the four companies that had applied by the end of 1992 to offer digital audio radio -- instead of opening the auction to any company.</p>
<p>The four are: CD Radio Inc. of Washington, D.C.; American Mobile Radio Corp., a unit of American Mobile Satellite Corp. of Reston, Va.; Digital Broadcast Satellite Corp. of Seattle; and Primosphere LP of New York.</p>
<p>To receive the new service, listeners will have to buy a special radio receiver that will cost about $200, in addition to the price of a regular radio, according to industry estimates.</p>
<p>It is likely the new service will be subscription-based, with an expected cost of about $10 a month. Operators will be able to offer specialised programming.</p>
<p>CD Radio, which pioneered the digital radio concept, plans to provide 30 channels of commercial-free music programming if it wins one of the two licenses up for grabs.</p>
<p>The company would target persons who drive a lot or live in rural areas and do not have access to many radio stations.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Reed Hundt and Commissioner Susan Ness had favoured opening the auction of the licenses to any bidders, instead of limiting it to the four.</p>
<p>But they were unable to get the other two commissioners at the FCC -- Rachelle Chong and James Quello -- to agree.</p>
<p>&quot;I would prefer to assign spectrum licenses through an auction open to all. Closing the auction is the wrong result,&quot; Hundt said in a statement.</p>
<p>An open auction could have raised a larger sum for the government by attracting more deep-pocketed bidders.</p>
<p>Hundt noted recently that MCI Communications Corp. last year paid $683 million to win the last remaining satellite slot to beam television programmes nationwide.</p>
<p>The commissioners, in resolving another dispute, agreed to require the license winners to offer discounted advertising rates and equal time to political candidates running for federal office.</p>
<p>The agency also told the applicants that the winners could be subject to other public-interest obligations in the future.</p>
<p>The FCC is ready to unveil plans to auction a separate valuable airwave slice that will be home to a wireless technology that could offer new competition to local phone companies and cable-television operators.</p>
<p>A government official said the FCC plans to announce soon its long-awaited auction plans for local multipoint distribution service, or LMDS, a wireless technology that allows users to zap voice, pictures and data over high-speed networks that also can hook up to the Internet.</p>
<p>&quot;All the issues have been resolved,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>The FCC is expected to bar local carriers and cable firms from bidding for LMDS licenses in their home territories in a bid to bar them from snuffing out potential competition.</p>
