<p>Belgian coach Georges Leekens said on Friday he was brimming with confidence ahead of Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Wales because he had no other choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, I have a new-look team, with inexperienced players. If I start having doubts, it would leave a bad impression,&quot; said Leekens, who has plenty of reasons to be nervous after being forced to change his line-up three times.</p>
<p>PSV Eindhoven striker Luc Nilis, Newcastle defender Philippe Albert and Anderlecht defender Olivier Doll have all pulled out with injuries and Belgium's veteran 1996 player of the year Franky Van der Elst is doubtful with a groin injury.</p>
<p>Leekens announced his team early this week and said there was no use in playing hide-and-seek against the Welsh.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you really think that someone in Wales cares whether (Bertrand) Crasson or Doll are in the team?&quot; he said. &quot;British teams never adjust to their opponents.&quot;</p>
<p>Van der Elst, capped 70 times, said Belgium were just as strong as Wales. He said Ryan Giggs was the only Welsh player with more talent than the Belgians.</p>
<p>Van der Elst said he was unconcerned at the prospect of facing Chelsea's bustling striker Mark Hughes.</p>
<p>&quot;I've already played four times against Hughes and he scored just once. He doesn't frighten me,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Belgium must avoid defeat if they are to stay in the running in European qualifying group seven. They are currently third, behind the Netherlands and Wales.</p>
<p>Team:</p>
<p>Filip De Wilde, Bertrand Crasson, Bart De Roover, Eric Van Meir, Rudi Smidts, Dominique Lemoine, Lorenzo Staelens, Franky Van der Elst, Nico Van Kerckhoven, Lokonda Mpenza, Luis Oliveira</p>
