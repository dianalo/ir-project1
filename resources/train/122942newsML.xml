<p>Some traders were not impressed by the figures while others said they were about in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil cif Europe closed $5 down after Oct traded at $530 and $527.50 during the afternoon. Refined palm oil was $2.50 to $7.50 lower with no further business reported.</p>
<p>Coconut oil closed $5 to $2.50 lower in a tradeless market while palemkernel oil was unchanged after Nov/Dec traded at $687.50 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Among soft oils Dutch soy oil closed 1.50 to two guilders down after Feb/Apr traded at 92 and May/Jul at 93 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Dutch/EU rape oil finished 0.50 guilders lower in a tradeless markets.</p>
