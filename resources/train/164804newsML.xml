<p>Switzerland's best chance of dampening any potential Swiss franc surge against the Euro single currency lies in continuing the Swiss National Bank's autonomous monetary policy, a government study said.</p>
<p>The study, commissioned by the Economics Ministry, supported the SNB's views on how to react if doubts on financial markets about the European Union's planned single currency cause the strong Swiss franc to rise further.</p>
<p>The study said pegging the Swiss franc exchange rate to the Euro should only be considered as a temporary measure in case the Swiss currency makes extreme and continuous gains.  </p>
<p>&quot;Considering that Switzerland would lose its advantageous (lower) real interest rates by changing to a fixed exchange rate, the working group believes it remains in Switzerland's interests to maintain an autonomous monetary policy,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said the SNB should continue to balance between a tighter anti-inflation policy of keeping money supply in a medium-term target range and a more liberal policy during times when the Swiss franc draws strong investor attention.</p>
<p>The panel of business, financial and labour experts and economists was asked by Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz last February to look at scenarios for the run-up to the Euro's debut in 1999 and recommend action against a Swiss franc surge.</p>
<p>Four scenarios were examined, from a calm launch of the Euro on schedule with just a few stable member countries to a stormy start if the 1999 deadline is delayed or if strict monetray criteria are eased to allow more EU countries to join.</p>
<p>The study said relatively mild and shorter term increases in the Swiss franc against the Euro and other European currencies could be countered by a flexible approach from the SNB.</p>
<p>It said the only severe risk lay in any extreme crisis of confidence on financial markets in the Euro, which would likely result in a flood of investments into hard currencies including the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>&quot;If monetary union develops with an economic policy that is not stability oriented and if the price stability of the single currency is therefore seriously endangered, then Switzerland cannot fully isolate itself from the results of this policy,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;But with the exception of this extreme development, which is considered a low probability, it is possible to dampen external influences with an autonomous monetary policy,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Its findings largely backed the most recent SNB stance voiced in an October 22 speech by central bank vice-chairman Jean-Pierre Roth.</p>
<p>Roth at the time said monetary policy was the SNB's preferred tool for offsetting possible Swiss franc gains against the Euro, rather than pegging the Swiss currency to the Euro or imposing restrictions on capital flows into Swizterland.</p>
