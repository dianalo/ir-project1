<p>It was still raining in parts of the far east of England on Friday morning, after a night of showers in the agricultural areas of East Anglia, a spokesman for the London Weather Centre said.</p>
<p>The last of the showers has still to clear the eastern coast, he said.</p>
<p>The amount of rainfall remains a vital issue for the region, suffering from a prolonged dry spell. Although recent rains have been enough to ease farmers' immediate concerns over soil moisture, they have not been anything like enough to dispel water industry worries over supplies for domestic and irrigation use.</p>
<p>For the period until 0600 GMT Friday morning, the area got up to 10 millimetres of rain, reported on the north Norfolk coast, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>There were sunny periods in between the showers, a pattern which the Meteorological Office expected to continue today.</p>
<p>Showery weather will probably last through the coming weekend in much of western Europe, independent forecaster Weather Services Corp said on Friday.</p>
<p>Showers early in the period in eastern Europe will give way to drying and warming. Similar conditions are expected in the western former Soviet Union as it warms up over the weekend into next week.</p>
