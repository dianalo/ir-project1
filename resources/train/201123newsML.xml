<p>The New Zealand dollar closed firmer on Tuesday despite weak earnings data suggesting the economy remains on track for an easing of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was strong buying interest out of Tokyo, presumed to be linked to another impending dual currency samurai issue. The Kiwi closed at US$0.7114/21 and 67.21 on its Trade-Weighted Index from 0.7087/94 and 67.09 at the open.</p>
<p>That was in spite of data showing private sector wages rose just 3.7 percent for the year against expectations of a 4.2 percent rise. Total ordinary time earnings were up 3.4 percent, in line with forecasts.  </p>
<p>Economists said the data, along with other recent releases, showed the labour market was ceasing to be an inflation concern for the Reserve Bank. Some said worries about looser fiscal policy under a new government were now the only stumbling block to an easing of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The local market tried to sell it (the Kiwi) down on that, but it just ran into the same old interest. It's still not the local market that's controlling this kiwi at the moment, it's the continued samurai appetite,&quot; a Wellington dealer said.</p>
<p>He said a local bank tried to sell after the data but ran into a &quot;wall of buyers&quot;.  </p>
<p>An Auckland dealer said New Zealand interest rates, even once an easing eventuates, may still be attractive in relative terms. &quot;There's talk of samurai interest again, talk of more euros, so it still looks reasonably attractive.&quot;</p>
<p>He saw support around the figure overnight, with a cap around 0.7125/30.</p>
<p>There was no impact from a resumption of coalition negotiations between nationalist New Zealand First and the National and Labour parties, which have dragged on for more than a month. NZ First leader Winston Peters said he hoped to conclude the talks &quot;in the next few weeks&quot;.  </p>
