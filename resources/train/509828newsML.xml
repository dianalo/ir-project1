<p>Mobil Corp. aims to increase its operating earnings to $5 billion a year by the turn of the century from $3.2 billion in 1996, based on flat oil prices, its chief executive said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lucio Noto told industry analysts that the oil company also hopes to grow its earnings per share by 10 percent a year through the year 2001 and wants to almost double its share price by then.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, investors pushed Mobil's stock up $2.375 to $123.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The share price target is $200 by 2001, equivalent to $100 after the company undertakes a two-for-one stock split later this year, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't make any promises, but over the next five years, we would like to grow our dividend to shareholders at least as fast as the average of 5 percent per year it grew over the last five years, which would keep our shareholders ahead of inflation,&quot; Noto said.</p>
<p>He said that if Mobil's debt to equity ratio fell much below the target level of 30 percent, the Fairfax, Va.-based company would buy back stock or increase its dividend payout.</p>
<p>&quot;Earnings improvement will be driven by internal initiatives such as volume growth, expense reduction and better performance in all of its businesses,&quot; Noto said.</p>
<p>Much of the growth will come from exploration and production and international operations as more of the company's $5 billion to $6 billion annual capital spending is targeted at production operations and volumes grow by 3.5 percent a year.</p>
<p>The company also believes that it can turn around its troubled refining and marketing sector, which it said will be aided by 4 percent to 5 percent annual sales growth from fuels and lubricants.</p>
