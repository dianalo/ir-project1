<p>The Chinese yuan closed unchanged at 8.2960 on Friday from Thursday's close against the U.S. dollar with its upward trend of the past two days curtailed by central bank intervention, dealers said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Thursday was 8.2959.</p>
<p>The yuan opened higher at 8.2956 and moved steadily between 8.2955 and 8.2960 for most of the session, hitting an intraday high of 8.2908 and a low of 8.2964.</p>
<p>Trading was active with most done at about 8.2956, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the yuan moved strongly for most of the session, supported by fresh buying at about 8.2960. The People's Bank of China was seen capping the yuan late in the trading.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculative buying pushed the yuan to an intraday high of 8.2908, which also helped strengthen pro-yuan sentiment,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expect the yuan to consolidate around 8.2960 early next week.</p>
<p>The yuan ended up at 6.7101 from 6.7360 against 100 Japanese yen and little changed at 1.0711 from 1.0710 against the Hong Kong dollar. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004</p>
