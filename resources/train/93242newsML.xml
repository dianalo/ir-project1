<title>UK: Forties, Oseberg crude benefit from gas oil rally.</title>
<headline>Forties, Oseberg crude benefit from gas oil rally.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea crude markets were buoyed up by extremely strong refining margins, particularly for gas oil-rich grades like Oseberg and Forties, and sentiment remained strong on Thursday despite a fall-off in activity after Wednesday's frantic exchanges.</p>
<p>Six million barrels of North Sea crude changed hands at mostly strenthening premiums on Wednesday, but a cargo of sour Flotta sold on Thursday at Dated Brent -57.5 cents, with late pricing equivalent to -60 cents, confirming the slack interest in the crude.</p>
<p>November Brent gained around 30 cents to $23.42 per barrel.  </p>
<p>A Brent cargo loading on October 16-18 was sold at November Brent +13 cents, 11 cents over Wednesday's highest trade.</p>
<p>The buyer, which already held six cargoes, was short a cargo for a VLCC loading around October 15, possibly destined for South Africa, traders said. Its two other cargoes, loading around October 8, were probably destined for the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;With heating oil making new highs in New York, its enough to bring warmth to refiners' hearts,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>He said there were still some end-month loadings of most North Sea crudes available, but Forties and Oseberg were both in short supply.  </p>
<p>&quot;Ekofisk is struggling a bit because of its high gasoline content,&quot; a refiner said.</p>
<p>Mediterranean sour crudes tumbled in line with Flotta in the North and with the sharp acceleration for sweet, traders said.</p>
<p>A Urals cargo changed hands at Dated Brent -70 cents cif Augusta on Wednesday, 10 cents below the last done, and dealers reported plenty more available.</p>
<p>A shipping inspector reported about 1.4 million tonnes due to load from the Black Sea by the end of next week.</p>
<p>&quot;There's plenty there for whoever wants some. I think the next deal will have a seven in front of it,&quot; a trader said.</p>
