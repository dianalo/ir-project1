<p>French bond futures took a breather after two day's of gains driven by short covering and slipped with Bunds as a dispute about revaluing gold reserves continued and as investors began to fear the negative impact of potential French Socialist policies on the budget deficit.</p>
<p>French bond futures received some respite during the GLOBEX session as Bunds climbed on a leaked report that German unemployment, one of the factors causing the 1997 German deficit to overshoot forecasts, fell in May, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they were awaiting the naming of the new Socialist government but didn't think it would have much impact.  </p>
<p>Traders also said investors, notably domestic holders of bonds, were starting to hedge their positions with options in case the new Socialist programme, due to be unveiled later this month, was badly received.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestics are nervous, they're not captive buyers but the last thing they will do is sell something. They've already got too much cash,&quot; an analyst at a French bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Dips will be countered by buying to pick off opportunites but there's no confidence behind their buying interest. Domestic investors are not at all comfortable with the situation,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the main interest in the naming of the new government was to look for confirmation that the Communists would not hold any significant market sensitive posts.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac was due to hold a second meeting with prime minister Lionel Jospin to discuss the new cabinet appointments at 1700 GMT.</p>
<p>Another analyst at a French bank said there was also some speculation a meeting of European Social democrats in Sweden, which Jospin will attend, could be used to form a platform to launch a challenge to the stability pact. Jospin said during the campaign he did not want to ratify the pact agreed last year.  </p>
<p>Analysts said if Chirac were to approve the pact at a summit in Amsterdam on June 16 and 17 it would cause tension with Jospin, as he would be reneging on a campaign pledge, and if Chirac backtracked it would cause tension with Germany.</p>
<p>Although the ratification of the pact could calm fears of a soft single currency among hard core bond markets, such as France, the risk of serious tension within Europe was potentially negative for French bonds, they said.</p>
<p>The 10-year spread between French and German bond yields narrowed to minus eight basis points late on Wednesday from minus 13 on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market ramifications could be quite deep if the stability pact were not ratified at Amsterdam...we could see spread widening and speculation about EMU delays,&quot; Iain Lindsay, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. &quot;Six months ahead they would probably cobble some solution together but in short term could be doubts about monetary union.&quot;</p>
<p>The June bond future settled down 0.26 at 129.14. One trader said the next support would be at 128.98/129 and then 128.78/80. On the upside he said 129.66/68 would provide major resistance.  </p>
<p>June PIBOR ended down two basis points at 96.50. Traders said those taking profits after this week's rally was offsetting buying by those trying to close short positions.</p>
<p>The French franc was relatively stable against the mark but suffered against the dollar amid concerns a future European single currency would be weakened by the inclusion of a wide number of countries or a relaxation of the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>The franc fell as low as 5.8568, within a whisker of the April low of 8.8580, which was its lowest level since April 1994. It has fallen 12.9 percent so far this year.</p>
