<p>Talks between Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana on Monday were useful but differences remained on many questions, a foreign ministry statement said.</p>
<p>The statement, carried by Interfax news agency, said a timetable had been worked out for talks to continue but added that they would not be easy.  </p>
<p>&quot;The meeting was useful although, of course, there are different approaches on a range of questions,&quot; the statement said after five hours of talks on NATO's plans to expand eastwards and create a new relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;Discussions will be continued. A timetable has been set for future work. It is clear that it will not be easy but the two sides will try to make them a success.&quot;</p>
<p>Solana left Moscow after a 24-hour visit without talking to reporters about the meeting with Primakov outside Moscow. But NATO headquarters in Brussels issued a statement similar to the Russian one.</p>
<p>Russia opposes NATO's plans to take in new members from eastern and central Europe. Solana had tried to reassure Moscow that expansion would not threaten its security or create new divisions in Europe.</p>
