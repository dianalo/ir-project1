<p>Right-wing Conservatives on Wednesday heaped praise on Britain's Foreign Secretary for delivering a warning that a single currency could split the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;I say three cheers for Malcolm Rifkind for beginning to set out our stall,&quot; John Redwood, one of the leaders of the party's so-called Eurosceptic wing, said.</p>
<p>In a speech in Zurich earlier, Rifkind said if the planned single currency went ahead, the EU would be divided into two groups of members for the foreseeable future, since about half the existing members would not qualify to join in.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not proceed down a path of integration faster or further than our people are prepared to go,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sensing that Rifkind's words marked a move towards his wing of the party, Redwood told Channel 4 television: &quot;It is a very welcome speech.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the foreign secretary has looked at the damage this scheme is now doing and has looked at the strong opinion in the Conservative Party, which is that we want a common market and not a common government.&quot;</p>
<p>Redwood last year resigned from Prime Minister John Major's government to challenge him for the leadership of the Conservative Party, with a call for tougher opposition to European integration a theme of his campaign.</p>
<p>But he said that following Rifkind's speech, &quot;I live in hope that we will have a very good (election) manifesto on this subject.&quot;</p>
<p>A general election must be called in Britain by next May. The opposition Labour Party is currently the favourite to win, with a 20 point lead in the opinion polls, helped by divisions within the Conservatives over Europe.</p>
<p>Major, in an attempt to hold his party together, has said he will decide whether to join a single currency when full details of how it would operate are clear -- after the next election.</p>
<p>He has also pledged a referendum on the issue.</p>
