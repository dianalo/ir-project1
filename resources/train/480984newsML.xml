<p>North Sea crudes remained in the doldrums on Wednesday and few traders or refiners expected differentials to show much of an improvement in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Physical trade was more active with two mid-April Osebergs trading at firmer dated -32 cents and dated -28 cents. An April 29-31 Ekofisk moved at a steady dated Brent -3 cents while Statfjord traded at a premium of seven cents to dated Brent.</p>
<p>&quot;But the problem is there is far too much crude around. Even with refining margins improving and refiners running as much as they can it just doesn't take enough crude out. Buy tomorrow, don't buy today is my motto,&quot; a trader at a major said.</p>
<p>The trader reckoned that even with some U.S. refiners coming out of turnaround the world crude supply/demand balance was still long almost two million barrels per day.</p>
<p>&quot;I just see the whole overhang shifting forward day by day,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>May Brent on the IPE had lost some 41 cents by 1800 GMT to trade at $18.69 a barrel. The most actively traded intermonth spread was the May/June which moved from early deals at -18 cents to recent trade at -21 cents.</p>
<p>Both Brent April 17-19 cargoes in today's chains were again kept by BP. Talk of a sale of an April 9-11 cargo could not be immediately confirmed.</p>
<p>The CFD market also took a tumble with the April 7-11 week recently trading at May -70 cents. April 14-18 lost ground to talk around June -75/-70 cents.</p>
