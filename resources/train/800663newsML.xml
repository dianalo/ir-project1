<title>GERMANY: Bunds higher again as Treasuries support.</title>
<headline>Bunds higher again as Treasuries support.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bund futures continued their yo-yo trading of this week, climbing solidly into positive territory on Thursday and maybe setting the stage for further gains on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Bunds took comfort on the day from a stronger Treasury market and the belief that inflation here is a long way off even if it does appear that the Bundesbank may be pondering tightening monetary policy.</p>
<p>The DTB Bund future contract was up 21 basis points at 102.17 at 1410 GMT after having traded in a range between 102.08 and 102.26.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is showing a good bit of stability at higher levels today,&quot; said Hans Nordstrom, trader at BMP Wertpapiere und Optionen GmbH. &quot;If we close at these levels, the market could go higher on Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>Gains, however, are so far coming largely on the long-end of the yield curve with short-dated maturities hurt by continuing nervousness about a possible increase in German interest rates.</p>
<p>Indeed, the spread between two-and 10-year maturities narrowed by four basis points by late in the day to 178 basis points.  </p>
<p>The short-end of the curve could be especially vulnerable to the dollar. One trader said a rebound in the U.S. currency would once again raise speculation of a rate increase which would be felt the most in short dated maturities.</p>
<p>He said that with little threat of inflation, the long end of the curve could even benefit from a tightening of German monetary policy as a sign that the Bundesbank is determined to keep prices under control.</p>
<p>Nordstom said that given a stable Treasury market, he could see the futures contract moving towards 102.50, but expected profit-takers to slow any advance beyond that point.  </p>
<p>The benchmark Bund was also higher, trading at 102.37 compared with 102.25 on Wednesday to yield 5.67 percent.</p>
<p>The never-ending tug of war between those who see a prompt start to monetary union and those seeking a delay went to the sceptics on Thursday with a pair of negative EMU comments.</p>
<p>Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber continued campaigning for a delay in the launch of EMU, telling a French newspaper &quot;If France or Germany do not respect the criteria to the letter we will find another alternative.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher, meanwhile, said the next offical tax revenue estimate for 1997 due in November may show an additional shortfall of 10 billion marks compared with last estimate in May.</p>
<p>The remarks did not have much impact on market prices, however.</p>
<p>Treasuries continued to outperform Bunds on the day, driving the spread to 72 basis points from 78 basis points at the prior close.</p>
