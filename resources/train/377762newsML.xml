<p>A consortium of five Polish banks agreed to lend the state PKP railways 633 million zlotys to buy 50 locomotives from Poland's Pafawag, clearing the take-over of Pafawag by Adtranz, the bank consortium leader said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we signed an agreement creating a loan consortium for 10 years and two agreements with Polish State Railways (PKP) for the purchase of 50 locomotives in Pafawag for a total of 633 million zlotys,&quot; said Krzysztof Szwarc, president of Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA (BRE), the bank leading the consortium.</p>
<p>He said the loan would consist of two tranches -- one for 285 million zlotys and the second for 165 million Swiss francs.</p>
<p>There are no government guarantees for the loans which have their interest based on one-month WIBOR for the zloty tranche and on one-month LIBOR for the currency tranche. </p>
<p>The five banks creating the consortium are: BRE, the Polish Development Bank (PBR), Pekao SA bank, Bank Handlowy SA and Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA (PBK).</p>
<p>Szwarc said the loan for PKP cleared the way for the completion of the sale of 75 percent of Pafawag to Adtranz for for $3.7 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, thanks to the PKP order...the sale of Pafawag to Adtranz can be finalised,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In September Poland signed an initial agreement with Adtranz, a joint venture of ABB group and Daimler-Benz AG, to sell it the ailing rolling-stock maker Pafawag SA.  </p>
<p>Adtranz agreed to bring modern technology to Pafawag and invest $28.1 million there over the next six years on the condition that the firm gets a locomotive delivery order from the Polish State Railways (PKP).</p>
<p>Adtranz would then increase Pafawag's capital by $6 million and launch the production of a high-speed state-of-the-art locomotive. Pafawag, which employes 1,620 people, is based in the south-western city of Wroclaw.</p>
<p>Head of Daimler Benz Transportation for Central Europe John Kapala, aslo present, said that formalities of Adtranz's takeover of Pafawag should be completed by the end of February.  </p>
<p>PKP's director general Jan Janik said PKP welcomed the conditions of the contract. &quot;This is the best contract we could get,&quot; he said, adding it was collateralised by PKP's locomotives, liquid assets and real estate.</p>
<p>PKP had a 71 million zloty net loss in 1995 and preliminary data showed 1996 results were worse, but Janik said the company expected to break even this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our financial situation is good, the overall debt is not higher than 50 percent allowed by the World Bank,&quot; Janik said.</p>
