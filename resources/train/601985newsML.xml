<title>USA: Some McDonald's franchisees seek new US law.</title>

<p>A group of McDonald's Corp restaurant operators on Wednesday threw their support behind the American Franchisee Association's attempts to have the U.S. Congress pass a franchisee rights bill.</p>
<p>&quot;We're turning to the law now,&quot; said Gerardo Perez, a McDonald's franchisee in Cameron Park, Calif.</p>
<p>Perez was among about a half-dozen former and current McDonald's franchisees at a news conference here who aired complaints about the Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast-food giant.  </p>
<p>The most common problem mentioned by the franchisees is the alleged impact on existing restaurants from new outlets being opened.</p>
<p>Florida franchisee Joe Davis, who operates four units, complained that new McDonald's restaurants are &quot;encroaching&quot; on the sales of existing eateries.</p>
<p>Susan Kezios, president of the Chicago-based franchisee association, said her group was trying for a third year to have legislation enacted that would protect operators' rights in contracts with their franchisors.  </p>
<p>Kezios said her group was working with Congressman Gary Ackerman, a New York Democrat, who has introduced a bill into the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a property rights issue,&quot; Kezios said of the franchisee legislation.</p>
<p>McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said the company and its &quot;mainstream&quot; franchisees continue to oppose franchisee legislation, which he said impedes their freedom to do business.</p>
<p>&quot;Of our franchisees, the mainstream generally take the position that more government regulations are not good for small businesses,&quot; Ebeling said. &quot;That's why we continue to work with the franchisees in their efforts to defeat, repeal or modify legislation that will hurt their business and the value of their business.&quot;</p>
<p>Ebeling added that there are six independent franchisee associations within McDonald's that meet with the company on a regular basis to discuss operator concerns.</p>
