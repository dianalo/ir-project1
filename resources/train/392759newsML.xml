<p>Dozens of U.S. poultry companies have sent letters to the U.S. Agriculture Department opposing a proposed meat and poultry export sales report, according to a survey of the comments carried out by Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In November, USDA asked for comments on ways to report meat and poultry export sales. The proposal was spurred by the recommendations of a USDA task force on concentration in the livestock markets and is aimed at increasing market information.  </p>
<p>In their comments, poultry firms argued that because their industry is vertically integrated, and because growers at the farm level bear little market risk, those producers would get no real benefit from the report. They also said detailed reporting on export transactions would stifle competition at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see no benefit to be derived from such a requirement, only further intrusion into a system that already works quite well,&quot; the USA Poultry &amp; Egg Export Council said in a letter dated Feb. 11.  </p>
<p>While poultry firms asked to be excluded from any new export reporting requirements, meat and pork groups backed the idea. The National Pork Producers Council said pork producers needed access to more detailed, timely export reporting information, given the dramatic growth in overseas sales.</p>
<p>The American Meat Institute urged USDA not to merge meat export reporting with its current export sales report on grains, but instead to produce a report on shipments using export certificates that are issued by goverment meat inspectors.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers would not benefit from a government reporting program that tips U.S. industry's hand in the global marketplace about what American companies have contracted to sell, to whom and -- as some have suggested -- at what price,&quot; AMI wrote.</p>
<p>The deadline for comments passed last week. A USDA official said the department would now review the information received.</p>
<p>USDA has set target dates of April 30 to publish a proposed rule, September for a final rule and October for reporting to begin.</p>
