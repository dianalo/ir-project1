<p>Capricious weather and disease will combine to cut Uganda's coffee exports in 1996/97 from a bumper level achieved in the previous season, senior industry officials and state coffee agencies said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This year it has been so wet and then so dry. The weather has not been as good as last year, it is not favourable,&quot; said John Byarugaba of the Uganda Coffee Trade Federation (UCTF).</p>
<p>&quot;With disease, we expect less coffee this season,&quot; said Byarugaba adding, &quot;The spread is fast and can wipe out all robusta coffee in Uganda unless it is urgently addressed.&quot;</p>
<p>Ugandan coffee exports in 1995/96 were around 4.1 million 60-kg bags compared to 2.8 million bags in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Ugandan authorities have already forecast exports in the range of 3.6 million to 3.8 million bags in 1996/97 but drought and a faster-than-expected spread of the disease mean the figure will be much lower than that, according to industry officials.</p>
<p>Uganda exported 1,290,986 bags of coffee worth $95.2 million in the first quarter of 1996/97 (October-December) from 795,502 bags worth 88.1 million in the same period last year and said the volume was the highest per quarter realised in four years.</p>
<p>Uganda Coffee Development Authority said results in the second 1996/97 quarter would also show stronger exports but the last half of the season would carry the critical decline.</p>
<p>Coffee is Uganda's dominant foreign exchange earner.</p>
<p>Tracheomycosis or coffee wilt disease, has affected coffees from the western districts and alarmed growers.</p>
<p>Tracheomycosis destroys a coffee tree's vascular system. It leaves a black sear on the tree stem after which the tree dies.</p>
<p>It has affected 11 major growing districts in Uganda.</p>
<p>&quot;The disease does not affect the quality of beans, so it does not harm the trade in terms of quality,&quot; Byarugaba said.</p>
<p>&quot;It can harm the trade by reduced quantity because some trees are drying out,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The disease is reported to have spread to Uganda from Zaire and Byarugaba said Ugandan authorities were trying to stem a faster spread to neighbouring Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;We have formed a task force comprising traders, farmers, government officials and UCDA (Uganda Coffee Development Authority) to fight this disease,&quot; Byarugaba said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are beginning by sensitizing farmers on the symptoms, how it spreads and how it is transferred. We want to encourage growers to destroy coffee farms affected,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The UCDA policy is to uproot and burn down all affected trees and then keep affected farms free from the crop for two years. It then arranges free seedlings for farmers to replant.</p>
<p>Byarugaba said Uganda had launched a quarantine system restricting movement of robusta coffee husks across districts.</p>
<p>The disease is still widespread in the Western districts of Bundibugyo, Kabarole and Rukungiri where incidence on some smallholder farmers has reached 60-100 percent.</p>
<p>In the districts of Mukono, Luwero, Kiboga, Mpigi, Bushenyi, Hoima, Kibaale and Masindi, the disease was confirmed as localised but potentially dangerous at the current level.</p>
