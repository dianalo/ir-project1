<p>Mark McNulty coasted to his fourth tournament win in five starts with a comfortable nine-shot victory in the Wild Coast Challenge on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwean compiled a superb four-under-par 66 -- he finished with three successive birdies -- for a 10-under-par total of 270.</p>
<p>&quot;My caddy Basil (van Rooyen) said to me on the second tee we should set a target for the day and I said I would try to shoot 66. It was a great challenge for me in the wind and I'm pleased that I managed it,&quot; McNulty said.</p>
<p>&quot;And getting birdies on each of my last three holes was a pleasant bonus -- I just wish I could take my all-round game, as it is at the moment, to this year's U.S. Open.&quot;</p>
<p>Four shots ahead entering the final round, McNulty dropped just one shot. He bogeyed the eighth, played into a brisk south-westerly wind.</p>
<p>He never allowed his nearest rivals to close the gap, and, with a back nine of 32, opened up one of the largest victory margins he could remember in his professional career.</p>
<p>South African Justin Hobday (67) holed out from a greenside bunker for a birdie three at the last to finish second on 279.</p>
