<p>Pan Australian Resources NL said on Thursday that a shallow rotary air blast and reverse circulation drilling programme at its Yilgarn extension project in Western Australia had intersected significant gold mineralisation.</p>
<p>In anomaly E, a 50 metre deep hole had intersected, from a depth of 36 metres, 12 metres at 1.3 grams of gold a tonne, including four metres at 2.7 grams of gold a tonne, it said.</p>
<p>Another hole, 400 metres to the north and along the strike, intersected 16 metres at 0.4 grams of gold a tonne, including four metres at 1.2 grams of gold a tonne, it said.  </p>
<p>Managing director Gary Stafford said the results were extremely encouraging, especially when compared with geophysical and geochemical data.</p>
<p>The results and information on file indicated a mineralised trend with a strike length of at least 400 metres with a width of more than 25 metres.</p>
<p>The belt was more extensive than previously interpreted from the company's airborne geophysical data, he said.</p>
<p>Target Zone T26, about 70 kilometres south of Norseman, now contained eight identified anomalies after recent infill soil sampling detected three new anomalies.  </p>
<p>Together they represented a discontinuous, anomalous gold zone seven kilometres long and an average 600 metres wide, he said.</p>
