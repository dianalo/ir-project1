<headline>Iran's Rafsanjani says verdict row &quot;passing storm&quot;.</headline>

<p>Iran's president on Friday blasted a court ruling accusing Iran of ordering political murders in Germany, but said a diplomatic row over the verdict was a &quot;passing storm&quot; provoked by the United States and Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;The (U.S. and Israel) needed such a propaganda wave. We should expect them to keep up the noise in the West. But this will bring them nothing. It is like a thunderstorm that brings clear weather in its wake,&quot; Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a Shi'ite Moslem cleric, said in a sermon to thousands of worshippers gathered at the Tehran University campus for Friday prayers.</p>
<p>After the sermon hundreds of worshippers marched four km (2.5 miles) to the German embassy in central Tehran and many pelted the building with tomatoes in protest at the verdict.</p>
<p>The demonstrators rushed a line of riot police behind barricades at the embassy but were pushed back, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani condemned the Berlin court which ruled on Thursday that top political and religious leaders in Tehran had ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents, saying it was influenced by Iran's arch-enemies.</p>
<p>&quot;This (verdict) is a historic disgrace for the German judiciary and claims that Germany's legal system is independent are now totally in question,&quot; Rafsanjani said.</p>
<p>The speech was punctuated by chants of &quot;death to America&quot; and &quot;death to Israel&quot; from the crowds.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only were they (the court) not independent from their own government, but they were even dependent on foreigners. We have no doubt that American and Israeli agents have had a finger in this,&quot; he said in the sermon carried by Tehran radio.</p>
<p>Referring to Iran's historic ties with Germany, Rafsanjani said it was amazing that &quot;a government (Germany) would under pressure from others -- if they did not commit the error themselves -- damage a 100-year-old friendship with a country that is at the heart of world geography&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;For at least a certain time, our people will not be able to forget this unchivalrous act of the Germans that is carried out under the guise of justice and human rights,&quot; Rafsanjani said.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani told worshippers the row with Germany and the European Union was hurting German and European interests more than those of Iran and these countries would have to go back on their decisions to withdraw their ambassadors from Tehran.</p>
<p>Germany withdrew its ambassador from Tehran on Thursday and asked four Iranian diplomatic staff to leave the embassy in Bonn. Iran also recalled its ambassador and expelled four German diplomats.</p>
<p>The European Union on Thursday invited all of its members to recall their ambassadors from Tehran. Sweden, Belgium, Finland and France withdrew their ambassadors on Friday and Britain said it was recalling its charge d'affaires.</p>
<p>&quot;Was it not so in the Salman Rushdie Affair that all of them recalled their ambassadors and later disgracefully sent them back with apologies?&quot; Rafsanjani said.</p>
<p>European Community member states recalled their ambassadors in 1989 from Iran over the death edict against the British author by the late Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for alleged blasphemy. The EC allowed the envoys to return after a month and most went back to Tehran.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani said Iran was much stronger economically than in 1989 and did not need the EU. He derided the European call to recall envoys as &quot;airs put on by a 60-year-old bride&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Even America lost by cutting relations with us,&quot; Rafsanjani said, reminding the crowd that he was speaking almost exactly on the 17th anniversary of the date ties were severed by Washington.</p>
