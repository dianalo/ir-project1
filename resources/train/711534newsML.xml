<p>Italy, struggling to meet the demands of a single European currency, said on Monday it would be ready to qualify, while EU finance ministers called for greater economic policy coordination under the euro.</p>
<p>Presenting its economic convergence programme to a gathering of the bloc's 15 finance ministers, Rome was praised for its efforts to restrain spending but was also urged to take additional savings measures if necessary.</p>
<p>Rome's hopes of joining the euro in 1999 have been bolstered by expectations that the entry conditions for economic and monetary union would be eased in order to allow countries like France, seen as an essential participant, to qualify.</p>
<p>Germany, one of the EU's most vocal proponents of budgetary rigour, expressed support for the Italian government and left open the possiblity of its timely entry on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still in the middle of the year. Why shouldn't one have the chance to reach a successful conclusion,&quot; German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said when asked about Italy's ability to put its finances in order this year.</p>
<p>Governments wishing to join EMU will be judged on their economic and budget performance in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>For France, however, the question of whether the EU could allow a government that has acknowledged its 1997 deficit might be significantly higher than the Maastricht Treaty's three percent deficit-to-GDP target, remained unresolved.</p>
<p>While Germany sought to paper over differences with France over the interpretation of the euro's preconditions, others were less diplomatic.</p>
<p>&quot;France is a problem. It shouldn't be that one is looking at 3.6 percent and also at 3.0 percent. This distorts competition,&quot; Austrian finance minister Rudolf Edlinger told Austrian reporters.</p>
<p>The ministers, determined to project a united front on the planned single currency, also emphasised the need for greater economic policy coordination after EMU begins.</p>
<p>Europe's disturbingly high unemployment rate was the focus of attention at the opening of the first ministerial gathering under the Luxembourg EU presidency.</p>
<p>Led in particular by France, which has put the jobs issue at the top of the European agenda, there appeared to be broad acceptance that economic policy must be better coordinated after the euro is launched on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know good economic policy is one that pays heed to all the elements of the policy mix,&quot; said French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, adding that France remained firmly committed to the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very much closer to the finishing line now. We simply need to persevere,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The new French government uncertain budget outlook and emphasis on growth and employment has created problems for Germany, which is under intense domestic pressure not to allow a weak euro be be created.</p>
<p>Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber said in a news paper interview on Monday that a delay in the euro was preferable to a weak one.</p>
<p>One of the primary worries for EMU in the aftermath of the new French government's electoral victory is a split between Bonn and Paris over how economic policy should be managed under monetary union.</p>
<p>France has put forward a series of proposals aimed to redress the balance of power away from a European Central Bank and more towards national governments.</p>
<p>Worried that too much importance has been attached to German model of monetary stability, the French government has managed to shift the debate towards economic growth and employment.</p>
<p>The key concern for Germany, however, is avoiding a scenario which politicises the policy decisions of an independent central bank.</p>
