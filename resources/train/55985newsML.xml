<p>New York City, one of the largest issuers in the municipal market, on Monday said it had set a $1.6 billion sale of revenue anticipation notes for October 1.</p>
<p>The notes, which will be sold by competitive bid, will have two maturities, with $575 million maturing in April 1997, and $1.025 billion maturing on June 30, said Alan Anders, director of financing, Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>A city official last week said the October 1 sale of revenue anticipation notes could include as much as $550 of issues maturing at the end of March, and up to $1.25 billion of notes that would expire at the end of June.</p>
<p>Because New York state has a history of failing to approve on time its budgets, which are due on April 1, the city plans to back the June portion of the notes with a letter of credit. This is a strategy the city has used in the past, and on a net basis, will reduce its borrowing costs, Anders said.</p>
