<p>Golf course operator PGA European Tour Courses Plc said on Friday its full-year results were likely to fall &quot;materially below market expectations&quot;.</p>
<p>It also said that managing director Sean Kelly had resigned.</p>
<p>&quot;...Based on the group's current trading, the board expects that the results for this year, including the exceptional costs associated with the departure of Mr Kelly, will be materially below market expectations,&quot; the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Richard Thompson, currently non-executive chairman of the group, will become executive chairman following Kelly's resignation.</p>
<p>PGA shares were quoted 8.5p lower at 51.5p after the trading statement. The company said first-half trading had been hit by the strength of sterling and a variable performance from individual operations.</p>
<p>The company has decided to abandon its strategy of acquiring up to 20 courses to focus instead on the acquisition and development of flagship golfing venues.</p>
<p>The group also plans to develop the sale of rights from staging televised events at these venues.</p>
<p>It said the strategy was adopted after consultation with the men's professional PGA European Tour and International Management Group, both major shareholders.</p>
<p>Ken Schofield, executive director of the PGA Tour, and IMG Europe managing director Ian Todd will join the PGA board as non-executive directors.</p>
