<p>Slovenian shares eased on Tuesday on low turnover as investors huddled on the sidelines, waiting for the November 10 general elections, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not enough fresh money on the market and we could expect some fresh money just after elections,&quot; Davor Dubokovic, a trader at Eastbrokers said.</p>
<p>The SBI index fell 2.01 points or 0.17 percent to 1,188.10. Overall 14 shares were untraded, five fell and five rose.</p>
<p>Turnover fell to 92.6 million tolars from 107.7 million.</p>
<p>Traders said that turnover was expected to remain low until the elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>Bank SKB was the most actively traded and also the biggest gainer, firming 3.61 percent to 41,600 tolars on volume of 983 shares for total turnover of 40.2 million tolars.</p>
<p>Financial consultancy Dadas was the leading decliner, shedding 37.70 percent to 11,500 tolars on volume of 256 shares for total turnover of 2.8 million tolars.</p>
<p>Brokerage Dadas, owned by financial consultancy Dadas has been banned from trading on the Ljubljana bourse on Tuesday due to alleged illegal trading practices.</p>
<p>&quot;I think today's ban of brokerage Dadas from trading did not influence the market significantly, because serious investors have been avoiding it for a long time anyway,&quot; Dubokovic added.</p>
<p>Since March, shares of financial consultancy Dadas, have plunged more than 95 percent.</p>
