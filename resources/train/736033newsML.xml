<p>The United States on Thursday renewed its determination to take indicted Bosnian war criminals into custody despite attacks on Western interests since a NATO arrest operation last week.</p>
<p>Testifying before Congress, Bosnia envoy Robert Gelbard called apprehension of war criminals the top U.S. priority, and he sought to portray the allies as unified on this issue, asserting that NATO members jointly approved last week's move to capture two Bosnian Serb suspects.</p>
<p>&quot;If local authorities refuse to abide by their obligation to arrest indicted war criminals, we will continue to look for other ways to secure their capture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The warning applies &quot;not just to Bosnia but Croatia and Serbia&quot; too, he told a Senate Foreign Relations subommittee.</p>
<p>Referring to the chief Bosnian Serb wartime leader, Gelbard said: &quot;It is time for Radovan Karadzic to be delivered to The Hague and for the (Bosnian Serb) government to function on the basis of the rule of law, rather than as the private fiefdom of a corrupt war lord.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States and its allies have long insisted there can be no peace in Bosnia until indicted war criminals like Karadzic are brought to trial before the international war crimes tribunal at The Hague.</p>
<p>Although signers of the 1995 Dayton peace accords like Bosnian Serb and Serbian leaders pledged cooperation, few suspects are in custody. NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia did not use their authority to arrest suspects until British troops moved last week in Prijedor to seize two suspects.</p>
<p>Since then, Bosnian Serbs have threatened retaliation against NATO and there have been a number of attacks, including the stabbing of a U.S. soldier.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have been vague about possible further NATO operations, prompting several senators on the subcommittee and other witnesses to press for action.</p>
<p>Sen. Joseph Biden, the panel's senior Democrat, said he remained concerned that political will was lacking.</p>
<p>He cited a meeting two weeks ago in which a high-ranking American military official -- later identified by sources as Gen. George Joulwan, NATO's supreme commander -- discussed Bosnia with NATO's permanent representatives in Brussels.</p>
<p>The general told the envoys the alliance could get the indicted war criminals but needed to know that &quot;if that action were taken there would be political support from all of you for having done that,&quot; Biden related.</p>
<p>Joulwan then said, &quot;now how do you vote and ... the room was deafeningly silent. Not a single solitary NATO representative said go get 'em ... none,&quot; Biden related.</p>
<p>The general did not disagree with arresting war criminals but complained &quot;there's no political will,&quot; the senator said.</p>
<p>Gelbard stressed that since then the NATO operation in Prijedor took place &quot;and those same permanent reps knew about it and it did take place.&quot; He also noted the arrest was not an independent British operation, or a British-U.S. operation but an operation carried out under NATO.</p>
<p>Gelbard reiterated a newly aggressive U.S. intention to withhold economic aid and political recognition from parties that thwart full implementation of the Dayton peace accords.</p>
<p>When a donors conference on Bosnia is held in Brussels next week, an escrow fund may be created for Bosnian Serbs, he said. That group so far has received little or no international aid and such a fund would be tangible evidence of what they are losing out on by refusing to cooperate.</p>
<p>Gelbard gave strong support for Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic in her struggle against opposition from Karadzic and other hardliners. He said her message -- that a small group of Bosnian Serbs are enriching themselves while the rest sink deeper into isolation and poverty -- has struck a responsive chord in the Bosnian Serb republic.</p>
