<p>Egyptian shares rose on Wednesday to their highest level in about two years despite what brokers said was as a quiet market marked profit-taking.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) overall index rose 0.49 points to 239.52 points, its highest level since early December 1994. Volume reached 60.03 million pounds ($17.66 million).</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still quiet,&quot; said broker Youssef Khalil of Delta EAB. &quot;But this is usual with profit-taking dealings after recent increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Telemisr/Arab Radio Transistor and Electronics Supplies was the day's biggest gainer after recent losses. The share rose 2.02 pounds, or 7.35 percent, closing at 29.53 pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;There are rumours in the market about a close agreement between Telemisr and Japan's NEC to allow the Japanese firm to buy an anchor investor stake in Telemisr,&quot; Hany el-Sayyed of el-Rashad Securities Brokerage.</p>
<p>Central and West Delta Flour Mills was the day's most active share rising 0.99 pounds to close at 58.25. Shares worth 1.02 million pounds changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;The millers are generally on a selling trend after their good performance recently,&quot; Khalil said.</p>
<p>The cement sector, another favourite sector, dominated the market.</p>
<p>Suez Cement was the second most active share. Shares worth 789,747 pounds were traded, but ended down 0.25 pounds to 48.70.</p>
<p>Egyptian Tora Portland Cement shed 0.05 pounds to close at 62.26 pounds. Alexandria Portland Cement added 5.00 pounds to finish at 485.00.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms rose to 359.47 points from 358.79 on Tuesday and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 168.66 from 168.29 points.</p>
<p>Advances outnumbered declines 18 to 16, while 30 shares ended unchanged.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.40 pounds</p>
