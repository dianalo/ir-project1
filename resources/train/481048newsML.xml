<title>CANADA: Toronto stocks end down on rate jitters, Bre-X.</title>
<headline>Toronto stocks end down on rate jitters, Bre-X.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks ended weaker on Wednesday, shedding Tuesday's gains as interest rate jitters and the Bre-X Minerals saga dragged the market lower.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index fell 51.23 points to 5849.14 in brisk turnover of 90.7 million shares worth C$1.36 billion ($985 million).</p>
<p>Declining stocks outpaced advances 549 to 400, with 292 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>The key index lost slightly more than the 50.15 points it gained in Tuesday's session. &quot;The market was spooked by the fear of rising (U.S.) interest rates,&quot; said Ira Katzin, an investment adviser with RBC Dominion Securities.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 94 points on investor fears that a further hike in U.S. interest rates would signal a slowing economy and weaker growth in corporate profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, Canadian rates would have to follow suit or the Canadian dollar would collapse,&quot; Katzin said. The Canadian currency ended firmer on Wednesday, but analysts expected the recent weak trend to continue if Friday's U.S. payrolls data showed signs of inflation.</p>
<p>The other major weight on the Toronto market was Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its controversial Busang gold discovery.</p>
<p>Shares in the Canadian gold prospector resumed trading on Wednesday, but massive trading volumes again overwhelmed a creaky computer system on the Toronto exchange.</p>
<p>Bre-X fell 0.65 to 3.20 on massive volume of 11.7 million shares before trading was stopped due to technical problems.</p>
<p>Trading was not interrupted on the Montreal Exchange where Bre-X closed down 0.35 at 3.15 on 6.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Among other hot stocks:</p>
<p>* Bema Gold Corp. rose 0.70 to 10.30 on 1.8 million shares after the mining firm released favorable resource estimates for a Chilean gold project.</p>
<p>* Northern Telecom Ltd. was the top loser, falling 3 to 89 on 370,400 shares.</p>
<p>* Conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. dropped 0.80 to close at 32.55 on 1.2 million shares.</p>
<p>* Software maker Cognos Inc. led net gainers, climbing 2.35 to 39.50 on 62,000 shares.</p>
