<p>Movie star Sylvester Stallone's two-month-old daughter has a hole in the heart and the actor and his fiancee Jennifer Flavin are taking &quot;the necessary steps&quot; concerning the girl's health, Stallone's publicist said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Paul Bloch said the baby, Sophia Rose, born on Aug. 27 in Miami, had been diagnosed with a hole in the heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Stallone says they are taking the necessary steps,&quot; Bloch said, without elaborating on whether the baby was undergoing or about to undergo surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;He and Miss Flavin are concerned, but optimistic about the outcome,&quot; Bloch told Reuters.</p>
<p>The couple's first baby weighed 7 pounds 4 ounces (3.28 kilograms), when she was born at South Miami Hospital. At the time, Bloch said both mother and baby were in &quot;wonderful health.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Stallone, best known for the &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Rambo&quot; movies, left the set of &quot;Copland&quot;, which was filming in New York and New Jersey, to be with Flavin, a model, for the birth. The couple live in Florida.</p>
