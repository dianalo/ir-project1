<p>Italy said on Thursday it was weighing different options to prove its commitment to budgetary rigour as it campaigns to join the single European currency in the first wave.</p>
<p>But financial markets took the hesitation as a sign that the centre-left government was split and dithering on cutting the budget deficit, a key criterion for joining European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Government politicians said the coalition was mulling whether to draft a mini-budget soon and pass next year's budget on schedule by December, or to go straight for an early 1998 package.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi has floated the idea of bringing the 1998 budget forward to try to dispel doubts in Germany and other European Union countries about Italy's fitness for founder membership of EMU.</p>
<p>But opposition centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi said Prodi was now rowing back from the idea.</p>
<p>Political commentators say the indecision partly reflects Prodi's dependence on the hard-left Communist Refoundation for his parliamentary majority. The party opposes a mini-budget and has threatened to bring Prodi down if he cuts welfare spending.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said the 1998 budget did not necessarily have to be passed early. But, speaking in Singapore, he said &quot;additional measures&quot; could be passed if state accounts showed the need.</p>
<p>Referring to an early budget, Finance Minister Vicenzo Visco said: &quot;If it is useful and possible it will be done.&quot; But he added: &quot;There's no rush, even if clarification for the markets would be a positive factor.&quot;</p>
<p>Mounting concern that Prodi's coalition lacks the political will to tackle the budget deficit and reforms of the pension system weighed on bond and share markets.</p>
<p>&quot;There's delaying and discussion among the coalition on making a mini-budget,&quot; said one debt futures broker in London. &quot;We need quick action and a quick decision ... There's a fear of facing the real problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Any measures would follow hard on the heels of Prodi's 1997 budget, drawn up to cut 62.5 trillion lire ($37.6 billion) off the 1997 deficit. The government is targeting a 1997 deficit of 61.4 trillion lire after 138.5 trillion last year, well above forecast.</p>
<p>Prodi has already said that any mini-budget to compensate for the overshoot would cut spending, putting the government on a potential collision course with Communist Refoundation.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said the government was waiting for official state accounts, which are due out by early March, before making up its mind on a mini-budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not excluding anything. We want to take a serious look at the accounts and then on the basis of that, we'll decide,&quot; he said. Data in so far were comforting, he added.</p>
<p>Berlusconi has offered to work with the coalition on an early 1998 budget in return for a combined assault on Italy's costly welfare bill, but Prodi has ruled out any shifts in parliamentary alliances to push through reforms.</p>
<p>Berlusconi on Thursday repeated his offer, which hinges on guarantees over the contents of the finance package, saying he knew &quot;that the state accounts are going badly&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government has second thoughts, we are always here and will show a sense of responsibility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>European Commissioner Mario Monti said Italy should err on the side of caution and &quot;nothing should be done to damage&quot; efforts to join EMU at its 1999 launch.</p>
<p>An early budget could help to convince EU partners of &quot;the stability and sustainability&quot; of Italian finances, he said. ($1=1,658 lire)</p>
