<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine bonds rise after Greenspan testimony.</title>
<headline>Argentine bonds rise after Greenspan testimony.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-07-21</dateline>

<p>Argentine bonds pushed higher in late trading Tuesday, cheered by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet at first, waiting for Greenspan to speak, and then it got a huge boost,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Prices are now near last week's highest levels and we think there's a very good chance they will keep rising short term.&quot;</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 tacked on 3/4 to 94-5/8, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.09 to 118.2.</p>
<p>In his semi-annual Humphrey Hawkins address to Congress Greenspan said U.S. growth was likely to slow and the country's healthy economic expansion could reflect a new relationship between wages and inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan is no longer hinting this economic scenario is about to suffer changes, like he did in February. All in all he sounded much more confident that today's low unemployment rates are not a threat to the economy,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>He noted U.S. long bond yields fell to 6.42 percent from 6.54 percent on Monday on the back of Greenspan's comments.</p>
<p>&quot;This makes Bradies more attractive,&quot; he added.</p>
