<headline>Dated Brent set to plunge, other grades steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dated Brent was offered aggressively lower on Wednesday, but differentials for other North Sea grades were steady, traders said.</p>
<p>A Brent cargo loading June 12-14 which was passed through the paper chains on Wednesday and kept by BP, was reoffered late in the afternoon at July Brent -20 cents, 23 cents off a trade on Tuesday and 37 cents off last week's traded high.</p>
<p>Traders said that Brent was ripe for a fall having been kept artificially high by a trading house trying to support a CFD position.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been coming off steadily but it's ready to really drop now,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Two other Brent cargoes which were originally nominated loading dates on Wednesday were deferred.</p>
<p>CFDs were also under pressure with next week's dates (June 2-6) heard sold at July Brent -28 cents, and June 16-20 at August -35 cents, or the equivalent to around July -23 cents. The following week was traded twice at August Brent -34 cents.</p>
<p>July Brent was trading two cents higher at $19.24 a barrel on the IPE screen at 1711 GMT, having traded on the paper market at $19.32 and $19.23.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads were also weaker, with July/August traded at a low of -14 cents.</p>
<p>But other North Sea grades, having failed to respond to Brent's galloping gains last week, held steady.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a separate market and it's pretty well supported, there's some good refinery demand out there,&quot; said one Norwegian producer.</p>
<p>A June 21-23 Oseberg traded at Dated Brent +15 cents, a Statfjord loading June 6-8 fetched Dated Brent +33 cents, while a Beryl traded earlier at a healthy Dated Brent +$1.00.</p>
