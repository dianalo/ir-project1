<p>South African President Nelson Mandela held talks with Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila on Wednesday amid signs that Kabila could soon meet the man he is trying to topple, President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Mandela and Kabila shook hands on the steps of the South African president's Tuynhuys offices in Cape Town before starting one-on-one talks. They declined to speak to reporters.</p>
<p>Sources close to the talks said representatives of Mobutu were in Cape Town as well but it was not clear if they would meet Kabila. U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun is also in the city.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa, Zairean Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba told a news conference Mobutu and Kabila could meet directly once their envoys had consulted.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are getting clearer. Plans are afoot for a meeting between the head of state and the rebel leader. This meeting is imminent,&quot; Kin-Kiey said.</p>
<p>A senior South African source said Mandela wanted to bring Mobutu and Kabila together in South Africa as part of his efforts to end the civil war in Zaire.</p>
<p>Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad, who was instrumental in arranging an earlier round of talks in South Africa between representatives of the Zairean rivals, was expected to join Wednesday's talks at some stage.</p>
<p>Kabila arrived in Cape Town from Lubumbashi, Zaire's second city which rebels seized last week after only token resistance from Mobutu's troops. The rebels now hold more than half of the mineral-rich country.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters before leaving Lubumbashi, Kabila reasserted that nothing would halt his drive to unseat Mobutu.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no ceasefire until Mobutu relinquishes power,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kabila, head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), had earlier told Reuters by telephone that the &quot;people are against a ceasefire&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The people do not want a ceasefire, they want an end to this corrupt regime,&quot; said Kabila.</p>
<p>After crippling Kinshasa with an anti-Mobutu protest action on Monday and Tuesday, Zaire's main opposition called a meeting of its leadership on Wednesday to plan further measures.</p>
<p>&quot;We will launch new measures for the coming week. The action will continue,&quot; declared Mukendi wa Kamanda, chief political aide to opposition stalwart Etienne Tshisekedi.</p>
<p>Shops and businesses reopened on Wednesday and the city regained its normal pace after a well-observed stay-at-home protest on Monday. Police thwarted a student protest march on Tuesday but Kinshasa residents stayed at home all the same.</p>
<p>Kabila's rebels say they are now 300 km (180 miles) from Kinshasa, a claim ridiculed by the Zaire government and questioned by independent military analysts.</p>
<p>But given the inability of Zaire's undisciplined army to offer resistance, many Zaireans doubt government forces will be capable of holding Kinshasa.</p>
<p>Kabila's alliance signed on Wednesday a $1 billion deal with America Mineral Fields Inc in the hopes will resurrect the fabled mineral wealth of Shaba province.</p>
