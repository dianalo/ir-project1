<p>British investment company 3I Group Plc is seeing strong growth in demand from management to buy-out their own companies and outside managers eager to buy-in, Richard Campin, local director of 3I, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is plenty of cash around for MBO's and also plenty of good management around for MBI's and there are a lot of corporates with portfolios of companies which perhaps don't fit as they might,&quot; said Campin in an interview.</p>
<p>Under a management buy-in (MBI), 3I provides the risk finance to allow a new mamangement team to take over a company with growth potential while management buy-outs (MBO)allow existing management to buy their own company.</p>
<p>&quot;So we will see more disposals by corporates of non-core subsidiaries which could go to an MBO or MBI. There are also quite a lot of private companies inclined to sell,&quot; said Campin. 3I is currently working on eight MBO's or MBI's well up on last year, but Campin refused to give details of the deals.</p>
<p>In the six years since 1990, 3I has funded 112 deals of 10 million stg or more, NatWest invested in 44 and CinVen in 39 over the same period. In London, 3I did 33 deals in the period. London based 3I specialises in small-to-medium-sized companies looking for funding of 10 to 150 million stg.</p>
<p>A fairly stable interest rate environment over that period has made funding easier and a more entrepreneurial management culture has emerged, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The last four years have been very buouyant for us,&quot; said Campin. 3I is due to report its full year results on June 5. The group reported pretax profits of 97.5 million stg in the year to September 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Earlier, 3I agreed to back a management buy-in team for Prepared Foods Group from British food distributor Booker Plc. 3I provided equity of 29 million stg and debt funding came from Robert Fleming to make up the 57 million stg cost of the business.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe there is strong capital growth in this business. I would hope we would double the value of our investment over four years. I believe we have backed a management team of exceptional quality and I think they can grow the profits,&quot; said Campin.</p>
