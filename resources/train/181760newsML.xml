<p>Negotiations for troubled Swedish soccer player Tomas Brolin to move to Italy's Sampdoria from England's Leeds United have broken down, Swedish television reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Television quoted the Italian Serie A team's Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson as saying it was virtually certain that the striker attacker would not return to Italy.</p>
<p>Brolin has been drifting since he left Italy's Parma last year for Leeds. He became involved in a feud with former Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson and has not been able to agree terms with new Leeds boss George Graham.</p>
<p>The Swedish tabloid daily Expressen said Brolin had been set to sign on loan for Sampdoria, which would have paid his salary before signing him.</p>
<p>Brolin, a talented and speedy attacker who never came to terms with the tough nature of English soccer, has threatened to hang his boots up after Graham sought to prevent him playing anywhere but for Leeds.</p>
<p>Eriksson has himself become the subject of rumours that he was on his way to manage English premier league side Blackburn Rovers.</p>
<p>But the Swede denied the rumours on Tuesday, telling the Swedish news agency TT: &quot;I have never spoken to Blackburn. I have a contract with Sampdoria until next June and I intend to honour it.&quot;</p>
