<p>Lord Arnold Weinstock, who steps down on Friday after 33 years as head of one of Britain's top industrial groups, The General Electric Company(GEC), ruled with an iron will and was recognised for his sharp business brain.</p>
<p>In more than 33 years at the helm of GEC Plc, the orphaned son of a Jewish tailor turned a tiny firm, on the verge of ruin when he took over as managing director in 1963, into an industrial giant rich in cash.</p>
<p>A controversial master dealmaker, he displayed his autocratic style and forceful personality by bending company rules to remain at his post until after his 72nd birthday.</p>
<p>On his departure he leaves a company with profits exceeding 1.0 billion pounds ($1.56 billion) before exceptional charges, a huge cash pile and an equally impressive order book.</p>
<p>British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine described Weinstock as &quot;one of the great industrialists of the second half of the 20th century&quot;</p>
<p>In taking &quot;the GEC&quot;, as he calls it, into the top ranks of electronics suppliers and defence and power contractors, he also built a reputation as a man of firm beliefs and few words.</p>
<p>Weinstock used takeovers to lead GEC through an era of great industrial change and transformed it from an electrical appliance maker into an international conglomerate.</p>
<p>His entrance to the corporate world had come after he married Netta Sobell in 1949 and five years later went to work for her father Michael's TV and radio company, Radio and Allied.</p>
<p>After becoming managing director of this business by 1955 and revitalising it, Weinstock did a reverse takeover of the much bigger but ailing GEC in 1961.</p>
<p>First he expanded it through a series of mergers in the 1960s. Later, when governments blocked his attempts to do the same internationally, he forged big joint ventures with French firms Alcatel Alsthom and Matra, and with Siemens AG of Germany.</p>
<p>His talents were widely acknowleged and one of his contemporaries in the 1960s dubbed him &quot;the vanguard of a new type of British tycoon&quot;.</p>
<p>Some called his string of takeovers &quot;the most important Britain had seen for more than 50 years&quot; as Weinstock created what ranked as the biggest company in Britain in 1982.</p>
<p>Right into his 34th year at GEC the London stock market repeated one of the most enduring rumours of the last decade -- that Weinstock was on the warpath to force a defence industry merger with arch-rival British Aerospace Plc.</p>
<p>But despite his reputation as a corporate warrior, the lover of classical music and racehorses felt industrial re-organisation was more akin to sculpting in marble.</p>
<p>&quot;First you take a hammer and knock the material into shape,&quot; he said, &quot;then you go to work with a chisel.&quot;</p>
<p>His intense management style led to conflict later with some institutional investors who felt Weinstock closed GEC off to outside influences and ideas.</p>
<p>Comparisons with the growth rates of GEC's rivals showed the firm was growing without making an entry into any of the really fast-moving technology sectors that helped other companies accelerate profits in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Such criticism came to the fore after 1994 when Weinstock said he would stay on another two years as managing director.</p>
<p>Even the pay and bonus package announced this summer for his successor, George Simpson, was so strongly derided for its feeble performance targets that it had to be revised just days before the formal handover.</p>
<p>And few of his British industral rivals were sure that the man they call &quot;Arnie&quot; would be able to resist keeping one hand on the GEC tiller in future in his honorary post of Chairman Emeritus.</p>
<p>Born on July 29, 1924, Weinstock was orphaned at nine and at 16 entered the London School of Economics to study statistics. His only son Simon, who as commercial director of GEC was once rumoured to succeed him, died of cancer earlier this year at the age of 44. He also has a daughter.</p>
<p>Weinstock was knighted in 1970 for services to export and made a life peer in Britain's House of Lords in 1980. ($1=.6396 Pound)</p>
