<p>The Afghan Taleban militia battled to the eastern edge of Kabul on Wednesday, threatening the survival of President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government.</p>
<p>Taleban sources said the rebels had captured Pul-i-Charki village on the outskirts of the city, as well as the military academy.</p>
<p>Government sources in Kabul confirmed the Taleban were at the gates of the city, but denied the military academy had fallen. The Taleban said fighting had moved on to the customs house area, only five km (three miles) from the city.</p>
<p>Government jets were bombing the Taleban, who were attacking Kabul from the east, south and southwest, rebel sources said.</p>
<p>U.N. staff in Kabul said there were chaotic scenes in the city with tanks and military vehicles on the move as the Taleban forces advanced. They had no word on casualties.</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) prepared to send two planes to Kabul on Thursday to evacuate foreigners wanting to leave, an ICRC official in Pakistan said.</p>
<p>Taleban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar called on troops loyal to Rabbani to stop fighting because their leader was &quot;preparing to flee&quot;, Omar's spokesman Wakil Ahmed said from Taleban headquarters in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. Omar offered an amnesty to anyone who joined the Taleban.</p>
<p>The Taleban, who emerged from the obscurity of religious schools in Pakistan two years ago, have been fighting to oust Rabbani and impose a strict Islamic order across Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Afghan government has often accused Pakistan of supporting the Taleban. Islamabad denies the charge.</p>
<p>Omar said the Taleban had no ethnic or regional prejudices and only wanted to enforce Islamic sharia (law).</p>
<p>The Islamic rebels thrust rapidly up the main highway to the capital through the precipitous Kabul gorge after seizing the key town of Sarobi, 70 km (44 miles) from Kabul, during the night.</p>
<p>U.N. special envoy Norbert Holl urged factions battling for Kabul to stop fighting and avert civilian casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;My message is: spare the lives of the innocent civilians who have already suffered enough from years of useless bloodshed,&quot; said Holl in a statement issued in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He appealed to all factions to observe an immediate ceasefire and start talks on a lasting settlement.</p>
<p>Holl urged &quot;those countries with influence in Afghanistan to persuade the warring parties to abandon the course of war and cooperate with the United Nations&quot; in the search for peace.</p>
<p>But the Taleban appeared determined to keep up their military momentum and seize the prize of Kabul, following their spectacular gains in eastern Afghanistan this month.</p>
<p>The government, hemmed in by the Taleban, turned to opposition militia commander General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who controls Kabul's last supply route to the north.</p>
<p>An Islamabad-based official of Dostum's Jumbish-i-Milli faction said Interior Minister Yunus Qanuni was holding talks with Dostum in Uzbekistan's capital Tashkent on Wednesday. Dostum is in Tahkent for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Dostum is a foe of Rabbani, but is despised by the Taleban for his communist past. Last month he reopened the Salang highway linking Kabul to the north under an informal truce.</p>
