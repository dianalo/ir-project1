<p>COMEX copper ended slightly weaker after bids to break on the upside failed, leaving the market to slip back and glean further momentum from an expected drop in LME stocks Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Spot COMEX ran up to 112.00 cents a lb, its highest since just before the Sumitomo copper crash mid-June last year.</p>
<p>William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch said that despite initial gains, the market continued to buck against key resistance levels, but an anticipated drop of 3,000 to 6,000 tonnes in LME stocks Friday may help a break through.</p>
<p>&quot;The spreads are indicating we are going to eventually break through that area,&quot; O'Neill said.</p>
<p>LME cash to three months spread or backwardation nudged higher to $290/$300 as tightness on LME between end of January and mid-February neared.</p>
<p>March COMEX settled 0.20 cent weaker at 107.10 cents, traded 108.20 to 106.70 cents. January went out 0.05 cent firmer at 111.30 cents.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at a moderate 7,500 lots compared to Wednesday's official 4,894 lots.</p>
