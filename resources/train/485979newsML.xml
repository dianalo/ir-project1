<p>German authorities said on Thursday they had arrested a man suspected of being a leading member of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and of organising attacks as part of its campaign for autonomy from Turkey.</p>
<p>The Federal Prosecutor's Office said the Kurd, whom it identified only as Nasir C., was suspected of being &quot;a member of a terrorist organisation&quot; and of ordering arson attacks and destruction of Turkish property in Germany.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the 23-year-old led the PKK's north German division from 1992 until February 1994, when he took over the European leadership of the Berlin-based Kurdish Intellectual Association, closely linked to the PKK.</p>
<p>Germany banned the PKK after a spectacular spate of attacks on Turkish properties across Germany and Europe in 1993.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Nasir C., detained in Berlin on April 1 and formally placed under arrest on Wednesday, had organised two series of attacks in 1993 on Turkish property, including a social club, banks, airline firms and travel agencies.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 people have died over the past 12 years in the guerrilla war against Turkish rule which the PKK is waging in eastern Turkey.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of troops, backed by air power, have been sweeping the region in a spring offensive against the rebels since last weekend. Security officials said 43 rebels had been killed so far.</p>
