<p>October spot power prices in the western U.S. slipped Monday after Bonneville Power Administration decreased its prices for pre-scheduled power during peak-demand hours.</p>
<p>&quot;They (BPA) came out more aggressively than we expected,&quot; said one cash power trader. &quot;Daily prices were already down, but there has been on impact on October (cash prices).&quot;</p>
<p>Market sources also said moderate weather conditions were capping regional demand.</p>
<p>Bonneville offered power between 1000 and 2100 PDT on Tuesday at $18.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), compared with $20.00 for similar hours on Monday.</p>
<p>Power at Palo Verde for October was quoted 16.30-16.70 per MWh, down from 16.50-16.70 on Friday. October California-Oregon border (COB) electricity was quoted $15.90-16.25, compared with 16.20-16.40 on Friday.</p>
<p>Next-day deliveries at COB were quoted $17.00-18.00, unchanged from Friday. Mid-Columbia prices were steady at $16.00-17.00.</p>
<p>Palo Verde daily prices were quoted $21.00-23.00, also little changed from Friday.</p>
<p>Recent weather forecasts calling for above-normal precipitation in the Northwest could put further downward pressure on spot prices, noted another trade source.</p>
<p>In California, utility sources said they are considering bringing idled natural gas-fired units back on line if northwest hydroelectric prices continue at current levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas is still pretty inexpensive for us,&quot; said one utility trader. &quot;It might be cheaper than paying $18.00&quot; for spot power.</p>
