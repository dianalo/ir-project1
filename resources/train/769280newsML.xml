<title>MALAYSIA: KL overnight rises to 8.8 pct on market tightness.</title>
<headline>KL overnight rises to 8.8 pct on market tightness.</headline>

<p>The overnight interbank rate rose to 8.80 percent on Thursday, helped by market tightness and month-end ringgit demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>It closed at 8.50/70 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A Bank Negara agent was earlier lending at 8.8 percent but we do not know if it was on behalf of the central bank,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>Bank Negara has been injecting fresh funds into the market for the past two weeks to help eased the shortage, dealers said.</p>
<p>Recent heavy buying of the ringgit by the central bank to defend the currency from speculative attack had caused a liquidity squeeze.</p>
<p>But despite the central bank lending, the market was too short to prevent a spike up in rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said with the market still short of funds, only the central bank could determine where rates are heading.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, nobody knows what Bank Negara wants to do,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Earlier, one- and two-week money were at 8.70/80 percent against 8.50/70 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>One-month money was at 8.60/70 percent from 8.50 percent, and three-month was at 8.45/50 percent against 8.30 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said rates might come off slightly on Friday due to maturity of Bank Negara bills worth 500 million ringgit.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were down across the board to reflect firmer interbank rates.</p>
<p>At 0830 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was down five points to 92.18, or an implied yield of 7.82 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract fell two to 92.46, or 7.54 percent while March 1998 was down one to 92.56, or 7.44 percent.</p>
