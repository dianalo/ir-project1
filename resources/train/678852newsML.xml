<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian Commodities Roundup - June 23.</title>
<headline>Australian Commodities Roundup - June 23.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Zinc prices charged to near seven-year highs and nickel bounced more than $100, but other metals finished with a whimper. Gold, wheat and oil were all easier, while the CRB index was down 2.43 at 240.52.</p>
<p>METALS - Fresh speculative interest tipped zinc over the $1,400 mark in inter-office trading ahead of the afternoon session on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Zinc achieved a top price of $1,405, its highest since October 1990, but profit-taking saw three months metal slightly lower at $1,399 by the end of the kerb, still up $6 from Thursday's finish.  </p>
<p>Nickel picked up towards the end of the trading day finishing $110 stronger at $7,270, the day's high. Prices bounced sharply on shortcovering after probing support just below the day's low of $7,130, analysts said. Traders said the market was closely watching developments at the strike-bound Inco Sudbury facilities.</p>
<p>Flagship copper failed to broach the key $2,600 resistance level early in the day. It ended near the day's low at $2,567, compared to Thursday's $2,585.50.</p>
<p>Aluminium was disheartened by lack of progress towards $1,600 resistance and ended the week $6 easier at $1,578. Quiet lead  </p>
<p>was last indicated at $622/623, compared to $624, while tin was off $25 at $5,590. Alloy was last indicated slightly easier at $1,465/1,470.</p>
<p>GOLD - COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures diverged Friday, with nearby gold futures registering new life-of-contract lows, spot gold in the bullion market logging its lowest weekly close since 1993, and platinum group metal (PGM) futures edging back up. COMEX August gold ended down $3.00 at $339.40 an ounce, after seeing a new contract low at $339.10. In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $337.40/90, the  </p>
<p>lowest weekly close since April 1993.</p>
<p>WHEAT - CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed lower on harvest pressure with commercial selling tied to hedge selling again a feature in new crop July, traders said. A six-month low was notched in new crop July as that month touched $3.32-1/4 per bushel, the lowest level since $3.30 was traded on December 11. CBOT wheat futures closed unchanged to 2-1/4 cents per bushel lower, with July down 2-1/4 at $3.34-3/4 a bushel.  </p>
<p>OIL - NYMEX gasoline ended lower, reaching a new contract low in the spot month intraday, as ample supply continued to dog the refined product even amid high demand. July crude ended off 12 cents at $18.55 a barrel.</p>
<p>SUGAR - CSCE world sugar futures settled sharply lower amid brisk and steady speculative liquidation, trading sources said. The July contract closed 0.31 cents lower at 11.06 cents per lb, and traded 11.38 to 11.05 cents. Most-active October ended down 0.30 cents at 11.03 cents, while the rest of the board settled 0.23 to 0.14 cents weaker.  </p>
