<p> ----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - MAY 28 --------------</p>
<p>*    Crude is expected to bottom around $19.12 with a bullish up-gap between the May 9 low of $18.93 and May 10's opening trade of $19 a barrel likely to provide solid support.</p>
<p>*   The market is expected to bottom around $19.12 a barrel --the high trade of March 3 when a long legged Doji formation for that day saw the market rally to $20.84.</p>
<p>Technical analysts remain bullish for Brent crude futures, despite Tuesday's losses and short term fundamental weakness, bullish up-gap support remains intact and offers a longer term platform to move higher from.</p>
<p>The front month Brent contract fell through support at $19.75 and breached the May 16 low, when funds related buying rallied the market to $20.60 to end 78 cents lower at $19.22 a barrel on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brokers said crude and products futures were hit by long liquidation by the small funds after the markets upside momentum slowed, but the bigger funds were still holding on.</p>
<p>&quot;The bigger funds will sit on it for a while, they are holding long positions from $17.80 up to around $20.50,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Analysts expected crude prices to bottom around $19.12 with a bullish up-gap between the May 9 low of $19.93 and May 10's opening trade of $19 a barrel likely to provide solid support.</p>
<p>&quot;Tuesday's weakness exceeded expectations, but the long term bullish case remains on very firm ground,&quot; said Al Graham of Elliott Wave International, Gainesville, Georgia.</p>
<p>He said he expected the market to bottom around $19.12 a barrel.</p>
<p>This number represents the high trade of March 3 when a long legged Doji formation for that day saw the market rally to $20.84 which forms the neckline of a reverse head and shoulders pattern on the front month continuation chart.</p>
<p>According to Japanese candlestick charting techniques the formation of a second Doji today, with trading expected to remain quiet and in a narrow range ahead of the delayed API U.S. stock figures, could flag a retracement of Tuesdays losses, analysts said.</p>
<p>The picture for gas oil is not so bullish with Tuesday's fall to a $171.75 low filling the supportive up-gap.</p>
<p>That lay between May 16's $173 close and May 19's $176.50 opening.</p>
<p>June gas oil closed $5.75 lower at $172.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders attributed NYMEX crude's softness to technical weakness as well as an increasingly lacklustre gasoline season.</p>
<p>NYMEX July crude oil futures breached a succession of key chart points during its decline Tuesday, including the 10-day moving average of $21.61 and the 20-day moving average of $20.81, where support was expected to be strong.</p>
<p>The next key technical support level for July NYMEX crude was seen in the area of $20.50.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think many of the funds were comfortable below $21.50,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was waiting for the weekly American Petroleum Institute stocks estimates to assess their next move.</p>
<p>On ACCESS July crude oil was bid $20.79 a barrel, unchanged after closing down 84 cents a barrel in the floor session.</p>
<p>July heating oil was bid 55.25 cents a gallon, up slightly after closing down 2.26 cents at 55.22 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>July gasoline was bid 63 cents a gallon unchanged after settling off 1.90 cents a gallon on the day.</p>
<p>Aside from the current volatility, lurking in the background is the perception that the market's fundamentals are growing consistently weaker.</p>
<p>Neither crude oil inventories nor refinery capacity utilisation rates are expected to have declined significantly from last week's levels, traders said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Crude markets typically look for demand in the unleaded gasoline market during peak summer driving periods, and although unleaded gasoline inventories are about seven million barrels below last year, crude inventories and refinery capacity utilisation in the key U.S. market continue to remain high.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot depends on what products do, and right now the products are coming off. Unless gasoline can take the ball and run with it, over time the fundamentals are less favourable,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst John Saucer.</p>
