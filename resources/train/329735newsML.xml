<title>UK: JOURNALISTS TESTIFY IN BRITISH SOCCER BRIBE CASE.</title>
<headline>JOURNALISTS TESTIFY IN BRITISH SOCCER BRIBE CASE.</headline>
<dateline>WINCHESTER, England 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Journalists from Britain's top-selling Sun newspaper told a court on Friday that former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar denied taking money to fix soccer games despite being told they had taped evidence.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar is accused with former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers of rigging matches. Former soccer star John Fashanu and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim are accused of being middlemen in the alleged scam, working for an Asian gaming syndicate. All four deny the charges against them.</p>
<p>The Sun secretly taped Grobbelaar, a Zimbabwean, talking to a former business partner, Chris Vincent, and then confronted him at London's Gatwick Airport in November 1994, filming that meeting, too.</p>
<p>The jury was shown a video of the Gatwick controntation, where Grobbelaar says: &quot;I have never tried to throw a game in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Grobbelaar is told that Vincent has accused him specifically of taking 40,000 pounds ($65,000) for throwing a game against Newcastle, and the soccer star in return suggests that Vincent is trying to get at him over a failed business venture.</p>
<p>&quot;I actually put in 55-60,000 pounds in a joint venture in Zimbabwe...He has never come up with any of the evidence of where the money has gone to,&quot; Grobbelaar says to the reporters.</p>
<p>He said the money had come from a fund established after a testimonial game at Liverpool.</p>
<p>The prosecution has said that police have found no evidence of any such transfer out of the fund.</p>
<p>Sun reporter John Troup told the court that notes taken at one meeting with Vincent had been lost. Lawyers acting for the defendants suggested the notes had been destroyed, but Troup denied this.</p>
<p>Prosecutor David Calvert Smith told another Sun journalist, Guy Patrick, that there seemed to be &quot;hanging in the air a suggestion you and others on the Sun newspaper have deliberately destroyed evidence&quot;.</p>
<p>Patrick denied this.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar is due to play for the Zimbabwean national team against Ghana in the African Nations' Cup on Sunday. He has been given permission by the court judge to travel to Harare for the game, Zimbabwean soccer officials said.</p>
