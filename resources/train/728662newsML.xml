<title>RUSSIA: Russian, Chechen security services sign treaty.</title>
<headline>Russian, Chechen security services sign treaty.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-07-15</dateline>

<p>The state security chiefs of Russia and its separatist Chechnya republic signed a provisional cooperation treaty on Tuesday, said a spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB).</p>
<p>The treaty, signed by FSB head Nikolai Kovalyov and his Chechen counterpart Abu Movsayev, calls for cooperation in fighting such acute problems for Russia's turbulent North Caucasus as kidnappings, terrorism and arms and drug trading.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the treaty had been signed in &quot;one of the towns in the North Caucasus&quot;. Itar-Tass news agency said the two men met in the spa town of Yessentuki in the Stavropol region which borders Chechnya.</p>
<p>Hostage-taking, including of foreigners, has become a huge problem in Chechnya, where Russian troops fought a bloody campaign against separatist forces for 21 months until last August. Two Britons, one Frenchman and a Slovak were kidnapped earlier this month in and around Chechnya.</p>
<p>Chechen authorities insist the region is independent from Russia despite a key peace deal signed with Moscow last year putting off the issue of sovereignty for five years.</p>
<p>In a sign of improving relations, Russian and Chechen officials signed a deal on Sunday detailing how they would repair a war-damaged oil pipeline that runs across Chechnya.</p>
<p>The pipeline is a vital conduit for Azeri oil from the Caspian Sea to world markets through Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.</p>
