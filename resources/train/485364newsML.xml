<p>Thousands of schoolchildren exposed to tainted strawberries in Michigan, Georgia and Los Angeles were inoculated against the hepatitis A virus on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 163 cases had been reported in southern Michigan and the number was expected to rise.</p>
<p>As concern mounted over the issue, federal officials were trying to determine how the strawberries became tainted and whether they came from Mexico. Suppliers must vouch that only U.S. products are used in school lunches.</p>
<p>Other government officials moved to allay concerns. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said disease-tainted food was a rarity in school lunch programs.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a rare incident,&quot; Glickman told reporters in Boston. &quot;Truthfully, school districts (and) health departments do a very good job of ensuring food safety. The food that comes in, by and large, is absolutely safe.</p>
<p>&quot;When you find a mistake, you get to the cause of it and ... if there's malfeasance involved you've got to take very aggressive action.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 2,200 children were inoculated in Michigan, while about 9,000 schoolchildren in Los Angeles and 2,000 in Georgia were receiving inoculations of immune globulin on Thursday. Shipments of the antidote also were being sent to Tennessee schools. The medicine is not a vaccine but contains antibodies that bolster resistance to the disease.</p>
<p>The disease, with flu-like symptoms, typically makes people feel sick for two to eight weeks but is rarely fatal. Hepatitis A, which is common in developing countries, is spread by poor personal hygiene or when food or water is contaminated by sewage.</p>
<p>CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said the number of hepatitis A cases probably would rise for the next few days. &quot;The only cases of actual disease are still in Michigan. We have consumption of suspected strawberries in other places but we do not have any disease.&quot; Reynolds told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Hepatitis cases will continue to trickle in (in Michigan). There's no doubt about that. The epidemiologists up there expect that as people become more aware of this they may begin to report. So they would expect a few more cases in the days to come,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>About 26 million children receive hot meals daily at 90,000 schools under the school lunch program, which costs the U.S. government several billion dollars a year. The program, run by the Agriculture Department, subsidizes the cost of meals to poor children and provides food donations.</p>
<p>Glickman said his department was working with FDA and CDC in the investigation. &quot;We buy food for the lunch program and want to make sure there are no additional problems with the food that we are purchasing and we are making sure that is the case ... We are also doing a review of the origin of these products,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The suspect strawberries came from San Diego processor Andrews &amp; Williamson and were shipped to six states, according to the Agriculture Department. The president of A&amp;W has resigned.</p>
<p>The supplier could be subject to criminal charges if it misrepresented the source of the strawberries.</p>
<p>In a related development, a Customs Service spokesman said a decsion was expected in the next two months on a proposal to require country-of-origin labels on the front panel of packages of frozen produce. At present, a country-of-origin stamp must appear somewhere on the package. U.S. growers and processors say the requirement is often ignored.</p>
