<p>Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato on Thursday said he wants his panel to act on a financial services reform measure that would allow banks to conduct up to 25 percent of their business in non- financial activities.</p>
<p>The measure, introduced by Rep. Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican, and Rep. Bruce Vento, a Minnesota Democrat, is a compromise to financial modernization proposals introduced by D'Amato and in the House by Rep. Richard Baker, which would impose virtually no limits on bank commerical activities.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the answer is we are first going to move the Roukema bill, which I think is very important so that the dual banking system is preserved,&quot; D'Amato, a New York Republican, told reporters.</p>
<p>The Roukema bill, backed by an alliance of financial service trade groups, would allow a bank to do up to 25 percent of its business in non-financial activities.</p>
<p>A measure introduced by House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, would allow only minimal combinations among banks and commercial firms.</p>
<p>D'Amato expressed doubts about Congress being able to pass his broader financial reform measure.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd love to see that take place, but the realities are can you get sufficient support?&quot; the lawmaker said. &quot;Many of major banking institutions who were supportive of that have now been less inclined to be supportive so I don't know whether that is something that can be accomplished.&quot;</p>
