<p>The Environmental Protection Agency, criticized for losing hundreds of confidential business documents submitted to it by chemical companies, said Friday it has improved its methods and only lost two such documents between April and June.</p>
<p>That compared with 106 documents that could not be accounted for from October 1995 to March 1996, before the agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances tightened up its document management, the agency said.</p>
<p>Between Ocotober 1993 and October 1995 the agency misplaced about 200 documents submitted to it by companies to provide information on their pesticides' and other chemical products' environmental and health effects.</p>
<p>The documents also contain confidential information on formulations of the chemical products, potentially imperiling a company's investment if the product information were made available to competitors.</p>
<p>The EPA said it was notifying 65 companies that it was unable to account for 106 documents filed between October 1995 and March 1996, and the two more filed after April.</p>
<p>In a statement, it said companies also were notified &quot;that there is no evidence that any unauthorized disclosure of data has occurred,&quot; and said no documents were known to have actually been released from the agency's secured storage area.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to hear that the agency is taking corrective action, but any loss of confidential business information is still a matter of real concern to our members,&quot; a spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still trying to figure out the consequences of the earlier losses,&quot; he said.</p>
