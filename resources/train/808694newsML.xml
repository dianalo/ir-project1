<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices mostly held steady again Tuesday in thin trade, with further gains in East Coast city gate gas quotes and stronger crude still underpinning the complex despite mild weather.</p>
<p>&quot;With gas prices this high, I don't see resid slipping much. Supplies are pretty thin and there are not a lot of incremental barrels,&quot; said one trader, noting high sulphur was tight and low sulphur was propped by strong gas quotes.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent was unchanged at $16.50-75 a barrel, with September one percent paper talked 25 cents higher at $16.50-65 with firmer crude.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour again eased slightly to the $18.25 area, on reports 75,000 barrels of HP for 8/23-27 delivery sold late Monday at $18, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York were steady, with 2.2 percent still talked in the low-$16s.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent notionally held at $16.50 but buyers seemed nervous after reports of a major offering barrels delivered into Florida at $16.50, a trader said.</p>
<p>USG three percent again was steady to up slightly in the $16.25 area, helped by a deal late Monday for about 50,000 barrels of prompt 2.8 percent at $16.65. The same quality material sold Friday at $16.</p>
<p>New York city gate gas prices gained a few cents Tuesday to about the $2.80/mmBtu level, or $17.64 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, firmed more than a nickel to the low-$2.60s/mmBtu, or about $16.51 a barrel.</p>
