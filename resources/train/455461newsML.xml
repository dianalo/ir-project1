<p>South African industrial shares should continue their recent rally next week, helped by recovery in selected sectors and optimism about the economic outlook, dealers and portfolio managers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But fears over a possible U.S. interest rate hike and a four-day week next week may dampen trade and reduce volumes traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Many players, already enjoying a long weekend this week due to Friday's public holiday, are likely to take leave over the Easter break.</p>
<p>Grahame Graham-Parker, general manager at Infinity Asset management, said he remained upbeat on industrials as buyers sought out value in key sectors, predicting the index would move towards the 8,700 level set last in January in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We see continued firming in industrials driven by the IT sector, construction, insurance, property, beverages, hotels and leisure, and the recovery in the stores sector continuing,&quot;    </p>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>The industrial index closed on Thursday at 8,322.6.</p>
<p>Other dealers said the March quarter reporting season for unit trusts would also boost sentiment.</p>
<p>However, concerns of a rate hike in the U.S. could cap demand as players await direction from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday on a possible interest rate hike.</p>
<p>And gold shares may struggle next week despite the recovery in the gold price.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold shares have seen another correction in a bear market in gold...the general trend is to remain down week-on-week,&quot; Graham-Parker said.</p>
<p>There are no major company results expected next week and the market will look for local guidance from February CPI figures due on Thursday.</p>
<p>CPI is expected to rise to 9.75 percent from 9.4 percent in January year-on-year. The month-on-month rate of increase is expected to slow to 0.45 percent after 1.3 percent in January.</p>
<p>The annual increase will be the highest in 20 months but economists are generally sanguine about the inflation outlook following the rand's strength so far in 1997. Most expect inflation to peak at around 10 percent in April or May.</p>
<p>A long-term survey of economists released by Reuters on Thursday also painted a broadly encouraging picture of the economy.</p>
<p>The consensus for South African real GDP gropwth in 1997 was 2.4 percent, down on the 3.1 percent recorded in 1996. But analysts noted this disguised a marked improvement in the non-farm sector which expanded just 1.9 percent in 1996 but should grow more than three percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Last year's growth was mainly due to exceptional rains and bumper crops rather than the performance of industry.</p>
