<p>One Russian Interior Ministry soldier was killed and five others were injured on Tuesday when their armoured personnel carrier hit a mine in Dagestan, an ethnic Russian region neighbouring rebel Chechnya.</p>
<p>Doctors told Reuters the soldier had died in hospital from his wounds. Earlier Itar-Tass news agency, quoting Russian military sources, had reported that all six soldiers had been killed in the blast.</p>
<p>The incident took place near the town of Khasavyurt, where Chechen rebels and Russia's security boss Alexander Lebed signed an accord last month aimed at ending the 21-month-old confict.</p>
<p>The truce accompanying the peace deal has generally held since then.</p>
<p>Russia reacted swiftly to Tuesday's explosion, which happened while the soldiers made a reconnaissance trip.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a crude provocation, aimed at the destabilisation of the atmosphere in the region,&quot; the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died in Chechnya since President Boris Yeltsin, now in hospital awaiting heart surgery, sent troops there in December 1994 to quell an independence bid.</p>
<p>Fighting almost stopped after Lebed's intervention but the Khasavyurt deals, which provided for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and postponement of a decision on the territory's future status, have not yet been fully implemented.</p>
<p>Under the accord, which also provided for the release of all prisoners held by both sides, six Russian soldiers were freed on Monday by their Chechen captors, Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tass described the situation in Chechnya as tough and said one Russian soldier had been killed there on Monday by a sniper.</p>
