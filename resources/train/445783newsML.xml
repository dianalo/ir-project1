<p>The Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said on Sunday he had ordered a study of U.S. impeachment procedures in case a &quot;smoking gun&quot; emerged in the fund-raising affair dogging President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>&quot;We are studying the laws of impeachment, the procedures of impeachment,&quot; Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican, said on the &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; television program.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;I would like to have some evidence -- I would like to have at least one smoking gun -- before we proceed with impeachment. That is a drastic, draconian remedy.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House declined comment on Hyde's statement.</p>
<p>Last week, Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, sought a Judiciary committee meeting to discuss whether improper fund-raising on behalf of President Clinton's reelection last year warranted impeachment proceedings.</p>
<p>Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the FBI warned key elements of the Clinton administration as early as 1995 about an alleged Chinese plan to use laundered funds to influence U.S. elections.</p>
<p>He said warnings went to the State Department, CIA, Justice Department, two Congressional committees and as many as seven lawmakers.</p>
<p>&quot;They knew that the Chinese government was going to come into this country in an attempt to purchase influence,&quot; but Democrats relied on fund-raisers with alleged ties to China nevertheless to fund the 1996 reelection, Hatch said on the CBS program &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Hatch's charge that the FBI raised an alarm in 1995 was &quot;contrary to what is being communicated to me.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the first FBI warning of which he was aware went to National Security Council staffers at a June 1996 meeting. Clinton complained last week that at the behest of the FBI agents involved, and for unexplained reasons, neither he nor his senior staff had been told of it. The FBI contradicted the president in a rare public dispute.</p>
<p>Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said Attorney General Janet Reno &quot;may be in a situation of dereliction&quot; for failure to appoint an independent counsel given what she may know from a Justice Department criminal investigation into the fund-raising matter.</p>
<p>Specter urged the opening of an investigation into any possible link between the alleged Chinese plan to buy influence with U.S. officeholders and Clinton's 1994 reversal on renewing Beijing's trade privileges.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I'm not saying that it's a bribery matter, but I'm saying that where you have that time sequence it ought to be investigated,&quot; he said on the ABC program &quot;This Week.&quot;</p>
<p>In reversing course on China in May 1994, Clinton dropped a threat to use trade as a lever to force Beijing to improve its human-rights record, a shift ardently backed by big U.S. business.</p>
<p>Hyde said that he asked his staff to prepare a couple of pages on the impeachment process. &quot;That doesn't mean that anything is imminent or it doesn't mean it isn't imminent. It means we want to be ready for whatever happens,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under Article 2, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, a president may be removed from office after conviction by the Senate of &quot;treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot;</p>
<p>If the House Judiciary Committee approved one or more articles of impeachment and the full House adopted them, a trial would be held on the charges with members of the Senate as the jury. A two-thirds majority of the 100 senators is needed to remove an impeached official.</p>
<p>The last time the impeachment process was used against a president was in 1974 when the Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon for the Watergate scandal. He resigned before the full House could vote on them.</p>
