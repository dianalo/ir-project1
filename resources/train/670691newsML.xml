<p>Voters in Georgia's Cobb County dealt a stunning defeat Tuesday to a one percent sales tax for school improvements, while sales tax increases and extensions passed in nine smaller Georgia counties.</p>
<p>By a vote of 18,820 to 14,204, Cobb County and Marietta voters became the first in the Atlanta metropolitan area to reject a sales tax for schools.</p>
<p>The proposal, which sparked a flurry of cable TV and local radio adds by an opposition group, would have increased the sales tax to 6 percent to raise an estimated $654 million for school construction, renovation, technology and bond debt relief.</p>
<p>Georgia voters approved a constutitional amendment in November allowing school districts to levy a one-percent sales tax for five years to fund construction and repay bond debt. The tax must also be approved locally by referendum.</p>
<p>Voters in six other counties approved the school tax in their elections Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Crisp County, the tax would raise $16.5 million and was approved 734 to 476.</p>
<p>In Dougherty County, the tax would raise $90.4 million and was approved 4,351 to 3,065.</p>
<p>In Hall County, the tax would raise $132.5 million and was approved 5,986 to 1,371.</p>
<p>In Lowndes County and Valdosta voters approved the tax 3,504 to 2,141. It will raise up to $89 million, to be split between the city and county schools.</p>
<p>In Peach County, the tax would raise $10 million and was approved 1,762 to 281.</p>
<p>In Worth County, the tax would raise $9.8 million and was approved 1,048 to 347.</p>
<p>Three counties also approved five-year extensions of their one-cent local option sales taxes for other projects.</p>
<p>In Bulloch County, the extension would raise $35 million for landfill, road and bridge projects and was approved 957 to 359.</p>
<p>In Chatham County, the tax would raise $230 million for drainage and road projects and was approved 10,770 to 9,912.</p>
<p>In Oglethorpe Couunty, the tax would raise about $3 million for roads and infrastructure projects and was approved 769 to 60.</p>
