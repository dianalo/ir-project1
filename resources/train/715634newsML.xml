<p>Hungary's seven parliamentary parties welcomed on Wednesday the invitation of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary into NATO and said they would agree soon on a national referendum on NATO membership.</p>
<p>Head of the junior government coalition partner the Free Democrat's group in parliament Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said government and opposition leaders would meet on Thursday to agree on a joint declaration welcoming the NATO decision, and on a planned referendum to accept the NATO invitation.</p>
<p>Speaking to a joint session of the defence and the foreign committees and diplomats from NATO member countries, he said the NATO invitation was a recognition of efforts by the three Central European states to integrate into the West.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's (NATO) summit recognised their efforts to build up democracies,&quot; he said. &quot;Countries, which earlier were the members of another alliance, have been invited,&quot; referring to the former Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>The representatives of all the seven parties reconfirmed their support for NATO membership at the session.</p>
<p>As a preparation for membership expected for 1999, Hungary should continue to modernise and strengthen civilian control over its army and also persuade its &quot;NATO-sceptics&quot; that the country's membership is necessary, they said.</p>
<p>Zsolt Nemeth of opposition party Fidesz-MPP said Hungary could join the NATO even without a referendum as all parties agree on the question, but Gyula Molnar of the senior ruling coalition Socialist party MSZP said the governemtn was committed to its election promise to hold the poll.</p>
<p>He added the referendum would be held by November at the latest.</p>
