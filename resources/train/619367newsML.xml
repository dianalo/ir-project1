<p>Pete Sampras feels cool at this year's French Open -- just like his rackets.</p>
<p>World number one Sampras, seeking to clinch the only grand slam title to elude him, has attracted attention by keeping his rackets in the ice box.</p>
<p>&quot;If I keep them out in the heat, the strings lose their tension,&quot; he explained after crushing Spaniard Francisco Clavet in straight sets to reach the third round on Wednesday. &quot;That's why I put them in the refrigerator.&quot;</p>
<p>His rackets might not like hot weather but the man certainly does as the sun makes the clay courts nice and fast, allowing him to play his trademark, attacking game.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mind what kind of surface I'm playing on,&quot; said Sampras, who has won grand slams on anything but clay. &quot;I know what my capabilities are and I know that if I play well, I'll be hard to beat.&quot;</p>
<p>Sampras may yet become the first man to win all four grand slams since Australian Rod Laver, the all-time great he admires most.</p>
<p>His best result in Paris came last year when he lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very pleasant to be back after what happened last year,&quot; he said after taming a helpless Clavet 6-1 6-2 6-2. &quot;I had mixed emotions last year because I had beaten very good clay court players such as (Spaniard Sergi) Bruguera but still I lost.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a question mark over Sampras's form before this year's tournament as his preparation was hampered by a thigh injury.</p>
<p>But a straightforward first round win over Frenchman Fabrice Santoro followed by a brilliant demonstration against clay court specialist Clavet shows he should be regarded as one of the favourites.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't play too good early in the clay court season and my preparation for the French Open was not what it should have been,&quot; he said. &quot;Coming here, I didn't know how sharp I would be but I'm confident now. I'm hitting the ball well, moving well on court and I'll be pretty hard to beat.&quot;</p>
<p>The fans packing the courts in Paris, where the weather has been beautiful, certainly would like Sampras to win as they feel he is more exciting to watch than Spain's legion of claycourt experts.</p>
<p>&quot;They know this is the one tournament I haven't won and they're behind me,&quot; said Sampras, looking forward to more sunny days and more refrigerators full of cold rackets.</p>
