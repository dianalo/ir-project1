<p>Specialty chemicals group Laporte Plc is expected to announce the beginnings of a recovery in profitability on Monday, analysts said on Friday, although its 1996 results will continue to be clouded by exceptional charges.</p>
<p>The company is expected to annouce pre-tax profit of between 114.3 and 124.0 million stg before exceptional charges, compared with 113.2 million stg in 1995.</p>
<p>However, the headline figure will again be reduced by exceptional charges, largely related to disposals, of around 63.0 million stg; an improvement on the 88.7 million stg charges made against the 1995 results.</p>
<p>The dividend is expected to rise modestly to between 23.5 pence and 24.0 pence from 23.0 pence in 1995. The group froze its dividend at the half-year stage.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's new management team, led by chief executive Jim Leng, achieved much of its restructuring goals last year, reshaping the group to focus on specialty chemicals and performance materials.</p>
<p>The group, which began 1996 with gearing of around 60 percent, is also expected to have virtually wiped out its debt following a series of disposals.</p>
<p>Analysts said there was room for further disposals, noting that the U.S. adhesives business could be in line to go after the sale of the European adhesives operations.</p>
<p>In December, Laporte announced the sale of its European adhesives and sealants activities to Elf Atochem of France for 100 million stg, which analysts said would result in a net exceptional charge of around 22 million stg.</p>
<p>&quot;The interesting thing is what they will do with their ungeared balance sheet,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>He said Laporte was likely to be seeking acquisitions in the area of electronic chemicals and specialty organic chemicals, supplying products to the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical industries.</p>
<p>Analysts will also be keen to see whether the group has moved closer to its goal of raising operating profit margins to mid-teen levels. Core divisions reported margins of 11.9 percent at the half-year stage.</p>
