<p>Striker Marcus Gayle earned Wimbledon an English League Cup quarter-final place for only the second time in their history with a first half goal which was enough to knock out last year's winners Aston Villa on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Villa, League Cup winners twice in the last three years, had dominated the first 45 minutes before Gayle turned the match around.</p>
<p>There looked no danger when he chased Alan Kimble's long ball a minute before the break but he held off the challenge by defender Steve Staunton to reach the by-line before flashing a left-foot shot between keeper Michael Oakes and his right-hand post.</p>
<p>Villa's misery was completed when England defender Gareth Southgate was stretchered away in the 82nd minute with what looked a serious knee injury.</p>
<p>In other League Cup fourth round matches, premier league Southampton were held 1-1 at first division Oxford while Ipswich won 1-0 at home against Gillingham.</p>
<p>But the headline-grabbing scoreline of the night came in an F.A. Cup first round replay where Hull striker Duane Darby scored six goals as the third division side beat non-league team Whitby 8-4 after extra time.</p>
<p>Darby scored three times in the first half  but the northern league team were leading 4-3 before Darby struck his fourth a minute before full time to force an extra 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The striker added two more in extra time as Hull finally registered a comfortable win.</p>
