<headline>Space guru Arthur C. Clarke hails moon ice find.</headline>
<dateline>COLOMBO 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>Space guru and author Arthur C. Clarke on Wednesday hailed the reported discovery of ice on the moon, saying it boosted the chances of establishing a permanently occupied moon base.</p>
<p>&quot;It's extremely important and it's quite plausible,&quot; Clarke told Reuters in the capital of this Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>He said the find made a permanently liveable moon base more likely -- ice can be used to provide water and oxygen -- but cautioned the discovery had not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>U.S. scientists said in Washington on Tuesday a U.S. military spacecraft had found what appeared to be &quot;a dirty, dirty lake&quot; of ice on the moon that could one day help support a permanent human space base there.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Department officials said the ice, found at the moon's south pole and which probably came from comets, could support a manned moon base for considerable time.</p>
<p>Clarke, 79, is the author of scores of novels and non-fiction books and creator of several documentaries and a long-time believer in the possibility of ice on the moon.</p>
<p>In 1954, 15 years before the first manned moon landing, he wrote: &quot;It is not impossible that traces of water and gas, frozen solid, may exist deep down in lunar crevasses where the rays of the sun never penetrate.&quot;</p>
<p>In the past half century, scores of Clarke's predictions have come true, including his then-controversial 1945 outline of a network of geo-stationary communications satellites.</p>
