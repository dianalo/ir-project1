<p>European envoy Franz Vranitzky arrived on an emergency mission to Albania on Thursday, saying time would tell if he could avert a fresh crisis in the country over new elections.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see, we will have to wait and see,&quot; a tight-lipped Vranitzky said when asked if he was optimistic he could make a breakthrough.</p>
<p>The elections are a key element in efforts to stop Albania sliding back into the violence of February and March, which erupted after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>But most parties are threatening to boycott the vote, planned for June 29, after the Democratic Party of President Sali Berisha forced an election law through parliament which opponents said favoured the Democrats.</p>
<p>Vranitzky arrived amid hopes that a crisis could be averted after Berisha on Wednesday postponed a decree to dissolve the parliament and call the elections.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, acting for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation (OSCE), is trying to get the elections back on track on his fifth visit since the violence broke out.</p>
<p>His previous trip was only last week when he brokered a political contract that was to set the scene for the polls.</p>
<p>Vranitzky will meet Prime Minister Bashkim Fino of the Socialist Party, who heads a national unity Government of Reconciliation of nine parties that Berisha was forced to install to stem the riots and disorder.</p>
<p>The envoy will also meet Berisha, Socialist Party leader Fatos Nano, the leader of Berisha's Democratic Party, Tritan Shehu, and smaller parties.</p>
