<p>United Parcel Service of America France is banking on a significant improvement in its financial situation by end-1997, but will report losses for last year above the 190 million francs recorded for 1995, UPS France spokeswoman, Sophie Tois, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The larger 1996 losses than in 1995 were mainly due to the cost of implementing a restructuring and redundancy programme. We cannot put a precise figure on it at this stage, but reports from industry sources of losses reaching 400 million French francs are an exaggeration,&quot; Tois said.</p>
<p>The 1995 loss figures were available in January 1996 and followed a shortfall of 110 million francs in 1994.</p>
<p>UPS France's 1996 turnover totalled 972.2 million francs compared to 1.09 billion francs in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is well on the road to recovery and our objective is to return to break-even point from December 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>She added UPS France was currently recording strong volume growth in its international express activities.</p>
<p>Separately, a senior UPS France executive -- who declined to be named -- said a number of middle ranking managers had left the company this year.</p>
<p>He told Reuters there was an &quot;on-going staff exodus&quot; and said it included the manager of UPS' Charles de Gaulle hub, Nathalie Colinot and the air operations manager for France, David Smith.</p>
<p>Three managers in marketing and sales, as well as managers working in handling, air engineering, human resources and road fleet operations, had also quit their jobs in recent months, he added.</p>
<p>UPS France's Human Resources director, Patrice Andre, confirmed that Colinot and Smith had left the company but he could not comment on the reason for their departure.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no 'exodus' of managers and staff turnover is at a naturally normal level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Colinot and Smith had been quickly replaced by internal appointments, Andre added.</p>
<p>The senior UPS executive said business had fallen sharply since UPS decided to pull out of palletised freight business in Europe, a move which coincided with heavy investment in an automated sorting hub in the Paris suburbs at Chilly-Mazarin.</p>
<p>Last year, UPS France unveiled a major restructuring plan involving 853 planned redundancies, including the transfer and regrading of 797 staff and closing 17 of its 55 French depots.</p>
<p>The company said it was refocusing its core business on international traffic for documents and small parcels distribution, but the move led to a series of strikes before a settlement was reached.</p>
<p>And earlier in 1997, staff at Chilly-Mazarin and at Rennes in western France staged a 48-hour strike over fears that UPS France was poised to close down its ad hoc transport and chartering activities. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+-5017</p>
