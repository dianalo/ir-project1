<p>Unocal Corp moved a step closer to leaving California's cutthroat refining and marketing business Tuesday by announcing it would give up ownership of downstream assets by year end.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said the move, the latest in a series of downstream divestments by Unocal, reflects intense competition in the West Coast market and as a desire by Unocal to focus its resources in more lucrative overseas markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Unocal no longer has any production in California...They're no synergies between refining and marketing and oil and gas production,&quot; said Bruce Lanni, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>76 Products Company, formed in 1994, will employ 3,100 people and hold about $2.7 billion in assets, including three refineries in California with a combined crude oil input capacity of 251,000 barrels per day. The unit will lease or own a chain of 1,200 service stations in six western states.</p>
<p>Among the options Unocal is considering for the downstream assets are an initial public offering, joint-venture, or sale.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing for implementing one of these options depends upon 76 Products' continued progress in developing sustainable earnings and cash flow,&quot; Roger Beach, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Unocal's move follows the April sale of its California crude oil and natural gas assets to Nuevo Energy Co for $492 million.</p>
<p>The announcement came as no surprise to Wall Street, which has watched the competition for California's downstream business intensify recently.</p>
<p>Analysts in mid-October reported a sharp 21-percent decline in West Coast refining margins in the early weeks of the fourth quarter, reflecting rising crude oil prices and falling prices for gasoline.</p>
<p>&quot;Industry-wide it hasn't been the rosiest business to be in,&quot; said Philip Tendler, an analyst for Schroder Wertheim &amp; Co.</p>
<p>By comparison, the percentage of Unocal's overseas crude oil production is expected to grow in the next year to around 60 percent of its total 220,000 barrel-per-day output from about 48 percent this year.</p>
<p>But while 76 Company will only say many changes are on the horizon, analysts see no refinery closures as a result of the spin-off.</p>
<p>&quot;It's impact on the overall California market should be negligible,&quot; Tendler said.</p>
