<headline>Kodak shares fall on report of flat Jan.-Feb. sales.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Eastman Kodak Co. stock fell sharply Friday after the giant photo products company said its January and February sales were essentially flat compared with the first two months of last year.</p>
<p>Kodak shares plunged $7.75, or about 9 percent, to $80.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.</p>
<p>The company said in a brief statement that it experienced modest unit volume growth in sales in the first two months of this year, but that was offset by lower prices and the negative impact of the strong dollar.</p>
<p>It added that growth rates in emerging markets moderated considerably in comparison with 1996.</p>
<p>The company did not provide specific figures and its officials were not available to comment.</p>
<p>Kodak also said, however, that the sales report would not have a significant impact on its operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Although 1997 has started more slowly than we expected, there is nothing in these first months which would cause us to change our fundamental operating plans and objectives,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Harry Kavetas said in the statement.</p>
