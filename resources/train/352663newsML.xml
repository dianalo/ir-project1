<p>A Hong Kong member of the Beijing-appointed caucus responsible for the transition of the British colony to Chinese rule offered a hint of compromise on Monday in the row over civil liberties in the territory.</p>
<p>The Beijing-selected Preparatory Committee responsible for re-imposing Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong voted on Saturday to roll back some of its laws, including part of the Bill of Rights, sparking a storm of protest.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect the Chief Executive and the provisional legislature to put in the (former) draconian laws,&quot; academic and Provisional Committee member Lau Sui-kai told Hong Kong radio on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect them to ... consult the Hong Kong people, otherwise both the Chief Executive's prestige and the chance of re-election of many provisional legislators will be harmed or seriously damaged.&quot;</p>
<p>The provisional legislature, which China will install in place of the elected chamber, a source of considerable controversy in Hong Kong, is expected to sit for about a year before new elections are called.</p>
<p>When future leader Tung Chee-hwa emerged from the meeting in Beijing which voted to strike down the legal clauses, he said he hoped the response in Hong Kong would not be &quot;too emotional&quot;.</p>
<p>He said he would consult with Hong Kong people before proceeding, but his promises fell on deaf ears in Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp.</p>
<p>&quot;Tung Chee-hwa's honeymoon with the Hong Kong people came to an abrupt end last week when he wasted no time in offering his unreserved support for the Chinese government's proposals to (water down the laws),&quot; said politician Emily Lau on Monday.</p>
<p>But Tung's promise of consultations raised a glimmer of hope in some quarters that he may manage to salvage a face-saving formula, the South China Morning Post said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;His flexible and pragmatic approach to quieting the controversy is to be hailed,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>By refraining from simply replacing the ordinances with their older and draconian colonial versions as he had initially indicated, Tung would alleviate many fears in Hong Kong, it said.</p>
<p>It urged him to consult all shades of opinion and draft fresh amendments acceptable to as wide a spectrum as possible.</p>
<p>Freedom of assembly in Hong Kong must be preserved in Hong Kong, the paper said, in line with the U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p>&quot;So it is to be hoped that by July 1 Mr Tung, after consultations with different sectors of society, will come up with new versions of the ordinances that will strike a balance between maintaining social order and preserving civil liberties,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony for more than 150 years, reverts to China at midnight on June 30, 1997, now 148 days away.</p>
<p>Many in Hong Kong fear Beijing's decision will lead to the gradual snuffing out of freedoms enjoyed in the freewheeling community of six million people despite promises to permit their capitalist life to continue unabated for 50 years.</p>
<p>A telephone poll conducted by an independent watchdog, the Hong Kong Policy Viewers, immediately after the vote on Saturday, found 55 percent of 573 respondents opposed the Provisional Legislature's plan and only 17.8 percent supported the move.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Democracy Party, the largest in Hong Kong, plans to present a protest petition of more than 10,000 signatures to Tung on Tuesday, deputy leader Yeung Sum told Reuters.</p>
