<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate dips at close after quiet trade.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate dips at close after quiet trade.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-12-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's overnight Cetes rate closed down 20 basis points on Thursday after a slow session in which liquidity predominated, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume was very thin, and dealers just made what trades they had to in order to leave early,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although changes were small, rates did tend to fall. The cutoff date (for banks settling checking acounts with the central bank) is out of the way, and with a lack of traders, rates will tend to fall further,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed unchanged at 29.00 percent.  </p>
<p>Banks had to settle balances outstanding with the central bank on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said they foresaw more sessions hallmarked by thin volume and light dealing until at least the New Year.</p>
<p>&quot;The forex market and the bourse are quiet, too. Every one has covered positions,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico offset liquidity shortfalls by auctioning four credits for a total of 5.408 billion pesos, which it assigned at rates of between 28.68 and 28.70 percent.</p>
<p>Total credit maturities for Friday were estimated at 6.235 billion pesos.</p>
