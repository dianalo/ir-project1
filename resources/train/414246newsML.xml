<p>With Britain's most important economic data for the week already out, gilts will fix their gaze across the Atlantic, searching for clues on the timing of the next U.S. interest rate rise.</p>
<p>The February UK purchasing managers' index (PMI) survey released on Monday painted a picture of moderate growth with continued signs of low inflation.</p>
<p>This should allow Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to obey his political instincts and leave interest rates unchanged at Wednesday's monetary meeting with the Bank of England, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no important domestic data so the market's attention will drift overseas. Gilts will be flat until later in the week,&quot; said Don Smith, UK economist at HSBC. &quot;But the market will remain very nervous ahead of the action in the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p>With no change expected in UK rates, the second part of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the House Banking Committee on Wednesday will be of particular importance.</p>
<p>Greenspan sent jitters through the markets during his first round testimony last week when he stirred up speculation of an interest rate rise by cautioning against inflation risks and buoyant equity markets.</p>
<p>&quot;He might use the occasion to qualify some of his previous remarks slightly and reassure markets if he thinks the reaction was overdone,&quot; said Philip Shaw, economist at Union Plc.</p>
<p>Equally crucial will be the U.S. jobs report due on Friday, the last major jobs data before the March 25 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Any surprises in non-farm payrolls, forecast to rise 230,000 in February, could send bond market investors running for cover, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-farm payrolls will have a very, very substantial impact on market expectations of a tightening,&quot; HSBC's Smith said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd need a very nasty number to force Greenspan's hand on March 25. Our impression is that he is talking tough, threatening to raise rates, but probably won't.&quot;</p>
<p>If Treasuries tumble on any surprises, other global bond markets will follow them lower, although gilts are likely to outperform on the way down, analysts said.</p>
<p>British data due this week include Thursday's February Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey of distributive trades, a key gauge of high street conditions, fourth quarter construction orders and January housing starts on Friday.</p>
<p>The February PMI dipped slightly to 53.5 from 53.9 in January, pointing to a mild easing in manufacturing growth. A figure of 50 is considered neutral.</p>
<p>The survey also showed domestic orders remained buoyant, but export orders grew only modestly as the strong pound made it more difficult for British firms to sell their goods abroad.</p>
<p>While no major surprises were expected on the political front following Labour's trouncing of the Conservative candidate in a local by-election last week, analysts said general election jitters would continue to hang over the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The City of London has a congenital anti-Labour bias, so at some point we're going to get a mini panic,&quot; Amstad said. &quot;Labour's macro framework looks fairly sound, but the election will tend to wear on the markets as we go forward,&quot;</p>
<p>The 10-year yield spread between gilts and Bunds, which ended last week at 180 basis points, may come under pressure as political nerves pick up, analysts said. But any widening should be seen a a good buying opportunity.</p>
<p>Britain must hold a general election by May 22.</p>
