<p>Italian shares closed mostly lower on Tuesday but above the day's lows after Wall Street's dive as U.S. investors reaped profits after a record-breaking run last week.</p>
<p>The blue chip Mib30 index closed 0.26 percent lower at 19,232 while the all-share Mibtel index finished 0.29 percent higher at 12,717.</p>
<p>The afternoon shakeout was across the board, sparing few stocks, although merchant banks Mediobanca and IMI were hard hit losing 2.05 percent to 9,980 lire and 2.42 percent to 15,400 lire respectively.</p>
<p>Cars group Fiat closed 0.65 percent lower at 6,100 lire after opening at a year's high of 9,185 lire on the back of yesterday's annual shareholders' assembly where the company confirmed a strong rise in turnover.</p>
<p>Energy giant ENI also closed lower, easing 0.29 percent to 9,217 lire. The stock goes ex-dividend on June 23.</p>
<p>Industrial holding group HPI was hit by a profit warning by sportswear maker Fila, in which it holds a controlling stake, which fell on Wall Street on Monday.</p>
<p>Among banks, Ambroveneto closed firmer, rising 0.52 percent to 4,470 lire, lifted by buying interest ahead of the bank's planned merger with savings bank Cariplo.</p>
