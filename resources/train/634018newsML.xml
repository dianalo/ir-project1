<p>The World Bank said on Tuesday it approved a package of $550 million in loans to help Romania overhaul its economy and fight poverty.</p>
<p>The three loans -- $50 million to help the poor, $350 million for agricultural reform and $150 million to improve Romania's highways -- mark the beginning of new World Bank effort to provide the nation with major financial support.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with the vigorous steps the government has taken in proceeding swiftly with market reforms after the uneven progress in recent years,&quot; World Bank official Kenneth Lay said in a statement.</p>
<p>Romania earlier this year launched an economic shock therapy programme after a centrist-coalition ousted leftists in 1996 elections. Under the programme, the country has tightened monetary policies, liberalised fuel, energy and food prices and adopted an austerity budget.</p>
<p>Noting that poverty in Romania has increased five-fold since 1989, the World Bank said its $50 million social protection loan was aimed at helping the poor through the introduction of soup kitchens and other measures.</p>
<p>The $350 million credit for agricultural reform will help speed up privatisation of that sector and increase rural employment and living standards, it added.</p>
<p>The Bank will also provide an additional $150 million to revitalise Romania's roads.</p>
<p>The Bank credits follow a standby loan from the International Monetary Fund of $430 million approved in April to back up Romania's reforms.</p>
<p>Both the IMF and World Bank suspended credits for Romania last year after complaining that the leftist government then in power had overshot spending targets.</p>
<p>The Bank credits will be provided at market-related interest rates and will be repayable in 20 years.</p>
