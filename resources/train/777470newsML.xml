<p>Philippine stocks settled with modest gains on Monday amid light trading as foreign investors continued to be sidelined by a dearth of positive news and the high interest rates scenario, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were in a tight range. People were just bargain-hunting on selective issues and those with short-term gains were selling,&quot; said Teresa Lee, vice-president at Asiamerit Securities.</p>
<p>The main index closed higher for the sixth consecutive session. It rose 3.89 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,639.53 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;The attention was just on selected stocks, on concept plays or those issues with stories to tell,&quot; said Fitz Aclan, assistant vice-president for domestic sales at Orion-Squire Capital.</p>
<p>Traders said secondary issues made gains during the session such as Belle Corp, SM Prime Holdings and Waterfront Philippines Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;Some punters were also playing on small floats,&quot; said Nathan Lozada, assistant vice-president at Paribas Asia Equity.</p>
<p>Turnover was light at 1.62 billion pesos, although improved from the previous session's 1.42 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;The volumes do not indicate a clear trend. I expect the market to be moving in a tight range unless we see higher-than-expected inflation figures for July,&quot; said Raul Ruiz, vice-president at Sun Hung Kai Securities.</p>
<p>Inflation figures are released on the fifth of each month.</p>
