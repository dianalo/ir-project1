<p>Jakarta stocks ended down for a third consecutive day on Friday on continued consolidation, particularly in blue chips, after earlier record gains, broker said.</p>
<p>The composite Index fell 5.74 points, or 0.79 percent, to close at 723.42 points after touching a low of 721.33 points. Losers led gainers by 72 to 48, with 67 counters unchanged. The index was off 13.18 points, or 1.80 percent, on the week.</p>
<p>Total volume was about 693 billion rupiah, with LippoLand and Telkom cross-traded on large volumes of 30.5 million and 16.5 million shares respectively.  </p>
<p>&quot;I believe the index was dragged down by a sharp correction in blue chip Telkom,&quot; a broker with a European securities firm said. Telkom carries the heaviest weight on the index.</p>
<p>He attributed the fall in Telkom to technical reasons as it had risen very sharply recently.</p>
<p>Another broker with Trimegah Securities predicted that profit-taking in Telkom this week would entice bargain hunters to buy back the issue next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Some blue chips such as Telkom, Semen Gresik and some banking stocks have reached bargain levels. There should be a rebound in the coming week,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the spillover effect of the de facto devaluation of the Philiphines peso to the Indonesian rupiah had caused some brief concern in the stock market in early trade, but when the rupiah stabilised, the stock market also stabilised.</p>
<p>&quot;The band-widening this afternoon seems to have strengthened the rupiah. I believe it will give positive sentiment to the stock market next week,&quot; the broker with the European firm said.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia, the central bank, on Friday widened its intervention band to 12 percent from eight percent.</p>
<p>Despite large profit-taking in many firstliners, blue chips toll operator Citra Marga and cement firm Indocement made gains in active buying, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Brokers said buying in Indocement was partly due to market speculation of possible corporate actions despite a company denial.</p>
<p>They also said profit-taking did not prevent speculative buying in medium and small-sized stocks.</p>
<p>Conglomerate Bakrie &amp; Brothers, Bakrie Sumatra Plantation and Bakrieland Development were among the target of buyers, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bakrie &amp; Brothers topped the active list with around 53 million shares traded, rising 50 rupiah to close at 1,375 rupiah on what brokers said was partly market talk of a possible private placement.</p>
