<headline>Publicis, True North settle row.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Advertising agency Publicis said in a statement it had settled all outstanding differences with its former U.S. ally True North and would develop under its own name a global network of agencies.</p>
<p>It added it would wholly own the Publicis FCB Europe joint venture.</p>
<p>Publicis will transfer to True North the FCB agencies in Paris, London, Lisbon and Athens where Publicis already has a strong presence. In return True North will transfer to Publicis &quot;a portion&quot; of its 49 percent stake in Publicis FCB Europe.  </p>
<p>The remaining stake will be converted to an increased True North shareholding in Publicis Communication, the advertising operating unit of Publicis SA.</p>
<p>The European network will take the name of Publicis Europe and will be wholly-owned by Publicis Communication in which Publicis will have a 73.5 percent stake -- against 79.2 percent previously -- and True North will have 26.5 percent instead of a previous 20.8 percent stake.</p>
<p>Publicis will maintain its 20 percent stake in True North and will be its largest shareholder. The two companies will continue to hold a seat on the other's board of directors.  </p>
<p>True North will also sell to Publicis its interest in the South African agency, The Partnership, and a majority interest in agencies either existing or to be spun-off from existing agencies in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, India and Thailand.</p>
<p>Publicis and FCB will enter into long-term service agreements to serve each other's clients in countries where the other does not yet have a presence.</p>
<p>The agencies have agreed to facilitate alignment of multinational clients within their respective agency networks in accordance with client wishes.</p>
<p>Publicis and True North will seek ways to cooperate on media-buying on a global basis and both companies will withdraw their respective legal claims against each other.</p>
