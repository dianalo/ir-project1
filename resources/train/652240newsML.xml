<headline>Dlr/yen off at US noon, Japan trade jitters focus.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-11</dateline>

<p>The dollar hovered at marginally weaker levels versus the yen at midday as traders feared Japan's whopping current account surplus could prompt more tough talk from Washington officials, experts said.</p>
<p>Potential friction between the United States and Japan on Japan's trade surplus could make the Clinton Administration reluctant to support a stronger dollar, said Elliott Dix, an assistant vice president at Signet Bank.</p>
<p>The market is anticipating that and buying yen, he added, thinking that is what the Administration would like to see.  </p>
<p>Japan's current account surplus ballooned 92.7 percent to 1.09 trillion yen in April from a year earlier. In merchandise trade alone, the surplus expanded 90.9 percent to 1.02 trillion yen from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p>Separately, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned that Japan should foster a demand-led recovery at home and avoid running up external surpluses that would hurt global growth.</p>
<p>During U.S. trading, the dollar repeatedly dipped below 111 yen, then rebounded to fetch 111.35/45 yen at midday, still slightly lower than 111.40/45 at the open.  </p>
<p>Traders, however, played down the dollar/yen rebound.</p>
<p>Bob Near, a vice president on the corporate desk at Bank of New York, said dollar/yen is trading &quot;very heavy&quot; even though it had what he termed a &quot;technical bounce.&quot;</p>
<p>Near also noted that &quot;there's a number of knock-out options that the market is talking about at 110.50 and at 110, (and) I think, we'll try to take (those) out as well.&quot;</p>
<p>In light of the way dollar/yen is currently trading, Near said the only thing that is going to keep the dollar from falling below 110 yen is either verbal or overt support from the Bank of Japan.  </p>
<p>Concern about the potential for further dollar/yen losses was also echoed by a trader at the New York branch of a major Japanese bank who cited talk of large stop loss sell orders at 110.50 and 110.</p>
<p>By contrast, dollar/yen's upside may prove difficult as the trader also noted talk of large dollar offers from U.S. funds around 111.40/50 yen.</p>
<p>The remarks from Summers were in a speech that focused on on the coming summit of the Group of Seven (G7) major industrial powers to be held in Denver, Colorado on June 20-22.  </p>
<p>Japan's trade surplus could prove a focal point for talks at the upcoming gathering in Denver.</p>
<p>Doug Lee, an assistant vice president at Sakura Bank Ltd, said, &quot;It used to be that when ever you went into a G7 summit, no one wanted to be short dollars. Now, no one wants to be short yen.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee added, &quot;If the surplus is a major concern..., they should be happy with the new direction in dollar/yen. But then again, they don't want it to come off too much.&quot;</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar changed hands at 1.7165/75 marks at noon, just below 1.7167/72 at the opening.  </p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.4365/75 Swiss francs from 1.4370/80 but rose to Canadian $1.3865/70 from C$1.3854/59.</p>
<p>The pound inched up to $1.6362/72 from $1.6360/70.</p>
