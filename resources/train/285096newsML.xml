<headline>LIFFE coffee futures hold losses by close.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>London robusta coffee futures were hardly moved in the afternoon and prices ended Friday mostly lower on early origin selling activity, traders said.</p>
<p>Benchmark March slipped on early New York's sell-off but met strong support at $1,225 a tonne, life-of-contract low. It closed $2 down on the day at $1,227.</p>
<p>But volume was a thin 2,633 lots, dominated by AAs on the March contract.</p>
<p>Spot January was $7 off at $1,250.</p>
<p>At the close of business on Thursday, the January uncovered positions dropped by 1,612 lots to 4,190 as players rolled forward their positions into nearby March.</p>
<p>The March/March arbitrage between New York and London stayed wide at 60 U.S. cents a lb and traders said the level could remain at 50-60 cents for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;People are pretty nervous of letting it go back below 50. A lot of people got their fingers burnt for going short of it,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Traders thought a further London slide could be slowed with the market in oversold condition and funds holding short positions.</p>
<p>In other news, Ugandan coffee sales jumped to 985,000 60-kg bags in December from 353,000 in November, spurred by the removal of a coffee tax and high level of beginning stocks.</p>
