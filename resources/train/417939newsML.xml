<headline>Wis. lawmaker calls for probe of former state aide.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Democratic state lawmaker in Wisconsin has asked the state's attorney general to investigate revelations that a former top aide to Gov. Tommy Thompson reportedly received at least $114,000 in consulting fees from Republican political organizations while on the state's payroll.</p>
<p>State Sen. Robert Wirch, D-Kenosha, called for a probe into possible ethics or campaign finance law violations, according to a statement from his office.</p>
<p>James Klauser, who was secretary of the state's Department of Administration from 1987 until he resigned last December, received some of the consulting money from a Republican National State Elections Committee fund that included contributions from several Wall Street firms between 1993 and 1996, according to a local newspaper report.</p>
<p>Those firms included Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co, which gave $30,000, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co, which gave $21,000, Lehman Brothers, which gave $20,000 and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co, which gave $5,000, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinal reported.</p>
<p>Wirch specifically singled out Bear Stearns, saying that the firm was selected as senior manager for a 1995 $160 million bond issue for a Milwaukee convention center backed by Wisconsin's moral obligation pledge.</p>
<p>Wirch said Bear Stearns's selection came after Klauser threatened to remove the state's backing for the issue unless the firm was picked.</p>
<p> Because Klauser oversaw much of the state's bond issuance, another lawmaker, State Rep. Spencer Black, D-Madison, has called for an audit of state bond issues to determine whether any of the contributing firm received &quot;preferential treatment&quot; when it came to the selection of underwriters.</p>
<p>    Black said he made his request to the Legislative Audit Bureau to look into the state's negotiated issues, which he added seemed to be the preferential way the state sells bonds rather than opening deals to competitive bidding.     In his state post, Klauser was in charge of the state's budget and bond issuance. He also served as a member of state boards, commissions and committees.</p>
<p>    Last September, Klauser resigned from his state position effective Dec. 6. He subsequently joined the law firm of Dewitt, Ross and Stevens in Madison.</p>
<p>    Klauser on Tuesday denied allegations of impropriety, claiming the charges were &quot;all political.&quot; He declined to verify any of the information contained in the newspaper reports.</p>
<p>    Spokesmen for Thompson were not available for comment.     Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin has called on U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson to include the situation with Klauser as part of the senator's probe into national campaign fundraising.</p>
