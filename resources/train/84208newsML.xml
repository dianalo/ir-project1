<p>The Czech Finance Ministry has reduced its forecasts for real growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to 4.8 percent in 1996 and to 5.0 percent in 1997, the daily Hospodarske Noviny said on Monday.</p>
<p>The centre-right Czech government is committed to a balanced budget in 1996 and 1997 and its previous, and also revised, estimates for this year and next were 5.1 percent and 5.4 percent respectively.</p>
<p>However, Hospodarske Noviny said Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik saw no need to revise nominal GDP estimates and, therefore, the budget proposals would not need to be changed.  </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's latest revision in its growth outlook coincides with a general decline in optimism about the Czech economy from analysts and ministers alike.</p>
<p>The country is running a growing trade deficit which Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy recently said could reach crisis proportions in 1997 if current trends continue.</p>
<p>Inflation, though low by regional standards, remains stuck at around nine percent and the government has been criticised by private analysts for failing to match substance to its free market rhetoric.</p>
