<p>Italian police said on Saturday they had smashed a major drugs smuggling ring, arresting six people and seizing 50 kg (100 lb) of heroin with a street value estimated at 40 billion lire ($25 million).</p>
<p>The police said they had arrested three Iranians, two of whom lived in Canada, and three Poles early on Saturday in Rome in an operation dubbed &quot;Overtrick&quot; and conducted by an anti-Mafia unit in conjunction with Canadian police.</p>
<p>The drugs were found hidden in the interior linings of several cars, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to pull this off thanks to undercover agents who were able to infiltrate the gang and win the confidence of the smugglers,&quot; Rome police chief Rodolfo Ronconi told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;To do this, they had to show the smugglers 14 billion lire ($9.2 million) in cash, kept in two suitcases,&quot; said Ronconi, adding that the undercover agents were Canadian.</p>
<p>He said the crime group bought the heroin in Turkey and smuggled it through former Yugoslavia, stopping sometimes in Italian territory.</p>
<p>Canadian police tracking the group asked their Italian counterparts for help after learning of the gang's stopovers in Italy, Ronconi said. ($1=1,527 lire)</p>
