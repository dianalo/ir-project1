<p>Russian shares reached new highs on Monday as worries about President Boris Yeltsin's health eased and investors gambled that the market would repeat last year's boom in 1997.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System (RTS) index of 24 leading shares closed at a new record of 262.34, after 251.07 at Friday's close and a previous closing high of 251.49 set on January 13. Turnover was a robust $44.9 million.</p>
<p>Dealers said news that President Boris Yeltsin, in hospital with pneumonia, was in a stable condition had supported prices for some days. But the main factor was the market's performance in 1996 and optimism that the boom would continue.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said later in the day that Yeltsin was leaving hospital on Monday.</p>
<p>The Washington-based International Financial Corp said this month that Russia was the best performing emerging stock market in 1996, giving a 155.9 percent return in dollar terms.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market is not looking at fundamental problems such as Yeltsin's health as much as before. It is driven by the weight of investment, by money,&quot; said Martin Diggle, director of Brunswick in Moscow.</p>
<p>Fund managers were enthusiastic about last year's performance and wanted to increase their stake in Russia, hoping the market would fare even better this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Many ended last year underweighted in Russia, and Russia finally ended up among the top performing markets. They expect Russia to be among these, if not the best, this year,&quot; he said. &quot;So they are buying, and supply is not too big.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was also reassured about the political situation in Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God, Yeltsin is alive and all attempts to remove him seem to be failing miserably. There is optimism on the market and there are fresh orders,&quot; said Oleg Tatkov of Renaissance Capital. &quot;Even the West is calm about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doctors say Yeltsin is all right in hospital. Everyone is optimistic and neither doctors nor journalists are scaring us with bad news,&quot; said Sergei Kosynkin, head of equities at Bank Menatep.</p>
<p>Some dealers said funds were flowing into share markets from the treasury bills market, where rouble yields have fallen to about 30 percent from around 40 percent two months ago.</p>
<p>But Tatkov said most money on the stock market was &quot;fresh&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The share market and the T-bill market are as separated as they have always been. What we've got here is a wave of new orders, new money from Russia and from abroad,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The market has been rallying since before Christmas and relatively low liquidity has put sharp upward pressure on share prices. The RTS index closed at 186.94 on December 23.</p>
<p>Leading shares have risen two to three percent since Friday and some second-tier oil companies made stronger gains as investors and operators searched for undervalued shares.</p>
<p>Second tier shares showed the strongest growth for the day, following a slowdown in rises among leading shares.</p>
<p>Operators said investors had begun to look away from the most liquid stocks to find relatively undervalued bargains.</p>
<p>St Petersburg International Telephone jumped to $2.75 at the close from $2.35 on Friday and Gazprom rose to $0.490 from $0.409.</p>
<p>LUKoil rose to $14.23 from $13.62, Norilsk Nickel to $6.28 from $5.95 and UES jumped to $0.1520 from $0.1385.</p>
