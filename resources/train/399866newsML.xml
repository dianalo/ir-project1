<p>German commercial television network ProSieben Media AG on Monday published details of its planned share listing, which will give the family of Bavarian mogul Leo Kirch control of the company.</p>
<p>ProSieben planned to sell five million new shares in July with a nominal value of five marks ($2.98) each and convert the stakes of existing owners into shares, giving the company a total of 17.5 million common shares and 17.5 million preferred shares.</p>
<p>All preferred shares would be sold to the public, but in the end 60 percent of common shares would be in the hands of Thomas Kirch, the son of Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch, who now holds 24.5 percent of common stock and 49 percent of the company's participation certificates.</p>
<p>The other 40 percent of common shares would belong to retailer Rewe AG.</p>
<p>Since only the common stock have voting rights, Kirch would have effective control over the company.</p>
<p>The sale of shares with a face value of 25 million marks would increase the group's capital to 175 million marks and put well over 20 percent of the company in public hands, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;By increasing capital and entering the market, several hundred million marks would flow to ProSieben Media AG,&quot; said Chief Executive Georg Kofler in a statement.</p>
<p>The issue would net &quot;one billion marks plus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ProSieben expected to show double-digit growth of sales and profit when it reports 1996 results this week. In 1995, group sales totalled 1.47 billion marks and pre-tax profit 111.4 million marks.</p>
