<headline>BIRMINGHAM MIDSHIRES SAYS MEMBERS TO GET 600 STG.</headline>

<p>British building society Birmingham Midshires said on Wednesday its qualifying members would receive an average windfall of 600 stg as a result of the society's takeover by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.</p>
<p>Birmingham Midshires' chief executive Mike Jackson told Reuters the mutually-owned society had around a million members who would qualify for a share of the 605-630 million stg Royal Bank has said it will pay, with an average payout of 600 stg.  </p>
<p>Birmingham Midshires members are likely to be offered Royal Bank of Scotland preference shares, with cash payments to some.</p>
<p>Birmingham Midshires is the fifth largest of Britain's building societies -- the country's traditional home loan providers -- with 115 branches.</p>
<p>Jackson said he believed the society's members -- its savers and borrowers -- would be &quot;delighted&quot; by the deal, which he said had been struck at a price he was comfortable with and was fair to all parties.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a good deal for our members, staff and customers,&quot; Jackson said.</p>
<p>The process of selling the 150-year-old society had, Jackson said, begun two years ago, when it had been decided to look at the best options for it.  </p>
<p>Royal Bank had approached the society about nine months ago, just as Birmingham Midshires itself had decided it would make an approach to the bank, having decided it would make a good partner.</p>
<p>Jackson said Birmingham Midshires would learn from the problems over allocating payouts to members encountered by other former building societies which have shed their mutual tradition and either been taken over or floated on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>So far this year Alliance &amp; Leicester, Halifax and Woolwich have all been floated on the stock market, with Northern Rock due to follow soon.</p>
<p>Birmingham Midshires is following a route blazed by Bristol and West, which was bought by Bank of Ireland in a deal valuing the society at 600 million stg.</p>
<p>The only job cuts at Birmingham Midshires will come from the closure of its mortgage processing centure in Bracknell. This decision had been made prior to the Royal Bank deal being struck and would lead to &quot;just under 300&quot; job cuts, Jackson said.</p>
