<title>LEBANON: Bank shares end week up, Solidere mixed.</title>
<headline>Bank shares end week up, Solidere mixed.</headline>
<dateline>BEIRUT 1997-03-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bank shares rose on sharply increased turnover on the Beirut Stock Exchange in the week ended on Friday and dealers said Banque Audi would maintain its upward trend.</p>
<p>Turnover in Solidere A more than doubled but the share dipped to an alltime low of $10.25 on Monday and stayed there throughout the week. The share stood at $10.35 last Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the A shares -- distributed to former holders of property rights in central Beirut -- were trading at even lower prices on the grey market.</p>
<p>The BLOM stock index fell 0.75 percent on the week to 896.53 while the LISPI share index rose 0.38 percent to 81.88.</p>
<p>Banque Audi, which has performed strongly since its January 20 debut, closed at $18 from last week's $17. It jumped from $17.25 to $18 on Tuesday on turnover of 110,400 shares and maintained the same price for the week.</p>
<p>Weekly turnover in Banque Audi rose to 216,827 from 81,461. Another 30,300 shares were traded in blocks off the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;A single company is heavily speculating, pushing the Banque Audi price upwards. Audi on the other hand wants to maintain a slow but steady upward trend. The coming period will test the strength of the financial muscles of each party,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The other listed bank, Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce, rose slightly to $12.875 from $12.625 in turnover of 51,748 from 42,960 last week.</p>
<p>The market's total weekly turnover doubled to 886,507 from 407,075 and value also jumped to $10,829,026 from $4,832,337.</p>
<p>A dealer, who wished not to be identified, said Solidere A shares were trading off the bourse at $9 to $9.5 outside the bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;Shares have been trading out on the grey market for some time now. Many people -- driven by need for cash -- sell their shares at lower prices off the bourse. If they put them on the BSE, they know they might have to wait one or two months before someone buys them,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>A total of 498,686 A shares were traded compared to 219,576 a week earlier. Total offer of shares was slightly above last week's 13 million shares supply.</p>
<p>B shares, issued in a $650-million subscription in January 1994, held steady at $10.75.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is being created for B shares through block orders placed on the $10.75 price, stabilising the share and hence preventing the A share from dipping further,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Also traded were 1,000 Ciments Libanais shares at $1.15625, slightly down from $1.1875 last week.</p>
<p>There was no trade in the three other listed firms: Uniceramic, Eternit shares and Ciments Blancs.</p>
