<headline>Camdessus says dollar in credible zone.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-08</dateline>

<p>International Monetary Fund head Michel Camdessus said on Tuesday the dollar was in a credible zone against European currencies and the yen.</p>
<p>He also said last month's quarter-point U.S. interest rate rise had contributed to stability but said he could not comment when asked about prospects about another rise.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a credible zone for the dollar against European currencies and against the yen,&quot; he told reporters after meeting French President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>He had been asked whether he was worried about the recent rise in the dollar, trading on Tuesday morning around 1.7140 marks and 126.30 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in the dollar for nearly two years has been no more than a correction in the trend which was really needed and which brought the major currencies into credible zones in relation to the intrinsic strength of each country and position of each of them in the economic cycle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States had managed its monetary policy well.</p>
<p>&quot;Through the way in which they manage their monetary policy, the Americans are contributing more to stability than to instability,&quot; he said, citing the way in which the U.S. rate rise was anticipated and well received by financial markets.</p>
<p>He had discussed the U.S. economy and rate rise with Chirac, in talks which reviewed preparations for a summit of the Group of Seven nations in Denver in June.</p>
<p>&quot;I told him that the measures taken by the Federal Reserve, the way in which they were announced and in which all this was managed was rather reassuring,&quot; he said.</p>
