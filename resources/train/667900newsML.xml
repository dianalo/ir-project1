<p>In a move that could have lasting consequences in world affairs, the European Union failed on Tuesday to take major steps towards building a common foreign and defence policy.</p>
<p>The 15 leaders, drafting a new Union treaty for the 21st century, could only agree on appointing a little-known Eurocrat to represent the EU in foreign policy and made no significant move towards taking charge of their joint defence.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the meagre result set to emerge from the EU's Amsterdam summit could reinforce the United States' pre-eminence in European security for years to come.</p>
<p>France and Germany, which had declared last year that Europe must have a single face and voice to run a credible foreign policy, settled in the end for making it a part-time job for the secretary-general of the EU's council of ministers.</p>
<p>That civil servant, who heads the policy-making council's Brussels secretariat, is currently a German named Juergen Trumpf, a former troubleshooter for Chancellor Helmut Kohl unknown to the public.</p>
<p>French officials who had insisted as late as Tuesday morning that the solution of making the council secretary-general into &quot;Monsieur PESC&quot; (Mr Common Foreign Policy), climbed down, saying the Dutch presidency's compromise proposal met France's needs.</p>
<p>They said Trumpf was nearing retirement and a higher-profile political figure might succeed him. But there was no sign that other countries, reluctant to see their own foreign ministers overshadowed, would necessarily agree to that.</p>
<p>The &quot;secretary-general/high representative for common foreign and security policy&quot; will assist the country holding the EU's rotating presidency in diplomacy and head a Brussels policy analysis and planning unit to improve crisis response.</p>
<p>Faced with dogged opposition from Britain and former neutral states to the EU becoming a defence organisation, the leaders were unable to agree to integrate the Western European Union (WEU) defence group into the Union.</p>
<p>Instead, they were set to decide the 10-nation WEU would remain an independent body, sub-contracted to carry out humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management missions for the Union &quot;including peacemaking&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea of eventually merging the WEU into the Union was watered down to such an extent that even Britain's staunchly Atlanticist government was set to accept the wording.</p>
<p>The Dutch compromise said that closer relations between the two bodies &quot;might in time lead to the integration of the WEU into the Union&quot;.</p>
<p>An aide to British Prime Minister Tony Blair told reporters: &quot;He is not going to allow anything to go through which he believes could be interpreted as undermining NATO.&quot;</p>
<p>He quoted Blair as saying Britain was perfectly happy for closer cooperation with the WEU but Europe was not improved by integrating defence and foreign policy.</p>
<p>While Britain's main concern was not to weaken the American security guarantee for Europe, Ireland and three other neutral states which joined the EU in 1995 -- Sweden, Finland and Austria -- were wary about Europe becoming a military power.</p>
<p>Nordic countries were also concerned that getting the EU into defence could complicate the Baltic repubics' bids for membership by raising Russian objections.</p>
<p>Swedish chief negotiator Gunnar Lund said: &quot;We object to the basic idea of enshrining into the treaty a clear-cut objective to integrate the EU and the WEU. We don't want to see that. We find that unacceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;If this were done, it would unnecessarily complicate the (EU) enlargement process. It will accentuate divisions rather than unity within the EU in this particular area,&quot; he said.</p>
