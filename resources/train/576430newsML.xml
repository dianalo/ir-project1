<headline>Former U.S. soldier gets life in race killings.</headline>
<dateline>WILMINGTON, N.C. 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>A white former U.S. Army paratrooper convicted in the racially motivated killings of a black couple was sentenced Monday to two life prison terms without parole.</p>
<p>North Carolina Superior Court Judge Coy Brewer imposed the two life sentences on Malcolm Wright after a jury recommended he be given life in prison instead of the death penalty for the murder of Jackie Burden and Michael James on Dec. 7, 1995.  </p>
<p>On May 2, Wright was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the shooting deaths of Burden and James as part of an initiation ritual for a white supremacist group at Fort Bragg.</p>
<p>The jury made its recommendation after a short deliberation. Earlier, Brewer had released three alternate jurors, all women.</p>
<p>One of them, Patricia Gilligan, a Wilmington teacher, commented on how difficult it was to serve during such a trial. &quot;We are jurors, being put in this position, to sit in judgment in something so horrendous was extremely stressful. We just could not believe that somebody was capable of such a thing,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Wright, 22, of Lexington, Kentucky, was charged along with fellow soldier James Burmeister, 21. Burmeister was convicted and sentenced to life in prison earlier this year after a jury deadlocked 11-1 in favour of executing him.</p>
