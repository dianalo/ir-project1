<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch bonds closed lower on Monday in sluggish trade as London was on holiday.</p>
<p>Most trade appeared in the middle segment and the July 1998. Dealers were mixed on the direction of the market as some saw opportunities to buy cheaply at current levels, but others remained bearish.</p>
<p>&quot;Last Friday's U.S. (durable goods) data caused commotion in the market,&quot; said one dealer, adding the market was in heavy weather technically. &quot;The 10-year bid yield could rise to 6.45,&quot; he said. The January 2006 bond was down 0.22 at 97.76/84, with a bid yield of 6.32 percent.  </p>
<p>Today's U.S. home sales data were in line with expectations and had a minor effect.</p>
<p>The July 1998 bond dipped 0.01 to 104.18/26, with a bid yield of 3.89 percent.</p>
<p>The long Dutch 2023 shed 0.44 to 106.45/65, with a bid yield of 6.96 percent or 18 basis points below the 2024 bund versus -19 at Friday's close.</p>
