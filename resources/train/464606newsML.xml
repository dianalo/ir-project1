<p>Blue Circle Industries Plc said on Monday it expected continued improvement in its heating division and a steady performance from heavy building materials after reporting in-line 1996 profits.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 1996 were 297.6 million stg versus 272.8 million pounds in 1995 after accounting for a one-off net hit of nine million the previous year. Total sales grew to 1.81 billion pounds against 1.77 billion, with the year dividend at 13.25 percent versus 12.5 pence.  </p>
<p>Keith Orrell-Jones, group chief executive, said of the outlook: &quot;This year we expect the heating improvement to continue and steady progress in the existing heavy building materials businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the recently clinched 164 million pounds ($263 million) deal to buy St Marys Cement Corporation of Canada would increase its earnings per share in 1997 and that the group was committed to expanding that side of the business further, with investment in the Philippines as a first step.</p>
<p>On the results performance, the chief executive said: &quot;Blue Circle performed very well in 1996 despite difficult trading conditions in the UK and mainland Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>He cited heavy building materials in the U.S. and Malaysia in particular and added that the heating division had completed the firt phase of its restructuring and more than doubled profits.</p>
<p>Looking at a divisional breakdown, heavy building materials profits were 244.3 million versus 241.5 million. The heating unit profits jumped to 35 million from 17.1 million, but bathroom profits fell to 24.6 million from 27 million. ($ = 0.623 British Pounds)</p>
