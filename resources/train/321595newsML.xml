<title>USA: Lockheed Martin posts higher profits due to Loral.</title>
<headline>Lockheed Martin posts higher profits due to Loral.</headline>
<dateline>BETHESDA, Md.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lockheed Martin Tuesday reported higher fourth quarter and full-year profits, following a series of lucrative contracts and the acquisition of Loral Corp. businesses last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales increases for the fourth quarter and year 1996 are primarily attributable to Lockheed Martin's strategic combination with the defence electronics and system integration businesses of Loral Corp., which was completed in April 1996,&quot; Lockheed Martin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin completed its $9.1 billion acquisition of the defence electronics and systems integration businesses of Loral Corp. last year. Lockheed estimated that the consolidation will drive annual savings to $2.6 billion by 1999.</p>
<p>The aerospace giant, formed through the merger of the former Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta, had fourth quarter earnings of $465 million, or $2.40 a share, on revenues of $7.7 billion. A year earlier it earned $311 million, or $1.56 a share, on revenues of $6.05 billion.</p>
<p>For the year, Lockheed earned $1.35 billion, or $6.80 a share, on revenues of $26.87 billion. In 1995, Lockheed earned $652 million, or $3.28 a share, on revenues of $22.85 billion.</p>
<p>The company said its backlog at year end was $50 billion, up from $41 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Lockheed had &quot;an unprecedented&quot; series of critical contract wins in 1996, along with strong financial performance and significant savings achieved through consolidation initiatives, said Norman Augustine, Lockheed Martin's chairman.</p>
<p>NASA chose Lockheed Martin to build and demonstrate the prototype X-33 single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle that eventually will replace the Space Shuttle. The program's first phase is valued at $1 billion.</p>
<p>NASA also awarded its Space Flight Operations Contract to United Space Alliance (USA), a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing Corp. The contract, valued at $7 billion over six years, makes United Space the single prime contractor for Space Shuttle operations.</p>
<p>Lockheed stock was down $1.125 at $88.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
