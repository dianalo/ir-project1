<text>
<p>August Brent crude futures were untraded at midday Tuesday, but levels were slightly lower from London's closing prices.</p>
<p>August Brent on SIMEX was quoted $18.65/18.78 per barrel, after London settled 29 cents higher at $18.80.</p>
<p>There was little discussion in Asia, brokers said.</p>
<p>IPE Brent had closed higher on bullish expectations of the American Petroleum Institute (API) figures.</p>
<p>The API figures, released in U.S. late Tuesday saw a drawdown in crude stocks of 4.36 million barrels.  </p>
<p>But the rise in heating oil stocks mitigated the bullishness of the crude drawdown, brokers said.</p>
<p>NYMEX last traded at $20.04, down eight cents from New York, where the contract had gained 32 censt to settle at 20.12.</p>
<p>August Brent was last traded at $18.55 per barrel, just</p>
<p>four cents higher than London.</p>
<p>London gapped higher to leave chart-gap support between $18.24 and $18.27. It closed near the highs of the day which has encouraged some follow through buying, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYMEX crudes were lightly traded during ACCESS in Asia, with just a handful of lots changing hands. August was last traded at $19.81, up one cent from New York.</p>
