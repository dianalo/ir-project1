<p>British engineering giant GKN Plc posted strong 1996 profits on Thursday and predicted a good year ahead even though it faced stagnant auto markets and a pending U.S. legal payout while sterling strength threatened to take a bite out of 1997 operating profits.</p>
<p>The results excluded any provision related to GKN's legal battle in the United States with its franchising operation, Meineke Discount Muffler Shope Inc, since no judgement had been made yet, the company said.</p>
<p>GKN Chief Executive CK Chow told Reuters the British currency's relentless rise over other European currencies could knock up to 18 million pounds ($29 million) off 1997 operating profit.</p>
<p>&quot;Every one percent (upward) move by sterling against the European currencies means 1.5 million (pounds) off operating profits for GKN,&quot; he said, adding that the hit on 1996 operating profits was 5.2 million.</p>
<p>Turning to 1996 results, pretax profits were 362.8 million pounds, up from 322.4 million and slightly below the average analyst forecast of 367 million. Sales were 3.32 billion versus 3.01 billion in 1995 and the total dividend payout was up 10 percent at 26.5 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;In trading terms, 1996 was another record year. All our core businesses made good progress with particularly strong performances from Chep and aerospace and special vehicles,&quot; Chow said.</p>
<p>On the business outlook for 1997, GKN said that automotive markets in Europe and North America were set to remain flat, but he still expected a better performance in the group's auto division.</p>
<p>Progress was expected through a mix of productivity growth, new product launches and gains in emerging markets in places like Poland, China and Korea.</p>
<p>The productivity gains are expected to come from Italy and the U.S., where GKN has mounted turnaround operations.</p>
<p>The aerospace and defence division was not expected to suffer from the completion of a major Warrior armoured vehicle contract later this year, but it would hit in 1998.</p>
<p>There are a series of product launches planned by the industrial services division but their impact on sales is not expected to register before 1998, Chow said.</p>
<p>GKN said it would appeal if it is ordered to pay damages to Meineke Discount. In February, GKN said the award would be 30 percent lower than the $740 million originally estimated.</p>
<p>In December, GKN was convicted by a jury in North Carolina of defrauding 2,500 franchisees of its specialist exhaust retailer Meineke.</p>
<p>GKN's cash reserves are 528 million pounds, enough to pay for the damages to Meineke and fund any acquisition or joint venture opportunities which may arise, Chow said.</p>
<p>Possible &quot;growth platforms&quot; for deals were aerospace structures and components and agri-technical construction and vehicle components, he said.</p>
<p>GKN's shares were up 20 pence at 975-1/2 by 1130 GMT, in line with a sharply higher market which was fuelled by a strong overnight surge on Wall Street. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)</p>
