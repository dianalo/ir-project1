<text>
<p>Citing the stock market's recent decline, the ranking Democratic member of the House Commerce Committee asked Treaury Secretary Robert Rubin on Monday for an update on measures to deal with emergencies.</p>
<p>Democratic Congressman John Dingell of Michigan noted that Rubin was chairman of the so-called Working Group that also includes chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission set up in 1988.  </p>
<p>The Working Group was to report to Congress through 1995 on efforts to coordinate regulation and protect the integrity and competitiveness of financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;In light of current market conditions, I respectfully request that Working Group advise us...as to the adequacy and effectiveness of mechanisms within and across marketplaces to protect the payments and market systems during market emergencies,&quot; Dingell wrote in a letter to Rubin.</p>
<p>He added that he considered the matter of &quot;utmost importance.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said his request was prompted by a nearly eight percent decline in stock market values in less than four weeks and by the &quot;increased levels of intraday volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>Dingell also asked Rubin to state whether or not the Working Group still regarded it as important to get better accounting and disclosure requirements in place for derivatives that trade on exchanges and in over-the-counter markets.</p>
