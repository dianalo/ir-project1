<p>A Turkish leftist leader held talks with other opposition party chiefs on Tuesday to discuss alternatives to the fragile ruling coalition of Islamists and conservatives.</p>
<p>Bulent Ecevit, head of the Democratic Left Party (DSP), called the meetings as a row between the ruling Islamists and the powerful military threatened the future of the alliance.</p>
<p>After meeting Ecevit, main opposition Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz issued a call to all parties apart from the Islamist Welfare Party to consider forming a new government.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement which I have reached with Ecevit is an agreement directed to all parties excluding the Welfare Party,&quot; Yilmaz told reporters. &quot;An open call is made to every party agreeing with a government formula based on these principles.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecevit also met Deniz Baykal, leader of the rival leftist Republican People's Party.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking about possible alternatives but we first have to get rid of this government,&quot; Baykal said after the talks.</p>
<p>Cooperation between the secularist parties has often been badly hindered by bitter political and personal rivalries.</p>
<p>Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan told members of his party on Tuesday that he was prepared for new elections at any moment. But he added there was no alternative to his 10-month-old coalition with the conservatives of Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, formed a coalition with the conservative True Path Party (DYP) last June after alliance talks between secularist parties failed.</p>
<p>DYP leader Tansu Ciller has so far stood by Erbakan, but his Welfare Party has made clear it was not prepared to go along with some military demands aimed at curbing a rise in Islamist activism since he came to power.</p>
<p>Two ministers from Ciller's party resigned at the weekend in anger at Erbakan's failure to respond to the military demands.</p>
