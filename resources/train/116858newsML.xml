<p>Brazil's new deficit-cutting plan may seem overly ambitious and politically motivated, but analysts said its central message -- a growing official concern over the nation's fiscal health -- should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>&quot;This response suggests that they believe the fiscal situation is not behaving as well as they were assuming, so they have to do something relatively fast,&quot; said Tomas Malaga, economist at Unibanco bank in Brazil.  </p>
<p>Analysts say undisciplined government spending is the chief threat to Brazil's economic stabilization drive, which has lowered monthly inflation to under 1.0 percent from 50 percent over the past two years.     The 40-point package announced on Friday aims to slash 200,000 jobs, boost tax revenue and sell state assets in a bid to cut 6.5 billion reais ($6.34 billion) from next year's books.</p>
<p>Economists question how much the government will actually achieve, noting it is overshooting many targets to shine a brighter light on President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who has his eye on re-election.</p>
<p>But they said the plan sends a strong signal that the government -- long accused of doing too little on the deficit-cutting front -- is disappointed with its fiscal track record.</p>
<p>They added that the measures, although long overdue, were positive and could serve as a stopgap measure to slow spending while more far-reaching reforms sit idle in Congress.  </p>
<p>&quot;This package is laudable and should have been attempted much sooner,&quot; ING Bank in Brazil said in a report.</p>
<p>In announcing the pact, Finance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged for the first time that Brazil's operational deficit in 1996 would likely end at about 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, a full percentage point higher than the original target.</p>
<p>Malan also said the pact was designed to achieve a 2.5 percent of GDP operational deficit in 1997.</p>
<p>Brazil's record on the fiscal front over the past two years has been spotty.  </p>
<p>The country shocked markets early this year when it announced a whopping 5.0 percent operational deficit in 1995, following expectations of 4.0 percent. By mid-year, its pledge to bring the 1996 deficit down to 2.5 percent had been dismissed by most private economists.</p>
<p>Much of the trouble has come from high interest payments on a mounting stockpile of internal debt. And although interest rates are in steady decline, talk of a 2.5 percent of GDP operational deficit in 1997 looks questionable to many economists.  </p>
<p>&quot;The fiscal outlook is delicate,&quot; said Mauro Schneider, chief economist for ING Bank in Brazil. &quot;Even though interest rates are falling,  the domestic debt stock is growing so it almost cancels out,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Economists said increasing revenue from privatizations and taxes next year would help Brazil's fiscal accounts. But they said progress on the fiscal front, whether it be through sweeping constitutional reforms or unilateral action by Cardoso, would remain slow.</p>
<p>&quot;In Brazil, things don't improve or worsen quickly. Everything goes slowly,&quot; Schneider said.</p>
