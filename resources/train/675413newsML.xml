<p>Olainfarm showed the biggest turnover of 11,000 lats. Its price seems to have stabilsed as it closed at 2.55 lats.</p>
<p>&quot;Olainfarm has stabilised somewhat close to 2.50 lats, although fluctuation in a range to 2.10 lats is possible,&quot; said Andreta Petersone, a dealer with Hansabank-Latvija.  </p>
<p>Kaija cannery, an official list stock, maintained its slow upward movement, adding one santime to 2.15 lats on turnover of 6,815 lats.</p>
