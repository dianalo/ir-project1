<p>Syrian President Hafez al-Assad said on Tuesday he could see no hope for Middle East peace despite an apparent revival of diplomatic activity after Israel suspended plans for a new Jewish enclave in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult for me to say there is hope in light of the current situation,&quot; Assad said at a joint news conference with visiting Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there is anyone who knows what is happening and could say there is hope...everyday we get a new proof that there is no hope,&quot; the Syrian leader said.</p>
<p>The tone contrasted with upbeat comments by many governments such as the United States trying to revive the peace talks, which after the election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May 1996 stumbled from crisis to crisis and then ground to a halt last March.</p>
<p>&quot;Our main concern is lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track and we are encouraged by the recent developments,&quot; Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez al-Tarawnah said in Amman.</p>
<p>Israel on Monday had suspended a permit for a U.S. Jewish land baron to build 70 homes in Arab East Jerusalem's Ras al-Amoud neighbourhood until an appeal by two Jerusalem city council members against the plan is heard on August 5.</p>
<p>Tarawnah, following talks with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Amman, said the suspension of the Jerusalem housing project would advance peace talks -- but a revival of the project would harm them.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider this as a confidence-building measure that would hopefully reinstate the trust between the two sides and that would definitely put the Palestinian-Israeli talks on the right course,&quot; Tarawnah said.</p>
<p>Tarawnah also cited as a cause for optimism talks between Levy and PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath on Monday in which they agreed to renew talks on outstanding issues from a 1995 peace deal.</p>
<p>However, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was dismissive about the new discussions. &quot;This was agreed upon one and a half months ago and up until now nothing has happened,&quot; he told reporters in Hebron.</p>
<p>Tarawnah spoke before the arrival of Mubarak, on his way home from Damascus, to brief King Hussein. Mubarak had warned at his Damascus news conference that a failure to resume the peace talks would be dangerous for all states involved in the process.</p>
<p>Despite the diplomatic flurry, violence persisted in the West Bank. An Israeli soldier shot dead a Palestinian who stabbed and lightly wounded another soldier outside a Jewish settlement near the West Bank town of Nablus.</p>
<p>The postponement of a proposed Jewish housing development in East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed as part of its capital, did not affect other Jewish settlement of occupied land that triggered the halt in peace talks.</p>
<p>Israeli-PLO peace talks have been in crisis since March when Israel began a 6,500-home Jewish settlement on an East Jerusalem hill, seen by Palestinians as aimed at tightening Israeli claims on land they want as their own capital.</p>
<p>Palestinians demand a halt to settlement activity before resuming peace talks. Netanyahu, who rejects the principle of trading occupied land for peace, has encouraged settlement on land captured in 1967, including East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has also backtracked on earlier Israeli offers of at least a partial withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967. Syria demands a full return of the strategic plateau which dominates the surrounding land in both Israel and Syria.</p>
<p>Arafat had problems closer to home on Tuesday when a panel of Palestinian lawmakers investigating corruption urged him to sack his entire cabinet and put at least two ministers suspected of wrongdoing on trial.</p>
<p>It specifically recommended trial for Civilian Affairs Minister Jamil al-Tarifi and Planning Minister Nabil Shaath on suspicion of corruption and misuse of power. Both ministers later denied the charges.</p>
