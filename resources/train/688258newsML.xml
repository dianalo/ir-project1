<p>General Mills Inc, which reported lower earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 25, said Thurssday it expects to resume earnings growth in the fiscal first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Our unit volume momentum entering the new fiscal year is encouraging, and we expect to resume earnings growth in the first quarter of 1998,&quot; Chairman Steve Sanger said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Earlier, it reported earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.42 a share, down from $0.49 a year ago. The First Call mean estimate for the quarter was $0.43 a share, based on a range of $0.40 to $0.49.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking ahead to fiscal 1998, we expect to resume earnings growth due to the improving U.S. cereal market environment, which shows renewed emphasis on product innovation and franchise-building activities that have driven category growth over the long-term,&quot; Sanger said.</p>
<p>General Mills is the second-largest U.S. ready-to-eat cereal manufacturer behind leader Kellogg Co.</p>
<p>&quot;Our rate of growth in fiscal 1998 will depend in large part on the timing and rate of improvement in U.S. cereal category growth, and will likely be strongest in the second half of the fiscal year,&quot; Sanger said.  </p>
<p>General Mills, which also makes baking mixes, yogurt, snacks and other food products, said its other domestic businesses enjoy good momentum.</p>
<p>The company said it continues to achieve significant productivity gains, and &quot;our international operations should make a growing contribution to our sales and earnings progress,&quot; Sanger said. &quot;As a result, we see excellent long-term prospects for achieving our goals of superior growth and returns.&quot;</p>
