<title>TURKEY: Turkey to free jailed editors in partial amnesty.</title>
<headline>Turkey to free jailed editors in partial amnesty.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-08-14</dateline>

<p>Turkey's parliament has passed a law granting a partial amnesty for imprisoned journalists, state-run Anatolian news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Under the new law, newspaper editors regarded as legally responsible for the content of their publications could have their trials halted or their sentences suspended for three years.</p>
<p>But the measure does not prevent continued prosecution of journalists who produce stories in violation of Turkey's many limits on press freedom. Nor does it trim the criminal code's broad definition of thought crimes.</p>
<p>Jailed editor Isik Yurtcu, recent recipient of an international rights award, dissmissed the law as inadequate.</p>
<p>&quot;What is important is that all those imprisoned (for crimes of thought) are set free,&quot; he told Anatolian from his prison in western Turkey.</p>
<p>Efforts by a leftist party to expand the law to include writers, reporters and cartoonists in the reforms were rejected by parliament in a late night session dragging into the early hours of Thursday.</p>
<p>Once approved by the president and published in the official gazette, the new law should lead to the release of number of jailed editors.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) visited Turkey last month to present Yurtcu with an award for his fight for freedom of the press.</p>
<p>The visit sparked government calls for a change in the law to allow the release of imprisoned reporters.</p>
<p>Yurtcu was jailed in 1994 for a series of articles about the Kurdish guerrilla campaign in southeast Turkey published in the pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Gundem.</p>
<p>Yurtcu was the paper's &quot;responsible editor&quot; which means he both managed the reporting staff and was legally responsible for articles printed.</p>
<p>The CPJ said in July there were 78 journalists in Turkey's prisons, the highest number of any country in the world.</p>
