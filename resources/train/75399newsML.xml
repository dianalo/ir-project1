<p>Shenzhen-based China Bicycle Holdings Co Ltd has sharply lowered its 1996 bicycle sales target because of the impact on its exports of U.S. anti-dumping charges, it said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Washington had charged that the Shenzhen-listed firm was dumping its products in the U.S. market, but, after a year-long investigation, U.S. trade officials ruled in June 1996 that they had decided not to impose sanctions on Chinese bicycle makers.</p>
<p>A company spokesman told the China Securities Bulletin that China Bicycle's exports were still hurt by the charges and had lowered its 1996 sales target to 1.20 million bicycles from an original 1.80 million.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1996, the company sold about 600,000 bicycles, compared to 1.30 million in all 1995 and 1.60 million units in all 1994, the official said.</p>
<p>This year China Bicycle will focus on re-building business relationships with foreign customers it lost during the legal dispute, and expects exports to recover fully in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>About 75 percent of the firm's bicycles are exported, with 50 percent going to the U.S. market, he said.  </p>
<p>When asked whether China Bicycle plans to increase domestic sales, the official said profits margins are too low and competition too intense.</p>
<p>The official said China Bicycle's net earnings this year would be slightly lower than the 1995 level but declined to give a figure.</p>
<p>In its interim report, the firm posted net earnings of 8.58 million yuan in the January-June period of 1996, down from 72.53 million yuan in the year-ago period, blaming the U.S. anti-dumping charges.</p>
<p>It did not say whether the results were compiled under Chinese or international accounting standards.</p>
<p>China Bicycle reported after-tax profits of 51.25 million yuan in 1995, compared to 137.21 million in 1994.</p>
