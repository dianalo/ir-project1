<p>South Africa is set for another year of reasonable economic growth in 1997, boosted by strong exports that will cut the current account gap and stop the rand falling too fast, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The survey of 23 local and international analysts, the first since the 1997/98 budget was unveiled on March 12, showed a consensus for real growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.4 percent this year and 3.4 percent next.</p>
<p>After growth of 3.1 percent in 1996, the 1997 outlook is not sparkling but economists said the figure disguises a strong recovery in the non-farm sector. Last year's growth was mainly due to exceptional rains and bumper crops.</p>
<p>Non-farm GDP growth in 1996 was a meagre 1.9 percent. This year manufacturing and services will take over from farming as the main drivers of the economy, said Ben van Rensburg, economic policy head at the South African Chamber of Business.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to achieve the 2.5 percent growth level we are predicting in 1997, the non-farm economy will have to grow at more than three percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hard-pressed consumers and industrialists should also get some relief around mid-year from an expected cut in interest rates, helping the long bond market where yields are expect to fall to 14.15 percent from 15.15 by year-end.</p>
<p>However, some analysts said Reserve Bank Governor Bank would be wary about cutting the key Bank rate from its current level of 17 percent before gauging the impact of latest measures to ease exchange controls, which take effect on July 1.</p>
<p>With the economy seen growing on the back of exports, and imports curbed by weak domestic demand, South Africa's current account deficit should narrow sharply to 3.65 billion rand ($820 million) in 1997 from 8.5 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>That should mean the rand does not repeat the precipitous fall seen in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;With the current account deficit narrowing...the whole balance payments situation will be a lot more comfortable for the next two years. That will feed through into greater stability in the currency,&quot; said Sandra Gordon, economist at Syfrets in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The currency is expected to depreciate gradually, broadly in line with inflation differentials, reaching 4.73 against the dollar by the end of 1997 from 4.44 at present.</p>
<p>Economists were sanguine about inflation, which was expected to peak at around 10 percent late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of this year as the final effects of the rand's depreciation in 1996 come through.</p>
<p>The survey shows inflation for the year should average 8.9 percent against 7.4 percent in 1996.</p>
