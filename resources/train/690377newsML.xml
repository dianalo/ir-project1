<p>Israel's president on Thursday urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet to stop squabbling and get back to work on Middle East peacemaking.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt the peace process is stuck and we are in a serious crisis,&quot; President Ezer Weizman, 73, whose job is largely ceremonial, told the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.</p>
<p>Weizman, a veteran warrior-turned-peacemaker, met Netanyahu, 47, on Thursday hoping to put an end to the prime minister's spats with cabinet comrades.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope...all the ministers will take their seats and after that roll up their sleeves and return to the peace process,&quot; Weizman said in the interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I am trying to offer advice to the prime minister and those ministers I believe should be given advice,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Weizman also saw Foreign Minister David Levy and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in separate meetings over the last two days.</p>
<p>Peace moves with the Palestinians, already at a standstill over Jewish settlement construction, have taken a back seat to a crisis of confidence in Netanyahu's coalition.</p>
<p>Two cabinet ministers have quit in anger. Others have refused to speak to Netanyahu and boycotted his cabinet meetings while several coalition members abandoned him in a parliamentary no-confidence vote this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I worried? Certainly I am worried. Not to be worried is definitely stupid,&quot; Weizman told reporters.</p>
<p>Weizman, an architect of Israel's groundbreaking treaty with Egypt in 1979, has stepped in to prod Netanyahu on peace moves several times since the prime minister, a relative neophyte, came to power little more than a year ago.</p>
<p>Netanyahu also met Levy for an hour in a bid to cool the foreign minister's ire over what political sources said was his exclusion from key political discussions.</p>
<p>The prime minister's office said Netanyahu and Levy would meet again later on Thursday or on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts said Levy and Mordechai, both relative moderates, also opposed giving hawkish National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon a stronger hand in policy-making next week when Sharon is expected to move into the job of finance minister.</p>
<p>Sharon, an architect of Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion and a champion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank and Gaza, wants to be part of a &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; with Levy and Mordechai that hammers out peace strategy.</p>
<p>For Arabs and many Israelis, Sharon's name brings up bitter memories of the 1982 massacre by Christian militiamen of Palestinians in the Beirut refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila when they were surrounded by Israeli troops.</p>
<p>Israel's Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat should however welcome a greater role for Sharon.</p>
<p>&quot;Sharon has a lot of experience, a rich experience. He understands the language, understands the mentality and I am among those who believe that of all things if he enters the negotiations, a chemistry would be established very quickly between him and Arafat,&quot; he told army radio.</p>
<p>Although Arafat has been Israel's peace partner for four years, the hawkish Sharon insists on calling him a &quot;terrorist,&quot; meaning a meeting of the two would be something of an achievement for Arafat, Kahalani said.</p>
