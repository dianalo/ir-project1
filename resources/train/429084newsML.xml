<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana arrived in Moscow on Sunday with pressure growing for progress on the thorny subject of the alliance's expansion, before next week's U.S.-Russia summit.</p>
<p>Solana, who leaves on Monday for a tour of Central Asian states, immediately went into talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the NATO office in Moscow said.</p>
<p>Moscow and NATO are locked in a bitter row over the plans by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to invite in new members at a July summit in Madrid. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are favourites to be the first.</p>
<p>But both sides have indicated recently a compromise is possible and German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was quoted on Sunday as saying that more progress had been made than was generally accepted.</p>
<p>&quot;The matter is now under way,&quot; Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported him as saying.</p>
<p>Senior NATO and Russian aides have been in Moscow this week preparing the ground for Sunday's meeting after Primakov, a former Russian spy-master, handed over several draft texts on different aspects of a deal in Brussels two weeks ago.</p>
<p>NATO sources say they expect that during the Solana-Primakov meeting, the third this year, they would move to more substantive issues ahead of a summit in Helsinki on March 20 between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Primakov adopted a flexible tone in a speech on Friday. &quot;We have been and are against the expansion. We are not going to change our position, because NATO's expansion damages us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time we do not have a veto right, and of course we will never repeat what happened in 1968 in Czechoslovakia,&quot; he said, referring to the Soviet invasion to halt political liberalisation in its former ally.</p>
<p>What Moscow now sought, he said, was a document from NATO that would help guarantee its security. &quot;We want that the essence of this document would be non-advancement of NATO's military infrastructure to our territory,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Diplomats at NATO headquarters in Brussels say the two sides are working on such a document but differences remain.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now two draft texts -- one by Moscow, one by NATO. These two could be merged into a single one, though there would still be many brackets,&quot; one alliance source said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's return to active work after eight months of illness means the West may finally get a decisive response from Moscow. Yet in his annual policy address on Thursday, the Russian president took a hard line against NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO expansion can become a fateful decision which will cost the peoples of Europe very dear,&quot; he said, adding that there could be no security system in Europe without Russia.</p>
<p>At a news conference on Friday Clinton voiced hope for progress during his two-day meeting with Yeltsin, but said he expected to face tough issues.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect that the Helsinki meeting will be positive,&quot; he said. &quot;But you should understand that this is a tough debate and that they have reasons in their own psyche and circumstances that make it a difficult one.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton added that NATO wanted &quot;a special relationship with Russia and does not rule out even Russian membership in a common security alliance&quot;.</p>
<p>Primakov will visit the United States from March 15 to 17 for talks ahead of the Clinton-Yeltsin summit.</p>
