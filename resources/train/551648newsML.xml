<headline>Sinn Fein leader Adams bids for UK election seat.</headline>

<p>Britain and Ireland say a vote for Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams in Thursday's general election is a vote for more guerrilla war by his IRA sympathisers.</p>
<p>But Adams, canvassing for support in West Belfast, the stronghold of Catholic nationalists who want a united Ireland, says a vote for Sinn Fein is a vote for peace.</p>
<p>To howls of protest from his Protestant opponents, he portrays himself as a crusader for peace, saying his party needs to gain a foothold at the heart of Britain's political system.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein says it could capture as many as three seats in the election but will leave them empty, since to do otherwise would entail allegiance to Britain whose rule of Northern Ireland it dismisses as illegal, colonial and irrelevant.</p>
<p>Relaxed and at ease on his home ground, Adams appears unaffected by an unprecedented attack from the two governments who shaped a Northern Ireland peace initiative held hostage by Irish Republican Army (IRA) warfare.</p>
<p>Adams wants immediate entry into peace talks on the region's future, but Britain says he will be barred until the IRA restores a 17-month ceasefire it broke in early 1996.</p>
<p>He moves about the streets of red-bricked terraced houses like a neighbourhood boy made good. Everybody knows him. Children shout &quot;Hey Gerry&quot; as he passes a parade of shops.</p>
<p>A polished performer, Adams asks them about the result of an inter-schools hurling game, a uniquely Irish sport, or replies, &quot;What's the craic?&quot; an Irish expression which translates as &quot;What's happening?&quot;</p>
<p>He prefaces each electioneering rally with a few sentences of the Irish language, a tongue used by a tiny percentage of people in the Irish Republic with which Adams and Sinn Fein would unite British-ruled Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>But the symbolism is lost on no-one. Adams sees himself as a descendant of the Irishmen who fought to end rule by Britain, which tried to ban the Irish language to bury the national identity it represented.</p>
<p>Demonised by Britain, Ireland and Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant Unionists as a terrorist flying the flag of convenience of a politician, Adams' political arguments are well-rehearsed and couched in unflappable soundbites.</p>
<p>He deflects criticism, saying it is the British government, the pro-British Unionists and the Irish government that is to blame and turns the argument round.</p>
<p>&quot;What I want is for all of us to work together, collectively with mutual respect to take the gun out of Irish politics. I have been shot, my family has been shot at, my house has been attacked, but I say to the poeple responsible that we must work together for peace.&quot;</p>
<p>Adams wants immediate entry into peace talks on the region's future, but Britain says he will be barred until the IRA restores its ceasefire.</p>
<p>&quot;Sinn Fein believes that this election provides a new opportunity to restore the peace process,&quot; Adams said as he knocked on doors in the heart of West Belfast.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that this conflict is approaching its end-game and we think that the important thing is to get as much political strength as possible so as to bring that to negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>On the streets of West Belfast, Adams and his Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Catholic nationalist rivals are locked in a battle for supremacy. Pundits tip Adams as front runner to regain the seat, which he lost to the SDLP in 1992 after holding it since 1983.</p>
<p>Britain says that whether or not Adams wins a seat in parliament, he will remain barred from Northern Ireland peace negotiations until the IRA renounces violence.</p>
