<p>An untried Spanish doubles team made the home fans suffer on Saturday before beating Denmark and guaranteeing the point that gave Spain a 3-0 lead that takes them back to the Davis Cup World group.</p>
<p>After singles victories in which Alberto Costa and Carlos Moya had lost only six games between them, Spain looked to be on the way to a straightforward victory.</p>
<p>But after going two sets up, Tomas Carbonell and Alex Corretja lost their way against Kenneth Carlsen and Frederik Fetterlein.</p>
<p>Fetterlein, having dropped his serve at the end of the first two sets, recovered his form and began to force errors out of the Spanish pair, playing together for the first time.</p>
<p>The Danes had three break points to go 4-1 up in the fifth, but the Spaniards survived a disputed line-call, and lifted by the crowd, came back to win 6-4 7-5 4-6 5-7 6-3.</p>
<p>Earlier Carlos Moya had raced to victory in his match with Carlsen, postponed because of rain from Friday. Moya played superb baseline tennis to win 6-1 6-2 6-1.</p>
<p>In Friday's match Alberto Costa had dispatched Fetterlein 6-0 6-0 6-2. Spain lost their World group status last year after falling to Mexico.</p>
