<p>A small Maryland biotechnology firm has sued food processing giant Archer Daniels Midland Co. seeking damages of up to $300 million over technology used to make farm-raised salmon pink.</p>
<p>ADM, meanwhile, filed a patent infringment lawsuit against the firm, Igene Biotechnology Inc. of Columbia, Md., over the same technology.</p>
<p>An ADM spokeswoman said the Decatur, Ill. company believes Igene's suit against it has no merit.</p>
<p>Igene, in turn, considers ADM's patent suit &quot;frivolous,&quot; according to attorney Kristan Peters-Hamlin of law firm McGuire Woods Battle &amp; Boothe.</p>
<p>In its suit, filed three weeks ago, ADM claimed that Igene's technology violates a patent ADM recently acquired from Universal Foods Corp. ADM said it was seeking an injunction against Igene and unspecified damages for the alleged patent infringement.</p>
<p>In its suit, filed this week, Igene is seeking damages for the alleged theft of documents related to the production of astaxanthin, a pigment that gives farm-raised trout and salmon the pinkish colour found naturally in fish that grow in the wild.</p>
<p>Igene valued its technology at more than $100 million. If successful in pressing its claim under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) statute, it would be eligible for up to treble damages.</p>
<p>Igene also claimed it was eligible for a $450,000 payment from ADM under a previous agreement for testing the astaxanthin technology.</p>
<p>Igene claimed in its suit that certain trade secrets related to the technology were stolen by a former Igene employee, Ali Nikmehr, who allegedly passed the secrets to ADM.</p>
<p>Nikmehr was arrested on July 16 at Igene and charged on one felony count of theft and one misdemeanor count of theft of trade secrets, according to Sgt. Steven Keller of the Howard County Police in Ellicott City, Md. Nikmehr, who has been fired from Igene, was released on $10,000 bond.</p>
<p>Igene's attorney said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had been notified. She declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Last year, in an unrelated legal action, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of price-fixing and paid $100 million in fines as a result of a Justice Department investigation of the livestock feed and feed additives industry.</p>
