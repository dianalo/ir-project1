<p>China's Everbright Bank is working toward listing shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong after raising 2.47 billion yuan ($240 billion) by transformation into a joint stock bank, the China Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Everbright, China's first joint stock bank, would be able to use stock flotations to raise extra capital and boost its ability to withstand risk, the newspaper quoted bank Deputy President Xu Bin as saying.</p>
<p>It gave no details of when the bank hoped to list in Hong Kong or whether it hoped to issue foreign currency or domestic shares in Shanghai.</p>
<p>China Everbright (Group) Corp, the bank's parent corporation, holds 51 percent of its total shares while the other 131 shareholders hold 49 percent, a shareholders' report showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 131 other shareholders included large and medium-sized state firms and the Asian Development Bank, and had purchased their total of 1.37 billion shares at 1.8 yuan per share, 0.8 yuan higher than the face value of each share, the report said.  </p>
<p>The Asian Development Bank had signed a technical agreement with Everbright Bank under which each would contribute $600,000 in 1997 to upgrade the Chinese bank's risk controls and internal management, the China Daily said.</p>
<p>It quoted bank Chairman Zhu Xiaohua as saying the transformation of the bank into a shareholding firm was a strategic step to counter growing competition from Chinese and foreign commercial banks.</p>
<p>Everbright would use its profits to set up between 10 and 15 new branches and up to 25 sub-branches over the next three years and would develop new business in areas such as credit cards and bank cards, Zhu said.</p>
<p>It would also try to establish modern electronic banking systems, he said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Everbright's assets totalled 52.9 billion yuan at the end of 1996, up 57 percent compared with the year before, the China Daily said. Its capital was 4.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Outstanding deposits totalled 32.7 billion yuan, it said.  </p>
