<p>Ratings agency Standard and Poors (S&amp;P) Corp said on Tuesday it had downgraded the credit ratings of Thai Farmers Bank Plc and Siam Commercial Bank Plc to BBB-plus/A2 from A-minus/A2.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said it had also placed the BBB/A2 ratings of Bank of Ayudhya Plc and the A/A1 ratings of Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand on credit watch with negative implications.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said it had affirmed the A minus/A2 ratings on Bangkok Bank Plc and the BB plus/B ratings on Bank of Asia Plc.</p>
<p>It said the rating outlooks for Thai Farmers, Siam Commercial, Bangkok Bank and Bank if Asia had been changed to negative from stable.</p>
<p>&quot;The rating actions recognise Standard and Poor's concerns about the deteriorating condition of Thailand's financial sector, which has come under increasing pressure with the downturn in the property market and a slowdown in the economy,&quot; S&amp;P said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The extent of the banking sector downturn is expected to be more significant and prolonged than is currently expected by both the regulators and the individual banks,&quot; the ratings agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent initiatives by the Bank of Thailand may not be sufficient to contain problems within the property sector, resulting in a substantial rise in the current level of non-performing loans,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said the rating downgrades of Thai Farmers and Siam Commercial reflected the need for further provisions which would significantly affect profitability and capital levels.  </p>
<p>Bank of Ayudhya would also by affected by worsening asset quality and the bank had been placed on negative creditwatch until the bank's parameters could be assessed within the next two weeks, the agency said.</p>
<p>Industrial Finance Corp's creditwatch status reflected the financial pressures on industrial borrowers and the bank's high exposure to the stock market, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>While Bangkok Bank was not insulated from problems that have emerged in Thailand, the bank's ratings affirmation reflected its superior level of loan loss provisions and stronger busines franchise relative to its peers.  </p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the rating on Bank of Asia already recognise the bank's higher vulnerability to industry downturns because of its weaker business and financial profile compared with higher rated peers,&quot; S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>Earlier, S&amp;P said it had affirmed Thailand's A/A1 ratings and kept its outlook stable, but said it noted heightened industry risk for the banking sector.</p>
