<p>*Australian bonds end in negative territory after uninspired day dominated by softer U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>*Market waiting on labour force data on Thursday. Treasury Assistant Secretary Hinton speaks in Sydney later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Australian bonds were unable to break into the black on Wednesday, finishing in negative territory after being weighed down through the day by softness in U.S. Treasuries due to quarterly refunding.</p>
<p>The best bonds could manage on the day was to draw level with their previous closes, but a bearish tone saw the market retain a softer bias, most notably at the long end which weakened by about six points.</p>
<p>&quot;That's primarily what it is, just a bit of concern about the States,&quot; one trader said, adding the local market was now waiting on Thursday's July labour force data for guidance.  </p>
<p>Forecasts centre on a rise in July employment of 25,000 and an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent, which economists said would show the labour market remained sluggish.</p>
<p>That was one of the factors, along with low inflation and modest growth, that helped propel bonds to record highs last week after the RBA cut official rates on Friday.</p>
<p>The modest growth outlook was reinforced by Wednesday's National Australia Bank business survey showing a deterioration in business condtions for July and an inability of firms to pass on price increases.  </p>
<p>&quot;Overall today's data would not dissuade anyone from the view that the bias in official interest rates remains titled towards the downside, although we remain of the view that monetary policy is on hold for the foreseeable future,&quot; Bankers Trust Australia senior economist Peter Munckton said.</p>
<p>Treasury First Assistant Secretary, Investment and Debt Division, Tony Hinton was due to give a speech in Sydney titled &quot;The Commonwealth Budget:Financial Market Program and Debt Management Strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>Hinton starts his speech at 6.00 p.m. (0800 GMT).  </p>

<p>Short end spreads narrow across the board, but losses at the long end see spreads there end generally wider. That long end weakness sees the curve continues to steepen, as is now at its steepest level since since July 15.</p>
