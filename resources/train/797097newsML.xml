<p>Better results from its spirits, wine and music businesses boosted fourth-quarter earnings at Seagram Co. Ltd., the beverages and entertainment company said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Montreal-based Seagram said net income for the fourth quarter ended June 30 rose to $148 million, or 40 cents a share, from $89 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Revenues rose to $3 billion from $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>For the full year, Seagram's net profit rose to $502 million, or $1.36 a share, from $142 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Revenues increased to $12.6 billion from $12 billion.</p>
<p>The 1997 fourth-quarter net profit figure included a $100 million after-tax gain on the sale of 30 million Time Warner Inc. shares in the latest fourth quarter, compared with a $67 million after-tax gain a year earlier on a settlement reached with the U.S. government regarding a 1981 share transaction.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's latest fourth-quarter net income before special items of $48 million, or 13 cents a share, was in line with expectations. The year-earlier net profit before gains was $22 million, or 5 cents a share.</p>
<p>&quot;They came in line with consensus and a couple cents better than our estimates,&quot; said Jill Krutick, entertainment analyst at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Seagram said pretax earnings at its 80 percent-owned Universal Inc. entertainment unit increased 36 percent, due largely to a turnaround in the music group and strong performance in the company's recreation and theme park operations.</p>
<p>Filmed entertainment pretax profits were mainly flat despite brisk ticket sales for blockbuster films such as Stephen Spielberg's &quot;The Lost World&quot; and &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, a comedy starring Canadian Jim Carrey.</p>
<p>Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. holds the remaining 20 percent of Universal.</p>
<p>In a statement, Seagram President and Chief Executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. said the company's Spirits and Wines group posted strong results because of growth in several key brands in North America, including Captain Morgan Rum and Crown Royal Canadian Whisky, and because of benefits from the group's restructuring.</p>
<p>Seagram's Tropicana Beverage Group had an &quot;excellent year,&quot; mainly because of sales of its Pure Premium juice brand in North America, Bronfman said.</p>
<p>Seagram shares slipped C$1 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday to C$48.00, after a C$1.40 decline on Tuesday. On the New York Stock Exchange, Seagram fell 81 cents to $34.44.</p>
<p>Analyst Krutick said investors were expecting the company to extract better returns from its operating assets, especially its music labels.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a very clean balance sheet and a fair amount of financial flexibility, and the market is eager to see them put it to good use,&quot; Krutick said.</p>
