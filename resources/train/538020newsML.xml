<p>Spot heating oil values in New York Harbor remained weak late Friday afternoon just as octane values retained much of the strength they built up earlier in the week, traders said.</p>
<p>Action was subdued to be sure, but Sun Co's lowering of its posted price for NYH heating oil set the tone for heating oil, just as widespread but imprecise talk about refinery problems fueled the strength in premium gasoline values.</p>
<p>Prompt NYH 76-grade heating oil was still offered at 2.50 cent over May NYMEX as Sun's offer, 1.50 cents below Thursday, made buyers scarce and hungry for even cheaper prices.</p>
<p>Whether the softer distillate prices combined with firmer premium gasoline prices signaled a seasonal transition in focus to the lighter end of the barrel was unclear, but the strength in premium grades both in NYH and Houston was.</p>
<p>Traders said NYH &quot;D2&quot; 93-octane premium was talked at about 12 cents over May NYMEX futures.</p>
<p>&quot;D2 doesn't go to 12 cents over the screen without someone having a reformer problem,&quot; said one trader, noting Star may have had a problem at its Delaware City, Delaware refinery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Houston, &quot;V1&quot; 93-octane conventional premium was still at 4.50 cents over USG regular unleaded.</p>
