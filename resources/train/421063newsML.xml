<headline>Taiwan to keep loose policy for economy on low CPI.</headline>

<p>Taiwan's latest CPI report on Wednesday showed inflation under tight control, and economists said the government should try to coax capital from overheated stocks toward property and other under-financed sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;With inflation under control, the state should try to redirect loose liquidity to boost domestic investment, the property market and other sectors and not focus too much on the stock market,&quot; said Nomura Securities economist Amy Huang.</p>
<p>Taiwan's February consumer price index rose just 2.03 percent compared to February 1996, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics announced.</p>
<p>The increase came in below an average 2.54 percent forecast compiled from a March 4 Reuters Poll of economists.</p>
<p>And, it was well below an official full-year 1997 target of 3.0 percent set by the cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development and prompted the central bank to lower its 1997 forecast to 3.0 from 3.31 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said the low CPI should enable the central bank to maintain its long-standing &quot;stable-to-loose&quot; monetary policy despite growing worries that loose liquidity -- rather than fundamental value -- was driving Taiwan's stock market boom.</p>
<p>&quot;The lower-than-expected February CPI growth is very positive,&quot; said Grand Cathay Securities economist Terry Chen.</p>
<p>&quot;Without inflation worries, the central bank likely will continue its current monetary policy so as to help boost the economy's still-slow recovery,&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>The benchmark TAIEX index on Wednesday shook off investor jitters about a possible monetary policy tightening, gaining 0.79 percent to notch a six-year high close at 8,019.46.</p>
<p>The index has gained more than 1,000 points in 1997 alone, prompting the central bank to warn on March 1 that investors should exercise caution as the rally sizzles on.</p>
<p>Taiwan's gross domestic product grew a year-on-year 6.62 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, up from 5.12, 5.42 and 5.61 percent in the first three quarters. This raised hopes of a quickening recovery and fuelled stock market fever.</p>
<p>With inflation cool and hopeful economic signs, economists said the central bank was in a position to base its monetary policy considerations more explicitly on keeping the stock market in check.</p>
<p>Experts said the central bank would not tackle the problem by raising interest rates, but should try to soak up liquidity and persuade investors to move some capital out of the bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank is unlikely to raise the rediscount rate or other rates in the near term, which surely would hurt the recovery,&quot; said National Securities economist Lin Kuo-yang.</p>
<p>&quot;At most it will control liquidity by conducting open market operations in the money market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Economists said the central bank may issue further warnings if stocks continue to rally on speculative buying.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank may demand more bank caution in financing, monitoring where lent funds flow to,&quot; said Nomura's Huang.</p>
<p>Experts cautioned the government itself was counting on a bullish stock market to ensure healthy returns in the ongoing privatisation of many state enterprises.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said in January it planned to release some 800 million state-owned shares worth T$100 billion (US$3.6 billion) in fiscal 1997/98 (July/June).</p>
<p>(US$1 = T$27.5)</p>
