<p>TransTexas Gas Corp said it expects increased production and improved natural gas prices to generate fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.37, below the $0.40 consensus being reported by First Call for the three months ending January 31.</p>
<p>The company said its cash flow for the current quarter will be about $0.90 per share; and earnings before interest, taxes, depletion, depreciation and amortization are expected to exceed $90 million.</p>
<p>For the year earlier quarter, TransTexas noted, it reported a loss of $0.17 and EBITDA of $47.4 million.  </p>
<p>The difference between the company's expectations for fourth quarter earnings and the consensus of analyst estimates is tax treatment, TransTexas spokesman Simon Ward said.</p>
<p>Stating it was responding to analyst inquiries concerning the impact of commodity pricing, the company said it realized an average natural gas sales prices of slightly over $3.00 per thousand cubic feet in the first two months of the quarter.</p>
<p>Currently, TransTexas said, it is receiving over $3.40 per thousand cubic feet for deliveries at its Agua Dulce, Texas, marketing hub and it expects that the average for January will exceed $3.25 per thousand cubic feet.  </p>
<p>Additionally, pricing of natural gas liquids that TransTexas Transmission Corp extracts from its gas production stream have increased to more than $0.40 per gallon and are further improving margins, the company said.</p>
<p>It noted that production of natural gas and oil have improved largely as a result of its development of the Bob West North and Fandango South natural gas fields in Texas and the new Lodgepole oil field discovery in North Dakota.  </p>
<p>TransTexas said it is now the third largest producer of natural gas in Texas with gross natural gas and oil production capacity, including third-party operated wells, of 800 million cubic feet equivalent per day.</p>
<p>About 300 million of this is coming from the Lobo Trend, Ward said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on a published report the company is close to an agreement to sell its Lobo Trend field to DuPont Co's Conoco Inc subsidiary.</p>
<p>A Conoco spokesman also declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Ward did say the company has &quot;had several interested parties come into (its) data room&quot; since announcing in late August it had engaged investment bankers to help with the sale of its Lobo properties in Webb and Zapata counties of South Texas.</p>
<p>Included, it said at the time, is a 1,100 mile pipeline system from the Lobo Trend to the Agua Dulce marketing hub near Corpus Christi, Texas, and the company's interest in North Dakota's Lodgepole formation.</p>
