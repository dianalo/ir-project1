<p>No clear trend is seen for Southeast Asian palm and laurics oil prices this week, although a possible rise in coconut production in coming weeks could dampen Philippine coconut oils, traders said.</p>
<p>Regional palm oil traders had mixed views on the markets' direction this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect prices for coconut oil to drop $20 for nearby months,&quot; a Filipino trader said.  </p>
<p>Trade group United Coconut Association of the Philippines said coconut oil was traded at an average of $738.50 per tonne CIF for August/September and $720 CIF for September/October.</p>
<p>&quot;People are seeing more copra coming from the Philippines,&quot; said another trader in one of the country's largest coconut oil exporters.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, traders said Jakarta was expected to commence market operations to lower local prices this week when 11,000 tonnes of olein imported from Malaysia was expected to arrive.  </p>
<p>&quot;The near future looks stable but people are waiting for the imported oil to come and they want to see what effect that has on prices and supply,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Another said the government planned to import up to 60,000 tonnes but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;The first shipment of 11,000 tonnes is expected to arrive in two or three days, and should enter the market by the middle of this week,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>But another trader said much of the imports was expected to arrive later this month.  </p>
<p>The market is waiting to see if the oil will belong to the state commodities regulator BULOG or the company importing it.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's BULOG's oil, then prices will fall quickly,&quot; a trader said. &quot;But if it is privately owned, then the company would sell down the market quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>The Singapore palm oil market has been quiet recently and traders have mixed views about the near-term direction.</p>
<p>Earlier expectations of good Chinese demand after the release of its 1.3 million tonnes import quota between now and March had yet to be fulfilled, traders in Singapore said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for demand from China,&quot; a trader in Singapore said.</p>
<p>Some Singapore traders said that while India had been a good buyer of palm oil recently, some of these purchases were now being put back into the spot market.</p>
<p>They said the Indian sales had coincided with an increase in demand from Indonesia to offset any bearish impact on prices.</p>
<p>Malaysian traders said prices were expected to hold firm with sentiment aided by good export fundamentals for August.  </p>
<p>Cargo surveyor Caleb Brett said Malaysia's August bulk palm oil exports were 715,550 tonnes against an estimate of 667,802 for July. SGS (M) Sdn Bhd put the figure at 708,601 tonnes against 649,331 in July.</p>
<p>Third month November futures which closed the week at 1,243 ringgit are expected to trade in the range of 1,230-1,265 ringgit.</p>
