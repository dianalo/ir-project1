<p>July 7-11 traded at -5 cents against August twice and once at -13 cents against September. The month of September also traded at -30 cents.</p>
<p>July 14-18 traded at -19 cents against September and July 21-25 went at -23 cents against September.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel swaps gained up to 75 cents or so with July valued at $85, August between $85.50/$86 and September at about $87.25. Low sulphur swaps were up by a similar amount and August was heard traded at $94.75.</p>
