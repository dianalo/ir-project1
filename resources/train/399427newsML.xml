<p>Iran's stock exchange has proved the exception among surging global equity markets, losing more than six percent in value this year under the weight of new issues and disappointing company results.</p>
<p>Tehran Stock Exchange All Shares Price Index (TEPIX) -- which tracks the performance of 225 listed local firms -- has fallen to 1,843.53 points from 1,969.24 at the start of the year, representing its steepest fall since 1993 when the exchange lost 14 percent in value that year.</p>
<p>TEPIX is stuck close to 10-month lows and is well adrift of its peak of 2,150 reached in September, which at the time made the exchange one of the fastest growing bourses in terms of capitalisation. The Tepix rose nearly 60 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;For two years the index was going up continuously and according to some analysts the market was overheated. It was only natural that somewhere it should have stopped,&quot; a senior official at the exchange told Reuters by telephone from Tehran.</p>
<p>The exchange's index was set in 1990 at just 100 and raced higher as local investors sought a slice of privatised state-owned firms and as a way of protecting their saving against inflation which unofficially ran as high as 50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the fall) started about three months ago after most of the companies announced dividends and earnings per share...most of them didn't have a good performance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The exchange, currently capitalised at 27,320 billion rials ($9.1 billion at the official exchange rate), is dominated by investment funds managed by state banks and heavy industry like vehicle maker Iran Khodro.</p>
<p>Foreign investment is allowed but amounts to less than four percent because of difficulties in repatriating profits.</p>
<p>Selling pressure increased with new company rights issues, &quot;development shares&quot; sold by provinces and municipalities seeking finance and a series of &quot;participation certificates&quot; from other state and semi-official institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Nearly 85 percent of companies listed on the exchange increased their capital...Suddenly the market was full of new shares so it brought down the prices which were high already,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Municipalities and provinces have significantly entered the market by issuing further certificates to finance local construction, industrial and employment projects.</p>
<p>&quot;Now nearly every province has published participation certificates to collect money for new projects...for many small investors this certificate is more safe and regular (than company stocks),&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Bonds and interest payments are prohibited under Iran's Islamic laws but the certificates serve the same purpose as bonds, giving investors a 20 percent &quot;profit on account&quot; return -- or interest.</p>
<p>Provincial authorities have raised 898 billion rials ($299 million) through development shares to date while participation certificates had secured 350 billion rials, the exchange said.</p>
<p>The first municipality issue was in 1994.</p>
<p>Falling stock prices and new investment opportunities such as in state housing projects have caused investors to sell shares, provoking further falls, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;These days the number of people going to the Tehran bourse is less than that of customers at a neighbourhood grocery store,&quot; the local Akhbar newspaper said last week in a critical article which called for more company disclosures.</p>
<p>The Tehran official was confident that the TEPIX would rise again after Iranian new-year holidays in late March.</p>
<p>&quot;It will pick up after the new Iranian year. We are reaching the bottom of this period...now you can buy shares of very important investment companies very cheaply,&quot; he said.</p>
