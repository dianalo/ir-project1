<headline>Delgratia says report shows nevada property a hoax.</headline>
<text>
<p>VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA , May 19 (Reuter) Delgratia Mining Corporation, on the basis of a letter received from an independent auditor, says there is evidence of tampering with core samples from their Nevada property and that there is insiginficant amounts of gold in the deposit.  </p>
<p>The letter dated May 16, 1997, from the independent consultants engaged by the Company to audit drilling, sampling and assaying procedures performed at the Nevada Project set out conclusions they will be reporting in their audit report which will be completed and delivered to the Company by May 23, 1997.</p>
<p>Brian Mountford, P.Eng. and Morris Beattie, PhD., P.Eng stated in the letter that:</p>
<p>&quot;We conclude that there is insignificant gold contained in the Josh Deposit and that any gold detected beyond background amounts was introduced into the samples after they had been collected at the drill.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company said in a prepared statement that the reports of tampering required that they disregard all of their earlier data and results.</p>
<p>Dr. Charles A. Ager, Chairman and President of the Company, said, &quot;I agree that this evidence of tampering with drill samples uncovered by the independent consultants engaged by the Company requires us to disregard the data and results from such samples and to re-evaluate both all of our own results and the results obtained by earlier explorationists in this area, on which we have relied.  </p>
<p>The company said further that it believes the source of the tampering came from outside and it is taking steps to notify U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>Ager said, &quot;The consultants have identified the likely source of the tampering and it does not involve anyone from the Company or Cactus Mining. It is now clear that the Company has been the victim of data falsification.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Company is taking steps to notify law enforcement authorities in The United States of the reported tampering and request that they investigate the possibility of criminal wrongdoing.&quot;  </p>
<p>Delgratia Chairman and President Ager said that the company was suspending all work and commitments on the Josh Property and that he would personally fund, &quot;...a complete review of all the available information...(which)... will then determine, based on untainted data only, whether further funds should be expended on exploration.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon completion of Dr. Ager's personally funded work, he will present his findings for consideration by the Board of Directors.</p>
