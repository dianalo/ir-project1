<p>Sri Lanka's military, battling Tamil Tiger separatists in the north and east, is hunting for more than 10,000 deserters, the Sunday Leader newspaper said quoting military officials.</p>
<p>The paper said military police had launched a country-wide search for deserters and have sought Interpol's help to locate soldiers who have fled the country.</p>
<p>It said more than 30,000 soldiers had deserted the army since 1995, but some 20,000 had returned after an amnesty offer last year.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted officials as saying that two officers of the Sri Lanka Air Force, who had fled to work with the Oman Royal Air Force, had been arrested and brought back.</p>
<p>Military spokesman Brigadier Sarath Munasinghe told reporters last week that the army had announced a crackdown on deserters.</p>
<p>&quot;Deserters will be court-martialled when they are arrested,&quot; he said. He added that in one of the first examples of the stricter penalties, a soldier had been given three years' rigorous imprisonment for deserting his post in the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels.</p>
<p>Three other soldiers were also facing court-martial.</p>
<p>The Sunday Leader said military officials were investigating the reasons behind the high rate of desertion in the nearly 100,000 strong Sri Lankan army.</p>
<p>The armed forces recently launched slick advertising campaigns on television and other media and introduced walk-in interviews to attract recruits to fill depleted ranks.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan military is fighting a 13-year-old war against the LTTE, who demand a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the island's north and east.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
