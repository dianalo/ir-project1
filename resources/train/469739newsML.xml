<p>French bank Credit Lyonnais and U.S. financial and travel services giant American Express announced plans on Wednesday to launch a new corporate payment card bearing both their logos.</p>
<p>The state-controlled bank broke ranks with the French national payment card association which traditionally has worked primarily with Visa and, to a lesser extent, MasterCard to strike the so-called &quot;co-branding&quot; deal.</p>
<p>&quot;This is significant in its own right because it is the first time a French bank has opted to work with American Express,&quot; an American Express spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Visa France had sought to block the deal by presenting an alternative product to the bank, a source close to the negotiations said.</p>
<p>The payment card, to be used at outlets accepting American Express, will be marketed by Credit Lyonnais to their corporate clients to issue to employees for paying business expenses. It is to be made available during the second quarter of this year, possibly in May.</p>
<p>But certain details, such as whether users will be able to access funds from Credit Lyonnais automatic teller machines, still had to be worked out, a bank official said.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais has become increasingly aggressive commercially as it digs out from the 1980s lending binge that almost brought its collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;It enlarges the range of our product offerings to corporate clients,&quot; said a spokesman for the bank.</p>
<p>The corporate card market is still relatively untapped in France. According to one bank estimate, the market for French corporate cards totals 200,000 companies and two million cardholders with potential annual billings of 50 billion francs ($8.8 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;This is an area that has not had a lot of attention from French firms but will in the future as pressure grows on them to save money and be more competitive,&quot; said an industry official.</p>
<p>Since 1996, American Express has been courting partner banks to boost its presence in major global markets after abandoning a go-it-alone strategy of not issuing cards through banking networks other than its own.</p>
<p>The agreement is &quot;part of our new strategy to open up the network of our establishment to other partners and have co-branded cards&quot;, an American Express spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>American Express said the Credit Lyonnais deal marked the first time the New York-based group had joined forces with a banking partner to offer a co-branded corporate card outside the United States.</p>
<p>It has co-branding agreements with several banks in Europe on the consumer side and last year made agreements with three French companies to issue co-branded cards. ($ = 5.683 French Francs)</p>
