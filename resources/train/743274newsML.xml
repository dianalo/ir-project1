<p>Italian carmaker Fiat S.p.A said on Monday that it hoped to manufacture a million 'world cars' or Palios a year by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;If all our plans materialise, we believe that by the year 2,000 we will be producing between 900,000 and 1.0 million world cars a year,&quot; Paolo Cantarella, Fiat's chief executive officer told a meeting of Indian businessmen.</p>
<p>He said Fiat launched the Palio a year ago in Brazil, and so far had sold 300,000 in that country. The Palio range consists of five separate models, including a hatchback, booted saloon versions, a station wagon, a pick-up truck and a minivan.</p>
<p>Cantarella said Fiat had started producing the saloon version, called the Siena, in Argentina. Production of the Palio and the station wagon, the Palio Weekend, had also started in Poland, he added.</p>
<p>He said that Fiat will start producing the Palio soon in Venezuela, Turkey, Morocco and South Africa.</p>
<p>Cantarella said Fiat would establish two outposts in Asia in China and India. He said that negotiations had reached an advanced stage in China.</p>
<p>In India, Fiat has formed a $558 million joint venture with India's Doshi family, which controls Premier Automobiles to produce cars. Fiat holds 74 percent of the joint venture called Fiat India Auto Ltd.</p>
<p>Cantarella said the Indian facility will start producing Palios in 1999, and once fully operational will turn out 100,000 cars a year.</p>
<p>The joint venture plans to build a new plant near the western city of Pune. Indian analysts expect the Indian car market to grow to around one million units in 2000/2001 (April/March) from 345,355 in 1995/96.</p>
