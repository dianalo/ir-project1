<p>Antonio Di Pietro, a former magistrate who helped sink Italy's old governing class over corruption, resigned as public works minister on Thursday after coming under investigation himself, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Di Pietro, named to Italy's centre-left government when it was formed in May, had sent his letter of resignation to Prime Minister Romano Prodi.  </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether Di Pietro's resignation had been accepted. Prodi earlier on Thursday expressed support for his minister, who was a star of the Milan pool of &quot;Clean Hands&quot; anti-graft investigators until he quit in December 1994.</p>
<p>A non-political appointee to Prodi's cabinet, he was the first minister to resign. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said he did not think his departure would threaten government stability.</p>
<p>Di Pietro's lawyer Massimo Dinoia earliler confirmed the former magistrate was the subject of a preliminary investigation. Newspapers said he was being probed over alleged irregularities in the way he conducted his inquiries.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough is enough,&quot; D Pietro wrote in his letter of resignation, which said the decision was irreversible.</p>
