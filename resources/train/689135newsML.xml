<p>Tranche B is HK$50 million revolving credit. Repayment is in bullet. The interest margin is 135 basis points over the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate.</p>
<p>Fees are 50 basis points for lead managers committing HK$21-25 million, and 40 basis points for managers committing HK$15-20 million.</p>
<p>Proceeds are for general working capital and capital expenditure requirements.</p>
