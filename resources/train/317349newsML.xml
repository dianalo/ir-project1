<p>Poland has made big strides towards developing a market economy but must still reduce double-digit inflation and finish privatization and pension reform, economists said over the weekend.</p>
<p>Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister who launched Poland's reform program in 1989, and economists from around the world met at an economic conference sponsored by the CASE socio-economic analysis center.  </p>
<p>&quot;The conference diagnosed Poland's economic situation -- thanks to its first reforms -- as good in comparison to other post-socialist countries.  If it doesn't want to lose its position -- and it can -- it must complete its reforms,&quot; PAP on Sunday quoted Balcerowicz as saying.</p>
<p>Balcerowicz, now the head of the Union of Freedom (UW) oppostion party, also said the country must lower taxes, something one of Russia's reform architects, former acting prime minister Yegor Gaidar, said political factors could slow.</p>
<p>&quot;From our point of view Poland is an example of an economic success, but it has to pay a price.  Taxes are too high, spending is too high, but attempts to change this lead to political crises,&quot; he told the evening television news.</p>
<p>Economists also said Poland needed to improve the functioning of its financial sector, restructure heavy industry and reform its communist-era pension system.</p>
<p>&quot;Without pension reform, the already big state budget deficit will increase even more and Poland will not be an equal partner for the European Union,&quot; World Bank economist Luca Barbone said.</p>
