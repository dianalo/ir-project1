<p>The Chinese air force plans to build up state-of-the-art air force weapons systems by early next century, its commanding officer said as rival Taiwan took delivery of new U.S. F-16 fighters to boost its defences.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall focus our efforts on applying new high-tech to raising combat effectiveness of troops while importing some high-tech weapons that have higher accuracy in hitting the target,&quot; Lieutenant General Liu Shunyao told the Xinhua news agency in an interview released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the rare interview by a senior Chinese military officer and his first since his appointment as air force commander last October, Liu, 58, said China's air force had sharply boosted its offensive capability in recent years.</p>
<p>By early next century, China's air force planned to build up a new weapons system equipped with state-of-the-art early warning planes, electronic warfare warplanes, and ground-to-air missiles, he said.</p>
<p>He gave no details about China's highly secretive programme to modernise its military, which is currently equipped with out-dated hardware and held back by lack of funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese air force is now able to fight both defence and offense battles under high-tech conditions,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>China's air force had developed into a modernised arm of the three-million-strong People's Liberation Army, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese air force is now capable of waging high-level long-distance combats, rapid manoeuvrability, air defence, and providing assistance to navy and ground forces,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The air force now sourced most of its equipment domestically, fielding a large number of Chinese-designed and made high-quality fighters, attackers, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and special-purpose planes, Liu said.</p>
<p>However, military experts said China had a long way to go even though its rapid efforts to upgrade technology and to develop a generation of domestically-made fighters were among reasons that had prompted Taiwan to order 150 U.S. F-16s.</p>
<p>&quot;This is part of the impetus that has driven Taiwan to substantially advance its own air force,&quot; said Robert Karniol, Bangkok-based Asia correspondent for Jane's Defence Weekly.</p>
<p>Taiwan on Monday took delivery of the first two of the 150 F-16 fighter planes it bought to strengthen its air defences in a 1992 deal that angered arch-rival China.</p>
<p>Beijing regards the island as a renegade province and sees sales of advanced foreign military technology to it as an encroachment on its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The timing of Liu's rare remarks on China's air force capability was no coincidence, diplomats and analysts said.</p>
<p>Among China's estimated 4,000 fighters only about 100 could be regarded as of modern design and even these were not at the level of advanced Western fighters, military analysts said.</p>
<p>China was now racing to leapfrog its 1960s air force into a year 2000 fighting machine by working on indigenous designs for aircrafts, electronics and missiles generations ahead of its current inventory, Karniol said.</p>
<p>It was obtaining technical assistance through reverse engineering or direct aid from Russia and Israel and indirect U.S. help through access to its technologies, said a recent U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence report.</p>
<p>China was acquiring SU-27 fighters from Russia, building the Su-27SK air superiority fighter at home under licence from Russia and developing its indigenously designed F-10 multi-role fighter, military analysts said.</p>
<p>China had been expected to test fly the F-10 last year, but this had apparently not yet happened in a sign of possible delays, Karniol said.</p>
<p>However, China's Liu voiced confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next few years the Chinese air force will enhance its deterrent force in the air, ability to impose air blockades and launch air strikes, as well as the ability to conduct joint operations of ground forces, navy and the air force,&quot; he said.</p>
