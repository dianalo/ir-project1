<p>Hungarian meat food processor Pick Szeged Rt said on Monday its consolidated profits and sales in the January-September period were above both last year's figure and this year's nine-month target.</p>
<p>The group reported a nine-month operating profit of 1.937 billion forints, up from 1.48 billion forints for the same period of 1995 and above Pick's own plan of 1.76 billion.</p>
<p>The southern Hungary-based group's total sales rose to 20.466 billion forints from 16.554 billion in the same period of 1995 and were also above the 20.245 billion forint target, Pick said in its results report.</p>
<p>The group's domestic sales revenues were in line with the budget while exports were somewhat better, Pick said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the harsh competition, domestic sales were in line with plans as a result of favourable changes in the product range, volumes and prices,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The group's domestic sales amounted to 12.759 billion forints, compared to the 1995 January-September figure of 11.052 billion and the plan of 12.8 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Export sales revenues grew substantially compared to both the basis and the plan, due to rises in prices, exchange rates, favourable product range, growth in volumes in cut meat and meat parts as well as sales to Russia,&quot; Pick said.</p>
<p>The group's exports rose to 7.707 billion forints from 5.502 billion in the first nine months of 1995 and from 7.445 billion in the nine-month budget.</p>
<p>Pick said that as a result of a favourable temporary export subsidy it tripled its cut meat exports to 4,502 tonnes from 1,502 tonnes in Jan-Sept 1995. Its first-three-month 1996 target was 1,680 tonnes.</p>
