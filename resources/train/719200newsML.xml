<title>SOUTH KOREA: S.Korea to seek apology over Japan's boat seizure.</title>
<headline>S.Korea to seek apology over Japan's boat seizure.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>South Korea on Thursday said it would seek talks with Japan to demand an apology for the seizure of its fishing boats in disputed waters.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to obtain an apology for the illegal kidnapping of our fishing boats and prevent future incidents, we will call working-level talks with Japan,&quot; Shin Sang-woo, minister of maritime affairs, told reporters.</p>
<p>He also said he had ordered maritime police to seize all Japanese boats that cross into South Korean waters.</p>
<p>Shin's comments follow Seoul's summoning of Japanese Ambassador Shintaro Yamashita on Wednesday to lodge a formal protest over the seizures and to demand that steps be taken to ensure such incidents are not repeated.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Japanese patrol vessels detained the South Korean trawler Taeyang No. 102, which was operating in waters recently claimed by Japan as its territory. Japan last month held four South Korean fishing boats for similar reasons.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman said Tokyo released 12 crew members of the trawler on Thursday after an investigation, but was holding the captain of the boat.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Thursday defended Tokyo's move to seize the boat.</p>
<p>&quot;If foreign fishing boats refuse to leave Japan's territorial waters despite warnings, it is natural that we should seize them,&quot; Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Seoul and Tokyo are currently negotiating new fisheries agreements, and South Korea argues that the existing agreement, which has been in force for more than 30 years, must be observed, according to foreign ministry officials.</p>
<p>Japan last January expanded its territorial waters in accordance with a new maritime convention introduced by the United Nations in November 1994.</p>
<p>Japan and South Korea have a troubled relationship stemming from Japan's brutal 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula.</p>
