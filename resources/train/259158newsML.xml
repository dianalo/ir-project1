<headline>French stocks rebound to finish higher.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>French stocks rebounded on Monday in line with other European stock and bond markets which rose after EU leaders agreed on a stability pact to enforce budget disciple after European monetary union is introduced.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 19.16 points, or 0.87 percent, at 2,222.57, recouping half of last week's 1.66 percent loss. The CAC-40 futures contract ended up 15.5 points at 2,222.</p>
<p>Traders said the market also got a boost from an early advance in Wall Street stocks.</p>
<p>But they said investors are feeling cautious ahead of the Bank of France's annual news conference on Tuesday and the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting. The markets are also waiting for the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Volume was 4.77 billion francs.</p>
<p>Michelin shares were among the biggest gainers, closing up 2.47 percent at 165.50 francs to recoup part of their 4.45 percent fall last week on market talk of a capital increase. Company officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Oil majors Elf-Aquitaine and Total both closed up 1.4 percent after announcing deals to buy Iraqi crude under a U.N. oil-for-food programme to ease the hardships on Iraqi civilians.</p>
