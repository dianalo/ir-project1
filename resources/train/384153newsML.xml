<p>White sugar futures perked up in Tuesday afternoon activity as trade houses took their cue from bullish sentiment in New York and pushed the spot May contract towards resistance, traders said.</p>
<p>Outright purchases from trade players triggered some May/August buying, although scale sellers were quick to move in as values climbed higher, they said.</p>
<p>Premium sellers were as usual waiting above the market to cap gains on the May/May arbitrage, which widened a touch as the strength of the London market slightly outpaced that of New York.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing too exciting -- we've got (premium) selling above but New York has pushed up as well,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>At 1745 GMT May was up $2.90 at $306.60, 20 cents under its intraday high. August was up $2.30 at $306.20 and overall volume reached 1,018 lots.</p>
<p>Paris positions followed a similar trading pattern to London in a turnover of 208 lots. May was up $3.00 at $306.00 and August up 50 cents at $304.00.</p>
