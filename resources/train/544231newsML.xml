<p>The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a state may prohibit a candidate from filing for elective office under the banner of more than one political party.</p>
<p>The high court held by 6-3 that laws barring a candidate from being the nominee of more than one party do not violate constitutional rights of political association and expression. It upheld a law in Minnesota, similar to those in 39 other states and Washington, D.C., prohibiting multiple party or &quot;fusion&quot; candidacies for elected office.</p>
<p>The case involved Andy Dawkins, a state representative who was elected as a member of the Democratic-Farm-Labour Party. He faced no opposition in the primary election in 1994. A minor political party, the Twin Cities Area New Party, nonetheless voted to nominate him as their candidate for the same office.</p>
<p>Dawkins agreed to the second nomination and the Democratic-Farm-Labour party did not oppose the move. But the state rejected the second nomination, saying a candidate may not appear on the ballot more than once.</p>
<p>Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for the majority, said the state's ban on fusion candidacies does not violate the New Party's rights under the First and 14th Amendments.</p>
<p>&quot;Minnesota's laws do not restrict the ability of the New Party and its members to endorse, support or vote for anyone they like. The laws do not directly limit the party's access to the ballot,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rehnquist said the laws do not affect the internal structure, governance and policy-making of the party. He admitted they slightly limit a party's ability to send a message to the voters and to its preferred candidates but said the burdens were outweighed by a state's interest in maintaining &quot;ballot integrity and political stability.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Minnesota fears that a candidate or party could easily exploit fusion as a way of associating his or its name with popular slogans and catch-phrases, transforming the ballot from a means of choosing candidates to a billboard for political advertising,&quot; Rehnquist said.</p>
<p>He concluded that states may adopt reasonable election regulations that may end up favouring the traditional two-party political system.</p>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens said in a sharply worded dissent that the court's ruling was based mainly on preserving the two-party system. &quot;It demeans the strength of the two-party system to assume that the major parties need to rely on laws that discriminate against independent voters and minor parties in order to preserve their positions of power,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In some respects, the fusion candidacy is the best marriage of the virtues of the minor party challenge to entrenched viewpoints and the political stability that the two-party system provides,&quot; Stevens wrote.</p>
