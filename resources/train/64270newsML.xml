<p>The United States moved a second aircraft carrier into the Gulf and flew more troops into Kuwait on Thursday in a military buildup aimed at deterring any threat from Iraq.</p>
<p>More than 200 soldiers from the U.S. Army 1st Cavalary Division were bused from a Kuwaiti airport to an arsenal near Kuwait City where they began drawing tanks, armoured fighting vehicles and self-propelled howitzer artillery.</p>
<p>Three thousand more troops were due to arrive in the Gulf Arab state overnight and on Friday and deploy rapidly on a desert firing range 40 km (25 miles) from the iraqi border.</p>
<p>The aircraft carrier Enterprise turned into the Strait of Hormuz to join another carrier battle group, U.S. Navy spokesman Commander T. McCreary said. The U.S. Navy now has seven ships in the region capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles.</p>
<p>The buildup is the latest of several mounted by Western forces in the region since the 1991 Gulf War ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The fresh tension with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein started in August when Baghdad's forces intervened to help a Kurdish faction in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Washington retaliated by firing 44 cruise missiles at air defence targets in south Iraq on September 3 and 4. United Nations observers said some of the missiles violated the terms of a U.N.-created demilitarised zone on the Iraq-Kuwait border.</p>
<p>A Kuwait official said on Thursday tension with Baghdad had subsided slightly but Kuwait's &quot;crisis&quot; with Iraq was not over.</p>
<p>&quot;The threat will stay as long as (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is in power,&quot; the official said by telephone.</p>
<p>But Western diplomats said that without serious provocation the likelihood of a strike on Iraq was now slight.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot have a fixed game plan that is rigid,&quot; one said. &quot;But the coalition is not itching for a fight. We are not looking for the slightest, thin pretext for a fight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The option is there for this to de-escalate without Iraq having to do anything humiliating,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>U.S. Army spokesman Captain Tim Raymond said that under a well rehearsed procedure newly-arrived troops would deploy at the Kuwaiti military's Adera Range desert exercise area after drawing weapons at Camp Doha arsenal north of Kuwait City.</p>
<p>&quot;The troops hit the ground running, draw equipment and deploy in the desert,&quot; said Raymond, adding the troops were equipped with gas masks for protection against poison gas.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't stop until they're in the desert and in secure positions.&quot;</p>
<p>Two more flights are expected to take 700 troops from Texas early on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 3,500 U.S. troops will reinforce 1,200 already here. The buildup also includes the deployment in Kuwait of eight Stealth bombers, over 20 other U.S. warplanes and Patriot missiles and B-52 bombers on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.</p>
<p>The formal mission of the Fort Hood troops is to provide training for Kuwaiti forces, but officials said they could be used in any new military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>Like the USS Carl Vinson already in northern Gulf waters, the Enterprise carries 55 combat aircraft plus 20 helicopters and fixed-wing warplanes including electronic warfare aircraft.</p>
