<p>The Anglican church is reviewing its role during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda in light of accusations of complicity in the killings, the office of the head of the church, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking into the possibility of sending a party of senior people, including a senior judge, to look at church history during that troubled period,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were Anglican and Catholic and other church leaders who have been accused of complicity in the genocide,&quot; Archbishop George Carey said this week in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Carey spoke with reporters during a meeting of Episcopal and Lutheran bishops in White Haven, Pennsylvania. The meeting ended on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are closely involved with the situation there and we are very concerned about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Up to one million Tutsi tribal members and Hutu moderates were killed in 1994 in a spasm of violence by Hutu troops, militias and mobs.</p>
<p>Last year, in a speech at the United Nations, Carey said Anglicans in Rwanda had failed to provide a &quot;shining example&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite many individual acts of heroism and prophetic witnesses, it seems the leadership was in some way compromised and discredited,&quot; Carey said in the September 1995 speech.</p>
<p>Carey said on Sunday the church was now &quot;functioning very well&quot; in Rwanda, although there remained three bishops who had left the country and were unable to return for fear of being jailed.</p>
<p>Although Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops, priests and nuns were among those killed, the churches also have faced accusations from witnesses that some priests and nuns engaged or cooperated in the killings.</p>
