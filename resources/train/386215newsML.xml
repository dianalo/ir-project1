<title>SINGAPORE: Deng rumours spook Singapore stock market down.</title>
<headline>Deng rumours spook Singapore stock market down.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mounting concerns over the health of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping sent the Singapore stock market lower on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Small-capitalised stocks like SMB United and Malaysian shares like MBf Holdings remained active although volumes were not as hectic as previous weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus is more on specific stock fundamentals today,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Those that have retraced are expected to post disappointing earnings next month.&quot; Property developer City Development, shipping conglomerate Sembawang and selected banks were among losers, shedding Singapore $0.30 (US$0.21) to S$0.50. The Straits Times Industrials Index fell 26.31 points to 2,229.79. Turnover was moderate around 337 million shares, with losers outpacing gainers by 375 to 69.</p>
<p>SMB United topped the actives with over 17 million shares on punters' interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>CM Telecom was up US$0.015 at US$0.38 in active trade on a buy recommendation by a research house based on the paging firm's good growth prospects. There was still lingering foreign interest which drove selected blue chips higher.</p>
<p>Dealers said Singapore's 1996 growth data released on Tuesday did not impact the market.</p>
<p>US$1.00=S$1.42</p>
