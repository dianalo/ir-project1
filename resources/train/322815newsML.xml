<p>German industrial giant, Daimler-Benz AG, is set this week to give formal approval to a sweeping reorganisation that promises to leave the company more profitable and lighter on its decision-making feet.</p>
<p>The overhaul, which has been in the works for about a year, ends a nine-year old holding company structure, making each of the group's 23 units more accountable and stripping away entire management layers.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to be a financial holding company,&quot; a senior Daimler official told Reuters. &quot;We want to be closer to the businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>Daimler's supervisory board is to meet on Thursday to consider details of the overhaul which first began to become clear last Thursday when the company announced it was absorbing its Mercedes-Benz AG unit into the group structure.</p>
<p>The supervisory board is widely expected to approve the proposals which have already won acceptance from Daimler's four-man presidium.</p>
<p>Under the new scheme, Mercedes is to be represented on the Daimler board by three executives, one for cars, one for trucks and and one for marketing.</p>
<p>Daimler's two other major units, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA) and its financial services and information technology unit Debis AG, are expected to remain legally independent companies. One management layer at DASA, however, is expected to be eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;It just did not make sense for Mercedes to be separate from the group given that it accounts for about 70 percent of our business,&quot; the Daimler official said.</p>
<p>The restructuring has been warmly greeted by analysts as long overdue evidence that the company is continuing to make strides toward improving share holder value.</p>
<p>Under the direction of chairman Juergen Schrempp, the company has slashed away poorly performing units and set strict profit targets for each business unit.</p>
<p>Daimler is so far mum about how many jobs may be eliminated, saying it remains to be seen how many staffers can be relocated to other positions.</p>
<p>The overhaul scheme was intended to address concerns of Mercedes boss Helmut Wenrer who maintained that the independence of the the car and truck business had to be preserved.</p>
<p>Daimler officials had hoped that by keeping DASA and Debis legally separate companies that Werner would agree to stay on under the new organisation.</p>
<p>Those hopes that were dashed last week when the highly respected car chief said there was no room for someone with his experience in the new group.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate the restructuring will save Daimler several hundred million marks a year once the initial costs of the overhaul are absorbed.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefit may come from Daimler's ability to more quickly respond to market conditions. Under the present structure it can take months for relatively simple matters such as a plant's budget to be finally decided.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be able to move faster than that,&quot; the Daimler official said.</p>
<p>The reorganisation plans end a holding structure which Daimler chairman Edzard Reuter put into place in 1988 as part of his dream of transforming Daimler into what he called &quot;an integrated technology company.&quot;</p>
<p>But over the last two-years it has become clear that Daimler's aerospace business and other technology related fields were unlikely to become a greater share of group business and the company refocused its transportation roots.</p>
