<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited east German towns threatened by floods on Tuesday, saying the spectacular effort by soldiers, aid workers and townsfolk to keep dikes intact exemplified the unity of east and west Germany.</p>
<p>Stepping out of a transport van which had brought him to Hohenwutzen, where over 700 aid workers and soldiers had waged a tense battle the night before to keep the dike from bursting, Kohl stepped onto the dam, shaking the hands of villagers.</p>
<p>&quot;This is where we have to prove that unified Germany is one Fatherland,&quot; Kohl said to a crowd of onlookers who had waited more than an hour for his arrival.</p>
<p>In the background the muddy waters of the swollen Oder river that divides Germany and Poland rushed by, pushing relentlessly against the dike where it makes a bend westward, and Kohl viewed a line of half-submerged trees in Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;A part of this river is Poland and a part of it is Europe and that is why we have to do everything we can so that this border loses its intensity, to bring Poland as quickly as possible into the European Union,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The floods that have ravaged Poland and the Czech Republic, claiming over 100 lives and leaving tens of thousands homeless, were the worst in the region for more than 200 years, Kohl said.</p>
<p>There has been no loss of life in eastern Germany, but damage to homes, farms and businesses has been extensive.</p>
<p>Hundreds of emergency workers on both the German and Polish banks of the Oder battled to reinforce sodden dikes and prevent further flooding as another surge of water was expected overnight.</p>
<p>Floods caused by heavy rain also forced 800 people out of their homes in the Lviv region in western Ukraine and more than 1,000 were evacuated in Romania, where the Danube delta region was particularly badly hit.</p>
<p>Villagers in Hohenwutzen were happy to shake Kohl's hand, but angry villagers barracked him at other stops on his whistle-stop tour through the Oderbruch plains region.</p>
<p>Residents of Altreetz shouted and tugged at Kohl's sleeve to make him listen to their concerns that the rescue efforts appeared intent on allowing low-lying villages to be flooded in order to save larger outlying towns.</p>
<p>For nearly a week, the largest peace-time deployment of German soldiers has been waging a two-tiered defence to save the Oderbruch, which was drained 250 years ago by King Frederick the Great of Prussia.</p>
<p>The first tier involves propping up the main dike that runs 70 km (45 miles) along the length of the Oderbruch basin.</p>
<p>When the dikes were built, the direction of the river was changed and soldiers are hurriedly building a second line of defence along the original path of the river, where so-called &quot;sleeping dikes&quot; rise slightly above the plain.</p>
<p>Helga Scholz, mayor of the village of Alt Maedewitz, climbed down from a pile of sandbags ready for transport to the dike to grab Kohl's attention.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many soldiers working on the sleeping dike. We believe there is not enough being done to save the main dike,&quot; she insisted.</p>
<p>Villagers surrounded the burly chancellor and shouted in agreement, some shaking their fists.</p>
<p>Kohl, putting his hand on the mayor's shoulder, insisted the villagers' homes were not being abandoned.</p>
<p>&quot;I have come here to tell you that the army has orders to hold the main line of dikes,&quot; he told Scholz in Altreetz, where sandbags littered the main square under a canopy of ancient oak trees. &quot;I haven't come here for nothing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Further south, homes have been flooded for days in Wiesenau and Ziltendorf, where a five-km (three-mile) wide sea was created when the Oder broke through the dike, submerging houses up to the rooftops.</p>
<p>Brandenburg state has started mass inoculations against typhoid and jaundice as an extra precaution in case drinking water had become infected, and called on 5,000 people to report for injections.</p>
<p>Authorities in the Polish town of Slubice, across the river from Germany's Frankfurt an der Oder, said eroded dikes there could still yield to the river.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Poland, flood waters receded and weather forecasts were for more sunshine and only occasional showers, although almost 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) were still under water and almost 40,000 people remained displaced.</p>
<p>In Romania, where flooding last month killed 12 people in the Bihor region, weather forecasters said conditions would improve in the next 24 hours, with only occasional showers in mountain areas.</p>
