<p>Australians are getting thinner, drinking less alcohol, smoking less -- and living longer for it.</p>
<p>A survey released on Thursday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics said women were living to an average age of 81 in 1995, up from 79 a decade before. Men were living, on average, to 75 compared with 72.</p>
<p>&quot;Tobacco and alcohol consumption have been declining as has our consumption of fats which have helped to increase our life expectancy,&quot; the ABS said.</p>
<p>The survey, based on 1995 figures, said average daily alcohol consumption fell to 27 ml per adult from 31.5 ml in 1985 and tobacco consumption fell to 4.3 grams a day from 6.7. Daily fat intake fell to 52.2 grams a person in 1993, the last year the question was asked, from 57.5 grams.</p>
<p>As Australians cut back on their smoking, drinking and fatty foods, they have been getting into better shape.</p>
<p>Only 32 percent were overweight, compared with 37 percent a decade earlier.</p>
<p>The bureau said Australia's already low mortality rates were were continuing to fall through better healthcare and lifestyle.</p>
<p>&quot;This decline is mainly due to advances in medical technology and the leading of healthier life styles through better diet, regular exercise and reductions in tobacco and alcohol consumption,&quot; it said. The overall annual death rate fell to 646 per 100,000 people in 1995 from 816 in 1985.</p>
<p>Cancer remained the biggest killer of Australians, killing 178 per 100,000 people per year, compared with 186.</p>
<p>But there was a dramatic fall in deaths from heart disease over the decade, to 151 per 100,000 from 225.</p>
