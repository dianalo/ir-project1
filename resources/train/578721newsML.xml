<headline>Overheated Russian shares take breather - traders.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-05-13</dateline>

<p>Leading Russian shares on Tuesday ticked down from Monday's record performance but traders said the temporarily overheated market could rise again by the end of the week.</p>
<p>&quot;UES has been the locomotive of the past few weeks,&quot; said Sergei Sheikov, head of corporate securities at Raiffeisenbank.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's falling off is a normal correction. I wouldn't worry too much -- the market is growing for now and you calmly can sit tight on your positions.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System of 22 shares closed down at 353.99 on a thin $34.4 million total market turnover. The index closed at a record 360.72 on Monday.</p>
<p>National electricity company UES  EESR.RTS ordinary shares slipped to $0.2975 from Monday's closing $0.3140, while preferred shares eased to $0.2000 from $0.2150.</p>
<p>Oil company Surgutneftegaz rose to $0.8800 from $0.8710 on Monday, but off a record $0.8950 during the day.</p>
<p>&quot;I think overall the market will be tapping its feet until the beginning of summer around today's levels,&quot; said Creditanstalt senior trader Andrei Galperin. &quot;There's still not enough money on the market to drive it up.&quot;</p>
<p>But MFK bank trader Dmitry Konov said prices could be marked up by the end of the week. &quot;At these levels no one really actively sells,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said growth on Wall Street had investors jittery over what the Dow Jones would do next and was having an effect on the Russian market too.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone understands that any reaction on the American market will be reflected in all the others, including the Russian market,&quot; said Sheikov.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 7,293 on Monday, the latest of a series of record highs, but was off in midday trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Investors are also worried the U.S. Federal Reserve could consider raising interest rates at a meeting next week, traders said.</p>
