<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber prices were stable in late trading on Tuesday, with Michelin heard buying end-October shipments, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Michelin bought about 600 tonnes from several parties today at 98.25 cents/kg for end-October shipment,&quot; one trader said, adding that it was probably the SIR20 M grade, which had a slight premium over the regular SIR20 C grade.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't want to sell at that price because it was not to my liking,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The traders also said news of high stock levels in Thailand kept the market quiet, with most other buyers staying sidelined in anticipation of weaker prices.</p>
<p>They said that a Thai industry official who attended a gathering of regional rubber produers on the tourist island of Bali over the weekend had told the meeting that Thailand had stock levels of about 140,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not clear if the amount was stocks waiting to be sold or excess stocks, but the news saw buyers withdrawing from the market,&quot; one said. &quot;Buyers were present at the meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders were unanimous that the news would dampen market sentiment, adding that prices could weaken on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am puzzled at why the Thai official revealed such a sensitive thing at a meeting where buyers were present,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Buyers are obviously going to be sidelined because of the large amount of rubber available in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader said the annoucement could affect the Indonesian market, where buyers were already scarce.</p>
<p>&quot;The Indonesian market will be hit. It was a wrong move, especially at a time when the market is depressed.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said September SIR20 offers were quoted at 44.00 cents/lb fob Medan, 43.75-44.00 cents fob Palembang and Surabaya, 43.75 cents fob Padang and 43.00 cents fob Pontianak and Jambi.</p>
