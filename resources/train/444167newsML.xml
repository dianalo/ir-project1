<headline>Thai mega merger clouded by insider-trading probe.</headline>

<p>Thailand's securities watchdog announced on Friday a probe into executives of the nation's top finance firm Finance One for possible insider trading, the same day the group was due to finalise a merger with Thai Danu Bank.</p>
<p>Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) deputy secretary-general Prasarn Trairatworakul said Finance One executives had sold a substantial amount of shares since 1996 before the planned merger was announced.</p>
<p>Finance One officials were not immediately available for comment on the SEC statement.</p>
<p>Executives of the finance company and Thai Danu were scheduled to sign a memorandum of understanding later on Friday at the central bank to seal a merger.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to look at the transactions involving company executives to see if they violated Article 241 which relates to insider trading,&quot; Prasarn told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a normal procedure for the SEC. If a listed company's executives trade a large amount of shares, we have to monitor whether there is any major news or development following the transaction. And if that is the case, we have to investigate if there is insider trading involved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prasarn did not say what would happen if Finance One executives were found guilty.</p>
<p>But analysts said the case was unlikely to derail the merger with Thai Danu Bank because Finance One executives were the only ones being probed.</p>
<p>The probe follows recent financial turmoil that has forced authorities to order banks and finance firms to raise provisions for substandard loans and finance firms to boost their capital. The measures are seen leading to more mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>According to SEC regulations, executives of publicly-listed companies must disclose to the SEC any purchase or sale of stocks which exceeded 10 million baht ($384,615) or amounted to 0.5 percent or more of paid up registered capital.</p>
<p>SEC sources said Finance One president Pin Chakkaphak, along with his family members and other executives, sold millions of shares between the second half of last year and early 1997.</p>
<p>The firm's executives declared the transactions according to SEC regulations and Prasarn said no one has been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The sales by the executives coincided with a sharp drop in the company's share price, which tumbled to 23.75 baht on February 28 from 133.00 baht last June 3.</p>
<p>The company officially announced the planned merger with Thai Danu on March 3. Stocks in the two companies have been suspended since.</p>
<p>Finance One has been plagued by a liquidity crisis and an accumulation of poor-quality assets due to heavy exposure to the depressed property sector.</p>
<p>Before the planned merger was announced, the company had denied rumours it was in financial trouble.</p>
<p>To prove an insider trading case, the SEC must show that individuals involved in the transations had influenced share-price movements. They must also prove that the deal involved inside information not yet disclosed to the public and that the deals had benefited the individual or his affiliates.</p>
