<headline>Dutch PM opposes &quot;pre-selection&quot; of EMU members.</headline>

<text>
<p>Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok said on Tuesday he opposed any &quot;pre-selection&quot; of members of European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Kok said EMU membership should be determined solely on the basis of EU member states' performance in 1997.</p>
<p>The selection would be made early in 1998 and there should be no &quot;pre-selection&quot; or &quot;speculation&quot; before then, he said.</p>
<p>Kok was speaking at a joint news conference with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.  </p>
<p>&quot;I am a declared opponent of any pre-selection on the basis of any kind of prejudices or bias,&quot; Kok said.</p>
<p>The Dutch prime minister said EMU membership would be decided according to an objective application of the convergence criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no point in politicians making comparisons between countries or making speculative predictions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kok added that countries who wanted to be among the first wave of EMU members would need to have their economies and public finances in a good structural condition.  </p>
<p>&quot;Taking a pill to suppress your fever for a day, when you know you're not really healthy -- that is not a good condition.&quot;</p>
<p>Kok was speaking after more than two hours of talks with Aznar about European Union and bilateral issues.</p>
<p>The Netherlands holds the European Union presidency in the first half of 1997 and hopes to draft a treaty on EU reform in time for it to be signed at a June summit in Amsterdam.</p>
