<p>Thick black smoke rose over oil storage tanks in the Chechen capital Grozny on Thursday, a visible reminder that the flames of war in this tinderbox region are not so easy to extinguish.</p>
<p>A fragile peace has been holding for the past week and most people, including fighters who are tired after almost two years of war, are counting on Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed to silence the guns for good.</p>
<p>Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's security chief and special envoy to Chechnya, might visit the North Caucasus region on Friday, Interfax news agency said. But the tough-talking general has not yet consulted Yeltsin, who is on holiday outside Moscow.</p>
<p>This extraordinary lack of contact has not only raised speculation about Yeltsin's health, but it has cast a shadow over Lebed's peace initiative.</p>
<p>Many Chechens believe there is a &quot;third force&quot; at work in the Kremlin, pulling levers behind the scenes to keep the war going, for political or financial gain.</p>
<p>&quot;Lebed is trying but I doubt that he will succeed,&quot; said the commander of a rebel group in an industrial district of Grozny. &quot;He wants to stop the war and make peace but the third force doesn't want this,&quot; added Said Khamzayev.</p>
<p>Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov are due to resume talks on vital political issues, including plans to postpone a decision on Chechnya's status within Russia until a referendum is organised at some unspecified future date.</p>
<p>But many rebels and civilians here are sceptical about prospects for a lasting peace as generations of conflict with Moscow have fuelled deep distrust among Chechens of their former imperial masters.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hoping Lebed can do something, but we have seen so many peace agreements collapse,&quot; said Mizan, a 55-year-old Chechen woman.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this is a typical red herring from the Russian side,&quot; said Khamzayev, when asked if he believed the ceasefire would hold.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see,&quot; commented another rebel wearing the historical red uniform of Chechen fighters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been fighting for independence for 1,000 years,&quot; said Batya, a 64-year-old rebel who recalled the legendary struggle of Imam Shamil in the last century against Russian efforts to subdue the Caucasus.</p>
<p>&quot;The fight will continue until we get out from under this yoke,&quot; Batya said, adding that this year and next year would be decisive.</p>
<p>On August 6, the rebels launched an offensive in which they recaptured much of Grozny from the Russians.</p>
<p>Now the two sides are manning joint checkpoints in the city as called for in the peace plan agreed by Lebed and Maskhadov.</p>
<p>Russian troops have pulled back from front line positions and many of them are due to leave Chechnya by the weekend under a decree issued by Yeltsin as part of his pre-election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible to cooperate with the Russians for a while,&quot; Batya said. &quot;They say two brigades will stay here but they will be under our jurisdiction.&quot;</p>
<p>Chechens in Grozny, many of whom appear to sympathise with the rebels, are now preparing to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the region's independence declaration on September 6.</p>
<p>There are strong rumours that former Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev might show up for the occasion.</p>
<p>Dudayev was reported to have been killed by a Russian rocket in April and he was succeeded by Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.</p>
<p>But radical rebel field commander Salman Raduyev swore last month that Dudayev was alive and many rebels in Grozny believe this is true.</p>
<p>&quot;Dudayev is alive. I saw him personally and I had my photograph taken with him in June,&quot; Batya said. But he did not have the photograph with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, he will reappear on independence day,&quot; he said.</p>
