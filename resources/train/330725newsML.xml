<p>Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa named an inner cabinet on Friday, a list which included two members who currently serve on colonial Governor Chris Patten's council of advisers.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many capable and dedicated people in the community. Regrettably I cannot include them all in the Executive Council,&quot; Tung said in a statement.</p>
<p>Two members of Patten's Executive Council -- housing authority chief Rosanna Wong and businessman Raymond Ch'ien -- will straddle this year's handover of Hong Kong to China.</p>
<p>He also appointed a veteran former senior adviser to previous colonial governors, Sir S.Y. Chung, to the 15-strong caucus but excluded members of Hong Kong pro-democracy parties, arch critics of Beijing.</p>
<p>Tung, a 59-year-old shipping magnate, was selected last month by a China-assembled panel for the historic post of Chief Executive of Hong Kong when the British depart at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>The democrats boycotted the selection process which they denounced as a travesty of democracy.</p>
<p>Tung expressed gratitude to Chung, 79, for agreeing to come out of retirement. His &quot;depth of knowledge about Hong Kong will be of great value to me, especially at this time,&quot; the leader-designate said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chung angered Beijing in the early 1980s for expressing a lack of confidence in Hong Kong's future but was later forgiven. His name was one bandied around for a while in the early 1990s as a potential candidate for Chief Executive.</p>
<p>Also included in the cabinet was Hong Kong's former Chief Justice, Ti Liang Yang, who retired early and relinquished his British knighthood in order to compete against Tung for the Chief Executive's job.</p>
<p>The list will come as little surprise in Hong Kong. Most of the members are prominent in the pro-Beijing lobby and sit on China-appointed panels and committees responsible for the handover.</p>
