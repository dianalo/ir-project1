<p>Interior Minister Horacio Serpa denied on Monday there were plans to crack down on the activities of U.S. drug agents in Colombia in retaliation for Washington's decision to keep Bogota on a drugs blacklist.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing to that, it's just speculation,&quot; Serpa said, referring to published reports that new restrictions would be clamped on CIA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents in Colombia.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy declines to comment on the number of covert U.S. drug agents in Colombia, and Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia told foreign journalists last week she had no idea how many U.S. agents were operating across the country. But Western diplomats describe the number as &quot;very large.&quot;</p>
<p>Serpa, who met behind closed doors with U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette early on Monday, conceded that there was &quot;displeasure&quot; caused by Friday's announcement that Washington had &quot;decertified&quot; Colombia as a trustworthy ally in the war on drugs for a second year.</p>
<p>But he said there were no immediate plans to retaliate against the U.S. decision, which President Ernesto Samper described on Friday as &quot;profoundly unjust.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the foreign minister has said is that, in light of what happened, it would be worthwhile examining, very objectively and very serenely, the way in which relations should be maintained,&quot; Serpa said.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can doubt that right now there's a need to have good relations with countries all over the world, particularly the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;The government's purpose is to examine the situation in a very constructive way.&quot;</p>
<p>Serpa, Samper's right-hand man and a likely candidate to succeed him, has said he let his U.S. travel visa lapse last year after the president's own visa was cancelled in July because of alleged ties to drug lords.</p>
