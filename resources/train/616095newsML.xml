<headline>OPTIONS - Puts bought to shield BT shareholding.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>UK stock options were thinly traded on Tuesday as traders remained cautious of underlying shares at current levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty about where stocks are heading and this is holding many traders back,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>One of the larger deals by mid-afternoon was in British Telecommunications in which 500 August 550 puts were bought at 114p against buying 500,000 shares at 452p.</p>
<p>The position will limit losses on the shareholding if the share price tumbles because the puts can be exercised in order to sell stock at 550p.</p>
<p>Since 114p was paid for the puts this is effectively selling BT shares at 436p so that the maximum loss from buying the shares at 452p will be 16p per share.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the stock price rallies the gains will be offset by losses from the protective puts.</p>
<p>By 1435 GMT, BT shares were up 1/2p to 451p.</p>
<p>Over in British Steel the main deal was the purchase of 500 October 160 calls at 5p from a trader expecting the share price to go higher in coming months.</p>
<p>British Steel shares were 3/4p higher at 153p.</p>
<p>And in gas company BG a belief that share price volatility will decrease prompted one trader to adopt a short straddle strategy which involved selling 500 June 200 puts at 6p as well as 500 June 200 calls at 6-1/2p.</p>
<p>Provided the underlying shares are exactly 200p at expiry, the deal will then make a maximum 12-1/2p.</p>
<p>BG shares were unchanged at 200-1/2p.</p>
<p>In Barclays Bank, 320 July 1200 calls were crossed at 94-1/2p. The shares were up 21-1/2p at 1260p.</p>
