<p>Santa Fe Energy Resources Inc said on Wednesday it will split into two companies to allow the two sides of its business to operate more efficiently and improve access to capital markets.</p>
<p>Santa Fe said it has filed for an initial public offering of 17 percent of the common stock -- about 7.9 million shares -- of its wholly owned subsidiary Monterey Resources Inc.</p>
<p>After the IPO, Santa Fe said it plans to spin off its remaining 85 percent stake to its shareholders late in the second quarter of 1997.  </p>
<p>Monterey Resources, based in Bakersfield, Calif., will assume substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the western division of Santa Fe.</p>
<p>R. Graham Whaling, the senior vice president and chief financial officer of Santa Fe, has been named chairman and chief executive of Monterey Resources. David Kilpatrick, the manager of Santa Fe's western division, has been named president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>James Payne will continue in his position as chairman and chief executive of Santa Fe.  </p>
<p>Santa Fe said it also intends to buy back shares of its 7 percent series preferred stock at a later date. The conditions of the offer would be determined at that time.</p>
<p>Of the 7.9 million shares of common stock to be offered by Monterey Resources, 6.3 million will be offered initially in the United States and 1.6 million will be offered initially outside the United States.  </p>
<p>The assets to be assumed by Monterey involve predominantly Santa Fe's oil-producing entities on the West Coast, said Ed Hall, a spokesman for the company.</p>
<p>Santa Fe's western division holds reserves of about 214 milion barrels of oil and produces 46,000 barrels a day of oil and oil-equivalent natural gas from one of the largest fields in the United States.</p>
<p>The liabilities principally involve $175 million in debt, Hall said.  </p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co is the lead managing underwriter, and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc and Petrie Parkman &amp; Co are the co-managing underwriters in the United States.</p>
<p>Outside the United States, Goldman Sachs International is the lead managing underwriter, while Morgan Stanley &amp; Co International and Petrie Parkman &amp; Co are the co-managing underwriters.  </p>
<p>Santa Fe will keep oil and gas producing assets in West Texas and the Gulf of Mexico as well as promising international exploration and development projects including those currently underway in Gabon and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.</p>
