<p>China is considering cutting fees for international telephone calls by early next year in a bid to make the sector more competitive, the China Daily newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that local phone call rates as well as domestic mail rates were likely to be increased.</p>
<p>It gave no indication of the size of the telephone rate revisions though it said the postal rate change would be substantial.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had filed a request with the powerful State Planning Commission to lower International Direct Dialing (IDD) rates by the end of 1996 or early 1997, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's state-run international telephone industry is facing increasing competition from call-back services that offer much lower rates.</p>
<p>Charges for local calls would likely be raised because many of China's telecommunications authorities had complained of losses resulting from artificially low rates, the newspaper said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This...has forced local phone companies to delay or cancel plans to upgrade telecommunication lines and other facilities, which has affected communications quality,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A telephone call to Japan costs 18.15 yuan ($2.19) per minute while a call to the United States costs 26.25 yuan per minute.</p>
<p>A letter mailed in Beijing to other Chinese cities costs 0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
