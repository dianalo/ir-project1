<p>Bulgaria's opposition said on Tuesday it would not back a currency board to control the currency if it was implemented by Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, who, it said, proved unable to handle the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot expect the same people who by irresponsible rule have ruined the country and led it to a currency board to be able to implement the system,&quot; said the deputy chairwoman of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces Nadejda Mihailova.</p>
<p>On Monday, Videnov said the government and the central bank had accepted an IMF proposal for a currency board, entailing a fixed exchange rate and severe limits on money supply, and hoped to complete constructing the system in the next two months.</p>
<p>Mihailova criticised Videnov for not seeking a broad political consensus on the issue, describing his decision as &quot;a brutal attempt to compromise a serious proposal for financial stabilisation and salvation of the country&quot;.</p>
<p>The lev has depreciated steadily this year and suffered further sharp falls last week as panicked Bulgarians rushed to convert their savings to dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot expect a government which has exceeded its budget targets twice in one year to be able to carry out the austere policy which a currency board plan demands,&quot; Mihailova said.</p>
<p>Under the mechanism, which aims to restore confidence in the currency and curb inflation, central bank lending to commercial banks and the government is cut, and money in circulation must be strictly matched with central bank hard currency reserves.</p>
<p>The plan must be debated and voted early next year by the parliament, in which Videnov's Socialists have a secure majority.</p>
<p>The UDF said it would support a currency board plan only if the central bank board was replaced. The central bank would be expected to supervise the implementation of the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot expect the people who have produced this crisis to now be able to resolve it,&quot; Mihailova said.</p>
