<p>Lithuania's huge state-run Savings Bank said on Monday that it had a net profit of 226,000 litas in April and that most of its figures rose in the first four months of the year.  </p>
<p>The bank also said in a statement that its assets rose during the first four months of the year to 1.45 billion litas from 1.15 billion litas.</p>
<p>It said that its loan portfolio increased in the same period to 579 million litas from 505 million litas.</p>
<p>It added that its deposits from individuals climbed to 968 million litas from 888 million litas and its deposits from companies more than doubled, rising to 321 million litas from 145 million litas at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The bank said that since the end of last year, 1,700 companies had opened accounts with it, boostings its number of corporate accounts to 12,625.</p>
<p>Despite the rise in numbers, the bank said that its profit for the first four months of the year was less than it was for the same period last year, 1.957 million litas versus 6.049 million litas.</p>
<p>&quot;Since March, the bank has been making payments to the deposit insurance fund, 2.4 million litas in March and April alone,&quot; the bank said explaining why its profit was not as high as its high numbers would suggest.</p>
<p>The bank added that it expected its loan portfolio to rise since the central bank last month lifted all of the restrictions it had imposed on the bank regarding loans.</p>
<p>The bank had a profit in 1996 of 30 million litas after posting a huge loss of 39 million litas in 1995.</p>
<p>The bank is the only one of the three big state banks which has not been slated for privatisation yet. It is the biggest bank in the country in terms of assets.</p>
