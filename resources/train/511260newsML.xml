<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Tuesday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida said Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Commission President Santer would meet reporters at 1430/1230 GMT in the Breydel's VIP Corner.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said Commissioner Neil Kinnock and Dutch Transport Minister Annemarie Jorritsma would meet Swiss Transport Department Head Moritz Leuenberger at 1730/1530 GMT. He said Leuenberger would meet reporters at the VIP Corner at 1930/1730 GMT.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said Commissioner Mario Monti would hold a news conference on capital adequacy of investment companies and credit establishments at 1215/1015 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Jochen Kubosch briefed on today's Court of Justice judgments.</p>
<p>Kubosch also said the Panorama on EU Industry was available in his office.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Barbara Nolan said that Dutch Employment and Social Affairs Minister Ad Melkert and Commissioner Flynn would brief reporters following a meeting between labour and employer groups on a code of conduct on informing and consulting workers in case of plant closures or restructuring in the follow-up to the Renault case. She said that would be about 1800/1600 GMT or 1830/1630 GMT.</p>
<p>In answer to a question, Nolan said there had been a lack of clarity surrounding the existing legislation on this matter.</p>
<p>Asked about sanctions if workers were not informed and consulted prior to collective redundancies, Nolan said they would be considered and recalled that the Commission's original proposal to declare such redundancies void had been rejected by the member states.</p>
<p>Asked to react to the Austrian referendum on novel food, Vale de Almeida said any debate on the issue was a good thing.</p>
