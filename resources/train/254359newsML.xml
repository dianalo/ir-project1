<headline>Cocoa talks near end, Brazil blocks reserve fund.</headline>

<p>Cocoa nations were winding up London talks on Friday but a key decision on how to share the money raised by lucrative buffer stock sales was postponed.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been discussing this for a year and all we could agree to is that a reserve fund is useful,&quot; said Tim Mordan, the UK delegate and the chairman of the ICCO executive committee.</p>
<p>The three-day International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) session also looked at the possibility of honing the accuracy of stocks which provide the platform for planned production cuts.</p>
<p>Consumer and producer members then reviewed progress made in a major tree-stock project which will be presented to the Common Fund for Commodities and secured the initial funding for a new environmental project.</p>
<p>But a decision on using the buffer stock profits to set up a special reserve fund was blocked by Brazil which has already promised the money to the fight against witches' broom -- a cocoa killer that has ravaged its crop in the last few years.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a legal problem there. We have committed the money to research into the witches' broom disease,&quot; said the Brazilian delegate Genesio Almedia. &quot;We have to choose between funding the organization or the witches' broom,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>A decision has to be made by March and delegates were likely to settle for a fund of three million stg ($4.9 million) after producers threw their weight behind a figure between 3-4.3 million ($4.9-7.1 million), edging closer to consumers' ideas.</p>
<p>Producers were previously backing the ICCO executive director Eduard Kouame who favours a larger fund of 5-6 million stg ($8.2-10 million) to generate more interest income for the group's activities.</p>
<p>The sticking point was how to allocate a last tranche of some $330 million expected to pile up in ICCO coffers from the sale of 250,000 tonnes of buffer stock cocoa by 1998. These were gathered through a levy system mostly charged on producers.</p>
<p>Most delegates, except Brazil, agreed to set aside some $4 million surplus profit expected from the sale of buffer stocks. There were also divisions on the purpose of such a fund. Consumers said the objective should be a future liquidation of the present cocoa agreement but producers were eyeing generous interest earnings to finance the group's house-keeping costs.</p>
<p>The ICCO agreed to overhaul its stock calculations after a working group of experts said it had overestimated 1995/96 world stocks at 1.4 million tonnes. Other trade estimates range between 1.1-1.2 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The discrepancy seemed to arise mainly from an assumption of 94,000 tonnes of unallocated cocoa beans as well as 90,000 tonnes of beans in transit which traders said was too high.</p>
<p>Stocks are crucial to monitor the ICCO's bid to cut world production by 90,000 tonnes in the next three years. The cuts are aimed to bring the stocks/consumption ratio to 34 percent from around 50 percent now.</p>
