<p>Round two in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bout with corruption allegations begins on Wednesday with opposition legislators asking judges to order his indictment.</p>
<p>The High Court of Justice will hear five petitions relating to the affair which state attorneys said raised &quot;real suspicions&quot; of corruption against Netanyahu and his justice minister but did not warrant prosecuting them.</p>
<p>Legal experts said chances the court would force state attorneys to press charges were slim.</p>
<p>&quot;The high court will check...every iota of evidence before deciding if to intervene,&quot; said law professor Zeev Segal of Tel Aviv university.</p>
<p>Petitioners argue that it was &quot;highly unreasonable&quot; for Netanyahu and Justice Minister Tzachi Hanegbi to have escaped indictment last month after police recommended both be tried for fraud and breach of trust in the ill-fated appointment of an attorney general last January.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel One Television alleged the appointment of lawyer Roni Bar-On was part of a deal to win a plea bargain for key coalition legislator Aryeh Deri in his corruption trial.</p>
<p>Deri is the only figure in the affair to face an indictment. Bar-On, who quit 12 hours after taking office amid a public outcry that he was unqualified for the job, was cleared by prosecutors.</p>
<p>The investigation against Netanyahu's director-general, Avigdor Lieberman, is still being conducted.</p>
<p>&quot;Justice was not served. The state attorney's decision did not take into account the degree of the prime minister's involvement in the affair,&quot; one of the petitioners, parliament member Ophir Pines-Paz, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The petitioners also ask judges to appoint a state commission of inquiry to investigate the affair and make police findings public.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, 47, said in a televised speech last month the report issued by prosecutors cleared him of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The results of the three-month police probe prompted members of Netanyahu's own government to call for the dismissal of Hanegbi as the country's overseer of justice but the prime minister's coalition has remained intact.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is I didn't commit any crime and the attorney general confirmed that,&quot; Netanyahu said last month.</p>
<p>He apologised for any mistakes in the January appointment, but said the media and opposition had tried to use the affair &quot;to overthrow the government&quot;.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Netanyahu announced he would not sack Hanegbi, 40, concluding he was still fit for the job.</p>
<p>Asked if Lieberman would remain, Netanyahu said: &quot;Yes, as long as he wants to continue in the post.&quot;</p>
<p>Some political analysts had speculated Hanegbi would be shuffled out of the justice ministry if his predecessor Yaakov Neeman is cleared this week of obstructing justice and lying to judges.</p>
<p>Neeman, who stepped down last August after being indicted, will hear the verdict in his own case on Thursday.</p>
