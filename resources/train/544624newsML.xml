<p>Economic policymakers from major industrial nations faced fresh questions about their resolve to stabilise currency rates on Monday as the dollar climbed on world currency markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect the U.S. currency to rise even further in the weeks ahead and questioned whether the Group of Seven had the will, or the way, to curb it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard for the G7 to stop the dollar on basis of economic fundamentals, which are still very positive,&quot; said Chris Iggo, chief economist at BZW Securities Inc.</p>
<p>U.S. interest rates are on the rise, making the dollar a more lucrative currency for investors to hold -- no matter what the industrial nations may want.</p>
<p>The G7 -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- warned on Sunday of the dangers of big shifts in currency rates that could hurt world trade.</p>
<p>The dollar has risen by more than 50 percent against the Japanese yen over the past two years, boosting the competitiveness of Japan's exporters on world markets and threatening to push up the Asian nation's trade surplus.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Sunday, the G7 opposed wild swings in currency rates and said it would monitor the markets to see if their wishes were carried out.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excess volatility and significant deviations from fundamentals are undesirable,&quot; the G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs said.</p>
<p>The initial reaction from the markets to the G7's call for currency stability was not encouraging. In the immediate aftermath of the communique's release, the dollar pushed as high as 1.7389 marks, its highest level in over three years, and above 127 yen, just shy of a 4-1/2 year peak of 127.19 touched earlier this month.</p>
<p>Although Sunday's statement went beyond that issued by the G7 at their last meeting in Berlin in February, it failed to single out explicitly the dollar/yen rate as a concern.</p>
<p>Nor did it specifically mention the possibility of G7 nations intervening in the markets to stop the dollar's rise by selling greenbacks.</p>
<p>Analysts said the absence of such language should open the door for additional dollar gains in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>&quot;They clearly are not worried about the level of the dollar at the present time though they are worried about how fast it could accelerate,&quot; said Bob Savage, chief foreign exchange dealer at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;This basically makes people comfortable with the idea we will see 1.80 in dollar/mark and 130 in dollar/yen,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The G7 meeting took place on the fringes of the semi-annual gathering of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which winds up on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Besides currency rates, the policymakers from industrial and developing countries attending the IMF/World Bank are discussing a variety of other issues, including the world economic outlook and ways to aid debt-ridden poor nations.</p>
