<p>Oscar-winning actress Elizabeth Taylor, who underwent brain surgery six days ago, was discharged on Wednesday from the hospital in time for her 65th birthday on Thursday, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;She has made an excellent recovery and was sent home at 1 p.m. (PST),&quot; Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre, said.</p>
<p>Taylor's publicist Shirene Coburn said on Tuesday: &quot;Doctors are extremely pleased with her progress. She (Taylor) is in great spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>Taylor underwent delicate surgery for nearly four hours last Thursday to remove an apparently benign tumour the size of a golf ball from her brain.</p>
<p>The tumour, in the lining of her parietal lobe just behind the left ear, was detected this month during a brain scan as part of a routine physical examination.</p>
<p>The operation, originally scheduled for Feb. 17, was postponed partly because Taylor had been suffering from the flu and also because of a scheduling conflict with her surgeons.</p>
<p>Taylor also put off the surgery to attend a star-studded gala birthday party in Hollywood on Feb. 16 to benefit AIDS research, her favourite charity.</p>
