<p>Satellite broadcaster BSkyB on Wednesday reported a 26 percent increase in its first-half pre-tax profit and record second-quarter subscriber growth.</p>
<p>The company, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, said pre-tax profit rose to 133.7 million pounds ($214.4 million) from 106.3 million a year ago, meeting analysts' expectations. The number of subscribers increased by 434,000 in the last three months of 1996 to over six million in Britain and Ireland.  </p>
<p>&quot;Subscribers are switching on to Sky in record numbers,&quot; said chief executive and managing director Sam Chisholm. &quot;BSkyB is now extremely well positioned to capitalise on the introduction of digital television and the significant benefits that will flow from this new technology,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But BSkyB stopped short of saying when it would actually pioneer digital satellite television in Britain. Last week it joined forces with Carlton Communications and Granada Group to apply for digital terrestrial licences here.</p>
<p>The company said subscriber growth was likely to slow in the second half of its financial year, which runs to the end of June, as satellite dish sales and new cable connections traditionally tend to be higher in the first half.</p>
<p>BSkyB said last July that it would take a stake of up to 49 percent in DF1, Kirch Gruppe's German digital platform. BSkyB confirmed on Wednesday it was considering investments in additional German pay-TV channels. However, it said the extent of its obligations and the timing of payments have yet to be determined.
