<headline>Shanghai B shares down at noon on poor sentiment.</headline>

<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B share index slipped lower on Monday morning because of general poor sentiment as well as a fall in domestic currency A shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>A working meeting on Friday between regulators and securities firms which reaffirmed the government's moves to keep domestic investors out of the B share market helped cause the fall in the foreign curreny shares, they said.</p>
<p>The B index ended the morning down 0.45 points or 0.59 percent to 75.77 points on thin volume of 2.4 million shares worth $1.59 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;The meeting on B shares had some negative influence on investor sentiment,&quot; said an anlayst at an Asian securities firm in Shanghai. &quot;But volume is thin and everyone is waiting to see what happens.&quot;</p>
<p>B shares are technically reserved for foreign investors but many domestic investors have found a variety of loopholes to purchase the shares, sparking a government crackdown last year.</p>
<p>Sentiment was also weak following the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule last week, which removed a major postive factor supporting the market, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market seems to be starting a new bear run and investors had little interest in trading after plunges last week,&quot; said one trader with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, A shares were also hit by negative sentiment caused by an expected torrent of new share issues and talk of a further government crackdown on state firms speculating in the markets.</p>
<p>The A index fell 26.618 points or 2.20 percent to 1,184.829 points on volume of 151.541 million shares worth 1.78 billion yuan.  </p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index slumped 84.150 points or 2.20 percent to 3,739.518 points.</p>
<p>Of 45 B shares, 32 traded with 19 down, eight flat and five up.</p>
<p>Both the A and B share markets were likely to fall further in the afternoon with little positive news on the horizon until the announcement of interim results later this month and in August, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be difficult for the market to reverse the current weak performance without positive incentives,&quot; said the foreign securities firm broker.  </p>
