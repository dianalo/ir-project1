<text>
<p>The British government said on Thursday it expects the bulk of windfall payments from building societies, due to land in the summer, to be saved.</p>
<p>&quot;Latest estimates suggest that around 20 billion pounds will be paid out to the personal sector from building society conversions in 1997,&quot; the government said, in response to a Treasury Select Committee report on last November's budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The Treasury has assumed that most of this money will not be spent, at least in the short term,&quot; it said. &quot;Hence the effects on consumer spending and GDP are expected to be relatively small.</p>
<p>A host of building societies are converting into banks, quoted on the stock exchange, in the summer.</p>
<p>The Halifax, Woolwich, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock Building Societies will all shed their mutual status, while the Bristol and West Building Society will be bought by Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p>The government said much of the capital from tax exempt saving schemes, known as TESSAs, maturing over the past 18 months, had been reinvested. It expects the same to happen to the building society payments.</p>
<p>&quot;However, with such high sums involved, these payouts do represent a clear upside risk to the forecast for consumer spending, and the Treasury will monitor future developments closely.&quot;</p>
<p>The government has forecast consumer spending will grow by 4.25 percent this year.</p>
<p>It also rejected the Treasury committee's suggestion that the Private Finance Initiative, a government scheme to entice private investment into infrastructure projects, has not taken off.</p>
<p>&quot;The government does not share the committee's view that the growth of PFI is sluggish. It still expects to reach 14 billion pounds of agreed PFI deals by the end of 1998/99.</p>
