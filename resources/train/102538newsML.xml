<p>The closest race in Massachusetts ended Tuesday when the state's highest court ruled that a man who had lost his bid to be the Democratic nominee for Congress actually was the winner.</p>
<p>In a one-line ruling, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court said Norfolk County District Attorney William Delahunt was the winner of the Sept. 17 Democratic primary for the seat of Democratic Rep. Gerry Studds, retiring after 12 terms.</p>
<p>Delahunt, considered the frontrunner in polls conducted before the September primary, turned to the courts when his opponent, Philip Johnston, was declared the winner with a 206-vote margin and retained that position even after recounts in selected districts shrank his lead to 175.</p>
<p>As Johnston campaigned with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton late Friday, a Superior Court judge reviewed some 956 punch card ballots and ruled that Delahunt was the winner by 108 votes. Johnston appealed to the highest court Monday.</p>
<p>The paper ballots require holes to be punched cleanly through the card. Those in question were only partially punctured or &quot;dimpled,&quot; lawyers for Johnston argued.</p>
<p>But the five Supreme Judicial Court justices disagreed. &quot;The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although I strongly disagree with it, I accept the court's decision. I congratulate Mr. Delahunt on his victory and wish him well,&quot; Johnston said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Delahunt told reporters while campaigning in Quincy, &quot;I'm glad that it's over, but it ain't over. This is the beginning of the end and there are less then 30 days to wage a campaign that will succeed on Nov. 5 and will retain this particular seat in the Democratic column.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Democrats historically have been contentious but after our primary we heal more quickly and we're ready to move on and we're going to win this seat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The turmoil caused by Delahunt's calls for recounts and court challenges has split the state's Democrats. Several prominent Democrats including Rep. Joe Kennedy had urged Delahunt to drop his bid.</p>
<p>But after filing his suit with the high court, Johnston appeared at a Weymouth rally with Delahunt on Monday and both men urged voters to keep the seat a Democratic one.</p>
<p>As for Delahunt's Republican opponent, Edward Teague, who was also campaigning in the district, which encompasses Cape Cod and the South Shore, he said of the court victory: &quot;That means it's really important that local officials make sure that in the general election he doesn't make an effort to steal it the way he did in the primary.&quot;</p>
