<p>Arcon International Resources Plc on Monday sent its first shipment of zinc concentrate, marking a move from development into production, for the Irish midlands-based mine.</p>
<p>Chief executive Tony O'Reilly Junior said 20 years had elapsed since any company has developed a commercial zinc mine in Ireland and today's announcement marked the culmination of an 85 million Irish pound project for Kilkenny-based Arcon.</p>
<p>On current reserve estimates, O'Reilly said the Galmoy mine has a life of about 13 years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud that Arcon is the first Irish-owned company to develop a zinc mine which we believe will play a very significant role in the development of the industry in Ireland into the long-term future,&quot; O'Reilly said.</p>
<p>During the five-year period of development Arcon has undertaken a significant investment programme in the local community and more than three million Irish pounds was spent on development of infrastructure, the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the commissioning and production schedule has been running parallel to the recruitment programme which will result in a workforce of up to 200 at Galmoy.</p>
<p>Arcon has already employed 90 workers and the full number of employees will be phased in over the next three months, it said.</p>
<p>Irish energy minister Alan Dukes visited the site which officially marked the culmination of an 85 million punt project for Arcon on Monday.</p>
