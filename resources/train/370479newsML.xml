<p>Overnight interbank rates on the Egyptian pound ranged from 10-1/2 to 11 percent on Tuesday in the private sector in a slightly short market beginning to pick up pace after a long weekend, bankers said.</p>
<p>One week rates ranged from 10-1/2 to 10-3/4 percent, they said.</p>
<p>Banks have been closed for four days because the usual weekend break was followed by another two days of holiday for the Islamic feast of Eid al-Fitr.</p>
<p>Many bankers on Thursday said they did not make any deals but one dealt overnight at 10-1/4 percent and one received an offer of 11 percent. Rates on Wednesday ranged from 10-3/8 to 11-1/2.</p>
<p>Few bankers dealt one-week on Thursday but one cited a rate of 10-3/8 percent, compared with about 10-1/2 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>One banker said the Central Bank on Tuesday offered a 500 million pound repurchase which he expected would relieve the market's shortage.</p>
<p>Public sector banks maintained their minimum overnight lending rates at 10-1/2 percent.</p>
