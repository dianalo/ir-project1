<p>The fate of bankrupt Dutch planemaker Fokker seemed to be finally sealed on Monday after one of the key parties in rescue talks pulled out and even its receivers said a relaunch now looked impossible.</p>
<p>Dutch engineering group Stork, which owns the profitable Fokker aircraft maintenance and components units, announced it was no longer bound by a memorandum of understanding, signed in March as the blueprint for a possible resurrection.</p>
<p>&quot;Stork has informed the Dutch state, the Deleye investment group and the administrators that it is no longer bound by the memorandum,&quot; Fokker's receivers said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fokker adminstrators have now concluded that any chance of a restart seems definitely off the cards.&quot;</p>
<p>The memorandum was signed by all parties interested in rescuing one of Europe's oldest aviation marques -- the court-appointed receivers, the Dutch state, Stork and industrial investment group Deleye. It was designed to provide a common position for negotiations with the Malaysian government.</p>
<p>All parties had planned to complete their talks by May 1.</p>
<p>The receivers said Stork blamed its pull-out on the failure of Malaysia's state investment arm Khazanah Nasional Berhad to guarantee sufficiant financial support.</p>
<p>&quot;Stork said one of its motives was that Khazanah has said it was not willing to meet its necessary obligations together with the Dutch parties before the completion of due dilligence,&quot; the statement from the administrators said.</p>
<p>Stork, the administrators and Fokker's management team felt the minimum infrastructure needed for a successful restart was no longer present, it said.</p>
<p>The receivers have kept Fokker's factory near Amsterdam working on a handful of outstanding orders but most of the skilled workers have long-since left. Monday's statement said Fokker had almost completed building its last three aircraft.</p>
<p>The various parties have been negotiating for weeks in an attempt to salvage something from the wreckage of Fokker, which went bankrupt a year ago after majority shareholder Daimler Benz pulled the plug, saying it could no longer sustain the striken plane maker's huge financial losses.</p>
<p>The &quot;Malaysian option&quot; was widely seen as its final lifeline and when a delegation from Khazanah arrived in the Netherlands last month to view Fokker's assembly facilities and to examine the company's books, there was a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Tentative rescue plans had assumed the Malysians would invest 450 million guilders in a new Fokker, the Dutch state 475 million, Stork 175 million and Deleye 25 million.</p>
<p>But Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs Hans Wijers warned of over-optimism at the time, saying there would be no relaunch unless substantial foreign investment could be secured.</p>
<p>Malysia's emergence as a potential saviour came after a number of suitors -- from Canadians and South Koreans to Russians -- had failed to come up with viable rescue package.</p>
<p>The Fokker story took a bizarre twist in March when Saudi Arabia's billionaire Prince al-Waleed, nephew to King Fahd, was touted as interested in buying into the company.</p>
<p>But like so many other Fokker rumours, that too came to nothing and a week after the possibility surfaced the prince bought a five percent stake in Trans World Airlines Inc, the world's seventh largest air carrier.</p>
<p>Without the Malaysian deal, the plant is now expected to be closed for good this summer and the assets liquidated.</p>
