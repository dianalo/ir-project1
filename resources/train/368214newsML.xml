<title>JAPAN: TOCOM gold futures end lower, palladium up.</title>
<headline>TOCOM gold futures end lower, palladium up.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-02-10</dateline>

<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures ended lower on Monday, depressed by the yen's rebound against the dollar after the weekend Group of Seven (G7) meeting signalled a desire for currency stability, traders said.</p>
<p>All palladium futures bounced back from early lows to end at all-time highs on Monday, as a continued delay in Japan-Russia platinum talks prompted individual investors to cover their shorts, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from six yen to 23 yen per gram lower. Most-active benchmark December was off 17 yen at 1,337 yen.  </p>
<p>Spot gold edged down at $340.75/341.05 per ounce at the Tokyo close, down from the day's high of $342.85/343.15, and against $341.50/342.00 in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Activity in the bullion market was led by overseas funds.</p>
<p>&quot;Earlier in the day, after funds' short-covering lifted bullion prices, prices fell sharply as overseas funds built fresh shorts,&quot; one trading house trader said.</p>
<p>Sentiment in spot gold remained bearish. &quot;Gold prices could be weaker as physical demand in the Far East would come off after the Chinese New Year, a period in which we usually see a seasonal dip in demand,&quot; a senior metals analyst said.  </p>
<p>The most-active palladium December futures contract was up 10 yen at 524 yen.</p>
<p>There were large short positions held by private investors especially in distant months. &quot;Unless there is any progress in the delayed Japan-Russia platinum-group talks, TOCOM palladium futures will rise more, led by short-covering,&quot; one palladium trader said.</p>
<p>Platinum settled lower, tracking gold. Platinum futures ranged from eight yen to 13 yen per gram lower, with benchmark December ending down 10 yen at 1,366 yen.  Benchmark December silver was up 1.6 yen per 10 grams at 195.6 yen.</p>
