<p>* NZ bonds end weaker, bears seen running into next week  </p>
<p>* Mid-curve holds as 07/98 bond runs into short supply</p>
<p>* Bills reach attractive levels, start to find support</p>
<p>New Zealand debt securities ended the week on a bearish note, with prices continuing to fall on Friday after three days of solid weakness.</p>
<p>Bonds yields are now between 25 and 30 basis points higher than at the start of the week, pressured first by wages data which confirmed the picture of a growing economy and then by cautious comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.  </p>
<p>Dealers said New Zealand wholesale interest rates have entered new, higher ranges, and the bear sentiment looks likely to remain in place, at least in the short term, despite their relative attractiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's room for this thing to sell off a bit more, it's not looking that comfortable,&quot; said one senior dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a little bit of buying, but the underlying fear has not gone -- you've still got the Fed looking to pull the trigger, and that's not going to go away in a hurry.&quot;  </p>
<p>A weakening New Zealand dollar has not helped the debt markets and even the mid-dated maturities, the firmest part of the curve this week, were seen weaker if the Kiwi continues to slide.</p>
<p>That was despite the issue of a $100 million three-year bond from the World Bank and a $100 million four-year bond from Dresdner Finance BV overnight.</p>
<p>Dealers noted, however, that the 07/98 bond was again coming into short supply.</p>
<p>The 98s have been hard to come across in the past. &quot;There's quite a high government ownership of those,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>While demand for them was not getting out of hand at the moment, he saw it &quot;getting a little bit tighter for the next wee while.&quot;</p>
<p>Other than that, he said, rates could move higher next week. In the money market, the scenario was much the same, with yields higher at the close and a bear tone reasonably entrenched.</p>
<p>However, with the 90-day rate now up around 7.80 percent, nearly 40 points higher than at the beginning of the week, dealers said the short end was starting to find some support.</p>
<p>&quot;The TWI fell and interest rates went up, but bills found a bit of support at these levels,&quot; said one.  </p>
<p>He said the TWI was unlikely to fall much further with high yields in the short end looking rather attractive to offshore investors.</p>
<p>But the 7.55 percent technical resistance level which had capped the 90-day rate until this week was now a distant memory and dealers said the market was likely to remain in its new, higher ranges at least until the Reserve Bank's six-monthly economic projections on March 13.</p>
