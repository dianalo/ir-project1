<p>Sterling rallied over a pfennig to above 2.60 marks on Wednesday after Britain's jobless rate fell a record 95,800 to its lowest level in six years, increasing the pressure for an interest rate rise, analysts said.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected retail sales in November, up 0.7 percent month-on-month and 3.9 percent year-on-year, also fanned rate rise speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of strong consumption and tight labour markets are ingredients that will make the case for higher rates more compelling,&quot; said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major said the unemployment figures were &quot;magnificent,&quot; after they fell below two million in November for the first time in six years.</p>
<p>Against the mark, sterling jumped from around 2.5900 marks ahead of the data to a session high of 2.6020. At 1228 GMT the pound was trading at 2.6007/17 marks against 2.5840/51 in Europe late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sterling also climbed against the dollar, but less strongly. Sterling rose from around $1.6700 before the data to a session high of $1.6751 after their release. At 1229 GMT sterling/dollar was trading at $1.6745/55 against $1.6710/20 in late dealings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term, the outlook is for the pound to push higher. It's becoming very clear that there's a difference between the UK and essentially everybody else in terms of interest rates,&quot; said Andrew Snowball, treasury economist at Cooperative Bank.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke was quick to react, however, saying inflation pressures in the British economy remained quite reasonable and the latest set of data did not make higher rates inevitable.</p>
<p>But sterling could come under pressure if the Chancellor fails to tighten monetary policy, said analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;...I think the Chancellor will really miss the boat if he doesn't raise rates at the next (monetary) meeting in January,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America.</p>
<p>Average earnings for October, which matched forecasts, and softer than expected unit wage cost rises could, however, be used as ammunition to fight calls for tighter rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>Underlying October average earnings increased 4.0 percent, as in September, while wage costs for the three months to October rose 4.6 percent against forecasts of 5.1 percent.</p>
<p>Some also said political concerns stood in the way of an imminent tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Clarke, regarding the interest rate pressures, will he feel happy putting up interest rates just before the election campaign starts?,&quot; said Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at SocieteGenerale Strauss Turnbull.</p>
<p>Hilliard also said a rise in rates would further hamper the manufacturing sector as it pushed the pound even higher. &quot;If sterling stays at this level, then it is going to keep manufacturing weak for some considerable time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that the drop in November unemployment, the largest fall on record, coincided with a change in the way the benefits system is calculated. The difference could account for around 30,000 people.</p>
<p>&quot;When you take out the special effects they (government) are citing, you're still looking at a fall of 70,000 in unemployment and that's evidence of a very significant tightening in the labour market,&quot; said Leo Doyle, economist at Kleinwort Benson.</p>
