<headline>U.S. says credible massacre reports in East Zaire.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-29</dateline>

<p>The United States said Tuesday there were increasingly credible reports of massacres in rebel-held territory in Zaire and warned the rebels they were responsible for the fate of refugees on land they occupy.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately now there is a growing body of credible evidence that massacres have taken place in rebel-held territory,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very serious development, because the rebel alliance must bear responsibility for what happens to the innocent people in the regions that they occupy,&quot; Burns told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Earlier, the United Nations refugee agency in Geneva said it had &quot;increasingly shocking reports&quot; of killings of refugees around Kisangani and other areas of eastern Zaire captured by the rebels since last October. The refugees, estimated to number up to 100,000, are mainly Rwandan Hutus.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Bill Richardson, who is mediating between Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila, is due in Kisangani Wednesday to look into the refugee situation.</p>
<p>Burns' statement did not blame the rebels directly for the massacres, but said the refugees had not been protected from &quot;the whims of soldiers who are patrolling in the area&quot;.</p>
<p>Burns called on the rebel alliance to give full access to suspected killing sites to the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Zaire, Robert Garreton, who arrives there next Sunday.</p>
<p>U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata will visit Washington Wednesday to discuss the situation, he added.</p>
<p>Richardson announced Tuesday that Mobutu and Kabila had agreed to meet face-to-face. The meeting is expected to take place in the next few days on a South African naval vessel off the coast of Zaire.</p>
<p>Burns said that Richardson, who met Mobutu in Kinshasa and Kabila in Lubumbashi Tuesday, would return to the Zairean capital after his trip to Kisangani for more talks with Mobutu about the U.S. goal of a transition to democracy in Zaire.</p>
<p>Burns repeated U.S. assertions that &quot;the era of Mobutu is over&quot; and it was time for him to &quot;face reality&quot;, but again stopped short of saying Mobutu should step down immediately.</p>
<p>Asked if Mobutu should quit at the beginning or the end of a transition to democracy, the U.S. spokesman said: &quot;That's a decision he alone can make.&quot;</p>
<p>Burns also said there was &quot;no basis right now&quot; for the United States to take action against assets held by Mobutu outside Zaire.</p>
