<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, whose government has been under severe pressure over its handling of the economy, said on Friday that he was prepared to continue the fight over his government's programme.</p>
<p>At an extraordinary news conference, Klaus also said that Interior Minister designate Petr Necas, nominated in a cabinet reshuffle earlier this week, had withdrawn his candidacy and that President Vaclav Havel had rejected the resignation of Interior Minister Jan Ruml, and Ruml accepted the decision.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's currency situation, and consequently the whole economic situation, has a solution. It requires an energetic and consistent stance and I am ready to proceed this way,&quot; Klaus said in a statement which was not followed by questions.</p>
<p>The Czech crown has been under intense pressure amid an economic downturn, forcing the central bank from Tuesday to float the currency. The ruling three-party coalition led by Klaus announced an emergency austerity packaage on Wednesday along with a sweeping cabinet reshuffle.</p>
<p>&quot;I am resolutely repeating that I am ready to take on the political fight over these steps on the floor of parliament, and that I am not ready to run away from the fight,&quot; Klaus said.</p>
<p>Earlier, opposition leader Milos Zeman of the Social Democrats said his party would seek a vote of no confidence in the centre-right government in a parliamentary session beginning on July 1, because the austerity package marked a major change in government policy.</p>
