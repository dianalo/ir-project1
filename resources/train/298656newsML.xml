<headline>IPE Brent closes weak, eyes on NYMEX crude.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures ended the day weaker after a session of thin trading and traders said February NYMEX crude's failure to fall below the key level of $26.00 a barrel had prevented a large further slippage.</p>
<p>February Brent closed 21 cents a barrel down on the day at $24.36. February gas oil earlier ended its session $4.50 down at $226.25 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;All eyes were on WTI (NYMEX crude,)&quot; one broker said. &quot;If we had fallen through $26.00 then it could have fallen quite quickly.</p>
<p>NYMEX February crude stood at $26.08 at 2019 GMT after earlier touching $26.00.</p>
<p>Traders said that a perception that the recent cold snap had not eaten into European oil stocks as much as had been earlier expected had contributed to gas oil's weakness.</p>
<p>January gas oil expired at midday with a delivery requirement of 261,700 tonnes.</p>
<p>Dealers said that warmer weather forecast for Europe had largely been factored into prices and the energy complex was weaker more as a result of technical factors than anything else.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather is looking warmer but that has really been priced in to the market,&quot; an IPE floor dealer said.</p>
