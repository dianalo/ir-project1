<p>Italian Alberto Tomba took to his bed with flu after the first leg of a men's World Cup slalom on Sunday, his manager said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's got flu and he's gone to bed,&quot; said his manager, Giorgio Sgorlon. &quot;He feels the most important thing for him to do is to get better for the next giant slalom&quot;, on Tuesday in Adelboden, Switzerland.</p>
<p>World champion Tomba, who has had a difficult start to the season, is looking forward to shining on home snow in next month's world championships in Sestriere.</p>
<p>The triple Olympic gold medallist hesitated to come to the French Alps resort of Chamonix at all after a flare-up of pain in the wrist which he injured in a fall last October forced him to halt training in Italy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tomba clocked the second fastest time in the first leg of 58.74 seconds. The fastest time of 57.58 seconds was set by Austrian Thomas Sykora, who has won three and finished second in the four previous slaloms this season.</p>
