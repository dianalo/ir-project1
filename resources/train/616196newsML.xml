<p>Namibia's ruling SWAPO is set to use a party congress this week to urge its leader, President Sam Nujoma, to agree to a third term in office even though it means changing the constitution, party sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The possibility of a third term for the man who led Namibian freedom fighters and became president on independence in 1990 has been widely debated in recent months, but so far Nujoma has remained silent on the issue and on a possible successor.</p>
<p>But SWAPO members and affiliated organisations in the sparsely populated southern African country, administered by apartheid South Africa until 1990, have been advocating changing the constitution to allow a president to take up a third term.</p>
<p>The sources said this was likely to become the official party line at the four-day congress from Wednesday in the capital Windhoek of the former liberation movement, the South West Africa People's Organisation.</p>
<p>The SWAPO Elders Council, its Youth League, the Mine Workers Union of Namibia and Prime Minister Hage Geingob -- one of the favoured candidates to succeed Nujoma -- have publicly supported a third term for Nujoma after the 1999 elections.</p>
<p>They argue Nujoma has led well, as liberation movement chief and then as president, and that he needs to keep his position to avoid conflict among Namibia's 11 ethnic groups.</p>
<p>SWAPO has more than two-thirds of seats in parliament and thus the majority needed to change the constitution.</p>
<p>Critics question the wisdom of changing the constitution for the sake of one individual, saying this could set a dangerous precedent and put democracy at risk.</p>
