<title>USA: IMM currencies end up as dollar sags pre-weekend.</title>
<headline>IMM currencies end up as dollar sags pre-weekend.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-18</dateline>

<p>IMM currency futures ended higher as the dollar sagged below key 1.80 marks and 116 yen heading into the weekend.</p>
<p>A sharp sell-off in the U.S. stock market, pre-weekend dollar profit-taking and a growing U.S. international trade gap all took some pressure off of currencies. Many had plumbed lows this week as the dollar surpassed key resistance in marks and yen.</p>
<p>September marks and Swiss francs edged up from near contract lows in moderate early trading. But action turned quiet by afternoon, and currencies ended off their highs.  </p>
<p>Traders said a French bank affiliate bought 1,000 September Canada contracts on the close, and noted offers in Aussie dollars.</p>
<p>Overall, they said the last two hours of trade were uneventful as most contracts drifted from their highs in thin trade.</p>
<p>&quot;We pulled some air out from inside the balloon,&quot; an IMM currency futures trader said. Many saw currency gains Friday as a minor technical adjustment after recent steep dollar gains.</p>
<p>Action whipsawed earlier in the day.  </p>
<p>The U.S. May trade gap rose 17 percent to $10.23 billion, versus a forecast for a $9.18 billion deficit, and the U.S.-Japan gap narrowed 25 percent to $3.63 billion.</p>
<p>September yen futures dipped to their daily low after the trade data, but quickly recovered.</p>
<p>Later, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey was reported at a record 106.4, up from 104.5 in June and higher than the 104.6 forecast.</p>
<p>Treasury bonds extended their losses after the survey, stocks slid, and currency futures turned higher.  </p>
<p>Late in the session, German Finance Minister Theo Waigel warned that political debate about the euro was unsettling for currency markets, and said an EMU delay would mean turbulence and less German growth.</p>
<p>Speculation continued about whether the German central bank will be tempted to intervene in the dollar's recent steep rise versus the mark. One analyst said central bank intervention was now unlikely until dollar/mark pierces 1.90.</p>
<p>Mark weakness early had been tied to earlier comments from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who said recent dollar strength against the mark was not &quot;earth-shaking.&quot;  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, traders said next week's U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and French budget would be key currency market stimuli.</p>
<p>At the close, September yen futures were up $0.000025 at $0.008710, marks rose $0.0003 at $0.5598, Swiss francs rose $0.0027 at $0.6817, sterling rose $0.0046 at $1.6736, Canadian dollars rose $0.0014 at $0.7298, Australian dollars rose $0.0048 at $0.7429 and Mexican pesos fell $0.000250 at $0.123750.</p>
