<title>SWITZERLAND: SNB's Gehrig warns against excessive monetary ease.</title>
<headline>SNB's Gehrig warns against excessive monetary ease.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-05-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss National Bank board member Bruno Gehrig said Switzerland could not remedy basic structural problems facing the economy by relaxing monetary policy excessively, a step he said would only create more problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Structural problems cannot be solved with a mass of money, on the contrary,&quot; he said in the text of a speech to be delivered at an economic seminar in Altstaetten.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot imagine any more unfavourable conditions for the structural challenge than a scenario in which we would loosen excessively now only to have to battle an unacceptable rise in inflation in around two years' time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This would be &quot;a battle with rapidly rising interest rates, an inversion of the yield curve and a home-made real rise in the franc,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A text of his speech was released in Zurich.</p>
<p>Gehrig said Switzerland as a place to do business faced challenges because of its high prices, expensive and inflexible labour rules and the past dearth of competition. The tax burden was relatively good but state finances still needed work, he said.</p>
<p>Switzerland was not in danger if it set priorities correctly and without illusions and took the proper steps, he added, noting it would be important to clarify Swiss ties to the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need is more confidence and more entrpreneurial courage in a Swiss landscape that has sunken to unrealistic depths after six years of economic disappointment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Switzerland as a place to do business is much better than its current reputation.&quot;</p>
