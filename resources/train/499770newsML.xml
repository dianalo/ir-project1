<p>Japan hopes an agreement will be reached soon with the United States in their port dispute, Vice Transport Minister Minoru Toyoda said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Although there were still disagreements, there has been progress and he was optimistic an agreement would be reached soon, Toyoda was quoted as saying by a Transport Ministry spokesman.</p>
<p>Earlier a ministry official told reporters that negotiators were in the final stages of preparing a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be areas in which there will be agreement and may there be areas in which there will be no agreement,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working towards having the sanctions averted, and if they are averted then we would consider it a good result even if only a partial agreement was reached,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States, angry at what it says are costly and discriminatory Japanese waterfront practices, has said it will impose $100,000 charge on Japanese ships each time they enter a U.S. port from abroad.</p>
<p>The sanctions are to go into effect from Monday.</p>
<p>Japan has admitted that its port practices need reform but is seeking to have the sanctions scrapped or at least postponed, after an interim agreement was reached between foreign and domestic industry bodies to work on a solution by the end of July.</p>
