<p>Hong Kong's business sector on Thursday backed plans by the territory's future leader, Tung Chee-hwa, to curb political freedoms after Britain hands the colony back to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposals are not more restrictive than those imposed by some cities in the USA, Canada and Australia, as well as in Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Korea, and they are more liberal than many of these,&quot; James Tien, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy groups fiercely oppose Tung's proposals. But the chamber supported the &quot;main thrust&quot; of his plan to restrict the right to protest and a ban on foreign donations to local political groups.</p>
<p>Another key business lobby, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, also issued a statement backing Tung's plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The Federation also believes that freedom is not absolute. It feels that if everyone is given the right and freedom to act in accordance with his own free will without regard for other people's freedom and without any sort of balance and social harmony, social stability will inevitably be affected,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's biggest pro-China political party also fell in behind the plan on Wednesday, but it proposed clearer definition of concepts such as &quot;national security&quot; and &quot;foreign organisations&quot;.</p>
<p>China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 under a 1984 treaty that allows the territory quasi-autonomy as a capitalist entity for a further 50 years.</p>
<p>But China has been preparing to roll back a string of reforms introduced by Governor Chris Patten to expand democracy and get rid of draconian colonial laws limiting civil rights. China plans to reverse the changes.</p>
<p>As the business lobby added their support to Tung on Thursday, Patten renewed his attacks on the curbs during a regular question session in the Legislative Council. He said the curbs were unneeded and fanned anxiety in the community.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't understand what's the purpose of all this is,&quot; he told the council. &quot;It is conceded, I think, by some of the authors of the document that Hong Kong is an incredibly stable, moderate, balanced place.&quot;</p>
<p>None of Hong Kong's laws in these areas contradicted the territory's post-colonial constitution, Patten added.</p>
