<p>European low-sulphur straight-run offers moved up slightly on Wednesday on the back of solid crude futures and with most of July's material sold, traders said.</p>
<p>They said few sellers were left on the market after a refiner sold a 25,000-tonne cargo to an end user at a price at the higher end of the quotes late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One seller said he was at the $107 mark for 0.5-0.7 pct sulphur material while others were at $106 a tonne, or $1 up on a day earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;With crude up 40 to 50 cents (yesterday) it's a natural progression for straight-run to go higher,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Also avails are low, most of the July material is gone now and its mid-month,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>Russian high sulphur straight run was steady to a little weaker with offers for three cargoes at two means plus $4.50/$5.50, compared with a deal on Tuesday at the higher price.</p>
<p>Traders said buying interest was weaker as refiners who cut runs recently have done most of their buying for now.</p>
