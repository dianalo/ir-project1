<p>Consumer prices barely rose in May for a third straight month, restrained by the biggest drop in gasoline prices in six years, as well as tumbling costs for tobacco and airline tickets, the government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent last month, the same as in April and March, the Labor Department said. The report gives the Federal Reserve added breathing room to refrain from raising interest rates when central bank policy-makers meet July 1-2.  </p>
<p>The tame CPI -- following last Friday's report showing that wholesale prices fell a fifth straight month in May -- offers still more evidence the economy can grow at a healthy clip without throwing off inflationary sparks.</p>
<p>After stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the core CPI rose 0.2 percent last month after increasing 0.3 percent in April. Economists had expected the overall and core CPI to rise 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>So far this year the CPI has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 percent, less than half the 3.3 percent increase recorded for all of 1996.  </p>

<p>The tame CPI -- following last Friday's report showing that wholesale prices fell a fifth consecutive month in May -- offers still more evidence the economy can grow at a healthy clip without throwing off inflationary sparks.</p>
<p>After stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the &quot;core&quot; CPI rose 0.2 percent last month after gaining 0.3 percent in April. Economists had expected the overall and core CPI to rise 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>So far this year the CPI has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 percent, less than half the 3.3 percent increase recorded for all of 1996.</p>
<p>The bullish inflation news comes as the economy shows signs of a slowdown. That is considered good news for Fed officials worried that the torrid 5.8 percent growth rate in the first quarter of the year would unleash inflation.</p>
<p>The CPI showed that food prices rose 0.4 percent last month after falling 0.2 percent in April. Fruit prices fell 0.2 percent, but vegetable prices shot up 5.9 percent.</p>
<p>Energy prices declined 2.4 percent after falling 1.5 percent. The drop in energy prices was the largest since a 2.6 percent decrease in March 1991. Gasoline prices tumbled 4.1 percent, the biggest slide since a 4.6 percent drop in March 1991.</p>
<p>Airline fares fell 1.3 percent while automobile finance charges declined 2.5 percent, the biggest drop since a 2.8 percent slide in February 1992.</p>
<p>Tobacco prices fell 0.5 percent after rising 2.4 percent in April.</p>
