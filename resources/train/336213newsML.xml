<p>China's total sugar imports in 1997 could be as much as two million tonnes, much higher than the official forecast of 690,000 tonnes, sugar traders in Hong Kong said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to estimate demand for China, but we expected sugar imports of between 1.5 and two million tonnes for 1997, including the government to government agreements,&quot; said a sugar source at an international trading firm's Hong Kong office.</p>
<p>Some traders pitched China's 1997 sugar imports at slightly more than one million tonnes, similar to the 1.25 million tonnes imported in 1996 as reported by China's customs.</p>
<p>China planned to import about 690,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997, the official People's Daily Overseas Edition said on Monday, quoting a decision at a planning meeting of China light industry producers.</p>
<p>About 350,000 tonnes of sugar would be imported from Cuba, and another 340,000 tonnes from other producing countries, the report said.</p>
<p>Trade estimates of China's imports from Cuba under a government agreement tallied with the official figure of 350,000 tonnes, which fell within the traders' forecast range of 320,000 to 400,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Sugar industry sources said the 340,000 tonnes to be imported from other producing countries would most likely come from Thailand and Australia.</p>
<p>Whatever the volume of sugar imports, little was likely to happen before the second half of 1997, sugar dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't happen before the second half of this year,&quot; a Hong Kong sugar trader said.</p>
<p>China's Ministry of Internal Trade has issued an urgent circular to government sugar firms nationwide to buy sugar to boost reserves, support output and stabilise the market, the official China Daily said last week.</p>
<p>China's sugar prices have been steadily sliding as a substantial new crop came onto the market, with white sugar in southern producing areas now at 3,800 yuan ($458) per tonne, compared to 3,900 yuan per tonne a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>World raw sugar prices were expected to test a low of nine cents per pound in 1997, according to an annual review by commission house Refco.</p>
<p>The lower levels could trigger China's known need to buy sugar sometime in 1997, the Refco report said.</p>
