<p>Cellular phone firm Pilipino Telephone Corporation is seen posting a 19 percent rise in 1996 net income to 978.76 million pesos ($37 million) despite a problem over fraudulent calls, a Reuters poll of brokers showed.</p>
<p>In 1995, Piltel, which is a unit of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co, posted net income of 822.075 million pesos.</p>
<p>The poll of seven brokerages completed on Tuesday showed that in 1997, Piltel's profits were expected to increase by 48 percent to 1.446 billion pesos ($55 million), mainly on account of an increase in its subscriber base.</p>
<p>Piltel has been troubled by fraudulent calls made by organised groups using sophisticated cloning devices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still expansion in its cellular subscriber base in 1996 and the only thing that slowed down the company's revenue generation was the fact that they had this cloning problem,&quot; said Ricardo Puig, analyst at Peregrine Securities.</p>
<p>Last November, Piltel acknowledged it was the victim of cloning that would mean a 300 million peso ($11.4 million) loss in 1996.</p>
<p>The cellular firm had to downgrade its earnings forecast projection to 1.0 billion pesos ($38 million) from the original 1.16 billion pesos ($44 million) due to the illegal calls. Most analysts followed suit and lowered their earnings forecasts.</p>
<p>Analysts said Piltel's subscriber base would widen from 202,000 in 1995 to between 395,000 and 430,000 in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Cloning losses is now down to normal levels and will taper further towards the end of the year. They are starting fresh in 1997 and there's really a lot of demand out there for cell phones,&quot; said Gina Roa-Dipaling of Philippine Asia Equity.</p>
<p>But not all analysts were convinced that Piltel's cloning problems were over.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have to wait and see as to what is the actual revenue opportunity loss per month of Piltel now that most of the anti-fraud measures are in place,&quot; said Alexis Cabel, analyst at Angping Securities.</p>
<p>Piltel is expected to release its earnings for 1996 by the end of the month or by the first week of February.</p>
<p>Puig said the company might see some earnings contribution from its fixed line operations in 1997. As a cellular phone operator, Piltel is mandated to install 400,000 telephone lines in exchange for its cellular phone permit.</p>
<p>Analysts said Piltel would also have to reckon with stiffer competition from other cellular phone firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Smart is posing the biggest threat to Piltel because of its low pricing,&quot; said Helen Alvarez, research head at All Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Smart Communications Co Inc, a unit of Metro Pacific Corp, is planning an initial public offering.</p>
<p>Analysts said Express Telecommunications Co Inc (Extelcom) may also provide competition with the buy-in of Benpres Holdings Corp into Marifil Holdings Corp, which has a 40 percent stake in Extelcom.</p>
<p>Globe Telecom, a joint venture of Ayala Corp and Singapore Telecommunications Co Ltd, although hurt last year by subscription fraud, is expected to lessen its losses this year with an overhauling of its billing system in 1996.</p>
