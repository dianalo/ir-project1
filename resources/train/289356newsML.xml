<p>Confidence in the Federal Reserve has risen a lot over the past decade and a half and the bank should not squander its credibility by taking a chance on inflation, Stanford University economist Michael Boskin said.</p>
<p>Boskin, who chaired a congressionally appointed panel that concluded the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) was overstated, praised the Fed under the chairmanship of Alan Greenspan, crediting it with engineering a &quot;soft landing&quot; for the economy.</p>
<p>The strategy resulted in a second round of disinflation following drastic action by Greenspan's predecessor, Paul Volcker, to bring inflation down from the double digits.</p>
<p>&quot;My own personal opinion is that the Fed has been gaining substantial credibility -- gradually -- ever since, and that this is enormously valuable social capital that should not be readily squandered,&quot; Boskin said in prepared remarks to an American Economic Association luncheon this weekend.</p>
<p>Boskin's commission, which delivered its final report on the CPI last month, concluded that the index overstated inflation by 1.1 percent -- a problem with major implications for the federal budget since the CPI is used to index tax brackets and costly programs like Social Security.</p>
<p>In his remarks to the luncheon, Boskin pointed out that the finding also had implications for efforts to keep inflation low and stable, saying the panel's research would suggest that inflation is now running at around two percent, rather than the roughly three percent rate of the official CPI.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus, if the inflation rate accelerates from 3 to 5 percent, it is really accelerating from 2 to 4 percent,&quot; Boskin said. He added that did not mean the Fed should be any less vigilant.</p>
<p>&quot;Except under extremely unusual and rare circumstances, I would expect the Fed to be as diligent against a rise in inflation from 2 to 4 percent as one from 3 to 5 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He disagreed with a view shared by some analysts that with inflation low right now, the Fed should use the opportunity to test how unemployment can go.</p>
<p>&quot;We've tried that in the past and it has caused serious problems, wreaked enormous hardship, which took more than a decade to work out of the economy,&quot; Boskin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Low and stable inflation has been hard won at substantial cost, and the Fed's credibility should not be squandered,&quot; he concluded.</p>
