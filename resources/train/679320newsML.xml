<headline>U.S. blue chips weak, tech stocks draw interest.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. blue chip stocks were broadly weaker Monday as a bout of profit-taking ate into the stock market's recent gains, but the technology sector continued to draw buyers.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 57 points to 7739, while the Nasdaq composite was up 1.90 at 1449.</p>
<p>Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray Co, said Compaq Computer Corp's agreement to acquire Tandem Computers Inc in a stock swap valued at $3 billion had added life to technology stocks.  </p>
<p>&quot;The deal has provided some verification that these values (on technology stocks) are not exorbitant,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tandem was up 6-1/4 at 21-1/4 and Compaq was off 1-3/4 at 105-1/8.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the broader market needs to correct from its recent series of run-ups.</p>
<p>On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing issues by a seven-to-five ratio.</p>
<p>Dow component Philip Morris Cos Inc fell 1-3/8 to 44-1/4 in active trade following news of the tobacco settlement.</p>
