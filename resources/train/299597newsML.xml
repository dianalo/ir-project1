<p>Canada hopes to boost trade with India through high-technology exports, particularly telecommunication equipment, following a telephone service contract won by Bell Canada, Canadian officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We..see telecom equipment as an area of huge potential,&quot; Canadian High Commissioner Stanley Gooch told a news conference addressed by Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who was in Calcutta to attend a business conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bell-Tata communications project in Andhra Pradesh will be a major factor in boosting Canadian investment,&quot; Axworthy told the conference. Canada, the ninth largest foreign investor in India, hoped to move up the ladder, he said.</p>
<p>Bell Canada and India's Tata group have jointly won a licence to provide telephone services in southern Andhra Pradesh state.</p>
<p>Axworthy said Indian Communications Minister Beni Prasad Varma had assured him of India's decision to pass a law to empower a telecommunications regulator.</p>
<p>&quot;The minister indicated that there would be legislation dealing with a regulatory authority,&quot; Axworthy said.</p>
<p>The Tata-Bell consortium had joined other licence winners in opposing what they termed as high charges for private companies to connect to the network of the state-run Department of Telecommunications (DoT), India's telephone monopoly.</p>
<p>They were also concerned about what some critics saw as uneven competition with the DoT without an independent regulator in place.</p>
<p>India opened up telephone services to private firms under an economic reform programme launched in 1991.</p>
<p>Gooch said he expected Canada to export environmental technology and aircraft in addition to traditional exports like newsprint, wood pulp and fertilisers. A turnaround was expected in newsprint exports after a slowdown in 1995, he added.</p>
<p>Canada expected India to export more computer software to add to traditional exports of textiles, jewellery and pharmaceuticals, Gooch said.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade totalled Canadian $ 1.0 billion ($750 milion) in 1995, Gooch said adding India had a surplus of C$100 million ($75 million).</p>
<p>Canada will open diplomatic offices in the Indian cities of Calcutta and Chandigarh, Canadian officials said. Canada already has a trade office in Madras, in addition to its high commission (embassy) in New Delhi.</p>
