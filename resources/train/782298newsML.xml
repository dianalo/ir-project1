<p>---------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar opened weaker at C$1.3835 (US$0.7228) in light trading on Wednesday after a round of early morning selling by U.S. investors pushed the currency to the top of its range, traders said. * They said further stop-loss selling could weaken the Canadian dollar past the key C$1.3850 (US$0.7220) level.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the Canadian would continue to trade in a weak range ahead of the release of Canadian employment data due on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We need another good employment report to get it (the Canadian dollar) moving again, but that could be tough,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Soft debt markets also continued to weigh on the Canadian dollar on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds opened a touch weaker for the third session in a row as the 30-year long bond fell C$0.12 to C$119.97 to yield 6.478 percent.  </p>
<p>Overseas, attention was focused on the surging U.S. dollar, which nudged closer to the psychologically important 1.90 German marks level and renewed speculation that the Bundesbank would have to raise short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/yen was bid overnight, but all eyes are on Germany,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar was also supported against the Japanese yen after Japanese Vice Finance Minister Takeshi Komura said the Bank of Japan's low interest rate policy was having positive economic effects in Japan.  </p>
<p>Komura's comments reinforced the belief that the Bank of Japan would leave interest rates untouched in the coming months, and further boosted the appeal of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar benefited from the strength of the U.S. dollar. On the crosses, the Canadian dollar climbed to 86.29 Japanese yen from Tuesday's close of 85.69 and jumped to 1.3623 marks from Tuesday's 1.3479 marks.</p>
