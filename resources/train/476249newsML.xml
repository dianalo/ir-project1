<headline>Kronos sees Q2 earnings below expectations.</headline>
<dateline>WALTHAM, Mass. 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kronos Inc Monday said it expects second-quarter earnings to be below Wall Street projections.</p>
<p>The First Call consensus is $0.35 a share.</p>
<p>Second-quarter revenues are projected to increase over the same quarter last year by about 18 percent to 20 percent, consistent with the average revenue growth the company has reported over the last six quarters, but lower than planned for the quarter, the company said.  </p>
<p>During the second quarter ending in March, the company continued to make substantial investments in engineering, its new government and education business division, and its international distribution.</p>
<p>These investments, combined with lower than planned revenues, will cause earnings to be below Street projections, Kronos said.</p>
<p>At the beginning of fiscal year 1997, the company anticipated revenue growth rates in excess of recent historical rates, both because of the expected demand for its new client/server product line and the additional revenue from its government and education division. However, the sales cycle for both second quarter results will be announced April 16.</p>
<p>Kronos designs, manufactures, and markets client/server-based time and attendance systems, workforce management systems, and shop floor data collection systems.</p>
