<title>NORWAY: Norway shares edge up with Wall Street.</title>
<headline>Norway shares edge up with Wall Street.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1997-05-06</dateline>

<p>Norwegian shares were up on Tuesday following the overnight rally in New York which drove Wall Street to a record close, but trade in Oslo was cautious, dealers said.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total share index rose 0.31 percent to 1,105.28 points in heavy turnover of 1.72 billion crowns.</p>
<p>But dealers noted more than 600 million crowns worth of shares were traded in branded-goods conglomerate Orkla as foreign investors took tax positions prior to the paying of dividend.  </p>
<p>&quot;Foreigers pay tax on dividend so they sell stock against an option to buy it back afterwards,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Otherwise there is relatively low liquidity in the market. It seems Norwegian investors are on the sidelines while foreigners have been net sellers most of the year so far,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will be pretty calm thorough the summer and we can only hope that more money will flow into the market in the autumn.&quot;</p>
<p>The Oslo Bourse is one of the smallest in Europe.</p>
