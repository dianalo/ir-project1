<p>Former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, convicted of fraud in a Whitewater related criminal case, was discharged Wednesday from hospital one week after receiving a liver transplant.</p>
<p>Tucker, who succeeded President Clinton as governor of Arkansas until his criminal conviction, suffers a degenerative disease of his intestinal tract.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Tucker is in good condition but he'll remain in the Rochester area for six to eight weeks so his doctors can monitor his condition,&quot; said Jackie Stevemer-Bakken, a spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Stevemer-Bakken said Tucker had authorised her to say there had been &quot;some rejection&quot; of the new organ by his system but that his body's natural response to a donor liver was being controlled through medication.</p>
<p>Tucker was convicted in May, 1996 of fraud and conspiracy in the first jury trial to result from an investigation of the personal and political finances of President and Mrs. Clinton.</p>
<p>Convicted in the same case with Tucker were James B. McDougal and his former wife Susan, who were partners with the Clintons in a failed Arkansas real estate project during the 1970s. The Clintons were not charged in the case and the president testified for the defence on videotape.</p>
<p>Tucker resigned the governorship a few weeks after his conviction. A federal judge declined to impose a prison sentence against Tucker in light of his medical condition, but fined him hundreds of thousands of dollars and placed him on probation for four years.</p>
<p>Tucker and two former business associates face a second Whitewater trial later this year.</p>
