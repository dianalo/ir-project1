<p>A shortage of trained staff, the slow pace of banking reform and vestiges of state economic planning are holding up Shanghai's development as China's financial capital, bankers and scholars said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They were speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper of Japan on the development of Shanghai and how it will be hit by the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;By the year 2000, Shanghai will be a national financial market for real,&quot; said one western banker. &quot;The market system is in the process of being established. It is already a national centre for some things.&quot;</p>
<p>These include trading in stocks, metals, short-term capital and foreign exchange, although the forex market particularly is tightly regulated by the central bank.</p>
<p>Long-term investment funding in China is not decided by the market but assigned by the central bank, one of the main legacies of the state plan it uses to regulate the economy.</p>
<p>Kensuke Koga, chairman of Nisshin Steel Co, said Shanghai must improve its education system and train more skilled personnel to become a financial centre.</p>
<p>Fan Gang, a professor at the China Academy of Social Sciences, said financial reform had lagged behind reforms in other sectors, such as manufacturing, where the non-state sector accounted for a large portion of output.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is to set up private or shareholding commercial banks not owned by the state, investment funds and different kinds of financial institutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Without such a base of private capital and proper market management, opening China's capital market to foreigners could lead to their reaping a huge profit and market chaos, he said.</p>
<p>Currently, foreigners are banned from entering China's local capital markets, except for a limited number of shares denominated in foreign currency on its two stock markets.</p>
<p>All the speakers said that Hong Kong had nothing to fear from Shanghai's development as a financial centre.</p>
<p>&quot;Shanghai needs 20 to 30 years to reach the current level of Hong Kong,&quot; said Wang Zhan, director of the Shanghai City government Development and Research centre. &quot;The two are not competing at the same level.</p>
<p>&quot;It will need about 10 years for the renminbi (yuan) to be convertible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Shanghai was the biggest international commercial, banking and manufacturing city in East Asia, far dwarfing Hong Kong, whose growth as a financial centre began only after the communist takeover of mainland China in 1949.</p>
<p>China has set the end of 1996 as the time to make the yuan convertible under the current account but has given no timetable for full convertibility.</p>
<p>Foreign banks in China are not allowed to do business in yuan although a few are expected to be given licences to do limited yuan business in Shanghai before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Wang said that giving yuan licences to foreign banks would start slowly, as with many reforms in China.</p>
<p>He sees Shanghai as the natural home for markets not only for capital, stocks and foreign exchange but also insurance, gold and futures.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government decides to develop the futures market, then Shanghai will become like Chicago, setting prices for the whole nation,&quot; he said.</p>
