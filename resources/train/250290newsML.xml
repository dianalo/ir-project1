<title>USA: Republicans seize Texas Senate after 125 years.</title>
<headline>Republicans seize Texas Senate after 125 years.</headline>
<dateline>DALLAS 1996-12-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Republican Party seized control of Texas' Senate Tuesday for the first time in 125 years by winning a run-off Senate race.</p>
<p>Republican candidate Robert Duncan received 57 percent of the vote to top Democratic rival David Langston in their runoff in a Senate district in west Texas. The two had led five other candidates in the first round of voting Nov. 5 but neither managed to win a clear majority, forcing a second round of voting.</p>
<p>Duncan's run-off victory gives the Republican Party 16 of the 31 seats in the state Senate, its first majority since the troubled era of Reconstruction at the end of the Civil War.</p>
<p>The Republicans' historic victory could quickly change the balance of power in the state capital of Austin and help Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican, push through legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;I do believe it will be easier to get a conservative agenda through the state Senate in the long run,&quot; Bush said last week on a campaign swing through west Texas in support of Duncan.</p>
<p>Texas was for decades a Democratic stronghold but, as across much of the South, Republicans have made steady gains in recent years.</p>
<p>Democrats will still control Texas' House of Representatives, albeit with a smaller majority, but Republican leaders said their new majority in the state Senate will boost their hopes of pushing through conservative legislation on issues ranging from taxes to abortion.</p>
