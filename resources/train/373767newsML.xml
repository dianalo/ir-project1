<p>Egypt and the European Union, at talks in Brussels last week, edged close to a partnership agreement providing for free trade in services and manufactured goods, the Egyptian negotiator said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gamal Bayyoumi told Reuters the European negotiators had stopped talking about traditional trade flows and said they could offer new quotas for Egypt's agricultural exports to Europe -- the main bone of contention in the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Now they have realised that traditional flows of trade are a silly thing to talk about. They mentioned that they can propose new (quota) figures. Now we can talk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed that they could read the political message and they said they have a more flexible stance. They started to talk more sense, even if it's not enough,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Egypt is pressing for easier access to European Union (EU) markets for Egyptian foodstuffs, especially rice and potatoes.</p>
<p>The EU, hamstrung by the Common Agricultural Policy, has previously argued for quotas that reflect the historical level of Egyptian exports. Egypt says these are based on a time when it traded mainly with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Bayyoumi said he had three days of talks with Enrico Cioffi, director of external relations at the European Commission, and representatives of all 15 EU member states.</p>
<p>The Egyptian diplomat had already dismissed the previous quota proposals by the EU. &quot;I gave them a flat no (in December). It was a kind of joke,&quot; he said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The next move is for the representatives of the member states to consult their governments and come back to Egypt with a date for the next formal meeting, Bayyoumi said.</p>
<p>&quot;They want to reach an agreement or at least an agreement in principle by Malta in April,&quot; he added. Mediterranean states will meet in Malta for a round of talks on cooperation between the countries on the northern and southern shores of the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;So now there is time pressure on the European side. Malta is a sort of pressure,&quot; Bayyoumi said.</p>
<p>Egypt argues that the EU must be more flexible on its agricultural imports if it wants its southern neighbours to take talk of cooperation seriously.</p>
