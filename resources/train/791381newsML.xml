<p>Thousands of Palestinian protesters marched down Gaza's main street on Monday demanding Israel free their imprisoned sons and end a closure it imposed after a suicide attack last month in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as my son is in prison, I don't feel any peace,&quot; said a woman, whose 24-year-old son Ahmad is serving a life term in an Israeli jail.</p>
<p>The protesters -- including the wife of imprisoned Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin -- cradled framed, blown-up photos of their husbands and sons and waved Palestinian flags.</p>
<p>&quot;Yasser -- the leader and the president -- we are with you,&quot; one sign read, referring to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. &quot;There's no peace keeping prisoners as hostage,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials say 3,500 political prisoners remain in Israeli jails.</p>
<p>&quot;The leadership of the revolution made a peace deal with the Israeli government, so it's meaningless to keep the executors of the revolution in prison,&quot; Palestinian intelligence officer Ziad al-Mashrawi told the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;No agreement should be reached in the future without the prisoners included,&quot; he said at the protest, which began in front of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other protesters condemned the PLO's Oslo peace agreements with Israel.</p>
<p>A truck laden with homegrown Gaza produce was also brought in to protest at the closure, and fishermen towed in one of their boats, holding up empty nets.</p>
<p>Israel closed its borders to thousands of Palestinian labourers after the July 30 bombing killed 15 people including the two suicide bombers. It also restricted travel between West Bank cities, villages and towns.</p>
<p>Unemployment in Arab areas has since jumped to 70 percent, with workers barred from reaching jobs in Israel and local industries firing employees for lack of supplies, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Labour.</p>
<p>At least one person -- a 95-year-old Gazan woman -- died after being denied permission to cross into Israel for medical care, the Palestinian health minister said.</p>
<p>Israel says its measures are necessary to prevent further suicide bombings.</p>
<p>But Palestinians condemned the closure as collective punishment, and protesters sounded a warning of an &quot;explosion&quot; if it continued.</p>
<p>&quot;If the siege continues, and if Israel keeps the situation the way it is now, the explosion is coming, and nobody will be able to control it,&quot; said Telecommunications Minister Imad Falouji.</p>
<p>&quot;If the explosion comes it will exceed Gaza, the West Bank and Israel. It will paralyse the whole region and stability will collapse,&quot; he said.</p>
