<p>Bullish momentum could carry U.S. Treasuries marginally higher in the week ahead, but an unusually sparse economic calendar promises little in the way of decisive price action, economists said.</p>
<p>Treasuries are likely to encounter firm resistance as they approach the higher end of their recent six-month price range, they said, suggesting the market may have to wait until the following week's key data before a further rise.  </p>
<p>&quot;Things look a little bit better in terms of medium-term momentum but I think it's going to take some kind of event to sustain it,&quot; said Michael Krauss, managing director and chief technical strategist at Chase Securities Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;To break out you're going to need a high volume move ... and I don't think we're going to get it next week,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department's sales of $18.25 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday are likely to be the key focus early in the week.  </p>
<p>Later, Treasuries will turn their attention to weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday and durable goods and existing home sales numbers on Friday.</p>
<p>Economists expect claims for the week ended October 19 to drop off slightly to 336,000 versus 340,000 in the prior week. September durable goods are seen rising 2.0 percent after a sharp 3.2 percent fall in the prior month, while September existing home sales are expected to register 4.11 million annualized units against 4.13 million units in August.  </p>
<p>&quot;The economic calendar is certainly very light,&quot; said Russell Sheldon, senior economist at Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank. &quot;The durable goods number will be heavily influenced by a probable upswing in the aircraft component but other than that (the data) looks pretty soft.&quot;</p>
<p>Market analysts said the market is already looking past the upcoming week's data to key reports due the following week. The third quarter employment cost index and GDP report as well as the October payrolls and national purchasing managers releases are all due the week after next.  </p>
<p>Expectations for these data should influence the market's reception of new supply in the early half of the week, analysts suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid that it's the data I'm looking ahead to past next week that's going to be governing attitudes,&quot; said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. Inc.</p>
<p>The benchmark 6.75 percent 30-year bond was up 5/32 at 99-16/32 to yield 6.79 percent in late Friday trade. The federal funds rate is expected to open between 5-1/4 and 5-5/16 percent on Monday. -- 212 859-1673</p>
