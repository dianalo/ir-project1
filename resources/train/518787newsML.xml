<headline>China okays Taiwan firms for historic sailings.</headline>

<p>Mainland China on Thursday gave six Taiwan shipping firms approval to sail direct Taiwan-China routes for the first time in 48 years, reciprocating for similar permits issued by Taipei to five mainland carriers.</p>
<p>Executives said sailings could begin in the next few days, easing a ban enforced by Taipei since their 1949 civil war turned the narrow Taiwan strait into an ideological flash-point dividing China's communists and nationalists.</p>
<p>The private Taiwan Strait Shipping Association said it had received notice from its quasi-official mainland counterpart on Thursday that six Taiwan shipping firms had been approved.</p>
<p>Taiwan giants Uniglory Marine Corp and Yangming Marine Transport Corp confirmed by telephone that they both had a green light from Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;They notified us today that we should pick up the licence,&quot; Uniglory vice president Wang Rong-hsiung told Reuters.</p>
<p>Eager to be first, Yangming said it could begin immediately with the auspiciously renamed container ship Jin Quan -- Golden Champion -- standing by at the southern port of Kaohsiung.</p>
<p>Local media have said China's Sheng Da planned to sail from the mainland port of Xiamen for arrival in Kaohsiung on Friday, but Kaohsiung officials called this unlikely as they had not received the mandatory 24-hour advance notice late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Sheng Da or another mainland ship could enter Kaohsiung on Saturday if notice were filed on Friday, they added.</p>
<p>Officials in Beijing and Xiamen declined to give details.</p>
<p>The rivals' reciprocal approvals eliminated the final hurdle to direct sailings, though Taipei -- wary of Beijing's political intentions -- has enacted restrictions forbidding direct cargo exchanges so as to uphold its ban on direct mainland links.</p>
<p>Mainland cargoes will not be allowed to enter Taiwan customs but can be processed at Kaohsiung's new &quot;offshore transshipment centre&quot; for onward passage to third countries.</p>
<p>Likewise, Taiwan cargoes at Kaohsiung cannot be put aboard ships planning to cross directly to the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Taipei has banned direct links since the Republic of China, defeated by the communists in a civil war in 1949, fled into exile on Taiwan. Beijing sees Taiwan as rebel-held province that eventually must be brought under its sovereignty.</p>
<p>A political thaw begun in the late 1980s has unleashed an explosion of &quot;indirect&quot; links, including a total of about US$30 billion in mainland investments by some 30,000 Taiwan firms.</p>
<p>Those investors have pressed Taipei to ease its ban, saying direct sea, air and other links would pare away what they see as needless extra costs of routing business through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Consummation of direct shipping would fuel hopes for direct flights and other breakthoughs just when Taipei -- loath to become dangerously overdependent on its rival's economy -- has been trying to cool local firms' ardour for China investments.</p>
<p>Aside from Uniglory and Yangming, Beijing issued approvals to Taiwan's Wan Hai Lines, Nantai Line, Chinese Maritime Transport Ltd and Kien Hung Shipping.</p>
<p>The approvals came on what Taiwan experts said was the final possible day under a mainland law mandating that Beijing act on such applications within 45 days of receiving them.</p>
