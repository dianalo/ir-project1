<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises on Wednesday said that third-quarter 1996 cash operating profit advanced to $325 million, 19 percent above reported third-quarter 1995 results.</p>
<p>The comparable cash operating profit growth rate was 9 percent for the third quarter of 1996, building on a 10 percent comparable growth rate in the third quarter of 1995. Third-quarter 1996 cash operating profit results reflect solid domestic volume performance, higher net revenues per case, and a decrease in domestic cost of sales per case.  </p>
<p>&quot;With our strong nine-month 1996 performance as a base, we are confident that we can achieve at least 9 percent comparable cash operating profit growth and at least 25 percent earnings per share growth for full-year 1996,&quot; said Summerfield Johnston, vice chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola Enterprises.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997 and beyond, we continue to see strong momentum in our domestic business and expect to capitalize on the significant opportunities for profitable growth that are available in our European operations,&quot; Johnston said.  </p>
<p>The results of the French and Belgian acquisition did not materially affect third-quarter 1996 earnings per share, the company said, reflecting the unfavorable European summer weather conditions experienced in 1996 compared to 1995 which caused a 6 1/2 percent decrease in constant territory international volume.</p>
<p>The company said it expects the results of the French and Belgian operations to be dilutive to fourth-quarter 1996 results by about $0.05 per share reflecting the relationship between seasonally low fourth-quarter European carbonated beverage consumption and fixed costs such as depreciation, amortization, and interest expense.</p>
<p>As a result of the delay in closing the acquisition of the bottling operations in Great Britain, the company does not expect that this transaction will have any material effect on 1996 results.</p>
<p>For 1997, the company continues to expect earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.05 from the combined effect of the French, Belgian, and British acquisitions, which represent significant long-term opportunities for profitable volume growth.</p>
