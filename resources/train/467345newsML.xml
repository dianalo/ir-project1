<p>German conservatives called on Tuesday for a limit on Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union, prompting a World War Two comparison from the Jewish community and sharp criticism from opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Zeitlmann, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition, said increasing unemployment in Germany and rising abuse of the immigration procedure meant it was time for a rethink.</p>
<p>The proposal is also contained in a paper being drawn up by a working group of parliamentarians from the CSU and Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), according to media reports.</p>
<p>Zeitlmann, the CSU's domestic policy spokesman in parliament, said the government should sit down with Jewish community leaders and agree a limit on the immigrants.</p>
<p>The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, swiftly declared he would never participate in such talks. He said he would feel like a Jewish leader in wartime Poland negotiating with the Nazis about how Jews should be treated.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly won't hold any talks like those,&quot; Bubis told Southwest German Radio. &quot;I won't speak to any government about how many Jews I think should live in Germany.&quot;</p>
<p>The controversial proposal first surfaced in news magazines earlier this week, who said they came from the working group on employment and welfare. The head of the group declined to comment on any details, stressing the paper was only a draft.</p>
<p>But Zeitlmann dared to poke his head above the parapet with controversial comments in Tuesday's Express newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;The humanitarian intake for Jews can't go on for ever. It will have to be brought to an end again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kohl agreed in 1990 with the Central Council of Jews in Germany to take in an unlimited number of Jews from the Soviet Union. Germany's Jews hoped the move would breathe new life into a community practically wiped out by the Nazi Holocaust.</p>
<p>&quot;The chancellor and the premiers of our regional states granted the request from the Central Council of Jews to revive the Jewish communities,&quot; Zeitlmann said. &quot;Now an upper limit must be agreed with Herr Bubis.&quot;</p>
<p>Opposition politicians sensed a populist attempt to find scapegoats for massive German unemployment, which has reached a postwar record of 4.7 million under Kohl's government.</p>
<p>&quot;The Christian Democrats want to distract from their failings in social and economic policy,&quot; said Volker Beck, the legal policy spokesman for the Greens party.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners and refugees have to pay for it. The strategy isn't new. But what is new is that the Christian Democrats are now also targeting Jews,&quot; Beck said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is encouraging right-wing extremists to spread antisemitic slander,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Bubis said the conservatives' arguments were &quot;good material for bar-room tub-thumping&quot; and demonstrated a complete lack of knowledge of how Jews immigrate from the former Soviet Union. Talk of unhindered access to Germany was nonsense, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds good because only a few people know that it's all rubbish,&quot; he told the Tageszeitung newspaper.</p>
<p>Bubis pointed out that the immigration process was complicated, sometimes lasting more two years, and applicants were referred to one of Germany's regional states, which already have quotas for how many immigrants they will accept.</p>
<p>Bubis said around 60,000 Jews had come to Germany from the former Soviet Union since the agreement was struck.</p>
<p>The Jewish community was also angered last year by reports that a foreign ministry memorandum questioned whether the arrangement should continue. The government then declared it had no intention of restricting the Jews' immigration rights.</p>
