<p>Ukraine and Uzbekistan have failed to reach an agreement on the return of Crimean Tatars deported to Central Asia by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin during World War Two, a Tatar official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Refat Chubarov, leader of the 250,000-strong Crimean Tatar community, told Reuters after meetings between the Ukrainian and Uzbek prime ministers in Kiev that some &quot;difficulties&quot; remained on how to finance the return.</p>
<p>&quot;The draft of an agreement is almost ready but there are some differences between the two sides. We hope it will be signed at the next Ukrainian-Uzbek governmental meeting,&quot; he said, declining to give dates.</p>
<p>Chubarov said Uzbekistan wanted only those who were actually deported to be granted deportee status, but Crimean Tatars and Ukraine insisted that all their relatives and descendants should be included.</p>
<p>&quot;Uzbekistan must take part and sponsor the return of Crimean Tatars and the construction of housing for them, but the very financing depends on the number of people that would be given that status,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Soviet secret police NKVD deported 190,000 Crimean Tatars, accused by Stalin of collaborating with the Nazis, during a two-day period in 1944 to Central Asia in cattle trucks.</p>
<p>About 250,000 Crimean Tatars have returned to Ukraine's Crimean peninsula after receiving grudging permission from then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988, but have had great difficulties in building homes and getting land.</p>
<p>Chubarov said Crimean Tatars should be able to drop Uzbek nationality and obtain Ukrainian citizenship more easily.</p>
