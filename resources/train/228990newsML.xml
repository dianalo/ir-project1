<p>European Union ministers have blown out of proportion a dispute over one small part of a budget stability pact meant to ensure members of European monetary union stick to fiscal discipline after its launch, Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are blowing the problem out of proportion,&quot; he told reporters after EU finance ministers failed to agree how to define exceptional and temporary circumstances which would exempt member states from paying fines if they run up excessively big budget deficits after the launch of the euro.</p>
<p>&quot;We have gone into a tiny issue,&quot; Maystadt, a staunch advocate of the need for a stability pact, said.</p>
<p>&quot;We reached a agreement on all pending issues except one,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television. &quot;Some countries, especially Germany, would like to have a very precise definition of these exceptional circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a willingness to compromise on most issues, On this issue we did not reach a consensus,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers agreed to reconvene on December 12 on the eve of a summit of EU heads of state in Dublin to try to iron out a dispute which has pitted Germany against most of its EU partners.</p>
<p>Germany has insisted on a numerical definition of the exceptional circumstances -- such as a severe recession -- which could be used to justify member states running up budget deficits above three percent of gross domestic product after the launch of the single currency.</p>
<p>Maystadt said he hoped finance ministers would be able to resolve the dispute, but appeared to suggest that the heads of government might be needed to provide the political impetus to get the deal agreed.</p>
<p>He said he hoped &quot;the heads of state will put this issue into its true perspective and reduce it to its true dimension,&quot; he said.</p>
