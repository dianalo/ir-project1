<headline>SHARES GAIN, MORE SLIGHT INCREASES SEEN.</headline>
<dateline>VILNIUS 1997-06-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>* Official index edges up 1.39 points to 880.47 points.</p>
<p>* Group A shares advance 24.33 points to 1879.92 points.</p>
<p>* Central market turnover falls to 390,000 litas from 541,000 litas.</p>
<p>* Block trades turnover falls to 285,000 litas from about one million litas.</p>
<p>* Analysts see limited optimism and expect slight increases in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Shares advanced on Friday on Lithuania's stock exchange as brokers said they saw signs of limited increases in share prices in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the indices were a little up and we feel some demand so maybe the market could move up a little,&quot; said Robertas Berzhinskas, a broker with Vilniaus Bank.</p>
<p>The official index edged up 1.39 points to 880.47 points and group A shares advanced 24.33 points to 1879.92 points.</p>
<p>Central market turnover fell to 390,000 litas from 541,000 litas, while block trades turnover slid to 285,000 litas from about one million litas.</p>
<p>&quot;I think most likely there will be a small increase in the indices in the next couple of weeks, but I don't expect any big developments,&quot; said Aurimas Rishka, a market analyst with the Litimpeks brokerage</p>
<p>Brokers say that although the market feels undervalued it still lacks liquidity and that they do not expect this to change during the summer.</p>
<p>Brokers have hopes that, despite the market doldrums, stocks like Lithuanian Sea Shipping Company (LISCO) will continue to see healthy demand and maybe carry the market.</p>
<p>LISCO rose to 6.42 litas from 6.35 litas amid central market turnover of 91,000 litas and turned over 64,000 litas in block trades at 6.42 litas.</p>
<p>Brokers say summer has also brought increased interest in brewer Kalnapilis, which saw no activity on the central market but turned over 71,000 litas in block trades at 6.16 litas.</p>
<p>Kalnapilis was quoted at 6.01 litas on the central market, unchanged from 6.01 litas yesterday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Kalnapilis could go up to 6.50 litas in the next two or three weeks because there is some demand for it and it's one of the best companies listed on the exchange,&quot; said Rishka.</p>
<p>Brokers say Hermis Bank has also seen high demand recently.</p>
<p>Hermis inched up to 182.00 litas from 181.00 litas amid central market turnover of 34,000 litas and turned over 113,000 litas at 182.00 litas in block trades.</p>
<p>&quot;Hermis Bank is undervalued compared to Vilniaus Bank and I think we can expect the price of Hermis to reach 200.00 litas in the next few weeks because the demand is growing,&quot; Rishka said.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank was steady at 225.00 litas on the central market amid low turnover of 9,000.00 litas.</p>
