<p>Gianni Versace's friends and business rivals in the fashion world poured out their shock and grief over the Italian designer's murder in Miami on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In statements from their offices on New York's Seventh Avenue -- also known as Fashion Avenue -- leading designers such as Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Giorgio Armani hailed Versace for his life's work.</p>
<p>&quot;The news of Gianni Versace's death has left me in a state of shock,&quot; Giorgio Armani said. &quot;Gianni Versace, together with a handful of names, symbolises the success of Italian fashion all over the world. My reaction is one of revolt against such an unnatural and violent death, and one of profound grief.&quot;</p>
<p>Employees at his Manhattan boutiques were stunned by the news that 50-year-old Versace had been gunned down outside his Miami Beach home. One said she would miss his gentleness.</p>
<p>&quot;He would shake the hand of all the employees to say hi,&quot; said 31-year-old Paola Sermidi from Milan, who has worked in the Fifth Avenue store for two years.</p>
<p>&quot;He was very laid back...he was a really nice person, very down to earth,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>New York designer Donna Karan said Versace &quot;combined the spirit of America with the sophistication of Europe&quot; and was prepared to take risks. He was the first designer to mix the worlds of rock 'n' roll and Hollywood with fashion.</p>
<p>&quot;The loss of Gianni Versace is deeply felt by all,&quot; Karan said. I am personally devastated by his death.&quot;</p>
<p>Versace's fellow designers sent condolences to his family, including sister Donatella and brother Santo, who were both involved in the Versace business.</p>
<p>Calvin Klein said the fashion world &quot;has lost one of the great designers of our time.&quot;</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, musician and Oscar-awards show producer Quincy Jones said he was shocked at Versace's death.</p>
<p>&quot;Music and fashion are the two art forms which more than any other, dictate and reflect what is happening in the world culturally. As a designer, Gianni was completely aware of that correlation.</p>
<p>&quot;Again we wake to find that we have had a great artist and friend tragically taken away from us. When will it end?&quot;</p>
