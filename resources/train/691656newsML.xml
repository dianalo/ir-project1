<p>The Milwaukee Brewers made sure they would keep another of their young players in the fold Friday, signing third baseman Jeff Cirillo to a four-year contract at undisclosed terms.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Cirillo is batting .301 with six homers and 50 runs batted in in 71 games this season. He set the club record for RBI by a third baseman last year with 83 and is a lifetime .299 hitter.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to have Jeff under wraps into the next millenium,&quot; said Brewers vice president of operations Sal Bando. &quot;He has all the makings of becoming a perennial All-Star and he fits the personality of Milwaukee and the Brewers perfectly.&quot;</p>
<p>Cirillo is the fourth player who is under contract for the opening of Miller Park, which is slated to become the Brewers' new stadium in 2000. Pitcher Cal Eldred, first baseman Dave Nilsson and shortstop Jose Valentin are the other three.</p>
