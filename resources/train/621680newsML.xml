<p>Belgian linear bond (OLO) futures are expected to continue to recover on Wednesday from an eight-day, 200-bp selloff which started at 122.03 on May 15.</p>
<p>One chartist said the future, 20 basis points higher at 120.64 by 0825 GMT, could easily rally to 121 and then to 121.25 where it would meet the support line (now a resistance line) of the April 4-May 14 rally. He did not expect the market to run much further.</p>
<p>Many dealers said the undertone was one of caution, with some top players -- notably Kredietbank  KRBI -- recommending a sell-on-dips strategy for the long run.  </p>
<p>Volume was small ahead of Thursday's holiday closure of the German market and with no major U.S. or Geman indicators due in the coming days. Dealers said that the lack of volume could exacerbate price moves.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the French franc and the OAT/Bund spread did not reflect much concern about the result of Sunday's second round of parliamentary elections, but there was still potential for an upset if president Jacques Chirac chose a new, anti-EMU prime minister  M-G-FR.</p>
<p>Money market yields remained high as the franc lingered above its ERM central rate.</p>
<p>The franc was nearly unchanged at 20.6420/35 to the mark, one-week repos stood at 3.30/34 percent, well above the 3.00 percent official central rate.</p>
