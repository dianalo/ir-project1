<p>Turkey on Monday defended its efforts to halt drug smuggling, saying it had seized 40 percent of all heroin intercepted worldwide in 1996, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>Tuncay Yilmaz, chief of Turkey's organised crime squad, said police seized 4.422 tonnes of heroin last year, out of global seizures of 11 tonnes. In 1995, heroin seizures in Turkey totalled 3.456 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;The struggle carried out by Turkey in this area is ignored,&quot; Yilmaz was quoted as telling a news conference by Anatolian.</p>
<p>The report followed the release by the Foreign Ministry of a statement defending Turkey against foreign criticism reported in the domestic media.</p>
<p>&quot;In recent days an increase has been seen in allegations directed at Turkey in connection with drug smuggling,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever the aim of these allegations, Turkey is determined to continue international cooperation and a decisive campaign against drug smuggling,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Turkey is on the &quot;Balkan route&quot;, used to transport narcotics from Afghanistan and Pakistan across Iran and northern Iraq to Europe either by land through Istanbul and Thrace or by sea from the western Turkish port of Izmir.</p>
<p>Turkish authorities accuse Kurdish guerrillas seeking self-rule in the southeast of the country of being heavily involved in the drugs trade.</p>
<p>At Monday's news conference, Yilmaz said more than 6,000 people were detained in 1996 in connection with drug-related crimes.</p>
<p>Hashish seizures in 1996 amounted to 12.294 tonnes, compared with 17.360 tonnes a year earlier, he said.</p>
