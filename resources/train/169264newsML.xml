<p>President Boris Yeltsin is recovering well from his heart operation and the next bulletin about his health will be released on Thursday, the Kremlin press office said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;At 1600 (1300 GMT) on November 6, the post-operative recovery process of the president of the Russian Federation is proceeding normally, in line with the doctors' expectations and without complications,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The next bulletin about the president's state of health will be on November 7,&quot; the statement added. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The Kremlin has provided regular statements about Yeltsin's health since doctors began their seven-hour multiple bypass operation at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The president handed power over to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin for the duration of the surgery, but he regained control of Russia early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Top U.S. surgeon Michael DeBakey, who advised the Russian doctors on the operation, said that he was delighted by the president's condition after the operation, but he advised the Russian leader to take things easy.</p>
<p>Aides said Yeltsin, 65, was anxious to leave the Cardiology Research Centre, where the operation took place, for the Central Clinical Hospital where he has already been treated several times for heart problems.</p>
