<title>USA: Merck's Cozaar could cut heart failure death rate.</title>

<p>The anti-hypertensive drug losartan, which is made by Merck and Co Inc under the brand name Cozaar, could significantly reduce the mortality rate in those with heart failure, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>Researchers found that treatment with losartan resulted in a 46-percent decrease in sudden-death risk, as compared to standard therapy with the ACE inhibitor captopril, or Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's Capoten, among elderly heart-failure patients.  </p>
<p>Results appeared in medical journal The Lancet and would be presented March 18 at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting in Anaheim, Calif.</p>
<p>The trial was funded by Merck and led by a cardiologist at the University of Michigan Medical Center.</p>
<p>The finding was a surprise, researchers said, since the purpose of the study had primarily been to assess the risk of kidney complications in those who took losartan.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is an unexpected but potentially important finding that will require further investigation in more patients over more time,&quot; Bertram Pitt, professor and associate chairman of the University of Michigan Department of Internal Medicine.</p>
<p>Losartan was also significantly better tolerated than captopril, resulting in a lower incidence of dry cough, it said. Both losartan and captopril posed about the same risk of kidney problems, the company said.  </p>
<p>The so-called ELITE trial involved more than 700 patients aged 65 and over, most of whom were white males. Participants were treated in 125 centers in 24 countries throughout the United States, Europe and South America.</p>
<p>The 48-week study respresented the first long-term comparison of ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the production of the hormone angiotensin, with angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, like losartan.  </p>
<p>Antagonists like losartan blocked the effects of angiotensin II at the receptor level rather than inhibit its production, researchers said.</p>
<p>A larger international multicenter trial involving more than 2,000 patients was underway to compare the two drug-treatment strategies in patients with heart failure, the researchers said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the larger study confirms that the A-II receptor antagonist losartan decreases mortality in comparison with the ACE inhibitor captopril, it will have major implications for future basic and clinical research as well as for the treatment of those with heart failure,&quot; Pitt said.</p>
