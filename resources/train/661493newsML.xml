<p>A young regional leader from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) said on Friday the Bonn coalition must take a more flexible approach to covering budget shortfalls if it wants to survive.</p>
<p>Peter Mueller, CDU leader in the state of Saar, told German Radio the coalition was gradually making progress on its budgetary problems after partners struck an agreement late on Thursday to fill new holes that had emerged in the 1998 and 1999 budgets.</p>
<p>But he blamed Bonn's budgetary impasse on coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP), Germany's self-styled party of tax-cutters, and Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who insists on a strict interpretation of financial criteria for countries wanting to join the planned European single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We must get away from the position of the FDP and the Finance Ministry. We need a solid budget plan and it is unrealistic to rule out raising taxes and increasing public debt to achieve this,&quot; Mueller said.</p>
<p>Mueller said valued added tax (VAT) could be raised to help plug gaping budget holes and argued it was too early for the coalition to go ahead with legislation next year to lower the solidarity tax surcharge levied to rebuild east Germany.</p>
<p>He said Waigel should drop his strict interpretation of the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU) requiring members target a maximum budget deficit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't matter whether the deficit is 3.0, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4 percent of GDP,&quot; Mueller said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not realistic to expect Germany to achieve this target with 300,000 more unemployed this year than forecast, costing us an extra nine billion marks ($5.2 billion) annually,&quot; he said, adding that the Finance Ministry's forecasts on this year's economic performance had been &quot;overly optimistic&quot;.</p>
<p>CDU and FDP leaders agreed on an amended programme of tax reforms to help to negate new budget holes for 1998 and 1999 after a series of recent crisis meetings.</p>
<p>The tax reform is a mix of eliminating tax write-offs and lowering tax rates. It aims to lower tax levels for companies and individuals while making it more difficult to avoid taxes.</p>
<p>The reforms were originally intended to reduce the overall tax burden by 30 billion marks in 1999, but it was not clear if the amended plan would hit that target or whether the opposition Social Democrats will support the plan.</p>
<p>The SPD, though a minority in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, could block such legislation in the Bundesrat upper house where they have a majority of seats.</p>
