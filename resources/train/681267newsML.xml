<headline>German court jails doctor for AIDS death.</headline>
<dateline>GOETTINGEN, Germany 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>A German court on Monday jailed a doctor for the death of a woman who received a blood transfusion he had failed to screen for the HIV virus.</p>
<p>The court in the central town of Goettingen said Guenter Eckert had not screened thousands of blood samples over several years in the 1980s but it could only be proved in one case that a victim died of AIDS as a result of an infected transfusion.</p>
<p>The court sentenced Eckert to six and a half years in prison, finding him guilty of causing bodily harm which resulted in death. He was also convicted of lying under oath.</p>
<p>The scandal provoked panic in Germany when it was uncovered in 1993. Thousands of Germans rushed to take blood tests fearing they may have been infected.</p>
<p>Presiding judge Reiner Finke said Eckert, 57, had accepted the possibility of infection through the transfusions but had not deliberately set out to kill or act negligently. He also took into account the doctor's regret at his actions.</p>
<p>Eckert worked in a private laboratory testing blood samples for a company called Haemoplas, which supplied blood samples and products to hospitals all over the country.</p>
<p>Samples from a drug addict carrying the HIV virus were among those not screened by the lab.</p>
<p>This led to at least 13 patients being infected. All but one has since died but the court ruled that AIDS could only be proved as the cause of death in the case of a Munich nurse.</p>
<p>The doctor's conviction marked another step in prosecutors' battle to bring to book negligent Germans involved in the blood products business.</p>
<p>A court in Koblenz convicted three executives and a lab assistant from another blood products company in 1995 for distributing shoddily tested blood products, causing the death of at least two people.</p>
<p>The executives admitted during their 16-month trial that they had at various times combined blood samples from up to three donors before testing them for HIV or hepatitis.</p>
