<p>Swedish bond yields ended marginally lower on Wednesday, pushed off morning and midday lows by weaker international markets following a stronger than expected U.S. March trade deficit.</p>
<p>The U.S. March trade deficit shrunk to $8.51 billion while analysts had expected $10.3 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S., Germany and Italy have performed poorly,&quot; a trader said. &quot;There has been a downward correction in Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>The fact that the spread between Swedish and German long yields has narrowed sharply recently also called for a correction, he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a very nervous market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yields opened lower after a Tuesday five-party agreement to strengthen the Riksbank's position that some dealers saw paving the way for a link to Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU). But when foreign markets softened Swedish yields came off earlier lows.</p>
<p>Six-month T-bill rates fell one basis point to 4.19 percent and the ten-year bond yield slid one basis point to 6.94 percent. The crown firmed to 4.4550 against the mark from 4.4740 late on Tuesday.</p>
