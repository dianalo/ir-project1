<p>Unocal Corp. officials Monday defended the oil company's controversial investments in Burma, telling shareholders it had no plans to walk away from a planned $1.2 billion pipeline project.</p>
<p>During the annual meeting, Chief Executive Officer Roger Beach pledged to maintain the company's partial stake in the project despite criticism that the company uses slave labor, causing the death and torture of Burmese workers.</p>
<p>The pipeline, due for completion next year, is to carry natural gas from offshore Burma to Thailand.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain fully committed to all projects in (Burma) that we're participating in,&quot; Beach told about 500 stockholders at the meeting.</p>
<p>Mounting international criticism, including sanctions against new U.S. investment, has focused attention on Unocal's growing overseas investments, which will account for two-thirds of its $1.34 billion capital spending in 1997.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Beach stressed Unocal has improved the lives of Burmese through schools, jobs, and health centers.</p>
<p>&quot;Every Unocal stockholder should be proud of our investment in (Burma),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>About 95 percent of Unocal shareholders rejected two proposals to investigate how much the Burmese investments would damage the company's public image and to look into allegations of illegal drug laundering by one of its Burmese partners. However, the proposals did receive enough support to be considered at next year's meeting.</p>
<p>During the two-hour meeting, which was puntuated by several outbursts from critics of the company's policies, a dozen shareholders condemned Unocal's policies and called for further investigations.</p>
<p>Outside, about two dozen protesters waved placards or offered passing motorists samples of fake heroin.</p>
<p>Critics say one of Unocal's pipeline partners, Myanmar Oil and Gas Interprise (MOGE), is a conduit for illegal drug laundering and that half the heroin coming to the United States goes through Burma, also known as Myanmar.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not condemning progress or development...but there is everything wrong with doing this at the price of human dignity,&quot; said Father Joe La Mar, a shareholder.</p>
<p>Beach said Unocal was moving forward with its pipeline project, but if forced out would still make money.</p>
<p>&quot;We're confident we can sell our interest at a premium,&quot; Beach said.</p>
