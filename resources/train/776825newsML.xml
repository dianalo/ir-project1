<headline>Dollar pauses for breath with eyes on German data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>The dollar steadied, with traders expecting it to set new seven-and-a-half-year peaks against the mark if reports this week show the German economy is too weak to withstand higher interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some background concern about German interest rates but German data should show that it will be difficult for the Bundesbank to raise rates,&quot; said Rob Hayward, economic adviser at Bank of America in London. &quot;This will help the dollar rise above 1.87 with the obvious target at 1.90.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. currency is also expected to top the four-year highs it climbed to against the Swiss franc overnight.  </p>
<p>Broad-based yen gains and speculation that Japan will protest against dollar gains above 120 yen prevented the dollar making much headway against the yen, analysts said.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.8625/35 marks at 0745 GMT from 1.8631/36 late Friday in Europe. It was 118.35/45 yen from 118.37/47 on Friday. The U.S currency rose as high as 1.5326 Swiss francs overnight, the strongest it has been since August 1993. It was last at 1.5274/84 from 1.5285/95 late Friday in Europe.</p>
<p>In recent weeks traders have focused on the possibility that the Bundesbank will nudge its key money-market rate up from record lows if mark weakness persists.  </p>
<p>The German central bank has encouraged such talk by fixing the securities repurchase rate at 3.0 percent for two weeks rather than the full four-week duration of its summer recess.</p>
<p>Traders, however, have bet that German economic recovery is too fragile to allow the Bundesbank to raise rates and have continued to drive the mark lower. The German currency is now trading near five-year lows on a trade-weighted basis, according to economists at ABN Amro.</p>
<p>German June industrial production, June manufacturing orders numbers and July jobless statistics, out this week, need to confirm this view if the mark is to fall further, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;German figures have room to disappoint and this will give the dollar a lift against the mark,&quot; said Steve Barrow, analyst at Banque National de Paris in London. He is targeting a move up to 1.90 marks in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>By contrast, U.S. economic reports on Friday showed growth was stronger than many traders were expecting and revived speculation of higher U.S. interest rates in the coming months.</p>
<p>Speculation that the premium U.S. rates offer over their Japanese and German counterparts is set to widen will support the dollar, analysts said. Still, they expect the U.S. currency to falter if U.S. stocks and bonds extend Friday's losses.  </p>
<p>&quot;U.S. data painted a very positive picture of the U.S. economy,&quot; said Hayward at bank of America. &quot;While there is some caution about the U.S. asset markets dollar/mark will probably resume its uptrend.&quot;</p>
<p>While the dollar has also gained against the yen in the past week, setting a two-month high of 119.17 on Friday, it is struggling to break above 120 yen.</p>
<p>The yen was bolstered overnight after Japan's Economic Planning Agency minister Taro Aso said in an interview with Dow Jones on Sunday that a rise in Japan's official discount rate is &quot;very possible&quot; by the end of 1997.  </p>
<p>These comments pushed the yield on the 10-year benchmark Japanese government bond back up from a record low of 2.070 percent.</p>
<p>Meantime, the dollar was also capped against the yen amid expectations that Japan does not want to risk triggering trade tensions with the U.S. by allowing the yen to weaken much further.</p>
