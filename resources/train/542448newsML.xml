<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices were mixed Monday in lackluster activity, with grades in New York steady to slightly lower, while some demand into Florida helped firm fuel at the U.S. Gulf, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some utility demand into Florida which has helped the Gulf. The market may be due for a bounce,&quot; said one cash trader, adding stable crude and better cooling demand likely later in the month could underpin prices near-term. New York Harbor physical one percent eased slightly to $14.50-75 a barrel, with May paper quoted almost a quarter lower at $14.25-60, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour also lost ground, with fairly prompt barrels again offered 40 cents lower at about $15.50.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York were unchanged, with three percent still pegged at $14.00-25, traders said.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, prices firmed slightly, with one percent up 15 cents to $14.50, while three percent was a dime higher at $13.25.</p>
<p>No NYH or USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate gas for May delivery slipped a nickel to about the $2.40/mmBtu level, or $15.12 a barrel equivalent. May gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, also was quoted five cents lower at $2.10/mmBtu, or $13.23 a barrel.</p>
