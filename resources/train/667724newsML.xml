<p>The Sri Lankan government has granted approval to eight new private television networks and five new radio stations, Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera told parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Samaraweera said in reply to a question that the ruling People's Alliance government had received applications for 18 television networks and 14 radio stations since it came to power in late 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already issued licences for 13 stations, radio and television,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>None of the approved television and radio stations have started operations.</p>
<p>The tiny Indian Ocean island currently has eight television stations -- all but two of them owned by private investors -- and about a dozen radio stations, most of them privately owned.</p>
<p>In April, the government introduced in parliament a bill to set up a broadcasting authority with wide powers to monitor, regulate and grant operating licences to broadcasters.</p>
<p>But the bill was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court after media organisations challenged it in court.</p>
<p>Samaraweera, who replaced Dharmasiri Senanayke as media minister last week, also made changes in the government media by appointing new directors to the boards of the state-owned radio and television networks.</p>
<p>He has also brought in new people to run Associated Newspapers, which publishes the island's biggest-selling English-language newspaper, The Daily News, among other publications.</p>
