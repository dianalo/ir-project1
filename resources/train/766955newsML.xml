<p>India pledged on Wednesday to give high priority to building a controversial ballistic missile after announcing last year it was mothballing the project.</p>
<p>&quot;With three flight tests, the re-entry technology demonstration under project Agni has been successfully completed,&quot; Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav told parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been decided to accord high priority to the next phase of the Agni programme,&quot; Yadav said.</p>
<p>India said last December it had completed testing the intermediate-range Agni but did not plan to build the missile, apparently under pressure from the United States and other countries opposed to India's missile programme.</p>
<p>A parliamentary panel in April urged the government to press ahead with the project, saying it was essential for India's national security.</p>
<p>The 2,500-km (1,500-mile) range Agni is believed capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and is regarded as a potential deterrent to nuclear-armed China, which shares a long Himalayan border with India.</p>
<p>China and India fought a brief war in 1962 and analysts say China's first nuclear test two years later prompted India's only nuclear test in 1974.</p>
<p>India last tested the 14-tonne, 19-metre (60-foot) Agni in 1994. Yadav was replying to an opposition lawmaker's question on whether the country had shelved the Agni missile project under international pressure.</p>
<p>The United States has urged New Delhi to halt missile testing permanently, fearing an arms race in South Asia.</p>
<p>Neighbours India and Pakistan, who have fought three wars since 1947, say they have not built nuclear weapons, but experts say both countries can swiftly assemble them.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is not reconsidering changes in its policy for development of nuclear technology for defence proposals,&quot; Yadav said in a written reply.</p>
<p>Junior Defence Minister N.V.N. Somu said the government had received a proposal for developing an integrated anti-missile defence system, but it was not in the interests of national security to give further details.</p>
