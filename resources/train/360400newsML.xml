<headline>Mexico seeks prices for U.S. wheat/soybeans - trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico may be considering the purchase of 40,000 to 70,000 tonnes of U.S. hard red winter wheat and 20,000 tonnes of U.S. no.2 soybeans Thursday night, several U.S. exporters and brokers said.</p>
<p>But they stressed that Mexico had no intentions of buying the wheat Thursday night and was just seeking prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a chance that a Mexican buying group is looking for 70,000 tonnes U.S. hard red winter wheat for February, March and April shipment,&quot; one U.S. exporter said.  </p>
<p>The exporter added he had not been able to pin it down as an actual tender. &quot;I am positive they (Mexico) have not bought,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One U.S. broker said he understood that Mexico was seeking around 57,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>Yet another broker said he was certain Mexico had no plans to purchase the wheat and have only asked for nominal offers.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been unclear. They have no intention of buying tonight (Thursday night), only to price the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted Mexico was seeking a combination of wheat and soybeans. &quot;I think it would be a total of 60,000 tonnes. So it would probably be 40,000 tonnes U.S. wheat and 20,000 tonnes U.S. no. 2 soybeans,&quot; he said.</p>
