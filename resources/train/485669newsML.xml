<p>The Bank of Israel is paying a heavy price in the foreign currency market in its battle to contain inflation, but the market is convinced the bank will not back down, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bank is soaking up dollars flooding into the economy as Israelis increasingly borrow overseas to take advantage of lower comparative interest rates.</p>
<p>The foreign loans are prompted by high domestic interest rates imposed by the central bank to fight inflation and offset excess government spending.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the central bank has been forced to intervene almost daily in the local forex market to offset massive demand for shekels. On Wednesday alone, dealers said, it bought more than $200 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Israel can continue, but it can't go on forever,&quot; said Ilan Raviv, manager of Israel Discount Bank's forex dealing. &quot;The amounts aren't sustainable from the shekel point of view. You can't keep printing money.&quot;</p>
<p>But, he and other dealers said, the market thinks the central bank will continue on its path for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't frighten people because the Bank of Israel governor says if he had to choose between (defending) the exchange rate and inflation, he'd choose (fighting) inflation,&quot; said Raviv.</p>
<p>The intervention is aimed at supporting the foreign currency basket rate, to which the shekel is officially linked. The rate trades in a band seven percent above or below its midpoint.</p>
<p>However since mid-January, the rate has been scraping along at the bottom of the band, forcing the central bank to intervene to prevent it from falling through the bottom.</p>
<p>The demand for shekels is due to a renewed surge of foreign currency borrowing by the Israeli business sector to take advantage of lower foreign interest rates, said Michal Rotlevy, a dealer United Mizrahi Bank. Israel's prime rate is currently 15.4 percent in nominal terms.</p>
<p>Borrowers are converting the foreign currency into shekels creating huge demand for the Israeli currency. The central bank soaks up the shekels through currency swaps and by luring deposits from the commercial banks with high interest rates.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, media reports said the pressure was due to a big foreign exchange loan Israel Corp took to finance its 667 million shekel purchase of an Israel Chemicals Ltd stake. &quot;We see a lot of big deals in the economy being financed by forex loans,&quot; said Raviv.</p>
<p>Rotlevy said the demand for foreign currency loans began at the end of last year, when the market concluded that the Treasury's 1997 budget cuts were insufficient to prompt the Bank of Israel to lower interest rates significantly.</p>
<p>She added that the recent acceleration of inflation has strengthened that view. &quot;Everyone is expecting high (consumer price index figures) so the Bank of Israel won't lower interest rates,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Borrowers reason that without a cut, the interest rate differential between Israel and abroad will remain wide and the prospects for a significant depreciation of the shekel will be slim.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel has not yet published figures on the extent of capital imports in the first quarter and it will not comment on the extent of its market intervention.</p>
<p>But foreign currency reserves, which central bank officials said is a rough indicator for both figures, have risen $3.8 billion this year to record $15.3 billion at the end of March.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Bank of Israel wants to resolve the problem without having to make concessions on interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Israel wants to move towards full currency liberalisation and stop all intervention,&quot; said Rotlevy.</p>
<p>Governor Jacob Frenkel reiterated his call for liberalisation earlier this week, but the Treasury is reportedly blocking any such move in hopes of jawboning the central bank into lowering interest rates.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the market is betting an an interim move to widen the currency band, which would alleviate the pressure to intervene, said Rotlevy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Israel may widen the currency band by seven, 10 or even 12 percent -- this is the market's reasonable expectation,&quot; she said.</p>
