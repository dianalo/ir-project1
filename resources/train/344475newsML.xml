<p>A senior Indian Finance Ministry official said on Thursday that measures which the government has announced over the past month constituted a &quot;package&quot; aimed at boosting economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a series of announcements over the past 30 days,&quot; said the official, who asked not to be named. &quot;That is what the package is.&quot;</p>
<p>The official's comments appeared to confirm that the government was not preparing a single, new package of economic measures to boost the capital markets before Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda leaves for Switzerland on Friday.</p>
<p>The government was preparing a list of measures which had already been unveiled as well as a statement outlining steps taken to boost the economy, the official said.</p>
<p>Stock markets have been jittery on speculation that Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda may announce a fresh batch of reforms before he leaves for the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday.</p>
<p>Blue chips suffered fresh losses on the Bombay stock exchange on Thursday. The benchmark index fell 15.92 points or 0.45 percent to 3,510.05.</p>
