<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices were mixed Friday in moderate, late trade, with more offers in the U.S. Gulf pressuring prices there, while New York grades were steady to slightly higher, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bunkers are weaker and there are a few more barrels showing up in the Gulf,&quot; said one cash trader, noting one very aggressive USG low sulphur seller.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent slipped at least a quarter to $15.75 a barrel though one seller was heard as low as $15 for barrels at the Mississippi River. USG three percent skidded 50 cents or more to the $13.50-75 area, traders said.  </p>
<p>Early USG three percent paper quotes were still in the $13.35-55 area, but some thought real values were closer to $13.25.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, some low sulphur utility interest helped boost physical one percent prices by 15 cents to about $16, while July paper firmed a similar amount to $15.75.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour again inched up slightly to $17.25 amid prospects for some cooling demand from the heat.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York notionally were unchanged.</p>
<p>No NYH or USG deals were confirmed.</p>
<p>New York city gate weekend gas prices firmed slightly to the $2.48/mmBtu area, or $15.62 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, also scored a modest gain to about $2.24/mmBtu, or $14.11 a barrel.</p>
