<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman has cancelled a planned visit to Switzerland, but not because of a Jewish dispute with the Swiss over the fate of bank accounts left ownerless by the Holocaust, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israel's embassy in Berne said Weizman had dropped plans to attend on August 31 the 100th anniversary of the first Zionist congress, which met in the Swiss city of Basle and launched a movement that led to the founding of Israel in 1948.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason is because of unforeseen problems that have arisen in his agenda,&quot; an embassy spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is absolutely no connection between the cancellation of the visit and the issue of Holocaust victims' money,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Switzerland is trying to soothe anger at world Jewish groups raised by official Swiss criticism of efforts to find bank accounts and assets left by Jews killed in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Weizman's decision also meant he would not meet Swiss government leaders in Berne as had been planned in connection with the Basle trip, the embassy spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bilateral talks in Berne have been rescheduled, not cancelled,&quot; he said, adding that no alternative date had been set yet.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Israel Knesset (parliament) speaker Dan Tichon would take part in the Basle cermonies commemorating the first congress of the Zionist movement for a Jewish state started by Theodor Herzl.</p>
<p>Berne and Swiss banks agreed last week to set up a Holocaust memorial fund. But ties with Jewish organisations were strained again this week by publication of a confidential report from Berne's ambassador in Washington that called for &quot;waging war&quot; against Jewish groups and other critics.</p>
<p>Ambassador Carlo Jagmetti resigned on Monday over the controversy..</p>
<p>Outgoing Swiss president Jean-Pascal Delamuraz was earlier this month forced to apologise for calling Jewish compensation demands &quot;blackmail&quot;.</p>
