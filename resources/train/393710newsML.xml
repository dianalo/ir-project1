<headline>Russia, NATO making progress on agreement - Albright.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-02-21</dateline>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Friday that the United States and Russia had made &quot;very important progress&quot; on an agreement between Moscow and the Western NATO alliance.</p>
<p>But she told a news conference after two days of talks with Russian officials that some very complex questions remained.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that we have made some very important progress on this,&quot; she said, asked about a document which would define a new relationship between NATO and Russia in the post Cold War world.</p>
<p>Albright said her discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had been &quot;serious and constructive&quot;. But she added: &quot;It is clear we have some complex questions to resolve.&quot;</p>
<p>Primakov told the news conference that the two sides had agreed that the document to be signed by Russia and NATO must have a &quot;mandatory or binding nature&quot;. But Albright did not address this point, and it was unclear if the U.S. had agreed to it.</p>
<p>Russia opposes NATO efforts to invite countries of central and eastern Europe to join NATO. Primakov said Russia was doing everything it could to &quot;minimise the negative consequences&quot; of NATO's expansion plans.</p>
