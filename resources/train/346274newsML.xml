<title>UK: Wet Brent trades wide apart, clockings weaken tone.</title>
<headline>Wet Brent trades wide apart, clockings weaken tone.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two wet Brent trades at sharply variant levels briefly puzzled the North Sea crude market on Friday afternoon, but when the dust settled the sentiment was slightly weaker, traders said.</p>
<p>A Feb 11-13 cargo which fetched Mar Brent +42 cents on Thursday was resold at Mar Brent +44 cents on Friday. But a Feb 14-16 loader later traded at Mar Brent +33 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't put the market over 40,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The 44 deal looks a bit contrived to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Some traders said the buyer of the higher priced Brent was sitting on a big Feb paper position.  </p>
<p>Compounding the slightly bearish sentiment among most in the market was the clocking of four of the five Brent dates turning wet on Friday.</p>
<p>One cargo loading Feb 17-19 was kept by U.S. trader JP Morgan which was heard back on offer at Mar Brent +40 cents late in the day.</p>
<p>JP Morgan was clocked with another cargo along with BP and Mobil. Morgan Stanley and BP were in dispute over the fifth.</p>
<p>Other North Sea crudes held firm, a Gullfaks A was traded at Dated Brent +30 cents, and a Troll was heard traded at Dated +53 cents.  </p>
<p>Brent paper supported the weaker end of Friday's physical trades. CFDs for next week were pegged at Mar Brent +32/36 late in the day, with the following week at Mar Brent +14/17.</p>
<p>Feb/Mar Brent was thinly talked but valued around +64, while Mar/Apr was talked at +49/53, having traded at +49 and +50 cts.</p>
<p>March Brent outright was trading 26 cents weaker on the IPE screen at $22.92 a barrel at 1836 GMT.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, Russian Urals held steady at around Dated Brent -65/70. Local refiners complained about poor margins, but traders said that scarce supplies were supporting levels. --Rosalind Russell, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5387</p>
