<headline>Russia and U.S. payroll data keep Bradys on edge.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-10</dateline>

<p>Russia was again almost the only paper to trade in the emerging debt market, which is holding back until U.S. payroll figures later in the day point to the next direction for U.S. interest rates and so Bradys.</p>
<p>Russian Vneshekonombank debt and MinFin bonds both firmed initially, but investors are nervous about the health of President Boris Yeltsin who is being treated in hospital for pneumonia.</p>
<p>The Kremlin earlier said he was breathing more easily but there had been no dramatic improvement in his condition.</p>
<p>News of his illness on Wednesday night initially knocked almost two points off the price of dollar Vneshekonombank, but there were enough enthusiasts wanting to buy at the cheaper levels to prompt a recovery.</p>
<p>However, this morning's initial gains were largely gone by lunchtime.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is hanging on every headline. We have to focus on the situation but to trade on every heartbeat doesn't make too much sense,&quot; one U.S. bank trader said.</p>
<p>Many in the market say that Yeltsin's continuation in office is less crucial to the future of the economy than it once was, though it remains important.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there is clearly a risk that any illness could be serious after his quintuple heart bypass, the markets have clearly over-reacted,&quot; said ANZ emerging markets analyst Jerome Booth.</p>
<p>&quot;The key issue is that (if Yeltsin leaves office) economic policy will be unchanged,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Next week, the market will also focus on the arrival of an International Monetary Fund mission in Moscow and whether it will recommend releasing delayed loans.</p>
<p>For today though, the wait for U.S. December non-farm payroll figures is stopping much Brady trading. &quot;The number is going to determine where this market goes,&quot; one trader said.</p>
