<title>USA: CBOT soy ends down, July lower as specs bail out.</title>
<headline>CBOT soy ends down, July lower as specs bail out.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-18</dateline>

<p>Volatile trade in CBOT soybeans shook more speculators out of the market and as a result, July soybeans ended with sharp losses Wednesday, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The funds came in this morning with the idea that they had to get out of July,&quot; said Jack Scoville, analyst with the Price Group in Chicago.</p>
<p>Commodity funds and local traders were heavy sellers in July throughout the day. An early tally put fund selling in soybeans at 15 million bushels, but traders said that figure would be higher once all was tallied.</p>
<p>The extreme volatility in July soybeans has made that contract less attractive to speculators, and many are washing out their positions, floor sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume's declining. Trade is very choppy and it's flushing specs (speculatives) out of the market,&quot; said one veteran trader. &quot;Locals and commericals are going to be the only ones left trading July.&quot;</p>
<p>New crop was pressured by good growing weather through much of the U.S. Midwest, traders said.</p>
<p>July ended 20-1/4 cents a bushel lower at $8.2-1/2, and other months settled down 3-1/2 to 11-3/4.  </p>
<p>However, some in the trade said that portions of Minnesota and the western Corn Belt could use some more rain.</p>
<p>Commercial firms were noted executing bear spreads. That trading activity led to speculation that firms were bringing soybeans to Chicago for delivery.</p>
<p>First notice day, when firms make public their intent to deliver soybeans against CBOT futures, is June 30 for the July contracts.</p>
<p>On the day Wednesday, Refco sold seven million bushels July and three million November and Prudential Securities sold 2.5 million July. Smith Barney bought four million bushels July.</p>
<p>In spread trade, Continental Grain spread 3.5 million December/July and E.D. and F. Man spread five million July/December, pit traders said.</p>
<p>In options trade, Term Commodities bought 600 August $8.00 calls and sold 600 August $8.25 calls. FIMAT Futures Inc. bought 800 November $7.25 calls.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 61,000 contracts, up from Tuesday's actual volume of 49,733 contracts.</p>
