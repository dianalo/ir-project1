<p>The global fight against malaria could have a new weapon with the discovery of an internal transport network within the host that might be used to starve or poison the parasite, researchers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>There is no vaccine against malaria, a parasitic ailment that affects more than 200 million people worldwide and kills about two million each year, including one million children.</p>
<p>Absent a vaccine, scientists focused on combating the disease with drugs. This new research opens a different avenue for attacking it from within, according to Kasturi Haldar of Stanford University, an author of research published in the latest edition of the journal Science.</p>
<p>The malaria parasite sets up shop in the red blood cells, where it is protected from attack by the body's immune system and some drugs. But the red blood cells do not provide enough food to nourish the parasite, so it must get food through a network of tubes that it constructs within the red blood cell.</p>
<p>&quot;What we've found is another target, a network that allows nutrients to be transported from outside the (red blood) cell, across the cell into the (malaria) parasite and we've found a way of breaking the pathway and starving the parasite,&quot; Haldar said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The network could also be used to channel poison into the parasite to kill it or make it ineffective, she said.</p>
<p>Scientists have believed for several years that such a transport network existed, and this latest research confirmed that.</p>
<p>Haldar's team has used the strategy of cutting the network on a rodent strain of malaria, which is similar but not identical to the human strain. Research is being done on laboratory rats, with the next step -- studies on primates -- at least a year away, Haldar said.</p>
<p>She said that it would likely be &quot;a couple of years&quot; before scientists know whether they can safely try the strategy on humans.</p>
<p>These kinds of treatment strategies have taken on increased importance as attempts to find a malaria vaccine have stalled.</p>
<p>One promising experimental vaccine aimed at the deadliest form of the disease, plasmodium flaciparum malaria, was tried on seven human volunteers, according to research published in January in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>Only one of the seven who were vaccinated got the disease, but researchers said more study was needed before the full potential of the vaccine was known.</p>
