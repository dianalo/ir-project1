<p>Carlos the Jackal has refused to answer questions about the shooting which allegedly launched his guerrilla career, telling a French anti-terrorism judge he could not reveal the secrets of his &quot;revolutionary organisation&quot;.</p>
<p>Justice sources said that Carlos, in a Paris jail since his arrest in Sudan two years ago, faced Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere on Tuesday to be quizzed for the first time about the 1975 killing of two French secret service agents in Paris.</p>
<p>Investigators plan to put Carlos on trial next year for shooting dead the unarmed agents and their Lebanese informer, and wounding a third agent, at a Latin Quarter flat.</p>
<p>Carlos was sentenced in his absence in 1992 to life in jail for the killings.</p>
<p>&quot;I belong to a revolutionary organisation and therefore I cannot tell you where I was at the time or tell you about events,&quot; a justice source quoted Carlos as repeatedly telling Bruguiere during a tense confrontation in the Palais de Justice.</p>
<p>The judge's questions focused on the whereabouts of the Venezuelan-born Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez Sanchez, at the time of the June 1975 shooting.</p>
<p>&quot;The judge's questions are getting longer and longer but Carlos won't talk. The judge can't stand Carlos any more,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>The Paris-based Al-Watan magazine quoted Carlos as bragging about the killings in a 1979 interview. But Carlos has denied giving the interview since his arrest, saying it was planted by an unspecified Arab country's secret service.</p>
<p>Witnesses have testifed that Carlos shot dead the two DST counter-espionage agents and an accomplice he apparently believed had betrayed him when the officers called at a flat in Toullier Street to check his identity.</p>
<p>The shooting forced Carlos into the shadows for nearly two decades until he was seized by the DST itself in Sudan in August 1994.</p>
<p>Carlos disputes experts' reports that his fingerprints were found at the Paris flat and that the type of pistol used indicates he was the killer, justice sources said.</p>
<p>The sources said Carlos's lawyer had demanded that three Venezuelan eyewitnesses, who were students and in the flat at the time, be questioned again about the incident.</p>
<p>Bruguiere abruptly put an end to the questioning shortly after 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) when a colleague rushed in to tell him of the bombing of a train at a regional express station in Paris, the sources said.</p>
<p>The blast which bore the hallmarks of Algerian Moslem fundamentalists killed two people and injured 79 others.</p>
<p>French police accuse Carlos of killing 83 people in a series of attacks in Europe and the Middle East. The boldest incident with which he was linked was the kidnapping of 11 OPEC oil ministers in Vienna in 1975.</p>
<p>Carlos is also under investigation for a series of attacks including a 1983 railway station bombing in Marseille, which killed two people, a bombing against a high speed train the same day in which two died, and an explosion on a Paris-Toulouse train in 1982 which killed five people.</p>
