<p>China is on target with plans to to promote 100 large chemical groups by 2000 by tapping a $1.6 billion war chest, Minister of Chemical Industry Gu Xiulian said on Friday.</p>
<p>The industry hoped that 10 of the groups, which are being groomed to compete in the export market, could eventually list their shares either on domestic or foreign stock exchanges, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, we have 13.6 billion yuan ($1.6 billion) to support development plans,&quot; Gu told reporters. &quot;Some of this was made available under the previous five-year plan (1991-1995). All of the money is to support development projects.&quot;</p>
<p>China has been trying to promote big companies to give its ailing state sector a more competitive edge.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the problems in the industry is that we've had too much small-scale production which was protected under central planning. But now we have a market economy,&quot; Gu said.</p>
<p>The government aimed to build up companies which could each export $10 million worth of chemicals a year. There were now 80 such companies, she added.</p>
<p>Asked about plans to publicly list the firms, Gu did not name any company or group but said the ministry's policy was to support companies ready to go public.</p>
<p>Listing plans would then require approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China's top securities watchdog.</p>
<p>Chemical companies Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry (Group) Co Ltd and Jilin Chemical Industry Co Ltd are some of the companies listed in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Gu said some of the state-run chemical companies were among the firms losing money, and that subsidiaries were needed to offset rising raw material costs. She did not mention any companies by name but said chemical fertilisers were one area where subsidiaries were necessary.</p>
