<p>Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin has refused a four-way television debate with the leaders of France's other parliamentary parties before next month's general election, a party official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Jospin, who agreed on Tuesday to the idea of a one-on-one debate with centre-right Prime Minister Alain Juppe, turned down an invitation from TF1 television to appear with UDF party leader Francois Leotard and Communist party leader Robert Hue as well as the prime minister, the official said.  </p>
<p>Juppe, Leotard and Hue all announced they had accepted the invitation for a debate on May 20, five days before the first round of voting. The second round is set for June 1.</p>
<p>At issue is the coalition's attempt to depict Jospin, leader of the largest opposition party, as dependent on the Communists to win a majority, while the Socialists are keen to focus the debate on Juppe's unpopular record.</p>
<p>A four-way debate could highlight differences between the Socialists and Communists on the key issue of a single European currency.</p>
<p>The Socialists are in favour of the euro, although they have set conditions and refused further austerity if needed to reach the strict budget deficit criterion for European monetary union. The Communists oppose a single currency and want a referendum on the issue.</p>
