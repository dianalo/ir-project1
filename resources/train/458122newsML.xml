<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- About 700 Karen civilians, many of them people who were pushed back to Burma late last month, are being blocked by the Army from crossing the frontier into the western province of Ratchaburi. Relief workers say the Karen have started to move toward the Thai border after Burmese Army troops pressed forward, seemingly bent on taking control of the whole area occupied by the refugees, who are concentrated around three small Burmese streams.

<p>- Senior members of the judiciary have thrown their weight behind calls for a corruption investigation into a judge who released a key drug suspect on bail. The development comes as Somchai Udomwong, the Appeals Court chief judge, declares himself ready for a Counter Corruption Commission examination of his assets. Somchai says the investigation will show he has no corrupt motive in approving the temporary release of Li Yun-chung, who jumped bail and is thought to be in Burma. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- Top Thai politicians, financial officials and a newspaper have been summoned to appear in a Canadian court following defamation lawsuits filed by Rakesh Saxena, key suspect in the Bangkok Bank of Commerce (BBC) scandal. Amnuay Yossuck, chairman of the House finance and banking committee, says he and seven individuals and legal entities have received the summons late last month and have to appear at the Canadian court within 42 days or the court could decide to proceed with the cases in their absence.

<p>- The central bank says it is seeking ways to get weak finance and securities firms it takes under its wings to merge in order to ease troubles in the ailing sector. As part of efforts to support the flagging sector, the central bank earlier this month identified 10 weakened finance firms hit by liquidity crunches and as part of a major revamp told them to increase their capital.

<p>- Thailand is to submit an official statement to the United States Trade Representative in an attempt to restore export privileges to 30 products. The restoration of the generalised system of preferences (GSP) is expected to compensate the country for rights to be lost on six products after GSP cuts later this year. (THE NATION)</p>
