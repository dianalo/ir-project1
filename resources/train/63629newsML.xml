<title>UK: Welsh Anglicans lift ban on women priests.</title>

<p>Leaders of the Welsh Anglican church on Thursday voted by the narrowest of margins to lift the ban on women becoming priests.</p>
<p>The Church in Wales, which was the only Anglican church in Britain still barring women from the priesthood, approved the move by just one vote at a tense meeting of its governing body held in Lampeter, south Wales.</p>
<p>A bill to allow women priests just reached its necessary two-thirds majority among lay members and the clergy.</p>
<p>The six Welsh bishops were all in favour of the reform following changes made by the Church in England, Scotland and Ireland. The Church of England approved the ordination of women in 1992.</p>
<p>The vote will allow nearly 80 Welsh women deacons to become priests.</p>
<p>Of the Anglican communion's 37 self-governing churches around the world, 17 ordain women priests. These churches account for about half of the world's 80 million Anglicans.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Archbishop of Wales, the Rt Rev Alwyn Rice-Jones, said continued opposition to women priests would leave Welsh Anglicans isolated and split within the Church.</p>
<p>&quot;We will simply slide backwards and nobody will be prepared to listen to us. We will just be a forgotten province of the Anglican Church.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside the meeting, jubilant women deacons hugged one another as they celebrated the breakthrough.</p>
<p>Many had threatened to leave the Welsh Church and move to England because of their frustration at not being ordained.</p>
<p>Many have been deacons since 1980, when the Church in Wales first opened its doors to women clergy.</p>
