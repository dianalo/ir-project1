<p>The Canadian dollar will have difficulty strengthening in the coming year because of falling levels of foreign-held Canadian government debt, CIBC Wood Gundy Securities predicted on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based brokerage said in a report that a record C$22 billion in foreign held securities would come due next year and many foreigners would opt to repatriate those funds.</p>
<p>&quot;With foreigners increasingly selling our dollar as they convert proceeds from maturing Canadian bonds into their own currencies, any substantial Canadian dollar strengthening would prove difficult in the coming year,&quot; CIBC Wood Gundy senior economist Avery Shenfeld said in a statement.</p>
<p>Overall levels of foreign-held Canadian debt would drop in coming years, the brokerage predicted. It said Canada's foreign-held debt would fall to less than 33 percent of gross domestic product in the next four years from a high of 45 percent in 1993.</p>
<p>Since Canadian interest rates were now lower than U.S. rates, CIBC Wood Gundy said foreign lenders would not be eager to roll funds from maturing bonds into new Canadian issues.</p>
<p>The brokerage expects two main factors to help keep Canadian interest rates below U.S. rates in the coming year. One is that federal government bond issuance, which reached a record C$32 billion in net financing in 1996/97, will plunge in 1998/99 when C$9 billion more bonds retire than are issued.</p>
<p>Growing savings and investment by Canadians should also help keep interest rates below U.S. rates, the report said.</p>
<p>Higher savings &quot;should enable domestic investors to increase their ownership share of government debt just as foreigners cut back. That will allow Canadian interest rates to remain well below those in the U.S. next year,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report also predicted that next year new corporate borrowing in the Canadian market would exceed government activity for the first time in three decades.</p>
