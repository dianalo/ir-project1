<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - Analysts were asked their latest estimates for gross domestic product for the September quarter. Estimates have been nudged lower in recent weeks as both real retail sales and exports have proved less robust that expected. The quarterly result will still be up on the 0.1 percent rise recorded in Q2, but annual growth will slow sharply to around 3.0 percent from the unconvincingly strong 4.5 percent seen in  </p>
<p>the June quarter. The forecast is very preliminary with company profits, business investment and stocks all yet to come.</p>

<p>IMPORTS - Economists' forecasts were fairly wide ranging with some expecting a minor correction after the 0.5 and 1.2 percent rises in the previous two months. However, others are anticipating a pick up in consumer imports in the wake of the cut in official interest rates on July 31. There is also the possibility of an aircraft being included, amounting to some A$45 million. However, the key part of the data will be the strength, or otherwise, of capital imports which have tailed off in the last few months. Further weakness would bring into question the government's upbeat expectations of 14 percent growth in business investment for 1996/97.  </p>
<p>COMPANY PROFITS - Important since they feed into the gross operating surlpus of the GDP accounts, but disliked by analysts for their extreme volatility and corresponding difficulty in estimating accurately. That was reflected in the spread of forecasts which ranged from a 3.0 percent fall to a 2.5 percent rise and analysts readily admitted they would not be surprised if the actual result was well outside that band. Analysts noted the outcome would also show whether the pressure on profit margins which had contributed to the slowdown in inflation seen this year, had continued into the third quarter.  </p>
