<p>Brian Lara illuminated the damp fourth test between West Indies and India with a classic unbeaten 77 as the home side reached 181 for four at tea on the fourth day.</p>
<p>With play finally possible after three waterlogged days, Lara accepted the chance to spend some time at the crease beneath clear blue skies, in contrast to the majority of his team-mates.</p>
<p>It took the Trinidadian left-hander 25 balls to get off the mark and he was forced to graft for over an hour before lunch for just eight runs on the ground where he made his world record 375 against England three years ago.</p>
<p>But in the two hours after the interval Lara cast off the shackles with some marvellous strokes, justifying his captain Courtney Walsh's unsurprising decision to bat first after winning the delayed toss.</p>
<p>West Indies had earlier lost their first three wickets for 40, including Sherwin Campbell run out for 10 by a brilliant direct hit from Ajay Jadeja.</p>
<p>Carl Hooper struck Sunil Joshi for a huge straight six but fell to the same bowler for 26, brilliantly caught low down by Mohammad Azharuddin at slip, to leave West Indies on 82 for four.</p>
<p>It was Azharuddin's ninth catch of the series and his 88th in 82 tests, but Roland Holder contributed an unbeaten 34 to help Lara add 119 runs in the afternoon session.</p>
