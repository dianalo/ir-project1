<p>Steady commission house buying drove London's October white sugar contract to a fresh life high on Monday morning but other players were quick to move in and take profits, traders said.</p>
<p>One major commission house was said to have led the morning's buying spree, thought to be on behalf of fund clients, with the gains then capped by trade and brokers.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very good resistance at $331...maybe it's done what it wants to do for the moment,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>October rallied to a new high of $331.00 after moving in a range of $2.00. Other positions also gained ground.</p>
<p>Traders said they were continuing to monitor the build-up in fund positions in the London market.</p>
<p>At 1100 GMT October was up $1.40 at $330.10 and December up $1.00 at $324.30. Volume was concentrated in the spot contract and amounted to 683 lots.</p>
<p>The Paris market was also strong but volume was on the light side at just 140 lots. October was up 80 cents at $329.80 and December up 30 cents at $323.30. --Jeremy Smith, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8064</p>
