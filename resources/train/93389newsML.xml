<p>NARODNA OBRODA - Slovak bank Dopravna Banka a.s. has bought the 12-branch Slovak network of troubled Czech bank Ekoagrobanka a.s.</p>
<p>- The country's O-T-C bourse RM-System (RMS), the organiser of trading in privatisation bonds, has temporarily banned trading with the bonds in cases when financial settlements were to be carried out outside the RMS. The bourse said the move should stop trading with bonds for prices lower than the state-guaranteed minimum price of 7,500 crowns.</p>
<p>- Building society VUB Wustenrot said it was ready to extend loans for housing purposes totalling some 1.3 billion crowns by the end of this year.</p>
<p>- Holiday Inn will open its first Slovak hotel in Bratislava on Friday.</p>
<p>PRAVDA - There is no evidence to suggest that the Slovak banking sector is threatened with the kind of problems seen in the Czech Republic, said Jozef Mudrik, Vice-governor of the National Bank of Slovakia.</p>
<p>- Mudrik warned that the fast pace of development in the Slovak banking sector may change the current positive situation, and said the goal was to ensure transparency in the acquisition of bank shares.</p>
<p>- Mudrik said the establishment of new banks was not ruled out, but added that their number should not increase radically.</p>
<p>- The NBS repeated that it would support the sale of the troubled Czech Agrobanka to a Slovak bank.</p>
<p>HOSPODARSKE NOVINY - Agriculture minister Peter Baco said he did not expect a &quot;radical increase&quot; in food prices, but that some correction in prices may come due to increases in energy prices and some other production factors. -- Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-563-3687</p>
