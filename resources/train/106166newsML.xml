<p>Turkey is planning to spend $150 billion over 30 years until the year 2030 for projects to modernise its army, a senior defence official said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The total value of projects proposed to modernise the Turkish Armed Forces by 2030 is about $150 billion,&quot; said the senior official, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>He said the government would spend about $5 billion each year for the projects, which he declined to give details on.</p>
<p>&quot;Turkey is already spending about $2.5 to $3 billion every year for defence and we are targeting to double appropriations allocated to the defence industry through increases in the defence industry fund and the budget,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also told her party meeting on Wednesday that Turkey planned investments worth $150 billion for defence but she did not give any other details.</p>
<p>Turkey, which has the second biggest army in NATO after the United States, has almost completed a $10-billion defence industry plan, which it began in 1986 to modernise its army.</p>
<p>The plan included equipping the army with modern weapons, producing fighter aircraft and electronic warfare equipment.</p>
