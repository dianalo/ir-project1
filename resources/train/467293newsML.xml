<p>French electrical distribution company Schneider is expected to report 1996 net attributable profit around 1.25 billion francs on Wednesday, up from 817 million a year ago, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the real growth in margins and profits are expected this year as construction firm Spie Batignolles leaves the group and the effects of Schneider's focus on core activities are felt.</p>
<p>Schneider last month confirmed the sale of 58 percent of Spie to its unit's employees, and the rest to Britain's Amec Plc, for 350 million francs.</p>
<p>Schneider will also eventually receive one billion francs the sale of its 50 percent stake in Spie Trindel, an electrical installation firm, to Spie Batignolles, which owns the other 50 percent.</p>
<p>Consultancy Jacques Chahine Finances has a consensus estimate of 1.248 billion francs for net attributable profit, down from a September forecast of 1.298 billion, and a range going from 1.137 billion to 1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Schneider reported last month 1996 sales up 3.7 percent to 61.615 billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;This announcement was a nice surprise to the market, which was not expecting such as a strong increase,&quot; said an analyst at brokerage Wargny.</p>
<p>&quot;The volume effects, particularly in North America with Square D, and in Asia and central Europe, should have an impact on the results,&quot; said the analyst, who is very positive on the stock and is forecasting 1.2 billion francs in profit before goodwill writedown.</p>
<p>He believes the group's fundamentals are good and it has organised its core electrical construction and electromechanical businesses around three well-defined subsidiaries - Square D, Telemecanique and Merlin Gerin.</p>
<p>This analyst is pencilling in a clear increase in 1997 operating margins, and a profit advance of around 20 percent on a like-for-like basis.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend in the sector is favourable and the re-focusing has taken place. The operating margin should be between eight and 10 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another analyst, who declined to be named, expects the Spie sale will have an automatic improvement in margins. She added that the Schneider 2000 restructuring plan should quickly show the benefits.</p>
<p>She is forecasting a net profit of 1.25 billion francs, including goodwill writedown, for 1996 and 1.6 billion in 1997. Excluding Spie, sales should increase between five and six percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The group, now that it is re-focused and the strategy has been clarified, should show profitability in line with the sector,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Schneider sold 71 percent of its 100 percent holding in ME UPS systems, a maker of thyratron inverters, last September. The firm makes devices to prevent interruption of electricity supply to electronic equipment.</p>
<p>Schneider stock was up 1.73 percent at 299.70 francs at 1516 GMT, while the market was up 0.92 percent.</p>
