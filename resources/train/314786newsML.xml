<p>Most Peruvians approve of President Alberto Fujimori's handling of a 31-day hostage crisis, agreeing he should seek a bloodless solution that does not involve freeing any jailed rebels, a poll said on Friday.</p>
<p>Local television reported a Compania Peruana de Investigacion de Mercados (CPI) survey showed an overwhelming 93 percent wanted Fujimori to look for a peaceful end to the siege and 88 percent said no rebels should be released.</p>
<p>The main demand of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holding 74 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence is the freeing of some 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>The CPI survey of 450 adults in Lima, conducted Jan. 13-14, also said 66 percent believed Fujimori's handling of the crisis was &quot;correct,&quot; while 23 percent disagreed and 11 percent held no opinion.</p>
<p>His &quot;firm but prudent&quot; handling of the siege has helped Fujimori to recover some of his falling popularity. For the first time in months the president's approval rating rose, climbing to 50 percent from 45 percent in December, according to the poll.</p>
<p>Fujimori has flatly rejected the rebels' demand for prisoner releases. He has said he will look for a peaceful solution to the 31-day siege but will not rule out using force until the hostage takers lay down their arms and free all their captives.</p>
<p>While many Peruvians have found that the MRTA's complaints about poverty in Peru ring true, there has been general disgust at their methods.</p>
<p>Since taking office in 1990, the president had held high popularity ratings due to the perceived virtual defeat of communist guerrillas, economic reforms and a strong, personalized leadership style.</p>
<p>But last year his popularity plummeted to its lowest level in five years. The administration's failure to reduce high levels of poverty and unemployment, Fujimori's perceived authoritarianism, and his possible bid for a third term took a toll on his popularity, analysts said.</p>
<p>According to a Constitutional Court ruling on Thursday Fujimori is free to run for an unprecedented third term in 2000. The court decided a bid to stop Fujimori standing on legal grounds was &quot;unfounded.&quot;</p>
