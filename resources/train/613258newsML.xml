<p>World number one Pete Sampras enjoyed a perfect start to his latest French Open quest on Monday with a first round performance which dispelled any complacency among his specialist clay-court rivals.</p>
<p>Sampras, the top seed, brushed aside the potentially awkward local challenge of Fabrice Santoro 6-3 7-5 6-1 and showed sufficient authority to suggest he could yet collect the only Grand Slam title he has never won.</p>
<p>Santoro has beaten recent French champions Thomas Muster and Sergi Bruguera this year, but was never allowed into his stride by the American who scarcely looked like a man without a prior win on his least favourite surface this year.</p>
<p>On a glorious day at Roland Garros, there were also encouraging early victories for defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov, a straight sets winner over Martin Damm of the Czech Republic, and in-form Spaniard Alex Corretja.</p>
<p>The eighth seed beat Moroccan Karim Alami 6-3 6-4 6-1 to launch what is expected to be a strong Spanish challenge but, among the early starters, it was Sampras who provided most food for thought.</p>
<p>Back on court after withdrawing from last week's World Team Cup with a thigh injury, the reigning U.S. and Australian Open champion might have wished for an easier start than a centre court match against the 57th-ranked Santoro, a semifinalist in Monte Carlo and Prague inside the last month.</p>
<p>The size of the crowd indicated what French spectators thought might happen, but once Sampras had taken the first set in 32 minutes, he grew steadily in confidence and gave his opponent little room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>The only real wobble came in the eighth game when a nifty backhand gave Santoro a break point for 5-3 but his failure to take advantage cost him dear.</p>
<p>&quot;He served very well and when he does that it is very difficult,&quot; said Santoro, reflecting on the one hour 56 minute contest. &quot;He sunk me game after game.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good start for me on clay,&quot; acknowledged Sampras, beaten twice on the surface by Santoro. &quot;It's a tough draw when you play a Frenchman on centre court but you just have to go out there and play.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the only tournament I haven't won so I'll do whatever I can do win here. It's the only thing left for me to achieve.&quot;</p>
<p>The French Open, however, continues to pose Sampras, who has nine Grand Slam singles titles, difficulties he doesn't face in any other major championship.</p>
<p>&quot;The French is tougher on the mind and the body. It doesn't come quite so easy for me on clay. It's not really tennis, it's more of a fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Kafelnikov, who has missed three months of the year with a broken finger, also expressed cautious optimism after his 6-2 6-4 6-4 success against Damm.</p>
<p>The basking crowd were so subdued the Russian was unconvinced they knew who he was, but the third seed is determined to remind them of his talents in the coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;I was looking in a magazine yesterday and saw my chances rated at two percent,&quot; smiled Kafelnikov. &quot;I just want to prove I'm not as bad as everyone thinks.&quot;</p>
<p>In the women's singles, three-time French champion Monica Seles beat Japan's Miho Saeki 6-0 6-3 while Spain's Conchita Martinez defeated Emilie Loit 4-6 6-2 6-3.</p>
<p>The day's most dazzling debut belonged to 16-year-old American Venus Williams, whose shimmering silver tennis dress and strings of white beads in her hair ensured she stood out from the crowd.</p>
<p>When she lost the second set tie-break to Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu, however, it seemed as though Venus might be making only a brief appearance but she dug in to win 6-2 6-7 7-5 in two hours 37 minutes.</p>
