<headline>Iraqi paper lauds France over U.S.-led air force.</headline>
<dateline>BAGHDAD 1996-12-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>An official Iraqi newspaper on Friday praised France after Turkish reports that Paris would withdraw its support for a U.S.-led air force patrolling the skies of northern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;The French move would enhance ties...with Iraq not only on the political level, but by boosting comprehensive relations that both sides are willing to bring back to their past (pre-Gulf War) level,&quot; said al-Thawra, organ of the ruling Baath party.</p>
<p>A Turkish foreign ministy official said on Wednesday that France had decided to hold back support for the U.S., French and British air force which has been shielding Iraq's Kurds from possible attacks from Baghdad since after the end of the 1991 Gulf War which ejected Iraqi troops from Kuwait.</p>
<p>France has not confirmed this. The French foreign ministry said this week that Paris would make its decision known at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Turkish MPs voted on Wednesday to give Islamist Prime Minsiter Necmettin Erbakan's goverment the power to authorise continued flights over northern Iraq after the mandate for the current operation, known as Provide Comfort, expires on December 31.</p>
<p>Iraq condemned Turkey on Thursday for allowing the allied planes to continue their operations in northern Iraq for six months more and Thawra said: &quot;The Turkish decision...smells of a conspiracy against Iraq.&quot;</p>
<p>In Washington, the White House said it was confident that France would soon rejoin the operation.</p>
<p>&quot;The French move would lead the world to drive the fact that the activities of the 'Hammer Force' are illegal,&quot; the Iraqi paper said.</p>
<p>Paris, eager to help exploit Iraqi oil resources, has courted Baghdad's favour and pressed for an end to United Nations trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
