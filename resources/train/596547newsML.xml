<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on Monday supported Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan's plan to cut the 1997/1998 national budget, saying belt tightening was needed to sustain a balanced, deficit-free budget policy.</p>
<p>Chavalit reaffirmed Amnuay's budget cut announcement made on Saturday by estimating that the government would cut spending next year by at least 20 billion baht ($769 million).  </p>
<p>Amnuay said earlier he would propose a 26 billion baht cut in the budget for 1997/1998 (October/September) expenditure, trimming it to 982 billion.</p>
<p>The prime minister, seeking to calm the concerns of some of his coalition partners that infrastructure projects they had initiated may be affected by fresh budget cuts, said the belt tightening does not mean all infrastructure projects would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>&quot;We are committed to the balanced (deficit-free) budget policy...belt tightening is essential, for example on shortening foreign trips made by government officials,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Chavalit said his government could not give civil servants a special five percent salary hike soon without affecting its fiscal discipline.</p>
<p>Thailand is planning to cut its national budget for the second year in a row as its sharply slowing economy has reduced tax revenue, making it difficult for the government to keep its deficit-free policy.</p>
