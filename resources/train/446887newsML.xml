<p>Stock markets in Brazil and Venezuela were seen firm this week despite the rollercoaster ride on Wall Street, while Chile was likely to find its feet, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Mexican and Argentine bolsas, however, were seen very volatile ahead of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meeting March 25.</p>
<p>Brazil was seen immune to the Fed jitters, with gains of over 30 percent so far this year still not luring profit-takers, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Despite the sharp rally so far this year, the market is showing no signs that it will weaken,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>However, analysts noted the market could suffer if Brazil's high court rules against plans to privatize the telecommunications sector. They said upcoming concessions to run cellular services could be put on hold if the Supreme Federal Tribunal court agrees with the challenge presented by left-wing parties.</p>
<p>Brazilian shares ended the week with a rise of 3.5 percent at 9,499 points on the Bovespa index.</p>
<p>Venezuelan stocks were also seen continuing to rise after confidence returned Friday to Caracas's battered bolsa on news of utility rate increases, which favored market leaders.</p>
<p>Last week, the bourse's 19-share index closed off 2.4 percent at 6390.78 points. It pared early losses of five percent on fears that second quarter rate increases would be delayed for telephone company CANTV.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong performance of CANTV in recent days is emblematic of the overdue resurgence of interest in Venezuelan equities,&quot; said New York based IDEA in a market comment.  </p>
<p>The government approved CANTV's 4.18 percent rate hike late Thursday. And with a rate increase also seen imminent for utility Electricidad de Caracas -- the most heavily traded stock -- brokers said the bolsa should rise.</p>
<p>In Argentina, the downward trend was expected to continue, at least for a few more days.</p>
<p>&quot;Argentine stocks will probably keep sliding at the beginning of the week with scant volume, because they are being held in check by Wall Street,&quot; said Daro Lizzano, head of research at Banco Santander.  </p>
<p>The Buenos Aires bolsa's blue-chip MerVal index fell 2.6 percent last week to 711.7 and showed a slight loss in March after several months of gains.</p>
<p>Traders said the MerVal would find support at 700, but could slip down to 690 if the U.S. outlook worsened.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is still very hard to call,&quot; said Gabriel Ruiz at brokers Tavelli. &quot;A lot depends on Wednesday's U.S. consumer price index, and we should have a more accurate reading of the market by Friday.&quot;  </p>
<p>In Mexico, stocks were seen erratic and thinly traded, with local speculators dominating trade and institutional players sitting on the sidelines ahead of the Fed's March 25 decision on interest rates.</p>
<p>The leading index dropped 1.8 percent last week to 3775.71, hurt by a rise in local interest rates and the U.S. House of Representatives vote to censure Mexico, giving it 90 days to show it has improved its performance as an ally in the war against drugs. The Senate is due to vote on the issue this week.  </p>
<p>Traders said beyond the Fed factor, next week's Easter break would keep the bolsa trendless until the first days of April.</p>
<p>Chilean stocks were seen breaking away from Wall Street and trading more calmly, with investors hoping for signs the Central Bank will trim interest rates soon, said traders.</p>
<p>&quot;This week will be a little quieter. There's not a lot of news out there moving the market,&quot; said Lance Eckel, an analyst at brokerage Sud Americano.</p>
<p>Investors are speculating the bank may cut rates by 0.25 point in April provided there is no unexpected jump in March inflation. The bank unexpectedly trimmed rates last month and said more cuts are likely if the economy remains on course.</p>
<p>Traders said blue chips were trading at the bottom of their technical range of 115-118 on the selective index, which shed 0.8 percent last week to 116.07 points.</p>
