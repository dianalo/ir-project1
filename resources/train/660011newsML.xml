<p>Pakistan proposed on Friday that the United States and Russia guarantee decisions that may be made in proposed talks on ending the Afghan conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan proposes to host an intra-Afghan meeting in Islamabad under U.N. auspices and with the participation of countries sharing land borders with Afghanistan as well as Russia and the United States,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;The decisions of the intra-Afghan moot could be guaranteed by the United States and Russia to provide funds for the reconstruction of Afghanistan as an incentive for the Afghan leaders to implement the decisions which they themselves have reached,&quot; a ministry statement said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The statement followed an announcement by Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan at a news conference on Thursday that Islamabad planned to hold a meeting of five immediate neighbours of Afghanistan -- Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- with the United States and Russia attending as observers.</p>
<p>The ministry's statement said Pakistan was sounding out Afghan warring groups and was in touch with neighbouring countries about the proposed meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our conviction that a solution of the Afghan problem has to emerge from the Afghans themselves. The Afghans would not accept any solution imposed on them from outside.&quot;</p>
<p>It said Pakistan hoped an intra-Afghan dialogue would provide a useful forum for Afghan leaders to &quot;achieve national reconciliation for the establishment of a government in which all ethnic groups are represented&quot;.</p>
<p>Khan said on Thursday he would make a two-day tour of Central Asian countries next week to discuss the conference plan while Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif would also touch on the subject with Iranian leaders when he visits Tehran on June 16-17.</p>
<p>Pakistan recognised the government of the Taleban Islamic movement in Afghanistan late last month, followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Pakistan is accused by opposition factions of helping the mainly ethnic Pashtun Taleban militia, which controls more than two-thirds of the country.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman on Friday denied reports by some Afghan opposition factions that Pakistanis were among Taleban fighters captured in recent fighting in the north.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no Pakistani combatants in Afghanistan,&quot; he told reporters at a news briefing. He said the reports may have been prompted by Taleban fighters who spoke Urdu -- the principal language of Pakistan -- which they learned during their Islamic studies in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Taleban movement was born among Afghan war refugees studying in Pakistan Islamic schools.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in New York on Thursday that the Afghan conflict would not end even if one side took control of the entire country.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that there is no military solution to the situation in Afghanistan. And even if one party were to take the entire country, it does not mean that the quarrel is over,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are other minority elements within the society that will continue to resist from within and without. And this is why we have been trying to get the parties to accept a broad-based government and power-sharing, to be able to bring peace to Afghanistan.&quot;</p>
