<headline>Poll points to clear LDP majority in Japan election.</headline>

<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is likely to win a clear parliamentary majority in Japan's general election on Sunday, a newspaper survey released on Tuesday found.</p>
<p>A nationwide poll of 150,000 eligible voters conducted by the business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun at the weekend showed the LDP would win a simple majority of 251 seats in the 500-seat chamber.</p>
<p>Such a result would return the party to the position of sole power it held for nearly four decades until 1993.</p>
<p>The party held 211 seats in the Lower House when it was dissolved earlier this month. The LDP shared power in the outgoing coalition.</p>
<p>The survey found that Japan's main opposition group, Shinshinto (the New Frontier Party), would struggle to maintain its level of 160 seats.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party, formed last month by defectors from the two smaller parties that were in the ruling coalition with the LDP, would win 52 seats, it said.</p>
<p>Most analysts had predicted that no one party would win a clear majority and that a new coalition would have to be formed.</p>
<p>The polls will be the first to be held under a new electoral system in which the 300 members of the powerful Lower House will be chosen in single-seat constituencies, while 200 will be elected through proportional representation.</p>
<p>A record 1,503 candidates are running.</p>
