<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo has sold diamonds from the MIBA mine in Mbuji-Mayi to Antwerp-based Susskind, the first time in manny years it has dealt with a firm other than South Africa's De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.</p>
<p>Maurice Nabahola, an adviser to the minister of mines, told Reuters on Wednesday that Susskind had outbid De Beers and International Diamond Company at an auction last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The June production (of diamonds) went to the highest bidder. The sale by auction is synonymous with competition. Susskind Diamonds put up much more money than the rest of the competitors. We had to accept the best offer,&quot; Nabahola said.</p>
<p>De Beers has been the sole purchaser of diamonds from MIBA in the former Zaire for over a decade.</p>
<p>&quot;The state reached an agreement with De Beers in 1984. It was said that the MIBA diamonds would be sold only to De Beers,&quot; a MIBA director said.</p>
<p>But officials at the mining ministry said the South African company had enjoyed only a de facto monopoly.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been looking for the contract under which they were virtually the only company to purchase MIBA's diamonds, but in vain. If by any chance we find it, it will be terminated, for sure,&quot; said an official who declined to be named.</p>
<p>MIBA's monthly production of diamonds has been hovering at about 540,000 carats in the past few months.</p>
<p>Nabahola said that in June Miba produced more industrial stones than in earlier months this year and that receipts for these rose to about $7 million from nearly $6.5 million in May.</p>
<p>&quot;The short-term objective is 700,000 carats. But there are still many obstacles. We have to buy new (dredging) equipment for instance,&quot; Nabahola said.</p>
<p>Despite its riches, including the largest portion of the continent's tropical forest, a mighty river and a wide range of minerals, the former Zaire has been impoverished as a result of decades of economic anarchy under the reign of ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Since wresting power from dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May, President Laurent Kabila has held talks with many mining houses interested in exploiting the large reserves of copper, cobalt, zinc, tin, gold and diamonds in Africa's third biggest country.</p>
<p>All agreements signed during the Mobutu era are under review, and will be either cancelled or renegotiated.</p>
<p>Mines minister Mututulo Kambale has said foreign investors would be encouraged to enter partnerships with Congolese nationals, and they will have to show some concern for social development as well as profits.</p>
<p>Kabila's government has said that it is committed to a social market economy, but it remains unclear what the degree of state involvement will be.</p>
