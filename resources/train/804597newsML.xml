<p>Crewmen on a Panamanian-registered cargo vessel sailing from Hong Kong to Vietnam were forced to abandon ship after it caught fire near the territory on Sunday, local officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fire has spread to the accommodation and the rest of the ship and the master decided to abandon the vessel,&quot; R.N. Dewan, a rescue co-ordinator, told local radio.</p>
<p>Hong Kong rescue helicopters had earlier picked up 13 Burmese crewmen from the 5,300-tonne cargo ship, an official told Reuters. The vessel was outside Hong Kong waters, about 47 nautical miles southwest of Waglan Island, southeast of Hong Kong, the official said.</p>
<p>The local maritime rescue centre received a call before dawn that the engine room of the ship, which has a crew of 24, had caught fire, the government spokesman said.</p>
<p>After the rescue ships arrived and took some crew off the ship, some crew members decided the fire was under control and opted to stay on board. But hours later the blaze was once again out of control, he said.</p>
<p>Officials said they decided to abandon ship and were picked up at about noon by a nearby vessel en route to the southern Chinese town of Zhuhai.</p>
<p>&quot;And the remaining 11 crew, along with the master, were picked up by a nearby vessel. And the vessel is now proceeding to Zhuhai. The vessel is still afloat and it's burning. The position is about 50 miles southwest of Hong Kong,&quot; Dewan said.</p>
<p>He said he knew of no injuries in the fire. &quot;To the best of my knowledge, nobody is injured.&quot;</p>
<p>The cause of the fire was not immediately known. The crew were all Burmese, apart from one Hong Kong man and one Indonesian, he said.</p>
