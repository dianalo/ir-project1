<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Tuesday that France's place in a single European currency could be endangered if a Socialist-Communist government shared power with conservative President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>In a radio interview five days before the first round of a parliamentary election, the centre-right Juppe warned voters of the risk of institutional paralysis and economic disruption if the left-wing opposition won a majority.</p>
<p>&quot;Cohabitation&quot; -- the name the French give to power-sharing between a president and a government of different parties -- would be an obstacle to European integration and economic growth, he told RTL radio.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a shambles in Europe, firstly because the Socialists and Communists don't agree among themselves...and also because the Socialists' economic policy, with extra spending and deficits, would push us out of the lane for European (monetary) union,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made conditions so that the euro will succeed. I rather have the feeling that (Socialist leader) Lionel Jospin is making conditions so it will fail,&quot; Juppe said.</p>
<p>However, he proceeded to set out preferred conditions for joining the single European currency which were almost identical to the Socialists' terms, including the establishment of an &quot;economic government&quot; alongside the independent central bank.</p>
<p>He said the planned euro currency must have a &quot;realistic&quot; parity against the dollar, based on economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>A realistic dollar exchange rate was one condition for the euro to become an &quot;instrument for growth&quot; after the launch of European monetary union in 1999, Juppe said.</p>
