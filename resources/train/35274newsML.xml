<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Thursday warned Ireland, the current EU president, not to send an EU delegation to visit the PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Levy said before talks with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring that his government would welcome a fact-finding mission by an EU troika to Israel, but object if it tried to hold talks with the PLO at Orient House in disputed East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A similar visit by Spring during a Middle East visit in 1995 caused a diplomatic row between Israel and Ireland and the cancellation of talks between Spring and President Ezer Weizman.</p>
<p>Levy, the first Israeli minister to visit Ireland, was speaking to reporters during a five-nation European tour to brief key governments on the latest Israeli thinking on Middle East peace.</p>
<p>Levy said Palestine Liberation Organisation President Yasser Arafat accepted that the political institutions of the Palestinian Authority were not in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to see the troika but...we have reached an agreement that the political institutions of the Palestinians are no longer to be located in Jerusalem,&quot; Levy said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are asking the troika to respect that agreement between Israel and the Palestinians,&quot; Levy said. &quot;Why would they not respect it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So we need to be reassured. We will receive them as friends but they have to respect the agreement we signed with Arafat.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring has not made clear whether the troika will try to visit Orient House on its visit, a date for which has yet to be fixed.</p>
<p>The issue is expected to be discussed when Spring chairs an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Tralee, southern Ireland, at the weekend.</p>
<p>Levy is due to travel to London, Paris and Bonn after his visit to Ireland.</p>
<p>Arafat took a firm stand on Jerusalem in a speech in Rome on Thursday shortly after Levy left for Dublin.</p>
<p>He said the issue of its status &quot;could either make the peace process fall or become a symbol of co-existence and harmony between Moslems, Christians and Jews&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;To insist on saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel is a fact that is contrary to truth and reality, besides being a violation of a (U.N.) resolution and international law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israel declared Jerusalem its &quot;united and eternal&quot; capital in 1980, 13 years after its forces captured the city's Arab eastern sector from Jordan in the Six-Day War.</p>
