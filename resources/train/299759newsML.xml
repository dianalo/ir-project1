<p>&quot;December was another good month for Midwest Express,&quot; Timothy Hoeksema, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;We recorded a 15.8 percent increase in traffic on a 12.2 percent increase in capacity -- thanks in part to the post-Thanksgiving rush, which took place in December this year.&quot;</p>

<p>The company said Midwest Express' load factor for the year dropped due to new service added in May and September, which increased capacity but resulted in the decline in load factor.</p>
<p>Midwest Express' revenue passsenger miles for the year rose 7.8 percent to 1.24 billion and Skyway's gained 7.2 percent to 71.2 million. Available seat miles for the year for Midwest Express rose 8.9 percent to 1.95 billion and for Skyway gained 2.8 percent to 160.5 million.</p>
<p>He said both Midwest Express and the industry benefited from strong demand and overall favorable yields throughout the year. At the same time, fuel prices for Midwest Express increased 24 percent year over year.</p>
