<title>JAPAN: Dollar seen edging lower vs yen in Asia.</title>

<p>The dollar is likely to drift lower against the yen in Asia on Tuesday amid lingering worries about Japan's ballooning trade surplus, dealers said.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency, however, is expected to remain in a relatively narrow range versus the mark after European Union (EU) finance ministers reached a compromise deal on Monday on limiting budget deficits after the launch of Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;With uncertainties about the EU stability pact out of the way, the market's focus is likely to shift back to U.S.-Japan trade,&quot; said a trust bank trader.  </p>
<p>Dealers are focusing on Japan's May customs-cleared trade data due out on Wednesday and U.S. April international trade data on Thursday.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters forecast, on average, that Japan's May trade surplus rose to 548.5 billion yen, from a surplus of 229 billion yen a year earlier.</p>
<p>Forecasts ranged from 400 billion yen to 760 billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the last few days, the market has confirmed that dollar/yen is quite top-heavy at 115 yen. Hence, we may test the downside ahead of the trade data and G7 summit,&quot; said a city bank trader.  </p>
<p>Offers from Japanese exporters above 115.00 yen were heavy, dealers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japanese institutional investors so far have not shown much dollar-buying interest, though they might come in near 112 yen, a trust bank trader said.</p>
<p>The mark is also likely to remain under downward pressure against the Japanese currency, as some Japanese exporters are falling behind schedule in selling marks for the yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen ended Monday's New York trade lower after fears about Japan's trade surplus took hold.  </p>
<p>The greenback also ended down against the German currency in New York on Monday as profit-taking set in after the EU finance ministers reached a compromise deal on the stability pact.</p>
<p>The dollar rallied versus the mark last week in anticipation of an accord on the stability pact.</p>
<p>The deal raised the odds that the single European currency would be launched as planned in January 1999, possibly with a easier entry criteria, dealers said.</p>
