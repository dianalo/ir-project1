<text>
<p>South African hotel firm Don Group Ltd said on Monday that it had agreed to sell its food interests to various buyers for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>The firm also announced that it would launch a right issue of shares to raise 65 million rand in order to cut its debt.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the disposal of the food interests, the group will have removed a loss-incurring burden while the planned rights issue would immediately reduce gearing and interest charges amounting to 12 million rand annually,&quot; director Paul Nash in a statement.</p>
<p>He said the company expected better financial results for 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;The pick up in occupancies as well as strong forward bookings for the rest of the year is encouraging,&quot; added Nash, who is also managing director of Don Group's 40 percent shareholder Sable Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>The group posted earnings per share of 30.39 cents for the year to June 30, 1996 but has yet to announce its 1996/97 results.</p>
<p>Sable chairman John Nash said his company was considering underwriting all of the Don Group's planned rights issue and he expected the issue to be completed within six weeks.</p>
<p>Paul Nash said Don Group's food interests had been sold to different buyers with effective dates from July 1 to December 30. There were no further details given on the identity of the buyers.</p>
