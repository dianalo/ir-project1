<title>UK: FINE AIR PLANE INSURED FOR $10 MLN - MARKET.</title>
<headline>FINE AIR PLANE INSURED FOR $10 MLN - MARKET.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Fine Air DC-8-61F cargo plane which crashed yesterday was insured for $10 million, London insurance market sources told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>The jet crashed seconds after take-off from Miami International Airport and has been declared a total loss, insurers said.</p>
<p>All four crew members are presumed dead after the plane plummeted to the ground, skidded across a six-lane road and crashed into the parking lot of a shopping mall.</p>
<p>The aircraft, registration number N27UA, was built in 1968. The UK broker was C.E. Heath.</p>
<p>The flaming wreckage set fire to cars, trucks and parts of buildings, sending orange fireballs and dense clouds of black smoke into the air.</p>
<p>This brings to six the number of accidents involving large aircraft in little over a week and comes just two days after a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed on Guam with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Hull losses alone from these accidents are estimated to cost insurers close to $200 million, with no clear estimate yet on liability claims.</p>
<p>The KAL aircraft was insured for around $60 million, while a Federal Express freighter which crashed at Newark was insured for $115 million, making it the third most costly hull loss ever.</p>
<p>Three other passenger aircraft have also been damaged or destroyed in the last week, but none is expected to lead to a large insurance claim.</p>
<p>Two were total losses -- An ATR-42 which crashed at Florence airport and was insured for $14.5 million and an Air Afrique Boeing 737 insured for $3.0 million.</p>
<p>A British Aerospace ATP airliner was damaged when it landed on two wheels at Manchester airport. No loss estimate is available yet on this aircraft.</p>
