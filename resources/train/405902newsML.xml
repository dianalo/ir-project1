<p>Britain hopes to resume beef exports within months after submitting plans to the European Union for easing a worldwide ban imposed over fears of mad cow disease, a junior British minister said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically (the proposals) have to go to the (EU) veterinary committees but I would hope that we would start to see a lifting of the ban for the certified herds within a matter of months,&quot; junior agriculture minister Tony Baldry told Reuters.</p>
<p>Baldry, attending an agriculture fair in Paris, said the plan unveiled on Tuesday was a &quot;substantial step to the lifting of the beef ban&quot;.</p>
<p>British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg wrote to EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler on Tuesday to outline proposals under which cattle from herds certified to be free of mad cow disease could be exported again after an 11-month ban.</p>
<p>Hogg gave no precise predictions about when the ban might be lifted, merely saying he hoped for renewed exports &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>The ban was imposed after Britain said it had found evidence that people could contract a fatal brain disease by eating beef from infected animals.</p>
<p>Baldry said farmers in Northern Ireland were likely to be the first to benefit from any resumption of exports because a selective cull would soon be completed there.</p>
<p>Scottish farmers have accused the Conservative British government of favouring Northern Irish farmers to win support in parliament, where Ulster politicians' support could be vital in the run-up to the coming general elections.</p>
<p>Baldry said London hoped there would quickly be negotiations about export of all young cattle after its drive to eradicate mad cow disease, known to scientists as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>&quot;We have now fulfilled all our parts of the Florence agreeement so we are looking to our European colleagues to fulfil their parts and the lifting of the ban on certified herds is the first part of that process,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An EU summit in Florence in 1996 set out the steps for a gradual lifting of the ban on Britain, the country that has by far the most cases of BSE.</p>
<p>Baldry said Britain would seek agreement to export any cattle born after August 1996 in a next phase to ease the ban, but added this would be negotiable with other EU members.</p>
<p>The new scheme will be considered by an EU veterinary committee, and then by farm ministers, who have previously been reluctant to sanction British exports in the light of evidence that mad cow disease is transmissible to h EEC TRD GB DE POL FOD HEA MEAL LIV ENV SCI NEWSumans.</p>
