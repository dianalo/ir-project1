<p>Indonesian central bank governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said on Tuesday that the bank had no immediate plans to widen the rupiah/dollar band on which it bases its intervention in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Speaking at a seminar during which he was expected to announce a widening of the band, Djiwandono said: &quot;We are doing okay. We will do it when needed.&quot;</p>
<p>Rumours in overseas markets on Monday that he would announce a widening of the band during his speech had led to a brief rise in the rupiah against the dollar, but the rate eased after central bank officials said no such plan was in the offing.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the rupiah was virtually unchanged at 2,345.50/2,346.30 against the dollar at 1020 GMT after a 2,345.25/2,346.00 opening.</p>
<p>The band, which is set by the central bank daily, was fixed at 2,346/2,538 rupiah against the dollar on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Djiwandono also said monetary expansion had so far slowed down in 1996 although some economic overheating was still likely in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Monetary expansion has slowed down, but the growth of M2 (money supply) and bank loans are still relatively high and still above forecasts,&quot; he said.</p>
