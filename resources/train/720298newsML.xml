<p>Sterling will remain the darling of the forex market after Thursday's quarter point rise in UK interest rates as the allure of further hikes is likely to keep it in demand, traders said.</p>
<p>The Bank of England raised rates to 6.75 percent from 6.50 percent, disappointing the hopes of many forex dealers for a chunky half point increase.</p>
<p>The pound dropped over a pfennig on the news close to 2.95 marks but dealers soon picked it up at the lows.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has happened that could take the shine off sterling,&quot; said David Bloom, currency strategist at HSBC James Capel. &quot;It will continue to be driven higher by favourable interest rate differentials.&quot;  </p>
<p>The pound is a haven for investors searching for higher interest rate returns in a low-yield global environment. The UK has the highest base lending rates of any major world economy. While UK rates are expected to rise, interest rates are expected to remain low in continental Europe as a result of sluggish economic activity and tight fiscal policies, while Britain enjoys robust economic growth.</p>
<p>The consumer sector is experiencing near-boom conditions as consumers spend billions of pounds in windfall profits from building socities converting into banks.</p>
<p>At 1300 GMT the pound was at 2.9640/50 marks, unchanged from its pre-rate news levels but down a touch from 2.9671/81 in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The weakness of dollar/mark weighed on the pound, dealers said. The dollar was knocked down by about a pfennig after Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said it was important that the mark remained strong going into the start of European monetary union.</p>
<p>Against the dollar, sterling stood at $1.6889/95 from $1.6900 before the rate annoucement and compared to $1.6844/49 at the previous European close.</p>
<p>Economist expected the BOE to continue raising rates in small steps, with the next hike likely to come after the next meeting of the BOE's monetary policy committee on August 6/7. Today's rise was the third in three months.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate rise is unlikely to be deemed enough to slow consumer spending to the pace needed to remove any inflation threat,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America.</p>
<p>&quot;Many traders will look for another 25 basis points move at either the August and/or the September meetings,&quot; he said. &quot;As a result, the positive backdrop to the pound should be sustained.&quot;</p>
