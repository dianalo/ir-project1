<p>U.S. spot MTBE prices remained largely steady on Friday amid tight supply on prompt barrels and following news a U.S. House panel killed the ethanol subsidy.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the House tax writing panel narrowly defeated a measure to preserve the 54 cents a gallon tax incentive on ethanol, which competes with MTBE as an octane enhancer.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just a step,&quot; said a MTBE trader based in Houston. &quot;We won't react until any cut in the subsidy is signed by Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, continued buying in the U.S. Gulf Coast to load a 260,000 barrel cargo for New York Harbor kept prices at 80.00/80.25 cents a gallon. The boat began loading late last week and caused a nearly two cent jump in the market.</p>
<p>Another player was heard loading a large number of barrels in the Gulf for the West Coast after finding cheap freight rates aboard a mix-used vessel, traders said.</p>
<p>The demand has tightened the supply of prompt barrels, and the outlook for prices appears to remain bullish in the near term.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts predict a drop in imports this month into the harbor partly due to turnaround at Arco's MTBE facility in Rotterdam. This Saturday, Venezuela's 12,500 barrel-per-day plant in Jose, Venezuela, will also go down for turnaround to change a catalyst. It will be out until June 28.</p>
<p>The facility, which is a joint venture with Echo Fuels, exported much of its product to the West Coast, traders said.</p>
<p>Harbor spot MTBE was pegged a half cent stronger, with offers at 83.25 cents.</p>
