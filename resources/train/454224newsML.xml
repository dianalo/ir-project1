<title>DENMARK: Danish shares to continue fall if bonds stay weak.</title>
<headline>Danish shares to continue fall if bonds stay weak.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices closed lower on Wednesday, hit by falling bonds, with dealers seeing the KFX index drop another half point on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The share market cannot take much more decline on the bond market. This has an adverse affect on purchase orders. More pressure from weaker bonds means further share falls tomorrow,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index lost 0.45 point to close at 158.03, while the KFX March future finished off the day unchanged at 157.50 with 970 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>The market decline was further reinforced by a 24 crown drop in Den Danske Bank, which paid out its 1996 dividend, before closing at 575.</p>
<p>Other KFX paper in focus were ISS, Tele Danmark and Danisco. ISS ended seven crowns up at 189, while Tele Danmark, hit by worries about stiffer competition because of telecoms deregulation, shed two crowns to finish at 341 -- both in the wake of 1996 results.</p>
<p>Danisco performed strongly in a cautious market, putting on six crowns to 404. Overall turnover for the day was 1.8 billion crowns.</p>
