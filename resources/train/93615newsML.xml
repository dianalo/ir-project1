<headline>Jamaican gets retrial in U.S. writer's murder case.</headline>

<text>
<p>Jamaica's appeals court has ordered a retrial of the man convicted for the October 1994 murder of Chicago screenwriter Terrence Runte, court officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Elvis Martin, 37, was convicted and sentenced to hang for the murder earlier this year, but an appeals court on Wednesday found the trial judge had given inadequate directions to the jury and Martin did not get a fair trial.</p>
<p>Runte, a screenwriter who had worked on several major Hollywood features including &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot;, was on vacation in Jamaica when he disappeared.</p>
<p>His burned-out rental car was found not far from where he was staying in Port Antonio on Jamaica's north coast.</p>
<p>The accused led police to an area on the coast known as Shark Rock where divers recovered some of Runte's clothes.</p>
<p>The body was never found and authorities believe it was eaten by sharks. The prosecution charged that Martin had beaten Runte to death, tied his body to a large stone and thrown it into the sea.</p>
