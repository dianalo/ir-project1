<p>The East Timor capital Dili was quiet on Friday after a brief disturbance the previous day following the stabbing of a man by a trader from another island, local residents said.</p>
<p>&quot;The town is just normal. All the kids have gone to school,&quot; a local journalist in Dili reached by phone told Reuters.</p>
<p>Police on Thursday said a man was stabbed in a local market and taken to hospital. Another man had been detained.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said students in Dili took to the streets on rumours that a student had been stabbed. University authorities calmed the situation and persuaded them to disperse.</p>
<p>Reports of the disturbance caused the Indonesian rupiah to fall briefly against the dollar on Thursday.</p>
<p>The journalist said there had been no noticeable build up in tension before next Tuesday's anniversary of the 1991 killing of at least 50 demonstrators by troops in Dili following the funeral of an anti-Indonesian youth activist.</p>
<p>Indonesian forces occupied the former Portuguese colony in December 1975, and Jakarta integrated it as Indonesia's 27th province the following July in a move the United Nations has refused to recognise.</p>
