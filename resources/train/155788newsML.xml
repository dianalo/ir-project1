<title>USA: Dorrance III sells Campbell Soup shares.</title>
<headline>Dorrance III sells Campbell Soup shares.</headline>
<dateline>CAMDEN, N.J. 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Campbell Soup Co said Thursday that the major block of the company's stock that traded in the open market earlier today had been owned by John Dorrance III, a retired director.  </p>
<p>Dorrance, the grandson of Campbell founder Dr. John Dorrance, sold nine million shares of the company's stock at $80 per share, the company said.</p>
<p>In recent months, John Dorrance III has been selling huge blocks of equity in the food giant, as detailed in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.</p>
<p>Sources said earlier Thursday that J.P. Morgan handled today's transaction and probably lined up the buyer or buyers.</p>
<p>Campbell shares were trading at 80-1/8, down 2-7/8, Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Today's block trade, equal to 3.8 percent of Campbell's 247 million shares outstanding, was not part of a 13.5 million share buyback at $80 per share announced by the company on October 18, a Campbell spokesman said.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange said the transaction was the seventh largest block trade in dollar terms ever on the exchange.</p>
<p>Dorrance could not be reached for comment. The Campbell spokesman said the company does not have any contact with him since he resigned from the board of directors last year. The Campbell spokesman said two of Dorrance's siblings and two cousins remain on the company's 15-member board of directors.</p>
