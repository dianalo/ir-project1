<p>Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno has quit the ring on medical advice, Britain's Sun newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>An eye specialist told the 35-year-old Bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The Briton, who lost his World Boxing Council (WBC) title to Mike Tyson in March, said: &quot;I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still hasn't really sunk in.</p>
<p>&quot;I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I'm glad I had a good innings.&quot;  </p>
<p>Bruno, for years one of Britain's most popular sportsmen, had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye.</p>
<p>Professor David McLeod, who examined Bruno, told the Sun: &quot;There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again. He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995.  </p>
<p>He was only the third Briton ever to hold a world heavyweight title.</p>
<p>But Bruno lost the title on his first defence when he fought American Tyson in Las Vegas. Bruno suffered a cut eye in the opening round and the referee stopped the fight in the third as the Briton crumbled under a flurry of punches.</p>
