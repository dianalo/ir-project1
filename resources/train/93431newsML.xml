<p>An adviser to the Russian finance ministry said on Thursday a government decision to freeze assets of gas giant Gazprom  should set an example to other major companies to pay their taxes on time.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe such an example will be used not so much to bring in funds but as a clear demonstration of political will,&quot; said Maxim Kulikov, a member of the ministry's economic expert group.</p>
<p>A finance ministry spokesman declined to comment on Gazprom, which said on Thursday that regional tax authorities had frozen 76.3 billion roubles worth of assets at its Urengoigazprom unit. The subsidiary produced almost half of Gazprom's 1995 output.</p>
<p>Kulikov said the tax authorities were a regional division of the federal government and were acting on federal initiative.</p>
<p>The company, where Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov both once worked, has been viewed as a state within a state and many analysts have questioned whether the authorities have the will to take the company on.</p>
<p>Gazprom, which says it owes 15.3 trillion roubles in taxes, says its consumers owe it three times that and attempts to collect the tax could bankrupt the vast firm.</p>
<p>Kulikov said he expected the federal government to compromise with the natural gas monopoly and that some taxes would be paid and others restructured. &quot;But that is not an official position,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the government had decided months ago to pursue the 20 largest debtor firms who represent some 80 percent of unpaid federal taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;The government could easily be bankrupted if it does not make sufficient efforts to improve tax collection,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As of September 1, the Russian government was owed 66 trillion roubles in unpaid taxes, of which 15.1 trillion had been rescheduled and was not illegally overdue, he said.</p>
<p>Lower than expected tax revenues was one reason for a delay in handing over one tranche of a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia during the summer.</p>
<p>An IMF official said in Washington on Wednesday that the IMF team has recommended payment of the latest tranche of the loan.</p>
<p>Rodionov, speaking to Nezavisimaya Gazeta in an interview, said the issue of tax arrears needed to be examined carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Tax issues are not simply and cannot be decided quickly. Everything must be well thought out,&quot; he said.</p>
