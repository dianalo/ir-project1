<p>The front month March fuel oil swaps were down at midday on Tuesday on fears that there is no longer any physical buying support for prompt cargoes, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market slipped after no buyers came out to support the market yesterday in the face of a low offer,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>March fuel oil swaps were quoted at $96.00/$97.50.00 per tonne, down from Monday's $98.25/$99.25. But April swaps were down slightly in reaction to the sharp overnight crude losses at $94.50/$96.00 against Friday's $95.50/$96.50 per tonne.</p>
<p>On Monday, a trader offered 20,000 tonnes of fuel oil loading April 5-9 at $99.00 per tonne free-on-board Singapore, down $2.00 per tonne from Friday's offered level.</p>
<p>Physical fuel oil traded on Thursday at $101.50 per tonne but the trader who bought the cargo was no longer in the market to buy.</p>
<p>Overnight, April Brent crude lost a hefty 58 cents to close at $19.28 per barrel while March gas oil was down $2.00 per tonne to end at $167.00.</p>
<p>Despite these large falls, gas oil swaps were down only slightly in quiet trade.</p>
<p>March gas oil were last quoted at $25.90/$26.15 per barrel, down from Monday's $26.10/$26.30, brokers said. April was quoted at $24.50/$24.70, down 10 cents from Monday.</p>
<p>Brokers said April swaps traded earlier in the day at $24.50 per barrel.</p>
<p>April swaps traded earlier in the day at $24.80 per barrel.</p>
<p>Traders said the market's strength was primarily due to expectations of continued buying from a local trader who had since the start of last week bought prompt several cargoes.</p>
<p>The local trader had on Monday bought two cargoes totalling 370,000-barrels at $27.00 and $27.30 per barrel fob Singapore. This is on top of the 890,000-barrels the trader bought last week in five cargoes.</p>
