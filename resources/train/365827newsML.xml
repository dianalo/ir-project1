<p>Canadian 88 Energy Corp, facing a hearing over alleged trading improprieties and a falling stock price, said it was dropping its C$652-million takeover bid for Morrison Petroleums Ltd.</p>
<p>The move follows Canadian 88's announcement on Friday that it was extending the cash-and-stock offer until February 19, to accommodate a hearing before the Ontario and Alberta securities commissions that was scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>The original offer was to have expired on Friday.  </p>
<p>Calgary-based Canadian 88 said it decided to kill the bid after receiving new information regarding Morrison's natural gas exploration plays and amid uncertainty surrounding the regulators' halting of share trading in connection with the offer.</p>
<p>It said that &quot;a review of the current status of Morrison and consultation with Canadian 88's shareholders has led to the conclusion that the interests of Canadian 88 are better served in maximizing value for Canadian 88 shareholders by withdrawing the offer.&quot;  </p>
<p>Canadian 88 had offered C$10 cash, to a maximum cash portion of C$140 million, or 1.5 of its shares for each Morrison share.</p>
<p>But as uncertainty over Canadian 88's bid intensified over the past week, it share price fell, lowering the value of the exchange. Canadian 88 stock closed Friday at C$5.40.</p>
<p>The securities bodies on Monday were expected to probe whether Canadian 88's relationship with West Central Capital Corp, a private firm associated with the suitor, should have been more fully disclosed in the offering circular.</p>
<p>The OSC and ASC were also expected to determine whether all Morrison shareholders should be given the opportunity to sell their shares to Canadian 88 on at least the same cash terms as those afforded West Central, which made C$44 million of trades in the days leading up to the bid announcement.</p>
<p>Trading in shares related to the bid was halted late Thursday.</p>
<p>Canadian 88 chief executive Greg Noval said as late as Friday that he believed he had provided enough new information to the commissions to alleviate their concerns.</p>
