<headline>Brazil seen leaving July interest rates steady.</headline>

<p>Brazilian economic policy-makers are expected late Wednesday to leave July interest rates unchanged amid uncertainties surrounding trade and economic activity, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty over external liquidity going forward, the trade situation and economic activity has caused the market to anticipate a cautious move. Rates are expected to remain the same,&quot; said Marcelo Carvalho, chief economist at J.P. Morgan in Brazil.</p>
<p>Economists noted that steady U.S. interest rates would also encourage Brazil to leave rates alone for July.  </p>
<p>The government's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) was expected to leave the Central Bank's basic monthly interest rate, known as the TBC, unchanged at 1.58 percent for the third consecutive month.</p>
<p>The Copom, comprised of Central Bank, Finance and Planning Ministry officials, was also seen leaving the TBAN rate unchanged at 1.78 percent. The TBAN is the rate charged to banks that draw more than their limit from Central Bank credit lines.</p>
<p>Generally, the TBC and TBAN respectively function as floor and ceiling for market interest rates.</p>
<p>The Copom meets in the second half of each month to set rates for the upcoming month.</p>
<p>The committee interrupted a long period of monthly rate reductions in May, fearing they would fall to low to continue attracting foreign capital.</p>
<p>Rates have also been kept steady to slow consumption of imported consumer goods, which have contributed to record trade deficits in Brazil over the last two years.</p>
