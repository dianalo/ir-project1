<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures nudged higher in sleepy Thursday morning trade with light business centred on switch activity.</p>
<p>Traders said trade buying and an absence of origin sales again helped values.</p>
<p>Although prices continued to creep higher in the past few days, volume had been very subdued amid lack of fresh market-moving news.</p>
<p>Midday volume reached a meagre 2,089 lots.</p>
<p>September came in $29 higher and reached the day's high of $1,887 before ending the midday at $1,875, still a $25 gain.</p>
<p>July/Sept switches were quoted at $17-$20.</p>
<p>Trading enthusiasm has also been dampened by the absence of volatility in New York, forecasts of mild weather in Brazil and concerns over new LIFFE coffee quality-grading scheme.</p>
<p>LIFFE told members on Wednesday that it would review the grading criteria for coffee following complaints from the trade that the terms had resulted in large amounts of coffee being graded as non-tenderable.</p>
<p>But pending the outcome of the review, the controversial ruling on the specific defect count for mouldy beans would continue to be enforced.</p>
<p>So far this month, some 72 percent of the beans put up for grading had failed the rigorous test.</p>
<p>Weather in Brazil's coffee areas is also forecast to be mild.</p>
<p>Private U.S. forecaster Weather Services Corp said no major cold was seen in the next few days, with low temperatures of 53-66 degrees expected. -- Jalil Hamid, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
