<p>European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann, saying Europe is lagging behind the United States and Japan, urged the EU on Tuesday to move from words to concrete action to fight record unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;Please get away from the rhetoric,&quot; he told a conference on the competitiveness of the European Union, adding that &quot;nice words&quot; were hiding the real problem.</p>
<p>Commission figures show that the 15-nation EU has managed to create only 10 million new jobs since the 1960s, half the figure for Japan and less than one fifth of what the United States has achieved.</p>
<p>Europe is lagging behind its two main trading rivals in terms of labour productivity and the proportion of the working-age population which is employed.</p>
<p>As a result, the EU level of gross domestic product per capita is nearly one third below that of the United States and one sixth below the Japanese level.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the EU falling behind concerns the way markets for products, labour and services work.</p>
<p>&quot;We have restrictions on labour markets that interact with those on products and capital markets and prevent the development of new goods and services,&quot; Bangemann said.</p>
<p>He described German legislation on opening hours for shops -- which were recently liberalised -- as &quot;one of these horrible German inventions; to restrict somebody who wants to work&quot;.</p>
<p>A controversial Commission report published last week said rigid labour laws may contribute to the bloc's high unemployment rate, but that they are not the only culprit.</p>
<p>The report became controversial when press reports accused the Commission of planning to suppress graphs showing a link between unemployment and strict social legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission has denied the reports, saying it decided not to include them only because they showed a weak correlation.</p>
<p>But Bangemann appeared to give a different picture, saying: &quot;We know that all these socially engaged people don't believe us so we wanted to convince them with a picture. It was so convincing that they didn't like the picture.&quot;</p>
<p>Bangemann said Europe had a high cost industry but that he was not advocating lowering the part of wages which workers take home. &quot;Because that would be foolish, politically and economically,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Instead, he singled out costly key industry inputs, especially services such as telecommunications, saying monopolies were to blame.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore we are destroying monopolies...the one who is defending monopolies is in fact defending unemployment,&quot; Bangemann said.</p>
<p>As a tool to boost the competitiveness of the EU, Bangemann spoke strongly in favour of so-called benchmarking, a method of comparing companies and economic systems so that companies and countries can strive to be as good as the best.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to benchmark the Portuguese economic system with the Danish economic system or the way the Finns and the Swedes have handled postal services with the wishes and desires of Italy and France,&quot; Bangemann said.</p>
