<p>Singapore set up a research institute on Friday to meet growing world demand for multimedia technology and to retain its edge in high-tech manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Data Storage Institute (DSI) will take over the work of the Magnetics Technology Centre (MTC) started in 1992, but will have an enlarged charter to support the data storage industries and have a bigger investment budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of the MTC into a research centre reflects the emphasis the government is placing on R&amp;D and innovation,&quot; Yeo Cheow Tong, Minister for Trade and Industry, said at the opening of the institute.</p>
<p>&quot;Such capabilities are vital if Singapore is to remain competitive in the years ahead in the face of intensifying regional and global competition,&quot; Yeo said.</p>
<p>DSI will develop expertise and capabilities not only in manufacturing hard disk drives but in optical storage devices.</p>
<p>Industry experts note that data storage has now moved from magnetic technology, such as hard disk drives to optical data storage like those of CD-ROMS in personal computers.</p>
<p>The institute will conduct research and development and draw investment through programmes with multi-national companies in hard disk drive, opto-electronic and disk media industries.</p>
<p>Singapore is already the leading manufacturer of hard disk drives, producing nearly half the world's supply.</p>
<p>Last year, the hard disk drive industry contributed about 15 percent to Singapore's total manufacturing output.</p>
<p>DSI director Low Teck Seng said the institute had been granted Singapore $55 million for three years from 1996.</p>
<p>This compares with an expenditure of slightly more than $13 million by the MTC since it was started in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to excel...because in this day and age nobody wants to partner a second-rate institution,&quot; Low said, noting that it was necessary to partner MNC's on the right level.</p>
<p>Singapore hosts all the major disk drive players such as IBM, Seagate, Maxtor and Western Digital.</p>
<p>Industry officials and experts noted signs of improvement in the global electronics sector should also aid Singapore's economic growth this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the electronic sector to remain fairly volatile for the next few months, but I think the medium-term outlook based on feedback from the industry is very encouraging,&quot; Yeo said, adding a turnaround should be firmly anchored by mid-year.</p>
<p>Singapore's economic growth picked up in the fourth quarter of 1996 due to a more robust electronics sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Our present forecast is 5 to 7 percent this year,&quot; Yeo said. Singapore enjoyed 6.5 percent overall growth in 1996.</p>
