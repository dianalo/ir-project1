<p>It was 7.20 p.m. on a Saturday when American aid worker Nitin Madhav heard gunfire outside his home in Rwanda's rural northwest , the signal for 20 minutes of horror in which three Spanish colleagues were killed and he was left badly wounded.</p>
<p>&quot;I was on the phone to a friend when we heard the fire,&quot; he said. &quot;I got off the phone. We turned off the lights in the house and went into one of the bedrooms in the back,&quot; he said by telephone from his hospital bed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he was flown for recuperation.</p>
<p>In the first of a series of attacks against aid workers in Rwanda on January 19, Madhav, a Spanish doctor and two nurses were gunned down in their house in Ruhengeri, near the border with Zaire.</p>
<p>Dr Manuel Madrazo, 42, and nurses Maria Flors Sirera, 33, and Luis Valtuena, 30, all working for the Spanish aid agency Medicos del Mundo (Doctors of the World ), were killed. Madhav survived with gunshot wounds to his right leg, which had to be amputated.</p>
<p>Madhav, 28, had little time to understand the bloody history of Rwanda and its ethnic violence. He had arrived in the tiny central African country only four days before the attack. All he knows now is that he does not have a right leg.</p>
<p>&quot;I came in on Tuesday and was shot on Saturday. It seemed my purpose in life was to come to Rwanda, get shot at and go home.&quot;</p>
<p>When Madhav was in Tajikistan several years ago, his mother told him not to get shot at. &quot;When I was going to Rwanda, she told me not to drink the water. She got it wrong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Four Rwandan gunmen broke into the house shortly after firing was heard, wearing military boots and dressed in khaki uniforms. They spoke French, the language spoken in the former Belgian colony in addition to the local Kinyarwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the men, their leader, asked to see our passports. We gave our passports. Then we all sat down in the living room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was petrified. The others were scared but calm. As we were sitting, three of the men started running around the house, ransacking it. One went into my bedroom, he took my raincoat, my short-wave radio and some cash.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then they all left. Before they left, the leader said 'thank you'.&quot;</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Madhav said they heard shouts outside the gate, which was manned by two Rwandan security guards.</p>
<p>&quot;Then the leader came back in again. He sprayed the room with gunfire. I ducked. I dived under a table. It all happened so quickly. From where I was hiding, I saw him running after Luis and Flors. They were running in the corridor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the man pull the trigger. Just a couple of rounds, to the head. From five metres (yards). I saw Maria fall.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon, one of the guards came in. &quot;He was apologising. He went in to look at the others. All of them were dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Madhav asked the guard to take him to hospital, but the guard did not know how to drive, and the American had to show him what to do. When they arrived at the hospital there was no doctor.</p>
<p>At the hospital, a group of Rwandan villagers just gathered around him and stared. &quot;I asked for help. Nobody came.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally a doctor was found, and  Madhav's leg was amputated there and then, in the small, ill-equipped and filthy Ruhengeri hospital.</p>
<p>Madhav does not know who the gunmen were. He cannot tell a Hutu from a Tutsi, the two tribes of Rwanda which have been warring each other for centuries.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people said they were the Interahamwe (Hutu rebels). I don't know who they were. They looked slightly scared,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know why it happened. I don't have an answer. &quot;</p>
