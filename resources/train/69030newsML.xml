<p>Newly-crowned county champions Leicestershire wrapped up the season with a comprehensive win over Middlesex by an innings and 74 runs on Sunday and also earned themselves an extra cash bonus.</p>
<p>Guaranteed 65,000 pounds ($101,000) for winning the title, Leicestershire added a further 10,000 pounds ($15,600) to their prize fund by completing their 10th victory of the season.</p>
<p>Middlesex, resuming on 194 for five and still 128 runs adrift, collapsed to 248 all out, with seamer David Millns claiming four for 21 from the 5.3 overs he bowled on Sunday.</p>
<p>Millns finished with four for 48 while England pace bowler Alan Mullally claimed three for 40 to round off the easy victory.</p>
<p>But there was one cloud on Leicestershire's horizon with the possibility they could be without the services of West Indian Phil Simmons next season.</p>
<p>The Trinidadian all-rounder has played a major part in the county's success, having hit more than 1,000 first-class runs and taken 55 championship wickets, but he may not be available for much of next season under a plan by West Indies to put their leading players under contract.</p>
<p>If Simmons is one of the West Indies under contract he would be unavailable for matches at the start and end of the English county season.</p>
<p>&quot;We could handle the odd week if he is going to be arriving late for next season but if he's not coming until the end of June I don't know what will happen,&quot; said coach Jack Birkenshaw.</p>
<p>Surrey, who had begun the final round of matches with an outside chance of taking the title, had to settle for third place after losing to Worcestershire by 124.</p>
<p>Captain Alec Stewart had already abandoned the title hopes on Saturday when he forfeited Surrey's first innings in the hope of gaining a win which would ensure second place.</p>
<p>But chasing an improbable 424 for victory, Surrey were all out for 299 despite a masterful 129 not out by opener Darren Bicknell who batted through the innings.</p>
<p>Surrey's defeat meant second spot in the table went to Derbyshire who completed an eight-wicket win over Durham on Saturday.</p>
