<p>Canadian bonds closed weaker on Tuesday, underperforming their U.S. counterparts amid a weaker Canadian dollar, the pressure of new supply and profit-taking on recent spread narrowing, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Canadian market just has to consolidate, with Canadian yields venturing where no Canadian yields have ventured before,&quot; said Will Sutherland, vice-president of fixed income with Altamira Investment Services Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.35 to C$106.25 to yield 7.455 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 6/32 to yield 6.80 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the benchmark bonds widened to 66 basis points from 63 basis points at Monday's close.</p>
<p>The spreads between Canadian and U.S. benchmark bonds at the 10- and 30-year portions of the yield curve fell to 11-year lows yesterday. The new lows were reached amid a Canadian dollar rally and strong European buying of Canadian dollar-denominated securities.</p>
<p>Analysts said the recent rally in the currency and bonds are the result of investor recognition of Canada's positive bond market fundamentals such as low inflation and improving government finances.  </p>
<p>Analysts said today's underperformance was partly the result of investors taking profits on the recent spread narrowing.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a little bit of profit-taking. We've had a very aggressive run over the last little while, and the currency has eased off,&quot; said Mark Chandler, senior economist with Goldman Sachs Canada.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar closed slightly weaker on Tuesday amid a U.S. currency which was softer from yesterday's close.</p>
<p>In new issue news, Hydro-Quebec this morning set a C$350 million 7.0 percent bond due February 15, 2007.  </p>
<p>The issue was priced at C$98.118 with a yield of 7.260 percent for a spread of 47 basis points above the Government of Canada 7.0 percent bond due December, 2006.</p>
<p>In other prices, the 7.0 percent of 2006 fell C$0.24 to C$101.31 to yield 6.817 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 5/32 to yield 6.55 percent.</p>
<p>The spread between the two benchmark bonds widened to 27 basis points from 25 basis points.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 3.48 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.14 percent.</p>
