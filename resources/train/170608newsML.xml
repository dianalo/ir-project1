<p>Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor said in an interview published on Wednesday that his image as an ineffectual minister was untrue and being purposely spread.</p>
<p>&quot;The change in my image is not accidental,&quot; he said in an interview appearing in the daily newspaper Ha'aretz. &quot;There seem to be people who have an interest in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Since taking office in June, Meridor has been perceived as failing to act on pressing issues. The key components of a capital market reform package he strongly endorsed has failed to win cabinet approval and in the debate over the 1997 budget that began in parliament last week he was reportedly left out of important behind-the-scene negotiations.</p>
<p>Meridor refused to discuss who might be responsible and insisted there was no basis to it. &quot;I am not subordinate to anyone for now and I don't accept any of the talk about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that his position had been undermined by the opposition he faces in cutting the 1997 budget package, which must be approved by the end of December.</p>
<p>&quot;I had no doubt that this was going to be a difficult job with unpopular decisons to make,&quot; Merdior said. &quot;It's a lot easier to be a finance minister who is expanding the budget.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There were mistakes and in order to succeed we must correct them,&quot; he said, referring to the widening budget deficits of the last two years under the previous Labour government.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this will happen, because if we don't reduce government expenditures now, and reduce the deficit after a period when it was irresponsibly left to grow, we will suffer a worsening crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>The Treasury's 1997 budget calls for 4.9 billion shekels in cuts on spending of 190.8 billion. It has met oppositon from members of parliament who say the cuts will fall hardest on lower-income groups.</p>
