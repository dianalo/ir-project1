<p>China has launched a survey to find measures to reduce property prices to bring housing within the reach of middle and low income families, officials and state media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Housing prices should be slashed by at least 20-30 percent,&quot; the China Securities newspaper quoted Construction Minister Hou Jie as saying.</p>
<p>The government wants to resolve the problem of vacant homes by reducing housing prices to encourage ordinary peole to buy, a ministry official told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The Construction Ministry had launched a research survey to find a level for actual housing prices, excluding land rent, taxes and fees for public facilities, another ministry official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, all kinds of fees and taxes account for 50 percent of the actual cost of housing,&quot; the newspaper quoted Hou as saying.</p>
<p>In addition, China had launched a construction programme last year to provide low-profit commercial housing, with low land rents and taxes, to middle and low-income families, the officials said.</p>
<p>China has invested 25 billion yuan ($3.0 billion) in the project and investment would reach 37.5 billion yuan by the end of this year, China Securities said.</p>
<p>By the end of June, a total of 9.0 million square metres (96.8 million sq feet) of such housing had been built and the total construction scale was expected to reach 43.59 million square metres (469.2 million sq feet) by the end of 1996, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China has announced plans to build 1.2 billion square metres (12.9 billion square ft) of urban housing by 2000.</p>
