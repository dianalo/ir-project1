<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sounded &quot;decidedly more hawkish&quot; on the U.S. interest rate outlook than in recent comments about monetary policy, former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot rule out a situation in which a preemptive policy tightening may become appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation becomes evident,&quot; Greenspan said in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on the economy and monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Blinder, who now holds the chair of economics at Princeton University, told Reuters Greenspan's assessment &quot;relative to his previous Humphrey-Hawkins (July 1996) testimony, for example, this one had a decidedly more hawkish tone.&quot;</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of healthy growth and low unemployment, financial markets began to expect a rate hike in mid-1996. The Fed has not hiked rates since though it set a tightening bias.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan clearly is putting everyone on notice that the Fed is not asleep at the wheel,&quot; Blinder added, noting a &quot;pointed reference to the possibility of another preemptive policy tightening.&quot;  </p>
<p>Blinder, however, declined to predict when the Fed would raise the 5.25-percent federal funds rate in what would be the first such move in just over two years.</p>
<p>In further comments about Greenspan's testimony, Blinder turned to:</p>
<p>-- REAL FUNDS RATE</p>
<p>Greenspan also signaled that any interest rate hike by the Fed at this stage would be more limited in scope than the aggressive February 1994-February 1995 tightening cycle in which the Fed doubled the federal funds rate.  </p>
<p>&quot;To be sure, 1997 is not 1994,&quot; Greenspan said, describing the real funds rate as &quot;significantly higher&quot; today.</p>
<p>Blinder declined to predict the timing of an eventual hike and agreed with Greenspan the inflation-adjusted real funds rate is much higher than in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;It's worth noting that Greenspan pointed out the difference between 1994 and 1997, especially the fact we are now starting from a much higher real federal funds rate,&quot; Blinder added. &quot;In my judgment, the real fed funds rate is slightly on the restrictive side whereas in early 1994, it was about zero.&quot;  </p>
<p>INFLATION</p>
<p>Greenspan also stated policymakers see &quot;the distribution of risks skewed to the upside&quot; and will remain &quot;vigilant for signs of potential inflationary imbalances.&quot;</p>
<p>But Blinder pointed out Greenspan repeatedly made the point the economy is not currently facing any of the potential sources of imbalance that may have threatened the U.S. economy if the Fed had not acted preemptively in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;We ought to remember the testimony both began and ended with references to an economy free of 'imbalances,' his favorite term, and which the economy is,&quot; Blinder said.  </p>
<p>Blinder said Greenspan gave &quot;a very favorable picture of current inflation. It is, of course, true that core inflation is creeping down, not up.&quot;</p>
<p>The year-over-year core Consumer Price Index fell to 2.5 percent, a three-decade low in January, and this despite tight labor markets that historically have pushed wages higher.</p>
<p>WAGE PRESSURES</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan is wondering out aloud how long this can go on,&quot; Blinder said, in reference to the Fed chairman's remarks on the absence of marked wage pressures -- which may be tied to job insecurity and technology improvements.</p>
