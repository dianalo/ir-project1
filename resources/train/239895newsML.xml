<title>JAPAN: Foreign securities firms appeal to MOF on tax plan.</title>
<headline>Foreign securities firms appeal to MOF on tax plan.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Four major foreign securities firms have submitted a petition to Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) appealing against planned rule changes on foreign bond investment.</p>
<p>The ministry should conduct a thorough study before finalising the plan, they said in the statement, a copy of which was acquired by Reuters.</p>
<p>The firms, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and SBC Warburg, suggested that MOF work with them to come up with a plan that could be widely accepted by market participants.  </p>
<p>It said the MOF's plan could damage the competitiveness of Eurobonds issued by Japanese firms.</p>
<p>The MOF plan, disclosed earlier this week, is aimed at closing a tax loophole in foreign bond investment.</p>
<p>It would require identification of the final holder of Eurobonds issued by Japanese borrowers to show they are foreigners and therefore exempt from tax.</p>
<p>A MOF study showed that about 80 percent of Euroyen bonds are held by Japanese investors.</p>
<p>The statement said the MOF's aim to require identification of final investors would not be easy to achieve. &quot;We wish the Japanese eurobond market to develop and we hope that the ministry will examine our opinions,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>MOF has already submitted the plan to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel.</p>
<p>Industry sources said they expect the panel's decision during the week of December 16.</p>
