<title>FRANCE: High EU wheat price seen threatening exports.</title>
<headline>High EU wheat price seen threatening exports.</headline>

<p>Strong internal wheat prices may steer the European Commission towards halting the current wheat export campaign earlier than expected, a farm official at the European Commission said.</p>
<p>No date had been considered for the time being. But the official said it was &quot;abnormal&quot; that domestic common wheat prices should be so high at the end of the season, while new crop prices had risen to &quot;demented&quot; levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The more the internal prices go up quickly, the more likely we are to stop quickly,&quot; the official said, speaking by telephone from Brussels.  </p>
<p>The EU's campaign for giving out subsidised export licences traditionally stops around the end of April or during May, leaving the U.S. in the driving seat with early sales of its new crop. Licences issued now can be used up to end-June.</p>
<p>The official said that if the EU did decide to stop giving out licences sooner than the normal date, &quot;the firmness of (domestic) prices will be the first cause&quot;.</p>
<p>Export demand has put upward pressure on old-crop French wheat prices recently while early signs of drought are pushing up the new crop, grain traders said.  </p>
<p>Prompt French soft wheat for Rouen delivery had risen five francs per tonne since the start of the month to a bidding level of 905 to 910 francs excluding carrying charges, traders said.</p>
<p>Buyers of August new crop were bidding 910 francs at Rouen, they said. Local prices are traded on a &quot;July basis,&quot; bringing them back to a &quot;July basis&quot; valid at the start of each season and excluding carrying charges. Carry for the second half of April is worth 65.44 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;Towards the end of the campaign it is abnormal to have prices so strong on our internal market,&quot; the EU official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The price is much too firm for the end of the season and much too firm for the beginning of the (next) season.&quot;</p>
<p>The official added, &quot;New-crop prices...are exactly the same as the current prices for April. Something is not right.&quot;</p>
<p>Even while export licences were available, the Commission would take care to hand them out without pushing up domestic prices further, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are stuck. The Commission cannot award too much quantity or too much refund. We only have one solution. We will not be very generous with restitutions.&quot;</p>
<p>The official recalled that while the EU was a major seller of wheat, exports were not the most basic goal of grain policy.</p>
<p>&quot;The priority is our internal market and with such prices you can imagine that we can't perform miracles as far as (export) quantities are concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>The official said that none of the EU's 15 member states disagreed with this analysis.</p>
<p>Observers have said France, while not voting against grain export decisions, abstained recently along with other big grain states at the weekly Brussels auction were exports are decided.</p>
<p>The head of French cereals office ONIC, Alain Moulinier, said last month that exports would depend on supply and internal prices, but that member states would remind the Commission to keep the market functioning normally when necessary.</p>
