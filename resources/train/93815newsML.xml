<p>The senior trade adviser to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is going to Europe next week to meet with senior European Union agricultural officials on grain subsidies and other key agricultural issues.</p>
<p>Glickman's trade adviser Paul Drazek said Thursday that he will meet with officials in Brussels &quot;to talk about a whole range of issues, including subsidies.&quot;</p>
<p>Drazek will then go to Geneva where he will observe the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement panel on the issue of Europe's controversial ban on U.S. meat treated with growth hormones.</p>
<p>Drazek said he wanted to find out what the EU's current strategy is in subsidising some recent sales of grain, and repeat Washington's position that the United States was monitoring the situation closely and stands ready to use subsidies too if it is deemed necessary to maintain markets.</p>
<p>Drazek also said he will discuss the current situation in Europe regarding gene-altered soybeans and corn.</p>
<p>The EU earlier this year approved genetically modified U.S. soybeans, but consumer groups have voiced concern about the product and have threatened a boycott of products made with U.S. soy unless the gene-altered soybean is labelled.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said the new product is completely safe, and that labelling is unnecessary, and would be impossible.</p>
<p>Genetically engineered corn is currently under review by an EU committee, and is awaiting an official decision on whether the product will be approved. Glickman said the United States was closely watching the developments.</p>
<p>The issue of grain subsidies has flared up between the United States and the European Union in recent weeks when the EU restarted wheat subsidies in September after nearly a year of not using the enhancements.</p>
<p>Glickman reacted forcefully to the European action, and said the administration would fight to keep markets open for U.S. farmers, even if that meant resorting to subsidies and reviving the Export Enhancement Programme, the U.S. agricultural subsidy programme.</p>
<p>Drazek noted that although EU farm commissioner Franz Fischler commented earlier in the week that subsidies were not desirable, the EU subsidised another 300,000 metric tons of wheat shipments Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that they continue to do it is a concern,&quot; Drazek said. &quot;Any time they subsidise in the world, we pay attention.&quot;</p>
