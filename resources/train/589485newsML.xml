<p>Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said on Friday the European Union stood a good chance of agreeing a new basic treaty at an Amsterdam summit next month.</p>
<p>&quot;The chances of achieving an agreement look relatively good,&quot; Lipponen told a news conference ahead of an extraordinary EU summit to be held at Noordwijk in the Netherlands on May 23, where European leaders are expected to discuss the June 16-17 Amsterdam summit.</p>
<p>Lipponen said the Netherlands, currently holding the rotating presidency of the EU, had on Friday circulated a paper containing &quot;95 percent and maybe more&quot; of what is likely to be the content of a treaty to be signed at the meeting.</p>
<p>He said there were still some tough unresolved issues, including institutional matters and voting procedures, and the question of the future size of the European Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;The big countries, which have wanted a big overhaul, will have to face the fact that that would be impossible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>For Finland, a key issue has been repeated assertions that it will not give up its &quot;own&quot; commissioner in any overhaul of EU organisations: &quot;Finland's position remains the same,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lipponen warned against raising any last-minute issues which may derail the tough process of agreement: &quot;It wouldn't pay for anyone to try to to force through something that would not get wide approval,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes no sense to seek a new future for the Union at the expense of small countries,&quot; Lipponen said.</p>
