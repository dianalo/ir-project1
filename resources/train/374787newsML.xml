<p>South Africa's NBS Holdings said on Thursday Norwich Holdings Ltd had placed a 25 percent stake held by NBS in the firm with various institutions for 625 million rand cash.  </p>
<p>&quot;Norwich and NBS announce that, in terms of a call option previously granted to Norwich, Norwich has exercised its right to place the 25 percent shareholding that NBS held in Norwich,&quot; NBS said in a statement.</p>
<p>It did not name the institutions with whom the stake was placed, but speculation was rife on Thursday that South African financial services firm The Board of Executors Ltd was set to buy a stake in Norwich from NBS.</p>
<p>NBS said the realised value of 625 million rand represented a surplus over book value to NBS of 537 million rand. </p>
<p>NBS said the proceeds of this placement would be used to pursue attractive investment opportunities which were under negotiation at present.  </p>
<p>The statement said shareholders in both Norwich and NBS were referred to previous cautionary announcements and advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the firms' shares until a further announcement was made. </p>
<p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange was on Thursday rife with rumours about the impending Norwich sale fuelled by a huge volume of over 75 million shares in that company trading, most in a single corporate finance deal.</p>
<p>Total Norwich shares traded on the day were worth around 661 million rand, dealers said. The stocks leapt 7.3 percent to 940 cents -- a new record high. </p>
<p>Analysts earlier on Thursday downplayed speculation that BOE may have set its sights on taking a sizable stake in Norwich to secure a foothold in the insurance industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see why they would want to buy into Norwich...the (insurance) industry is in a material phase where you are not seeing real growth on the recurring premium side, although the single premium side is showing a bit of growth,&quot; said Dave Southey, an analyst at stockbroker Edey Rogers.</p>
<p>Business Report newspaper on Thursday said that BOE has long wanted an insurance arm to its portfolio and had been a contender for Protea Assurance's life business which was sold last year to Commercial Union of South Africa Ltd for 250 million rand.</p>
