<title>USA: Stone Container raises pulp prices.</title>

<p>Stone Container Corp, a paper maker, said it raised prices for market pulp effective July 1, following an increase in May.</p>
<p>&quot;Market conditions have improved for all of our company's product lines,&quot; Roger Stone, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;Industry demand for containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a majority of our revenues, continues to be healthy, and we believe that the former inventory overhang has been significantly reduced, and probably eliminated.&quot;</p>
<p>Stone Container said Abitibi-Consolidated Inc, of which it owns 25.2 percent, has raised newsprint prices and has also announced a further price increase for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that our industry has dealt successfully with the overcapacity which has plagued us for the past two years, and a reasonable balance between supply and demand has been reached,&quot; Stone said. &quot;With very little capacity growth expected in the near-term, we believe we are in the beginning stage of a long-awaited recovery.&quot;</p>
