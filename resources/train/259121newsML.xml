<p>Five Swedish neo-Nazis were jailed by a court on Monday for inciting racial hatred when they took part in a ceremony to commemorate the death of Adolf Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess.</p>
<p>The five, sentenced to two months' imprisonment each, were arrested in August at the ceremony in Trollhattan, in southern Sweden, which ended in clashes between neo-Nazis and anti-racist groups.</p>
<p>Two others arrested at the same time were given suspended sentences because they were under 18.</p>
<p>All of them were members of the right-wing National Socialist Front.</p>
<p>The leader of the group made a speech praising Hess from a makeshift stage at the ceremony which was attended by hundreds of neo-Nazis from all over Sweden, Denmark, Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>Hess, who died in Berlin's Spandau prison in 1987 aged 93, has become a hero of the neo-Nazi movement across Europe. The anniversary of his death been made a rallying point for the radical right in Germany and other countries.</p>
<p>The Trollhattan demonstration was eventually broken up by about 600 police, some on horseback, after fighting broke out between the neo-Nazis and anti-racists who had also travelled from several countries.</p>
