<p>In a diplomatic offensive clearly aimed against NATO's expansion plans, Russia on Monday raised the possibility of a merger with neighbouring Belarus -- and the idea quickly received a warm reception in Minsk.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter to his Belarussian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, saying that both states should consider the idea of a referendum over unification &quot;in one form or another.&quot;</p>
<p>Kremlin press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing that Yeltsin's letter had raised the possibility of Russia and Belarus having a single government with single budget and currency taxation laws and united fuel and energy systems.</p>
<p>Lukashenko quickly welcomed the suggestion.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very glad the Russian president has reacted in this way,&quot; the Belarus president told reporters in the capital Minsk. &quot;If Boris Niklolayevich is ready, you know my position -- I have long been ready.&quot;</p>
<p>A top Kremlin official, speaking last month on condition of anonymity, told reporters the Russian leadership was trying to decide how to respond to Lukashenko's plan to hold a referendum in March on a possible union.</p>
<p>The official admitted that the economic cost of a merger with Belarus, where market reforms have barely started, would be huge for Moscow but added that immediate political and long-term economic advantages were also obvious.</p>
<p>Russia says NATO's enlargement to take in former Soviet bloc countries would threaten its security and create new divisions in Europe. The dispute appears to have been a decisive factor in Moscow's move on Monday to discuss a possible merger openly.</p>
<p>&quot;The worsening of relations with the West is pushing Yeltsin into Lukashenko's embrace,&quot; Nikolai Svanidze, anchorman of the Zerkalo analytical television programme, said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Sergei Shakhrai, deputy head of the Kremlin administration, as saying on Monday that unification could be the best response to NATO's plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>He said such a union would meet Russia's strategic and economic interests and boost Moscow's international authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Shakhrai considers that the most effective answer to NATO's expansion eastwards would be real unification between Russia and Belarus,&quot; Interfax said. &quot;He considers that 1997 gives unique possibilities for a Russian-Belarussian merger,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear if the Kremlin is seriously planning a union or is just proposing it as a means to pressure NATO.</p>
<p>Russia's rhetoric against NATO's plan has been increasingly bitter. The last meeting a week ago that Yeltsin chaired in the Kremlin before being admitted to hospital with pneumonia -- was on Moscow's policy on NATO.</p>
<p>Svanidze painted a possible doomsday scenario for Russia where extreme nationalism could develop in the face of what it considers to be the threat of NATO expansion.</p>
<p>The economy would be refocused on military needs and a strongman would emerge to rule Russia, Svanidze said.</p>
<p>The two Slav states signed an accord last April on closer economic and political ties and formed a loose community.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying in his letter that the community had become a reality and further, serious steps should follow to bring the two former Soviet republics closer.</p>
<p>The interest of the ambitious Lukashenko in such a merger is obvious. It may help him avoid current difficulties and open a way for him to a much wider political arena.</p>
<p>Lukashenko has supressed the opposition and the liberal mass media in Belarus, where the economy is in tatters, market reforms have made no progress and aid from the West has halted.</p>
<p>Highly popular in Belarus, Lukashenko ignored parliamentary resistance and won a referendum last year which granted him huge power and extended his term in office. Opponents accuse him of dictatorial ambitions which he dismisses.</p>
<p>Lukashenko has made no secret of his desire to be as close to Russia as possible. He said in a Sunday television programme he enjoyed playing the role of &quot;a junior brother&quot; to Yeltsin.</p>
<p>But he may have an eye on a future election for presidency of a possible new superstate. Svanidze said any serious growth of nationalism may make Lukashenko &quot;a real candidate for presidency in a united Slav state&quot;.</p>
