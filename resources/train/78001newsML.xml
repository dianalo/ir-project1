<title>CANADA: Toronto stocks end down on golds, profit-taking.</title>
<headline>Toronto stocks end down on golds, profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks ended weaker on Thursday after a brisk session in which investors grabbed profits from a high-flying bank sector.</p>
<p>Precious metal stocks were also depressed by sharply lower gold futures which sank to fresh three-year lows.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Index fell 17.95 points to close at 5304.62, but the key index still hit a new intraday high of 5326.88 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold stocks were down and we also had some ominous selling in the banks,&quot; said Rolie Bradley, an institutional salesman for Maison Placements Canada Inc.</p>
<p>Trading was heavy with nearly 110 million shares exchanging hands for a value of C$1.57 billion (US$1.1 billion).</p>
<p>Gains in eight of 14 sub-groups could not offset sharp losses in precious metals and financial services.</p>
<p>The gold group surrendered 250 points as COMEX gold futures sank on IMF plans to sell some of its gold reserve to help fund Third World debt relief.</p>
<p>Profit takers took aim at Canadian bank stocks which have soared to new heights in recent weeks. Overall, declining stocks outnumbered advances 523 to 456 with 262 issues flat.</p>

<p>* Among active bank stocks, Royal Bank of Canada lost 0.55 to close at 39.15 on 2.7 million shares. Bank of Nova Scotia fell 0.50 to 38.80 on 2.4 million shares.</p>
<p>* Provigo Inc. eased 0.15 to 6.25 on 3.3 million shares. The Quebec-based food retailer announced an aggressive expansion of its company-owned stores on Wednesday.</p>
