<p>Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila will meet South African President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town on Wednesday evening for talks on the troubled central African state, government sources said.</p>
<p>Kabila would meet Mandela at his Cape Town residence, Genadendal, to explore ways to bring peace to Zaire, one senior source said.</p>
<p>Mandela was trying to arrange a direct meeting in South Africa between Kabila and ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>No definite arrangement had been made for a face-to-face meeting between the two rivals, but he predicted it could take place by the weekend.</p>
<p>Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad, who was instrumental in arranging an earlier round of talks in South Africa between the Zairean rivals, was expected to attend Wednesday night's talks.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Kabila left Zaire's Lubumbashi airport for South Africa earlier in the day, but there was no word on the movements of the Zairean president.</p>
<p>Sources said the U.N. special representative on Zaire, Mohamed Sahnoun, had arrived with a delegation in Cape Town on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The sources declined any further comment on talks, saying it would be for the rebels and the Zairean government to make any statements.</p>
<p>Kabila departed at 11.40 a.m. (0940 GMT) on a South African Air Force jet bound for Cape Town after a two-day visit to Zaire's second largest city to mark his rebels' capture of the mineral-rich Shaba province.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at the airport, he again asserted that nothing would halt his drive to unseat Mobutu.</p>
<p>&quot;There will no ceasefire until Mobutu relinquishes power,&quot; the rebel leader said.</p>
<p>South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo on Tuesday predicted dramatic progress within days in ending the civil war in Zaire.</p>
<p>The rebels now control more than half of Africa's third largest country, and Kabila says he is targeting the capital Kinshasa in a bid to drive the ailing Mobutu from power.</p>
