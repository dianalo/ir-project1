<p>Israel's Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Tuesday it was surprised by local media reports that California-based Orbit Semiconductor Inc had cancelled plans to build a plant in Eilat.</p>
<p>David Baruch, director of the ministry's Investment Centre, said he had received no announcement of the cancellation but had read of it in local newspapers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We gave them a chance to continue the dialogue regarding the investment even after it appeared it was not a worthwhile project from Israel's point of view. But in the meantime they (apparently) have decided to pull the project,&quot; Baruch said.</p>
<p>Israeli dailies reported on Tuesday that Orbit, a wholly owned subsidiary of the DII Group Inc, was cancelling plans to invest $230 million in a proposed semiconductor plant in Israel's southern port of Eilat.</p>
<p>The media said Orbit blamed bureaucratic red tape for the decision. Orbit officials were not available to comment.</p>
<p>Baruch dismissed the charge of excessive redtape.</p>
<p>Orbit approached the Investment Centre in January 1996, seeking the centre's approved enterprise designation which would have made it eligible to obtain a 30 percent government grant.</p>
<p>Last month Vishay Intertechnology cancelled plans for a $50 million plant in the development town of Ofakim following what it called bureaucratic delays in getting a government subsidy.</p>
