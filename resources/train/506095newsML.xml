<p>Venezuelans will soon begin to reap the benefits of improved economic growth has the improvements of the the past year begin to reach them, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people still haven't begun to climb the slope, but they're not going to start sliding down it either,&quot; Petkoff said in an interview on Union Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;People have put their first foot on the hill...over the course of the year they'll begin to climb.&quot;  </p>
<p>Petkoff was speaking on the eve of the first anniversary of President Rafael Caldera's speech on April 15 last year when he launched a tough package of IMF-sponsored reforms, called Venezuelan Agenda.</p>
<p>The reforms -- backed by a fortunate spike in international oil prices -- have led to falling inflation, rising international reserves, renewed international confidence and improved growth prospects, with the economy set to grow 3.3 percent this year after shrinking 1.6 percent in 1996. But the measures also caused rising unemployment and a series strikes that rocked Venezuela earlier this year.  </p>
<p>&quot;This year will see significant wage increases and, shortly, a new higher minimum wage. People will soon be feeling better in their pocketbooks,&quot; Petkoff said.</p>
<p>As part of a ground-breaking reform of the crumbling social security system now under congressional discussion, all Venezuelan workers will soon receive advances on accumulated severance payments.</p>
<p>The payments, called &quot;prestaciones&quot;, or literally &quot;borrowings&quot;, work as a sort of pension scheme under which workers receive a lump sum when they leave a job. The amount depends on the number of years worked.</p>
<p>Petkoff added that, despite the fall in March inflation to 1.6 percent -- the lowest in five years, inflation was still too high.</p>
<p>&quot;...it has to come down further, although if you compare it with 12.6 percent in May last year, it's pretty good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Central Bank officials have said that pending salary increases will add some five percentage points to year-end inflation, officially targeted at 35 percent.</p>
