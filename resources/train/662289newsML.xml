<p>Japanese right-wing activists staged a brief landing on an island in the East China Sea at the centre of a regional territorial dispute, a coast guard official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Three people landed on Wednesday on one of the rocky uninhabited islands administered by Japan but claimed by China and Taiwan, an official said.</p>
<p>The activists belong to a right-wing group that erected a makeshift lighthouse on the island last July, sparking furious reactions from China and Taiwan and anti-Japan street protests in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The official said the activists inspected the lighthouse and took video footage, returning to their boat after a two-hour stay.</p>
<p>The landing, on one of the islands known in Japan as the Senkakus, was made despite a nearby patrol boat's call to desist.</p>
<p>It threatened to fan the flames of the decades-old dispute that the Japanese government is keen to play down to avoid straining ties with China.</p>
<p>Embarrassed Japanese leaders said a May 6 landing by a conservative national legislator who planted Japan's wartime emblem -- the Rising Sun flag -- on one of the islands was an &quot;illegal act&quot; that was bad for Tokyo's foreign relations.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is hoping the islands dispute will not endanger a proposed exchange of visits with his Chinese counterpart Li Peng later this year to mark the 25th anniversary of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Japan administers the collection of rocky outcrops located midway between Taiwan and Okinawa and says they have been Japanese territory since 1895, while Beijing says it has owned the islets, which it calls the Diaoyu Islands, since ancient times.</p>
<p>Taiwan also lay claims to the Senkaku islands, which it refers to as the Tiaoyutai.</p>
<p>Activists from Taiwan and Hong Kong sailed to theislands last month to challenge Japan's claim but were kept away by Japanese patrol ships.</p>
