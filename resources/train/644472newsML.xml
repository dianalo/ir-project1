<headline>Australian Stocks to Watch Today - June 6.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Some Australian stocks to watch this morning:</p>
<p>* Foster's Brewing Group Ltd A$2.60 (-0.03)</p>
<p>* Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd A$18.83 (-0.14)</p>
<p>Foster's and BHP announced late on Thursday, after trade in Foster's shares was halted, that Foster's would buyback 13 percent of its shares from Asahi at A$2.49 a share and BHP would place 616 million shares with institutional and retail investors at A$2.49 a share. The 616 million shares were crossed through the market on Friday morning. S&amp;P and Moody's have however put Foster's credit ratings on review for possible downgrade because the buy-back was largely debt-funded.</p>
<p>* Westpac Banking Corp A$7.20 (+0.25)</p>
<p>* Bank of Melbourne Ltd A$8.95 (-0.39)</p>
<p>Market speculation that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would not approve Westpac's A$1.435 billion friendly takeover bid for Bank of Melbourne appeared to race around the market on Thursday.</p>
<p>* Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd A$18.83 (-0.14)</p>
<p>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd plans to quit its A$185 million investment in the Hunter Valley as part of what could be the company's total exit from the thermal coal market, The Australian Financial Review reported on Friday.</p>
<p>* WMC Ltd A$8.12 (-0.07)</p>
<p>WMC Ltd said on Thursday it reached agreement with Vadessa Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wattle Gully Gold Mines NL, to sell to it all of the issued share capital of Hill 50 Gold Mine NL and some related mining tenements. The purchase price of the shares and tenements is A$15.005 million plus an adjustment for the net current assets of Hill 50 as at July 1, 1997, the effective date of the transaction, WMC said.</p>
<p>* James Hardie Industries Ltd A$4.05 (-0.15)</p>
<p>James Hardie Industries Ltd posted weaker annual profits on Wednesday, but forecast its expanding U.S. fibre cement and gypsum units would drive a profit surge in 1997/98. But MD Keith Barton's comments at the briefing about continuing weakness in the Australian and New Zealand building materials markets prompted some analysts to downgrade their forecasts for the 1997/98 year.</p>
