<title>UK: BAA squeezed higher ahead of review.</title>

<text>
<p>Shares in British airports operator BAA Plc were squeezed higher on Friday ahead of the results of the five-year review of its airline user charges at its three London airports, traders said.</p>
<p>At 0924 GMT, the shares were up 9p to 513-1/2p on volume of almost 2.1 million, putting them among the most actively traded shares in London.</p>
<p>BAA's regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said it expects to give its final ruling before the end of the month.  </p>
<p>The CAA announced in July that it was proposing that prices be pegged at three percentage points below inflation for five years, but it routinely reserved its final decision pending further consultation with interested parties.</p>
<p>The current five-year pricing formula, which governs landing and passenger handling charges at London Heathrow, Gatwick and the much smaller Stansted airport, runs out next April.</p>
<p>BAA immediately said it had been seeking price changes in line with inflation and that would be seeking a better deal before the CAA's final decision. But analysts said there was relief that the CAA proposals were not more demanding.  </p>
<p>The CAA has proposed that charges at London Heathrow and Gatwick be changed by the official Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation minus three percentage points a year for five years, and by RPI+1 at Stansted.</p>
<p>The CAA said in making the proposals it was accepting the main recommendations made in a weighty report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) following a six-month investigation it undertook for the CAA under the review process.</p>
<p>BAA welcomed the fact that the MMC report was generally complimentary but was not so keen on the proposed price changes.  </p>
<p>BAA chief executive Sir John Egan said in July that the CAA's proposed price formula could be workable but warned that BAA may have to cut capital spending if it could not find further operating efficiencies.</p>
<p>&quot;We would hope over the next three months...that we can examine the task ahead of us...and emerge with some kind of regulatory bargain,&quot; Egan had said.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said they expect the CAA to make the final ruling next week, on October 24. No one at the CAA or BAA was immediately available to comment.  </p>
<p>Egan warned that the CAA formula could pose difficulties for its new construction programme which includes a proposed giant fifth terminal at Heathrow and other capital spending, totalling 4.4 billion stg over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The current five-year pricing formula, which runs out next April, imposed annual price changes ranging from RPI-8 in the first two years, RPI-4 in 1994/95 and RPI-1 in 1995/96 and 1996/97.</p>
<p>But this was a compromise reached five years ago, after the CAA had originally proposed a formula of RPI-8 for all five years and the MMC had recommended RPI-4.  </p>
<p>This time the CAA also proposes that BAA be allowed to increase the regulated charges by 15 percent over two years to compensate for loss of retail revenues if, and when, the European Union abolishes duty-free sales for international travellers within the Union.</p>
<p>Egan said this would not fully compensate for loss of revenue, leaving it with a shortfall of 10 to 20 million stg a year to find from elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Company officials have said BAA's duty and tax-free sales to passengers on intra-EU routes brings in about 90 to 100 million stg a year but the CAA had estimated the shortfall would be 55 million stg after mitigating its losses.</p>
<p>BAA's pre-tax profits last year rose 14.2 percent to 418 million stg on turnover up 8.1 percent at 1.253 billion stg.</p>
<p>Retailing revenue was up 10.5 percent at 556 million stg, making airport shopping BAA's biggest single earner.</p>
<p>Regulated charges at the three London airports accounted for 28 percent of group revenues.</p>
