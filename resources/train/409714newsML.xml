<p>Payne Stewart, playing only his second tournament since undergoing December elbow surgery, fired a six-under par 65 Thursday to earn a share of the first-round lead with Scott Hoch at the Nissan Open golf tournament.</p>
<p>Stewart birdied the last two holes at the Riviera Country Club to conclude a back nine of four-under par 32, while Hoch birdied four of his final six holes to meet Stewart atop the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Hoch and Stewart stood one stroke ahead of Briton Nick Faldo and Paul Goydos, who each shot five-under 66s.</p>
<p>Mark O'Meara, seeking to win his third consecutive tournament, opened with a four-under 67 and was tied with Tom Watson, Fred Funk, Frank Lickliter and Tom Purtzer.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods returned to the U.S. Tour after playing tournaments in Thailand and Australia and shot a one-under 70.</p>
<p>&quot;I just missed three or four six-footers on the front,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;My caddie told me I was moving my head on putts, so I held it still and started making some.&quot;</p>
<p>Hoch, resuming his season after a four-week hiatus, fired a six-under par 29 for his back nine -- the front nine at Riviera. He toured holes 10 through 18 at even par.</p>
<p>&quot;It's surprising after four weeks off,&quot; Hoch said. &quot;It took me awhile to get going this morning. But I hit a lot of good shots today.&quot;</p>
<p>Faldo, who also began on the back nine, jump-started his round with an eagle-3 at the par-5 11th hole.</p>
<p>&quot;I played solid,&quot; said Faldo of his bogey-free round, &quot;as good as I've played in a long time.</p>
<p>&quot;It was nice. I've been working hard, working on my swing, working on everything. I've had some great sessions with (golf guru) David Leadbetter.&quot;</p>
