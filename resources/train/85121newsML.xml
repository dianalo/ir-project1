<p>Official data confirmed on Monday that Japan's economy is still improving, but the numbers failed to quell concerns that the recovery may be grinding to a halt.</p>
<p>The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) announced that industrial output for August fell 1.9 percent from the previous month, in line with economists' predictions, which ranged from a fall of 1.4 percent to 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>MITI forecast that manufacturers' output, which forms the core of overall production, would show a month-on-month rise of 0.1 percent in September and a 3.2 percent increase in October.</p>
<p>&quot;The data shows the industrial output was on a gradual upward trend,&quot; said a MITI official at a news briefing announcing the output data, a key barometer of economic health.</p>
<p>Japan's economy has been recovering slowly since the start of this year, emerging from four years of negligible growth.</p>
<p>But recent data has shown the recovery is not as strong as expected, and fears have increased in business circles that it may be faltering.</p>
<p>A survey of 100 firms conducted in mid-September by the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun showed that the number who view the economy as being at a standstill had risen to 43 from 14 in February, when the previous poll was conducted.</p>
<p>&quot;With the October output forecast at a plus 3.2 percent, we do not feel that the economic recovery has peaked out,&quot; said the MITI official.</p>
<p>Japan's economy was a point of discussion at a weekend bilateral meeting in Washington between Finance Minister Wataru Kubo and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.</p>
<p>A Japanese official said Kubo told Rubin he would keep a close watch over Japan's economy and work for a recovery based on domestic demand.</p>
<p>MITI forecast industrial output in the July-September period would show growth of 1.5 percent from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Figures also released on Monday showed Japan's housing starts for August jumped 14.3 percent from a year earlier, helped by record low interest rates and falling real estate prices. Construction orders in August rose 8.6 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Many analysts said the recovery had not stopped, but they did not expect the pace of the moderate improvement to accelerate at least until the end of the current fiscal year next March.</p>
<p>Some fear that a planned increase in the consumption tax to five percent from three percent next April 1 will dampen private consumption, further delaying a stronger recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the economy recovers, there is going to be a very slow pace of recovery at least until the end of fiscal 1996,&quot; Yuichi Matsushita, a strategist at Nikko Research Center, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the weak output data, I do not see any chance of the economy going into another slump. Capital investment by companies is still modestly strong and this will offset an expected slowdown in public works spending towards the year-end,&quot; said Yozo Nishimura, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.</p>
