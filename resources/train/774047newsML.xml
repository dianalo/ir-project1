<p>The U.S. T-bond rally has reached a critical  stage and decisive moves either side of the 116-23 level will dictate  whether the bull run will falter or continue powering ahead, technical  analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is bullish as long as 116-23 isn't broken,&quot; said Jerome  Bertrand, analyst at Credit Lyonnais in Paris. &quot;If it holds, we could  go to 117-01, but if we break below it, we will become bearish and  go to 116-14.&quot;</p>
<p>By 0905 GMT, September T-bonds were unchanged at 116-24 with the market  reluctant to make a definite move ahead of key July payrolls data  due 1230 GMT. According to a Reuter poll, economists expect the data  to come in at 193,000 after the 217,000 increase in June.</p>
<p>Bertrand said 116-23 was a moving average on hourly charts and 117-01  was the top of a Bollinger band. He said 116-14 was the bottom of  the same band.</p>
<p>Bollinger bands are lines drawn at standard deviations around the  price action, to give support and resistance.</p>
<p>Bertrand said above 117-01, there was little in the path of the bull  run until 117-30. &quot;In that case, it would be very bullish, but I don't  think that will happen anytime soon -- perhaps in a week or two,&quot;  he said.</p>
<p>Donna Liu, technical analyst at DKB International in London, agreed  T-bonds were at a crucial stage.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole picture is looking critical,&quot; she said. &quot;The selling pressure  has not been particularly strong, but these levels could still prove  to be the top.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, we could still go to 120-00, 122-00, which is  around 6.0 percent on the cash long bond.&quot;</p>
<p>Liu said if the market could stay above 116-17 for a few weeks, it  would be very positive for the longer term.</p>
<p>Gerry Celaya, senior technical analyst at American Express Bank here,  put moderate first resistance at 116-28/31 followed by a minor trendline  at 117-07 and a firmer barrier at 117-22.</p>
<p>To the downside, he put initial minor support at 116-16/20 followed  by a moderate prop at 116-00.</p>
<p>By 0925 GMT, December Eurodollars were up 0.005 at 94.220.</p>
