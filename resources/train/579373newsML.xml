<p>New Jersey's Board of Public Utilities, in a key step toward opening the state's retail power market to competition, said Tuesday it has approved GPU Energy's proposed pilot retail sales program.</p>
<p>GPU's plan will allow 12,000 residents in Monroe Township to choose their electricity supplier for one year, starting July 1, and can be renewed until New Jersey phases in retail competition for 10 percent of its residents in October, 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This is New Jersey's first experiment in electric retail competition. We're encouraged by the strong interest in a competitive electric market and we're looking forward to learning from the experience,&quot; Board president Herbert Tate said in a statement issued after the board's meeting earlier today in Newark.</p>
<p>The pilot program was hammered out between Monroe Township and GPU, the area's existing power provider.</p>
<p>In accordance with deregulatory guidelines, the GPU-Monroe pilot will give customers the option of remaining a GPU Energy customer, selecting another power provider individually, or joining a consumer group to secure lower group power rates.</p>
<p>GPU, based in Parsippany, N.J., will continue to maintain transmission and distibution lines serving the area and provide meter reading and central billing services for those in the program.</p>
<p>New Jersey, joining several other states, is introducing competition in its electric utility sector in the hopes it will lower electricity bills for all customers by five to 10 percent.</p>
<p>According to the state's Energy Master Plan, agreed by the Board of Public Utilities April 30, free choice of power provider will be phased in and available to all customers by July, 2000.</p>
