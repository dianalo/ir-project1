<p>General Motors Corp. disclosed Wednesday that Chairman Jack Smith took home $6,164,226 in salary, bonus, stock options and other compensation last year, up 9.3 percent from $5,637,931 a year ago.</p>
<p>Excluding exercised stock options, Smith's 1996 salary, bonus and other compensation of $5,781,875 was about even with the $5,738,976 Ford Motor Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Trotman received last year.</p>
<p>Robert Eaton, chairman and chief executive of Chrysler Corp. the smallest of the Big Three automakers, received $8,185,933 in total compensation in 1996, not including exercised options.</p>
<p>Smith's pay, contained in GM's proxy statement released Wednesday, showed the automaker increased his base salary 16.7 percent to $1,750,000, but trimmed his bonus 8.6 percent to $1,600,000.</p>
<p>As with other top-paid executives, the company's board based Smith's bonus on the company's operating performance last year, thus not penalizing him for work stoppages that cost GM $1.2 billion in lost profits in 1996.</p>
<p>Earlier, GM restructured the bonus formula for its salaried employees so their incentive pay was also not hurt by strikes that slashed GM union profit-sharing checks by more than half to about $300 each.</p>
<p>GM gave Smith $2,310,000 in long-term incentive payouts last year, about the same as $2,300,000 in 1995. Smith exercised options worth $382,351 in 1996; he did not exercise options in 1995.</p>
<p>In addition, Smith received options for 200,000 shares of GM common stock in 1996, up from options for 150,000 shares he received a year ago. The options allow Smith to buy shares at $52.25. GM's stock was trading in the $56.25 range Wednesday. GM said the options have a present-day value of $2.8 million.</p>
<p>With the exception of Hughes Electronics Corp. Chairman Michael Armstrong, bonuses fell for all of GM's top-paid executives.</p>
<p>Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, received salary and incentives totaling $2,945,000 and stock options for 101,300 GM shares and 31,400 GMH shares. He also exercised options worth $1,066,782 in 1996. In 1995, Pearce earned $2,850,000 in salary and incentives, and exercised options worth $433,813.</p>
