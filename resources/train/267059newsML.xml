<p>China's domestic A shares continued to plummet on Thursday with investor confidence still in tatters following the rude shock of a government crackdown on the markets on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B share index ended little changed at 64.343 points with bargain-hunting support prices, but A shares on the market fell 7.54 percent to 940.548.</p>
<p>On the Shenzhen stock market next to Hong Kong, the A share index plunged 8.7 percent to 357.85 points, while the B shares were also down sharply, losing 5.42 percent to 126.54 points.</p>
<p>&quot;A growing number of investors want to leave the A and B markets, at least for a while,&quot; a Shenzhen trader said.</p>
<p>Brokers said Shanghai A shares plunged on unstable market sentiment and reported seeing some panic selling on rumours that more negative market news could be announced at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail investors used the opportunity of a technical rebound on Wednesday to offset their positions,&quot; said one broker. &quot;Sentiment is still weak.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shanghai B share market is looking the healthiest of the China share markets in the wake of the crackdown in which the Beijing authorities said stock trading was overheated and warned of a crash if speculative trading was not stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Technical charts show the B share index is likely to consolidate between 63 and 65 points in the short term with investors targeting stocks with strong profits records,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere was the star on expectation of good results, rising $0.052 or 9.84 percent to $0.580, on volume of 1.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai Tyre &amp; Rubber followed on institutional buying, up $0.034 or 8.21 percent to $0.448, on volume of 1.2 million shares.</p>
<p>In Shenzhen, brokers said the market was hit by institutions taking profits on the B share market with investors still jittery over Beijing's crackdown.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors offset their positions whenever prices rose because they have little confidence in the market's short-term outlook after the falls earlier this week,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>Many Shanghai B shares closed at the 10 percent limit-down with Dadonghai falling HK$0.36 to HK$3.20 on volume of 5.84 million shares on institutional selling, brokers said.</p>
<p>Changan Automobile traded the most on volume of 11.86 million shares, losing HK$0.20 to HK$3.55.</p>
<p>The A market plummeted with the majority of A shares closing at the 10 percent limit-down due to heavy selling in &quot;rubbish stocks&quot; -- shares of smaller firms with poor business results over the past few years, brokers said.</p>
<p>One Shenzhen broker predicted that the A shares could have a long way further to fall given their strong gains in the past few months.</p>
<p>But several Shenzhen counters with strong earnings records were seen being supported by institutional demand, brokers said.</p>
<p>Guangdong Power's A shares rose 0.93 yuan or 5.72 percent to 13.49 yuan, with its B shares up HK$0.35 or 6.36 percent to HK$5.85 per share, making them the best performers on the city's A and B share markets on Thursday.</p>
