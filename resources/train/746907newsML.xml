<p>NWE high sulphur fuel oil barges were steady on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges traded at $86.50 a tonne fob ARA for stored material but refinery barrels were subsequently sold for $88, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were broadly steady and thin although differing qualities were heard under discussion. Lower quality material was pegged close to $84 cif NWE, while better quality pieces were assessed around three dollars above that.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cargo markets were flat to firmer, and dealers said they only saw one prompt offer of material.</p>
<p>This was available out of Germany, they said, but the offer price on Tuesday morning was not known.</p>
<p>Low sulphur straight-run fuel was slightly firmer in line with futures.</p>
<p>While six NWE-origin pieces were thought available between August 10 and 15, nothing was thought on offer ahead of that time. At least one player, an ARA refiner, was heard seeking prompt product and was bidding at around $102 on a fob basis late on Monday.</p>
