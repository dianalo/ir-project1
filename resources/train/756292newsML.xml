<title>UK: Zinc sweeps to new seven-year peaks in AM trading.</title>
<headline>Zinc sweeps to new seven-year peaks in AM trading.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fresh Chinese and fund buying swept zinc prices to the $1,600 mark in early inter-office trading as tightness in nearby dates throttled the market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point $1,700 isn't out of the question, and neither is $2,000 on cash,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Short covering and borrowing in September and October dates was driving three months prices into fresh highs since July 1990, traders said.</p>
<p>The cash to threes backwardation flared out to $50/$57, compared to $40 at the end of the kerb on Thursday and around $5 contango at the start of the week.</p>
<p>Attention was focused on reports that Chinese smelters were heavily short and locked in a battle with a long European merchant and other players.</p>
<p>The market has sustained a breathless upwards pace since the start of the year, gaining nearly $200 this month alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone's been caught short, including the funds. They're all piling in,&quot; a trader said, noting a support stock draw of 3,450 tonnes.</p>
<p>However, a bit of forward selling was countering the rise. Three month prices were last indicated at $1,588/$1,592 per tonne, compared to Thursday's afternoon kerb close of $1,571.</p>
<p>The market was very oversold with the RSI well above the 70 level which is considered overbought.</p>
<p>&quot;This market needs a good shake out before heading higher,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The other metals were generally stable to firmer.</p>
<p>Copper pushed up to around $2,330 at one point, compared to a kerb close of $2,292. Prices were last indicated off highs at $2,310/$2,315.</p>
<p>Traders said the metal was reluctant to leave the $2,225-$2,340 range which has constrained the market since July 9.</p>
<p>The cash/threes backwardation was little changed at $45/$50 as the last day of a well-signposted two weeks of tightness dropped off. Stocks were up 5,325 tonnes.</p>
<p>Aluminium was holding steady above $1,650 resistance against a background of tightness in August/September as well as market acknowledgement of steady drawdowns in LME stocks.</p>
<p>Cash to threes threatened to move into backwardation as the spread tightened to a $2/$1 contango, compared to $4/$2 on Thursday and $25 at the start of the week.</p>
<p>Nickel ticked up to at $6,810/6,825, compared to $6,775 while tin was quoted at $5,335/5,370 compared to $5,310.</p>
<p>Lead was at $642/$645 against $646, and an LME  stock rise of 650 tonnes was counteracting the bullish influence of zinc.</p>
<p>Alloy was little changed at $1,475/1,490 after finishing sharply higher on Thursday with aluminium. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
