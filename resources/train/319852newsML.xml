<p>A New Year rally in base metals stalled temporarily towards the end of last week but traders predict it may resume in coming days, citing a reawakened investment fund interest.</p>
<p>Impressive gains last week drove zinc to 23-month highs and aluminium to eight-month peaks, as well as underscoring tin and nickel which traded at their best for four months.</p>
<p>&quot;It definitely had a better feel to it - my only caution is that volumes, generally, are not large. Turnovers are on a bit of a plateau at the moment,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>All London Metal Exchange (LME) metal prices have recorded substantial gains so far in 1997 from end-1996 levels, ranging from four percent for lead to nearly 16 percent for nickel.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of selling around at the back-end (of last week), just the usual profit-taking,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Traders expect further consolidation on technical grounds in the short-term, but expect buyers to be back in soon, especially as physical business increases in momentum towards the end of the month.</p>
<p>Copper prices, which concluded at $2,248 a tonne on Friday, are seen re-testing $2,280 prior to driving above $2,300 if the current technical tightness worsens.</p>
<p>Aluminium finished last week at $1,607, and really needs to break $1,625 - a double top on the charts. The booming zinc market concluded a barnstorming week at $1,137 and now has $1,200 in its sights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts said there are longer-term implications for prices to be gathered from last week, notably the stirrings of speculative fund involvement.</p>
<p>&quot;The word on the street is don't be short commodities for 1997' and its quite clear that commodity funds have been active in these early days,&quot; Nick Moore of the Flemings Global Mining Group said.</p>
<p>So far, funds have only tipped their toes into the water, but their potential is significantly higher.</p>
<p>Equity markets are bouyant at present, with New York hitting record highs last week, but any signs of bourses faltering could result in asset re-allocation towards commodities, others said.</p>
<p>Last week also saw some banks issuing metal call warrants</p>
