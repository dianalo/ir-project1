<p>The dollar traded comfortably above 1.80 marks and 115 yen on Tuesday, and dealers and analysts said further gains were just a matter of time.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel gave the mark a brief fillip early in the session when he said Germany wanted a strong currency and that strength in the dollar and sterling was a market overreaction.</p>
<p>Waigel's words fed market fears that a surging dollar might provoke central bank intervention. But those concerns were not enough to prevent the dollar testing above the key psychological level of 1.80 marks, a 71-month high.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.8006/11 marks at 1520 GMT, off its almost six-year peak of 1.8040 but way above Monday's late European level of 1.7885/95.</p>
<p>It has risen 17 percent since the start of this year, gaining six pfennigs this month alone.</p>
<p>&quot;I think mark weakness will continue -- at the moment I don't see any reason to sell dollars or sterling,&quot; said Andy Evenden, senior trader at Bank of Boston in London.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen has been overshadowed by the vibrant rallies in dollar/mark and sterling/mark, but the dollar too put on a late spurt, jumping to 115.81/91 yen from 113.68/73 late yesterday.</p>
<p>Market watchers played down speculation of intervention, at least for the time being, but for some the prospect of central bank action was still on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised if the G7 were considering ways and means of stabilising currencies,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>The dollar had also been boosted overnight by comments by Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara.</p>
<p>He was reported to have said the G7 had no intention of using foreign exchange rates as a trade tool and that expectations of yen strength were too high.</p>
<p>The UK's FTSE 100 index set a record closing high for the second consecutive day, up 41.9 points at 4,899.3 on strong bank, pharmaceutical, and retail shares.</p>
<p>Banks were Tuesday's star performers with a strong overnight performance by HSBC shares in Hong Kong setting the tone and putting the whole sector in the limelight again.</p>
<p>The most actively traded stock, BT, ended lower on concerns about the British telecom group's announced merger with American MCI.</p>
<p>&quot;This market still wants to go higher,&quot; said the head of market-making at one leading brokerage. &quot;There is a lot of liquidity looking for a solid safe home.&quot;</p>
<p>In New York the Dow industrials opened firmer but then traded in negative territory as investors continued to buy technology stocks. The Dow was off 22 points at 7901 but Nasdaq up eight points at 1532, amid prospects for solid second quarter earnings results.</p>
<p>U.S. blue chips were seen needing the bond market's support to make gains. Bonds had at first strengthened after a 0.5 percent rise in June retail sales, viewed as non-inflationary, but later dipped.</p>
<p>Germany's blue-chip DAX index shrugged off expectations that it would take a pause, and reached a new record high in post-bourse IBIS computer dealings.</p>
<p>&quot;We are really in need of a pause, some sort of consolidation,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer. &quot;People are starting to get nervous and it is becoming hard to justify these sorts of levels and an advance at this pace.&quot;</p>
<p>The French market, closed on Monday for Bastille Day, closed higher on Tuesday supported by the dollar.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel fell 9.27 percent to 6.85 francs, after strong gains last week on a debt deal and following a strike announcement.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1600 GMT</p>
