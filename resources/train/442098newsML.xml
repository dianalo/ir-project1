<p>Oil prices rebounded to three-week highs on Friday after the speculative funds pushed prices to above $20 a barrel, even though many analysts warned there was plenty of oil around.</p>
<p>The expiry of the front-month crude futures contract in London also resuscitated an anaemic market that has tumbled 25 percent since January and led to many prognoses for further weakness as the spring thaw arrives.</p>
<p>At 1705 GMT, Brent crude oil futures for April delivery were up 26 cents at $20.15 a barrel, the strongest level for the spot contract since February 20.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the funds are fairly evident in the market and sense a potential move to the upside,&quot; said Tony Machacek, an oil broker at Credit Lyonnais Rouse.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of the trade are actually quite negative, thinking there is plenty of (supply) availability, and are generally bearish,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The managed funds, or speculators, tend to study the chart patterns of oil prices to determine whether to buy or sell, and crude's ability to end the week on a strong note would further entice their buying, Machacek said.</p>
<p>The fundamental picture was more contradictory, analysts said.</p>
<p>U.S. gasoline inventories remain at a healthy deficit to year-ago levels as the industry gears up for the spring and summer driving seasons. And production from the North Sea in April was due to come in lower than expected.</p>
<p>But some demand estimates were also registered at less-than-robust levels, meaning the market may not be able to absorb the growing production from OPEC and non-OPEC suppliers, other analysts said.</p>
<p>Highlighting that weakness, the United Nations is considering a request to cut the price of Iraq's Kirkuk Blend crude, as part of the oil-for-food plan, for European customers because of a further deterioration in cash prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect considerable oil price weakness as we enter the second stage of the price correction,&quot; after the sharp drop so far this year, analysts at Salomon Brothers said in a recent report.</p>
<p>&quot;We caution investors that while all eyes are on the supply arena, the real surprise in 1997 may be in the demand weakness,&quot; Salomon said.</p>
<p>It said demand this year may grow at the historical norm of 1.5 percent, or 1.1 million barrels per day, not enough to absorb an expected boost in world supply of 2.5 to 3.0 million bpd.</p>
<p>But Machacek said that a seasonal demand for gasoline, with U.S. stocks five million barrels under a year ago, may take the baton from the weaker heating oil market as traders say good-bye to winter.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall (gasoline) stocks are beginning to decline looking further out and that leaves gasoline stocks looking fairly tight,&quot; he said. &quot;There may be a fair amount of crude around but product demand...is one thing potentially to hold this market for the next few weeks.&quot;</p>
