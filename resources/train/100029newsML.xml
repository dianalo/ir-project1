<title>USA: U.S. exporters downplay India wheat export halt.</title>
<headline>U.S. exporters downplay India wheat export halt.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-10-07</dateline>

<p>News that India has halted licensing of wheat exports was slightly supportive to U.S. wheat futures Monday, but exporters said the impact was muted since India's exports this season were expected to be much lower than last year.</p>
<p>At 1218 EDT, CBOT December wheat futures were unchanged at $4.21 per bushel after rising as high as $4.23-1/2 in early trading on the India news.</p>
<p>Indian grain traders said on Friday that wheat exports were halted due to low government-owned stocks.  </p>
<p>Export shipments ceased on September 30 after the APEDA state agency quit issuing export licenses, the traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say it is slightly supportive to the wheat market here. That would take out another supplier of wheat,&quot; one U.S. exporter said. &quot;There are some exporters that are trying to cancel their sales of Indian wheat to see if the buyer would take another origin,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>One European trader said he heard talk that India cancelled over 100,000 tonnes of wheat exports, but said it was not confirmed and shipment dates were not known.  </p>
<p>In September, the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged 1996-97 Indian wheat exports at 300,000 tonnes, down from the August estimate of 1.0 million tonnes versus 1.6 million tonnes shipped in the 1995/96 season.</p>
<p>&quot;Logistically, it is tougher to get wheat out of India compared to the United States,&quot; the exporter said.</p>
<p>But a second U.S. exporter said Indian wheat had not been competitive in the world market for a few months.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that they did not have any sales to cancel,&quot; the exporter said. &quot;But they are just not renewing export permits because they want to try to buy interior wheat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Their crop may not be as big as they thought,&quot; the second exporter added.</p>
<p>Last month USDA pegged India's wheat crop at 66 million tonnes, unchanged from its August estimate and up from its 1995/96 output of 65.5 million tonnes.</p>
