<p>In a recent article exploring currency boards, the London-based Economist criticised Lithuania's reasons for wishing to dump the model, but officials claim the story was wide of the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it did not state very clearly our position and reasons for wanting to leave the currency board,&quot; said Jonas Niaura, deputy governor of Lithuania's central bank.</p>
<p>Under Lithuania's currency board arangement, the central bank guarantees that it will have one U.S. dollar for every four litas in circulation, freezing the exchange rate at that level.</p>
<p>The new government sparked investor fears in the wake of its victory in last October's parliamentary elections when it threatened to quickly scrap the system. It has since backed down and says that it will be a gradual process.</p>
<p>In its May 3-9 edition, the Economist argued that slow restructuring in industry, lost competitiveness and the 1995 banking crisis have made the currency board - controversial since its 1994 inception - a target of policy makers.</p>
<p>Exchange rate problems between the litas' peg currency, the dollar, and European currencies have further erroded support for the currency board, the Economist argues.</p>
<p>&quot;Given these problems, it is clear that many Lithuanians would like to wriggle out of the currency board's disciplines,&quot; the Economist writes.</p>
<p>The Economist also claims Estonia is trying to shed some of the vestiges of the currency board arrangement it entered into in 1992.</p>
<p>Lithuanian officials say the Economist misunderstood the real reason for leaving the currency board.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are leaving the currency board because our litas is pegged to the dollar and we are going to join the European Union,&quot; said Margarita Starkeviciute, head of research at the Central Depository.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the currency board) does not allow us to influence interest rates in our economy and to establish a normal central bank,&quot; Niaura said.</p>
<p>Niaura said moving away from the currency board arrangement would allow the central bank to manage liquidity in banks, define the money supply and react better in a situation of &quot;shock absorption.&quot;</p>
<p>He said what is desired is flexibility, &quot;flexibility in making decisions, in managing interest rates and the money supply.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials have tried to assure foreign and domestic investors that Lithuania's plan to eventually aboilish the currency board does not mean the litas will fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The abolition of the currency board does not mean the devaluation of the currency,&quot; said an official with the finance ministry.</p>
<p>Starkeviciute claims the business lobby is not in favour of devaluation anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that they understand that our companies are acquiring a lot of capital goods on foreign markets...so devaluation will not help them,&quot; Starkeviciute said.</p>
<p>The central bank's Niaura said Lithuanian securities markets are stable, despite worries by the Economist that the country may be leaving the currency board arrangement from a position of weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now seeing a return of foreign investors to our securities market and T-bill market,&quot; Niaura said. &quot;I don't see any confusion in our markets.&quot;</p>
