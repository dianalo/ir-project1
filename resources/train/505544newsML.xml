<p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), set up to help former communist countries become more efficient, apologised on Sunday for Soviet-style queues and overcrowding at its annual meeting. But first vice-president Ron Freeman said the overcrowding, while regrettable, was also a tribute to the amount of interest the countries of central and eastern Europe had succeeded in arousing among international investors.</p>
<p>Irate bankers spent up to five hours waiting for admission at the start of the four-day gathering on Saturday, while many were unable to attend presentations by Russia and Bulgaria on their economies on Sunday because meeting rooms were too small.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand yesterday that there were registration delays, terrible problems and delays,&quot; Freeman told a news conference, adding that this had been due to a computer crash.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very embarrassed about this. We have apologised to our guests and we're trying to make amends every way we can.&quot;</p>
<p>The EBRD, which expects around 4,000 participants for this year's meeting, on Saturday offered to refund the 200 pound ($320) registration fee for people forced to wait a long time.</p>
<p>Responding to charges that the meeting rooms were too small, Freeman said: &quot;That's one way to put it. The other way to put it, more constructively, is that enthusiasm for this region is growing.&quot;</p>
<p>Rather than blaming the organisers, he said the 26 countries in which the bank operated should be congratulated &quot;for attracting an extraordinary number of people who are so interested in hearing what's going on.&quot;</p>
<p>It was never easy to find a venue that could accomoodate so many people. &quot;I'm sorry about this. Handling large numbers of people...we're trying to get better at it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Russia's presentation, one of the highlights of the meeting, drew hundreds of delegates, journalists and guests into a meeting room too small to accommodate them.</p>
<p>&quot;It demonstrates the interest we have in Russia,&quot; EBRD Secretary General Antonio Costa, the main organiser of the annual meeting, told the gathering.</p>
<p>Although EBRD representatives scurried to bring in extra seats from other rooms, even bar stools, scores of people left as they did not have headsets to listen to the simultaneous translation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is pointless,&quot; a Swedish investment banker muttered.</p>
<p>A Ukrainian delegate, whose country had to stage its presentation twice on Saturday because many interested participants were still waiting outside the first time, said the rooms were far too small.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole set-up here, logistically, is just terrible,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Bozhkov told a room crammed to capacity that it was a pleasure to see such a full hall. &quot;Interest in Bulgaria has definitely grown,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he also grumbled that the organisers were to blame for a a late change of venue. &quot;They put Uzbekistan in a much bigger hall,&quot; he complained.</p>
