<p>Heavy rain hit western Europe's grain growing areas, triggering fears about crop quality, just as farmers in Central and Eastern Europe were counting the cost of the worst floods in living memory.</p>
<p>Widespread downpours hit southern England in the crucial final 10-12 days of the wheat crop development.</p>
<p>Farmers' biggest worry was the quality of the wheat, sector sources said on Thursday. With prices already down, their fear was their wheat would not be good enough for bread-making and instead would be sold as lower-priced wheat for animal feed.</p>
<p>Concern over quality is a striking feature of this year's harvest world-wide, according to a leading international authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall I think a problem this year will be one of quality in most of the major producing regions of the world,&quot; Bill De Maria, assistant executive director of the authoritative London-based International Grains Council said.</p>
<p>In England, the south-west has been worst hit by recent rain. &quot;Torrential rain looks set to flatten any crops still standing,&quot; the south-west National Farmers Union said.</p>
<p>Atrocious weather could slash the value of wheat and barley by rendering it fit only for animal feed rather than bread or beer making, it said.</p>
<p>In Ireland, widespread rain and localised flooding is not yet looking likely to affect the overall volume of grain produced.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it will affect the market,&quot; Seamus Funge, of the Cereals Association of Ireland, said.</p>
<p>In France, the tail-end of three days of bad weather means harvesting remains at a standstill in northern areas, but storms have mostly moved south to where wheat and barley have been cut, the Meteo France weather service said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Most of the big-yielding northern areas still to be harvested have been caught up in this week's storms, boosting farmer's fears over crop damage or quality losses.</p>
<p>Parts of Germany have been badly hit by flooding, but sunny weather since Sunday allowed harvesting to proceed fast, with farmers hopeful of completing it in the next fortnight, farm union DBV said in a harvest update.</p>
<p>The swollen River Oder on Germany's eastern border retreated on Wednesday, leaving a vast trail of mud, dead fish and waterlogged homes. Three weeks of flooding, the worst in living memory, have turned a large tract of once-fertile agricultural land in the Ziltendorf basin south of Frankfurt an der Oder into a vast mosquito-infested swamp.</p>
<p>The Brandenburg state environment ministry has formed a working group to assess the extent of damage to farms, ministry spokesman Dieter Schuette said, but would not have any results for a while.</p>
<p>Poland's grain harvest might be cut by a total of one million tonnes due to flooding and heavy rain in July, Bogdan Judzinski, of the Warsaw branch of the PZZ grain firm said.</p>
<p>Hungary has completed most of its wheat harvesting and the remainder should be finished by about August 15, an Agriculture Ministry Official said on Thursday. Persistent rains have lowered the quality of the wheat crop but producers, traders and ministry officials had varying opinions on the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>&quot;Quality has worsened, but not to the extent some people say,&quot; farm ministry official Sandor Oravecz said.</p>
<p>Romania's Agriculture Minister said on Thursday heavy rains and flooding had pushed down the 1997 forecast wheat crop to 6.9 million tonnes from earlier estimates of 7.1 million tonnes. Last year's disastrous harvest was only 3.1 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In the Czech republic, less than five percent of the total sown area has been affected by flooding, according to most recent estimates.</p>
