<headline>Dole airs controversial new ad pushing tax cuts.</headline>

<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole's campaign on Wednesday unveiled a new television ad pushing his tax-cut plan, saying Americans &quot;shouldn't have to apologize&quot; for wanting to keep their money.</p>
<p>The advertisement, which will be broadcast in 17 states, also takes aim at President Clinton's record, claiming he passed the biggest tax hike in history.</p>
<p>The spot opens with an announcer's voice criticizing the Clinton administration, saying: &quot;Stagnant wages. The largest tax increase in history. Two incomes needed to make ends meet. Americans deserve better.&quot;</p>
<p>The announcer then turns to Dole's tax plan, built around a 15 percent across-the-board cut, saying: &quot;Cut wasteful spending. Balance the budget. A tax cut of $1,600 for the typical family.&quot;</p>
<p>Dole himself appears, saying, &quot;You shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep what you earn. It's your money.&quot;</p>
<p>The Republican candidate, who lags Clinton by double-digits in opinion polls, has used that line in a series of campaign appearances in the central and western parts of the country this week.</p>
<p>Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart replied by saying that Dole's commercial &quot;shows how out of touch his campaign has become.&quot;</p>
<p>He said expert agreed that Dole's economic plan was wrong &quot;because it will balloon the deficit, raise mortgage rates, and require even more extreme cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment than Newt Ginrich and Bob Dole fought for -- and President Clinton vetoed -- last year.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Dole visited a day-care center in Des Moines, Iowa, and was presented with a three-year-old's drawing of the number 15 -- which he held up as proof that even children are thinking about his tax cut plan.</p>
<p>Dole flies later in the day to Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio before returning to Washington Thursday.</p>
