<headline>Thomas &amp; Betts to acquire Augat.</headline>
<dateline>MEMPHIS, Tenn. 1996-10-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thomas &amp; Betts Corp and Augat Inc said they signed a definitive agreement for Thomas &amp; Betts to acquire Augat in an exchange of stock.</p>
<p>At Thomas &amp; Betts's current stock price, the value of the transaction would approximate $550 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed before year end.</p>
<p>Under terms, Thomas &amp; Betts will exchange 0.68 share of its common stock for each Augat share, subject to exchange rate adjustments should the price of Thomas &amp; Betts' stock fall below a certain minimum or exceed a certain maximum level.  </p>
<p>The transaction is structured to be a tax-free exchange for Augat shareholders, and is intended to be accounted for under the &quot;pooling-of-interests&quot; method.</p>
<p>The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which is subject to approval by the shareholders of each company.</p>
<p>With respect to earnings results, Thomas &amp; Betts said the company expects the acquisition of Augat to be neutral to slightly accretive to 1997 earnings and moderately accretive thereafter.  </p>
<p>The agreement specifies a maximum and minimum range for Thomas &amp; Betts stock price beyond which the terms would be modified. The exchange ratio will be adjusted if the average closing price of Thomas &amp; Betts' shares during the 20 trading days ending three days before Augat's special shareholders' meeting to approve the merger falls outside the range of $37.50 to $41.50.</p>
<p>Below an average price of $37.50, the exchange ratio would be increased to maintain a minimum of $25.50 worth of Thomas &amp; Betts' stock received in exchange for each Augat share.  </p>
<p>Above a $41.50 average price, the exchange ratio would be reduced to limit the monetary value of Thomas &amp; Betts' stock received to $28.22 for each Augat share. If the average price is below $32.00 per share, Thomas &amp; Betts has the right to cancel the transaction.</p>
<p>Thomas &amp; Betts has sales of more than $1.4 billion and produces connectors and components for worldwide electrical and electronics markets. Augat makes connector products, with broad applications in the communications, computer, automotive and industrial markets. Thomas &amp; Betts is in Memphis, Tenn., and Augat in Mansfield, Mass.</p>
