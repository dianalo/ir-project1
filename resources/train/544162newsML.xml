<headline>PaineWebber says settles tax case with NYC.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>PaineWebber Inc said Monday it settled a tax dispute with New York City that city officials have said might have snarled its bid to keep underwriting New York City debt.</p>
<p>&quot;PaineWebber is pleased to have reached an amicable settlement with the City of New York, which has agreed to drop its appeal,&quot; said the brokerage firm said in a statement prepared in answer to a question about the matter.</p>
<p>A spokesman for PaineWebber declined to provide any details about the settlement, and a New York City official was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The New York Post in mid-February said that the city stood to lose about $7.2 million in back taxes because it missed a deadline by one day. A city tax judge had ruled in favor of the brokerge house, a decision New York City had appealed.</p>
<p>The city is in the midst of selecting underwriters for its new financing agency, the New York City Transitional Financing Authority, and for the first time it took steps to ensure that the firms and their top managers have good track records in all their dealings with the city.</p>
<p>Underwriters compete fiercely for the top spots--the most lucrative--and the city has said that it might have to reshuffle its present teams as a result of the new underwriters it was expected to choose in May or June.</p>
<p>PaineWebber now serves on the syndicate that sells the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority's bonds, a team that plans to sell about $640 million of debt on Tuesday.</p>
<p>New York City officials have stressed that the new rule was written broadly enough to cover a wide range of disputes that underwriters might have with the city, not just tax battles.</p>
<p>The city's decision to explicitly require that top brokerage house employees pay their taxes was linked to an income tax case in which a senior official at one financial firm plead guilty to a misdeamnor after being turned in for claiming he lived outside the city, and thus should be taxed as a non-resident.</p>
