<p>Polish shares on Wednesday rose for the fourth session running, setting their second-straight 30-month high and reaching 15,000 points, and analysts said the current uptrend could peak at around 15,250 points.</p>
<p>But the roughly balanced supply and demand after price-fixing made them divided on when the peak would hit.</p>
<p>&quot;Some firms such as banks are setting highs...so I think the bourse could rise to 15,200 or 15,250 points on Friday,&quot; said Sebastian Buczek, an analyst at ING BSK Asset Management.</p>
<p>Large-cap banks BPH, BRE and Bank Slaski all inched up to year highs on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index rose 0.6 percent to 15,078.7 points and turnover rose 1.9 percent to 143 million zlotys ($50.9 million) on both markets. Gainers led losers 49 to 17 with 12 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Some analysts said a profit-taking fall could start as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>Pawel Dmytryk of Bank Staropolski brokerage said the market could find support as low as 14,600 next week before buying began before the release of firms' September earnings reports at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Analysts said the scale of top gainer bank PBR's 7.3-percent jump was accidental, reflected by its relatively low 0.9-million-zloty ($0.3 million) turnover.</p>
<p>They said the treasury's Tuesday transfer of a 32.9-percent stake in PBR to state-owned Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA (PBK) was no cause for a significant PBR rally.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover was at 3.6 million zlotys ($1.3 million) with biggest mover construction firm Budimex up 4.3 percent. Mass privatisation NFI units rose 4.8 percent in continuous trade and were flat at 160 zlotys ($56.9) in the regular bourse session, where analysts saw them up on Thursday.</p>
