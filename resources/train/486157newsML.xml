<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Thursday the fate of an agreed bid by Westpac Banking Corp for the Bank of Melbourne depended on the results of the Wallis inquiry into the financial system, which is expected to be released next week.</p>
<p>Costello told a news conference called to discuss the A$1.435 billion bid that he would deal with the merger after the release of the report and neither bank should yet presume any outcome.  </p>
<p>&quot;Any application for a merger between Westpac and the Bank of Melbourne will be determined in accordance with that policy, policy as announced in response to the Wallis report,&quot; Costello told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The application will not be dealt with until that policy is announced and it will be determined in accordance with that policy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Costello said last week he expected to release the Wallis inquiry report sometime in the week beginning April 7.</p>
<p>The inquiry, headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, is the first major review of Australian finance sector regulations since the early 1980s.</p>
<p>It is expected to include a recommendation to end the current &quot;six pillars&quot; policy which prevents mergers between the four big Australian banks and the two largest life offices.  </p>
<p>&quot;I make it clear that they shouldn't presume any outcome until we make an announcement and when the announcement's made, this will be determined like any other applications in accordance with that announcement,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>&quot;No priority will be given to applications which seek to anticipate that announcement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are entitled to take their own risks, but I want to emphasise it's their risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Westpac earlier announced plans to merge with Bank of Melbourne under a scheme of arrangement which valued the Victorian-based bank at A$1.435 billion.  </p>
<p>Banking legislation gives the Treasurer a veto over such mergers in addition to any determinations of the monopolies watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p>
<p>Canberra's policy since the days of the former Labor government has been to generally let small financial institutions merge with each other and to oppose combinations of large institutions, notably the big four banks and the two biggest life insurance offices.</p>
<p>The policy on mergers between large and small institutions has been less clear cut.  </p>
<p>The Liberal-National government says it will determine its future policy on all aspects of financial industry regulation after it has considered the recommendations of the Wallis report.</p>
