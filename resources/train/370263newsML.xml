<p>NOTES TO STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Note 1: Basis of Presentation Time Warner has interests in four fundamental areas of business:Entertainment, consisting principally of interests in recorded music and music publishing, filmed entertainment, television production, broadcasting and theme parks; Cable Networks, consisting principally of interests in cable television programming and sports franchises;Publishing, consisting principally of interests in magazine publishing, book publishing and direct marketing; and Cable, consisting principally of interests in cable television systems. Certain of Time Warner's interests in filmed entertainment, television production, broadcasting, theme parks and cable television programming, and a majority of its cable television systems, are held through Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (&quot;TWE&quot;), a partnership in which Time Warner owns general and limited partnership interests in 74.49% of the pro rata priority capital (&quot;Series A Capital&quot;) and residual equity capital (&quot;Residual Capital&quot;) and 100% of the senior priority capital (&quot;Senior Capital&quot;) and junior priority capital (&quot;Series B Capital&quot;). The remaining 25.51% limited partnership interests in the Series A Capital and Residual Capital of TWE are held by a subsidiary of US WEST, Inc. Time Warner does not consolidate TWE and certain related companies (the &quot;Entertainment Group&quot;) for financial reporting purposes. No portion of TWE's net income for the year ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 was allocated to the limited partnership interests. The operating results of Time Warner reflect the acquisitions of Summit Communications Group, Inc. effective as of May 2, 1995, KBLCOM Incorporated effective as of July 6, 1995, Cablevision Industries Corporation and related companies effective as of January 4, 1996 and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (&quot;TBS&quot;) effective as of October 10, 1996. The operating results of the Entertainment Group reflect the formation of the TWE-Advance/Newhouse Partnership effective as of April 1, 1995, the deconsolidation of Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (&quot;Six Flags&quot;) effective as of June 23, 1995 and the consolidation of Paragon Communications effective as of July 6, 1995. The operating results of Six Flags prior to June 23, 1995 are reported separately to facilitate comparability.</p>
<p>Note 2: TBS Transaction On October 10, 1996, Time Warner acquired the remaining 80% interest in TBS that it did not already own. In connection therewith, Time Warner issued or agreed to issue approximately 178.4 million shares of common stock to the former shareholders of TBS capital stock, approximately 14 million stock options to replace all outstanding TBS stock options and $67 million of consideration payable, at the election of Time Warner, in either cash or additional shares of common stock. Time Warner also assumed approximately $2.8 billion of indebtedness. The acquisition cost of approximately $6.2 billion was preliminarily allocated to the net assets acquired in accordance with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations.</p>
<p>Note 3:  Income Taxes The relationship between income before income taxes and income tax expense of Time Warner is affected by the amortization of goodwill and certain other financial statement expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes. Income tax expense of Time Warner includes all income taxes related to its allocable share of partnership income and its equity in the income tax expense of corporate subsidiaries of the Entertainment Group.</p>
