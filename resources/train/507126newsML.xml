<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss stocks end lower.</title>
<headline>Swiss stocks end lower.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-04-14</dateline>

<p>Swiss shares recovered from a weak opening to close only slightly easier on Monday. Major investors stayed away from the market but Swiss shares drew some support from the firmer dollar and from short covering.</p>
<p>Dealers said that although the market shrugged off Wall Street's losses the U.S. share market was likely to determine future developments.</p>
<p>The blue-Chip SMI was down 17.9 to 4,586.3 after an intraday low of 4,537.3 and the broad SPI lost 10.97 to end at 2,906.88.</p>
<p>Roche, down 320 to 11,930, led the actives list. Dealers said some investors sold Roche ahead of 1997 first quarter sales data, due for release on Tuesday. Roche is also holding its annual news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cement producer Holderbank, due to release 1996 results on Tuesday after the market closes, firmed seven francs to 1,128.</p>
<p>Several analysts recently issued &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on Holderbank although some expected a slight drop in its 1996 profit.</p>
<p>Nestle recouped early losses to close 17 francs higher at 1,717.</p>
<p>Insurers closed mixed to easier while cyclical shares were mixed to higher.</p>
<p>Among banks, UBS rose two to 1,309. Dealers said there was some buying ahead of the UBS shareholder meeting on Thursday. CS group lost 2.25 francs to finish at 159.50. SBC eased 0.50 to close at 293.</p>
<p>Second tier shares saw strong gains in SEZ, Stratec, Belimo and Zellweger. Logitech, Zschokke, Agie and Valora were subject to profit taking.</p>
