<p>A Clinton administration attorney attempted Wednesday to persuade the Supreme Court to uphold a law regulating indecent words and pictures on the Internet to shield children from sexually explicit material.</p>
<p>&quot;The Internet threatens to give every child with access to an interactive computer a free pass into the equivalent of every adult bookstore and video outlet in the country,&quot; government attorney Seth Waxman said during arguments in the historic case about free-speech rights in cyberspace.</p>
<p>But Bruce Ennis, an attorney representing a diverse coalition that challenged the law, replied that the measure amounted to unconstitutional government censorship that violates free-speech rights of adult Internet users.</p>
<p>&quot;This law is a ban on indecent speech in cyberspace,&quot; he said of the year-old measure approved by Congress and signed by President Clinton. The law imposes government regulation on the worldwide computer network used by an estimated 40 million people.</p>
<p>The law makes it a crime punishable by up to two years in prison to transmit sexually explicit material to anyone younger than 18. But the law bars prosecution of people who put indecent material on Internet transmitters if they take &quot;reasonable, effective and appropriate actions&quot; to restrict access to minors.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the real democratizing aspects of the Internet is that average citizens can speak to the world for free,&quot; Ennis said, warning that the law inhibits speakers in so-called chat rooms and affects what individuals put on the World Wide Web, the graphical, point-and-click section of the Interet.</p>
<p>He argued that the law will not be effective because children still will be able to get access to indecent material posted on the Internet in foreign nations, and said less restrictive measures, including parental control, were available.</p>
<p>During 70 minutes of arguments, the high court justices vigorously questioned both sides about the rapidly changing Internet technology and whether minors could be prevented from accessing sexually explicit material.</p>
<p>The justices appeared sceptical of the government's defence of the law, but gave no clear sign of how they would rule. A decision in the landmark case, which could affect future regulation of the Internet, is due by July.</p>
<p>Waxman, the Justice Department's deputy solicitor general, told the court an estimated 8,000 sexually explicit sites already existed on the Web, and that the number would double every nine months.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is very, very serious,&quot; he said, adding that minors could be stopped from accessing indecent material through the use of credit cards and adult identification numbers, which cost as little as $5 a year.</p>
<p>But Justice Stephen Breyer questioned whether the government might prosecute a group of high school students who, in an Internet chat-room, discuss their sexual experiences.</p>
<p>&quot;That's been known to happen in high school,&quot; Breyer said. The law would make &quot;a large number of high school students guilty of a federal crime.&quot;</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia interjected, asking, &quot;There's no high school exemption?&quot; as the courtroom erupted in laughter.</p>
<p>Waxman sought to salvage his argument by saying the law sought to prevent a high school student from using a computer in a bedroom to get access to Penthouse, Hustler or other sexually explicit material that normally would not be sold to a minor.</p>
<p>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor seemed concerned about the restrictions, describing the Internet as &quot;a public place because anyone can get online and have a conversation. It is much like a street corner or a park.&quot;</p>
<p>Waxman said computer software to keep minors out of sexually explicit sites was not feasible. &quot;There simply is no way (parents and software companies) can keep up with what can or cannot be screened out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ennis emphasised that he had challenged only the law's restrictions on &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot; material, not already illegal child pornography and obscene material.</p>
<p>He said the law goes too far and would make it a crime for parents to send an e-mail message to their college freshman child that might be considered indecent by others.</p>
