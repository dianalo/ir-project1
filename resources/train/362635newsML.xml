<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-DUMARS TO REPLACE MOURNING IN ALL-STAR GAME.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Miami Heat centre Alonzo Mourning will miss Sunday's All-Star Game with a right heel injury and Detroit Pistons guard Joe Dumars was named as his replacement by NBA Commissioner David Stern on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Mourning injured the heel in Wednesday night's 118-117 victory at Boston. The 26-year-old centre was in street clothes for Thursday night's home game against the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Dumars is a 12-year veteran and the last link in Detroit to the teams that won back-to-back championships in 1989-90. He will be making his sixth All-Star appearance and is averaging 14.5 points per game. Dumars is eighth in the league in three-point field-goal percentage at 43.3.</p>
<p>Mourning is averaging 19.5 points and 10.2 rebounds in 46 games for the Heat, who have won five straight and lead the Atlantic Division.</p>
<p>The list of players knocked out of the All-Star Game by injury is becoming a long one.</p>
<p>New York Knicks centre Patrick Ewing, voted an Eastern Conference starter, will miss the All-Star Game with a groin injury, while the Western Conference will be without guard Clyde Drexler and forward Charles Barkley of the Houston Rockets and centre Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>Drexler aggravated a hamstring injury Tuesday while Barkley remains sidelined with an ankle sprain. O'Neal has a sprained knee ligament.</p>
