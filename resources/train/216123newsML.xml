<p>Analysts agree the perennial outperformance of Wolters Kluwer and Elsevier  justifies the lofty multiples at which their shares trade, but opinions differ over which is the better choice for investors.</p>
<p>Jeff Meys of ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said Wolters Kluwer and Elsevier stood out, even among the company of other highly regarded professional and business publishers such as Thomson Corp , Dow Jones and Reuters .</p>
<p>&quot;Their operating performance is head and shoulders above that of their competitors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Both companies have a long track record of steadily improving their operating margins, which at over 20 percent already rank among the the highest in the industry.</p>
<p>Elsevier, which merged with Reed International in 1993, earns margins of some 40 percent in science publishing, while both companies have margins of 20-30 percent in tax and legal publishing.</p>
<p>With such high margins and revenues which derive largely from advance subscription payments, Wolters Kluwer and Elsevier generate a large free cash flow which they have used to acquire other businesses and improve their profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;Acquisitions do not come cheaply in this business, but they have consistently shown that they can run the companies they acquire more profitably than the previous owners,&quot; Meys said.</p>
<p>This process has been driven by a common knack for identifying profitable niche products which can be marketed at little extra cost from existing resources.</p>
<p>Meys cites the example of Elsevier starting with a medical journal about the arm, then spinning off sister journals about the wrist, the hand and the fingers.</p>
<p>Paul Schram of Bank Bangert Pontier said both companies had made important U.S. acquisitions which would help to accelerate their growth in electronic publishing.</p>
<p>&quot;Elsevier with Lexis-Nexis and Wolters with CCH have found a new motor for growth for the next few years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wolters acquired tax publisher CCH in early 1996 while Reed Elsevier bought database operator Lexis-Nexis in late 1994.</p>
<p>Andre Moons of ING Barings said Wolters Kluwer had told analysts that it expected to raise the operating margin of CCH from 22 percent now to 28 percent in three to four years.</p>
<p>&quot;That shows you how confident they feel about their American activities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the last five years Wolters Kluwer shares have notched up a cumulative outperformance of 70 percent over the AEX Dutch share index and 14 percent outperformance for the year to date.</p>
<p>Elsevier has outperformed the AEX by 40 percent over the last five years and by five percent in the year to date.</p>
<p>Moons said their strong track record translated into high multiples, with Wolters Kluwer currently trading at a 1996 price-earnings ratio of about 28 and Elsevier at about 25, premiums of some 65 and 50 percent respectively to the AEX.</p>
<p>&quot;Wolters Kluwer is a bit more expensive than Elsevier but I think that's justified. Wolters is more tightly focused and has virtually no cyclical activities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the 1995 sale of its newspaper operations, Elsevier still retains some cyclically sensitive businesses such as consumer books and trade exhibitions.</p>
<p>Moons said this meant Wolters Kluwer would probably perform better than Elsevier during periods of economic weakness. He rates rates Wolters a buy and Elsevier a hold.</p>
<p>Meys said he had a short-term preference for Wolters Kluwer but a long-term preference for Elsevier because he believed its markets would show stronger growth in the long run.</p>
<p>As a result of the CCH acquisition, Wolters Kluwer's cash flow would probably grow more quickly in the short term, but using estimated 1997 price to free cash flow multiples, Wolters was slightly cheaper at 15.1 versus 15.5 for Elsevier, he said.</p>
<p>On the same measure, Meys calculated multiples of 13.7 for Thomson and 11.0 for Reuters, noting that a higher multiple generally indicated expectations of faster growth in cash flow.</p>
<p>Meys rates both Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer a hold for the time being, based in part on the assumption that publishers with newspaper interests and banks will perform strongly in 1997.</p>
<p>Bangert Pontier's Schram said that since the CCH acquisition there had been a widening gap in the price-earnings ratios of Wolters Kluwer and Elsevier.</p>
<p>On the basis of his estimates for 1997 earnings the gap had stretched from 1.5 price-earnings points to around five, with Elsevier on a multiple of 21 and Wolters Kluwer on 26, he said.</p>
<p>Schram said this reflected investors' approval of the CCH deal and their impatience that Elsevier had not yet made a major acquisition with the proceeds from the sale of its newspapers.</p>
<p>However, the tide could turn suddenly, with Elsevier shares likely to leap higher if the company netted another big fish.</p>
<p>&quot;We could be at the start of a new period of outperformance by Elsevier...I've had a preference for Elsevier for some time now because its 'good news potential' is greater,&quot; he said.</p>
