<p>By Cheryl Juckes,</p>
<p>UK government bonds (gilts) are in for another gloomy week, beset by continuing worries that U.S. interest rates will have to rise again to contain inflation as well as concerns that British inflation is creeping up.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be very hard to see a gilt rally given the international backdrop,&quot; said HSBC economist Don Smith.</p>
<p>Tuesday's U.S. March consumer price data are expected to show a monthly increase of 0.3 percent in the core measure, with the headline measure forecast to have risen by 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts warn that a stronger than expected batch of data is likely to fuel fears further that U.S. interest rates will rise by 25 basis points at the May 20 Federal Open Markets Committee meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Add a poor consumer price number and the odds of 20 May rate hike will shorten. That is likely to hit U.S. bonds and they in turn will drag down Europe,&quot; NatWest Markets European bond strategist Huw Roberts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've also got some inflation worries of our own, with the earnings part of Labour report out on Wednesday and the RPI on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect if you do get any kind of rally then you should be looking to sell that,&quot; he said. UK average earnings for February are forecast to have risen by 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the underlying retail price measure for March, due on Thursday to have edged back to 2.8 from 2.9 percent -- still well above the 2.5 percent or lower official target.</p>
<p>The UK had some better news on the inflation front in the form of weaker than expected producer price data for March published on Monday and these gave gilts some support. But analysts said the strength of the service sector more than offset continued sluggishness in manufacturing.</p>
<p>&quot;While today's numbers are very good and suggest inflation is not a real problem for the manufacturing sector, it is just giving us a snapshot of a relatively small part of the economy,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist of CIBC.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates will probably still have to go up after the election,&quot; he said, predicting a rise of 50 basis points in Britain's 6.0 percent interest rates after the May 1 election.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party, which is widely expected to win the election after 18 years in opposition, is likely to be extremely hawkish on inflation as it seeks to win market credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;A new Labour government will result in a new sense of anti-inflation zeal,&quot; HSBC's Smith said. He argued that the brunt of the bad news on inflation would be borne by the short end, whilst the long end was insulated by the belief Labour would hammer inflation.</p>
<p>The market is also awaiting the details the amount of 7.0-percent gilts due 2002 for the April 23 gilt auction.</p>
