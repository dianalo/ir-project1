<p>Morocco's authoritative Centre Marocain de Conjoncture (CMC) economic forecasting institute predicted the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow by 3.7 percent in real terms in 1997 after 11 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997, the Moroccan economy will grow in real terms by 3.7 percent of GDP against 11 percent in 1996,&quot; Habib El Malki, director of the Casablanca-based centre, told a news conference late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the forecast was based on an average agricultural year with a harvest of between 8.0 million tonnes and 8.5 million tonnes of cereals in 1996/97 season.</p>
<p>He said agriculture, mining and construction were the main sectors which would pull up the growth indicators.</p>
<p>The three sectors would grow respectively by 2.5 percent, 6.2 percent and 5.0 percent next year.</p>
<p>According to figures released by the agriculture ministry earlier this year the cereals harvest rose to 9.75 million tonnes in 1995/96 season against 1.7 million tonnes in 1994/95 agricultural season which was hit by severe drought.</p>
<p>According to Bank al-Maghrib (centre bank), Morocco's GDP was 276.9 billion dirhams ($31.8 billion) in 1995. Agriculture normally represents around 20 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The CMC figure of 11 percent growth in Morocco's GDP in 1996 coincided with the forecast made earlier by the finance ministry.</p>
<p>The ministry said, however, that it expected a 5.0 percent growth in 1997 due to a normal cereals harvest.</p>
<p>&quot;As the growth indicator reached a climax of 11 percent in 1996, it will undoubtedly decline to less than 4.0 percent,&quot; a CMC expert said.</p>
<p>The centre said that with two consecutive years of positive growth (1996/1997), unemployment would stabilise around 16 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment in Morocco is a structural issue, it takes years before the country's economy could respond to tens of thousands of job demands every year,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Finance ministry officials have forecast unemployment would rise by 1.0 point in 1997 to 17 percent, mainly in the urban centres.</p>
<p>Morocco has an estimated 10-million workforce of which 50 percent is employed in the countryside.</p>
<p>The Moroccan government changed the fiscal year to run from July to June, instead of the calendar year, following a referendum last year.</p>
