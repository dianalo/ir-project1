<p>The Vietnamese government is split over whether to continue granting investment licences to foreign car manufacturers, who are eyeing an already crowded market, Vice Minister for Industry Nguyen Xuan Chuan said on Friday.</p>
<p>Chuan said an application by South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co Ltd and a local partner for a $240-million plant had been held up because Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and others believed too many projects had already been approved.</p>
<p>Asked about the split in opinion, he told Reuters, &quot;It's about 50-50.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Kiet would make a decision on the Hyundai project after receiving a report from the Industry Ministry, the Ministry of Planning and Information and the joint venture investor.</p>
<p>Fourteen foreign vehicle makers have already received licences to build cars in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Some industry executives say that is too many for a country in which just 39,800 vehicles were sold last year. But Chuan argues that the market could top 100,000 units within 10 years, equivalent to 77 percent of projected production capacity.</p>
<p>He said the government's policy of obliging manufacturers to produce 30 percent of their components locally after 10 years of operation meant there was no need to limit the number of players.</p>
<p>&quot;Either we will base on the number of projects or we will base our prime interest on localisation,&quot; he said. &quot;If we base our prime interest on localisation, we don't care about the number of investors.&quot;</p>
<p>Chuan said a local newspaper report that Kiet had already rejected the Hyundai proposal was not true.</p>
<p>He said a Hyundai official in charge of the project had been dismissed for causing the misunderstanding. Hyundai's offices in Vietnam declined to comment.</p>
