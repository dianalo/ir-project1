<headline>UK gilt repo trade busy, 7% 2002 still strong.</headline>

<p>The UK gilt repo market was enjoying a hectic session on Thursday with a large number of bonds attracting particular attention.</p>
<p>The scarce 7.0 percent 2002 stock was still the star performer, securing overnight funds for between 0.5 and 2.5 percent compared with general collateral (GC) rates of 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>But dealers were beginning to ask themselves how long its allure could last.</p>
<p>&quot;The only question left is not who has got them, nor who needs them, but whether the sqeeze ends before or after the weekend,&quot; said Kleinwort Benson dealer Paul Chapman. &quot;My guess is before.&quot;</p>
<p>But other dealers were hopeful that the high demand would continue until Monday. &quot;I think it will come off the boil on Monday but I'm quite happy at the moment-- I'm long,&quot; said another repo trader.</p>
<p>The 6.0 percent gilt due 1999 is tipped as the next hot favourite. Dealers said it was on normal GC rates in the overnight but could garner one month loans at 5.0 percent, around 90 basis points below GC rates.</p>
<p>Other stocks in demand included the 6-3/4 percent 2004 stock which offered loans at 30 basis points through GC rates in maturities of one month and over. Dealers said there was a likelihood of a squeeze in the stock over the weekend.</p>
<p>There was also plenty of trade in the 8.0-percent 2000 and 7.0-percent 2001 gilts.</p>
