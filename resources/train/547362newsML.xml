<p>Shares in French state-controlled insurer Groupe GAN tumbled more than five percent on Tuesday after it reported a bigger than expected 5.7 billion franc ($977.3 million) loss for 1996 late on Monday.</p>
<p>The shares closed down eight francs at 143 francs after at least one brokerage downgraded its recommendation on its share to sell from buy.</p>
<p>The loss had been forecast at five billion francs by the government in February. The 1996 result included provisions of 13.8 billion for bad real estate loans and investments accumulated by several of GAN's units. The 1996 loss compared to a 1995 loss of 1.79 billion francs.</p>
<p>GAN has been promised a government aid package of at least 20 billion francs to ready it for privatisation expected to carried out this year.</p>
<p>Paris brokerage Cheuvreux de Virieu cut its recommendation on the shares to &quot;sell&quot; from &quot;buy&quot;, citing the results and said the share price was close to the 152 francs it believed would be GAN's re-evaluated net asset value after recapitalisation.</p>
<p>GAN chairman Didier Pfeiffer said GAN's CIC banking arm was likely to be privatised ahead of its insurance activities and that both should be sold off before year end.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer said he had hoped to privatise the two together &quot;but when we look at the national and international players, it seemed very difficult to achieve&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This has led us to look at doing the two privatisations separately and the feeling is that it is better to privatise CIC before GAN,&quot; he said. He said it was the best way to maintain the &quot;bancassurance&quot; links between GAN and CIC involving selling insurance products through the banking operations.</p>
<p>GAN is hoping that after a CIC sell-off it would remain the second largest shareholder in the bank with a stake &quot;that would not be below 20 percent&quot;. It currently has 93 percent.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer, appointed last November after the government fired his predecessor, was speaking at a news conference to discuss the 80.5 percent state-owned company's results.</p>
<p>The state's first attempt to sell CIC last year was abandoned in the face of widespread opposition. Bids from French banks BNP and Societe Generale were received but judged unsatisfactory. CIC made a 1996 net profit of 847 million francs, up 36 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The state has agreed to inject 11 billion into parent GAN this year, including 7.1 billion to recapitalise what finance minister Jean Arthuis called its &quot;diseased&quot; UIC property banking subsidiary and a further 3.9 billion to bring the resources of its insurance activities up to acceptable regulatory levels.</p>
<p>The government has promised to cover losses on bad loans to property developers and losses on property sales and estimated the cost of that operation at a further nine billion francs.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer said after a thorough cleanup of 1996 accounts CIC and GAN would be &quot;free of the need for exceptional charges which weighed on them in the past&quot;. The time was now ripe for GAN's sale which &quot;could come as of this financial exercise&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>GAN's recapitalisation is expected to be carried out this summer. The method should be settled at a board meeting prior to the June 25 annual shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer said the state aid was an integral part of GAN's 1996 accounts and it was &quot;essential&quot; that the European Union, which must clear state help, decide whether to approve the aid before the shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer said GAN's purchaser would need to be involved in complementary activities. He said his group was &quot;proceeding systematically&quot; to examine GAN's similiarities with potential partners, which he said included AGF, Allianz, Fortis, Generali and ING.</p>
<p>As for CIC, besides BNP and Societe Generale which showed interest during the initial but now defunct sale tender, other French or foreign banks could be interested, he said.</p>
<p>CIC is valued in GAN's book at a total 14.6 billion francs while the previous offers were around 10 billion francs.</p>
