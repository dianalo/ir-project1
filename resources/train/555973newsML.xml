<p>Philippine grains importers, who were mostly sidelined by high U.S. prices this week, are expected to be back next week on price dips, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still buyers for wheat and corn,&quot; said one senior Manila grains trader.</p>
<p>Philippine mills had expressed interest in buying at least 60,000 tonnes of wheat for June shipment this week. &quot;The firms rejected all bids due to high prices,&quot; said a senior trader.</p>
<p>Traders said the mills held tenders for 35,000 tonnes of wheat early this week, and another 25,000 tonnes on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We were set to buy 10,000 tonnes of dark northern spring wheat and 15,000 tonnes of western white wheat today but we got high prices,&quot; said an executive in one of the Philippine mills that sought tenders on U.S. wheat early today.</p>
<p>Grains traders submitted a price of over $200 per tonne FOB for dark northern spring wheat and at least $183 per tonne for western white wheat.</p>
<p>Last week, price of dark northern spring wheat was pegged at $198 per tonne FOB while western white wheat fetched $180 per tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours that Pakistan may buy around 350,000 tonnes of wheat at the weekend inflated prices of U.S. wheat.&quot; the Philippine flour mill executive said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will look at the market again next week. We will buy at price dips,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On corn, Philippine feed millers and swine and poultry farmers said they were still waiting government's approval on their proposed importation of between 300,000 and 350,000 tonnes of yellow corn for animal feed due to a local shortage of the commodity.</p>
<p>&quot;Agriculture officials promised us in a meeting on Wednesday to endorse to President Fidel Ramos the industry's application to import at least 300,000 tonnes of yellow corn at 35 percent tariff between May and June this year,&quot; an official in a Philippine feedmill told Reuters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philippine soybean and soymeal buyers are expected to be out of the market next week due to ample supply.</p>
<p>Retail prices of wheat and corn were as follows, in pesos:</p>
<p>						     May 2     April 25</p>
<p>    Hard wheat flour, per 25 kg bag	290	    290</p>
<p>    Soft wheat flour, per 25 kg bag	260	    260</p>
<p>    Yellow corn, per kg		     9.81	   9.81</p>
