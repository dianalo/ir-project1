<p>TORIES PLAN TO PRIVATIZE PENSION PROVISION</p>
<p>Prime minister John Major has unveiled plans to privatize Britain's state pension system, in what would be the most radical reform of the welfare state since 1945. The announcement on the welfare state 'revolution' was timed to steal the initiative from Labour in the run up to the general election campaign, although Major emphasised that the plans, which will take half a century to complete, will benefit people who are presently just of voting age or below.</p>
<p>-- GEC WILL SETUP JOINT VENTURES WITH GROUP FROM ITALY</p>
<p>Defence company GEC-Marconi is to establish a series of joint ventures with Italian engineering group Finmeccanica , in a move which will accelerate the consolidation of the European defence industry. The Italian government is currently looking at how best to sell its majority stake in Finmeccanica, with GEC an obvious potential bidder. Turnover of the combined business could reach 1 billion stg, with interests likely to include naval electronics, radar, missile seekers and torpedoes.</p>
<p>-- BAT CHIEF SEEKS DEAL TO SETTLE SMOKERS' LAWSUITS</p>
<p>BAT Industries has called for an industry-wide settlement of legal actions brought against it and other tobacco companies on behalf of smokers and former smokers in the US. BAT, the largest British-owned cigarette maker, said that it and the US tobacco industry would listen to any 'sensible proposals' from the plaintiff's lawyers and state attorneys general. BAT, which has made no provisions against losing cases, has 16.6 per cent of the US cigarette market.</p>
<p>-- BRUSSELS URGES WORKER SAFEGUARDS</p>
<p>The European Commission is to look at whether EU laws on worker consultation need to be strengthened in the wake of the decision by Renault SA to close a profitable factory in Belgium with the loss of 3,100 jobs. Social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn has also been asked to produce recommendations on strengthening workers' rights. The EU intervention, which comes amid strong public and political criticism of Renault over the decision, is likely to anger Eurosceptics in the UK who oppose further EU legislation in social matters.</p>
<p>-- UTILITIES ACCEPT BAN ON MERGERS</p>
<p>PowerGen and National Power , the UK's main electricity generators, have accepted a department of trade and industry ban on their proposed mergers with regional electricity companies. PowerGen had attempted to merge with Midlands Electricity, and National Power with Southern Electric, last spring. The DTI objected to the plans on competition grounds.</p>
<p>-- MPS WARNED AGAINST BAN ON CLONING RESEARCH</p>
<p>The Human Fertilization and Embryology Association (HFEA) has urged MPs that Parliament should not rush into a blanket ban on human cloning research. The comments, given to an inquiry by the Commons science and technology committee, follow the birth of the cloned sheep 'Dolly' at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh. Members and advisers of the Authority warned against a 'panic reaction' to the issue, and stressed that such research could provide ethically acceptable benefits for humans.</p>
<p>-- MILLENNIUM BUSINESS TICKS ALONG FOR COMPUTER GROUPS</p>
<p>Two computer services groups reported a sharp increase in millennium-related business Wednesday, but went on to stress that the real money is likely to come from the onset of Emu. The companies, Micro Focus and Parity, both said that business connected to the problem of computers coping with the millennium date change had helped lift profits. But both companies also said that the more challenging and complex problem will be coping with the move to Emu.</p>
<p>-- BICC SEES 200 MILLION STG EXPANSION IN CABLES</p>
<p>Cables and construction group BICC has reported a move back into profit, and pledged to increase spending on higher margin cable operations by 40 per cent this year. BICC reported pre-tax profits of 64 million stg last year, up from a loss of 67 million stg the previous year. Announcing the results, the company said it plans to accelerate its investment in data and telecommunications cables as part of a 200 million stg expansion drive.</p>
<p>-- BIOTECH FILES FIRST PRODUCT FOR APPROVAL</p>
<p>British Biotech has filed its first product, the pancreas disease drug Zacutex, for panEuropean approval. British Bio, the UK's largest biotechnology company, also plans to submit Zacutex to the US FDA this year, with stockbroker Lehman Brothers forecasting peak annual sales of 300 million (184 million stg) by 2004. News of the filing came as British Bio reported reduced pre-tax losses of 1.55 million stg for the third quarter to January 31.</p>
<p>-- BT LIFTS STAKE IN AIRTEL TO 15.8 PER CENT</p>
<p>British Telecom has prepared the way for further expansion in Spain by raising its stake in Airtel, the Spanish mobile telephone company, from 7.3 per cent to 15.8 per cent. Under the deal, in which BT will acquire most of Banco Santander's shareholding in Airtel, the British company will also purchase the 50 per cent stake owned by Banco Santander in a Spanish joint venture, BT Telecomunicaciones. The deal is expected to be worth about 200 million.</p>
