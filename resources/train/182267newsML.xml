<p>Hungary's overnight interest rates continued their decline of the past few days on Tuesday as the market remained awash in money, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The funds have accumuluted in this reserve period, said Postabank's Istvan Barany. &quot;There were only smaller tax-payments, and not much money went for auctions.&quot;</p>
<p>Overnight rates finished at 21 percent, down from Monday's closing of 21.5 percent.</p>
<p>Barany said most market players had excess funds, but his impression was that only a small part of that money entered the market, with some players adopting a wait-and-see attitude.  </p>
<p>&quot;I do not know where the money is, but everybody has plenty, for sure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Unicbank's Sandor Szatmari said part of the excess funds went into one-week reverse repo deals, but less banks would use the central bank's reverse repo facility in the next few days as the end of the reserve period on November was approaching.</p>
<p>Dealers said the overnight rates were likely to continue to drop in the next few days and bottom out at about 18 percent.</p>
<p>But the rates were seen going up again in the next reserve period, partly on tax-payments due on November 20.</p>
