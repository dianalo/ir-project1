<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said on Monday there were unconfirmed reports that North Korea had deployed Rodong-1 ballistic missiles with a range of more than 1,000 km (625 miles).</p>
<p>&quot;It is not that we confirmed this,&quot; Ikeda told parliament, &quot;but there are reports that (North Korea) has developed missiles with a range of more than 1,000 km (625 miles). There are certain reports that some of them have been deployed.&quot;  </p>
<p>Asked if the United States had provided the information, Ikeda said he would refrain from citing the source.</p>
<p>It was the first time a Japanese government official has spoken of the possibility that North Korea has deployed Rodong-1 ballistic missiles, which are believed to be able to hit almost any target in Japan.</p>
<p>In its &quot;Military Balance 1996-1997&quot;, published in October 1996, the London-based Institute of International Strategic Studies (IISS) said North Korea was moving to deploy the Rodong-1 missiles in late 1996 or early 1997.</p>
<p>In May 1993, North Korea shocked Japan by test-firing the Rodong-1 into the Sea of Japan just off its coast.</p>
