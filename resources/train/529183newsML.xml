<p>European stocks were mixed in early trading on Tuesday with the Paris bourse still nervous although President Jacques Chirac reduced political uncertainty by setting snap elections for May-June.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar crept higher against the yen but failed to make much headway against the mark. The German currency has been bolstered by the French poll which casts a cloud over progress towards European monetary union.</p>
<p>After heavy losses on Monday, French shares rebounded strongly at the opening following Chirac's elections announcement. But they had shed the gains by mid-morning in volatile trading.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a small rebound,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The only thing we can foresee is that the markets will be very nervous.&quot; He and other traders said the bourse would be driven by polls from here to the election.</p>
<p>With the CAC-40 down slightly, one trader said he expected the big CAC-40 issues, in which foreign investors are most active, to be volatile.</p>
<p>In a high-stakes gamble that could make or break his presidency, Chirac dissolved the National Assembly on Monday and brought forward the election by 10 months.</p>
<p>Chirac said the early poll was needed to prepare France for a single European currency and give his centre-right coalition a five-year mandate to reform the state, reduce public spending and cut taxes and welfare charges.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin said the Socialists too favour the single currency -- but not at the price of an extra bout of austerity.</p>
<p>Employers organisation CNPF said the decision to call an early election would benefit corporate investment by reducing the period of pre-election uncertainty to one month from one year.</p>
<p>But trading was thin and the mood edgy. Stocks swung in and out of prOfit in morning trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is up because one element of uncertainty has been lifted, but it doesn't mean a lot. There is very little volume, bidding is thin on all issues. It's a wait-and-see attitude,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>London, Europe's biggest bourse, was nervous too, edging ahead only a few points with investors worried by the proximity of the May 1 general election and the possibility of an interest rate rise shortly after.</p>
<p>The blue chip FTSE 100 index was barely up on Monday night's finish at 4,328.7 points and Wall Street's close 0.65 percent down did nothing to brighten the mood in London.</p>
<p>&quot;4,350 is very much a psychological level, it's the top of the recent trading range and with Wall Street dull last night we'll struggle to get through it,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are stuck in a pre-election trading range which is deadly dull for all of us,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, stocks traded on the floor edged ahead but the computerised IBIS index made healthy gains of 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>Traders also said it appeared that the German market was benefiting from the uncertain French political outlook, with some investors apparently shifting funds out of French stocks into the DAX.</p>
<p>&quot;The German market at the moment is not following the Dow as automatically as it often does,&quot; said one dealer, adding that investors were increasingly focussing on the early recovery potential of German stocks.</p>
<p>On the currency front, dollar crept higher against the yen but kept within a narrow range. The mood was cautious ahead of the weekend meeting of G7 industrialised countries and the French election.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar made only slight progress because the German currency was helped by the new element of uncertainty over the single currency brought by the French election.</p>
<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said late Monday that an EMU delay could be considered if big countries were to miss the convergence criteria. In an earlier speech, however, Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank was working on the assumption of a timely EMU start.</p>
<p>&quot;Tietmeyer is underlining the central bank's desire for strict interpretation of the criteria and has raised the issue that a delay is better than a fudge,&quot; said a U.S. bank dealer.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.7080 marks and 126.15 yen after ending at 1.7035 and 125.63 in late trading in Europe on Monday.</p>
