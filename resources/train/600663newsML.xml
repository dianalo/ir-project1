<p>An Asian dynasty-drama of wealth and power has unfolded another chapter with the appointment of a low-key lawyer as Hong Kong's first post-colonial top judge</p>
<p>Barrister Andrew Li is scion of one of Hong Kong's most prominent Chinese banking and legal dynasties.</p>
<p>Li, 48, was plucked from outside the judiciary to be Chief Justice under Chinese rule from July 1.</p>
<p>Acclaimed as the right man for a difficult job, he comes from an influential Hong Kong family where success at the top is a standard feature. But he has for years shunned the limelight sought by some of his more extrovert relations.</p>
<p>The modest, some say prim, British-educated lawyer was named on Tuesday by future leader Tung Chee-hwa whose plans to dilute civil liberties have aroused concern with the pro-democracy lobby and Western nations.</p>
<p>In the weeks remaining until the handover of Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30, Li's primary task is to establish a Court of Final Appeal to replace the British Privy Council as the highest court for the territory's 6.4 million people.</p>
<p>He has the task of ensuring the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary and legal system in the face of doomsayers who see the territory falling prey to &quot;cronyism&quot; from across the border, where &quot;guanxi&quot;, using the right connections, is common.</p>
<p>Like his civil servant father, Cambridge-educated Li chose against a career in the banking empire founded by his great-grandfather Li Sek-pang in 1918.</p>
<p>Instead, he entered the complex world of civil law, building a reputation as a cautious and impartial advocate, known for his intellectual rigour and independence.</p>
<p>Li qualified for the British bar in 1970 and became a Queen's Counsel (QC) -- or senior advocate -- in 1988. He has served temporarily as a deputy high court judge.</p>
<p>His reputation for hard work and behind-the-scenes public service caught Governor Chris Patten's eye in 1992.</p>
<p>Patten appointed Li to the most powerful body in colonial Hong Kong -- the Executive Council which serves as the governor's inner cabinet of advisers.</p>
<p>Patten paid tribute to his former adviser and praised Tung's selection of Li who was picked from a list of more than 140 names.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very good news for the rule of law in Hong Kong that such a distinguished lawyer should have been chosen for this post,&quot; Patten told Hong Kong radio from London.</p>
<p>Li has had to resign from the Executive Council and give up his stewardship of the influential Hong Kong Jockey Club -- he is an enthusiastic racegoer. He also has to relinquish his British citizenship to comply with post-1997 citizenship qualifications for senior officials.</p>
<p>When China's flag rises over Hong Kong on July 1, Li will step into a post coveted by his father's cousin Simon Li, who in 1971 became the first ethnic Chinese judge in the British dominated judiciary to be appointed to the High Court.</p>
<p>Li senior became the first Chinese justice of appeal in 1984 but was beaten in the race to become the first Chinese Chief Justice by his junior, Ti Liang Yang.</p>
<p>The younger Li will be entitled to move into Yang's former mansion on Victoria Peak which comes complete with floodlit tennis courts, two chefs and four servants.</p>
<p>Li is no stranger to luxury. The Li family bank, the Bank of East Asia run by distant cousin David Li, is the territory's largest Hong Kong-Chinese owned bank with a market value of HK$38 billion (US$4.9 billion).</p>
<p>In addition to banker David Li and former appeal court judge Simon Li, other members of the Li clan include David's brother Arthur, a surgeon and vice chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Simon's lawyer daughter, Gladys, a former chairwoman of the Hong Kong Bar Association.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-born Li is married and has two daughters aged 22 and 19.</p>
