<p>Three Swedish banks reported strong first quarter figures on Tuesday with falling loan losses and increased savings, but analysts were concerned about their bond portfolios' poor performance.</p>
<p>Nordbanken and Foreningsbanken said higher first quarter interest rates pushed their bond portfolios into the red and S-E-Banken showed a sharp profit fall on its bond holdings.</p>
<p>If the banks choose to get rid of their bonds, they might send interest rates even higher, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If interest rates keep rising or remain at this level, banks might start selling off bonds and other securities,&quot; Jonny Sylven, analyst at Swedbank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;If they all start selling, or change positions from long yields to short, the market will become saturated and interest rates will rise. Then banks might feel forced to sell more and we have a vicious circle.&quot;</p>
<p>Nordbanken was hurt the most by its poor bond portfolio performance which caused its operating profit to fall 10 percent to 1.40 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The other two managed to increase their operating profit with S-E-Banken showing a 17 percent rise to 1.50 billion crowns and Foreningsbanken posting a 24 percent jump to 278 million crowns.</p>
<p>Nordbanken posted a 128 million crown net loss on financial operations, or its bond portfolio, compared to a 245 million crown profit in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;It surprises me that Nordbanken keeps its large bond portfolio,&quot; Sylven said.</p>
<p>&quot;S-E-Banken has a more obvious interest in having large assets as it is involved in investment banking.&quot;</p>
<p>S-E-Banken showed the net result of financial transactions plummeting 68 percent to 332 million crowns and Foreningsbanken posted a loss of 44 million crowns compared to a profit of 31 million crowns.</p>
<p>On the positive side, analysts noted falling loan losses and stronger savings.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a trend with significantly lower loan losses,&quot; said an analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;Swedish interest rates have come down (from 1995 highs) which means that more people can handle their loans so we are likely to see falling loan losses also in remaining quarters.&quot;</p>
<p>Interest rates fell sharply between April 1995 and January 1997, when they began to rise again, but are still far from 1995 levels when the ten-year bond yield was at 11.60 percent. The ten-year bond is currently trading at 7.31 percent.</p>
<p>But loan losses are not likely to fall further in 1998 as they are already at such low levels, the analyst added. Nordbanken showed a loan loss level of 0.7 percent of lending, S-E-Banken of 0.24 percent and Foreningsbanken of 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Nordbanken, Handelsbanken and Swedbank have said they think loan losses will remain this low, while S-E-Banken has said they expect them to be higher when economic trends pick up,&quot; Sylven said.</p>
<p>The banks also benefited from higher savings with increased net commission and higher deposits, which cheered analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;But from society's point of view you wonder if there will be enough money for other things than savings,&quot; Sylven said, referring to sluggish domestic trends which would be helped by increased consumption.</p>
