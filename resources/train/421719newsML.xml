<p>Turkey's politicians on Wednesday ignored pleas from Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan that the army was subverting democracy and demanded he toe the secularist line laid out by the generals.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister said it was a time for solidarity to protect democracy and that he expected cooperation from us,&quot; main opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz told reporters after talks with the prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;I told him we did not agree. I said it was up to him to clear up the problem,&quot; Yilmaz said.</p>
<p>The National Security Council, dominated by the military commanders, at the weekend demanded Erbakan approve a broad crackdown on religious activism, which they charged was largely fostered by his Islam-based Welfare party.</p>
<p>Turkey's three biggest trade unions, meanwhile, said the army's move to quell alleged Islamist separatism had the full support of their six million members. The biggest leftist parties delivered a similar message on Tuesday.</p>
<p>So far, Erbakan's riposte that true democracy meant his government answered only to parliament, not to the army, has fallen on deaf ears.</p>
<p>And he has so far side-stepped speculation he would resign. &quot;The system in Turkey is sound. There is no crisis,&quot; Erbakan told a news conference.</p>
<p>He later went into an unscheduled meeting with coalition partner Tansu Ciller, a pro-Western conservative.</p>
<p>The stalemate has thrown financial markets into a tizzy, as worries mount that ambitious reform and privatisation targets may not be met.</p>
<p>Shares were off 4.5 percent in afternoon trade and bond-yields were up sharply for the third day running, jumping 6-8 percentage points to around 110 percent.</p>
<p>Mainstream newspapers and television channels have joined the chorus of approval for the NSC, with some even urging the army to intervene directly and topple the government. Nightly street demonstrations have also targetted the Islamists.</p>
<p>This groundswell behind the military chiefs, who have three times before deposed elected governments, reflects widespread respect for the armed forces among Turkey's secular majority as a bulwark against religious extremism.</p>
<p>&quot;Modern, secular democracy is in danger,&quot; said the three union chiefs in a joint letter to party leaders. &quot;This is why we support the National Security Council decisions.&quot;</p>
<p>The mass-circulation Hurriyet daily quoted Ridvan Budak, chairmen of the leftist union DISK, as saying civilians must now follow the lead of the soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Turkish armed forces have done their duty, now it is the task of civilian authority...The regime is in danger,&quot; Budak said.</p>
<p>Already the leaders of Turkey's two social democratic parties have spurned Erbakan, publically dismissing his charges that the armed forces had acted out of turn.</p>
<p>&quot;In a way he is challenging the state. He looks like he is rebelling against some of the rules of the democratic system,&quot; Bulent Ecevit, head of the Democratic Left Party and a former prime minister, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ecevit's rival for the leadership of the left, Deniz Baykal of the Republican People's Party, was more direct: &quot;The government should either conform to the constitution or step down.&quot;</p>
