<headline>Malaysia, Indonesia discuss Malacca Strait bridge.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-10-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysia and Indonesia on Monday discussed the idea of building a bridge linking the two countries across the Strait of Malacca, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said.</p>
<p>Briefing reporters on a meeting between visiting Indonesian President Suharto and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Alatas said the two leaders agreed the proposed bridge was &quot;a good idea&quot; that should be discussed further.</p>
<p>&quot;For such a project, it is primarily the private sector that ought to come up with the capital and the two governments ought to further discuss this possibility,&quot; Alatas said.</p>
<p>The two leaders also expressed concern about increased ship traffic, particularly large oil tankers, and consequent pollution in the strategic strait, which links the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Indonesia is promoting an alternative route that would have ships -- particularly oil tankers bringing Middle East crude to Japan -- sail to the south of Sumatra and enter the South China Sea through the strait of Lombok between the islands of Bali and Lombok, Alatas said.</p>
<p>Malaysia is proposing a &quot;landbridge&quot; across its border with Thailand to cut tanker traffic in the Malacca Strait. Under the plan, oil would be transported from Malaysia's Paya Island at the head of the strait and taken by truck, train or pipeline to Thailand's port city of Songkhla on the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Alatas said Mahathir briefed Suharto about the plan.</p>
<p>The project would be among the first undertaken in the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle. The free-trade triangle, set up in 1993, links the northern part of Indonesia's Sumatra island, northwest Malaysia and southern Thailand.</p>
