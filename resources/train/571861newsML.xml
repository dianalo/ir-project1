<p>Central American leaders had little but photographs to show from their long-awaited summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Central Americans had badly wanted Clinton to promise to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), grouping the United States, Canada and Mexico, into their region and to relax immigration laws they deem harsh.</p>
<p>They got neither.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very disappointed that there was nothing of substance,&quot; local political analyst Jaime Darenblum told Reuters. &quot;The only announcement was that the U.S. is going to establish a police academy in the region. The rest was all rhetoric.&quot;</p>
<p>Costa Rica's most respected daily newspaper La Nacion commented that local business and political leaders had expressed &quot;a certain incredulity at the results of the summit&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The general impression was that it did not live up to expectations,&quot; the daily said.</p>
<p>It quoted former Costa Rican foreign minister Bernd Niehaus as saying that on the most important issue, trade, the meeting had &quot;brought nothing new&quot;.</p>
<p>Undaunted, host president Jose Maria Figueres of Costa Rica proclaimed the summit &quot;pathbreaking in the hemisphere&quot; and predicted it would be &quot;remembered by many generations&quot;.</p>
<p>Various editorials in the region's main newspapers had expressed fears beforehand that Thursday's summit might be little more than a giant photo-opportunity.</p>
<p>When the San Jose Declaration was published by the leaders amid much fanfare, its centrepiece turned out to be a series of pledges for more talk.</p>
<p>These included annual encounters between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Central American foreign ministers, a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and her counterparts here, &quot;dialogue at the highest levels&quot; on immigration, a meeting of labour ministers to discuss workers' rights and the creation of a new bureaucracy, the &quot;ministerial-level Trade and Investment Council&quot;.</p>
<p>The only hard agreement signed was an open skies deal to liberalise air travel between the countries -- unlikely, analysts said, to do much to alleviate the grinding poverty in which 70 percent of Central Americans live.</p>
<p>Even though economists say poverty is Central America's most pressing issue, the San Jose Declaration did not actually mention it. The nearest the declaration got was a commitment to &quot;continue making necessary social investments in order to improve the quality of life in our countries&quot;.</p>
<p>But the Central American leaders, sensing a rare opportunity to take the stage with the world's most powerful president, did not want to miss their chance of a fleeting moment of glory.</p>
<p>&quot;The new relationship we are beginning has profound significance,&quot; El Salvador president Armando Calderon Sol told a news conference. &quot;This has been a very special day with a lot of hope for Central Americans&quot;.</p>
<p>Reporters questioning the presidents at a summit news conference asked about what they termed the less-than-edifying results of the summit.</p>
<p>The presidents defended themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not, from my point of view, a vague commitment,&quot; said Clinton, referring to U.S. pledges to advance trade cooperation and move towards a free trade area covering all the Americas by 2005.</p>
<p>&quot;I know 2005 sounds like a long time away, especially if you're very young, but it's not so very long,&quot; he consoled the Central Americans.</p>
<p>Guatemalan president Alvaro Arzu made a stab at changing the impoverished area's image as a perennial beggar.</p>
<p>&quot;What we insist on demonstrating is that the Central American region is prepared to not just stretch out its hand to ask for support from (the Americans) -- which we are thankful for -- but our desire for a more permanent relationship as partners,&quot; Arzu said.</p>
