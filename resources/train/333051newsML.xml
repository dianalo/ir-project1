<p>Burma's military government said on Saturday that thousands of innocent students were suffering because of a group that instigated unrest last month and forced the universities to be closed abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;Students who wished to attend classes peacefully had to suffer as some institutions of higher learning had to be closed temporarily recently due to instigations,&quot; said a top official of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).</p>
<p>&quot;A group of students who do not want to see stability and development of the nation will always try to make bad schemes to cause instability in the nation,&quot; the SLORC's secretary two, Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, was quoated as saying by state media.</p>
<p>University students in Rangoon last month launched anti-government street protests to demand more freedom, but the government broke up the rallies.</p>
<p>The SLORC also detained and later released more than 800 student protestors, closed the universities indefinitely and sent students home to their provinces.</p>
<p>Tin Oo, who was speaking at a meeting to coordinate studies at the high school level, did not say if the government would reopen the universities.</p>
<p>But he urged parents, teachers and students to make efforts to peacefully pursue their education and deter attempts by an unidentified anti-government group to disrupt studies.</p>
