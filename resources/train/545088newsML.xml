<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-RBA confident of low inflation by vigilance.</title>
<headline>RTRS-RBA confident of low inflation by vigilance.</headline>

<p>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) deputy governor Stephen Grenville said he was confident inflation would remain low, but it was not dead, and good monetary policy remained the key to price stability.</p>
<p>&quot;...inflation has not been vanquished definitively, so that it can never recur,&quot; said Grenville, speaking at a conference on Forecasting the Australian Economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am confident that inflation will stay down, but only through the continuing vigilance of the monetary authorities,&quot; he said, adding that the most difficult test remained ahead in the shape of an inevitable supply-side shock.  </p>
<p>Grenville said a more competitive environment would help keep inflation down, but that did not mean the economy could grow faster in a macro-economic sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Does this mean the economy can grow faster in an overall macro sense? Probably not: overall, macro supply constraints remain in place - you cannot just steam up demand without consequences,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the speech, titled &quot;The Death of Inflation?&quot;, Grenville set out a number of arguments for believing inflation would remain lower than in the 1970s and 1980s.  </p>
<p>These included greater international competition, rapid technical change, privatisation, the reduction of trade union power and increased price sensitivity among consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;...while a number of recent changes in the competitive environment will help keep inflation down, good monetary policy is still the key to price stability,&quot; said Grenville.</p>
<p>That in turn required a clear rule to guide and anchor policy, which for the RBA was the inflation target, introduced in 1993. Essentially this commits the bank to keeping average underlying inflation in a 2-3 percent band over the life of a business cycle.  </p>
<p>Grenville said it was necessary to keep reminding people of the benefits of price stability so that the inflation targets themselves were not the source of costly policy mistakes.</p>
<p>The targets were tested in 1994/95 when strong economic growth put pressure on prices, which the RBA successfully restrained with a tightening in monetary policy, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most difficult test still remains ahead of us, when we will, sooner or later, face a supply side shock,&quot; said Grenville. The costs of maintaining price stability would seem to be considerable and immediate, whereas the benefits would seem longer term, he said.  </p>
<p>Such a supply shock need not be as damaging as in the past, said Grenville.</p>
<p>&quot;In times of peace, prepare for war,&quot; he said. &quot;We should use the current period of price stability to establish a firm anchor of low price expectations, and build a strong perception on the part of the community that, while some variation in inflation is inevitable in the face of shocks, there will be a quick restoration of price stability.&quot;</p>
<p>One new element which might provide support for low inflation was the discipline provided by financial markets in a deregulated and internationally integrated economy, he said.  </p>
<p>One source of discipline was the floating of the Australian dollar which made it easier to insulate the economy from foreign inflationary shocks and more able to cope with cyclical shocks.</p>
<p>However, the loss of the fixed-rate anchor made it more imperative to have the inflation target as another anchor.</p>
<p>&quot;With the floating exchange rate and the increasing international integration, movements in the exchange rate (which sometimes reflect changing market sentiment, not based on fundamentals) can be a threat to inflation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Financial markets also helped to counter inflationary threats by driving market interest rates higher, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;To the extent this sensitivity is reflected in downward pressure on the exchange rate, it will encourage a tightening of policy to counter the inflationary consequences - the mere threat of inflation can, in some circumstances, trigger a policy response,&quot; said Grenville.</p>
<p>&quot;This discipline certainly exists, but its importance could easily be exaggerated,&quot; he added. &quot;When markets are overly sensitive to inflation threats, policy makers will make their own judgments on what should be done.</p>
<p>Figures last week showed the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in the March quarter to be 1.3 percent higher over the year. Underlying inflation rose 0.4 percent in the quarter to be 2.1 percent higher over the past 12 months.</p>
