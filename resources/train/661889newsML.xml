<p>French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Saturday that reaching agreement with Germany at an EU summit in Amsterdam would be hard but progress was being made.</p>
<p>&quot;The Germans have understood they must make a step forward if they want things to advance and we have to do the same,&quot; he told reporters as he emerged from a meeting of French Socialist leaders in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;Mutual concessions are the very definition of co-operation between two countries. I have the impression things are moving -- it's difficult, but things are moving and I hope we will reach agreement in Amsterdam,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn was answering questions about a Franco-German summit in Poitiers, western France, which failed on Friday to resolve differences on a single currency.</p>
<p>Conservative President Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were due to hold talks from 6.00 p.m. (1600 GMT) to discuss further steps, with Europe now facing an uphill task to strike a deal on an EU stability pact in time for the summit in Amsterdam on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jospin said in Poitiers the new government was committed to a single currency but wanted a fundamentally new approach to monetary union.</p>
<p>Demands for a focus on growth and jobs must be given the same importance as the stability pact limiting budget deficits after the launch of a single currency, he said.</p>
<p>Aides quoted Jospin as having told the Socialist meeting in Paris, mostly devoted to domestic issues, that he would not accept a simple &quot;social addendum&quot; to the stability treaty.</p>
<p>Jospin told the meeting he believed he was speaking for other European peoples and not only for his own, when he said growth, development, employment and the fight against inequality should have equal footing as a priority with monetary stability in the pact.</p>
<p>Socialist first secretary Francois Hollande told reporters Jospin wanted the EU to revive a project it had approved, but never acted upon, to create hundreds of thousands of jobs across western Europe by launching major public works projects, especially connected with transport.</p>
<p>The plan, adoped at a summit in Essen, Germany, in 1994 included new EU-financed highways and high-speed railway lines.</p>
<p>France's new government, swept to power in an upset parliamentary election victory on June 1, raised its objections to the pact at an international meeting for the first time on Monday.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Poitiers there would be intensive talks among European officials this weekend to try to strike a deal but French officials declined to give details and said reporters would not be allowed at the presidency for the Chirac-Jospin meeting.</p>
<p>Both France and Germany were keen to avoid any suggestion of a rift between Paris and Bonn, whose alliance is seen as crucial to pushing monetary union through in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We observed that our views are very largely similar and wherever this is not the case a solution can easily be found,&quot; Chirac said on Friday.</p>
<p>But a French source said Chirac, forced by his centre-right coalition's defeat to share power with a left-wing government, told German Chancellor Helmut Kohl the French election campaign had raised expectations which could make it harder to meet Maastricht treaty criteria on a single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The president presented the new situation in France, where things were said in the campaign and expectations were created that may be an additional complicating factor in achieving the criteria,&quot; the source said.</p>
