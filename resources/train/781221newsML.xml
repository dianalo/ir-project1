<p>A Palestinian arrested last week on suspicion of plotting the suicide bombing of a New York subway station, lived in Canada for more than a year and became a common criminal well known to Toronto police, authorities confirmed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, who was one of two Palestinians shot and captured by New York police in a pre-dawn raid on a Brooklyn tenement last week, tangled with Toronto police on at least five occasions when he lived in Canada's biggest city between February 1994 and May 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;He was well known to Metro (Toronto) police. We had a number of dealings with him between 1994 and 1995, and he was also known to use a number of different aliases,&quot; said police spokesman Devin Kealey.</p>
<p>Abu Mezer, 23, who left the West Bank in 1993, was first arrested by Toronto police on May 29, 1994 for credit card fraud and assault with intent to resist arrest, according to court records obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>He was convicted in an Ontario court and sentenced to a year's probation.</p>
<p>Less than five months later, while stil on probation, the Palestinian was charged with the sexual assault of a woman in an elevator. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of assault, was convicted and sentenced to more probation. Never during his stay in Canada did he serve jail time.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing to suggest that he was violent or anything of that nature. He was soft-spoken and spoke decently without offense to anyone,&quot; Spiros Nicolokakos, a lawyer who represented Abu Mezer in two criminal cases in Canada, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>U.S. officials believe Abu Mezer later gravitated to British Columbia where he became known to law enforcement officials in neighboring Washington state.</p>
<p>Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper quoted U.S. authorities as saying that Abu Mezer was arrested three times by U.S. border authorities in the past year and a half for illegally crossing into Washington state.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, he was ordered deported back to Canada, but Canadian officials refused to take him because of his past criminal record and his illegal entry to the United States.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Canadian Immigration Department said privacy laws prevented the government from releasing any information about Abu Mezer's case. But he noted that Canadian citizens can never be refused entry back into Canada.</p>
<p>Despite denials by Abu Mezer and relatives of any connection to militant Islamic organizations, the case has focused international attention on Canada's refugee and immigration policies.</p>
<p>Canada accepts a relatively high number of refugees, including those from other Western countries.</p>
<p>Just two months ago, Canadian officials were forced to consider holding a refugee hearing for a Saudi suspect wanted for questioning by the U.S. authorities about the 1996 truck bombing that killed 19 U.S. servicemen in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The suspect, Hani Abdel-Rahim Hussein al-Sayegh, was pinpointed by U.S. authorities as the driver of a car that gave the go-ahead signal for the bomb attack on Khobar Towers in Dhahran in Eastern Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>He was eventually deported to Saudi Arabia and arrested by local authorities in Riyadh.</p>
