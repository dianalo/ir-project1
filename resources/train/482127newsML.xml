<p>NationsBank Corp has filed with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for permission to form direct operating subsidiaries that would engage in real estate development and the financing of real estate leasing.</p>
<p>The filings were made March 26 by NationsBank, the lead bank of the holding company NationsBank Corp of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for NationsBank Wednesday confirmed that the applications had been submitted but declined to discuss them further.  </p>
<p>Under new OCC rules, national bank units can seek approval to engage in businesses which their holding cmopany parents are barred from entering.</p>
<p>The application to set up the real estate development operating subsidiary states that the unit would engage in the development of real estate in locations that NationsBank already occupies through the maintenance of bank premises.</p>
<p>The application said NationsBank is considering development of a $13 million building in Charlotte which would house about 45 residential condominium units.  </p>
<p>NationsBank is now constructing an office building on the site for use as a bank premises.  NationsBank said future projects would be limited in number and confined to areas adjacent to or near NationsBank premises.</p>
<p>NationsBank said the subsidiary would be physically separate and distinct from the bank, and this would be clearly stated in marketing materials and in contact with third parties.</p>
<p>The application to engage in real estate lease financing said the business would be conducted on a nationwide basis.  </p>
<p>The subsidary would acquire real porperty in connection with a proposed leasing transaction and would not acquire property in anticipation of leasing at a later date, the application said.</p>
<p>NationsBank said the leasing subsidiary would be organized as a corporation or a limited liabilty company with NationsBank N.A. the sole shareholder.  NationsBank N.A. would be insulated from unlimited liabilty for the actions of the subsidiary, the application said.</p>
