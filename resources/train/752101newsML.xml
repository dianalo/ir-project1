<title>ZIMBABWE: ZIMBABWE MONEY RATES STABLE IN LIQUID MARKET.</title>
<headline>ZIMBABWE MONEY RATES STABLE IN LIQUID MARKET.</headline>

<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted stable in continued liquidity on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said while speculation was rife on the contents of a national budget to be announced later in the day by finance minister Herbert Murerwa, the market had not reacted in any way to the talk.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we'll only see any possible reaction in the long-term,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, analysts said they expected the government to come into the local money market with a stock issue to help finance the 18-month budget, but added that it would probably seek to keep its borrowings to a minimum for fear antagonising Western backers of its economic reform programme who have called on it to reduce spending.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the market opened Z$102 million up and, forecasting another surplus at the end of the day from a number of maturities, the central Rerserve bank auctioned Z$200 million 91-day treasury bills to mop up some of the liquidity at a discount rate of 24.85 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank paper was also being sold on the secondary market 24.80 percent and call money was also quoted stable at 23 percent.					    </p>
<p>NCDs with maturity of 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought at 26.5 and sold at 26.25 while bankers acceptances were at 25.5 percent (buying) and 25 percent on the selling side.</p>
