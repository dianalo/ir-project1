<p>British supermarket chain ASDA Group plc said on Thursday that it was introducing &quot;fashion police&quot; to target people who pay too much for clothes as a promotion for its own-brand &quot;George&quot; range.</p>
<p>ASDA said anyone stopped would be issued with a &quot;fine&quot; in the form of a voucher offering 10 percent discount on George clothing purchases.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether their clothes are poor value or in poor taste, anyone 'cautioned' can use the voucher to make their next George purchase even better value,&quot; a statement from the company said.</p>
<p>ASDA, known for its cheeky and innovative approach to supermarket retailing, said it was also setting up a telephone helpline for fashion victims or anyone who wanted to inform on one as &quot;Britain's worst dresser.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ASDA's fashion police will hit the streets of Britain next week, showing zero tolerance for anyone wearing expensive brands, sad socks or grotty ties,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>George is ASDA's own-brand clothing range, set up with George Davis who worked with the Next fashion store chain.</p>
<p>ASDA said George clothing was around 20 percent cheaper than that of its competitors.</p>
<p>ASDA said George sales were up 32 percent in the year ending May 3 as it reported pretax profits before exceptional items up 16 percent to 353.7 million pounds ($588.1 million) with a total dividend of 3.05 pence per share, up from 2.65 pence.</p>
