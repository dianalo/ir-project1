<p>Jim Courier fought off a gallant challenge from Gustavo Kuerten to give the United States an unbeatable 3-1 lead over Brazil in their world group first round Davis Cup tie on Sunday.</p>
<p>Courier's 6-3 6-2 5-7 7-6 (13-11) win over Kuerten, a player more than 60 places below him in the world rankings, in the reverse singles finally settled a tie which had all the necessary ingredients for an upset.</p>
<p>The North Americans' inexperienced team had to contend with a partisan crowd and oppressive conditions against opponents who, although fielding a weak team on paper, had not lost a Davis Cup tie at home for 10 years.</p>
<p>The United States had taken a 2-0 lead on Friday but Brazil fought their way back into the tie on Saturday when unrated Jaime Oncins and Kuerten scored a stunning straight sets win over Alex O'Brien and Richey Reneberg.</p>
<p>Courier initially appeared to be heading for an easy win, especially when he won eight games in a row early on, a run which allowed him to win the first set and take a 4-0 lead in the second.</p>
<p>Kuerten had nothing to offer at the start, his sluggishness around the court suggesting he had just come from a large bowl of feijoada, a heavy local stew.</p>
<p>Even the usually boisterous crowd was strangly mute while the informal band that normally plays a quick samba between points turned up half an hour after the start. By then Courier was already on top as he took the first two sets.</p>
<p>But the 20-year-old fought back superbly to break  Courier's serve in the 12th game and take the third set 7-5.</p>
<p>With the crowd awake again, Kuerten continued to confront Courier on equal terms in the fourth set, both men playing from the back of the court.</p>
<p>Long, often tedious rallies resulted as both players held their service but the lack of variety was offset by some high drama in the shape of the tie-break which ultimately decided the match.</p>
<p>Kuerten heroically saved four match points, Courier twice volleying into the net, and also held two points to level the rubber at two sets each.</p>
<p>But the American, who needed treatment for dehydration afterwards, finally wrapped up the tie at the fifth attempt.</p>
