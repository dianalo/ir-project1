<p>President Clinton and Congressional leaders agreed to launch a joint task force of administration, Capitol Hill and District of Columbia leaders to seek solutions to D.C.'s mounting education, crime and taxpayer flight problems, Hill leaders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott announced the plan at a press briefing following a meeting between Clinton and bipartisan Congressional leaders on top government priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;The President said why don't you and the Speaker indicate a couple of point people from your operation and meet with us and representatives of D.C.,&quot; said Lott, R-Miss.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't say let's do this tax proposal or that spending measure or this crime action,&quot; Lott said. &quot;We said it's serious and we need to focus on it, we need to set up a process.&quot;</p>
<p>Gingrich, R-Ga.,  said, &quot;I thought (Clinton's) proposal today that we put together a joint executive-legislative tax force, that we work together in a quiet way, and that we take seriously how do we get to measurable improvement in the quality of life of young people (in D.C.)...is very positive.&quot;</p>
<p>Lott said he knows that some members of Congress oppose an infusion of funds for the District.</p>
<p>&quot;Some will say, wait, we're not going to do that in D.C. if we're not going to do that in my cities,&quot; Lott said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our argument is this is the nation's capital. There is a crisis here,&quot; Lott said. &quot;We ought to try somthing -- maybe even experiment. If it works here, maybe we can take it to the rest of the country, state by state.&quot;</p>
<p>Gingrich said, &quot;There's a definable, doable challenge and one that the rest of the country can draw strength from and learn from.&quot;</p>
<p>Lott said Hill leaders and the President did not discuss specific solutions.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) we believe there are some things we can agree on,&quot; he said. He noted that he and Gingrich support a controversial proposal by D.C.'s delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, for a D.C. flat tax.</p>
<p>Lott said he and Gingrich are &quot;very concerned&quot; about D.C. crime and how D.C.'s children are &quot;locked into&quot; unworkable schools.</p>
<p>Lott said he met with D.C. Mayor Marion Barry on Monday and Barry wanted to know what Congress can do about mounting crime. &quot;I said, Mr. Mayor, anything, something, everything. We have got to deal with these problems,&quot; Lott said.</p>
<p>Gingrich said Hill leaderse and Clinton did not discuss if the death penalty should be imposed in D.C. &quot;I don't think we are in a position to comment on that.&quot;</p>
