<p>Portugal's main farmers' group may appeal to the government soon to release an emergency fund to help cereals growers in the southeast who are battling a drought, a spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are studying the matter closely and may decide to ask the government to activate the 'calamities fund',&quot; Castro e Brito, vice-president of the Confederation of Portuguese Farmers (CAP), told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said rainfall levels had been very low over the past three months in Portugal and that it had not rained at all in March for the first time in more than a century.</p>
<p>Local media reports said farmers in the Alentejo, who produce most of Portugal's wheat and barley, had already lost much cereals production.</p>
<p>Castro e Brito estimated that the region's farmers could have lost tens of millions of escudos in revenues already this year due to rain shortages.</p>
<p>Augusto Vilela, spokesman of the Agriculture Ministry, acknowledged that there had been a worrying shortage of rain in the Alentejo, but said the government did not consider that the situation warranted disbursing the so-called 'calamities fund.'</p>
<p>&quot;There is no calamity at present, but the situation is serious and we are following it on a daily basis,&quot; Vilela told Reuters. &quot;If the lack of rainfall continues for another month or two, then that would be (a calamity),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Socialist government has control over the 'calamities fund', financed by insurance premiums paid by farmers, Castro e Brito said. Officials did not give the value of the fund.</p>
<p>Farmers in the Alentejo are battling against the increasing desertification of their land, officials said.</p>
<p>A few small dams in the region were not enough to satisfy the farmers' needs for water, Castro e Brito said.</p>
<p>The Alqueva dam being built in the Alentejo, which will have the biggest capacity in Europe encompassing 4,150 million cubic metres, will not be completed until 2001.</p>
<p>The European Commission is expected to release at least 50 billion escudos ($293 million) soon for the construction of the dam, Aderito Vicente Serrao, head of EDIA, the state company overseeing the project, told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>The 100 billion escudo ($586 million) dam, which will use water from the River Guadiana flowing from Spain, depends on Portuguese and European Union (EU) financing.</p>
<p>&quot;The dam will enable water to be distributed more efficiently in a region often hit by drought,&quot; Serrao said.</p>
