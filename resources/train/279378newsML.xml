<p>Bulgaria completed privatisation deals worth 95.93 billion levs for 509 enterprises in 1996 and plans to concentrate on fewer, higher-value deals in 1997, the privatisation agency said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Of the total 1996 privatisation income, 41 billion levs represented direct payments, and 46.7 billion was companies' debt which was taken on by buyers, the agency's director Vesselin Blagoev told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Bulgaria badly needs income from privatisation to meet payments on its $10 billion foreign debt. Central bank reserves declined to $525 million at end-November from $1.408 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The deals were carried out both by the agency and by government ministries and committees. A total of 309 deals were concluded in 1995.</p>
<p>Blagoev said the buyers had agreed to invest more than 30 billion levs in privatised companies. &quot;This sum is vitally important for our economy as it is clear that the state cannot afford to invest that in domestic production,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He said a tender procedure for the sale of a 60 percent stake in chemical firm Chimco would be opened in mid-January.</p>
<p>On December 19, Belgian chemicals company Solvay SA said it had signed a preliminary agreement with the privatisation agency allowing it to acquire 60 percent of soda ash producer Sodi for $160 million.</p>
<p>The main deal expected next year is the sale of a 25 percent stake in Bulgarian Telecommunications Company to an international operator.</p>
<p>The government has shortlisted six banks of those who applied to advise it on the deal and has said it will make its choice by the end of January.</p>
