<headline>Closing overseas stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 share index clawed back most of its early losses but failed to climb into positive territory, suffering its fourth fall in a row with a modest drop of 3.3 points, or 0.07 percent, to 4,653.7.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX index rose to within a whisker of the magic 3,800-point level in late trading Wednesday, with renewed record gains driven by derivatives and with few fundamental reasons for the advance. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,749.27, up 19.00 points, or 0.51 percent. In later screen-based trading, the IBIS DAX index ended at 3,777.56, up 47.00 points, or 1.26 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares finished down but well above their lows after Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin outlined his government's programme to parliament. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,739.69, down 12.05 points, or 0.44 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss stocks jumped 2 percent, driven by massive gains in index heavyweight Novartis and derivatives-linked buying. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended above 5,500 points for the first time, closing at 5,510.3, up 105.3 points, or 1.95 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks surged, with the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closing above the 14,500 mark on a strong rebound by property and bank stocks, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 14,506.49, up 302.60 points, or 2.13 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian stocks limped through early trade but recovered to reach full stride late in the day and end on their fifth record close in a week. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,693.3, up 19.9 points, or 0.74 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold shares tumbled to new lows as renewed woes from the international bullion price launched a fresh assault on the already bombed-out index, dealers said. The All-Share index closed at 7,209.1, down 9.0 points, or 0.12 percent. The All-Gold index closed at 1,061.3, down 35.4 points, or 0.02 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 8,433.8, up 1.9 points, or 3.23 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended flat in the Thursday session as most investors retreated to the sidelines ahead of the G7 summit, which starts later this week, brokers said. They added that bargain hunting was particularly brisk, preventing the Nikkei average from falling too heavily. The Nikkei 225 ended 10 points higher, or 0.05 percent,  at 20,507.85.</p>
