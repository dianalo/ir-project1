<p>Eurotunnel Plc, the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator said on Thursday it had finally reached agreement with its banks on restructuring its nine billion stg in debt and said the board had reviewed the timetable, which will be outlined in a separate statement due later.</p>
<p>The statement form the joint chairman Patrick Ponsolle and Robert Malpas, said &quot;The agreement which has been reached with representatives of the banks on a restructuring plans and which is going to be presented for approval (to shareholders) is, in the board's view, the best possible compromise under present circumstances.&quot;  </p>
<p>The deal ensures the &quot;finanical stability of the company for the six years to come,&quot; said the co-chairmen, allowing Eurotunnel to focus on improving its performance.</p>
<p>Shareholders will have the opportunity to keep a right to 54.5 percent of the long term potential profits.</p>
<p>The company has continued to argue the case for an extension of its franchise to run the tunnel, pressing the French and British governments. It said it would inform shareholders in due course about the outcome of the talks which have been ongoing since October.</p>
