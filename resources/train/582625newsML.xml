<p>The House blocked debate Wednesday on an emergency spending bill providing $8.4 billion for weather-ravaged states and U.S. military operations as lawmakers rebelled over a host of contentious add-ons.</p>
<p>In a setback for Republican leaders, the House voted 193-229 against a rule to open debate on the aid bill, which has been mired in partisan bickering over issues great and small. More than 40 Republicans voted against the proposal.</p>
<p>After scrambling throughout the afternoon, House leaders decided on a host of changes that appeared to improve the prospects for passing the bill Thursday.</p>
<p>They dropped an amendment that would have cut off funding for U.S. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia after June 30, 1998. The bill provides nearly $2 billion for these activities and continued U.S. military flights in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The White House had threatened a veto if the amendment passed. Democrats generally opposed the cutoff, and Republicans were divided on the issue.</p>
<p>Republicans also backed off an amendment that would have cut aid to Russia to help fund U.S. Bosnia operations.</p>
<p>Settling a regional spat that helped bring down the rule, House leaders agreed on partial protection for a provision in the spending bill that would give more companies a chance to supply paper for U.S. currency. One firm in Massachusetts is now the sole provider of paper.</p>
<p>House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas and other lawmakers representing areas that want the contract rebelled Thursday morning when it appeared bidding would remain closed.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to write a new rule, come back tomorrow, bring this up and pass it,&quot; DeLay, one of the Republicans who voted no, said.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders had hoped for quick passage of the emergency legislation, which would provide $5.5 billion to aid more than 30 states struggling to recover from severe storms and flooding. But it has become a magnet for a host of special-interest provisions in both the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Despite the changes, the House bill still faces some tough battles.</p>
<p>The House will vote on an amendment to continue federal programmes automatically if the White House and Congress do not pass needed spending bills. President Clinton has threatened to veto the Senate measure, because it contains the automatic authority.</p>
<p>Disputes over spending forced two government shutdowns in fiscal 1996, and polls show the public blames the shutdowns on Republicans. Supporters of the plan say it is simply a good government insurance policy to prevent future closures.</p>
<p>The White House says it would take the pressure off lawmakers and provides a lower level of spending than Republicans have promised for Clinton's domestic priorities.</p>
<p>There may also be dissension over an amendment to increase funding for a special nutrition programme for poor pregnant women and poor children.</p>
<p>Some Republicans voted no Wednesday because House leaders agreed to double the money allocated in the bill for the Women, Infants and Children programme, providing the full $76 million the White House requested.</p>
<p>On the other side, Democrats, only 13 of whom voted for the rule, were angry, because they felt their party was not getting credit for securing the extra money. The White House has said hundreds of thousands of children will lose aid without additional funding.</p>
<p>The deal calls for the House to debate a bipartisan amendment.</p>
