<headline>CRICKET-Vettori praised, but patience urged.</headline>
<text>
<p>CHRISTCHURCH, Feb 18 - Patience. That's the key for gifted young spin bowler Daniel Vettori as he comes to terms with his sudden rise to fame in the New Zealand cricket team, according to former test spinner Stephen Boock.</p>
<p>Left arm spinner Vettori took two for 33 in 23 overs in England's second innings yesterday afternoon on the penultimate day of the third test against the Kiwis.</p>
<p>Today he appeared the key figure for New Zealand as they chased a series-levelling victory in the final match of the rubber.  </p>
<p>England were 118 for two at stumps last night, requiring 305 to win on the final day.</p>
<p>Vettori, who turned 18 last month, is in just his fourth first-class match and after an encouraging two-wicket return on his debut in the second test at Wellington last week, Vettori picked up one for 13 in 12 overs in England's first innings at Lancaster Park.</p>
<p>Boock, who took 74 wickets in 30 tests with his left arm spin between 1978 and 1989, is delighted by Vettori's success.</p>
<p>&quot;It's amazing, brilliant to watch,&quot; Boock told NZPA last night.  </p>
<p>&quot;He does things naturally that a lot of other people take a long time to learn.</p>
<p>&quot;Where a lot of other young guys struggle, things like run up, action and technique, he's found them very early.</p>
<p>&quot;He's obviously got a good head for it and he is listening to people.&quot;</p>
<p>But Boock said it would be wrong for the cricket public, or New Zealand's selectors, to expect Vettori to be winning tests with his career still in its infancy.  </p>
<p>&quot;Richard Hadlee didn't turn up like this joker and it's expecting a lot to think he's going to come along and be different.</p>
<p>&quot;He must be patient. While he might have an old head on young shoulders, there's a huge amount of learning to do,&quot; Boock added.</p>
<p>Young spin bowlers are making their mark in international cricket.  </p>
<p>South Africa have unorthodox left armer Paul Adams, Zimbabwe's Paul Strang is an influential figure in their side, while Pakistan have recently thrown up 16-year-old legspinner Shahid Afridi and 20-year-old offspinner Saqlain Mushtaq.</p>
<p>Australian Shane Warne, Mushtaq Ahmed of Pakistan and India's Anil Kumble are scarcely at the veteran stage either.</p>
<p>New Zealand tried to introduce 21-year-old legspinner Greg Loveridge last year, but a broken finger prevented him bowling on his debut against Zimbabwe.  </p>
<p>Boock believes Vettori has benefited from making his early test appearances against England, whose batsmen tend to play from the crease, rather than advance down the pitch.</p>
<p>Boock felt batsmen from countries like the West Indies or Pakistan would take a different approach towards the teenager.</p>
<p>&quot;They would be prepared to sacrifice three wickets to put him out of the test side.</p>
<p>&quot;He will learn without being knocked out of the park.&quot;</p>
<p>Boock's only criticism was that Vettori didn't have support from veteran offspinner Dipak Patel during the third test.  </p>
<p>And he hoped Vettori wouldn't be left to carry the burden in his next few tests.</p>
<p>Vettori had to bowl 34.3 overs during England's only innings in the second test at Wellington and was the key figure in New Zealand's push for victory in the third test.</p>
<p>&quot;But he really has got it. He's got a lovely action, he's got machine-like qualities, repeated precisely. He doesn't have variables in his action and he's got some arm ball -- that's a weapon and a half.</p>
<p>&quot;He could be very, very good,&quot; Boock added.  </p>
<p>Vettori's cricketing education was enhanced by his effort yesterday against two classy batsmen in England captain Mike Atherton and senior player Alec Stewart.</p>
<p>Atherton batted expertly, coping with Vettori's demanding line and length and the amount of lift he got out of the footmarks, to be 65 not out at stumps.</p>
<p>Stewart had all manner of problems, being struck in the head by one lifter from Vettori, and was eventually caught at short leg after labouring 108 balls over 17.</p>
