<p>Commodity groups, which reached their pinnacle of power with OPEC over 20 years ago, are losing influence under the battering of free market forces and may not survive, Singapore-based analysts and traders say.</p>
<p>&quot;I think these commodity organisations are becoming extinct,&quot; the managing director of an oilseeds company told Reuters late last week. &quot;A lot of the time, the market just ignores them. I don't think anybody follows them any more.&quot;</p>
<p>A grains trader in Singapore the groups were an experiment of the 1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;Third World countries looked at OPEC and saw how successful it was initially,&quot; he said. &quot;But we now live in a free market. There's no free ride any more.&quot;</p>
<p>Commodity groups wielded power in the 1970s when OPEC, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, imposed an oil embargo against the West for its support for Israel in its wars against Arab nations.</p>
<p>The embargo sent prices of oil and crude products soaring, hurting the economies of industrialised countries and pumping billions of dollars into the coffers of countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Nigeria and Indonesia.</p>
<p>That clout was shown again when oil prices hit a peak of more than $40 a barrel in 1979 after the fall of the Shah of Iran.</p>
<p>From cocoa to coffee to tin, commodity groups linking producing countries sprang up to impose export quotas in a bid to boost prices.</p>
<p>Things have changed.</p>
<p>In the current standoff between the United States and Iraq, oil prices have hit a post-Gulf War high of $25 a barrel. But those prices, when adjusted for inflation, are not much higher than the prices of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Announcements from ministers attending commodity conferences on coffee used to move world markets. Now reports from these meetings produce yawns from traders.</p>
<p>One analyst said the influence of commodity groups began to fall apart when they started losing market share as trade liberalisation gained ground and consumers switched to alternative products.</p>
<p>&quot;Commodities are so replaceable,&quot; the analyst said. &quot;The world has gone back to market mechanisms.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest group threatened with irrelevance is the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC), whose ministers meet in Singapore on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>The group includes Australia, Bolivia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Zaire, and also Brazil, which has observer status, but its ranks are thinning rapidly.</p>
<p>Thailand said it would withdraw from October 1, Australia is to pull out on December 10 and Zaire, which now produces almost no tin, has stopped attending ATPC meetings.</p>
<p>Sensing the the group's weakness, Brazil said it would delay full entry because membership would now be &quot;useless&quot;.</p>
<p>With the roll of members effectively down to five countries, traders said this raised the prospect of the collapse of a group that imposed quotas on its members who then ignored them.</p>
<p>&quot;All these commodity organisations and pacts are falling by the wayside. Trading is increasingly in the hands of the private sector and prices are increasingly determined by supply-demand considerations,&quot; a senior Western grains analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even OPEC's effectiveness is open to question,&quot; another dealer said. &quot;I think these groups are fading away. They can't really survive much longer.&quot;</p>
