<p>Gold prices rebounded sharply on Friday as speculators anticipated a possible move by &quot;hot&quot; money into bullion if comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan unnerve Wall Street.</p>
<p>Gold advanced, first in the Far East and then in Europe, as stocks and bonds slipped after Greenspan said on Thursday that the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets.</p>
<p>Short covering continued into early European gold business.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything that upsets calm in the financial markets is good for gold but gold was going up anyway before Greenspan spoke,&quot; said bullion analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;The key thing for gold will be how Wall Street interprets his comments. By the time (New York) opens, they may seem a bit less dramatic than they were seen in the Far East,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $373.00 per ounce up from $369.00 on Thursday as the market continued to pull away from a three-year low fixing of $367.40 plumbed on Tuesday. Gold has been as low as $366 spot trading this week. &quot;If the Dow is down this afternoon that will be quite bullish for gold. The market is pretty illiquid on the upside,&quot; said one bullion dealer.</p>
<p>Some indication of UK equity market thinking came from the FTSE100 stock index being down 75 points at the gold fixing in anticipation of New York moving lower.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm surprised that the reaction has been quite so strong. All Greenspan was doing was repeating what people have been saying for weeks about the sheer height of the stock markets,&quot; said analyst Tony Warwick-Ching at research group CTU International.</p>
<p>Gold prices have been under pressure for several weeks from rumours of central banks selling gold and a daily dribble of metal on to the market by producers trying to protect themselves against falling prices.</p>
<p>UBS's Smith backgrounded the overnight price surge, &quot;Gold shares have been bubbling and currencies are so volatile that one day producers are buying and the next selling. On top of that we have had short covering in an oversold market.&quot;</p>
<p>The other precious metals had mixed reactions. Silver followed gold higher before running into selling at $4.92 and settling around $4.88/$4.90, up six cents.</p>
<p>Platinum slipped to a discount to gold at $371.50/$372.50 down 55 cents. Dealers said a long position being unwound was pressuring platinum. Palladium was $0.25 cents lower at $115.50/$116.50.</p>
