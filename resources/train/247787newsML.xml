<p>South Korea on Tuesday announced a major rise in defence spending for five years starting in 1998, aimed mainly at increasing investment in early warning systems and intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry statement said the 1998-2002 military budget would be 100.8 trillion won ($120.7 billion), representing a 12.9 percent rise in spending for each of the five years.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget will be spent over the five years starting in 1998 to improve the nation's defence capabilities,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>In September, the South Korean cabinet approved defence spending of 14.27 trillion won in 1997, up 12 percent from this year's budget of 12.74 trillion.</p>
<p>Defence, which makes up 21.2 percent of the nation's total budget of 60.11 trillion won this year, is the biggest single spending item in South Korea, which is still technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;The defence programme for 1998-2002 is aimed at maintaining peace by deterring wars with North Korea and neighbouring countries,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The infiltration of a North Korean submarine into South Korean waters in September has renewed nationwide concerns about North Korea's military intentions.</p>
<p>In a bid to head off similar incidents in future, the ministry said it would increase investment in improving early warning systems and information gathering capabilities.</p>
<p>On Monday, it said 20 South Korean military personnel faced disciplinary action over the intrusion of the submarine which exposed gaping security holes.</p>
<p>A review of the submarine incident had exposed blind spots in South Korea's coastal defences and showed that a radar system to pick up submarine movements was inadequate, the statement said.</p>
