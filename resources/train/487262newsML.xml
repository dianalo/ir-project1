<p>Russian air freight forwarders called on customs authorities on Friday to revoke new rules that have caused a backlog of millions of dollars worth of imported cargo in Moscow since they were imposed last month.</p>
<p>The forwarders said however they could not provide more detailed estimates of the cost of the backlog at this stage.</p>
<p>&quot;The air cargo market may be destroyed,&quot; Boris Panchenko, senior cargo manager at forwarding firm Eruslan said, unless a new rule forcing importers to pay duties on arrival at Moscow rather than at their final destination, was scrapped.</p>
<p>&quot;The new regime for transit cargo through Moscow has frozen many air cargo contracts,&quot; Igor Mordvinov, senior sales manager of Burlington Air Express Moscow, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged: &quot;It is not clear that the customs will scrap these rules or change them soon.&quot;</p>
<p>A State Customs Committee spokesman said the authorities had changed the rules because cargo arriving at Moscow was &quot;disappearing&quot; en route to provincial destinations, leaving duty unpaid. &quot;We had big losses,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The result for the forwarders, however, was that many clients had simply halted transit shipments through Moscow, said Nikolai Belyayev, sales manager of EMS Garant Post, a forwarder for Air France, KLM and ANA Cargo.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that cargo volume has dropped in the last two weeks,&quot; he said, adding that the new rule was &quot;illogical&quot; and should be scrapped. The forwarders had seen significant loss of business since it was introduced on March 20, he said.</p>
<p>Panchenko, at Eruslan, said the customs rule had forced client importers from the Russian provinces to travel in person to the capital to clear their cargo through customs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a big problem because it's costing them time and money,&quot; he said. Clients were looking for alternative routes to ship cargo avoiding Moscow. &quot;But this is not easy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Not everyone is complaining, however.</p>
<p>Panchenko said the rules ought to prove profitable for Western airlines which operated direct cargo and passenger flights from western Europe to provincial Russian destinations.</p>
<p>&quot;Lufthansa and other Western carriers are in favour now,&quot; Panchenko said. Lufthansa serves a number of major cities in central Russia and Siberia from Germany.</p>
