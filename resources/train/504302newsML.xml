<title>VIETNAM: Vietnam coffee trade at trickle as stocks dwindle.</title>
<headline>Vietnam coffee trade at trickle as stocks dwindle.</headline>
<dateline>HANOI 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Vietnam's robusta coffee market was at a near standstill on Friday as the end of the 1996/97 season approached and as buyers turned towards Indonesia, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam is running out of coffee,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The prices in Indonesia are becoming more attractive and the buyers are shifting away from Vietnam towards Indonesia.&quot;</p>
<p>Little activity was reported but traders and merchants said buyers were bidding around $1,300-1,320 per tonne FOB Saigon Port and sellers were looking for prices of up to $1,350-1,370.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices in the outside market are lower than the internal level&quot;, a trader said. &quot;...and prices in London are unlikely to go up.&quot;</p>
<p>Vietnam has exported an estimated 220,000 tonnes of coffee so far from its 1996/97 crop, which was harvested in October and November. Remaining stocks were estimated at no more than 30,000-40,000 tonnes.</p>
