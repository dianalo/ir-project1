<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistan Muslim Commercial Bank cuts lending rate.</title>

<p>The private Muslim Commercial Bank said on Tuesday it has decided to cut the interest charged on loans for its customers by 1.09 percent effective from July 1, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The reduction in mark-up (interest) rates will only be applicable for all our regular customers who are paying marck-up over 17 percent,&quot; an MCB statement said.</p>
<p>The statement said the reduction in lending rates was made possible by MCB's &quot;exellent all-round performance&quot; and due to measures announced by the government.</p>
<p>The State (central) Bank of Pakistan last month slashed its key discount or three-day repo (repurchase contract) rate by one percent to 19 percent to help bring down the overall ineterst rate structure and enable the corporate sector to borrow at lower rates.</p>
<p>The SBP repo rate, last changed on October 22, determines the interest charged by the central bank on amounts provided as temporary funding facility to commercial banks that fail to sqaure their positions in the overnight inter-bank money market.</p>
<p>The cut in the repo rate followed similar moves announced earlier aimed at lowering the cost of borrowing and allowing more liquidity to flow into the system.</p>
<p>The central bank earlier in June slashed the statutory liuidity reserve (SLR), required by banks to maintain with the central bank, to 20 percent of their total time and demand deposits from 25 percent to increase credit flow to the private sector.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz in his budget speech on June 13 withdrew a one percent excise duty on bank loans saying this would bring interest rates down by 1.7 percent.</p>
<p>Lending rates for the corporate sector averaged around 17.5 percent but most industrial and commercial borrowers were paying rates from 20 to 22 percent.</p>
<p>MCB said its initiative to reduce the lending rate by 1.09 percent alongwith the withdrawal of one percent excise duty by the government will have a total impact of 2.21 percent cut in the cost of borrowing for its customers.</p>
<p>It said a central bank scheme for recovery of loans has helped it recover 550 million rupees and a total of 1.5 billion rupees are likely to be recovered in 1997.</p>
