<p>Sri Lanka on Monday welcomed the swearing in of India's Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and called him an old friend who had worked hard to improve relations.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Gujral is a sincere and tested friend of Sri Lanka, who understands this country well,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;He has even in the worst of times, as was in 1989, been able to steer Indo-Sri Lanka relations out of trouble. We have no doubt that the solid foundation he has helped lay as foreign minister will be further consolidated now that he is the prime minister of India.&quot;</p>
<p>Indo-Sri Lanka relations touched a low in the late 1980s after Indian troops arrived in the island to try to disarm rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tiger Eelam (LTTE) under a controversial agreement between the two countries.</p>
<p>The troops were withdrawn in mid-1990 after suffering heavy casualties and failing to defeat the rebels. Gujral was then foreign minister of India.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan newspapers said on Monday that Gujral would be able to reduce regional tension by forging closer ties with Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>The Observer said in a front-page editorial that Gujral was a firm believer in defusing tensions with neighbours and was keen on &quot;nurturing trust and confidence&quot;.</p>
<p>Gujral visited Colombo in January, during his second stint as foreign minister, and said India was ready to do anything to help bring the island's 13-year-old ethnic conflict to an end.</p>
<p>He also promised to lift trade barriers to help increase Sri Lankan exports to its huge neighbour as part of what is now known in diplomatic circles as the &quot;Gujral Doctrine&quot;.</p>
<p>This holds that as the largest nation in South Asia, India can afford to offer concessions to its neighbours in the interests of regional harmony.</p>
