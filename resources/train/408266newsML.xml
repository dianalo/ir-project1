<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Thursday slammed Israel's decision to build housing for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem saying it was a violation of Israeli-PLO peace moves.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big breaching to what had been agreed upon and it is against the United Nations resolutions and also against the American letter of guarantees and against all the agreements that had been signed,&quot; Arafat told reporters upon arriving in Nablus from Gaza for a visit.</p>
<p>Israel enraged Palestinians on Wednesday when a ministerial committee approved plans to build 6,500 housing units on Jabal Abu Ghneim, known by Israelis as Har Homa, in East Jerusalem on land captured by the Jewish state along with the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Palestinians view the neighborhood, that completes a ring of Jewish apartment blocks around Jerusalem, as an attempt to block the possiblity of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said on Thursday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had an unwritten agreement with Arafat that Israel would increase the size of its next pullout from the West Bank in exchange for a promise to contain Palestinian reaction to the Har Homa plan.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's spokesman denied the report saying: &quot;There is no connection between building in Jerusalem and the scope of the next deployments in the West Bank.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen also denied the report and said: &quot;I do not believe that any Palestinian would indulge in such an operation...The agreement is in fact between the United States and Israel and not between Palestinians and Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>Under a 1993 peace deal that launched limited Palestinian self-rule in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel agreed to discuss the future of Jerusalem during talks on a permanent peace settlement. The talks, which began last year, are due to resume next month.</p>
<p>Israel handed over most of the West Bank town of Hebron in January and agreed to carry out three stages of further redeployments by mid-1998.</p>
<p>The leftist Israeli party Meretz applied to Israel's High Court of Justice on Thursday to issue an injunction against the building on the grounds it violated the principle of equality between Arabs and Jews, a court spokesman said.</p>
<p>A court official who spoke on condition he was not named said: &quot;I don't think they will build until the court rules on the Meretz request.&quot; No date had been set for a hearing.</p>
<p>An Israeli who owned some of the Har Homa land until it was confiscated for the project is also waiting for a court ruling on his petition against the building.</p>
<p>Arafat, described by aides as being &quot;very concerned&quot; over the future of Israeli-PLO peace moves, summoned the top Palestinian leadership for a meeting to discuss the Israeli decision.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian leadership has an expanded meeting today including the (Palestine Liberation Organisation) Executive Committee and the ministerial council as well as other leaders,&quot; said Abu Medeen.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say that there is no peace process. There is one side dictating to the other and this is the case of Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israel's decision to build some 2,500 homes for Jews in the first stage came despite international protests and warnings that the plan could ignite a fresh round of Israeli-Palestinian violence.</p>
<p>Sixty one Palestinians and 15 Israelis died in gunbattles that erupted across the West Bank and Gaza Strip in September after Israel opened a tourist tunnel near Islamic holy shrines in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, trying to blunt possible Palestinian protests and international anger, said the committee also approved the construction of 3,000 housing units for Arabs elsewhere in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israel would not tolerate any violence.</p>
<p>&quot;If we're challenged violently we'll have to respond and we'll respond very firmly, but I hope it doesn't come to that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Palestinians planned to march against the settlement from the West Bank town of Beit Sahour to the hill later on Thursday. Israel has bolstered its military presence in the West Bank to quell any possible violence.</p>
