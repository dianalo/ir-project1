<p>The Electricity Market Company (EMCO) on Wednesday said it was disappointed that Comalco Power NZ Ltd, a unit of Comalco New Zealand, had decided to resign from the New Zealand Electricity Market (NZEM).</p>
<p>However, EMCO said it did not expect Comalco's decision to open a floodgate of further resignations from NZEM.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Comalco) are an important and large consumer of electricity and we asked them to be part of the market design process because of that,&quot; EMCO spokesman Kieran Murray told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;So we're disappointed that they've chosen not to stay with the market that's been designed by the industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Comalco Power NZ Ltd said it had resigned because the market rules were structured so that electricity suppliers could dominate decisions.</p>
<p>&quot;Regrettably, as the consitutional arrangements of the market provide no effective opportunity for the purchasing or consumer side to influence outcomes, Comalco has no other option but to resign,&quot; Comalco said in a statment.  </p>
<p>Comalco is New Zealand's largest electricity consumer, using around 15 percent of the total electricity generated. Managing director Kerry McDonald said Comaclo would not have been a direct player in the market but the price it pays for power is largely determined by the average costs of power.</p>
<p>&quot;Our major concern is that if the market is inefficient and increases costs, then the cost of electricity goes up along with the cost to every other consumer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>EMCO said it did not expect an exodus of players away from the new wholesale market, which becomes fully operational on October 1, as a result of Comalco's move.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't expect them to be the last resignation from NZEM, nor would we expect not to see any new entrants come in,&quot; Murray said.</p>
<p>He described NZEM as a &quot;watershed&quot; in that it was a movement away from the old government-led industry to a fresh approach based on industry consensus and competition.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it's natural in such an environment for companies to assess their need for a direct involvement in the wholesale market.  </p>
<p>&quot;We can expect a variety of commercial arrangements to emerge. New companies will enter the market, TransAlta is a local example. Some existing players may choose to pull out of the market, others will chose to purchase through specialist trading companies. Most have indicated that they intend to take an active part in the market,&quot; Murray said.</p>
<p>He said Comalco would not have been a large player in the new market.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a large consumer of electricity, it would not have been a large player in the market because its energy purchase needs are tied up in delivered energy contracts with ECNZ (Electricity Corporation of New Zealand). It would not have been participating in the market in a large way.&quot;</p>
<p>McDonald said the way EMCO was organised and the way it made decisions gave no ability for a consumer such as Comalco to affect the outcome.</p>
<p>&quot;The voting structure is completely dominated by the supply side of the industry,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>A rebalancing of the voting structure would be an important first step to improving the market, he said.</p>
