<title>SINGAPORE: ASIA FUEL OIL - FIRM ON FRESH BUYING SUPPORT.</title>
<headline>ASIA FUEL OIL - FIRM ON FRESH BUYING SUPPORT.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-08-13</dateline>

<p>The Singapore high sulphur fuel oil market edged up on Wednesday as a new buyer emerged on the physical market amid rising swap values, traders said.</p>
<p>The Dutch trader is the third buyer to emerge this week for fuel oil amid tight supplies.</p>
<p>Over the past week, a Singapore trader and a Middle East trader have bought 20,000-tonne cargoes at $103.50 and $102.50 per tonne, respectively, on a free-on-board basis.</p>
<p>The Dutch trader's bid at $103.50 on Wednesday failed to entice any selling interest as supplies in Singapore, especially for prompt lifting are tight.  </p>
<p>The tightness was clearly reflected in the bunker market where supplies for lifting over the next few days are priced at up to $5.00 per tonne above the usual products that are sold for delivery 7-10 days out.</p>
<p>Bunker prices have also risen in tandem with the stronger cargo prices with 380-cst for delivery in a week's time sold at $107.00 and 180-cst for similar timing sold at $110.50, bunker suppliers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest physical buying has spooked the market and everyone's buying because they think the market is going to be bidded up over the next few days,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>September fuel oil was last quoted at $104.00/$105.00 per tonne, up from Tuesday's $103.50/$104.50, brokers said. It traded earlier in the day at $104.25 and $104.50 compared to Tuesday's traded intra-day high of $103.75, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said the latest price increase was due to the emergence of more than one buyer in the physical market with more buyers seen in the swaps market.</p>
<p>Swaps buyers included Chinese trading companies, Japanese trading houses and Singapore traders, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Buying from Chinese traders in the swaps market for September and October lots has also fuelled speculation that China will re-enter the market to buy physical cargoes.</p>
<p>China is currently bidding for physical cargoes at about $7.50-$8.00 per tonne above Singapore spot prices on a cost-and-freight south China basis.</p>
