<p>Russia insisted on Saturday it had won a good deal at the summit with the United States, hailing it as a breakthrough and denying charges it had been outflanked on NATO enlargement or bought off by the West.</p>
<p>Asked at a news conference in Helsinki whether Russia's bargaining position with the Western alliance had been weakened, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said:</p>
<p>&quot;Russia stands by its negative position on NATO enlargement, and the agreement which we want to sign with NATO is not a pay-off for giving up that position.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What happened yesterday was a real breakthrough,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed at the two-day summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton to sign a charter building a new relationship with NATO, despite Moscow's continued opposition to the eastward expansion of the alliance.</p>
<p>Yeltsin dropped a key Russian demand that the charter should be legally binding and also promised to minimise differences with the West over NATO enlargement, drawing charges from communist opponents in the Russian parliament (Duma) that Moscow had caved in to shameful defeat.</p>
<p>Both sides were careful to portray the summit as an even-handed affair with compromises on both sides, although Clinton made none on the NATO issue.</p>
<p>The summit agreement on NATO, Primakov said, would &quot;make it more helpful for us to move towards signing the appropriate agreements&quot;. Decisions reached in Helsinki &quot;coincide to a great degree with requirements voiced in the Duma&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>Clinton, who arrived home early on Saturday, and Yeltsin did give their post-Cold War partnership a boost with a range of agreements covering issues from Russia's economic place on the world stage to a pledge of further cuts in nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Although they publicly agreed to differ on NATO enlargement, Yeltsin appeared to have made concessions which enraged his hardline critics at home but delighted the Western alliance and former Soviet bloc states which are now clamouring to join.</p>
<p>Poland, expected to be among several former Soviet bloc states invited to start membership talks at a summit of the 16-nation alliance in July, said the Helsinki agreement meant that Russia had accepted NATO enlargement would go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who was to fly back to Moscow later on Saturday after meeting Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, nevertheless stuck to his public line that Moscow views NATO enlargement as a mistake and as a threat to Russia's security.</p>
<p>The meeting was dubbed the &quot;summit of the invalids&quot;, with Clinton confined to a wheelchair following a leg injury and Yeltsin still recovering from heart surgery and illness. Clinton flew home on Friday, while Yeltsin was staying until Saturday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin had to avoid looking weak in front of his communist and nationalist critics at home, while Clinton wanted to stress the West's real intention of a partnership with Russia.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, the Kremlin blasted NATO enlargement as a threat to Russia's security and suggested there could be a major row at the summit.</p>
<p>In Moscow, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Friday Russia had been dealt a &quot;crushing defeat&quot;, comparable to the 1919 Versailles Treaty which imposed humiliating conditions on Germany at the end of World War One.</p>
<p>Western analysts also saw Yeltsin as the loser.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an equitable result...you have to worry about the endurance and stability of a result that is not equitable,&quot; said John Steinbruner at Washington's Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>Alexander Rahr of the German Foreign Policy Association, said the summit signalled an overwhelming victory for Clinton.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia has given up its massive resistance to NATO's eastward expansion. It's a big victory for Clinton, but Yeltsin will have trouble selling the summit as a success to the military and political elite at home,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, Yeltsin and Clinton did resolve a dispute over missile defences at their summit and held out the prospect of more talks on cutting their long-range nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>On economic matters, Clinton promised to try to get Russia into key global economic groupings such as the World Trade Organisation. Yeltsin promised to reform Russia's creaking tax regime and to crack down on corruption and organised crime.</p>
