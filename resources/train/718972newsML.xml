<p>A hardline Bosnian Serb police chief implicated in ethnic cleansing was killed in a clash with NATO-led peacekeeping troops trying to arrest him on war crimes charges, the independent B-92 radio station said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The report, quoting an international police source, said Simo Drljaca was killed in the northwestern town of Prijedor early on Thursday and that a companion with him also died.</p>
<p>An eyewitness told Bosnian Serb police that Drljaca was confronted in a fish restaurant and was shot in the chest when he tried to resist arrest.</p>
<p>According to Bosnian Serb television, Prijedor hospital director Mico Kovacevic was detained during the operation in a sector for which British troops are responsible.</p>
<p>NATO sources in Sarajevo confirmed a Bosnian government report that an operation to detain war criminals was under way in Bosnian Serb territory but refused to give details.</p>
<p>Drljaca became notorious as Prijedor police chief at the start of the Bosnian war in 1992 when he led Serb paramilitary gangs who drove local Croats and Moslems from their homes at gunpoint.</p>
<p>He was also involved in the setting up of detention camps in the Prijedor area where Moslems were tortured and killed.</p>
<p>NATO demanded his dismissal last year after he and his men threatened peacekeeping troops with banned weapons while waging a campaign of obstruction against the peace process.</p>
