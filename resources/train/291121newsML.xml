<p>U.S. wholesale prices are expected to show only modest increases for the month of December, though rising energy prices could pose an inflationary threat down the road, economists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Experts surveyed by Reuters are calling for a 0.3 percent overall gain in the December Producer Price Index, due from the Labor Department at 0830 EST/1330 GMT on Thursday, January 9.</p>
<p>The core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to post a reassuring 0.1 percent rise for December.  </p>
<p>&quot;Energy prices will be up in December but only by a small amount,&quot; said Christopher Low, senior economist at HSBC Markets Inc, noting that a decline in November crude oil prices could filter through to depressed gasoline prices in the December report.</p>
<p>&quot;But next month will be worse,&quot; he added. &quot;People are beginning to realize that the energy price increases we've seen recently are not going to go away.&quot;</p>
<p>Forecasts for colder weather in the Northeast have pushed energy prices sharply higher of late, with heating oil leading the way.  </p>
<p>And although the heating and crude oil price run took a breather on Tuesday, analysts said sentiment remains bullish.</p>
<p>Low is predicting a modest 0.2 percent rise in both the overall and core producer price rates for December, but sees reason for concern on the energy front going forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Even with reassuring numbers there's a very subtle shift taking place,&quot; he said. &quot;I think people will begin discussing the threat of pipeline inflationary pressures within a few months.&quot;  </p>
<p>David Sloan, senior economist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. Inc, agreed that energy price gains were becoming &quot;something of a worry,&quot; but foresaw little reason for concern about the December figures.</p>
<p>He expects a 0.1 percent increase in the headline and core producer price rates and predicts a continuation of last month's slight fall in food prices.</p>
<p>In November producer prices rose 0.4 percent overall and by 0.1 percent excluding food and energy prices.  </p>
<p>In the finished goods category, gasoline prices rose by 2.8 percent in November, while passenger car prices gained at a 0.5 percent pace. Heating oil and tobacco products were the only decliners in the category.</p>
<p>In crude goods, energy materials prices including crude petroleum gained at a 7.7 percent pace in November, while crude petroleum prices declined by 4.6 percent.</p>
