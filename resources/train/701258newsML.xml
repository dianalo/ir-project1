<title>UK: NWE gas oil spreads stable, diesel actively talked.</title>
<headline>NWE gas oil spreads stable, diesel actively talked.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>European spot gas oil differentials were stable on Wednesday, with discussion focused on a firm low sulphur diesel cargo market, traders said.</p>
<p>July IPE gas oil futures ended 25 cents adrift at $167.50 a tonne, recovering from earlier losses as crude dealers sought cover ahead of a long weekend.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel cargoes traded twice at July IPE +$5.50 basis Amsterdam and +$6.50 basis Le Havre for first half July delivery, around unchanged.</p>
<p>One trader said the spread appeared vulnerable to short-term volatility due to a contest between Scandinavian and French majors but solid demand meant underlying firmness was likely to persist.</p>
<p>German DIN heating oil remains assessed at around July IPE +$3.25 cif NWE for first decade July. Second decade is talked at Aug IPE +$4.50/$5.50 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Barges were quiet, with dollar strength and holidays crimping demand. Refinery grade heating oil was done at July IPE +$0.50, unchanged. Storage material was 50 cents to $1 cheaper.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel barges continue discussed at firm levels around at July IPE +$5/6 fob Rotterdam.</p>
