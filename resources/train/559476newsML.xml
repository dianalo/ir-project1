<headline>Colombian stocks up led by banks.</headline>
<text>
<p>BOGOTA, May 5 Reuter - Colombian stocks edged up, led by Banco de Bogota and Banco de Colombia, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bogota's IBB index closed up 1.23 percent at 1,152.98 on volume of 1.4 billion pesos, while Medellin's IBOMED general price index gained 0.22 percent to close at 17,497.13 on 4.6 billion peso volume.</p>
<p>&quot;There is liquidity in the markets and demand for credit is still low so I think the stock markets are benefiting quite a lot. A decision on interest rates would also help,&quot; said Carlos Caballero, head of the Bogota exchange.  </p>
<p>The biggest gainer of the day was Banco de Bogota, head of the Santo Domingo conglomerate, which bounced back 13.39 percent to 6,630 in Bogota after a 10 percent fall Friday. It was up 1.07 percent in Medellin at 6,640.</p>
<p>Banco de Colombia, meanwhile, was up 1.55 percent at 392 in Bogota and up 1.82 percent to the same price in Medellin.</p>
<p>The stock is moving up again after falling to 374 last week on news it broke off plans for a partnership with Spain's Banco Central Hispano Americano after it indicated that it was not content to become a strategic partner, but wanted to assume joint administrative control.  </p>
<p>Demand for stocks in the powerful Sindicato Antioqueno conglomerate centered on cement maker Cemento Argos, up 0.19 percent sy 8,800 in Bogota and up a wafer- thin 0.02 percent at 8,802 in Medellin.</p>
<p>In Medellin insurance company Suramericana de Seguros, also part of the Sindicato, was up 0.03 percent to 26,557, while supermarket chain Almacenes Exito gained 0.09 percent to close at 3,453.</p>
<p>Another supermarket chain, Carulla gained 1.36 percent to 3,801 in Bogota. In a statement earlier in the day, stock broker Suramericana de Valores forecast Carulla's net profits would grow 37.2 percent to about 7.4 billion pesos this year.</p>
