<p>COMMENT - Trading started the week on a fairly active note and then picked up steam when it became clear there was no Canadian &quot;wall of wood&quot; waiting to cross the border at the start of a new quota shipments year on April 1, Random Lengths said. Prices slanted upward, with momentum gaining toward week's end.  </p>
<p>Apart from a nasty snowstorm in the Northeast, improving weather across the country boosted outbound shipments from dealer yards. Many buyers expressed surprise, and a little frustration, with how quickly mills cleaned up floor stock and extended order files to mid-April or beyond. While dealers stuck mostly to highly specified truckload purchases, wholesalers and distributors showed more willingness to own wood.</p>
<p>Secondaries who took small long positions turned them fairly quickly as some dealers scrambled to cover needs they had delayed purchasing earlier. The need for stock put a premium on prompt shipments, favoring distribution yards and reloads.  </p>
<p>With their own sales on the upswing, treaters were more willing to replace stock that moved out of their yards, Random Lengths said. Drier weather quieted talk about log shortages in the South, but some traders in the region noted the prospect of truck shortages as produce shipments pick up.</p>
<p>With field inventories low and delayed building projects getting back on track, producers were upbeat about the near term. Double-digit price gains were fairly common in dimension items, with the Random Lengths Framing Composite index ending $9 higher. The leader in many species was #2&amp;btr 2x10. But board markets were mostly quiet as buyers awaited a price correction.</p>
<p>Western Red Cedar prices held but buyers saw more offerings.</p>
<p>Canadian annual April/March fee-free quota exports used as of March 26 were 98.8 percent, Random Lengths said.</p>
