<p>White sugar futures weakened slightly in more active afternoon trading on Monday but the main focus of attention was on the remaining time before the July raws expiry in New York.</p>
<p>A mixed bag of players, including brokerages, commission and trade houses, moved into the London market after the New York open. Earlier activity on the whites had been lacklustre, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just bits and bobs...nobody's really taking it by the scruff of the neck, it's just routine trading,&quot; said one market source.</p>
<p>The nearby August/October spread widened further and is expected to stay supported at around $5.00 due to talk of untenderable sugars hedged against August. The spread traded at $2.50 at its narrowest point last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I would think you'll see the August/October having a rally at some stage,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>At 1605 GMT August was down 30 cents at $321.00 and October down by the same amount at $315.30. Volume amounted to 1,469 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said there was little interest in the August/July arbitrage although October/October was attracting more interest at between $68 and $69.</p>
<p>A relatively hefty physical delivery is expected against July raws, with some traders anticipating as much as 200,000 long tons of mainly Brazilian sugars.</p>
<p>In Paris, August dominated the session with 549 out of a total 625 lots traded. August was down $1.10 at $319.50 and October down 10 cents at $315.10.</p>
<p>On the 100 ICUMSA market nearby October was down 50 cents at $291.00. Volume totalled 90 lots.</p>
