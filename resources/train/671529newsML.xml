<p>The United States and Japan are near agreement on a new format for deregulation talks, which could be announced by President Clinton and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto later this week, a U.S. official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that will probably happen. I think the odds are pretty good,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Some details of the agreement still need to be worked out before Hashimoto and Clinton meet on Thursday in Denver ahead of a weekend meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven rich industrial nations, the official said.  </p>
<p>Hashimoto and Clinton had agreed in April during a meeting in Washington on the need to intensify discussions between the two economic powers on Japan's deregulation.</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to have government working groups focus on deregulation of housing, telecommunications, medical devices and pharmaceuticals and financial services. Another group will focus on competition policy and transparency of government practices, the official said.</p>
<p>The groups are to report their progress periodically to higher level officials, he said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are anxious to see that as Japan deregulates its economy, new opportunities are opened up for U.S. products and services. The official said Washington wants to be sure there is a way to address its concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;Up until now on deregulation we have been working within a domestic Japanese process ... and we want to focus on this more from a bilateral perspective, so we are not just feeding into a domestic process but that we have our own forum to raise these issues,&quot; the official said.</p>
