<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard has said he will seek U.S. President Bill Clinton's support for maintaining pressure for world trade liberalisation in talks between the two leaders this week.</p>
<p>But Howard, in a series of newspaper interviews published on Monday, declined to say if he would also raise trade disputes between Australia and the United States at the one-hour meeting in Canberra on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Clinton is due to arrive in Australia on Tuesday on the first leg of a 12-day Asian tour, his first overseas tour since being re-elected earlier this month.</p>
<p>It is also his first visit to Australia, a key U.S. ally in the region whose new conservative government has pledged to reinvigorate ties with Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing I will be putting to him -- I think it will fall on very fertile ground -- is that we need to keep up the momentum towards trade liberalisation,&quot; Howard told the Australian Financial Review newspaper.</p>
<p>The Clinton-Howard talks come ahead of next week's summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum leaders, which will discuss the group's pact to axe trade barriers by 2020.</p>
<p>Progress under trade reforms agreed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will also be discussed at the first ministerial meeting of GATT's successor, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Singapore next month.</p>
<p>Senior Australian officials have expressed concern that some nations may be backing away from their trade liberalisation commitments.</p>
<p>Howard stressed his Liberal-National coalition government was committed to cutting trade barriers, but said he would also push for benefits from other countries in return.</p>
<p>He would not comment about U.S. actions over Australian assistance for the textile and car industries, saying trade disputes &quot;are relatively small compared with the overall benefits of the relationship&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be canvassing issues of joint concern to us both ... and obviously issues of particular concern to Australia,&quot; Howard told the Review.</p>
<p>Washington has complained to the WTO about Australian government assistance for the car industry and the clothing, textile and footwear industry.</p>
<p>Howard's cabinet was expected to discuss the issue on MOnday. But he said the government was committed to maintaining a viable domestic car industry.</p>
<p>&quot;This is obviously one of the things we will have to grapple with as we move along,&quot; he said, adding it would be &quot;unthinkable&quot; to abandon the industry.</p>
<p>Australia has long been critical of U.S. government assistance to exporters, particularly in the agricultrual sector, and U.S. import restrictions.</p>
<p>Australian ferry builders are currently locked out of the lucrative U.S. market by an import ban on foreign-made ferries.</p>
<p>Clinton is due to arrive in Australia on Tuesday. He will visit Sydney, Canberra and the resort town of Port Douglas, in Queensland state, before leaving for Manila on Saturday.</p>
