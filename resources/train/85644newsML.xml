<title>USA: Revco sues to block Big B poison pill.</title>
<headline>Revco sues to block Big B poison pill.</headline>
<dateline>TWINSBURG, Ohio</dateline>
<text>
<p>Revco D.S. Inc. said Monday it filed suit in U.S. District Court seeking to block an anti-takeover plan enacted by drug store chain, Big B Inc., which has rejected Revco's $332 million takeover offer.</p>
<p>Big B last week spurned Revco's offer of $15 per share and adopted a &quot;poison pill&quot; plan to be triggered if an individual or group acquired 10 percent of the regional drugstore chain.</p>
<p>Revco also said it wants to sign a confidentiality agreement with Bessemer, Ala.-based Big B, but rejected the terms for the pact that have been laid out by its target.</p>
<p>&quot;Big B is still asking Revco to execute the confidentiality agreement while its poison pill remains in place, unchallenged. This, among other provisions of the proposed agreement, simply deprives Big B's shareholders of the opportunity to receive prompt value for their shares,&quot; Revco Chief Executive Officer Dwayne Hoven said in a statement.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Birmingham, Ala., Revco contends that the poison pill violates Alabama law. It also contends that the provision discriminates against holders of 10 percent or more of its common stock.</p>
<p>Revco also said Hoven sent a letter Friday to Big B Chief Executive Officer Anthony Bruno in which Revco proposed changes in the terms of a potential confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We are willing to negotiate a reasonable confidentiality agreement that will allow us access to confidential information available to other bidders to ensure that your shareholders receive the highest value for their shares,&quot; Hoven wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>Revco said that it remained willing to discuss its acquisition offer with Big B and was disappointed that Big B adopted a poison pill.</p>
<p>Big B could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In rejecting Revco's offer, Big B last week said the bid was inadequate, but said that it would actively explore alternatives to maximize shareholder value.</p>
