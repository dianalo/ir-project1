<p>The South African seaport of Cape Town begins a four-day charm offensive on Friday in a bid to become the first African venue for the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>But while officials of the 2004 Olympic Bid Company prepared to welcome International Olympic Committee members on an evaluation tour, some citizens -- a minority, according to opinion polls -- remained unsure if they want the honour at all.</p>
<p>&quot;It's ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous,&quot; Cape Town businessman Mike Langdon said in an unofficial street poll. &quot;We are not prepared for it. Our transport system stinks and there is too much crime, far too much crime.&quot;</p>
<p>Ivan Williams, chairman of the Stop The 2004 Olympic Bid Forum, said it was far too soon for South Africa, barely three years into the transition from apartheid to democracy, to consider a project of Olympic scale.</p>
<p>&quot;There are certain priorities...such as housing, employment, health care, education and getting the crime rate under control. Once these are addressed, I think South Africa can have a relook at hosting the world for two weeks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 20-member IOC team was scheduled to visit proposed Olympic sites and to meet planners and likely beneficiaries of the Olympic investment South Africa hopes to woo.</p>
<p>They were also likely to confront anti-Olympic protesters trying to warn them off.</p>
<p>Veteran black activist Ngconde Balfour, now international director of the Olympic Bid, said organisers would not try to keep the IOC delegation away from protesters, but he insisted the Games offered the best chance to kick-start the regional and national economies.</p>
<p>&quot;For us, these games are not a prize, they are a tool of reconstruction and development. All we ask is that you give the Mother City a chance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Opponents of the event, for which a capital outlay is proposed equivalent to 7.3 billion rand ($1.6 billion) in 1996 terms, fear it will put profits in the pockets of big business and saddle Cape Town's rate-payers with a massive bill.</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela, possibly the city's strongest weapon in the fight against rivals including Rome, Stockholm, Athens and Rio de Janeiro, has publicly backed the project.</p>
<p>But he warned at a recent ceremony in Cape Town that the city would deserve national support only if it shared the benefits with the poor and integrated spending with his government's post-apartheid development programme.</p>
<p>&quot;The construction that is going to happen must be seen as part of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. There must be no white elephants,&quot; he warned.</p>
<p>Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the recently retired head of the Anglican Church in southern Africa and now head of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission trying to heal the wounds of white rule, has also backed the bid.</p>
<p>&quot;We have proved to ourselves and to the world that South Africa is a country where we can dream dreams and where those dreams actually come true,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tutu dismissed fears the Games would impose a burden on the city's mainly white rate-payers, saying: &quot;Let us not delude ourselves. There is no other prospective economic miracle that will stem South Africa's slide into poverty and despair.&quot;</p>
<p>A poll commissioned by South Africa's Independent Newspapers Group showed recently that 80 percent of the population favoured the bid.</p>
<p>An analysis of the figures appeared to confirm blacks, who stand to benefit most from the jobs that the Games could create, are more keen than whites.</p>
<p>Only 11 percent of Mandela's supporters opposed the bid while 56 percent of the mainly white Democratic Party's supporters were against it.</p>
<p>Political sources say Mandela's cabinet was deeply divided over the bid and the commitment required by the IOC to cover its costs and to contribute about 4 billion rand ($855 million) to the capital programme.</p>
<p>Under intense pressure from Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, the government eventually agreed to underwrite the games after the Development Bank of Southern Africa checked the bidder's figures and gave the green light.</p>
<p>The bank said that in 1996 terms, the event could inject more than 30 billion rand ($6.4 billion) into the economy between 1997 and 2006 and create more than 90,000 permanent jobs.</p>
<p>Williams remains unimpressed. He predicts thousands of the estimated 40 percent of the population that is unemployed will come to Cape Town and stay.</p>
<p>The houses that will be built for the media and athletes will be more suitable afterwards to middle class families than to the estimated 1.5 million people living in wood, tin and plastic shacks alongside the airport highway.</p>
<p>&quot;After the games, Cape Town is going to sit with a larger headache than ever,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Patricia Phillips, a city office worker, was more optimistic, telling Reuters in the street poll: &quot;I feel that Cape Town must get the bid -- we are going to get the bid. I think we are capable of handling the Games.&quot;</p>
