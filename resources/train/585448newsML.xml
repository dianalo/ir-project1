<p>WEYBRIDGE, England, May 15 - British Lions manager Fran Cotton has warned his players to behave themselves on the pitch during the forthcoming tour of South Africa.</p>
<p>Cotton, renowned as a hard man prone to the odd on-field confrontation during his playing days in the 1970s, said on Thursday that the 35-strong squad would be given a code of conduct.</p>
<p>&quot;The professional era demands higher standards and all the players will be made fully aware of what is required with their physical commitments being scrutinised by touch judges and TV replays.&quot;</p>
<p>Cotton said there would be &quot;a lot of talk about 1974&quot; -- a Lions' tour of South Africa marred by violence on the pitch -- but this time discipline &quot;would be fully under control&quot;.</p>
<p>The Lions manager confirmed he would be consulting South African referees about their interpretation of the rules.</p>
<p>Coach Ian McGeechan echoed Cotton's tough view on discipline and said modern-day players could not afford to be indisciplined.</p>
<p>&quot;If we play the way we want to we won't have time to think about anything else,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We must adapt to everything they throw at us -- referees, opposition, conditions. For eight weeks we become part of South Africa and we have to take on that mentality.&quot;</p>
<p>McGeechan acknowledged the tour would be made all the harder as the Springbok players were being drawn together after the Super 12 Series and may not even face the Lions in the provincial games.</p>
<p>&quot;They will literally be doing the same as we're doing. That's why those first two weeks of the tour are so important to us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Lions, who leave for South Africa on Saturday, play their first provincial match against an Eastern Province XV on May 24.</p>
