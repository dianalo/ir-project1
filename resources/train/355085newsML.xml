<p>Private housing starts in Britain reached their highest level in more than two years in the three months to December 1996, the Department of the Environment (DoE) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in private housing starts over recent months is linked to the continuing strong recovery in the wider housing market,&quot; Environment Minister James Clappison said in a statement.</p>
<p>Private starts rose seven percent on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with the previous three months, and were up 33 percent on the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>This was the highest level since late 1994, the DoE said, adding that the market's upward trend was likewly to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;Prospects of improved growth in real incomes and mortgage rates close to their lowest level for 30 years should help to improve consumer confidence and support a continuing broad recovery in the housing market,&quot; Clappison said.</p>
