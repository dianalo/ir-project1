<p>The United States warned Zairean rebels on Wednesday that they could be damaging future relations with Western powers by failing to repatriate Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;If the rebel alliance would like to have normal relations with Western governments, they've got to act in a credible way and a humanitarian way, and that doesn't seem to be the case right here,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>He told reporters the price for the rebels of not allowing the refugees to return home &quot;is going to be to their reputation and credibility, and how the rest of the world looks upon them. This is of course a test.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Wednesday he was &quot;shocked and appalled by the inhumanity&quot; of the followers of rebel leader Laurent Kabila in preventing aid from reaching up to 100,000 refugees.</p>
<p>The refugees near the city of Kisangani are believed to be the last of hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled into Zaire fearing retribution when a Tutsi-run government came to power in Rwanda in 1994.</p>
<p>In a statement, Burns called on the rebels to allow relief agencies immediate access to the refugees and to permit their U.S.-funded airlift to Rwanda. He said reports of recent mass killings of refugees &quot;are of grave concern.&quot;</p>
<p>Rebel leaders have cited security concerns about the refugees, some of whom are suspected of being members of Rwandan Hutu militias. But Burns said the rebels might at least let the women and children go.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebel alliance has to prove that it is responsible enough to handle a situation like this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Burns said the Rwandan government, which had until recently been blocking the return of the refugees, was now no longer doing so.</p>
<p>The Zairean rebels &quot;are responsible. There can be no further excuses for this,&quot; he said.</p>
