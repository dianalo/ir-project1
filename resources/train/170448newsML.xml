<p>U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich said Tuesday he saw no reason why the current five-year-plus economic expansion cannot continue for another four years.</p>
<p>He suggested that growth could be stronger than the Administration has conservatively forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;We ought to be able  to keep the economy going,&quot; Reich told Reuters Financial Television. &quot;I don't see why it (the expansion) can't continue (for another four more years).&quot;</p>
<p>He added that he saw no sign of an acceleration in inflation despite the economy's continued strong performance.  </p>
<p>Reich spoke from Clinton's headquarters in Little Rock amid mounting signs that the president was on his way to winning another four years in office.</p>
<p>The Labor Secretary  set out three economic policy priorities for a second Clinton term -- reducing the budget deficit, opening up foreign markets to U.S. exports, and investing in education and training.</p>
<p>He strongly denied that Clinton would back away from his pledge to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. &quot;I believe we are going to get there,&quot; Reich said in response to a question. &quot;It's good for the markets and it's good for America,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The administration has projected that the economy will grow by 2.3 percent next year and beyond. But Reich called that forecast &quot;very conservative. Maybe we can grow faster,&quot; he said. Much will depend on the growth of productivity.</p>
