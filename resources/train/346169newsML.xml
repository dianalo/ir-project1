<p>In a remarkable confession for a professional sportsman, New Zealand golfer Michael Campbell on Friday admitted to deliberately not trying in a European PGA Tour event last year.</p>
<p>Campbell said he lost his European card for 1997 because he missed some putts on purpose after a prolonged run of poor form left him in despair.</p>
<p>&quot;I missed out on my card by two or three thousand pounds. If I had made the cut when I purposely three-putted, I could have made my card for this year,&quot; said Campbell, speaking during the Heineken Classic tournament after shooting a second round 68 for a share of fourth place.</p>
<p>He said the low point in his despair came during a tournament in Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;I was missing cuts on purpose. I had a 20-foot putt on the last hole and I...three-putted on purpose (to miss the cut) because I didn't want to be there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very, very stupid of me to do that because I was chucking in the towel all the time. I feel that this year is going to be a very good one for me.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very pessimistic about my ability,&quot; said Campbell, who finished third in the 1995 British Open, the highlight of an outstanding season in Europe before a wrist injury led to a form slump.</p>
<p>Asked where the incident occured, Campbell said: &quot;My mind was so fogged up. I think it was somewhere in Spain, maybe the Spanish Open. I'm not quite sure.</p>
<p>&quot;I was probably going to give the game up and do something else, like work as a barman... deep down inside, I was pretty close to quitting.</p>
<p>Campbell said he took two months off to consider his future.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1995 life was so easy. Then you go through hard times like I did in '96.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly, it was my wrist. I had two months not practicing, came out with a new swing and it didn't work. When you are desperate, you listen to everybody's advice. I became so confused and had no idea of where the ball was going.</p>
<p>&quot;I was so wretched. Every time I was over the ball and hit a shot, I was stiff because I was thinking about my backswing, my posture, my alignment, my grip, my follow through, my stance, everything.</p>
<p>Director of Tour Operations for the European PGA Tour John Paramor described Campbell's actions as unfortunate and unprofessional.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first time in my 22 years on tour that I have heard anything like it. It is an unfortunate incident.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to speak to Michael at some stage just to find out what it is all about because I am interested.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unfortunate because it is an unprofessional thing to do. The professional approach is to always give your best whatever the circumstances and whatever your score.</p>
<p>&quot;Michael went through some pretty dire times last year and people do some very strange things when they are under stress like that.</p>
<p>&quot;His public scores were there for the record and you do notice when a player is fifth on the order of merit one year and then struggles badly the next.</p>
<p>&quot;I did start to wonder why this was happening to him but players do not usually share their personal turmoil with us,&quot; he said.</p>
