<p>British engineering group GKN Plc reported a 12.2 percent rise in half year pre-tax profits on Wednesday, but the strong pound took a larger-than-expected 18 million pounds ($29.3 million) bite into the profit-line.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 28 rose to 203 million pounds from 181 million last year, topping market forecasts of between 185 and 193 million pounds.</p>
<p>GKN said if last year's earnings had been calculated using current sterling exchange rates, the 1997 first half profits would have been up around 25 percent and sales by six percent.</p>
<p>&quot;All our major businesses delivered very strong performances in the first six months of 1997. This progress has been achieved despite the impact of currency translation rates,&quot; GKN chief executive, CK Chow said in a statement.</p>
<p>The soaring British currency, which has risen by around 30 percent since last summer, wiped 135 million off sales, leading to a turnover fallback of 2.3 percent to 1.68 billion.</p>
<p>Despite the pound remaining a dominant force in European currency markets, Chow said he &quot;felt confident that with the underlying strength of our businesses, 1997 should be another year of growth for GKN.&quot;</p>
<p>Chow said the balance sheet was strong, despite the cost of acquisitions and investments totalling 356 million pounds. Remaining cash balances placed the group in a good position to &quot;fund further strategic development,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Looking at a divisional breakdown of the results, automotive and agritechnical products made further progress through acquisitions, with sales at 1.02 billion and profits up five million to 106 million.</p>
<p>Aerospace and special vehicles saw sales of 460 million and profits of 51 million, with the Westland unit seeing profit growth across all divisions and the GKN Defence performing steadily.</p>
<p>Industrial Services saw sales of 208 million and profits of 42 million, with the Chep pallet unit performing well despite the currency difficulties in Europe.</p>
