<p>European debt markets peeled themselves off the floor late on Friday after weak U.S. jobs data counteracted earlier damage wrought by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, traders said.</p>
<p>But bonds remained weak and analysts said it would be hard to get back on the track of the rally that carried markets to heady heights just a few sessions ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets are really spooked,&quot; said Bill Westgate, vice-president at HSBC Securities in London. &quot;It will be hard to regain the confidence of a few days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Data showed the number of people joining the payroll in November rose by 118,000, lower than expectations for a 179,000 gain. October payrolls were revised up to 224,000 from 210,000.</p>
<p>November's unemployment rate also unexpectedly rose to 5.4 percent, compared with forecasts for a steady 5.2 percent rate.</p>
<p>At 1511 GMT, German March Bund futures on LIFFE were down 52 basis points at 100.18, up from 99.84 before the data.</p>
<p>Gilts were off 31/32 at 108-25 versus 108-16 before the U.S. numbers, Italian BTPs were down 131 basis points at 127.30 versus 126.55 and French December notionnel futures were 88 basis points lower at 128.34 compared with 128.00.</p>
<p>The Chicago Board of Trade's March T-bond future was down 9/32 at 113-26, up from 113-00 before the data.</p>
<p>In New York, the benchmark 30-year long bond also slashed overnight losses. At 1359 GMT, the long bond was at 99-20, yielding 6.528 percent, compared with 98-16 in a sour Tokyo session and 99-29 in New York on Thursday.</p>
<p>The spread between 10-year U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds moved in one point in favour of Treasuries to 53 basis points.</p>
<p>European markets had tumbled in early Europe after Treasuries sold off overnight on cautious comments from Greenspan.</p>
<p>Greenspan said late on Thursday that the Fed must be wary when &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; infects stock and other asset markets because that could end up damaging the economy.</p>
<p>He also said interest rate changes take time to feed into the economy, which meant the Fed often had to to tighten or ease before the need for action was evident to the public.</p>
<p>Though debt markets recovered some lost ground on the weaker-than-expected overall payroll number, Westgate said the rise in average hourly earnings was worrying.</p>
<p>November hourly earnings rose to $11.99 from $11.90 in October, increasing potential inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the jobs data) did have a sting in its tail with the rise in hourly earnings,&quot; Westgate said.</p>
<p>A futures broker at a U.S. bank in London agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;I would still be selling,&quot; he said. &quot;The headline figure was okay, but the average earnings were high. Things really don't look very good.&quot;</p>
<p>But Stuart Thomson, chief international economist at Nikko Securities in London, said the wage rise was not alarming in a larger context.</p>
<p>&quot;If one takes it over the last two months, it is still not excessive and still not an immediate concern to the Fed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also said the overall payroll figure was restrained by government and retail employment and was accompanied by a rise in the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that the Fed has been concerned with the tightness of the labour market, this will be a relief to the Fed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, because retailers were not expected to hire as many extra staff as usual to help with the Christmas rush this season, payrolls could show a rebound in January.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan's comments show the Fed at the margin will be more willing to respond to stronger economic growth by raising interest rates in order to help cool the stock market than they were earlier this year,&quot; Thomson said.</p>
