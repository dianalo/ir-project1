<p>Singapore's futures exchange is exploring opportunities for contracts based on regional stock indices following the positive performance of its Taiwan stock index contract, an exchange official said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the successful Taiwan contract, our members have suggested we look more closely at other contracts in the region,&quot; Ang Swee Tian, president of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) told Reuters.  </p>
<p>He said the exchange had not identified any particular stock market index for a futures contract, but was proceeding with previously announced plans for a contract based on the Business Times-Singapore Regional Index, launched last October.</p>
<p>Ang said SIMEX's Taiwan stock futures contract, based on the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) index, had performed well since its launch despite the absence of Taiwan players banned from trading offshore Taiwan index contracts.</p>
<p>He said the exchange was pleased to learn about recent moves by Taiwan authorities to legalise local trading of offshore Taiwan stock index futures.  </p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to working closely with the Taiwan SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)...to foster the growth of the futures market in Taiwan,&quot; Ang said.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Finance Ministry approved on Tuesday a proposal to legalise trading of offshore Taiwan stock index contracts listed on SIMEX and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and said it would submit the plan for cabinet approval soon.</p>
<p>SIMEX and the CME launched the contracts, based on the MSCI and Dow Jones Taiwan indices respectively, on January 9 against the objections of Taiwan regulators who wanted them to wait until Taipei opened its own futures market.  </p>
<p>While the expected entry of Taiwanese retail customers would boost liquidity in the SIMEX contract, Ang said its success did not depend on their participation.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we're concerned, international players and fund managers follow the MSCI Taiwan index. The international and regional market has to be our focus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the expansion of open interest in the contract indicated that international investors were increasingly using it to hedge on the volatile Taiwan stock market.</p>
<p>Volumes on the SIMEX Taiwan contract currently average about 2,000 lots daily, compared with just over 300 lots in January.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would be more comfortable if we're able to bring volume to about 5,000 lots a day,&quot; Ang said. Higher liquidity was likely to draw the interest of more international fund managers, he added.</p>
<p>Ang said the contract was also likely to see a rise in volumes once it received approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, opening the way for participation from U.S.-based funds.</p>
<p>Ang said increased competition between existing and new futures exchanges would benefit the industry as a whole by creating greater awareness and a wider menu of products.  </p>
<p>&quot;We realise more countries will have ambitions of playing a role beyond their own markets. So we have to make sure we remain competitive and cost effective,&quot; Ang said.</p>
