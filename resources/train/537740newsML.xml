<p>The Japanese economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery in calendar 1997 and grow at a pace of 2.2 percent, supported by an easy monetary policy and improving employment conditions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its world economic outlook.</p>
<p>The 2.2 percent forecast is a downward revision of 0.5 point from the IMF's previous projection released last October.</p>
<p>But it is above the Japanese government's target of 1.9 percent growth for fiscal 1997/98, which began on April 1. Japan does not issue growth targets for the calendar year.</p>
<p>Although the IMF said Japan's growth may turn out to be stronger than expected, it added that uncertainties remained about the impact of fiscal consolidation measures and the effects of strains in the financial system.</p>
<p>The government introduced a number of fiscal tightening measures from April 1. Notable among them was a rise in the sales tax to five percent from three percent. It also ended special income tax cuts.</p>
<p>The IMF said that due to the uncertainties, Japan needs to maintain an easy monetary policy until an autonomous recovery is firmly established.</p>
<p>It also said that growth in domestic demand has remained modest in Japan, with rises in corporate investment largely offset by small declines in private consumption and a drop in public spending.</p>
<p>In addition to fiscal and monetary policies, the IMF said a correction of the excessive appreciation of the yen from the spring of 1995 has supported Japan's recovery, and an increase in net exports is likely to sustain growth in 1997.</p>
