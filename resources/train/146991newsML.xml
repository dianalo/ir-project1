<p>Durakon Industries Inc said Monday its third quarter earnings per share rose 107 percent due to higher sales and significant cost reductions.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking ahead, new products and productivity improvements should continue to have a positive impact on sales and profits, but competition is intense and may offset some of our gains in productivity,&quot; David Wright, president, said.</p>
<p>Durakon, which makes pickup truck bedliners, rollback car-carrier and wheel-lift towing vehicles, reported third quarter earnings of $0.29 a share, up from $0.14 a year ago. Net sales rose to $46.3 million from $42.6 million.  </p>
<p>Vehicle transportation operating income in the third quarter rose 79 percent to $1.5 million. Net sales rose 10 percent to $25.1 million.</p>
<p>Chassis sales, which carry a much lower profit margin than equipment sales, accounted for 55 percent of total segment sales, rising 10 percent to $13.8 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Durakon said its pickup truck accessories segment had sales of $21.2 million, up seven percent from $19.8 million, and operating income rose 100 percent to $1.2 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and improve efficiencies are having a positive impact, and we see the potential for further progress in the quarters ahead,&quot; Wright said. &quot;However, competition has intensified and margin pressures are likely to continue. Our goal is to offset competitive pressures by leveraging our leading market positions with further cost reductions and continued introductions of innovative new products.&quot;</p>
