<p>NWE gas oil was knocked lower on Thursday by weakening premiums and easier futures. Only Russian cargo premiums were able to resist the downwards pull.</p>
<p>Traders said end-user demand was lacklustre, despite a chilly turn in Germany.</p>
<p>April IPE last traded $2.00 a tonne lower at $173.25 having struggled in thin trade for much of the day.</p>
<p>Heating oil barge premiums lost up to 50 cents with a barge understood done at April IPE -$2.50 fob ARA.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very quiet and not looking too healthy,&quot; said one barge trader of the prompt situation.</p>
<p>Dealers were more optimistic of a pick up further along the line with first half April notionally pegged around April IPE flat.</p>
<p>DIN premiums were also a touch weaker around April IPE +$5 cif Germany as were diesel cargoes.</p>
<p>Traders said at least one EN590 flexi cargo was sold into NWE at between high cif quotes flat to +25 cents for April 1-10 and unconfirmed talk of two cargoes sold at around April IPE +$11 cif Le Havre.</p>
<p>FOD remains hard to source although there was talk of a small prompt requirement that could pay a strong premium. Otherwise traders said the market was very slow even though some demand has built up.</p>
<p>Russian cargo premiums bucked the general trend because of the Asian arb takeoff. Some material was finding its way into NWE, but not enough to dent premiums. Traders said levels were holding around the April IPE +$2.50 cif done yesterday.</p>
