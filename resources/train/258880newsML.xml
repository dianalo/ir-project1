<p>The United States said on Monday it had protested to Burma's military government over the arrest of nearly 200 protesters and continuing restrictions on opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that as many as 187 students and demonstrators were detained late last week in the wake of the demonstrations and we have strongly protested this to the Burmese authorities,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have also protested the continuing restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi,&quot; Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>About 2,000 students from the Yangon University and the Yangon Institute of Technology launched anti-government protests recently, and the government responded by closing institutions of higher learning in the capital.</p>
<p>The Burmese government last week requested Aung San Suu Kyi to remain at her home until the situation returned to normal. She has said she had no links with the student protesters and has expressed displeasure at the restrictions.</p>
<p>&quot;We once again strongly urge the Burmnese government to guarantee the students can demonstrate as well as others, and we believe that the government officials should open a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi,&quot; Burns said.</p>
