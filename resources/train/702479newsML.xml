<p>Separatist tribal guerrillas have killed at least 15 people, including two policemen, in outbreaks of violence in the northeastern state of Manipur, state police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Police said Kuki tribals killed eight Naga tribesmen in Singtam village and another five in Zou Veng in Churchandpur district, some 45 km (28 miles) south of the state capital Imphal.</p>
<p>Ten Naga tribals were injured in the attacks, which occurred on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two soldiers were killed in an ambush in Rengpang in Tamenglong district, which is under strict curfew, police said.</p>
<p>The Nagas and the Kukis began fighting in mid-1992 for control of a highway which authorities say tribals use to transport drugs to neighbouring Burma.</p>
<p>Authorities say $1 billion worth of drugs is transported every year along the road, which was once firmly under the control of Kukis before the Nagas laid claim to it.</p>
