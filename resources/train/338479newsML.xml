<p>MCI Communications Corp, posting fourth quarter earnings in line with analysts' estimates, said on Tuesday that annual volume growth in long distance business was eight percent in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For the year the annual growth rate was 13 percent.</p>
<p>The company said efficiencies drove 1996 operating income up 25 percent from a year ago, excluding special items.</p>
<p>The second largest long distance company reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.44, up from $0.41 a year ago, and in line with the consensus of estimates carried on First Call.  </p>
<p>Revenues in long distance grew 10 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago and 12 percent in all of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Intergrating and simplifying MCI's product portfolio with services like MCI One and and networkMCI One has delivered rich dividends to our customers and has resulted in increased operating efficiencies for MCI,&quot; said chief executive Gerald Taylor.</p>
<p>He said that MCI had managed to target high value customers without losing existing clients in the mass long distance market.  Intralata (medium distance calling) grew 50 percent, and 1-800 collect 15 percent in 1996, he said.  </p>
<p>Business services grew strongly, Taylor said.  Data revenues grew 30 percent in 1996, and video conferencing services revenue doubled.</p>
<p>Revenue from new ventures and developing markets was $2 billion in 1996, up from $365 million in 1995, as a result of consolidating companies bought in 1995.  Net losses in this segment broadened to $298 million from $125 million.</p>
<p>Local service revenue in the fourth quarter of 1996 was $49 million, up 23 percent from a year ago and nine percent higher than the third quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Wireless revenues in the fourth quarter were $80 million, &quot;down slightly&quot; from the third quarter, and customers served increased to 400,000.  No comparison figures were given.</p>
<p>MCI, which is in the process of merging with British Telecommunications Plc, said its Concert joint venture with the British company had fourth quarter revenues of $165 million, up more than $65 million from a year ago, with year-end revenue under contract of $1.5 billion.</p>
