<title>UK: Merrill Lynch lowers aluminium/nickel forecasts.</title>

<p>Broker Merrill Lynch and Co has made major revisions to its average price forecasts for aluminium and nickel for 1996 and 1997, but raised its ideas for copper this year.</p>
<p>In its latest monthly report Merrill cut its 1996 average price for aluminium to 71 cents/lb from 74 cents, and dropped six cents off its 1997 price to 79 cents.</p>
<p>This is because consumption, notably in Europe, has been much less than anticipated this year, resulting in high stocks being carried over into 1997.</p>
<p>In nickel, Merrill has lowered this year's forecast by nine cents to 347 cents/lb, and slashed its 1997 forecast by 50 cents to 400 cents/lb.</p>
<p>This reflects nickel demand this year falling by around 2.5 percent, leaving the market roughly in balance, compared with previous estimates of a supply deficit.</p>
<p>In copper, Merrill raised its 1996 average forecast by five cents to 105 cents, as there has been fund short-covering and and good consumer interest for 1997 and even 1998 material.</p>
<p>However, 1998 as a whole could see copper prices at 70/75 cents/lb, due to a build-up in SX-EW (solvent extraction-electrowon) production, rapid increases in mine production, often ahead of schedule, and as much of this will be over and above initial name-plate levels.</p>
