<p>The Buenos Aires Stock Exchange Monday suggested the Argentine government use the bolsa for any further sale of shares in oil company YPF SA.</p>
<p>In an announcement, the exchange criticized recent privatization sales made directly by the government to big investors, which it said failed to generate popular support for private ownership of utilities.  </p>
<p>&quot;For this reason we propose that the mechanism of selling shares on the stock exchange be used, which will mean lower costs for the state as well as making the operation as transparent as possible, because the offers will be made to the general public,&quot; the exchange said.</p>
<p>It called on the government to clarify its plans about selling part of its remaining 20 percent stake in the oil company.</p>
<p>&quot;This bourse considers it convenient, as a listed company is involved, that if such a decision has been taken it be made public...especially as YPF shares have a great participation in the volume and liquidity of the market,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Roque Fernndez said last week that Argentina would have to raise $1.0 billion from privatizations this year to bridge a projected $6.6 billion budget gap. Most of that revenue would come from the sale of the YPF stake, he said.</p>
