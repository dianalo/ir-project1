<p>French President Jacques Chirac sought on Wednesday to quash rumours that he is poised to reshuffle the cabinet or call a snap general election amid pollsters warnings that either move could backfire badly on the government.</p>
<p>&quot;An early election would be like Russian roulette,&quot; said Pierre Giacometti, director of political studies at the IPSOS polling institute. &quot;It could easily swing the majority to the leftist opposition.&quot;</p>
<p>Bringing forward National Assembly elections due in March 1998, to capitalise on a slight upturn in the economy and disarray among the Socialists, might help Chirac secure a new centre-right parliament for the rest of his seven-year term.</p>
<p>The main temptation for a less risky reshuffle is that it could revive Prime Minister Alain Juppe's cabinet in its fight against record unemployment in the run-up to the elections.</p>
<p>But a new team now might look jaded by March. Also, a few new faces might be too little to lift the government's flagging popularity.</p>
<p>An official source at Chirac's office dismissed the speculation on Wednesday as &quot;without foundation...all of this is absolutely not on the agenda.&quot; But the source added: &quot;The president has time on his hands for reflection.&quot;</p>
<p>Giacometti said that even if Chirac was ruling out early elections now, he might feel tempted again in September or October. &quot;I think it's quite possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A growing number of Chirac's prominent allies in parliament have publicly debated the merits of a reshuffle or early elections in recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true this is perhaps the time when the president will take an initiative,&quot; Pierre Mazeaud, conservative head of the Assembly's legal commission, earlier told Europe 1 radio. &quot;I would rather expect a possible reshuffle. It's true that it's good to change teams.&quot;</p>
<p>Opposition far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said early elections were &quot;probable&quot; as part of a manoeuvre to shield some ministers from possible sleaze probes before they become a campaign issue.</p>
<p>He said he had put his campaign staff on a war footing.</p>
<p>Chirac has the power to call elections whenever he wants but has said in the past he has no intention of upsetting the calendar for political reasons.</p>
<p>Another major temptation to go for early elections is to avoid the 1998 election campaign coinciding with wrangling across the European Union about which countries will qualify for a single currency from 1999.</p>
<p>EU debate about which countries meet the strict economic criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty is due in early 1998 on the basis of economic performances in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be hard to make people swallow early elections. People would feel politicians were trying to confiscate the debate,&quot; said Edouard Lecerf, director of political studies at the Louis Harris polling institute.</p>
<p>He said that a reshuffle was far less risky, and could be presented as a more or less technical adjustment to the cabinet.</p>
<p>Philippe Mechet, director of political studies at the Sofres institute, said the government had no obvious bold new project to justify dissolving parliament. That meant it would have to campaign on its record.</p>
<p>&quot;All surveys show that people have a poor opinion of the record, so there is a real danger,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand dissolved the assembly in 1981 and 1988 at the start of his two terms to secure a more favourable parliament. President Charles de Gaulle dissolved parliament in 1962 to secure changes in the political system and in 1968 after the May uprising. Opinion polls this week have been contradictory about wheter French voters favour early elections or not.</p>
<p>A CSA poll on Wednesday showed 41 percent of voters questioned favoured dissolving the Assembly and 35 percent against. Last weekend, an Ipsos poll said just 23 percent were in favour and 65 percent opposed.</p>
<p>Other surveys indicate that the Socialists and their allies might well secure most votes.</p>
<p>A reshuffle could help bring back politicians who backed Chirac's former Gaullist ally, then prime minister Edouard Balladur, in a fratricidal battle for the presidency two years ago.</p>
