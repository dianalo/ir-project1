<p>Dutch financial portfolio manager Optimix Vermogensbeheer NV expects the Dutch share market to gain another 10 percent in the rest of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that Amsterdam's AEX (share) index will breach the 800 points level this year,&quot; Optimix director Henk Boom told a press conference on his company's 1996 annual report.</p>
<p>Last year the AEX index, which comprises Amsterdam's 25 most actively traded shares, gained about 33 percent. In the current year so far, it has risen another 13 percent and the index is now at a level of about 730 points. But Boom said he still thinks the market is not overpriced.</p>
<p>Based on present price/earnings ratios and the expected profit rises for Dutch companies this year, the Dutch share market is certainly not overvalued, he said.</p>
<p>Dutch companies are expected to post average profit gains of between 15 and 20 percent in 1997 and dividends are expected to rise by some 10 percent.</p>
<p>Together with the trend that more and more private and institutional investors are using shares as an investment vehicle, this is seen driving up stock prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a shortage of stocks in the coming years,&quot; Boom said.</p>
<p>The Optimix manager said that more and more countries are cutting budget deficits and state debt, which reduced their call on capital markets and made interest rate levels fall.</p>
<p>With less demand from governments for financing, institutional investors are now seeking other outlets to invest their substantial cashflows.</p>
<p>Added to this, private investors are increasingly driven to share investment funds as the interest on their savings accounts shows poor yields at the moment, he said.</p>
<p>Another factor is that the number of shares available for trading in the U.S. and elsewhere is not growing at the moment as many companies have been buying back their own shares and because of corporate takeovers. The trend is expected to continue in the years ahead, also in Europe, Boom said.</p>
<p>He expects these developments to result in a structurally higher valuation of share markets in the coming years, although some price corrections are possible in the short term.</p>
<p>But Boom said these would be based on psychological factors, when people start to think that share prices have risen too quickly, rather than on fundamental reasons.</p>
<p>Moreover, price corrections would be temporary and probably not exceed 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;These price corrections should be used to expand (share investment) positions and not to get frightened,&quot; Boom said.</p>
