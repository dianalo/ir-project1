<text>
<p>Caracas stocks on Wednesday closed lower for the third day running as interest rates rose and investor grew more concerned over rumbling labor problems at national telephone company CANTV, traders said.</p>
<p>Yields on six-month TEMs, which act as a benchmark for wider interest rates, rose 91 basis points to 18.45 percent in the central bank's regular auction on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bolsa's leading 19-share index closed off 0.58 percent at 6,328.47 points on volume of 43 million shares worth 2.6 billion bolivars ($5.5 million), according to preliminary figures from the exchange.  </p>
<p>&quot;There isn't much of a good mood, and there are no foreign investors,&quot; said Activalores broker Gonzalo Alonso.</p>
<p>A potential strike at CANTV is the latest in a wave of labor problems that have plagued Venezuela in the new year.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors, especially those abroad, are waiting to see how the company handles the situation,&quot; Alonso said.</p>
<p>CANTV officials have played down the strike threat by one of the company's 29 unions, saying it did not represent workers in ongoing talks with management over future contracts.</p>
<p>Still, the stock followed the market down, closing off five bolivars at 1925.00.  </p>
<p>Among other widely held stocks, Electricidad de Caracas lost 4.00 bolivars to close at 485.00, steel company Sivensa dropped 4.00 bolivars to end at 315.00, and food company Mavesa slipped 0.50 bolivars to finish at 157.00.</p>
