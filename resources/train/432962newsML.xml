<p>Nearly $5 million in suspected drug money was seized in Colombia's southwest city of Cali Tuesday, most of it $100 and $50 bills still sealed in wrappers from the U.S. Federal Reserve, authorities said.</p>
<p>National Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said the cash was discovered in a house believed to belong to Helmer &quot;El Pacho&quot; Herrera, the No. 4 man in the Cali drug cartel who surrendered to police last September.</p>
<p>Herrera's personal fortune has been estimated by Colombia's leading news magazine, Semana, at $11 billion and he is the target of an outstanding extradition request made by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno last summer.</p>
<p>Serrano told Reuters a sophisticated radio communications network, valued at about $1 million and complete with scanners to monitor police and military radio frequencies, was also discovered in one of six raids on suspected cartel properties in and around Cali.</p>
<p>The raids marked a major setback for what U.S. authorities have described as the world's biggest-ever criminal drug trafficking organisation, Serrano said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is biggest hit on the Cali cartel since its maximum leaders were arrested in 1995,&quot; he said. Brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejulea, the cartel's masterminds, were arrested in June and August of 1995.</p>
<p>A senior police official initially said $5.5 million had been seized in the raid on the house in the La Vega district of Cali where the suspected cocaine cash was stashed. But Serrano said the loot totalled $4.8 million and that most of it was in packets of $1,000, neatly piled away in original wrappers from a U.S. Federal Reserve bank.</p>
<p>Serrano, who spoke in a brief telephone interview with Reuters from Cali, was unable to specify which Federal Reserve bank the money had come from.</p>
