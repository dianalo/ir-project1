<p>British water industry regulator Ofwat reaffirmed on Thursday that it was considering a one-off price cut at its next review, due in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The director considers that a one-off downward adjustment in prices within the (pricing) scheme will produce demonstrably earlier benefits for customers than the system adopted at the last review,&quot; which introduced annual price caps based on inflation.  </p>
<p>Ofwat said it would consult on whether any one-off price cuts should be across the industry or specific to companies.</p>
<p>Ofwat head Ian Byatt said he was considering a new approach to funding to ensure that companies could only raise revenue from customers to meet obligations on quality after they had delivered them.</p>
<p>At the moment, customers are paying for such improvements while the work is underway, &quot;contrary to normal commercial practice,&quot; Byatt said.</p>
<p>He added that companies could be expected to use cost-reflective tariffs to balance supply and demand effectively, as well as through control of leaks and initiatives for efficiency.</p>
<p>&quot;The regulator seeks views on whether water (and sewerage companies) should be under a statutory duty to use their charging powers to promote economy in the use of water resources,&quot; Ofwat said.</p>
<p>Ofwat said that it saw no reason why expenditure by companies should be increased above historical levels in cases where service to customers had been kept up through maintenance of assets.</p>
<p>The watchdog said Byatt felt the industry remained &quot;relatively low risk,&quot; and that assessments of cost of capital should therefore not be very different from those in 1994.</p>
<p>Byatt proposed an adjustment to capital values used in calculations to reflect failures to achieve output and capital efficiencies.</p>
<p>He said supplementary expenditure made from capital efficiencies could be left in the capital value, &quot;provided there are demonstrable benefits for customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Ofwat wants comments on the proposals by October 31 and will consult with customers and consumer groups, environmental bodies, shareholders and the companies themselves.</p>
<p>The water industry's prices are currently capped by a formula based on discounts to inflation (RPI), known as RPI-X.</p>
<p>Byatt has brought forward the date of the next review by five years to 1999.</p>
<p>Water companies are currently under fire from consumer groups and the government for hefty shareholder payouts and executive salaries while leaks in pipes see nearly 800 million gallons a day seep out of their systems.</p>
<p>The new Labour government, which swept to power in a landslide victory on May 1, has set the companies a 10-point plan including mandatory targets to cut leaks in efforts to cope with a current drought.</p>
<p>It has also vowed to levy a one-off tax on the excess profits of privatised utilities as part of its first budget on July 2. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
