<text>
<p>Singapore shares kicked off the week with a soft open on Monday amid lethargic year-end volumes, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no news in the market. Volume is very, very thin,&quot; said a dealer with a local bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The actives are mainly dominated by block deals,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>At 0215 GMT, the benchmark Strails Times Industrials Index eased 4.91 points to 2,197.69. Volume was around seven million units, with gainers leading losers by 51 to 39.</p>
<p>Leading the actives was marine logistics group, Labroy Marine, which saw all 750,000 shares crossed at Singapore $1.31 (US$0.94).</p>
<p>Electronics products distributor Flextech Holdings, which was trading at S$1.16, saw 600,000 of its 649,000 shares crossed at S$1.12 and S$1.128.</p>
<p>Multimedia company Creative Technology led gainers, rising S$0.50 to S$13.90 on 19,850 shares. Dealers said the stock was fueled by Wall Street's firm performance last week.</p>
<p>The foreign tranche of Singapore Airlines and Keppel Corp fell S$0.10 each on slim volumes.</p>
<p>US$1.00 = S$1.40</p>
