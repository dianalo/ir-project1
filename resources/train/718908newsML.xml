<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: CZECH BLUE CHIP LOSSES DRAG PX50 INDEX LOWER.</title>
<headline>CZECH BLUE CHIP LOSSES DRAG PX50 INDEX LOWER.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>Czech shares were mixed on the Prague Stock Exchange on Thursday, with losses to market heavyweight SPT Telecom helping drag the PX50 index down 1.5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 506.7.</p>
<p>SPT, the most heavily-weighted issue on the index, fell 45 crowns to close at 3,555, while CEZ, the next largest stock, dipped five crowns to 915.</p>
<p>Overall on the bourse, advancers narrowly led decliners by 99 to 90, with 58 issues holding steady. Total volume was heavy at 1.06 million shares on turnover of 1.30 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Dealers said the release of economic data this morning showing another contraction of industrial output in May was more bad news for a market reeling from poor economic fundamentals that have helped turned investor attention to other bourses in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Heavy flooding in parts of the country could also damage the economy, though it is still early to tell how much, which could hurt fundamentals even further,&quot; said Boris Gomez of ING Barings. &quot;At this point, we just have to wait and see.&quot;</p>
<p>Real industrial output in May contracted by 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>Many large firms in Moravia and eastern Bohemia have been forced to shut operations after torrential rains caused some of the worst flooding in the region's history.</p>
