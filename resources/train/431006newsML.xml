<p>TRISM Inc said Monday it will record a one-time pretax charge of about $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, to write down goodwill associated with the company's investment in its Trism Transport Services, Inc commercial flatbed trucking subsidiary.</p>
<p>After giving effect to the write-down, Trism said it expects to report a net loss in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 per share for 1996.  The loss will be greater than previously expected primarily due to the writedown, it said.  </p>
<p>It said its independent audit for 1996 has not yet been completed and further revisions to the expected results are possible.</p>
<p>Trism previously announced a plan to consolidate the management of its four business units into a single administrative operation, a plan intended to improve productivity and profitability.</p>
<p>It said the writedown it disclosed does not include reorganization, severance and other expenses related to the consolidation, which will be recorded during 1997.</p>
<p>Trism is a trucking company specializing in the transportation of heavy equipment and secured materials.</p>
