<p>Germany faces the risk that unemployment will be higher, and growth rates lower than had previously been expected for 1997, a top German economist says.</p>
<p>Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist at the German Institute for Economic Research, told Reuters in an interview that while the combined six leading institutes' forecasts remain the same for now, the chance was that more jobs would be lost this year and economic growth would not reach predictions.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have much reason to be optimistic in terms of employment. What we have seen up until now is a very weak recovery in Germany, mainly based on exports, and that is not sufficient for a growth rate which could increase employment,&quot; Flassbeck told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a big risk that the 4.3 million that everybody had forecast in the sping of this year will not be sufficient.&quot;</p>
<p>Latest forecasts from Germany's six leading institutes, of which the DIW is one, predict average unemployment will be 4.28 million in 1997, while growth will fall below the government's forecast of 2.5 percent at just 2.25 percent.</p>
<p>The institutes are due to release new forecasts in June.</p>
<p>On growth, Flassbeck said he was sticking to three 2.25 percent joint institute forecasts &quot;but here, too the risk is on the lower side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Private consumption has been extremely weak in the first quarter of this year and if people continue to have rather high savings and low consumption, then growth be less than 2.0 percent,&quot; Flassbeck told Reuters.</p>
<p>He stressed, however, that this was not an official forecast, rather a description of the risk.</p>
<p>Flassbeck said European unemployment problems were due more to a lack of investment and weak growth than to inflexibility of labour markets.</p>
<p>He said German wage policy had done a great deal in efforts to stimulate growth, bringing about &quot;extremely low&quot; nominal wage increases and falling unit labour costs, but said further economic steps must be taken to pump up investment in Germany and boost internal economic growth.</p>
<p>He said, ideally, that credit rates in Germany should be cut further to encourage this investment.</p>
<p>&quot;It is still necessary to cut short-term interest rates. The repo rate is still too high,&quot; Flassbeck said. &quot;There is room to manouevre down in interest rates, but the Bundesbank is not going to move.&quot;</p>
<p>Flassbeck also said that fiscal consolidation across Europe, while necessary both economically and to meet single currency entry goals, should not be squeezed through too fast as this would threaten to push Europe into an economic slowdown.</p>
<p>&quot;The strict consolidation process should be decelarated. It is bringing the economy down and stopping the acceleration of growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Looking at currency rates, Flassbeck said the depreciation of the deutschemark against the dollar in the past six months was simply a normalisation of exchange rates which were previously out of line.</p>
<p>&quot;And I think there is more room for normalisation,&quot; he said. &quot;If the dollar/mark rate remains within the 1.70 to 1.80 range it will not be a big problem for any side of the Atlantic ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, however, that if the mark were to trade as low at 2.00 per dollar, this would &quot;not be reasonable&quot;.</p>
