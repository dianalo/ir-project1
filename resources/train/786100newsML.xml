<title>NETHERLANDS: DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEALERS AWAIT NEW PACT.</title>
<headline>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEALERS AWAIT NEW PACT.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-08-07</dateline>

<p>Dutch money market dealers were somewhat divided on a possible rise of the Dutch special advances rate this afternoon when the central bank sets a new pact since the guilder slipped further against the mark.</p>
<p>Dealers said business was slow while participants were awaiting the Dutch central bank decision on the special advances on Thursday afternoon at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>The Dutch special advances is currently pegged at 3.00 percent, equal to the German repo rate. Some dealers expected an independent rate rise in the Netherlands on guilder weakness.</p>
<p>The guilder was trading at 112.689 per 100 marks at 1230 GMT versus 112.625 on Wednesday, but dealers said the Dutch currency had been even weaker earlier today.</p>
<p>&quot;The guilder is weaker than it had been before,&quot; said one dealer, adding the current fixing might be more in balance with the current economic circumstances. &quot;I do not foresee that the Dutch central bank will raise the special advances on this as we only follow Germany,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Earlier today the Bundesbank indicated it would not make a statement on its intentions for next week's repo auction.</p>
<p>This relieved the market as some had not been excluding a rate move in Germany as the dollar had been heading higher recently versus the mark and other European currencies.</p>
<p>Another dealer said he expected a rise of the advances rate by 10 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;And then we still have to see if it supports the guilder, but I do not see there is space for a stronger rise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A quick ring round among money market dealers resulted in more &quot;no rise&quot; then &quot;yes there will be a rise&quot; opinions, but most said there was little certainty around in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's say that 25 percent of us expect a rise and the other 75 percent not,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>All money rates were stable with call money trading at 3.18 percent bid and three-month deposits at 3.36 percent bid.</p>
