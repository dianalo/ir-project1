<title>GERMANY: FDP chief expects no tax hike for EMU in Germany.</title>
<headline>FDP chief expects no tax hike for EMU in Germany.</headline>

<p>The leader of Germany's liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) said on Sunday he did not expect Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) to press him to agree to higher taxes to help Bonn qualify for the euro.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Gerhardt, whose small pro-business party has vowed to oppose any tax hike, also said Finance Minister Theo Waigel would not press the FDP to put off a cut in the so-called solidarity tax surcharge already agreed for next year.</p>
<p>Press reports said Waigel would this week suggest raising petrol taxes and putting off the solidarity tax reduction to help fill gaps in the 1997 budget he also wants to prop up with funds from a controversial gold revaluation plan.</p>
<p>Waigel's tax revenues will be 18 billion marks ($10.6 billion) less than expected this year, making it hard for him to meet EMU's three percent deficit-to-GDP target. Waigel's gold revaluation plan would bring him 20 billion marks but it cannot be used directly to fill the gap so he still needs further income.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed in the coalition to reduce the solidarity surcharge by two points at the beginning of next year ... and that will stay like that,&quot; Gerhardt told German Radio. The tax surcharge currently stands at 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>Asked about reports that the centre-right coalition could collapse if Waigel forced the new measures on the FDP, Gerhardt said he was sure Kohl's CDU would not seek support from the opposition to push through tax hikes the FDP opposed.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that we will realise our tax plans in this coalition,&quot; he said. &quot;But we cannot argue for it by dropping hints about the future of the coalition daily.&quot; ($ = 1.705 German Marks)</p>
