<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton has authorised U.S. companies to submit bids to Chile for the purchase of fighter jets, despite a 20-year virtual ban on high-tech weapon sales to the region, the United States Embassy said on Thursday.</p>
<p>(Corrects headline and first paragraph to make clear actual sales have not been approved.)</p>
<p>&quot;While the U.S. policy review of arms sales continues, President Clinton has authorised the transfer of technical information to U.S. companies that wish to compete for sales of advanced fighter aircraft to Chile,&quot; an embassy spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision was made to meet the March 31 deadline set by the Chilean air force for the submission of such data.&quot;</p>
<p>Chilean defence officials have said they were interested in buying Lockheed F-16 Falcon fighters as part of a plan to modernise the country's ageing air fleet.</p>
<p>U.S. manufacturers will have to compete with European aircraft including Swedish JAS-39 Gripen jets and French-made Mirage 2000-5 planes, El Mercurio newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The air force, which wants to buy 16-18 jets, was expected to make a decision by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Clinton's decision to ease the restrictions on sales to Chile was the result of pressure from weapons manufacturers and the recent decision by Peru to buy 18 Russian-built MiG-29 fighter jets, El Mercurio said.</p>
<p>The possible sale of the F-16s was strongly opposed by Argentina, which shares a long border with Chile, it said.</p>
<p>Chile, which returned to civilian rule in 1990 after 17 years under the military, has been gradually replacing vintage weaponry with newer equipment, including a fleet of used Mirage jets purchased from Belgium in 1995.</p>
<p>Chile's interest in the F-16s and its maintenance of one of the region's highest defence spending rates sparked fears that it risked starting a new South American arms race.</p>
<p>The former U.S. Carter administration imposed the ban on weapons sales to Latin America in 1977 when much of the region was under military rule. But the return of democracy to most countries has led to pressure from companies and governments on Clinton to lift the restrictions.</p>
