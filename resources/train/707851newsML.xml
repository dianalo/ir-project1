<headline>UK gilts close up in thin trade, longs jump ahead.</headline>
<text>
<p>1524 GMT - UK gilts closed up nine ticks in thin trade due to U.S. holiday, as the market bought up longs on interest rate rise fears.</p>
<p>* LIFFE September gilt contract up 9/32 at 114-24.  </p>
<p>The September gilt contract closed up 9/32 at 114-24/32, off its mid-session high of 114-30/32.</p>
<p>Trading was quiet due to the U.S. Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>Analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's first budget on Wednesday did not go far enough to slow buoyant consumer demand and many fear further interest rate rises are inevitable.</p>
<p>Gilts are discounting a rise of up to 50 basis points from the present 6.5 percent level next Thursday after the meeting of the Bank of England's new monetary policy committee, newly empowered by Brown to set rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;Basically everyone is still looking for rates to go higher, and there is lots of talk about eight percent next year,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Michael Dicks, UK economist at Lehman Brothers, said the budget had proved unequal to the task of tackling robust consumer demand.  </p>
<p>&quot;Base rates are likely to end at eight percent or higher by the middle of next year,&quot; Dicks wrote in a client note. &quot;The next monetary tightening will come as early as next week.&quot;</p>
<p>The race for longs had propelled some contracts ahead by one point as the market became convinced that rates would go up amid tight supply.</p>
<p>&quot;There is very good interest with the curve inversion that carried on from yesterday after people were convinced that rates are going to have to go very high, and also a lack of supply,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still trying to get hold of longs.&quot;</p>
<p>September short sterling was up one point at 92.84, discounting an interest rate rise of half a point.</p>
<p>There were no key data to move the market.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been much the quietest day of the week after a very exciting last two days and that is because the U.S. is closed,&quot; said the trader.</p>
