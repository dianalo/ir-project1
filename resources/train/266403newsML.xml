<headline>FOCUS - UK watchdog calls for tighter LME controls.</headline>

<p>Britain's top financial watchdog on Thursday told the world's biggest market for industrial metals to provide more information and tighten regulation.</p>
<p>But after a six-month review sparked by the Sumitomo copper scandal, the regulator heeded calls by many London Metal Exchange (LME) users not to make radical changes and allowed the 120-year-old exchange to retain many traditional practices.</p>
<p>&quot;Our review has pinpointed a number of areas where the LME needs to strengthen and develop its regulatory structure to reflect changes in the market,&quot; David Pritchard, an official of the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) who led the study of the LME, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The SIB, which sent out 3,500 questionnaires to consumers, producers and trading firms, called for a shake-up in the LME board structure and a stronger executive with more staff and resources.</p>
<p>Market users largely welcomed the report, saying it struck a nice balance by targeting nagging concerns without calling for over-regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they did a pretty good job...if you over-regulate you scare people away but if you don't regulate enough you lose their confidence,&quot; said Wolfgang Becker, managing director of Iceni Commodities Brokerage in Hamburg.</p>
<p>The LME will hold its regular monthly board meeting on January 15 and agreed with the SIB to come up with a timetable for addressing the recommendations by the following day.</p>
<p>SIB officials said the reforms should boost confidence in the LME and lessen the chance of another Sumitomo affair, which rocked financial markets and sent copper prices crashing when the firm uncovered a tangled web of unauthorised trades in June.</p>
<p>The Japanese giant fired star copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka, whom it accused of running up $2.6 billion in losses.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeking to do is work in a number of areas to make such events less likely,&quot; SIB chairman Andrew Large told Reuters.</p>
<p>The report said the LME needed more transparency in several areas, including inter-office trading and options. The exchange should publish price and volume indications on inter-office deals, but not necessarily in real time immediately since new expensive systems would be needed.</p>
<p>The LME should release more data on inventories and make changes in warehouse procedures, the SIB said.</p>
<p>Some LME users suggested stocks data should be come out more frequently than twice a week and the SIB advised the LME to consider this.</p>
<p>An electronic system for warrants could provide greater transparency and help regulators track positions, although cost would be a factor when the LME reviews this, it added.</p>
<p>The LME has agreed to undertake an extensive review of warehouse procedures to determine the market's susceptibility to manipulation and the effects of stocks changes on prices.</p>
<p>The SIB said a reorganisation was needed in the structure of the board to avoid conflict of interest since trading firms make decisions on both commercial and regulatory matters.</p>
<p>&quot;The present arrangements are regarded by many as favouring the ring members unduly,&quot; the report said. Regulatory decisions must not be seen to be influenced by board members' own commercial, sectional or personal interests, it added.</p>
<p>Regulatory functions should be transferred to a strengthened executive or to an independent committee.</p>
<p>The executive needs more staffing and resources and should create a new post to oversee market regulation.</p>
<p>The regulator rejected some sweeping suggestions, some coming from the U.S., that the LME make radical changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our recommendations will enhance the standards of market integrity delivered by the LME, without attempting to make members and users adopt practices more suited to other markets meeting different user needs,&quot; Pritchard said.</p>
<p>LME members could continue margin lending, mixing investor funds with the firm's own assets and non-cash clearing, in which positions only become payable when the due date becomes prompt.</p>
<p>Historic price carries, which allow customers to roll forward expiring positions at the original price, could continue only with adaquate controls, the SIB review said.</p>
