<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court says French nightwork law violates women's rights.</title>
<headline>Court says French nightwork law violates women's rights.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-03-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice said on Thursday French law prohibiting nightwork by women violates principles of equal opportunity employment under European Union law.</p>
<p>The court told the French government the Council of Ministers directive on equal treatment in the workplace guarantees women the same access to employment as men and that any national law not in compliance violates EU law.</p>
<p>All member states were to have complied with the EU law on equal opportunity by 1980.</p>
<p>The French employment code prohibits nightwork for women in plants, factories and workshops of any kind, but provides an exception for women in upper level managerial and technical positions and where serious circumstances of national interest are at stake.</p>
<p>The French law was enacted as a result of standards set by the International Labour Organization in 1948.</p>
<p>The French government denies there is any discrimination between men and women who wish to work at night, according to court papers. French lawyers argued its citizens can rely directly on the EU law before French courts and are therefore fully protected.</p>
<p>The European Commission successfully argued that France has neglected its EU obligations by not repealing this nightwork provision and replacing it with a law guaranteeing access.</p>
<p>The court said national legislation incompatible with EU law can only be remedied by the enactment of new binding legislation with the same legal force as the old law.</p>
