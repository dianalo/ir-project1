<p>U.S. refiners enjoyed a wide selection of foreign crudes on Tuesday although demand was mixed, traders said.</p>
<p>Talk of bringing North Sea Brent crude into the Gulf Coast re-emerged after fading on Monday, but none was seen arriving until around April 10-15. The price was assessed at April West Texas Intermediate/Cushing minus 15-20 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>The offer price for Norwegian Oseberg arriving April 1-5 moved up a nickel to parity with April WTI.</p>
<p>The April spread between WTI and Brent fell slightly to around $1.55 a barrel Tuesday afternoon, but was apparently still strong enough to encourage sellers.</p>
<p>Plenty of West African crude remained on offer. Traders said Nigerian Bonny Light was sold to a Louisiana refiner for early April at April WTI plus 50 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>A U.S. company is showing a Nemba cargo for April 1-8, asking April WTI plus 15 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>Another U.S. firm is asking April WTI minus 10 cents for an early April Zafiro cargo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, refiners continue to shun offers of Iraqi Basrah Light. The latest offer was heard at May WTI minus $2.10 a barrel for the second half of April.</p>
<p>Iraqi crude, like other sour grades, has been plagued by weak fundamentals. Increasing availabilities from Mexico, Venezuela, Canada and California have pushed down sour crudes into a new, lower price structure.</p>
<p>In Latin America, Colombian Cano Limon crude was assessed around $2.00-2.50 a barrel under April WTI for loading in March.</p>
<p>Plenty of Cano was available, traders said, in part because the recent Colombian strike increased availabilities. At least one trader also speculated that Exxon, a staple buyer for its Baton Rouge plant, has cut back on purchases.</p>
<p>Another trader suggested that the crude's quality has deteriorated, becoming heavier in gravity and containing more vacuum bottoms. The crude was last assessed at 29.5 degrees API gravity with 0.47 percent sulfur.</p>
