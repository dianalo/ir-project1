<p>To try to ward off undesirable currency speculation, a single European currency could in practice begin as early as 1998 when the EU decides which countries qualify, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Former European Union monetary officials and economists have begun saying that the only way to ensure that Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) starts on time on January 1, 1999 is for the Bundesbank to basically underwrite currency stability among the currencies in the EMU zone once the members are announced.</p>
<p>The membership decision is due to be made in the spring of 1998, but uncertainty remains over the period leading up the January 1, 1999, when national currencies will be &quot;irrevocably&quot; locked to the Euro, the new single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The period between the decision on EMU and its implemenation is potentially a tricky one,&quot; says Bernard Connolly, an adviser to AIG Trading Corporation and a former EU monetary official.</p>
<p>Connolly lost his job at the European Commission earlier this year after writing a book that warned of dangers from a single currency.</p>
<p>In the current issue of &quot;International Economy,&quot; a Washington-based publication, Connolly argues that for a country like Belgium -- widely seen among EMU's first entrants -- there would be a strong temptation to reduce the real burden of its outstanding debt with a currency devaluation immediately after being chosen.</p>
<p>Belgium's outstanding debt is the highest in the EU at well above 100 percent of GDP. Under the Maastricht treaty, countries wishing to join EMU must bring their debt level near 60 percent of total output.</p>
<p>While the Belgian government itself might not want to opt for such a strategy, the mere knowledge of this possibility could create a significant risk premium on Belgian debt.</p>
<p>&quot;To counter speculation on this risk and other sources of speculative activity, the conversion rates will be indicated at the same time that a decision on participation is announced,&quot; Connolly said.</p>
<p>&quot;These rates will be (Exchange Rate Mechanism) central rates and the Bundesbank will be prevailed upon to guarantee unlimited intervention to support those rates.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a situation which the Bundesbank has never faced.</p>
<p>Other economists agree there would be a strong incentive to defend the central parity rates that presently exist among the core group of EMU members.</p>
<p>&quot;Those chosen will have to announce fixed exchange rates as soon as they are picked,&quot; says Peter Kenen of America's Princeton University.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank is going to have to be prepared to do something it never has had to do -- intervene in an unlimited fashion,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But some observers, while agreeing with the basic premise of the argument, are less concerned about market speculation provided that the countries chosen have a high degree of economic convergence.</p>
<p>&quot;To me a good deal turns on whether the exchange rates ruling at the time of the announcement are regarded by the market as credible,&quot; says Christopher Taylor, a senior fellow at London's National Institute for Economic Research.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think what one is saying is that the governments that go ahead with EMU will have to start pooling their monetary policies,&quot; he added, leading to a &quot;de-facto monetary union.&quot;</p>
<p>A more important risk, adds Taylor, is some external shock, such as an oil price rise, which threatens the stability of the EMU area during the relevant period.</p>
<p>On the central issue of whether the Bundesbank is prepared to take the lead in ensuring monetary union goes off as planned, experts think the political pressure would be so great that it would have little choice.</p>
<p>&quot;They could justify it based on the political decision taken on the single currency,&quot; adds Connolly. &quot;It really wouldn't matter any more if the asset side of their balance sheet is denominated in marks or French francs.&quot;</p>
