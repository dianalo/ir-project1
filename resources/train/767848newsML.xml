<title>USA: KCBT HRW wheat called steady to one cent higher.</title>
<headline>KCBT HRW wheat called steady to one cent higher.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures were called steady to one cent per bushel higher with buying largely on momentum from recent gains as well as on expected gains in CBOT corn futures, traders said.</p>
<p>Upcoming wheat tenders by Morocco, Jordan and Iraq were anticipated, but may add only light support, they said.</p>
<p>Some KCBT traders cautioned wheat futures could open higher but quickly come under pressure from profit taking and hedge selling. Cash sales have been steady as 30-day free storage deals were due to expire this week or next.</p>
<p>Also, cash dealers said export pipelines were filled and flour mills were well supplied with wheat, both of which could curb buyer interest for wheat.</p>
