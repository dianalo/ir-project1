<p>New Zealand financial markets tumbled on Friday on a combination of local and global factors.</p>
<p>The share market fell 1.3 percent, the New Zealand dollar fell half a U.S. cent before staging a partial recovery and interest rates rose 20 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  pretty bearish,&quot; said one foreign exchange dealer.</p>
<p>There were a several factors bearing down on the markets -- uncertainty about which parties will form the government, comments from Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash on Thursday that the kiwi was near the top of its cycle and comments from U.S.  </p>
<p>Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>After eight weeks of impasse since the inconclusive October 12 election the New Zealand First Party, holding the balance of power, is on the verge of chosing between the conservative caretaker National Party government and left-leaning Labour Party.</p>
<p>A National-New Zealand First coalition is favoured by markets and partly priced in but markets are nervous that the choice may go with Labour. Few clues have been given about which way NZ First will go.  </p>
<p>As well, comments by Brash on Thursday that the New Zealand economy was at a turning point and he is expected to loosen monetary policy at the bank's December 17 Monetary Policy Statement were weighing on the currency.</p>
<p>And overlayed on that were comments from Greenspan about irrational exuberance in U.S. asset markets that were causing selling in dollar bloc currencies.</p>
<p>Greenspan's comments had most impact on the equities market where there were fears of a big fall on Wall Street tonight.  </p>
<p>&quot;This was taken as a sign that the bank considers the equities market to be overvalued,&quot; said Don Turkington, Managing Director of Cavill White Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;It really is a very major selloff...This is anticipating the jitters on Wall Street, a severe case of the jitters, and we don't like those,&quot; he said. &quot;She's a very, very nasty-looking market, and this market was down on high volume with solid selling pretty well across the board.&quot;</p>
<p>Share market volume, at NZ$288 million, was very high even discounting an exceptionally large transaction of 31.3 million Telecom shares at $7.48.  </p>
<p>Ord Minnett broker Geoff Brown said there was now less certainty about the likelihood of a coalition between nationalist NZ First and the National Party government.</p>
<p>Parties are holding meetings over the weekend and a government is expected to be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
<p>There was heavy selling in the debt market too.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of carnage out there today actually. Everything got smashed -- Canadian, Australian, U.S. -- there was really nothing that came out unscathed,&quot; a Wellington bond dealer said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said where the market would open up on Monday morning was anyone's guess, with the U.S. Treasuries' reaction to non-farm payrolls data due tonight to give a clue to direction.</p>
