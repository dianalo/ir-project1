<title>BOSNIA: Moslem president asks for EU to stay in Mostar.</title>
<headline>Moslem president asks for EU to stay in Mostar.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1996-11-09</dateline>

<p>The chair of Bosnia's collective presidency appealed on Saturday for an extension of the European Union mission in the divided city of Mostar before its mandate expires at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem member of the three-man presidency, wrote to EU ministers urging the mission to stay to help reunify the troubled city, Bosnian state radio reported.</p>
<p>&quot;A scaled-down presence of the EU mission in Mostar would encourage extremist forces trying to halt the inevitable reunification of the city,&quot; Izetbegovic's letter said.</p>
<p>Diplomats say tensions are running high in the southwest town, which remains strictly divided into Croat and Moslem- controlled sectors.</p>
<p>The EU launched its mission to help reunify Mostar in July 1994 after Moslems and Croats fought a 10-month war for territory in central and southern Bosnia.</p>
<p>Under pressure from the United States, the Croats and Moslems renewed their alliance against Bosnian Serb forces and agreed to form a Moslem-Croat federation covering half the country.</p>
<p>The federation has been plagued by disputes over power- sharing and Mostar remains a volatile flashpoint.</p>
<p>A local election in June was supposed to lay the ground for a multi-ethnic city government. But human rights workers say Croat authorities continue to block free movement and obstruct attempts at resettling Moslems expelled during the war.</p>
<p>International police monitors have been assaulted twice over the past month in Croat-held west Mostar.</p>
