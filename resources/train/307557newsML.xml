<p>China produced a record 156.45 million tonnes of crude oil in 1996, including 141.45 million that flowed from onshore wells, the China National Petroleum Corp said in a report published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The State Statistical Bureau said on Monday China produced 158.51 million tonnes of crude oil in 1996, a rise of 6.37 percent compared with 1995.  </p>
<p>Offshore fields produced a record 15 million tonnes last year, the China Daily newspaper said quoting figures from the China National Offshore Oil Corp.</p>
<p>It quoted former National Petroleum Corp president Wang Tao as saying the industry would face pressure to accelerate production with domestic demand outstripping supply.</p>
<p>He said established oilfields in China's east, which pumped 120 million tonnes of oil or 85 percent of onshore production, in the last year, faced difficulties in stabilising output.</p>
<p>Oil reserves around these fields were inadequate while it was also more difficult for these fields to control underground water after years of development, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's largest Daqing field pumped 56 million tonnes last year while Shengli, the second biggest, produced 29.10 million tonnes in 1996, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>However, exploration in China's west had resulted in discoveries of 700 million tonnes in the last year and the region pumped 20 million tonnes of crude in 1996, an increase of 2.56 million tonnes compared with 1995.</p>
<p>The Bohai sea oilfield produced 2.12 million tonnes of crude and 367 million cubic metres of natural gas in 1995, the newspaper said.</p>
