<p>British fund manager Invesco announced its widely-flagged merger with U.S. mutual fund company AIM Management Group on Monday, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses.</p>
<p>The combined group will be called AMVESCO Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger values AIM at approximately $1.6 billion, Invesco said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We are creating a prototype company for the future,&quot; Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Invesco's chairman and chief executive Charles Brady, the man who will lead the new group, said it would have &quot;the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry.&quot;</p>
<p>McCullough stressed the deal was a merger of two companies rather than a takeover, as it had been described in some quarters. The two would combine to focus on revenue enhancement but would retain their individual identities, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Brand awareness will continue. Both will retain their names in the market place,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Invesco said it would fund the merger with the issue of 290 million new shares to existing holders of AIM shares. These would be valued at approximately $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the enlarged group and be subject to restrictions on selling the shares.</p>
<p>McCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said.</p>
<p>The merger is not expected to be completed before February.</p>
<p>McCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said.</p>
<p>McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. &quot;If you look at it on the basis of funds under management, it (the cost) is less than three percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,&quot; he said. This long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.</p>
<p>Invesco had been approached by a number of banks offering it loans, with the debt element being placed with them. Both companies were currently &quot;largely debt free,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The merger presented an enormous number of synergies, with the two companies using different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.</p>
<p>There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a &quot;no-load&quot; house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM making its sales through intermediaries.</p>
<p>Both companies were &quot;really active managers&quot; and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.</p>
<p>He denied the heavy exposure to the U.S. would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. &quot;We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The merger would enhance the group's strength in the U.S., increasing the amount of its business there from between 85 and 90 percent to around 95 percent.</p>
