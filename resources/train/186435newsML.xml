<p>Pan Am World Airways Inc. is determined to capture some of its namesake's glory by acquiring additional aircraft, forging new alliances with international carriers and adding new routes within the United States.</p>
<p>Far from the industry giant that boasted a fleet of 160 aircraft flying to more international destinations than any of its rivals, the new Pan Am, which shares only its name and a few executives from the previous airline, currently operates only six planes on three routes.</p>
<p>But the Miami-based carrier, whose name will be forever linked with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, hopes to add at least three more aircraft early next year, allowing it to expand to other cities.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are trying to do is carve our niche,&quot; Pan Am President and Chief Executive Officer Martin Shugrue said in an interview this week. &quot;We're after three distinct market segments.</p>
<p>&quot;We're after leisure fliers with simple fares. We're after business fliers with value-added products ... and we're after the international connecting travelers, and that's a big part of the traffic base that we're seeking.&quot;</p>
<p>The old Pan Am, which collapsed in 1991 under the weight of heavy debt and lawsuits related to the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, returned to the skies in September, helped in part by a $5 million advertising budget.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is happy with the airline's return.</p>
<p>Lee Kreindler, an attorney who represented the families of flight 103 victims, said many relatives are angry that the airline is back in business.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of them did not want to see the Pan Am name flying -- period,&quot; he said, adding that many familes believe the airline was responsible for the bombing because its security procedures were lax.</p>
<p>Shugrue, a former chief operating officer of the original Pan Am, acknowledged the Lockerbie bombing will always be part of the airline's history, but he said critics should also look at some of the positive accomplishments as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Any company with 68 years of business is going to have tragedies and triumphs, and in Pan Am's case, the triumphs far outweigh the tragedies,&quot; he said. &quot;What we're doing is we are kind of borrowing the name. We can't take credit for the Berlin airlift, we can't take credit for the Saigon evacuation or the Tehran evacuation ... any more than we should take blame for Lockerbie.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a new company building on a great, proud name,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>While it's too early to determine if the new Pan Am will survive, Shugrue said traffic has been good, flights have been arriving on time and the company's financial performance is on track.</p>
<p>&quot;The operation is going very smoothly,&quot; he said. In six weeks of flying we've cancelled two flights. Our on-time performance is 90 percent or better between 15 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Shugrue said Pan Am expects to be &quot;cash positive&quot; in the first year of operation and profitable in the second year.</p>
<p>How much money it actually makes, however, will depend on its expansion plans.</p>
<p>Currently the airline flies three routes -- New York to Miami, New York to Los Angeles and Miami to San Juan.</p>
<p>By the first quarter of next year, Shugrue said the airline hopes to add an overnight flight from Los Angeles to New York, a popular time slot for business travelers, and a flight from San Francisco to New York.</p>
<p>In addition, he said it may expand to other destinations in the future, perhaps even a flight to Chicago or Detroit in order to service travelers from a group of international airlines that have recently formed alliances with Pan Am.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not running around with airplanes chasing markets,&quot; Shugrue said. &quot;We're going to go out and do the market research and customer research that we think is necessary and then test the appetite of our financial partners to financing whatever we do next.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't ruled anything out and we haven't ruled anything in.&quot;</p>
<p>Pan Am made a run at Carnival Air Lines in July but abandoned the effort after the companies could not agree on the terms.</p>
<p>Looking forward, Shugrue said Pan Am may announce additional acquisitions if they will help the airline improve its profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective is to make money,&quot; he said. &quot;If it means getting bigger, we'll get bigger. If it means staying the same size, we'll stay the same size, and if it means acquiring somebody else, we will acquire somebody else.&quot;</p>
