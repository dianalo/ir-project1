<p>Hungarian industrial indicators released on Tuesday confirm manufacturing as the vanguard of Hungary's swing towards growth but offer some cause for concern over inflation, analysts said.</p>
<p>Hungary's Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Tuesday the country's 1997 foreign trade deficit widened in June to $1.145 billion but showed a faster increase in exports compared to the first half of last year, 15.1 percent, than in imports, which rose 13.8 percent.</p>
<p>At the same time Hungary's producer prices rose 19.4 percent in the year up to June, up from the May year-on-year figure of 19.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;June represents a substantial improvement on the export side -- the index went up to 15.1 percent,&quot; Istvan Racz of Credit Suisse First Boston told Reuters. &quot;It's just nice -- almost 20 percent in volume terms, certainly the fastest export growth in central amd eastern Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could be slightly concerned that (PPI) is not going down -- apparently behind this monthly fluctuation there is a declining trend but it's not a very rapid trend,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;But I would still prefer the external balance and structural policy as a priority and cutting inflation very quickly should be secondary.&quot;</p>
<p>Roger Monson of Daiwa Europe in London expressed some diappointment at the trade fogures.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have liked to see perhaps a little bit more export growth compared to the imports,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;It's a bit worrying because (export growth) was running very much ahead -- the gap will close very quickly if we were to maintain (this trend) for two or three more months.&quot;</p>
<p>Monson also saw some cause for worry over the slight rise in the PPI, which continues to hold well above the consumer inflation figure, which stood at 18.7 percent on June and 18.1 percent in July.</p>
<p>&quot;We had been seeing for several months a mildly helpful trend in CPI, but with PPI now running ahead of CPI and slightly acceleration in June that has to present a yellow flag,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Monson acknowledged both sets of figures showed the economy as a whole was beginning to recover.</p>
<p>&quot;These numbers show the economy's finally coming out of the deep freeze and beginning to move a little bit,&quot; he said, adding that while the June PPI figure was not ideal, not too much should be read into one month's figures.</p>
<p>&quot;One number doesn't make a whole trend but if we see the PPI edging up to 19.7 and 20 percent in the next couple of months then that would be a different matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Racz said that the fact that within the trade figures the largest export growth was occuring in car manufacturing and electronics showed that Hungary was finally reaping the rewards of large amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) over recent years.</p>
<p>Hungary has atrracted $16 billion of FDI since 1989, according to industry ministry figres, compared to an estimated $40 billion for central and eastern Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though Hungary has collected 30 to 35 percent of foreign investment flowing through central and east Europe it has been one of the less quickly growing economies, putting into question whether FDI was that important,&quot; he said. &quot;This high export growth presents a very good answer.&quot;</p>
