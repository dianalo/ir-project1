<headline>Nor'Wester stake by India's UB Group cut.</headline>

<p>Nor'Wester Brewing Co said it amended an agreement with United Breweries of America Inc, an affiliate of the India's  UB Group so that United Breweries would invest $5.5 million in Nor'Wester instead of $8.63 million.</p>
<p>Under the original pact, United Breweries was to invest $8.63 million in cash at a price of $2.63 per share in exchange for a 45 percent equity interest in a new entity called United Craft Brewers Inc.</p>
<p>UB Group is one of India's largest beer producers, which produces the Kingfisher brand.</p>
<p>United Craft Brewers would be comprised of the consolidated businesses of Nor'Wester, its affiliate Willamette Valley Inc Microbreweries Across America and Willamette's three units - Aviator Ales Inc of Woodinville, Wash., Bayhawk Ales Inc of Irvine, Calif. and Mile High Brewing Co of Denver, Colo.</p>
<p>Under the amended agreement, United Breweries would invest $5.5 million at a price of $1.75 per share for a 40 percent stake, the company said.</p>
<p>This would reduce the valuation of United Craft Brewers to $14.84 million from $34.23 million, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain committed to our original strategy of consolidating the businesses of Nor'Wester and its affiliates under the United Craft Brewers followed by our investment in United Craft Brewers,&quot; said Vijay Mallya, Chairman of United Breweries of America.</p>
<p>Nor'Wester Brewing reported a first quarter loss of $0.11 per share compared to a profit of $0.02 per share. It attributed the first quarter operating loss mostly to the startup of its brewery in New York.</p>
<p>The company is trying to expand on the east coast of the United States instead of in the Pacific northwest, where brewery competition is intense, it said.</p>
