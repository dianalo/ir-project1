<p>Thai premier Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's superstitious wife has been carrying a jewel-studded elephant doll wherever she goes for good luck, local media reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Phankrua Yongchaiyudh has been clasping the doll publicly since she returned from a trip to Burma in March.</p>
<p>Local media said she carried the doll on the advice of a fortune teller to bring her and her husband, who is presiding over an economic crisis in Thailand, good luck.</p>
<p>She even took it to Cambodia and Laos when her husband went there for an official visit over the weekend.</p>
<p>The Nation newspaper on Monday printed a photograph of the doll seated on Phankrua's lap as she was flanked by Bun Nary, the wife of Cambodian second prime minister Hun Sen and Tubtim, the wife of Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn.</p>
<p>&quot;Phankrua is holding a jewel-studded elephant doll which she takes everywhere, reportedly believing it will keep away bad luck,&quot; the caption under the picture said.</p>
<p>&quot;She has been carrying that doll around for sometime since she returned from a trip to Burma and it is widely known that a fortune teller advised her to carry it to avert bad luck,&quot; said a reporter who accompanied the premier on his weekend trip.</p>
