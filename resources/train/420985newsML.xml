<p>An expected decline in jet fuel spot prices should give an important and welcome boost to Asia-Pacific airline profits in the second half of this year and through 1998, Salomon Brothers said in its latest Asia-Pacific Airline Industry Review.</p>
<p>The review details how successful carriers have been with fuel hedging strategies in combating high fuel prices over the past 12 months during which Singapore spot jet kerosene prices have risen as high as US$35 per barrel.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers said they expect prices to fall from about $29 per barrel at present to $25 by the end of the 1997.</p>
<p>Hedging strategies by Cathay Pacific and Qantas have paid handsome dividends and the review estimates they have lowered their fuel charges by almost 10 per cent while most other carriers should have marginal gains or losses, giving them close to an average spot price.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate small profits from Singapore Airlines' hedging programme over the current year, while the recent interim profit result from Qantas highlights that the company has been quite successful in containing its fuel costs. We estimate that Qantas' treasury operations lowered its fuel bill by Australian $40 million in the six months to December 1996,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific's strategy of &quot;catastrophe insurance,&quot; which equates to a series of caps on a one-year rolling basis, will pay &quot;handsome dividends&quot; this year, the review added. Applying the same analysis of fuel costs to Malaysia Airline System shows the company has had &quot;amazing success&quot; over recent years, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;As a matter of conservatism, we have assumed that MAS' fuel cost paid approaches spot market prices over fiscal 1997 and 1998. Both Thai Airways International and Air New Zealand have no effective hedging in place and sharp price increases have had significant negative impacts on their recent profit results,&quot; the review adds.</p>
<p>The forecast decline in spot prices will provide only limited benefit for Qantas and Cathay Pacific, according to the review.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular, we expect earnings growth to be reduced by 5-10 percent in 1997 as a result of the companies' success in the previous year. Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and Air New Zealand have the most to gain from any sustainable decline in fuel prices over the coming year,&quot; the review concludes. -- Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017</p>
