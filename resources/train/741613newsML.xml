<p>Kuwait will soon move to collect 100 million dinars ($330 million) owed by some Arab states which supported Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, a senior banking official was quoted on Sunday as saying.</p>
<p>Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development General Manager Badr al-Humaidi &quot;said that arrears owed by opponent states (Iraq supporters) would be collected soon,&quot; al-Rai al-Aam daily reported.</p>
<p>The Fund &quot;did not carry out any contacts since (the 1991) liberation with these countries -- Jordan, Yemen, Sudan and Mauritania,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Kuwait downgraded ties and cut generous economic aid to several states it accused of supporting former occupier Iraq during the Gulf crisis.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Kuwait has said it would improve ties with some of these countries and a few steps were taken despite criticism by parliamentarians. Diplomats say the moves also lack popular support from many ordinary Kuwaitis.</p>
<p>Oil-rich Kuwait originally created the Fund to offer fellow Arab states soft loans and technical assistance grants for public works projects and has extended operations to include a host of developing countries. obtaining loans from the Fund.</p>
