<title>AUSTRALIA: FORECAST-Australian interest rates poll - August.</title>
<headline>FORECAST-Australian interest rates poll - August.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board meets on Tuesday August 5.</p>
<p>Official interest rates were cut by 0.5 percentage points to 5.0 percent last Wednesday, a move that had widely been expected to follow Tuesday's board meeting.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting and after the rate cut, Reuters asked 29 economists three questions on the outlook for rates.</p>
<p>1)  What is the percentage chance of another cut in official interest rates?</p>
<p>Median - 30 pct, range 10 pct to 70 pct</p>
<p>2) What is the direction of the most likely next move in rates?</p>
<p>UP   - 21</p>
<p>DOWN -  6</p>
<p>UCHANGED - 1</p>
<p>UNCHANGED/EASING BIAS - 1</p>
<p>3) When would that move happen?</p>
<p>		 UP		  DOWN(includes one strong ease bias)</p>
<p>		  Q1 98 - 1	Q3 97 - 1</p>
<p>		  Q2 98 - 2	Q4 97 - 6</p>
<p>		 mid 98 - 3</p>
<p>		  Q3 98 - 7</p>
<p>		  Q4 98 - 2</p>
<p>2nd half of 98 - 5</p>
<p>		  Q1 99 - 1</p>
<p>A sixth rate cut in this cycle is seen by most as unlikely, although a significant minority -- seven out of 29 -- see an easing as likely or the RBA as having a strong bias to ease.  </p>
<p>Those expecting a tightening as the next move do not expect it for some time -- the earliest forecast is for the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>Generally it is expected by the middle of next year.</p>
<p>Economists said that with one year now having passed since the first rate cut, its impact should start to be seen in some stronger data, and the impact of the subsequent cuts will also start to flow through.  </p>
<p>The employment market is also expected to gather strength going into 1998, and with the economy moving back towards 4.0 percent growth, some price and wage pressures may emerge, requiring a pre-emptive tightening by the RBA.</p>
<p>For those looking for a rate cut, the inflation outlook and the excess capacity in the economy are seen as key factors.</p>
<p>The economy has come off the boil in the second quarter after a strong start to 1997, meaning it is lacking momentum going into the second half of the year.  </p>
<p>With unemployment still seen sluggish, the currency expected to hold up or improve on current levels, and given the RBA'S confidence on the inflaton outlook, there is room for further rate cuts even with stronger growth figures into the end of the year, they said.</p>
<p>If a cut does come, it is expected before the end of the year.</p>
