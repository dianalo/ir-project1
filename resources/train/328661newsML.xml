<p>The estimated size of Britain's 1996/97 beet crop will probably have to be revised upwards as damage wreaked by December frosts seems to be minimal, beet experts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Very little beet is thought to have been affected by last month's freezing temperatures, worsened by a chill factor from persistent winds, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The beet is still in remarkably good condition,&quot; said an official at British Sugar.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to make the quota, there's no problem there -- and there will be some more. It will be a well above-average result.&quot;</p>
<p>British Sugar normally declines to give estimates of final sugar output but has said this year's result should be above the five-year average.</p>
<p>Just three percent of the crop was still in the ground as of last week, the official said. This compared with one percent at the same stage last year.</p>
<p>The European Commission, basing its forecast of U.K. output on British Sugar figures, has estimated 1.303 million tonnes, white value.</p>
<p>But analysts say this figure is likely to be on the low side, especially as estimates for key producers France and Germany have both been upgraded.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised to see an upward revision...I would be surprised to see it stay at 1.3 and I would expect it to go up,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;By the time we had the severe frosts the majority of the crop was in -- I don't think it would have had a huge impact, especially if with the earlier part of what they harvested they got a high sugar content,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>According to the British Sugar official, last week's sugar content reached 17.5 percent after 15.7 percent last year.</p>
<p>He added that 21 percent of the crop was in store compared with 16 percent last year, and 75 percent was delivered after a previous 82 percent.</p>
<p>But an official at the National Farmers Union (NFU) voiced concern over the unknown quality of some of the remaining beet in storage as it could have been lifted in imperfect weather conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still concern and we're not out of the worst of it,&quot; she said, adding that British Sugar would have to wait at least a month to gauge the quality of the entire crop.</p>
<p>&quot;Only time will tell if that is going to be good beet at the end of it (campaign). It may be that we lose a lot in the final reckoning -- there is still quite a high percentage to actually process.&quot;</p>
