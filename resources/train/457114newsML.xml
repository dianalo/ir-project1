<p>British property firms Burford Holdings Plc and Brixton Estate Plc on Thursday underlined the improvement in the British property market by reporting higher profits.</p>
<p>Burford reported an increase in its net asset value (NAV) per share but Brixton saw a strong pound and lower than expected valuations on some of its office buildings taking their toll on its NAV.</p>
<p>Both increased pre-tax profits and total dividends for the year. Burford made 15.05 million pounds ($24.1 million) compared with 11.6 million in 1995 but Brixton achieved only a 2.8 percent rise to 36.12 million pounds from 35.14 million.</p>
<p>Brixton's finance director Steven Owen told Reuters that he was surprised by the drop in NAV to 181 pence from 188 pence in 1995.</p>
<p>While disappointed, he said improved valuations due to increased lettings and overseas interest in the industrial sector, in which Brixton specialises, should improve the figure during 1997.</p>
<p>Brixton's share price fell 19.0 pence to 183.5 pence due to the drop in NAV. Brixton said it would continue to shift its business back to Britain, concentrating on industrial property and warehouses in the southeast of the country.</p>
<p>Shares in Burford, which is smaller but has a high profile due to its involvement in several developments in London's West End, fell 6.5 pence to 138.5 pence.</p>
<p>Chief executive Nick Leslau told Reuters Burford would continue to outperform the market. &quot;We've made it clear that if we can't outperform the market we'll sell the company.&quot;</p>
<p>Burford's NAV rose to 110.1 pence from 101.5 while the NAV per shareholder, which included free shares from the 1996 demergers of Grantchester and Columbus, rose 21 percent to 122.9 pence.</p>
<p>Burford has developed high profile properties in London such as the now demerged Trocadero Plc entertainment centre on Picadilly Circus and also bought industrial, retail and office sites outside the capital.</p>
<p>Burford holds 25 percent of Trocadero, which owns the Enid Blyton company and recently completed talks to put the children's book character &quot;Noddy&quot; on to U.S. television.</p>
<p>Leslau said Burford would continue to be a deal-led venture, but would not forget its shareholders. Burford was working on a joint venture with an established hotel operator to set up &quot;lifestyle hotels&quot; in central London.</p>
<p>Burford has already bought four properties it plans to develop, including one in the Soho district.</p>
<p>Brixton and Burford were both upbeat about prospects for the British property sector, which showed signs of sustained recovery in 1996 but has so far been largely restricted to certain areas and has been more pronounced in some sectors.</p>
<p>Burford's chairman Nigel Wray said the company needed to maintain a strong financial base &quot;because none of us knows when the cold wind may blow&quot;. But he added that 1997 looked interesting.</p>
<p>Douglas Gardner, Brixton's chairman, said the recovery in the industrial sector, which had historically been later than in other sectors, &quot;is now well established&quot;.</p>
<p>He was encouraged by a recent survey of industrial markets showing a six percent decrease in industrial stock in the southeast and a shortage of new industrial and warehouse space in the greater London area.</p>
<p>&quot;With the increase in tenant demand and the decrease in the supply of space, the prospects for more widespread rental growth are encouraging,&quot; Gardner said.</p>
