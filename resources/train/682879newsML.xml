<p>QLD TOURISM MINISTER DEFENDS HIS RHINO HUNT IN SOUTH AFRICA</p>
<p>Queensland's Tourism Minister Bruce Davidson has been forced to issue a statement defending a trip he has taken to South Africa to discuss plans to establish a rhinoceros park in North Queensland.</p>
<p>The Opposition maintains the expedition is nothing more than a junket for Mr Davidson and his mates.</p>
<p>The Opposition claims the project is being pushed by a Sunshine Coast mate of Mr Davidson's and that the research scientist who has endorsed it has connections with the proposed sanctuary.</p>
<p>Mr Davidson has dismissed the Opposition claims and says the scientist has no vested or financial interest in the project.</p>
<p>Mr Davidson claims he has met a senior advisor to South African President Nelson Mandela to discuss the project.</p>
<p>He says the advisor raised concerns about the Australian media not supporting the plans and Mr Davidson says he was forced to apologise to him for the Opposition's negativity.</p>
<p>Mr Davidson says the park is supported by the majority of Queenslanders and there are plans for further talks with South African officials over the next few days.</p>

<p>POLICE EVIDENCE ON MURDER OF NSW MP</p>
<p>New South Wales Police have confirmed they've forwarded a brief of evidence on the 1994 murder of MP John Newman to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old Member for Cabramatta, in Sydney's west, was gunned down outside his home on the September 5, 1994.</p>
<p>His killers have never been caught, despite intensive investigations by a special taskforce set up to investigate the murder.</p>
<p>Taskforce Gap is now seeking advice on whether it can lay criminal charges.</p>
<p>It's believed detectives have now identified up to three people they want to charge with conspiring to kill Mr Newman and are seeking indemnities from prosecution for two other witnesses.</p>
<p>Head of Taskforce Gap, Mike Hagan, says a brief of evidence has been forwarded to the DPP via the Crime Commission.</p>
<p>Detectives are still awaiting legal advice.</p>

<p>SEARCH FOR MISSING TODDLER ENTERS 11TH DAY</p>
<p>On its 11th day, the search for missing toddler Jaidyn Leskie at Moe in Victoria's south east will again be stepped up. Yesterday a 140 strong search party scoured bush and swampland in Moe only to come up empty handed.</p>
<p>Police have decided to step up the search with water police combing swampland on the Edward Hunter Reserve and Lake Narracan.</p>
<p>Search Co-Ordinator, Senior Constable Oscar Artson, says 14 members of the Force Response Unit will travel to Moe this morning to investigate specific information that clues about Jaidyn's disappearance are at the local rubbish tip.</p>
<p>Senior Constable Arston says police believe they have isolated the area where rubbish was dumped and will be concentrating on that area.</p>

<p>REPORT DUE ON PORT ARTHUR PROBLEMS</p>
<p>The Doyle Report into the problems besetting Port Arthur is expected to be released publicly today.</p>
<p>The report was prepared by the Tasmanian Government's special commissioner for Port Arthur, Max Doyle, in response to the upheaval caused by last year's massacre.</p>
<p>A joint parliamentary group, which has been considering the recommendations for a week, met last night to discuss details of the release.</p>
<p>The report examines the role of management after the shootings, staff morale, and in what direction the site's future should be guided.</p>
<p>Parliamentary group member Bruce Goodluck MHA says recommendations will remain confidential until after today's release, with Port Arthur staff first to view the document followed by a release to the media later in the day.</p>

<p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN TROUBLED WATERS</p>
<p>The Constitutional Convention to debate whether Australia should become a Republic, is now unlikely to be held until next year, if at all.</p>
<p>The Senate has for the second time rejected the Government's plan to have convention delegates elected through a voluntary postal ballot.</p>
<p>The Opposition again combined with the minor parties and Independent Senator Brian Harradine to insist on a compulsory, direct ballot.</p>
<p>But this is a change the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the convention, Nick Minchin, continues to reject.</p>
<p>Senator Minchin says it is absolutely unreasonable for the Senate to deny the Government of the chance to implement its policy.</p>
<p>But Labor's Senate Leader, John Faulkner, takes a different view, saying Labor has an unwavering commitment to the Australian style of ballot, which is compulsory and secret.</p>
<p>The Senate's decision means a vote for delegates now cannot be staged in time for a December convention.</p>
<p>The legislation is likely to be re-submitted to the Senate in September, meaning the convention, if it does take place, could not be held until at least March next year.</p>
