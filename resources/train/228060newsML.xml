<title>RUSSIA: Some Russian shares active but many being held.</title>

<p>A handful of Russian share issues reacted to company specific news in afternoon trading on Monday, but dealers said the market as a whole was quietening down and they preferred to hold rather than sell at the slow end of year.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index closed up about one percent at 189.73 on $10.5 million market turnover, a relatively low volume which has become average over the last week.</p>
<p>Surgutneftegaz preferred shares firmed to $0.3050 from $0.2935 after the oil company announced plans to issue an American Depositary Receipt specifically for the prefs.</p>
<p>Regional utility Murmanskelektrosvyaz jumped over 40 percent to $15.00 on 10,000 shares trading for the day, fairly typical of price activity in illiquid shares 'discovered' by investors.</p>
<p>But utility Mosenergo, the bellwether of the share market, did not register a single trade on the Russian Trading System.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next month and a half we will have dramatic stock-specific moves but no marketwide moves, barring major events,&quot; said Troika-Dialog's Terry Olin.</p>
<p>Some traders predicted the market would stay in a five percent range on either side of current prices until year's end as many investors sat on shares, indicating a lengthening investment horizon, waiting for new funds to move the market.</p>
<p>Peter Kizenko of ING Barings said many second-tier buyers with six-month or longer holding horizons would likely avoid new buying rather than take profits, which was often the case in past activity slowdowns.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of buyers are stepping away because they overheated it,&quot; he said, adding that some were still ready to buy, anticipating much sharper price appreciation in the new year.</p>
<p>Olin said regional telecoms were showing some profit-taking, though, which he linked to news that Russia was no longer using London-based investment bank N.M. Rothschild as adviser on sale of a stake in telecoms holding company AO Svyazinvest.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is afraid that since a handful of powerful Russian banks will manage the Svyazinvest offering, there may be no injection of capital into the firm and its regional telecoms,&quot; he said.</p>
