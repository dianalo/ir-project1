<text>
<p>Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said the government has no plans to curb consumption after the end-of-year holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no plans to restrict consumption after Christmas,&quot; Malan told reporters.</p>
<p>Malan said Brazil's seven percent GDP growth rate in the third quarter was excessive, but would not be sustained. He said he expected a &quot;reasonable growth rate&quot; next year.</p>
<p>Local analysts have speculated the government is considering restrictions on consumption as a way of cooling what many consider an overheated economy.  </p>
<p>Malan said the large number of corporate and consumer defaults in the second half of 1994 and the first half of 1995, after the introduction of the Real Plan, was still fresh in the mind of most people.</p>
<p>He noted that that experience has served as a natural damper on consumers and on financial institutions offering credit when the introduction of the real currency prompted a consumer boom.</p>
<p>&quot;This functions as a natural stabilizer for the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
