<p>Union leaders said on Wednesday they would urge Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer to save 3,100 jobs in Belgium by keeping open at least temporarily a plant that the loss-making auto maker has vowed to shut down.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to have an initial meeting with Mr Schweitzer and to convince him to change his mind,&quot; said union spokesman Karel Gacoms.</p>
<p>But Renault's case for the planned closure, which has sparked protests across Europe, will be bolstered by an earnings report due out on Thursday which is expected to show more than 4.5 billion francs ($800 million) in losses for 1996, the firm's first annual loss in 10 years.</p>
<p>Schweitzer and union officials have agreed to meet at 3 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Wednesday on &quot;neutral ground&quot; in the northern French town of Beauvais, roughly midway between Renault's Paris headquarters and the assembly plant at Vilvoorde which Renault has said it will shut by July 27.</p>
<p>Despite a spate of kidnapping of bosses in France by angry workers, Renault said it was not worried about Schweitzer's safety.</p>
<p>&quot;Belgian trade unionists have always behaved themselves,&quot; a company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She reaffirmed that the car maker considered its decision to close the plant to be irrevocable but would not say whether it was flexible on the July 27 deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;They are meeting to discuss the closing of the Vilvoorde plant. There is no question of our changing our mind. They are going to discuss implementation,&quot; the spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Asked whether the deadline was also set in stone, she said Renault would have nothing more to say until after the meeting.</p>
<p>Union leaders said they planned initially to ask Schweitzer to back down and keep the plant open with an across-the-board cut in working hours at Renault.</p>
<p>Gacoms said enough work could be found to keep Vilvoorde's employees busy by trimming the hours at Renault plants across Europe by 10 percent.</p>
<p>But Renault has said the main purpose for the shutdown is to streamline its car assembly operations in Europe.</p>
<p>The car division has been losing money since the second half of 1995. Schweitzer said Renault's operations were too dispersed among plants that are much smaller than those of its rivals.</p>
<p>The company's performance deteriorated last year, when a downturn in the U.S. and European truck industries drove its commercial vehicle business into the red as well.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate Renault will show a loss of more than 4.5 billion francs for 1996, including a 2.4 billion franc charge to pay for the closure of the Belgian plant.</p>
<p>If Renault insists on the shutdown, union leaders said they would ask Schweitzer to keep it open until it found a buyer.</p>
<p>One possible buyer might be Toyota, which has been studying the feasibility of a new plant in Europe.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene on Tuesday urged Schweitzer to consider the unions' proposals.</p>
<p>He said they wanted to keep the plant open, after restructuring, for two to three years, during which a final solution could be worked out.</p>
<p>Early retirement and shorter working weeks with a cut in social charges could be applied in the restructuring moves, he said.</p>
<p>Renault's decision to close the plant has triggered opposition across Europe but particularly in Belgium, where trade unions denounced the shock announcement as &quot;unbelievably brutal&quot;.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac has said he disapproved of the way the move was handled but acknowledged that plant closures &quot;are, alas, part of life&quot;. The French state is the largest shareholder in Renault, with 46 percent.</p>
<p>The high-cost facility in Vilvoorde assembles Megane and Clio models. Renault said its output could be matched by the equivalent of 1,900 jobs at other, more efficient plants. ($ = 5.65 French Francs)</p>
