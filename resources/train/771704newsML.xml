<p>Heavy rains have flooded  vast areas of southeastern Bangladesh, leaving some 50,000 people  stranded in half-submerged homes, government officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The deluge began on Thursday in the Cox's Bazar district as residents  were still recovering from last month's floods which killed at least  100 people and made thousands homeless.</p>
<p>The road between Cox's Bazar town and the port of Chittagong was submerged  in places and impassable.</p>
<p>There was no immediate word on damage to crops but officials said  the impact would be limited if the waters receded within three or  four days.</p>
<p>At least 10 people were missing after several fishing boats sank in  the Bay of Bengal on Thursday evening, fishing community leaders in  Cox's Bazar told reporters.</p>
<p>The rain also swept refugee camps where most of the 21,000 Burmese  Moslems who fled into Bangladesh in 1992 to escape alleged military  persecution continued a food boycott for a 12th day.</p>
<p>&quot;The rain caused a temporary lull in the refugees' routine demonstration  at the camp gates but they are safe inside,&quot; a police officer said.</p>
<p>The refugees, known as Rohingyas, started refusing food on July 21  in protest alleged attempts by Bangladesh to send them back to Burma  by force.</p>
