<p>The PLO said on Saturday that a failed U.S. mediation bid proved the Clinton administration must rethink its policy if it is to save Israeli-Palestinian talks locked in a crisis termed &quot;very dangerous&quot; by a European envoy.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's adviser Ahmed Tibi charged Washington was in effect abandoning its long-held stance rejecting new Jewish settlement construction on occupied land.</p>
<p>Tibi spoke after the overnight departure of U.S. President Bill Clinton's lead Middle East troubleshooter Dennis Ross, whose nine days of marathon mediation failed to lift the crisis.</p>
<p>Israeli-PLO talks broke down two months ago in the wake of Israel's decision to build a settlement in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. administration must reconsider its Middle Eastern policies, especially concerning the PLO-Israeli track, if it is genuine in resolving the crisis ... because its policies so far have been a failure,&quot; Tibi told Reuters.</p>
<p>Underscoring Palestinian restiveness over the stricken peace process, some 2,000 supporters of the militant Islamic Hamas movement massed in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday in a &quot;Rally for Jerusalem&quot;, denouncing the peace process in banners reading &quot;No compromise and no peace&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has become very dangerous,&quot; Miguel Angel Moratinos, the European Union's Middle East envoy, said in Cairo. &quot;The peace process must be saved.&quot;</p>
<p>Moratinos said he would head for Gaza on Sunday for talks with Palestinians, then go to Israel and to talks co-sponsor Russia in a redoubled EU effort to seek a breakthrough.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union will do all it can through diplomatic channels to save the peace process,&quot; Moratinos said.</p>
<p>Washington, Israel's main ally, has toned down its rhetoric on Jewish settlements in an apparent nod to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, calling settlement an issue to be resolved between the parties involved.</p>
<p>&quot;The international community's position, including that of the U.S., on settlements is that they are illegal,&quot; Tibi said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the U.S. is now abandoning this position and adopting the Israeli position by hiding behind the pretext that settlements are a final-status issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the 1993 PLO-Israeli peace deal, settlements and Jerusalem are among volatile core issues left for &quot;final status&quot; talks to be completed by 1999.</p>
<p>The accord states that no side shall take unilateral actions that prejudge the outcome of permanent status talks, stalled at the gate since Netanyahu's government took office in June.</p>
<p>Palestinians charge that Israel violated the accord in March by breaking ground on a settlement in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in 1967 and declared part of its capital in a claim unrecognised internationally. The PLO sees East Jerusalem as capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>Israel turned aside PLO criticism of U.S. policy and of its point man Ross. &quot;Dennis Ross is a very fair mediator and is doing very a good job,&quot; Netanyahu aide Shai Bazak told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bazak said the PLO had as yet failed to fulfil Israel's demands for cooperation in the fight against guerrilla attacks.</p>
<p>Egypt, which in the past has mediated between the sides, laid the blame for the impasse squarely at Israel's door.</p>
<p>In blunt remarks, Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Israel's refusal to curb settlement on Arab land was responsible for the logjam. He urged Washington to call its ally to order.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. Secretary of State (Madeleine Albright), due to her experience and position, enjoys a lot of influence which can benefit these difficult circumstances in which the doors of peace are being closed one after the other because of Israel's obstinacy,&quot; Moussa told reporters after meeting Moratinos.</p>
<p>Albright, meeting Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on Friday, said she would visit the region only when the parties made the &quot;difficult decisions&quot; required to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>The U.S. could provide only limited help to move the Middle East peace process forward, and it was up to the Israelis and Palestinians to make the compromises needed, Albright said.</p>
