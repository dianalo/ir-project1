<p>September gilts will try and push up towards congestion at 114-16,17 on Monday before drifting back, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>But a break of that area would open up the potential for a move to 114-31, the high on May 9, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact the market made it higher on Friday is encouraging short term and suggests we're going to have a look at 114-16,17,&quot; said Marc Ostwald, technical analyst at London Bond Broking here.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll probably drift back from there, but if we do go through it, we could go to the 114-31 high.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ostwald said while underlying technicals for gilts were fairly encouraging, and the contract may benefit from safe-haven status if single currency worries resurface, some concerns such as the upcoming British budget would keep a lid on gains.</p>
<p>He put initial support at 113-25,27. Charts show 113-25 was the low on Friday, and the high on June 5.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get down to 113-25, we could push down a bit further, but not enormously,&quot; said Otwald. He put further support at 113-15, the lows last Thursday and Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were to drift below that, we would establish a base around 113-00,&quot; said Ostwald.  </p>
<p>Juliette Clark at the Royal Bank of Scotland said the near-doji formation on candle charts on Friday suggested gilts were in for a period of turbulent trading. A doji is where the opening and closing are at the same level.</p>
<p>&quot;The long term view is still firmly bullish though, and the break above the interim high at 114-08 is constructive,&quot; she said in a note for clients.</p>
<p>She said momentum indicators suggested plenty of scope for gains over the next week, with the positive impetus growing once 114-10 was hurdled.</p>
<p>By 0722 GMT September short sterling was unchanged at 93.15.</p>
