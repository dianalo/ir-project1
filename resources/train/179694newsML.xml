<p>Advisers of U.S. energy group Dominion Resources Inc on Monday telephoned their potential bid target, British electricity supplier East Midlands Electricity, to ask for a first meeting, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>But he told Reuters that East Midlands, which has a current market capitalisation of around 1.196 billion stg, had not yet responded to the invitation for talks about a possible offer, that was first muted last week.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not sure when that (meeting) will be,&quot; he added, noting that the telephone conversation had shed no light on the exact price the U.S. company was considering.  </p>
<p>The spokesman said he believed the two companies would meet &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>The Virginia-based utility said on Thursday that it was considering a bid &quot;at a price not much in excess of 608 pence per share&quot; -- a level that was scorned by East Midlands.</p>
<p>A 608p per share bid would value East Midlands at about 1.2 billion stg.</p>
<p>East Midlands said on Monday that it had nothing to add to its statement last Thursday, in which it said it would reject an offer at such a level because it would undervalue the Nottingham-based electricity company's prospects.  </p>
<p>The spokesman for Dominion Resources noted that the U.S. group was well aware of the uncertainties, both regulatory and political, that surrounded the purchase of a UK power group.</p>
<p>The popular opposition Labour Party has threatened to impose a windfall tax on the profits of the 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies and other utilities if it comes to power in the next general election, due by May 1997.</p>
<p>But the U.S. group may feel its bid will win approval from regulators as Britain has so far cleared three U.S. bids for regional electricity companies (RECs).</p>
<p>If Dominion Resources decides to make a bid, it would be the fifth U.S. bid for a REC.</p>
<p>CE Electric, jointly owned by CalEnergy Co and  Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc, launched a hostile 650 million stg for REC Northern Electric on October 28.</p>
<p>East Midlands, the first of its peers to start buying back its shares in a move to return cash to shareholders, saw its stock close at 603 pence, up 9.5 pence on the day.</p>
