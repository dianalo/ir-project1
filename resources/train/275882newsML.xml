<p>Hong Kong stocks jumped ahead in early Tuesday morning trade, on good liquidity and buying interest in the index's heavy weight counters, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing some follow through buying from yesterday,&quot;said one broker with a large Asian house.&quot;We should end the morning 50 to 60 points up.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index put on 76 points to trade at 13,407, after a weak opening saw the index dip to a low of 13,278.06. Turnover was a healthy HK$1.20 billion after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like some year end bonus money is going into HSBC,&quot; said the broker.</p>
<p>Property stocks led the market's 200-point rise on Monday, but finance counters, chiefly HSBC Holdings, were the stars on Tuesday.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings added HK$1.50 to HK$163.50 and subsidiary Hang Seng Bank HK$0.75 to HK$93.50. Bank of East Asia put on HK$0.30 before easing to trade up HK$0.10 at HK$34.40.The sector leads off the annual reporting season beginning in mid-January, brokers pointed out.</p>
<p>The market's early strength took many brokers by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought it would be a quiet day,&quot; said Ronald Lam, chief dealer at Dao Heng Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no bad factors, only positive news,&quot; said Lam, adding investors were showing renewed confidence in the property sector.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong led the sector with a gain of HK$0.25 to HK$69.00 while other counters came in for profit-taking.</p>
<p>Great Eagle slid HK$0.40 to HK$32.50 and Hang Lung shed HK$0.35 to HK$16.85. Amoy Properties bucked the trend putting on HK$0.15 to HK$11.15.</p>
<p>Red chip Shanghai Industrial showed the second best gain after HSBC with a rise of HK$0.60 to HK$25.80.</p>
<p>December Hang Seng Index futures, which had traded up 75 points to a high of 13,525, eased in mid-morning trade to 13,465, a 10-point gain.</p>
<p>The March contract was trading at a day high, 60 points up at 13,630.</p>
