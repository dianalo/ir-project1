<p>Croatia will launch a delayed value-added tax (VAT) next year to complete the fiscal reform, Finance Minister Bozo Prka said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;VAT goes ahead definitely,&quot; Prka told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;There was never any dilemma if VAT should be implemented or not. It is vital for harmonising our fiscal system with that in most parts of Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>VAT was due to be introduced at a single rate of 22 percent from January this year to replace the turnover tax, currently around 26 percent.</p>
<p>But its launch was put off under pressure from various groups, warning against a price increase of basic products such as foodstuffs that are now taxed at a lower rate.</p>
<p>A shortfall in tax revenue in the election year was another worry for the ruling HDZ party that the Croatian opposition may have used against it.</p>
<p>The government is even now weighing different macroeconomic considerations against social concerns, Prka said.</p>
<p>Various proposals including lower tax on tourist services and a zero rate on baby food have also been put forward since VAT was scrapped.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not exclude the possibility of two rates, but no more,&quot; the minister said. &quot;The second rate would only apply to a very narrow group of products.&quot;</p>
<p>Prka said one of the aims of VAT was to ease the fiscal burden, and the government hoped it would also have a slight deflationary effect.</p>
<p>But its introduction was seen as initially raising at least some prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be a one-off increase, but the balloon will slowly deflate. We do not want to use VAT to raise more tax revenue or increase the (fiscal) burden.&quot;</p>
<p>VAT should simplify things and eliminate a cascading effect that the current multiple taxation has on all except simplest of products, he added.</p>
<p>This is estimated to make sophisticated products some three percent more expensive through taxes on raw material, power and other costs piled up in various stages of production.</p>
<p>VAT's introduction is also designed to boost Croatia's competitiveness abroad, partly through tax refunds, Prka said.</p>
<p>&quot;VAT will reduce the burden, particularly for export businesses. It should significantly cut down the prices of companies such as (electrical firm) Koncar, of the machinery and shipbuilding,&quot; he said. -- Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
