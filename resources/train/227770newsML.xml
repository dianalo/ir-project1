<p>River Plate, beaten finalists in the Intercontinental Cup final against Juventus last Tuesday, returned to the top of the Argentine championship on Sunday with a 5-1 hammering of Ferro Carril Oeste.</p>
<p>River overtook Lanus who went down 2-1 to Independiente at home while crisis club Boca Juniors crashed 4-2 away to Racing Club.</p>
<p>River Plate knocked Ferro Carril Oeste off the rails with three goals in the first 22 minutes, two of them coming from Chilean striker Marcelo Salas, who controversially began the game against Juventus on the substitutes' bench.</p>
<p>Striker Ariel Ortega, who had opened the scoring for River in the third minute, added the fourth two minutes into the second half and Roberto Montserrat completed the scoring in the 69th minute to put River back on track for the title.</p>
<p>Lanus were left trailing the South American champions by two points and have only three games left against River's five.</p>
<p>Cesar Menotti's Independiente, who looked invincible at the outset of the tournament, are third, one point behind Lanus with three games left.</p>
<p>Boca, who spent $15 million on their team in their bid for the title, dropped to eighth place as they lost for the sixth time in 16 games.</p>
<p>Striker Julio Toresani put Boca ahead and then levelled the score in the 67th minute after Racing had taken a 2-1 lead through Sebastain Brusco and Marcelo Delgado.</p>
<p>But a 77th minute penalty converted by Claudio Marini followed by another goal three minutes later by the same player spelt more misery for Boca boss Carlos Bilardo, who lives under permanent threat of the sack.</p>
<p>Veteran defender Oscar Ruggeri, the former captain of the Argentina national team, scored the only goal in San Lorenzo's win over Velez Sarsfield.</p>
