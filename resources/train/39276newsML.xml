<p>Rising rivers sent deadly floodwaters over their banks and hundreds of thousands of battered East Coast homes remained without electricity on Saturday as residents mopped up after Hurricane Fran.</p>
<p>The storm was blamed for at least 19 deaths in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Most of the deaths were caused by the storm's heavy rains of up to 15 inches (37.5 cm) and flash floods rather than winds that gusted up to 120 miles (193 kph) when the hurricane hit land on Thursday, snapping power lines, tossing billboards and clogging streets with debris.</p>
<p>Powerful tidal surges wrecked buildings in beach communities and winds damaged towns far inland before Fran was downgraded to a tropical storm as it entered Virginia on Friday.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 people in the Carolinas and Virginia remained without power on Saturday.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton on Friday declared North Carolina and Virginia major disaster areas, making victims eligible for federal assistance, though the cost of the damage will not be known for days.</p>
<p>North Carolina faced a massive cleanup as coastal residents picked through wreckage and inland towns shovelled mud from flooded streets.</p>
<p>Water surged over low-lying barrier islands, filling the streets with sand, shredding ocean piers and washing some coastal homes hundreds of feet inland, officials said.</p>
<p>In Wilmington, a preliminary assessment indicated that one quarter of buildings in the city of 60,000 were heavily damaged, Mayor Don Betz said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the worst storm we've had in a long, long time,&quot; said North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt. In Raleigh, some 4,000 homes were declared uninhabitable because of severe flooding.</p>
<p>North Carolina officials confirmed 13 deaths linked to the storm, mostly from traffic accidents and fallen trees.</p>
<p>Virginia officials said the Shenandoah River continued to rise on Saturday, creating some of the most severe flooding of rural communities in years.</p>
<p>The north fork of the Shenandoah, which slices through Virginia's picturesque mountains and farming valleys, was expected to crest at more than 35 feet (10.6 metres) at Front Royal. The river overflows its banks at 15 feet (5 metres).</p>
<p>Near Washington, the Old Town district of historic Alexandria was evacuated on Friday as the Potomac River flooded streets with three feet (one metre) of water.</p>
<p>West Virginia Governor Gaston Caperton declared 12 counties disaster areas as heavy rain sent rivers, streams and creeks over their banks in the eastern part of the state.</p>
<p>Officials there said one man drowned in a creek and a second man died when his vehicle was swept away by floodwaters. In Virginia, a woman drowned when her four-wheel drive vehicle was overtaken by fast-rising waters.</p>
