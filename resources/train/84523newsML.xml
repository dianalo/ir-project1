<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Investors exit ADT options.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The collapse of a merger pact between Republic Industries Inc and ADT Ltd sent investors scurrying out of ADT options, traders said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Eighty percent (of the volume) is closing positions,&quot; a broker on the Chicago Board Options Exchange said, referring to ADT options.</p>
<p>He said most of the exiting was from arbitrageurs who were long positions in the 20 and the 17-1/2 strikes.</p>
<p>By 1215 CDT (1715 GMT), ADT shares in the U.S. were down 7/8 at 19 after falling to 18-5/8. About 4.15 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>The ADT October 20 call traded about 2,575 contracts compared to open interest of 4,960. The December 17-1/2 call traded 2,130 contracts. Its open interest was 870.</p>
<p>On the put side, the October 20 put traded 1,225 contracts. Its open interest was 4,745.</p>
<p>Other actives included the November 17-1/2 calls, the November 20 calls, the November 20 puts and the December 20 and March 20 calls.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially there was both buying and selling of calls and puts, but now there are a lot of calls offered,&quot; the broker said. &quot;It looks like they're hitting volatility a little bit.&quot;  </p>
<p>Volatility had popped to the 47 region from the low 40's off the opening but had declined back to normal levels by late morning, traders said..</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Republic and ADT said they jointly agreed to terminate their merger agreement because of recent stock uncertainty.</p>
<p>On July 1, the two companies announced the merger, which at the time was valued at about $5 billion. ADT shareholders were set to receive 0.92857 shares of Republic common stock for each share of ADT common. The exchange ratio was based on a price of $26 per share of ADT common.  </p>
<p>The termination of the deal boosted Republic shares, which were ahead 1-9/16 at 28-13/16. It reached 30-1/4 intraday.</p>
<p>Republic options, which trade on the CBOE and the American Stock Exchange, were thinly traded.</p>
<p>The most active Republic option was the October 27-1/2 put, which traded a total of 995 contracts. The option's open interest was about 2,100.</p>
<p>In other activity, a big roll was seen in options on Liposome Co Inc on the CBOE.</p>
<p>The Liposome February 1997 12-1/2 call traded about 4,500 contracts and the May 1997 17-1/2 call traded 6,750.  </p>
<p>&quot;They just rolled a position,&quot; a trader said. &quot;Basically the open interest moved from February to May.&quot;</p>
<p>Large spreads were seen in Allergan Inc options on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, where the October 35 call traded 5,000 contracts and the November 35 call traded 5,250.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like an in-the-money covered write being rolled over to pick up some premium,&quot; said Michael Schwartz at Oppenheimer, referring to the Allergan trades.</p>
<p>The premium on the October 35 call was 3-1/2 and the premium on the November 35 call was 4-3/8. --Gregory Crawford, 312-408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
