<headline>EU's Bonino says commission report &quot;unbalanced&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>European Commissioner Emma Bonino said on Monday that she thought an EU document due for release this week, which newspaper reports have said will show Italy outside a key single currency parameter, seemed unfair.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the document seems unbalanced. On Wednesday, we will need to look into the reasons which have led the experts to such an evaluation,&quot; the Social Affairs Commissioner, an Italian, told reporters in Rome.</p>
<p>The European Union's executive commission is due to release a document of official economic forecasts on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports have said that the EU document will show only Italy and Greece outside the key target of a three percent deficit to gross domestic product in 1997 required to join Europe's planned economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>An EU source has said Italy's deficit this year was forecast at 3.2 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not convinced by the sums,&quot; Bonino said on the fringe of a convention in Rome. She added that in Brussels &quot;there's a battle under way&quot;.</p>
<p>Bonino said constant leaks and reports were alarmist and unhelpful, and that there were difficulties for all EU states.</p>
<p>European countries will be judged next year on whether their economic performance is good enough for them to join EMU at its scheduled launch on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm told the International Monetary Fund forecasts a deficit-GDP ratio for Italy, France and Germany of 3.2-3.3 percent in 1997,&quot; Bonino said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not so blind I can't see that France is going to have early elections to push through an additional budget and the reason for (German Chancellor Helmut) Kohl's decision to stand again,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Chirac is due to make an television address later today, amid expectations he will call an early general election in May or June. Kohl announced recently he would seek re-election.</p>
