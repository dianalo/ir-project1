<p>Hilton Hotels Corp., the nation's largest hotel and gambling company, offered Monday to acquire ITT Corp. for $6.5 billion in cash and stock.</p>
<p>Including the assumption of debt, the deal is valued at $10.5 billion. In a letter to ITT, Hilton offered to pay $6.5 billion in cash and stock and assume $4 billion in debt, creating the world's largest lodging and gaming company.</p>
<p>ITT, owner of the Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars World Casinos, was not immediately available to comment on the unsolicited offer.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said the proposed deal could be a boon for Hilton.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a blockbuster of a deal and would make a tremendously strong lodging and gaming company,&quot; said Dennis Forst, financial analyst at Sutro &amp; Co. He said the $55 a share price would be a good buy for Hilton shareholders but ITT shareholders might want more given ITT shares had traded in the mid-60's back in August.</p>
<p>Because of the deal's size it might raise eyebrows of state gambling regulators and the Justice Department, Forst added.</p>
<p>In December, Hilton acquired Bally Entertainment Corp. for $3 billion.</p>
<p>Under terms of the ITT proposal, Hilton is offering to buy half of ITT's outstanding shares for $55 a share in cash and the other half for $55 a share in Hilton common stock.</p>
<p>The offer, which represents a 29 percent premium over ITT's current stock price around $42 a share, could be raised after a full review of ITT's operations, Hilton said.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of ITT and Hilton would bring together two of the world's leading lodging companies as well as two premier gaming businesses,&quot; Hilton Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hilton made the offer to ITT management in a phone conversation Monday. In a formal letter delivered later Hilton said it preferred to work with ITT management, but was prepared to try to unseat the ITT board if necessary to complete the deal.</p>
<p>ITT's operations include 415 hotels and 130,000 rooms. Its gambling business operates 14 casinos across the country. Hilton's hotel business includes 240 properties with 100,000 rooms. It also operates 16 casinos.</p>
<p>Hilton said it has entered into a side agreement with HFS Inc., a hotel franchisor and owner of the Avis rental car chain, under which it would license the Sheraton name and management agreements to HFS for HFS to operate.</p>
<p>Hilton estimated it could cut as much as $100 million in annual costs from the merged operations.</p>
<p>Bollenbach said ITT's return to shareholders has been &quot;disappointing&quot; when compared to the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 leading companies and to other comparable companies in the lodging industry.</p>
<p>He said Hilton would look at selling off non-strategic assets such as the New York Knicks professional basketball team and New York Rangers hockey team.</p>
<p>ITT currently has over a $3 billion capital expenditure program in place to update hotels and casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. A substantial portion of that program would be unnecessary if the two companies combined, Hilton said.</p>
<p>The stock of ITT jumped to $58 in after-hours trade from Monday's earlier close of $42.625. Hilton shares ended down 50 cents at $25.25.</p>
