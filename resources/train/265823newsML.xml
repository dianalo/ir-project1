<title>JAPAN: Japan money supply recovery intact - economists.</title>

<p>Japan's broadly defined money supply average of M2 plus certificates of deposit (M2+CDs) in November showed that money supply was continuing a gradual recovery, albeit at a slow pace, economists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>M2+CDs grew a preliminary 3.3 percent year-on-year in November, compared with growth of 3.7 percent in October, the Bank of Japan said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth rate of M2+CDs fell 0.4 percentage point in November, but a 2.0 percent month-on-month rise in the seasonally adjusted, annualised figure showed that a gradual recovery was intact,&quot; said Mamoru Yamaguchi, an economist at Nikko Research Centre.</p>
<p>Yamaguchi also said that money supply was boosted in November 1995 because investors had shifted a portion of their maturing funds to commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>&quot;If the impact of such a one-time factor is excluded, one could say money supply maintained roughly the same pace of growth in November as in recent months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Satoru Kado, a senior economist at Sanwa Research Institute, said weak bank lendings were holding money supply growth down.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow bank lendings are capping money supply growth. Large corporations are preferring to raise funds through corporate bond issues than bank loans,&quot; he said.</p>
