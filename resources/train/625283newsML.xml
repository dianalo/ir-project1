<p>A Middle East Airlines jet carrying 240 Lebanese nationals evacuated from Sierra Leone after a weekend military coup arrived in Beirut on Thursday.</p>
<p>Most of the passengers were women and children. The craft also carried the bodies of two Lebanese men killed by gunmen in the chaos on Sunday.</p>
<p>Billionaire businessman Jamil Saeed, who arrived on board the airliner that also carried the body of his 27-year-old son, fell to the ground after getting off the craft.</p>
<p>One woman said every Lebanese family was forced to pay the armed forces in Sierra Leone $2,000.</p>
<p>&quot;Our shops, possessions and cars have been looted and all Lebanese shops have been emptied of all kinds of goods,&quot; the woman, who wished not to be identified, told reporters at the airport.</p>
<p>Many of the 2,000 Lebanese living in Sierra Leone, most of them businessmen, took shelter at the Lebanese embassy in Freetown, where they suffered shortages of food and water.</p>
<p>A woman who refused to be identified said that the status of some 500 Lebanese nationals living outside Freetown was unknown.</p>
<p>The coup, led by Major Johnny Paul Koromah, overthrew the elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</p>
<p>The evacuation of foreigners has taken on added urgency because of moves by Nigeria, backbone of a regional peacekeeping force, to reverse Sunday's coup.</p>
<p>Britain planned to begin evacuating its citizens and other Westeners from Sierra Leone on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mohamad Aziz, head of operations at Middle East Airlines, said negotiations were under way to send other airliners to evacuate more Lebanese.</p>
<p>&quot;If security is guaranteed, we will send another plane in 24 hours,&quot; Aziz said.</p>
