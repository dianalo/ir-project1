<title>SOUTH KOREA: LME copper extends rally in Asia on Escondida vote.</title>
<headline>LME copper extends rally in Asia on Escondida vote.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-04-24</dateline>

<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper slightly extended its current rally on Thursday in Asian trade on news union workers at Chile's Escondida copper mine had voted to continue their strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper prices seem to be firm today mainly due to the strike news at Chile's Escondida mine,&quot; a trader in Seoul said.</p>
<p>Three-month copper was trading at US$2,375 a tonne at 0300 GMT, up from the LME's close on Wednesday at $2,372.  </p>
<p>A union official at Escondida said early on Thursday morning that the workers had voted 131 to 127 to accept a company wage offer but the margin was not enough to end the dispute and the strike will continue.</p>
<p>The 358 unionised workers at Escondida began their industrial action on Friday to demand wage increases. The rest of the mine's 2,000-strong workforce has not joined the strike.</p>
<p>The 800,000-tonne-a year mine is owned by Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd and RTZ-CRA.</p>
<p>However, some traders shrugged off the Escondida news saying it has already been reflected in the copper market.  </p>
<p>&quot;Recent gains in copper prices have been backed by short-covering rather than the strike news at the Escondida mine,&quot; said a trader at a major commodity house in Seoul.</p>
<p>&quot;Some traders are believed to have large short positions and are said to be unwinding those positions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The benchmark cash/threes spread was bid up to $160 backwardation by Wednesday's close, up from $100 a day ago.</p>
<p>Some of the current tightness could be from players who rolled over short positions for three months to May from February when the backwardation widened out to $300 a tonne in late January, traders said.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, COMEX copper hit a six-week high which U.S. traders said was due to concerns over physical tightness and a clutch of potential supply problems.</p>
<p>In addition to Escondida, the Kennecott smelter in Utah will stop producing blister for another five weeks, and the United Steelworkers and Phelps Dodge appear no nearer to agreement on a new Chino mine labour deal ahead of meetings on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said aluminium prices on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) rose on Thursday due to overnight gains on the LME and support by strong copper prices.  </p>
<p>TOCOM's benchmark February aluminium contract rose to 209.0 yen per kg at 0530 GMT, up 1.5 yen from Wednesday's close of 207.5 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some hedge buying from trading houses in dull trading,&quot; said a trader at Japanese broker Okachi and Co Ltd.</p>
<p>LME broker Brandeis said in its daily report that three-month aluminium prices should continue to consolidate in a range between $1,580 and $1,625.</p>
<p>Nearby support was given by the 100-day moving average (MA) at $1,598 and nearby resistance was seen at the 30-day MA at $1,615.  </p>
<p>A trader with LG Futures said LME copper and aluminium stocks are expected to fall further later on Thursday. However, he did not estimate the size of the declines.</p>
