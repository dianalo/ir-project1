<title>SWEDEN: Sintercast yet to contact Morgan Grenfell.</title>
<headline>Sintercast yet to contact Morgan Grenfell.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1996-09-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Head of Swedish development company Sintercast on Tuesday said the company had been unable to contact Morgan Grenfell since revelations the investment bank may indirectly hold 57 percent of its A-series shares.</p>
<p>&quot;During the last few days it has been difficult to get an answer from Morgan Grenfell as their telephone lines are blocked by worried investors,&quot; Sintercast Managing Director Bertil Hagman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hagman, however, dismissed fears over the future of the company whose share price has plummeted since its links to one of the three Morgan Grenfell funds under investigation were made public.</p>
<p>Hagman said he was still hopeful for his company that has been a surprise speculative player on the Stockholm bourse in recent years.</p>
<p>The share price of the company, that is developing a system for casting car engine blocks, soared to a high of 550 crowns this summer.</p>
<p>At 1050 GMT Sintercast A-series shares were 20 crowns higher at 225 crowns after diving 75 crowns on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We see no reason to go out and make any comment on the falling stock price, especially as everyone knows what is going on,&quot; Hagman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our information now shows that the corporate focus remains and we hope that through this we could restore confidence on our own merits.&quot;</p>
<p>Sintercast earlier expressed enthusiasm that Deutsche Bank indirectly held a majority stake and Hagman said the situation, despite the fund debacle, was good for Sintercast.</p>
<p>&quot;Personally I think that this is one of the best things that could have happened to the company: a big owner which publicly declares its shareholding.&quot; Hagman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell are big owners with strong support and sound knowledge of industry and product development.</p>
<p>&quot;Contact between us and Morgan Grenfell has occurred during all the time of they were a big owner even if we did not know exactly how large their shareholding has been. They have been involved in development work and have even had contact with the car industry on our behalf.&quot;</p>
<p>Hagman did not think that the negative reaction by the market would increase pressure on the company to finish its technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We work untiringly and are hoping to be able to win back the sharemarket's confidence.&quot;</p>
