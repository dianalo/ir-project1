<title>USA: CSCE cocoa weaker but within range, volume light.</title>
<headline>CSCE cocoa weaker but within range, volume light.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>CSCE cocoa prices were weaker in listless dealings ahead of midday, hit by speculative selling and pressure on the nearby switch, traders said.</p>
<p>Light speculative selling took hold of the market from the outset, dealers said, with currency-related arbitrage on the back months accelerating the downtrend.</p>
<p>A move by operators to roll spot positions into second-month May ahead of March's delivery period also weighed on the market, they said. March goes into notice period on February 14, one month before its expiration.</p>
<p>&quot;People are looking to start rolling now that the spreads have stabilized a bit,&quot; said one broker. Scale-down buying by manufacturers and commission houses provided some support, he said.</p>
<p>At 1144 EST, March was $10 a tonne lower, at $1,306, having traded from $$1,303 to $1,314. May was $12 lower, at $1,336. Volume reached a scant 1,581 lots as of 1100 EST.</p>
<p>Technically, March would need to hold above $1,292-1,294 to avoid retesting the contract low of $1,259 set last week. To the upside, resistance was noted at today's highs of $1,314-1,316 and then at $1,323-1,327.</p>
