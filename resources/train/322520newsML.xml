<p>A more active demand for cotton has been noted on many markets, the latest Cotton Outlook report said.</p>
<p>It added in its January 17 issue that U.S. cotton had become more prominent amongst growths traded.</p>
<p>Some contracts had also been arranged in Central Asian while Indian styles had continued to dominate the &quot;coarse market&quot;. Business had also been observed in Australian and West African, it added.</p>
<p>New York futures were a little firmer. Some mills had been prepared to pay firm prices in order to secure quality and shipment requirements, the report said.</p>
<p>Despite a projected rise in U.S. exports, the United States Department of Agriculture increased its forecast of the end-of-season carryover in its January supply and demand appraisal, the report said.</p>
<p>Insect populations in the U.S. should be limited in advance of new crop planting by wintry weather across the U.S. cotton belt.</p>
<p>Insect pressures on Australia's cotton crop have also continued to be light, the report noted, but the crop development remains 10 days late after lower temperatures.</p>
<p>West European spinners reported generally favourable trading conditions, Cotton Outlook said. The strength of the U.S. dollar appeared to be a favourable influence on several EU textile markets, it added.</p>
<p>Pakistan's share of Far Eastern cotton yarn markets is under threat from Indian mills, while Chinese yarn and cloth export prices fell by 13 percent during 1996, the report said.</p>
