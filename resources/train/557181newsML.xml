<p>German politicians and industry on Friday kicked off a heated debate over the candidates for the top post at the telecommunications watchdog that will oversee the introduction of full competition in the sector next year.</p>
<p>Leading newspapers said the names of four candidates were being discussed for a job that observers fear will require walking a fine tight-rope between political pressures and economic forces demanding robust competition.</p>
<p>Whoever is picked to head the Regulatory Agency when it begins operating on January 1 will have the tough job of ensuring competition in an industry where monopoly Deutsche Telekom still controls over 90 percent of the market.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the government will continue to be Telekom's main shareholder until well into the next decade, so any move by the regulator to accelerate new competition could be frowned upon by budget-conscious politicians.</p>
<p>Highlighting these two poles, the two most promising candidates for the job appear to be Klaus-Dieter Scheuerle, a key aide to Post and Telecommunications Minister Wolfgang Boetsch, and Dieter Wolf, head of the Federal Cartel Office.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Council, made up of members of the upper and lower house of parliament, meets on May 12 and is expected to name a candidate. A final decision is not likely until June at the earliest, officials said.</p>
<p>Political sources said the Council could propose Arne Boernsen, a Social Democrat (SPD) who heads parliament's postal affairs committee and played a key role in winning SPD support for the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.</p>
<p>Boetsch is expected to name his protege Scheuerle, a 42-year-old Christian Democrat who has been the minister's right-hand man and head of the regulatory department at the Postal Ministry since 1995.</p>
<p>The daily Handelsblatt newspaper also mentioned Bernd Jaeger, a cable television industry lobbyist, as a potential candidate, but political sources in Bonn dismissed this suggestion as very unlikely.</p>
<p>According to German press reports, industry leans towards Wolf, preferring a candidate who is independent and able to set a high standard for the new agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether Boetsch's man brings the necessary independence, competence and authority to this top position is more than doubtful,&quot; the daily Die Welt newspaper said.</p>
<p>Wolf told Handelsblatt that he had not been approached by either Boetsch or Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt.</p>
<p>He was quoted by Die Welt as saying, &quot;I can only comment on this after someone has officially nominated me as a candidate.&quot;</p>
<p>Although he comes from government, the 62-year-old Wolf proved his independence when he tried to block the merger of bus maker Kaessbohrer with Mercedes-Benz AG. Rexrodt overruled him, approving the merger in 1995.</p>
<p>Wolf has years of experience in merger supervision in the Economics Ministry and has run the Cartel Office since 1992.</p>
<p>According to Die Welt, Telekom competitors O-Tel-O -- the joint venture of Veba and RWE -- Mannesmann , and Viag have already expressed their disapproval of Scheuerle as &quot;unsuited&quot; for the job.</p>
<p>But Mannesmann dismissed this claim.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not correct that Mannesmann has already rejected the CDU politician Klaus-Dieter Scheuerle as a possible candidate for president of the new Regulatory Agency,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
