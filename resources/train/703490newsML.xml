<p>The Australian government basked on Wednesday in the glow of a potential credit rating upgrade from an international ratings agency and signs of a pick-up in the recently flat retail and building sectors.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello said an upgrade in Australia's credit rating to the top AAA rating could occur in six months after Moody's Investors Service boosted the country's outlook because of steady fiscal policies and a prudent interest rate strategy.</p>
<p>He said the Moody's announcement together with figures showing a 2.9-percent rise in retail sales in May, after two months of falls, and a 2.2-percent rise in building approvals added up to &quot;a good news day for the Australian economy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Good retail trade, good building approvals, international recognition of our efforts in relation to the budget -- a gathering convergence of economic indicators which show a very positive outlook in relation to the Australian economy,&quot; Costello told reporters.</p>
<p>Australia was downgraded to Aa2 from AAA in the late 1980s, mainly due to its spiralling debt levels and current account deficit.</p>
<p>Moody's said on Wednesday that Australia had reduced its reliance on foreign debt and a ratings upgrade would depend on Australia further cutting its need for offshore funding.</p>
<p>Costello said the international recognition of the improved budget position would lead to a benign interest rate climate.</p>
<p>He refused to comment on interest rates, except to say that inflation was the key determinant of any rates decision.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia met for its monthly board meeting on Tuesday and the chance of a rate cut in July, which would be the fifth in a year, is seen as an even-money bet.</p>
<p>Economists said Wednesday's retail trade and building data, did not change the ratings outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, I don't think it really gives us the definitive answer we have been looking for,&quot; said Michael Blythe, senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
<p>The 2.9 percent jump in retail sales in May was the highest monthly rise since March 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail spending is only travelling along at a very moderate pace and is certainly not strong enough at this stage to preclude another rate reduction by the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia),&quot; said J.P. Morgan senior economist John Kyriakopoulos.</p>
<p>Citibank Australia chief economist Stephen Koukoulas said the retail sales were a bit stronger than they had forecast but noted that it followed two monthly falls.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't say the retail sector is booming yet. It is encouraging to see a bit of growth coming through but I think the best you could say is the worst is behind us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Economists said building approvals data appeared to overstate the strength of the housing market because they included approvals for construction of the Olympic Village for the 2000 Sydney Games.  </p>
