<headline>Taiwan plans August cabinet revamp, president says.</headline>

<p>Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday gave the first explicit deadline for a long-planned reshuffle of his cabinet, saying it would be completed on August 30.</p>
<p>&quot;We will complete the cabinet reshuffle at the end of August, on August 30, in order to implement the new (constitutional) reforms,&quot; Lee told Taiwan's constitutional assembly.</p>
<p>Lee gave no further details.</p>
<p>The shakeup was expected to come after the ruling Nationalist Party's August 23-27 congress.</p>
<p>Party sources have told Reuters that the Nationalists have settled on party insider Vincent Siew as their choice for premier or cabinet chief once Lien Chan, who was elected vice president on Lee's ticket in 1996, gives up the premiership post to pursue his presidential ambitions.</p>
<p>Siew has declined repeatedly to confirm or deny the many reports that he would be named premier.</p>
<p>Lien, under fire in recent months for a perceived breakdown of law and order, had said he would tender his resignation once key constitutional reforms were carried out in July.</p>
<p>The National Assembly, whose sole role is to revise the constitution, on Friday adopted key amendments that beef up the president's powers at the expense of parliament and all but junk a largely redundant provincial government.</p>
