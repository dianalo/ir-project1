<p>Recent fighting in the northeastern Afghan province of Badghis has displaced 36,000 people, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The fighting which is continuing in the province of Badghis has displaced more than 4,000 families (24,000 people) towards the city of Herat since October,&quot; says an ICRC document released in Kabul on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Following recent confrontations, 2,000 more families are newly in need. These families are dispersed in the province of Badghis and around the provincial capital Qala-e-Naw,&quot; says the document.</p>
<p>Forces of the purist Islamic Taleban, who hold Qala-e-Naw and Herat, are facing fighters loyal to the opposition alliance along a bitterly disputed front line that runs through the province of Badghis.</p>
<p>Despite frequent reports of heavy fighting in the area, with both sides launching attacks, there are no reliable reports of a change in the front line.</p>
<p>The document says that the ICRC and the Afghan Red Crescent Society have started registering and assisting the displaced.</p>
<p>&quot;The ICRC have started assistance for the displaced of Badghis. Two ICRC teams, in collaboration with the Afghan Red Crescent Society, have undertaken the registration of displaced families in need of aid. This aid, about 200 tonnes, consists of food, blankets and plastic sheeting,&quot; says the document.</p>
<p>It says that five trucks have already left Herat for Qala-e-Naw in anticipation of future distributions.</p>
<p>Recent reports from the United Nations refugee agency say there also have been significant numbers of people displaced by fighting in the mountainous central region of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The reports say that the displaced were fleeing over the mountains from fighting close to the Ghorband valley.</p>
<p>The Taleban, who captured Kabul on September 27, are trying to impose their strict form of Islam across the country and control 75 percent of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>They are fighting an opposition alliance comprised of forces of the ousted government, northern military leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum and Shi'ite Moslem leader Karim Khalili.</p>
