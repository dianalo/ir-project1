<title>USA: NYMEX electricity futures rise in moderate volume.</title>
<headline>NYMEX electricity futures rise in moderate volume.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures were trading higher in moderate volume under some pressure from anticipated spring and summer cooling demand, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Trade of the May power contracts as front months signalled a move away from the shoulder, or low-demand months, towards the head, or heavy-demand months when prices should trade higher, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were in the shoulder, now we're getting closer to the head,&quot; said one New York-based futures trader.</p>
<p>As of 1225 EST, May California Oregon Border (COB) was trading up 30 cents at $10.55 after exchanges as low as $10.30, while June COB was up 19 cents at $10.90 after reaching as low as $10.85 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>May Palo Verde (PV) was trading up 35 cents at $14.90 after reaching as low as $14.60, while June was up 60 cents at $16.20 from a low of $15.80 per MWh.</p>
<p>NYMEX said as of 1200 EST an estimated total of 33 COB and 83 PV contracts had traded.</p>
<p>As of 1235 EST, NYMEX May Henry Hub natural gas futures were trading down 0.4 cents at $1.88 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>In Western news, capacity on the Pacific Intertie power transmission system, which links the Northwest to Southern California, will be raised to 6,250 megawatts (MW) by this weekend, a spokesman for Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) said Wednesday.</p>
<p>BPA says it will be able to raise the Intertie capacity even without re-energizing the 500 KV John Day-Slatt line, although repairs to the line are also expected to be finished by Saturday.</p>
<p>Several generation plant outages continued in the U.S., including talk of an outage at the 750 MW unit 2 at the Navajo coal-fired power plant, although the status of the unit could not immediately be confirmed.</p>
<p>Southern California Edison said restart of the 1,070 MW unit 2 at the San Onofre nuclear power plant has been delayed by another week to April 1.</p>
<p>Also, the 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear plant in Washington will be shut Thursday, several weeks earlier than planned for maintenance due to ample hydropower in the region.</p>
<p>In the Northwest, temperatures would average near normal along the coast and about 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the extreme eastern area for the next several days.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, readings would run as much as nine degrees above normal in the northeast, but two to six degrees above normal through the rest of the region.</p>
<p>COB open interest for March 25 fell 66 to 3,628, while PV open interest fell 62 to 3,264, NYMEX said.</p>
