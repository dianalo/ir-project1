<p>UPDATE ON THE PHILIPPINE ECONOMY</p>
<p>Real GNP expanded by 7.1 percent in the first half of 1996. Economic growth was propelled by investments and exports which continued to respond favourably to an overall climate of financial stability and confidence as well as to opportunities being continuously created by economic liberalization and reform.</p>
<p>On an annual basis, investments to-date in real terms increased by nearly 10 persent from last year, the highest rate of increase since 1990 and bringing up total investment spending to more than 24 percent of GNP. Anyone visiting the Philippines today and observing the throbbing construction activities can readily appreciate this fact.</p>
<p>Our merchandise exports, growing at a very respectable 19 percent over the first half of 1996, is much stronger than export performance in most countries in our region over the same period -- better than in HongKong (4.3%), Singapore (10.7%), Taiwan (10.1%), Korea (12.2%), Malaysia (13.6%), Thailand (0.2%), and China (-7.1%).</p>
<p>A key factor sustaining rapid export growth is fresh investment in production facilities in response to the much improved business climate. Significantly, our exports of electronic components and machinery parts now account for 54 persent of total merchandise exports as these have steadily outperformed exports of primary products and low-technology manufactures. This means our exports are becoming less and less vulnerable to the vagaries of nature and of market demand.</p>
<p>At the same time, service exports continue to be strong with the major component, workers remittances, increasing to $3.5 billion, up by 57 percent compared with a year-ago. We think it is both broadly-based and job-creating. This can be seen in the respectable showing across many sectors: manufacturing (up by 6%), construction (up 8%), utilities (up 8%); and services (up 5%).</p>
<p>Agriculture has also recovered, growing by six percent in the first half of the year with the recovery of rice production. Reflecting the enchanced economic outlook, unemployment per a survey conducted in July is now expected at 7.7 percent compared with 8.8 percent last year.</p>
<p>			   -----------</p>
<p>THE QUESTION OF SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p>The question is often asked. How vulnerable is the economy to a financial crisis ? The key to our financial stability lies in our ability to maintain a prudent and vigilant stance of monetary and fiscal policies. We proved our resolve by promptly adjusting our monetary programme in response to the serious inflation challenges that loomed in late 1995 and early 1996.</p>
<p>Careful monetary management has paid off with the decline in inflation as we had predicted. After peaking at 11.8 percent in March, inflation has steadily dropped back to 7.9 percent in August. And yesterday, it was announced that inflation had dropped further to a remarkable 4.4 percent. The last time inflation was any lower was way back in 1987 when economic growth, however, was also much slower.</p>
<p>Declining inflation has made possible a further decline in interest rates. Currently, the bellwether 91-day Treasury bill rate is at 11.55 percent from a high of around 13 percent earlier this year.</p>
<p>Declining inflation has also paved the way for the issuance recently of a 10-year treasury bond at a fixed interest rate of about 15 percent. Therefore, the latest inflation figure will likely have further positive impact on interest rates.</p>
<p>Reflecting the confidence in the economy, capital inflows have remained very strong -- so strong that the overall balance of payments has already reached about $4.0 billion as of August, four times the surplus recorded over the same period last year. Consequently, our official foreign reserve holdings now total almost $11.5 billion, equivalent to 3.3 months imports of goods and services.  </p>
<p>The peso, not surprisingly, has achieved an unprecedented degree of stability. Over the last eight months, peso volatility has settled to within one half of one percent. Just three years ago, the peso was fluctuating by about 17 percent around the average. By reducing uncertainty, a stable peso has been a powerful stimulus to business activity.</p>
<p>However, I would like to emphasize, and I cannot emphasize this enough, that the peso is truly market-determined.</p>
<p>Day-by-Day the peso is being trade in deeper and more active markets. Perhaps not many of you know that the trading volume in our foreign exchange market has dramatically increased from just $180 million per month in 1991 prior to foreign exchange liberalization to about $130 million per day this year and still growing.</p>
<p>The unprecedented credibility of the peso is creating an international appetite for our currency. This can be seen in the snowballing of proposals from top foreign investment banks to lead-manage the issue abroad of peso denominated liabilities. This is an unequivocal vote of confidence by the market although we prefer to first study thoroughly the proposals in light of possible complications for monetary control and management.</p>
<p>Some have also been viewing with concern a growing trade deficit which widened to $7.1 billion as of July 1996.</p>
<p>However, I believe that careful analysis would show that the situation remains quite managegeable. What are the relevant considerations ?</p>
<p>First of all, our exports continue to demonstrate remarkable strength and resiliency contrary to allegations of possible loss of competitiveness.</p>
<p>Second, the rapid growth in imports primarily reflects investments that expand future productive capacity. Capital goods imports have been increasing by 35 percent annually. On the other hand, consumer goods imports account for only 11 percent of total imports. And that share would even be lower if temporary but heavy rice importations earlier this year is factored out.</p>
<p>Third, the trade deficit has been readily financed by workers remittances as well as voluntary private capital inflows. Remittances are now being more effectively captured by the banking system as a result of aggressive campaigning by banks overseas.</p>
<p>Fourth an unsustainable debt built-up has been avoided. Indeed, the external debt service ratio is now down to just 12.8 percent of exports of goods and services.</p>
<p>And fifth, we have been accumulating a comfortable cushion of foreign reserves as a first line of defence against any sharp and unexpected shift in market sentiment.</p>
<p>I believe it is now time that we learn to judge the Philippine economy on the basis of its legitimate performance and not by our own worst fears or our past disappointments.</p>

<p>OBSERVATIONS ON THE BANKING SYSTEM</p>
<p>I would like to end my update today with a brief report on the banking system. The combined impact of rapid economic growth, financial stability and liberalization has been a powerful tonic to the banking system.</p>
<p>Total resources are currently expanding at almost 38 percent per year while the number of banking offices are expanding significantly and bringing banking services closer to the public.</p>
<p>This is expected to have a very positive impact on domestic savings over time. We are following through with additional reforms, including increased minimum capitalization requirements, not only to encourage an efficient banking system but also a safe one.</p>
<p>We are only too aware how a crisis in the banking system can easily trigger an overall crisis in confidence.</p>
