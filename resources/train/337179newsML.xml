<p>Demand seemed insatiable for stocks of the four big banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are active in the banking sector because they expect to benefit from recent directive to banks to raise their capital base,&quot; one trader said.</p>

<p>Petroleum shares, usually the toast of the bourse, made token gains because a persistent fuel shortage in Lagos.</p>
<p>Mobil, National Oil and Texaco were each 15 kobo stronger at 55.00 naira, 52.15 naira and 38.15 naira, respectively.</p>
<p>Unipetrol, the highest priced stock on the Nigerian exchange finished 12 kobo higher at 66.00 naira.</p>
<p>The biggest losers were Nigerian Breweries, down 10 kobo at 16.40 naira and Ashaka Cement, 20 kobo lower at 14.20 naira.</p>
<p>Dwindling profitability cost Chemical and Allied Products four kobo at 4.55 naira but Tripple Gee, a computer paper company, dropped 10 kobo to 7.50 naira because investors felt it had reached its peak.</p>
