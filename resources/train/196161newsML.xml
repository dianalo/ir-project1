<p>A $300 million Russian mission to Mars ended in disaster just over a day after liftoff when its probe crashed into the South Pacific Ocean on Monday.</p>
<p>The stricken probe, which was carrying four canisters of deadly radioactive plutonium, sparked an emergency alert in Australia after a U.S. White House said it could come to earth north of the Australian capital Canberra.</p>
<p>But Australian officials said the remains of the craft, expected to have disintegrated in the intense heat of reentry into Earth's atmosphere, landed between Easter Island and the Chilean coast at about 8:30 p.m. EST (0130 GMT).</p>
<p>Russian space officials, who asked the United States to help trace the craft after they lost contact with it shortly after liftoff, said the plutonium was encased in small canisters designed to resist the impact of both re-entry and a crash.</p>
<p>The probe had failed to break out of Earth's orbit after it was launched from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan at 2048 GMT on Saturday.</p>
<p>Russian mission controllers said there had been a problem with the final booster designed to set it on course for Mars but that it would be some time before they pinned down the fault.</p>
<p>The scientists, who overcame the cash shortage dogging Russia's post-communist economy to launch what they said was a unique 10-month mission, were distraught.</p>
<p>&quot;We've put seven years work into this,&quot; said Nikolai Ivanov, head of the main operational group controlling the mission. &quot;I cannot begin to describe how it feels.&quot;</p>
<p>Yuri Milov, deputy director of the Russian Space Agency, estimated the cost of the mission, designed to seek out traces of life on Mars, at around $300 million.</p>
<p>Some 20 countries had invested $180 million in putting scientific equipment on board, he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Ivanov said he was convinced nothing could be salvaged, although U.S. officials had earlier said they could not tell how much of it would have survived. &quot;Most of it would have burnt up on re-entry, there would only be small pieces left,&quot; Ivanov said.</p>
<p>A Chilean naval officer said recovery was almost impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;This area has one of the deepest ocean floors in the world. Any kind of recovery, if it were possible, would be very, very tough,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard put the army and civil defence officials on alert after being warned by U.S. President Bill Clinton of the falling probe and its plutonium batteries.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials said later they were confident the batteries had survived intact and were now deep in the ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;Our operating assumption is that the plutonium...withstood re-entry and fell into the water fully encapsulated,&quot; said Department of Energy spokeswoman Carmen MacDougall.</p>
<p>Two 6.5-foot (2-metre) penetrators designed to ram into the surface of Mars and weighing 143 pounds (65 kilos) each, were also expected to survive re-entry.</p>
<p>The Russian probe had been due to reach Mars on Sept 12 next year. The failed mission was the second of three planned trips from Earth to Mars in just over a month.</p>
<p>The United States launched a robot voyage to Mars two weeks ago and a second mission will blast off on Dec. 2. All were tasked to check for signs of water on the distant planet -- a key clue to whether there was once life on Mars.</p>
<p>The Russian space mishap was the fourth in recent years. A U.S. space vehicle, Skylab, plunged to Earth over Western Australia in 1979 without causing damage and a Russian Cosmos satellite fell in an unhabited region of Canada in 1987.</p>
<p>In 1991 the Soviet space station Salyut 7 re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and the debris was believed to have landed in the Atlantic Ocean, though some pieces were reportedly found in Argentina.</p>
