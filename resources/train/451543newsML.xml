<headline>Tokyo Grain Exchange finds no evidence of payoffs.</headline>

<p>The Tokyo Grain Exchange (TGE) said on Tuesday its officials had not found any clear evidence of possible payoffs by Japanese commodity brokers to favoured Taiwanese clients.</p>
<p>But the TGE officials, just back from Taiwan, said they are continuing their investigation.</p>
<p>The exchange said it is strongly urging Japanese brokers to act in line with the rules in Taiwan and said they would step up cooperation with Taipei's regulatory authorities from now on.</p>
<p>&quot;We had meetings with Taipei branch managers of Japanese commodity brokers in Taipei, but have no clear evidence of possible payoffs at this stage,&quot; Kiyoshi Takanuma, manager of the TGE's research division, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Takanuma and another TGE official were sent to Taiwan last week as part of an investigation into possible payoffs by five Japanese brokers to favoured Taiwanese clients in order to get more business from the clients.</p>
<p>The five commodity brokers are Nihon Unicom Co, Tokyo General Co, Okato Shoji Co Ltd, Kobayashi Yoko Co Ltd and International Trading Co. They have not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Industry sources have said the suspicion may be directed at red bean contracts as Taiwanese orders for the contracts listed on the TGE surged last year.</p>
<p>&quot;During our meeting with the branch managers, we urged them to act in line with rules and try not to arouse suspicion. We also will have closer cooperation with Taiwan's SEC for exchanging various information,&quot; Takanuma said.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Ministry, which supervises the TGE, said it would take a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd like to wait for detailed reports from TGE on its probe,&quot; said Hideo Hayashi, director of its Commerce and Commodity Investment Division.</p>
