<p>A joint U.S.-Kazakh venture called Erem Aktobe is to build a gas-turbine power plant with annual capacity of 150 megawatts at an estimated cost of $80 million in Kazakhstan's north-western Aktyubinsk region, an official from the Kazakh presidential news service told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said President Nursultan Nazarbayev flew to the regional centre on Wednesday to take part in a ceremony at the start of construction of the plant which is to run on gas from the nearby Zhanazhol oil and gas field.</p>
<p>The project is being financed by the U.S. partner in the joint venture, New Century Holdings, which will get a 75 percent stake in the power plant.</p>
<p>New Century is a U.S. investment fund active in the Baltics and Eastern Europe and already holds stakes in a number of Russian telecoms and energy firms.</p>
<p>It will finance one half of Erem Aktobe's costs itself and has pledged to attract the rest in loans from a number of U.S. banks for terms of up to seven years, the news service said.</p>
<p>The Kazakh side in the venture, represented by companies TOO Invest Region and TOO Tsentralnaya AZS, will get a combined 25 percent stake in the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;The chance to build the plant was initially offered by the Kazakh government to Swiss-Swedish concern ABB AG but, unfortunately, it did not provide financing possibilities,&quot; Energy and Natural Resources Minister Viktor Khrapunov told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The equipment -- four energy blocks of around 40 megawatts each -- will be made by General Electric Co of the U.S.</p>
<p>The first block will start up by the end of this year, the news service said.</p>
<p>At around the same time, the first part of the neighbouring Zhanazhol gas-turbine power plant with annual capacity of 48 megawatts will be launched.</p>
<p>This station is being built with the help of the local Aktyubinskneft oil company. The cost of the project is $11.1 million.</p>
<p>Kazakh officials have said previously that building gas-turbine energy plants in Aktyubinsk was a priority because of the lack of electricity in the region and its isolation from other energy systems in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to achieve energy independence in the republic's north-west, which is still dependent on Russian electricity producers,&quot; Khrapunov said.</p>
