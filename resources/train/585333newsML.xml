<headline>US mortgage-backeds a touch higher with Treasuries.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-15</dateline>

<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities meandered higher in thin trading Thursday, market experts said.</p>
<p>Spreads over Treasuries were wider at midday but slightly tighter by late afternoon, when Treasuries gave up some of their earlier gains.</p>
<p>Pass-throughs were 1/32 to 4/32 higher, with activity concentraded in mid-range coupons, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;All I saw today was a decent seller of Ginnie 8.0s,&quot; said one trader at a large bank.  </p>
<p>In late trading, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent paper was up 5/32 at 99-19/32, yielding 99 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.</p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae issues were up 3/32 at 99-18/32, and Freddie Macs were up 4/32 at 99-26/32.</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury note was up 1/32 at 6.67 percent.</p>
<p>U.S. fixed-income markets got off to a rocky start after reports showed core consumer prices were up 0.3 percent, a tick higher than expected, and weekly jobless claims posted a significant decline.  </p>
<p>But the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's business outlook index, released at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT, read 1.6 in May against 5.7 in April. Economists had projected an index reading of 7.4.</p>
