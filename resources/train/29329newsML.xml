<p>About 80,000 people have been killed in fighting in breakaway Chechnya, Russian security chief Alexander Lebed said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;One may say that about 80,000 people have died, plus or minus 10,000,&quot; Lebed told a news conference. &quot;Accordingly there are three times as many injured.&quot;  </p>
<p>There have been few official casualty figures for the conflict in the Caucasus region, which started in December 1994, when Russia sent troops into the region to crush an independence bid and there was no way to confirm Lebed's figure.</p>
<p>Fighting in Chechnya died down last month after Lebed signed a ceasefire deal with the separatists, followed by a political agreement signed last weekend.</p>
<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin backed Lebed's peace deal publicly on Tuesday, although he said there were still some grounds for concern.</p>
