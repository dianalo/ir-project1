<p>Greek shares powered ahead 2.16 percent on Wednesday amidst a widespread mood of optimism following the announcement of the price range for OTE telecom's part-flotation which ends June 13.</p>
<p>&quot;The announced price range added life to the market because it provided evidence of keen interest by foreign institutionals,&quot; said Petros Parisis, a broker at Nuntius Securities.</p>
<p>OTE's shares will be offered at 6,200-6,900 drachmas per share in the institutional book-building with the public offering to retail investors set at 6,000-6,700 drachmas per share.</p>
<p>The Greek state, currently owner of 92.43 percent of OTE's stock, offers a total of 45 million shares --10.7 percent-- but may fork out another 2.1 million shares, depending on demand conditions.</p>
<p>Global co-ordinators may also allocate an extra 6.33 million shares at their discretion.</p>
<p>The market reported clear demand for shares of OTE which jumped 4.86 percent to 7,450 drachmas.</p>
<p>Brokers said this was related to OTE's corporate moves and expectations of satisfactory domestic demand for the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;A strong show in OTE shares today may be attributed to improved prospects following the deal in Serbia which expands the scope for growth after the monopoly in Greece is removed in year 2000,&quot; said Parisis.</p>
<p>OTE signed a deal on Monday to acquire 20 percent of New Serbia's PTT and an equal percentage in a GSM operator in that country for 675 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;Increased demand stems from investors who wish to top up their allocation from the part-float which will be sliced by oversubscription,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Banks and industrial blue chips recovered some of the ground lost in recent sessions and brokers attributed this to fading selling pressure to raise cash for OTE's part-float.</p>
<p>&quot;Cashing-in on blue chips to raise liquidity which will be channeled to OTE's part-flotation has wound down because investors run out of time as the offering ends June 13,&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>Trading in OTE's cum-rights shares got more active as investors rushed to benefit from the 16 percent discount offered at the forthcoming rights issue, the broker added.</p>
<p>Following part-flotation, OTE will tap the market for a 7.5 percent rights issue of 31.6 million shares at a 16 percent discount to its June 13 closing price, rounded to the nearest 100 drachmas.</p>
<p>The Athens general index firmed 2.16 percent or 34.72 points to 1,638.56 from Tuesday's 1,603.84, helped by late-minute buying in OTE.</p>
<p>Turnover amounted to 23.0 billion drachmas on volume of 5.65 million shares, including several blocks in shares of Ergobank and Titan Cement.</p>
<p>Banks firmed 1.92 percent with most other sectors climbing higher.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks beat decliners 158 to 64 with 19 shares unchanged on 241 traded.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted at 1,120-1,150 drachmas. Shares of OTE telecom, the underlying, added 345 drachmas to 7,450.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch American call warrant on a basket of 23 Greek equities that are part of the Athens general index was quoted higher at 665.93-708.44 drachmas. The warrants expire January 9 1998. The ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted higher at $81.31-$83.01. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997.</p>
<p>The ING Baring Financial Products American-style call warrant on a basket of six blue-chips denominated in drachmas was quoted higher at 4,135-4,367 drachmas. The strike price is set at 10,000 drachmas and the warrants expire on February 2, 1998.</p>
<p>The ING Baring American-style second call warrant on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted higher at $16.57-N/O. The strike price is set at $110.0 and the warrants expire April 9 1998.</p>
<p>The recently launched ING Baring American-style, drachma- denominated call warrant on the bourse's benchmark index was quoted higher at 266-299 drachmas. The strike price is set at 1,639 points and the warrants expire May 14 1998.</p>
