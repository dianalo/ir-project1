<p>Belgian OLO market players said on Tuesday they were pinning their hopes on a fresh batch of U.S. data at the end of the week and potential major trouble for EMU next week for a possible revival of business.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still a market for market makers. Professionals and clients are just not interested,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Business is mainly spread-trading,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the prospect of key U.S. retail sales and PPI on Thursday and Friday respectively might inject fresh impetus in the market and the EU summit in Amsterdam next week also had potential to shake markets, he said.  </p>
<p>Business in OLOs was aimed at 10 and five-year paper, mainly OLOs 24, 26, 21 and 25, but the long end was ignored and the OLO yield curve remained virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>The OLO exchange auction in early afternoon, which totalled 12.21 billion francs, was described as a non-event which failed to inspire the market to greater things.</p>
<p>&quot;Conditions were not exactly excellent, to say the least,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The 10-year OLO/Bund yield spread was moving around in the eight to 10 basis points range but dealers were adamant it would not widen further.  </p>
<p>OLOs, which had been steady with a higher bias for most of the day, notched up more serious gains in late trading on the back of a stronger U.S. market.</p>
<p>The benchmark 2007 OLO yielded 5.85 percent compared with 5.88 in early business and the close on Monday.</p>
