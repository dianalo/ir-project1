<p>Adelaide Bank Ltd said on Thursday that it had cut its expense to income ratio to 62.14 percent by the end of 1996 from 65.4 percent at the end of 1994 and expected to cut it to 60 percent by the end of the current year to June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This ratio is on track to reduce to 60 percent by the end of 1996/97,&quot; Adelaide Bank said after posting its first half results.</p>
<p>Adelaide Bank's net profit rose 7.6 percent to A$12.91 million, despite a fall in operating revenue to A$150.80 million from A$160.84 million in the previous corresponding half.  </p>
<p>Adelaide Bank also set a 13 cents per share dividend, unchanged from the first half. This represented a 71 percent payout ratio, down from 74 percent in the 1995/96 year.</p>
<p>Adelaide Bank Chairman Richard Fidock said the bank had put in a very sound performance in the first half, which usually returned slightly lower profits than the second half.</p>
<p>He said the return on sharholder funds was 14.63 percent, up slightly on the 14.53 percent posted a year earlier.  </p>
<p>&quot;Importantly, the 71 percent dividend payout ratio attained for the first half of 1996/97 is in line with the bank's stated objective of moving into line with the banking industry peer group of around 70 percent,&quot; Fidock said.</p>
<p>Overall, Adelaide Bank's approved lending and finance worth A$537 million in the first half of the year, up 54 percent on the A$348 million for the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Adelaide Bank's shares were unchanged at A$4.46 at 1.45 p.m. (0245 GMT).</p>
