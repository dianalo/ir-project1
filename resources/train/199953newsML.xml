<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. crudes continued to soar late Tuesday riding a wave of bullish sentiment driven by short coverings and confirmation of a draw in crude stocks in the latest American Petroleum Institute (API) data.</p>
<p>December West Texas Intermediate/Cushing climbed to 24.45-55 a barrel, up a bullish 61 cents from Monday's late cash market.</p>
<p>The Dec/Jan WTI spread widened to around 30 cents, up 10 cents from Monday. That pumped up activity in WTI/Cushing Posting Plus, which traded in a wide range of $1.93-99, up about five cents.  </p>
<p>Domestic grades were mixed. Louisiana Light Sweet/St James broke through a $1 premium over WTI, with two deals confirmed at $1.01/1.02 a barrel.</p>
<p>Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire was confirmed traded at 84/85/88 cts over the WTI, up a few pennies from Monday.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI also gained some ground, changing hands at 6/7 cts, traders said.</p>
<p>Refiners have been showing a strong appetite for sweet grades lately because of the closed trans-Atlantic arbitrage, but some traders are speculating that foreign crudes could become more attractive with LLS pushing past $1.</p>
<p>One Gulf Coast refiner picked up a delivered Brent cargo in a confidental deal Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sours continued to languish on fundamental pressures. West Texas Sour/Midland weakened slightly to WTI minus $1.78-1.74, with one deal confirmed at $1.75. Eugene Island traded at WTI minus $1.15 and $1.16, about steady with Monday.</p>
