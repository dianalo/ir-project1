<p>Indian edible oil prices have eased on sustained import arrivals and a dip in demand in the summer months, but would firm when local supplies started drying up from June, industry officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said Indian importers had contracted huge quantities of edible oil last month after domestic prices shot up. This, coupled with a fall in local demand due to the arrival of summer, had sharply affected prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Edible oil prices have come down drastically in the last 10 days due to excess arrival of imported oil,&quot; O.P. Goenka, a senior official at the Central Organisation for Oil Industry and Trade (COOIT), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Local demand has also fallen as demand for fried food is normally lower during thte summer period. But prices will start firming from June onwards when domestic arrivals fall.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said palm olein oil was quoted at about 28,000 ($782) rupees per tonne in the local markets, against about 29,500 rupees a fortnight ago. Ground nut oil was quoted at 36,000 rupees per tonne compared with 37,500 rupees 15 days ago.  </p>
<p>Industry officials said Indian importers had contracted for about 600,000 tonnes of edible oil since the beginning of the 1996/97 (Nov-Oct) season.</p>
<p>&quot;About 70,000 tonnes of palm olein imports from Malaysia were committed last month,&quot; said Navinbhai Shah, president of the Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;In another four to six weeks, I expect import arrivals of about 150,000 tonnes,&quot; Shah added. India normally imports about 55,000 tonnes to 75,000 tonnes of edible oil per month.</p>
<p>Shah said the imports include palm olein oil from Malaysia, sunflower oil from the United States and Argentina, and soybean oil from South America.</p>
<p>India imported about 1.25 million tonnes of edible oil in the 1995/96 season. COOIT officials expect imports to rise to about 1.5 million tonnes in the current season due to rising consumption and disposable incomes.</p>
<p>Shah said palm olein imports were contracted at $600 per tonne FOB at Malaysian ports. Sunflower oil (crude) imports were quoted at $575 per tonne C&amp;F at Indian ports, and soybean oil imports were quoted at $575 per tonne at Indian ports.  </p>
<p>Industry officials said domestic demand had also dipped as retail buyers, aware of growing supplies due to huge imports, were expecting prices to fall further.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is lower as buyers are waiting for prices to fall further before resuming buying,&quot; Shah said.</p>
<p>Industry officials said the domestic summer crop had been harvested completely, but arrivals were not &quot;as good as earlier anticipated&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic arrivals were poor. The market is depending on imports,&quot; Shah said. About 200 tonnes of domestc edible oil was arriving in the Bombay markets per day, he added.</p>
<p>COOIT officials expect the 1996/97 oilseeds crop to be around 21.26 million tonnes, up from 20.98 million in the previous season. Summer output was expected to be about 9.35 million tonnes, down from 9.55 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>India harvests two oilseeds crops annually, with the bulk of its output coming from the winter crop. The winter crop is sown in July and harvested from October.</p>
