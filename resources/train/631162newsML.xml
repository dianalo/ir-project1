<p>European Union foreign ministers expressed concern on Monday over reports of human rights abuses in Zaire, and warned the bloc would keep close tabs on the country's progress towards democracy.</p>
<p>In a statement released five days after Laurent Kabila took over as president of the newly renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, the EU Council of Ministers &quot;expressed its extreme concern over the reports with regard to human rights violations, particularly in the eastern Congo...&quot;</p>
<p>The ministers called for access for the United Nations and humanitarian agencies to carry out work locating and helping refugees and to &quot;give them unhindered and secure access to all the regions they want to visit.&quot;</p>
<p>Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo said that the EU envisaged sending a ministerial mission to the central African country, although the time was not yet considered appropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;The present time does not seem to be the most appropriate juncture,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>The aim of the mission would be to assess the EU's future relations with the country, with which development aid has been suspended for some years, to see how the EU can help the democratic transition and what humanitarian aid it might offer.</p>
<p>The Union statement said it would support the country's process of democratic transition as it progresses and said the head of the EU's electoral unit was ready to visit the central African country in the near future.</p>
<p>On Sunday Kabila denied that refugees were being mistreated in his country.</p>
<p>Kabila, whose Alliance of Democratic forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) entered Kinshasa on May 17 after a seven-month civil war, took office on Thursday after according himself sweeping powers and banning political activity.</p>
