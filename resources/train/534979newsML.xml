<p>Strong quarterly earnings propelled selected shares higher in some industry sectors on Thursday in active trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;I think earnings has been a big push,&quot; said ScotiaMcLeod Senior Vice-President Fred Ketchen.</p>
<p>Companies have benefited from low interest rates, Ketchen said.</p>
<p>&quot;A couple of companies that have had good numbers are doing okay,&quot; said Calgary-based portfolio manager Josef Schachter.</p>
<p>Canadian National Railway Co jumped 2.90 to 52.60 and was among Toronto's top gainers, after reporting a first- quarter profit of C$1.51 a share on Thursday, versus year earlier C$0.92.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Paul Tellier forecast a lower operating ratio for 1997, which measures operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. A lower operating ratio means a stronger railway performance.</p>
<p>Fertilizer firm Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc rose 0.90 to 105.50. Despite a fall in first-quarter earnings to US$1.18 a share from US$1.40 last year, the firm posted its second highest quarterly income ever of US$56.4 million, Potash said.</p>
<p>Steelmaker Samuel Manu-Tech Inc climbed 1.75 to 19.75 after first-quarter earnings rose to C$0.42 a share from C$0.34.</p>
