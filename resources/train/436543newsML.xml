<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices stayed little changed Wednesday in quiet trade, with cooler Northeast weather and firmer crude underpinning the complex despite the lack of utility interest, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little cooler in the Northeast, but it's not really winter anymore. The story is still bearish, but we've come down pretty heavily, and we may just hang around here for a while,&quot; said one cash trader, adding utility burns were low.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent was still talked on either side of $15 a barrel, with prompt barges quoted about a quarter higher, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH April one percent paper edged into the low-$15 area, up almost a quarter on firmer crude.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour also stayed little changed at about $16.75, with relatively cheap East Coast city gate gas prices still trimming utility fuel requirements.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas gained a few cents Wednesday to the low-to-mid $2.20s/mmBtu, or about a $14.05 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, was up a similar amount to the mid-$1.90s/mmBtu, or $12.29 a barrel.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York notionally were steady to up slightly.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent firmed a quarter to near the $14 level, helped by reports a Florida utility one percent tender was awarded at $15.80 (120,000 barrels delivered).</p>
<p>No NYH deals were reported.</p>
