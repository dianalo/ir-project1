<headline>Andrews offers to buy 80.1 pct of Marvel.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Andrews Group Inc said on Tuesday it is offering to buy 80.1 percent of Marvel Entertainment Group Inc's common stock for $350 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition, which is conditioned upon Marvel affiliate Toy Biz Inc becoming a Marvel subsidiary, would be paid for in cash, Toy Biz common stock, or a combination of both at the option of Andrews Group, Andrews said.</p>
<p>Andrews last month agreed to acquire a substantial stake in Toy Biz.  </p>
<p>Andrews, which is controlled by financier Ronald Perelman, already holds about 80.2 percent of the common stock of the Marvel.  Perelman would maintain his stake in this deal, which would involve the issuance of 410 million new Marvel shares, a spokesman for Andrews said.</p>
<p>There are currently a little more than 100 million outstanding shares of Marvel stock, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Andrews had agreed to buy 67 percent of Toy Biz's class A common Stock in October from Isaac Perlmutter and Avi Arad, the Andrews spokesman said. Marvel currently holds all of Toy Biz's Class B common stock.  </p>
<p>Andrews said consummation of the Marvel deal would require certain consents under and amendments to the Marvel credit agreements, which would allow Marvel to increase its borrowing capacity.</p>
<p>Marvel, a maker of trading cards and comic books, said earlier today that it failed to satisfy certain financial covenants in its credit agreements and that it is seeking waivers of these covenants.  </p>
<p>The Andrews investment in Marvel is subject to the satisfactory resolution of Marvel debt-related issues, including that Andrews common stock in Marvel not be subject to liens, Andrews said.</p>
<p>Andrews said its investment would provide Marvel with &quot;desperately-needed liquidity and financial flexibility&quot; that would be &quot;essential&quot; for Marvel to resolve its financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Andrews said Marvel has formed a special committee of independent directors to review the proposal.</p>
