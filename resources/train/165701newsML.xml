<p>Scott Quinnell looks certain to be missing from the international arena this season after breaking off financial negotiations with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Richmond number eight's move effectively rules him out of the one-off tests against Australia and South Africa next month and probably the Five Nations championship as well.</p>
<p>&quot;We are resigned to the fact that Scott will not play international rugby this season,&quot; said Quinnell's agent, Mike Burton.</p>
<p>Quinnell, who won nine caps for Wales in 1993 and 1994, has been in dispute with the WRU over payment since returning to rugby union at the start of the season after a successful spell in rugby league with Wigan. He was not considered for the recent tests against France and Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;I had accepted their latest offer, even though it was still some way short of the financial package being offered to players currently playing for Welsh clubs,&quot; said Quinnell.</p>
<p>&quot;I was prepared to make that sacrifice to wear the red jersey again, but this latest turnabout by the WRU is most distressing.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel sorry for the other lads playing their club rugby in England because they are being asked to accept so much less than Wales-based players who will be wearing the same jersey on match day.&quot;</p>
<p>Burton stressed, though, that Quinnell would still be in with a good chance of making the British Lions party which tours South Africa in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I have talked to Fran Cotton, manager of the Lions for next summer's tour to South Africa, and he is quite prepared to assess Scott on his club form when considering his party to take on the Springboks,&quot; he said.</p>
