<p>Progress was made in talks between the EU and the United States on Monday on the transatlantic row over the Helms-Burton Act but several hurdles remain before a solution can be found, an EU official said.</p>
<p>European Union Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and U.S. Under-Secretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat met for several hours to discuss the controversial issue.</p>
<p>&quot;It was long, detailed, thorough and constructive,&quot; said Peter Guilford, the spokesman of Brittan. &quot;They made some progress but they did not solve the problems and there are many hurdles left.&quot;</p>
<p>Some new ideas were floated during the meeting and a group of EU officials would travel to Washington in the next few days, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you can interpret it as a positive or a negative sign. It is a sign that we are continuing talking,&quot; he said. &quot;So no breakdown, no breakthrough is how I put it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Helms-Burton act -- a culmination of years of U.S. policy aimed at isolating the Cuban government of Fidel Castro -- was passed last year to a chorus of indignation from the EU and other American allies.</p>
<p>Among other things, it allows naturalised Americans to sue in U.S. courts any foreign companies and individuals deemed to have gained from investments in property confiscated by the Cuban government since the communist revolution of 1959.</p>
<p>Although this section of the legislation has twice been suspended by President Bill Clinton, the EU is also opposed to another part which prohibits foreigners with links to companies investing in confiscated property from entering the U.S.</p>
<p>In February, WTO (World Trade Organisation) chief Renato Ruggiero named a panel to adjudicate on the matter, but Washington said it would not cooperate and reserved its right to invoke the little-used &quot;national security clause&quot; in its defence.</p>
<p>Last month, Brittan told EU foreign ministers that the U.S. intended invoking that right a soon as the EU submitted its case to the panel.</p>
<p>Guilford declined to comment on whether Eizenstat had raised this issue during Monday's meeting.</p>
<p>The first pleading was likely to take place in two to three weeks' time, he said. &quot;But in parallel to that process, to that dispute, we are negotiating with Mr Eizenstat.&quot;</p>
