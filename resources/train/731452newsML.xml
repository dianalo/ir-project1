<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday ordered Ohio Edison Co and Centerior Energy Corp either to revise their merger plan or face an agency hearing to address the commission's concerns about market concentration.</p>
<p>The companies last year announced plans to form a holding company, FirstEnergy Corp, which had been expected to become the nation's 11th largest U.S. investor-owned electric system.  </p>
<p>The commission said the two utilities had understated their ability to dominate Ohio and western Pennsylvania once they merge their power generation and transmission capacity.</p>
<p>FERC criticized the economic assumptions that the companies had used to assess whether competing energy suppliers would have access to their transmission lines.</p>
<p>To avoid an agency hearing, the commission suggested four ways that Ohio Edison and Centerior could resolve the market concentration issues. The companies could sell some power plants, allocate some transmission capacity to other suppliers, or expand their transmission systems.</p>
<p>FERC also suggested that Ohio Edison and Centerior could create an independent system operator to run the combined transmission system. Commissioner Donald Santa said that the creation of an independent system operator alone might not resolve all the commission's concerns about concentration.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have to be an awfully strong ISO in order to address our concerns,&quot; he said at the commission meeting.</p>
<p>If the two companies chose instead to face an agency hearing before an administrative law judge, the utilities would have to prove why their economic and market concentration assumptions were correct.</p>
