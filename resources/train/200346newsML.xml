<title>PAKISTAN: Pakistan receives bids for palm olein tender.</title>
<headline>Pakistan receives bids for palm olein tender.</headline>

<p>The state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) received five bids C &amp; F on Tuesday in response to its tender for 2,000 to 4,000 tonnes of RBD palm olein for shipment by December 20, traders said.</p>
<p>They said all five bids were for 4,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>A trader, who asked not to be named, said Qulei Edible Oil of Malaysia was the lowest bidder at $577.93 per tonne C &amp; F.</p>
<p>He said Cargil had offered $578.25, Felda $579, Ngo Chew Hong $579.69 and Pan Century $578.40 a tonne.</p>
<p>An official of the TCP, which issued the tender on behalf of the state-run Ghee Corporation of Pakistan (GCP), had earlier said the TCP would only be interested in rates quoted below $557 per tonne FOB.</p>
<p>The trader said the C &amp; F rates quoted were very competitive, given that FOB rates quoted in Kuala Lumpur were around $515.</p>
<p>The TCP scrapped tenders for 2,000 tonnes of RBD palm olein last Thursday after receiving bids at $571 per tonne and $568.70 per tonne -- prices it considered too high, traders said.</p>
<p>The TCP bought 4,500 tonnes of RBD palmoil the same day at a C &amp; F rate of $529.40 per tonne from Pan Century for shipment by December 10.</p>
