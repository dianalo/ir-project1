<headline>US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK -- Greenspan up at bat.</headline>

<p>U.S. government securities investors will sit in the stands for much of Tuesday, waiting for the financial markets' arguably most valuable player -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- to step up to bat.</p>
<p>Greenspan is scheduled to deliver his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to a House of Representatives subcommittee at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT on Tuesday and investors want to see if his remarks hit a home run for the financial markets, strike out, or do something in between.</p>
<p>Irrational exuberance, indeed.  </p>
<p>Two big issues loom, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Number one, what will Greenspan say about the Fed's view on inflation,&quot; said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;Will he hint that the Fed will be pre-emptive?&quot;</p>
<p>Moran said Greenspan would stop well short of the view that the economy is operating under a new set of circumstances that permits brisk economic growth without risking inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;He'll readily admit that some developments like international competition and productivity gains have restrained inflation,&quot; said Moran.  </p>
<p>&quot;But he will say that he has not let his guard down on inflation and that he remains skeptical about the ability of these factors to keep inflation in check when you have an economy at this stage of the business cycle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As to whether the Fed will be pre-emptive or not, Greenspan will be less forceful than in the past, said Moran.</p>
<p>&quot;He's certainly going to say that they want to remain pre-emptive, but he's likely to say that we have to recognize that this businesss cycle is behaving differently from prevous ones and that you have to take that into account when shaping monetary policy,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>William Dudley, managing director and director of economic research at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., said Greenspan is likely to be less cautionary than he was during his February testimony &quot;because he probably doesn't anticipate the need to tighten anytime soon.</p>
<p>&quot;In February, he might have thought a tightening was near at hand,&quot; said Dudley. Indeed, the Fed hiked rates in March.</p>
<p>But neither is Greenspan likely to proclaim a brave new world of fast economic growth with no inflation risk, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan is not as much of a brave new world guy as some people would like to think,&quot; said Dudley.  </p>
<p>Another consideration is that the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony does not just consist of Greenspan's personal views, but represents the thinking of the Fed as an institution which might be even less ready than the Fed Chairman to recognize a new economic world, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors want to know Greenspan's views on stock prices and credit market spreads,&quot; said Dudley. &quot;They'll look to see if he's trying to take some of the buoyancy out of the financial markets. Also, investors want to hear how Greenspan characterizes the March rate tightening, from which they will try to infer whether there are more tightenings ahead.&quot;  </p>
<p>Dudley said the testimony is likely to be &quot;pretty Greenspan-esque which is pretty balanced and pretty opaque.</p>
<p>&quot;He won't say too much because he doesn't really know what he will do next,&quot; said Dudley. &quot;He's pretty agnostic about what the economy is going to do and about how much the world has changed. In that situation, it's best not to say too much in formal testimony.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said the Humphrey Hawkins testimony, scheduled for 1400 EDT, could cast a shadow over the Treasury's auction of $15.5 billion in two-year notes. The bidding deadline for that sale is one hour before the testimony.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be a difficult auction,&quot; said Moran. &quot;People will be bidding very cautiously on that.&quot;</p>
<p>In when-issued trade late Monday, the two-year notes to be sold on Tuesday were yielding 5.96 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers indicated that Federal funds would open at 5-1/2 percent on Tuesday.</p>
