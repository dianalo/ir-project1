<title>KENYA: Water shortage is in second week in Nairobi.</title>

<p>Kenya's capital is suffering a second week of water shortages, another blow to residents hit by power rationing and poor roads, consumer groups said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Francis Orago, executive director of the Kenya Consumers Organisation, said such small things eroded investor confidence and undermined economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate that up to 1.5 million of Nairobi's estimated 2.5 million population are affected by the current water crisis,&quot; Orago told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Worse still, even if the shortages were not there, Nairobi no longer has clean water,&quot; said Orago, adding consumers were asked to boil city water before drinking.</p>
<p>The shortage began last week when pipes burst at Sasumua in central Kenya at a dam supplying 40 percent of the city's water. Nairobi City Council said at the time it would take a week to repair.</p>
<p>City Council Deputy Town Clerk Judy Munyiri said a private company was working on the water problem and supplies should be restored by the weekend.</p>
<p>The Federation of Kenya Employers said its members were complaining.</p>
<p>&quot;People cannot shower or use house toilets. You have to travel for a distance to draw water by bucket,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;Company bosses have to pass through hotels to shower before proceeding to their offices. Too bad for everyone else.&quot;</p>
<p>Power has been rationed in Nairobi since November and authorities say that will continue until July.</p>
<p>Roads are in a poor state. Local government has launched a project to fill potholes, some in Nairobi's commercial district, and says it will take at least three years.</p>
