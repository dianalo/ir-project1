<p>A war of words has erupted between the daughter of Mexico's jailed former anti-drugs chief and Defence Minister Gen. Enrique Cervantes after she alleged on Monday the two men quarreled just before her father's arrest.</p>
<p>In a letter published on the front page of Mexico's Excelsior newspaper on Monday, Teresa de Jesus Gutierrez Ramirez took issue with a Defence Ministry statement on Sunday that denied there had been a dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to (the ministry's statement) that 'there was never a debate, and even less a quarrel, with (Cervantes),' I reiterate that there was indeed a debate and the Defence Minister himself ... knows it,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>Her father, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was imprisoned last month after spending just two months at the head of the National Institute for Combating Drugs (INCD), when the government alleged he had taken payoffs from the country's top drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes.</p>
<p>His arrest deeply disturbed both Mexico and the United States, and threatened to undermine anti-drug cooperation between the two nations.</p>
<p>Gutierrez's daughter, in an interview published on Saturday, told Excelsior the argument had been over a decision by Cervantes to suspend an operation that Gutierrez planned to carry out to capture Tijuana drug cartel leaders, the Arellano Felix brothers.</p>
<p>She said the aim was to hand over the captured drug suspects to U.S. officials on the border. The Defence Ministry said it had no knowledge of such a plan.</p>
<p>She quoted her father as shouting at Cervantes, after she says he had cancelled the mission: &quot;So why did you name me (to the post), to make an idiot of me? You can't do that to me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry statement said a meeting took place between Gutierrez and Cervantes on Feb. 6 in the presence of military officials, and Gutierrez was hospitalized afterward.</p>
<p>He was said to have suffered a heart attack after he was confronted with evidence of his suspected corruption at the meeting. He was taken to a hospital before his arrest on Feb. 18.</p>
