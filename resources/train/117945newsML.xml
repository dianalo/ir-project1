<p>Dutch Heidemij said on Tuesday the placement of 5.25 million new shares as part of its intended merger with engineering consultancy DHV was not expected to dilute earnings per share in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect earnings per share growth in 1997,&quot; Heidemij chairman Frans Luttemer told a news conference, adding the merger should be settled by the end of this year or early 1997.</p>
<p>Earlier today Heidemij said it was in talks with sector rival DHV on forging a fully-blown merger.</p>
<p>Heidemij's financial director Jan van den Ochtend told an investors' symposium in Amsterdam that Heidemij's takeover strategy was always based on improving earnings per share.</p>
<p>&quot;Our expectation -- but I cannot give any guarantees -- ... is that profits per share will increase from the very start (of the DHV takeover),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Given the 5.25 million new shares to be issued by Heidemij, DHV should generate annual net profit of about nine million guilders to prevent dilution of earnings per share, industry watchers calculate.</p>
<p>When asked, Van den Ochtend said he felt 'comfortable' with this estimate.</p>
<p>DHV posted first-half net profit of 1.6 million guilders. In 1995 the firm booked a loss of 17.2 million guilders.</p>
<p>This loss would have amounted to 2.2 million guilders excluding DHV's loss-making units in Spain and Britain. Both will be deconsolidated before the merger with Heidemij.</p>
<p>DHV's chairman Hans Huis in 't Veld said the firm had lost about 25 million guilders in Britain in the past few years and 25-30 million guilders in Spain in about four to five years.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the merger is completed, all problems will be completely solved,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 5.25 million new shares which will be issued as part of the merger will come on top of 18.7 million Heidemij shares already outstanding, of which 13.45 are listed in Amsterdam and U.S. screen bourse Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Shares in Heidemij gained 1.10 guilders to 18.50 by mid-afternoon in Amsterdam. Heidemij closed at $10 on Nasdaq before the merger talks were announced.</p>
<p>Heidemij's first-half 1996 profit rose to 12.4 million guilders from 12.2 million in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Luttemer said Heidemij was maintaining its earlier forecast for 1996 that profits would roughly be in line with 1995's 27 million guilders.</p>
<p>A condition of the takeover deal is that DHV will clear a 15 million guilder subordinated loan before the acquisition is finalised. Heidemij's strategy is based on expanding its European network and market position in U.S.</p>
<p>It wants to obtain footholds in South East Asia and Latin America, which areas should generate about 20 percent of group sales in five to 10 years. Profit margins should increase to some five percent from a current 3.5 percent.</p>
