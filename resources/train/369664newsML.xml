<p>Confident U.S. consumers helped retailers ring up strong sales increases in January, gains that are likely to keep the financial markets and the Federal Reserve on high alert against potential inflation pressures, economists predicted.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters offered an average forecast of a 0.7 percent increase in January retail sales in total, and a 0.6 percent rise when auto sales were excluded.</p>
<p>In December, retail sales rose 0.6 percent overall and 0.6 percent with auto transactions deleted.  </p>
<p>With labor markets tight, the picture shows &quot;all the things we've had in place for a while, but unless we get some significant (softening), the Fed will still be on alert for some inflation down the road,&quot; said Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co bond market analyst Lee Youngdahl.</p>
<p>Youngdahl said a strong January U.S. retail sales report on Thursday, February 13 -- the data are due at 0830 EST/1330 GMT -- would eventually lead to a turnaround in production &quot;and it all dovetails to a continued strong real rate of economic growth.&quot;  </p>
<p>Economists at Chase Securities Inc and at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co expect retail sales to be up a full percent.</p>
<p>At Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, economist Chris Rupkey forecasts retail sales at up 0.9 percent overall and up a more moderate 0.7 percent when auto sales were discarded.</p>
<p>&quot;Car sales were very strong and chain-store sales were fairly strong,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We already knew from GDP (Gross Domestic Product) that consumers were spending and the profile was that they spent more in November and in December than in October,&quot; said Rupkey. &quot;So there's a lot of momentum into the first quarter of this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Continued strength in consumer spending could mean a strong GDP report for the first quarter &quot;if exports don't squash it too much,&quot; said Rupkey.</p>
<p>First-quarter GDP growth of 3.0 percent would be bad for the credit markets; 2.5 percent would be good, Rupkey said.  </p>
<p>Daiwa Securities America Inc chief economist Michael Moran, forecasting a 0.7 pct retail sales gain and a 0.6 pct rise ex-autos, said the markets might not like that strength.</p>
<p>&quot;You might see the slightest of negative reactions to the data because, while it's not overwhelming growth, it leaves the clear impression that the household sector is doing well and that would brighten the outlook for the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Elliott Platt, managing director, economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, forecast a more subdued 0.5 percent retail sales gain and a 0.3 percent rise when auto sales are set aside.  </p>
<p>Platt said retail companies' January sales reports released on February 6 indicated &quot;a lot of strength&quot; in department store apparel sales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, at gasoline service stations for example, sales were slower, he said.</p>
<p>Another potential factor for the markets is the history of upward revisions to November and December retail sales data that sometimes accompanies the January sales data, said Platt.</p>
<p>&quot;Those upward revisions might be more significant to market reaction than the January data themselves,&quot; he said.</p>
