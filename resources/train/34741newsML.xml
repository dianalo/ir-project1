<title>TAIWAN: Daughter mum on China's ousted party chief Zhao.</title>
<headline>Daughter mum on China's ousted party chief Zhao.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1996-09-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>A daughter of China's disgraced Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, has dodged Taiwan reporters' questions about his seven years in political limbo, saying only that Zhao was healthy.</p>
<p>&quot;My father's health is good,&quot; Wang Yannan, a Beijing auction house executive who arrived in Taipei on Wednesday for a private visit, told the China Times newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything in my family is fine. Thank you,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old Wang, vice president of China Guardian Auctions Co Ltd, came to Taiwan for a three-day exhibition of Chinese art opening on September 6, a Taiwan organiser said.</p>
<p>As party general secretary in the late 1980s, Zhao was paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's hand-picked heir until he was toppled by party hardliners after the June 4, 1989 armed crackdown of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement.</p>
<p>Zhao, 77, fell within weeks of the crackdown, in which hundreds of protesters and some martial-law troops were killed. He was formally blamed for letting student-led protests spiral into a seditious &quot;counter-revolutionary rebellion.&quot;</p>
<p>Zhao has endured virtual house arrest in a leafy Beijing courtyard ever since, making only quiet outings to a suburban Beijing golf course and occasional trips to other provinces with top party approval.</p>
<p>Recent photographs leaked to the Western media have shown Zhao to be trim and in apparently good health, though his hair has thinned and gone completely white.</p>
<p>Zhao's daughter made clear that she would not shed light on his daily life, let alone his opinion of regular speculation that he yearns for a political comeback.</p>
<p>Was it possible, she was asked by a Taipei television reporter, for Zhao to return to politics?</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; replied Wang, who has used her husband's surname since her father's fall from power. &quot;I don't want to talk about this issue.&quot;</p>
<p>It is extremely rare for people linked to China's communist elite to travel to Nationalist-ruled Taiwan, which until the mid-1980s banned such visits.</p>
<p>Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalists were defeated by the Communists in 1949 and fled to the island.</p>
