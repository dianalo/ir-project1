<p>U.S. officials unveiled a redesigned $50 note on Thursday, saying several new security features would significantly reduce counterfeiting.</p>
<p>The new note, which follows a redesigned $100 note, will be issued in the fall, ultimately replacing all $46.5 billion in $50 notes currently in circulation.</p>
<p>&quot;Since its introduction, the new $100 bill has been extremely effective against counterfeiting and has been well received by the American people,&quot; said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin at the unveiling.</p>
<p>In the first year of its issuance, the new $100 note reduced counterfeiting to 1/18th of its previous volume, according to the U.S. Secret Service. The new note represents over one third of all $100 bills in circulation.</p>
<p>The new $50 note includes security features, including watermarks, microprinting and color-shifting ink that should greatly hamper counterfeiting efforts, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our currency is trusted and accepted by people throughout the world. Because of this special status, the protection of our currency from counterfeiting has long been a priority,&quot; said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
