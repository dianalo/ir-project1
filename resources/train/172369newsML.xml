<headline>Yeltsin health positive after surgery, doctors say.</headline>

<p>Doctors said on Thursday that President Boris Yeltsin was recovering normally from his heart operation and there were no problems, Itar-Tass news agency quoted a presidential spokesman as saying.</p>
<p>A team of doctors met for 90 minutes on Thursday morning to discuss his progress after Tuesday's operation. Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Tass the results were &quot;positive and there is nothing untoward&quot;.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said the doctors had consulted at the Cardiology Research Centre where the 65-year-old president had the quintuple bypass operation.</p>
<p>Tass did not make clear whether the doctors had seen Yeltsin or had just discussed the results of the operation.</p>
<p>The presidential press service declined to give further details, saying Yastrzhembsky would hold a news conference later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, said by doctors to be recovering surprisingly quickly, has asked to be moved to a more convenient clinic to convalesce. Yastrzhembsky did not say whether the doctors had agreed to his request.</p>
<p>Pioneering heart surgery expert Michael DeBakey, a consultant at the operation, said on Wednesday that Yeltsin could be back at work after six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Yeltsin hopes the surgery, intended to improve the flow of blood to his heart, will allow him to reassert full control in the Kremlin to deal with Russia's burning economic and political problems.</p>
