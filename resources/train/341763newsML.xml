<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) said on Wednesday it was keeping a close eye on the copper market, where a new squeeze evokes memories of the kind of gyrations that went on when Sumitomo Corp of Japan called the shots.</p>
<p>A South Korean firm, LG Metals Corp, which traders speculated was among those who were caught short, said in Seoul that it had neither requested an increase in LME credit lines nor received margin calls from any LME brokers.</p>
<p>The market is  very tight, with  nearby supply scarce and the backwardation - the premium over futures prices that must be paid for prompt delivery - soaring.</p>
<p>Big speculative shorts are having to pay high premiums to cover maturing positions which run up to the middle of February.</p>
<p>&quot;The Executive of the LME, as you would expect, is monitoring the copper market very closely at present... particularly against the background of the backwardation structure in the nearby dates,&quot; LME Chief Executive David King said.</p>
<p>Even though LME-supervised  warehouse stocks of copper are rising remorselessly, the immediate tightness shows no signs of dissipating - implying that someone, possibly a big European merchant house, has got control of a chunk of what is in the warehouses.</p>
<p>&quot;People do say that it (the tightness) could collapse, but it may get worse before it gets better,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>On the LME, the benchmark cash to three months backwardation slipped to $280 on Wednesday, having been as high as $335 on Tuesday - levels not seen since Sumitomo squeezed the market in May 1996 and December 1995.</p>
<p>Cash for one day touched $24, within a whisker of the LME'S limit of one percent of the previous day's cash price ($2,530).</p>
<p>Traders say that the current severe tightness is partly due to a sell-off in autumn 1996, when investment banks sold three months positions short, believing the market was set for a terminal decline.</p>
<p>But copper's resilience has defied expectations, with prices and premiums having soared, despite stocks rising from a 90,050-tonne nadir in November 1996 to the current 165,650 tonnes.</p>
<p>Some traders say the major long in the market -  supposedly the European merchant - is taking advantage of the situation, and that one of the players who got caught in the net is LG Metals Corp, a unit of South Korea's LG Group.</p>
<p>They suggested that loss-making short futures positions were perhaps having to be financed by granting of options, both current and forward, with the nearby ones up for declaration next week.</p>
<p>But Hong Seong-ho, team manager for aluminium and LME sales at the South Korean company, said on Wednesday that LG Metals copper shorts were a stocks carryover hedge, and that the firm had not requested increased LME credit lines or received margin calls from its brokers.</p>
<p>Also,  he was unaware whether LG Metals had received a letter from the LME, expressing concern about the company's operations.</p>
<p>Asked about these suggestions,  the LME's King said that &quot;I am not in a position to comment regarding the activities of LG Metals.&quot;</p>
<p>The current tightness in copper has, however, unsettled a market that only a few months was rocked by the scandal over Japan's Sumitomo.</p>
<p>Last June, Sumitomo fired its former head copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka, alleging he had admitted running up losses of $2.6 billion in unauthorised copper trading.</p>
<p>Prices tumbled on fears that a huge long position held by Hamanaka had to be unwound although, in the event, Sumitomo managed to get this done without too many other players being burned.</p>
