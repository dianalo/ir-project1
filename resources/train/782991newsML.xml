<text>
<p>Nassau and Suffolk Counties in New York State were expected to match the state's one-week break in September on clothing sales taxes on items that cost less than $100, according to Newsday's Wednesday edition.</p>
<p>The New York City Council has approved a bill to lift the city's four-percent tax on such items. The state, in its new 1998 budget, from September 1 to 7 will stop collecting sales taxes on clothing that sells for less than $100, along with the 0.25 percent tax paid to the state Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
<p>Shoppers in Nassau stand to save a total of 8.5 percent levy, while buyers in Suffolk will save 8.25 percent, Newsday said.</p>
<p>Nassau County's legislature at a session on Wednesday was expected to agree to lift its sales tax. Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney was expected to announce on Wednesday his support for lifting the county's share of the clothing sales taxes, the paper said.</p>
<p>Michael Cathers of the New York State Association of Counties told Newsday that the coming sales tax break was more difficult for county governments because it falls within the same fiscal year as a more generous one-week tax break offered last January. As a trial, the state and most localitites waived clothing sales taxes on items that cost under $500 during that period.</p>
