<p>At least 22 Sri Lankan soldiers and separatist rebels have died during clashes in the island's north and east, Defence Ministry and military officials in the area said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>More than 12 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were killed in an attack by government troops near Nedunkerni, 260 km (160 miles) northeast of Colombo, late on Monday, a Defence Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>Two soldiers were also killed in the battle, it said.</p>
<p>Government forces last month captured Nedunkerni, in the heart of the LTTE's northern Wanni stronghold, after a major offensive launched to open a supply route through the mostly shrub-covered Wanni.</p>
<p>Two deadly rebel attacks have since slowed the offensive.</p>
<p>A rebel ambush on an army patrol at Naddukudah near the northwestern coastal town of Mannar, 240 km (150 miles) from Colombo, left two soliders dead. Two rebels died when government troops retaliated, military officials said.</p>
<p>Two soldiers were killed by rebel gunfire while guarding farmers in rice fields at Arunapura in the Polonnaruwa district, 200 km (125 miles) northeast of Colombo, the Defence Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>In another incident, troops shot dead two LTTE women fighters in the former rebel northern stronghold of Jaffna, the statement added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police said they had arrested five suspected LTTE rebels in connection with the killing of a parliament deputy from a moderate ethnic Tamil political party over the weekend.</p>
<p>Arunasalam Thangathurai, a lawmaker from the Tamil United Liberation Front, and four others were killed in a grenade attack in the eastern port city of Trincomalee.</p>
<p>Fifteen others were wounded in the attack, which police blamed on the LTTE.</p>
<p>The LTTE are fighting a 13-year-old war for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
