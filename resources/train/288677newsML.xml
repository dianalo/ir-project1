<p>Wall Street stocks powered higher at midsession Monday as growing optimism about the U.S. economy boosted cyclical and technology stocks.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials were up 66 points to 6610 and the tech-studded Nasdaq Composite gained nine points to 1319.</p>
<p>&quot;Chemicals, computers and automobiles are all doing well,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. &quot;The message from the stock market is perhaps the economy is stronger than anyone had bargained for.&quot;  </p>
<p>The broad rally, which follows a Dow rise of better than 100 points last Friday, produced three advancing issues for every two decliners on heavy New York Stock Exchange volume of 215 million shares.</p>
<p>The market showed strength despite a lackluster bond market, where interest rates have recently crept up toward 6.75 percent and where activity has been held largely in check ahead of critical producer price and employment data due later this week.</p>
<p>By contrast, analysts said, equity fund managers are awash in cash and busy looking for buys because of inflows from annual retirement account contributions.  </p>
<p>&quot;Money flow continues to be strong,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;Equities seem to be the comfort zone for people who have funds to put to work.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were focusing for now on the earnings implications of a stronger economy and taking comfort in the fact that yields on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury have stabilized around 6.75 percent.</p>
<p>Unless data later in the week spark heightened price or wage concerns, they said, stocks will continue to enjoy the ideal environment of moderate economic growth without inflation.  </p>
<p>The long bond fell 4/32 to yield 6.74 percent in lackluster trade.</p>
<p>The top names in technology continued to pace the rally. International Business Machines Corp added 3-1/2 to 162-5/8, and Cisco Systems Inc rose 7/8 to 66-1/2.</p>
<p>Intel Corp gained 1-3/8 to 139-3/4. Cowen &amp; Co raised its 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates on Intel and reiterated a strong buy rating on the stock.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp rose two points to 59-7/8 after Smith Barney upgraded the shares to buy from outperform.  </p>
<p>New evidence of trouble at Apple Computer Corp sent Apple shares tumbling 3-7/8 to 17-7/8. Several firms dowgraded the stock this morning, following Apple's announcement late Friday that its fiscal first quarter operating loss would far exceed Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p>Toys R Us fell five points to 25-3/4. The company said disappointing sales for the Christmas season would lead to weaker than expected 1996 earnings.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp fell 2-3/8 to 39-1/8 after Salomon Brothers reduced its 1997 and 1998 earnings estimates on the company. Salomon kept its rating on AT&amp;T at hold.</p>
