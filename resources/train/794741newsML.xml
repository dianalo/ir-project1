<headline>HFS, Leon Black's Apollo form $232 million venture.</headline>
<dateline>PARSIPPANY, N.J.</dateline>
<text>
<p>HFS Inc., the acquisition-minded real estate and travel services company, and a group affiliated with investor Leon Black's Apollo Management LP said Tuesday they formed a $232 million venture to buy real estate brokerage firms.</p>
<p>HFS and the Apollo group also said that the new venture, NRT Inc., has agreed to acquire the assets of National Realty Trust, the nation's largest residential real estate brokerage and HFS' largest real estate franchisee with 1996 sales of about $700 million. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>National Realty Trust owns and operates 400 residential realty offices under HFS' Century 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA franchise systems.</p>
<p>&quot;The real estate brokerage industry is extremely fragmented and represents a huge opportunity for consolidation,&quot; HFS Chairman Henry Silverman said in a statement.</p>
<p>The move is the latest expansion bid by HFS, the world's largest franchiser of hotel properties and residential real estate brokerages, which also owns Avis Rent A Car Inc. HFS said Monday that Avis has agreed to buy a major franchisee in California and the Southwest for about $195 million.</p>
<p>In one of the biggest deals announced this year, HFS in May agreed to an $11 billion stock-swap merger with CUC International Inc., the direct marketing powerhouse that reaches into 70 million households.</p>
<p>&quot;Our mission is to sell everything to everyone everywhere,&quot; Silverman said after the CUC deal was announced May 27. The merger is being reviewed by regulators, who requested more information last month.</p>
<p>HFS' hotel franchises include Ramada, Howard Johnson's, Days Inn and Super 8 Motels. The company, based in Parsippany, N.J., has also agreed to franchise Sheraton hotels, now owned by ITT Corp., if Hilton Hotels Corp.'s hostile $8.3 billion bid for ITT is successful.</p>
<p>Under the deal announced Tuesday, HFS will invest $157 million of the $232 million in initial funding slated for NRT. Apollo, an investment firm founded by Black, who is well known on Wall Street, and other institutions will invest $75 million.</p>
<p>When those transactions are completed, NRT together with other assets will have about $575 million in cash and other funds for acquisitions.</p>
<p>NRT also has reached agreements with several other large real estate brokerages for other acquisitions. The deals, whose terms were not disclosed, are subject to reaching definitive agreements and other conditions, the groups said.</p>
<p>They said NRT will use its capital mainly to acquire residential real estate brokerage offices not affiliated with HFS and convert them to HFS franchises.</p>
<p>In addition, they said NRT will use PHH Mortgage Services, a unit of HFS, to be the sole mortgage lender in NRT offices.</p>
<p>NRT expects to complete the purchase of National Realty Trust by the end of August.</p>
<p>HFS stock rose $1 to $63.56 in consolidated early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
