<title>PAKISTAN: Cotton prices seen fluctuating in India, Pakistan.</title>
<headline>Cotton prices seen fluctuating in India, Pakistan.</headline>

<p>Cotton prices are likely to rise in India and dip in Pakistan in the next few days, dealers in the two countries said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In India, prices are expected to rise in anticipation of a government decision to authorise more exports, dealers there said.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect cotton prices on the local market to recover,&quot; said leading Indian cotton trader Manubhai Amersey.</p>
<p>He said state-owned agencies buying cotton from farmers had been demanding more cotton exports to prop up domestic prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the government to allow 250,000/300,000 bales (of 170 kg each) more cotton for export,&quot; Amarsey said. &quot;Officials of state federations are holding talks with the government. A decision may be made next month.&quot;</p>
<p>The government has so far authorised the export of one million bales in the 1996/97 (Oct/Sept) season.</p>
<p>Trade sources expect India's 1996/97 cotton crop to be around 15.5 million bales, marginally below the previous season's 16 million bales.</p>
<p>In the week to Thursday, cotton prices were generally subdued on increased supply, especially in the northern region, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sluggish buying by mills and poor export enquiries pushed cotton prices downward in the midst of improved supplies this week,&quot; Amarsey said.</p>
<p>Traders said daily arrivals in India's Punjab region had risen to around 25,000/30,000 bales in the week just ended week, from 15,000 bales in the previous seven days.</p>
<p>Early this month, new crop arrivals dropped sharply in the northern region because of a severe cold spell, but they picked up after the weather improved, Amarsey said.</p>
<p>In the spot market, Bengal-deshi fell 40/50 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) to 770/825 rupees, while Punjab saw-ginned fell 10/45 rupees to 1,375/1,630.</p>
<p>Gujarat Sankar-4 (long-staple) fell 400/500 rupees to 16,500/17,000 rupees per candy (355.56 kg) for the average variety and to 18,000/18,500 rupees for the superior variety.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, prices are likely to ease as spinners have postponed buying until mid-February owing to general elections on February 3 and holidays for the Moslem festival of Eid al-Fitr on February 9-11, a dealer at Nasim Usman &amp; Co said.</p>
<p>Another factor behind low purchases of cotton was a steep fall in export orders, the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Export orders are likely to rise sharply after the festival,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Textile mills, which had already bought 5.979 million 375-lb bales up to January 15 compared with 5.860 million in the year-ago period, have retired to the sidelines, a broker at the private Karachi Cotton Association (KCA) said.</p>
<p>Some two million unsold bales have piled up at ginneries, which want the government to arrange the purchase of their stocks so that they can pay farmers, the broker said.</p>
<p>Government officials estimate the ex-gin production at nine million bales, enough for the local spinning industry's estimated needs of between 8.5 and 9.0 million bales.</p>
<p>Ginneries had received 7.867 million bales by January 15 compared with 8.287 million in the year-ago period, a Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association executive said.</p>
<p>The main reason for unsold stocks is a credit squeeze from December 1, a bank executive said.</p>
<p>In Pakistan's kerb market, the rate for the NIAB-78 variety ranged between 2,300 and 2,325 rupees per maund (37.32 kg), brokers said.</p>
