<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, citing record traffic at tunnels and bridges, Monday said gross operating revenues hit $2.2 billion in 1996, while its income also gained as expenses were flat.</p>
<p>But little headway was made in tackling the deficit produced by the network of tunnels, bridges, bus terminals and the PATH subway system, which runs between New Jersey and Manhattan. They had a combined deficit of $67 million in 1996, only $1 million less than in 1995, the Authority said.  </p>
<p>The PATH system loses $180 million a year, according to Crain's New York Business, which last week said New York State Gov George Pataki told it he gave its new head, Robert Boyle, six months to a year to say whether it should be restructured or broken up. Dismantling the bi-state agency, a step urged by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, would require New Jersey Gov Christine Whitman's approval, and she has defended it from charges it has favored her state. In prepared remarks, Boyle said: &quot;Looking ahead, we will find new ways to increase efficiency, to enhance service and to improve delivery of projects in our multi-billion dollar capital program.&quot;</p>
<p>No estimate of how much the PATH system might have lost last year was immediately available. The Authority said that gross operating revenues rose $72 million in 1996, while operating expenses were level at $1.5 billion despite severe winter weather. Privatization efforts, such as the sale of the Vista Hotel and the private lease - redevelopment of the World Trade Center's Observation Deck, plus staff cuts helped contain operating expenses. The World Trade Center produced $13.4 million in net income, up from $11.7 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The three airports, Kennedy International, Newark International and LaGuardia, had a combined net income of $189 million, a $17 million increase, as they handled almost 81 million passengers, up 4.3 percent, and air-cargo tonnage continued five-years of increases to about 2.7 million tons. But ports continued to lose ground, running at a net deficit of $46 million, $9 million more than a year-ago.</p>
<p>The Authority invested more than $600 million in capital projects, while reserve balances rose to about $992 million. &quot;Our 30-percent increase in net income, combined with our higher reserve levels, will ensure that we can continue with our ambitious capital program of investment in the region's infrastructure,&quot; said Charles McClafferty, chief financial officer.</p>
