<title>JAPAN: Asian crude gains on futures, physical markets mum.</title>
<headline>Asian crude gains on futures, physical markets mum.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Crude prices firmed marginally in early Asia on Thursday, but largely brushed off a headline-driven futures rally in New York on Wednesday which lifted July WTI values by 27 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>At midday, June cash Brent was notionally assessed at $20.20/20.30, and July Brent at $20.10/20/20. The latter was a touch firmer than London's IPE Wednesday close of $20.12.</p>
<p>Wet markets were slow in waking up from Wednesday's Singapore holiday, with traders reporting no fresh physical deals as of 0300 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're likely to be pretty quiet until next week,&quot; said one trader of Gulf grades.</p>
<p>&quot;You might see some June cargoes traded, and there is some Dubai being talked, but not much more,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Trade in July Middle Eastern grades is likely to begin in earnest by early next week, traders said.</p>
<p>Wednesday's bullishness on NYMEX grew out of reports that Turkish forces has staged another incursion across the border of Iraq, with further support seen from an API stock-driven gasoline gain.  </p>
<p>But the WTI bull run sputtered in out-of hours ACCESS trade, with July retreating to $21.77 from Wednesday's NYMEX settlement of $21.86.</p>
<p>SIMEX Brent was untraded Thursday as of 0250 GMT, with one offer for July registered at $20.20.</p>
