<p>A multi-billion dollar project to build a high-speed rail link between Moscow and St Petersburg is awaiting the green light from Russia's environmental authorities, but has run up against opposition by ecology groups.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no concrete work under way yet as the project has not been approved,&quot; said Andrei Filippov, an official at the foreign relations and ecology department of state-owned RAO Vysokoskorostnye Magistrali (VSM, or High-Speed Railways).</p>
<p>But environmentalists complain that VSM has already started research work and de-mining along a new route. Army units have dug out hundreds of land mines and shells left from the World War Two in an expensive operation.</p>
<p>The $5-5.50 billion project will cut the journey time between Russia's two biggest cities to about two hours from an overnight trip of eight, enabling rail to compete with domestic airlines.</p>
<p>Initially the company considered two plans -- reconstructing the line built in the middle of the last century or building a totally new 654 km (400 mile) track for trains to carry passengers at more than 200 km (125 miles) an hour.</p>
<p>VSM now says the existing line is heavily congested.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the company is pressing ahead with only one option -- a new line which will cross several national parks,&quot; said Greenpeace coordinator Ivan Blokov.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an awful idea. They already have an old line, with pollution all around it, so they should build it there.&quot;</p>
<p>COMPANY HAS ALREADY RAISED MILLIONS FOR PROJECT</p>
<p>VSM has already raised hundreds of millions of dollars in shares, government-guaranteed bonds and loans for the project.</p>
<p>First Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Bolshakov, whose responsibilities include transport, was head of St Petersburg- based VSM before joining the cabinet. Bolshakov said in mid-1994 that the first section of the line could be finished this year, but the project is still on the drawing board.</p>
<p>Gennady Chegasov, head of the state ecology inspection department at the Ecology Ministry said VSM had not presented a concrete project and feasibility study to the ministry for approval and that no work was legally allowed.</p>
<p>&quot;VSM may not start any work before an expert commission has worked out its recommendations on a feasibility study,&quot; Chegasov said, noting that an earlier examination of a preliminary VSM plan had thrown up many irregularities which had to be taken into account in a new project.</p>
<p>The commission, to be appointed by the ministry, will recommend to the government and regional authorities whether the plan should go ahead or not.</p>
<p>The Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily this month quoted professor Alexei Yablokov, head of the Russian Ecology Policy Centre, as saying the Russian government had allocated 9.5 trillion roubles ($1.5 billion) in state guarantees under the project for 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ashamed of the government, for helping such adventurers...participating in this cash-spending orgy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blokov quoted activists in Tver region as saying the local administration was considering a referendum on the rail link. But Tvery deputy governor Mikhail Zorin told Reuters there was no talk of a referendum yet.</p>
<p>&quot;Our legislators will discuss the issue later this month. We want to settle some problems, including ecological ones, with the company, but I would not say that we have any hardline opposition to the project.&quot;</p>
<p>PROTESTS OVER NEW ST PETERSBURG STATION</p>
<p>Ecologists in St Petersburg have protested against the demolition of old buildings to make space for a new railway station.</p>
<p>The government has approved the construction of a railway terminus, with a station, hotel, shopping centre, offices and car park in St Petersburg with a $200 million British loan. The terminus is being built by the British construction company Taylor Woodrow.</p>
<p>But one government official, who asked not to be named, said the conflicting interests of foreign companies competing for the project, as well as ecological issues, was fomenting opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;We have British capital here on the one hand and Franco-German high-speed railway technology on the other. Ecology is just one excuse in their war of interests.&quot;</p>
