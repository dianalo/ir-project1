<p>The British government came under fierce pressure on Thursday to scrap proposed cuts in war pensions totalling 50 million pounds.</p>
<p>The Labour party demanded a statement in the House of Commons on the planned cuts, reported in Thursday's Guardian, while Conservative MP Winston Churchill called for Chief Secretary to the Treasury William Waldegrave to resign.</p>
<p>&quot;I am filled with disbelief that if it were to be true, it is cheap, it is mean, it is nasty and it is utterly unworthy of a government that has done so much for servicemen and servicewomen and especially war widows,&quot; the MP told BBC radio.  </p>
<p>Government officials said the Department of Social Security was simply following the advice of its medical advisors in proposing to reduce the disability pension paid to 10,000 veterans whose hearing was damaged during military service.</p>
<p>The Guardian said this would eventually produce annual savings of 35 million pounds a year out of total cuts of 50 million.</p>
<p>The pensions changes were presented in the small print of last month's budget as a simplification of pensions rules, prompting the Labour party to accuse the government of a cover-up.</p>
