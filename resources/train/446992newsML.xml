<title>VIETNAM: Hanoi court sentences Canadian to death for drugs.</title>

<p>A Canadian national was sentenced to death and her Vietnamese mother was jailed for life by a Hanoi court on Monday for trafficking heroin, court officials and a Canadian diplomat said.</p>
<p>The diplomat said Nguyen Thi Hiep of Montreal and Tran Thi Cam, arrested last April at Hanoi airport as they checked in for a flight to Hong Kong, had 15 days to appeal against the ruling.</p>
<p>He said the court, which was closed to foreign journalists during the three-day trial, also fined the 40-year-old Canadian woman one billion dong ($86,000) and her 70-year-old mother 500 million dong.</p>
<p>He said the two were charged with attempting to take 5.45 kg (12 lb) of heroin out of the country. Vietnamese media said customs officials had discovered the heroin packed in small bags and hidden behind five lacquer paintings in their luggage.</p>
<p>Under Vietnamese law, trafficking in as little as one kg (2.2 lb) of heroin is punishable by death, normally by firing squad.</p>
<p>Hiep, who was reported by local newspapers to have left Vietnam in 1982 and gained Canadian nationality in 1985, is still considered by Hanoi as a Vietnamese citizen.</p>
<p>The diplomat said Canadian officials were allowed to visit her last July but had not seen her since and were now seeking urgent consular access.</p>
<p>There are currently six Canadians, including Hiep, being detained in Vietnam, mostly for offences arising from business disputes.</p>
<p>The trial of the women coincided with a drive by authorities in Ho Chi Minh City to stamp out drug abuse and trafficking. Police swooped on suspected heroin dens in the freewheeling southern city earlier this month, arresting 96 youths.</p>
<p>Drugs experts say Vietnam is both a growing market and a transit route for narcotics from the notorious Golden Triangle opium-poppy growing area where the borders of Laos, Burma and Thailand meet. Heroin is derived from opium.</p>
