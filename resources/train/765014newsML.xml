<p>India's central bank is expected to continue buying dollars for at least two more months in a bid to prevent the rupee's rise on the back of large capital inflows, foreign exchange dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a lot of capital inflows over the next three months,&quot; Arun Dobe, Director (foreign exchange) at Bank of America in Bombay, told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He said dollar demand should pick up by October or November if the Indian Oil Corporation enters the market to buy dollars to fund petroleum imports.</p>
<p>The central Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in contrast to some of its beleaguered counterparts in Southeast Asia, has been buying dollars for the past six months as rising capital flows have led to the supply of dollars far exceeding demand.</p>
<p>Portfolio investments have rushed into Asia's best performing stock market in 1997.</p>
<p>Portfolio investment inflows and foreign direct investment amounted to $5.0 billion in 1996/97 (April-March). Since April, portfolio investment inflows have exceeded $700 million.</p>
<p>Indian firms have been shunning local bank loans to borrow from the offshore market, adding to the dollar oversupply.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporates are bringing dollars and selling (them) to raise rupees here as it is cheaper than locking into a rupee loan,&quot; said a dealer at a European bank.</p>
<p>&quot;They are in effect getting rupees at dollar interest rates,&quot; he said. Most firms raising overseas loans are selling dollars outright, without going for a forward cover, as they are confident the rupee will remain strong, he said.</p>
<p>The rupee has been stable in a broad 35.70 to 35.85 per dollar range for the past year.</p>
<p>India's foreign currency reserves were $25.52 billion rupees on July 17 against $17.70 billion a year ago, according to RBI data.</p>
<p>The rupee's strength has led to importers not hedging their risks and exporters selling their dollar receivables in the forward market for fear of a further rise in the rupee.</p>
<p>India's state-run oil firms -- traditionally the biggest dollar buyers for importing crude and refined products -- and IOC in particular, have been absent from the foreign exchange market this year.</p>
<p>IOC has resorted to large external commercial borrowings since last year, depriving the inter-bank foreign exchange market of its single largest buyer, dealers said.</p>
<p>IOC cannot buy its dollar requirements from the local market as the government owes it over 100 billion rupees in unpaid dues for the sale of subsidised petroleum products.</p>
<p>The government has been talking about raising domestic petroleum product prices to pay the oil companies, but has refrained from taking the politically tough decision.</p>
<p>Dealers said a decision on raising oil prices is unlikely until end-September in view of the turmoil among the 15 parties in the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;If they (oil firms) have rupee resources, they can buy dollars instead of borrowing,&quot; Ravi Pai, chief forex dealer at the private HDFC Bank Ltd in Bombay, said. &quot;This should prove a catalyst for further (dollar) demand.&quot;</p>
