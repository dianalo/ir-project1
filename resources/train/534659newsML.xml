<p>Former Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Bernd Krauss will take over at Real Sociedad of Spain next season on a two-year contract, German sports news agency SID reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Moenchengaldbach sacked Krauss in December last year after a poor first half of the season left them in relegation danger. But the coach was regarded as a success during most of his four years at the club, leading them to the German Cup in 1995.</p>
<p>Krauss will replace Javier Irureta, whose contract with the former Spanish champions will not be renewed.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great chance for a young coach,&quot; the 39-year-old former Austrian international said.</p>
<p>SID said Krauss had signed his contract with Real on Wednesday and watched the team, currently eighth in the Spanish league, in action last weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The team may be mid-table but it has great prospects,&quot; Krauss said. &quot;It's better to go to a club like that than to take over a Bundesliga side fighting against relegation.&quot;</p>
