<p>A flurry of speculator-driven sell orders in pivotals on Wednesday pulled Bombay shares down near the close, cutting off a two-day rally, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People took to squaring off their speculative positions... it was profit-taking at higher levels...&quot; said Basant Agarwal, head of equities at JM Share &amp; Stock Brokers, a local firm.</p>
<p>Dealers said the sell-off was mostly speculative.</p>
<p>A dealer at a domestic brokerage said a lot of operator hammering took place in an attempt to trap bear operators into believing the rally had finally ended.</p>
<p>The Bombay index has rallied nearly five percent in the first two days this week on mounting optimism over market policy initiatives promised by Prime Minster H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda on Monday said the new economic policy measures would be announced before he and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram went to Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 31.</p>
<p>But a government spokesman on Wednesday told Reuters, &quot;The capital market is an important segment. The government effort is to move on a very broad front so the economy picks up in all sectors, not just the capital market.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Unit Trust of India, the country's biggest fund led the wave of profit-taking with other local funds and fence-sitters jumping onto the selling band-wagon.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly...major players turned jittery and that pressed the alarm bells...,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange (NSE) index slumped 13.75 points, or 1.35 percent, to end at a provisional 1,008.05.</p>
<p>Tobacco conglomerate ITC bucked the trend to close 7.45 rupees higher at 404.55 on speculative buying support. At the Bombay bourse, ITC was unchanged at 403.0 rupees, SBI fell 20.70 rupees to 291.75, Reliance 12.70 to 267.75 and TISCO 12.50 to 198.50.</p>
