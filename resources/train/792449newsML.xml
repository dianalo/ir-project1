<title>MALAYSIA: KL SHARES DIP SHARPLY ON FOREIGN SALES.</title>
<headline>KL SHARES DIP SHARPLY ON FOREIGN SALES.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-08-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Share prices were sharply lower mid-morning on Monday as foreigners continued to sell local shares, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>At 0224 GMT, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 2.05 percent at 913.26 points. Five minutes later, the index was down 2.20 percent or 20.47 points at 911.89.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason for anyone to buy local shares. Foreigners are selling as usual and local funds are staying out after Friday's buying,&quot; said a dealer with a local brokerage.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nothing has changed over the weekend except the ringgit has fallen further,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Analysts said a depressing earnings outlook for companies was also responsible for worsening of the sentiment.</p>
<p>They said further weakening of the currency did not revive interest in stocks because not many local companies were expected to benefit from it.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, stocks have cheapened for foreigners who want to buy it. But how many foreigners today want to buy stocks (in this region),&quot; said Phua Lee Kerk, head of research at Jupiter Securities in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>He said earnings outlook across many sectors, particularly highly import-dependant automobile business, was looking much weaker than before.</p>
<p>Debutante General Soil Engineering opened at 7.90 ringgit against an offer price of 2.70, but dipped 7.20 ringgit around 0250 GMT.</p>
