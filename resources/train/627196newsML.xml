<p>Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said on Friday he wanted early elections if main opposition parties pushed through parliament local government spending plans that would boost overall public expenditure and lead to tax rises.</p>
<p>Guterres's remarks to reporters at a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Sintra followed a threat by Planning Minister Joao Cravinho on Wednesday to call early polls over the opposition plans which he said would break the budget and block the country's entry to the European single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;If the opposition take their proposals to a conclusion that we feel is unacceptable for the country, because they would mean raising taxes sharply or foregoing entry to the single currency, the government would have to say clearly that the people should decide,&quot; Guterres said.</p>
<p>Guterres' Socialist government was elected in October 1995 after pledging to lead Portugal into the single currency from the start in 1999 and promising not to raise taxes, but its victory fell four seats short of an absolute majority.</p>
<p>Any decision to call early elections would be taken by President Jorge Sampaio.</p>
<p>Jorge Coelho, assistant minister to the Prime Minister, told TSF radio earlier on Friday that the government would refuse to prepare the 1998 budget if the opposition parties did not withdraw their plans.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot prepare a budget that causes an increase in taxes in Portugal,&quot; Coelho said.</p>
<p>The Diario de Noticias newspaper quoted Coelho as saying: &quot;The government will not prepare the 1998 budget if the (opposition) Social Democratic Party does not withdraw in the parliamentary commission its local financing bill.&quot;</p>
<p>The government must present its 1998 budget proposals to parliament by October 15 this year.</p>
<p>The government says that the various proposals presented in parliament by the main opposition centre-right Social Democrats and two smaller parties would mean either a sharp increase in overall taxes or a widening in the budget deficit.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, parliament approved the general text of the opposition proposals, the first step towards their eventual adoption by the legislature.</p>
<p>They now pass to a special committee on local government for detailed discussion and a final vote by the chamber.</p>
<p>The opposition parties deny their plans would hurt the budget and accuse the government of political scare tactics.</p>
<p>But Coelho told TSF radio that the opposition's local financing proposals would raise public spending by 150 billion escudos ($870 million) and trigger a hike in income tax. He repeated that the government was determined not to raise taxation.</p>
<p>Asked if the government would call early elections if the opposition pushed through its proposals, Coelho said it did not want to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) it is illegitimate that a government should govern in violation of its own programme,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Reducing the budget deficit is a key condition for meeting the criteria for entry to European Economic and Monetary Union. $1=172.238 escudos</p>
