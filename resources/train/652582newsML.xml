<p>Dissident Congolese militia leader Denis Sassou Nguesso called on his supporters on Wednesday to observe a ceasefire after seven days of fighting with the army of President Pascal Lissouba.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso, speaking on his militia's own radio station, Radio Congo Freedom, asked &quot;that the arms be silenced&quot;. He was responding to an earlier announcement by Lissouba of a unilateral ceasefire.</p>
<p>&quot;I ask that the arms be silent and hope that other parties, at least this time, respect their commitments, and that the parties in conflict will keep their positions on the ground,&quot; the former Marxist president said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Lissouba had said on state radio: &quot;I order an immediate ceasefire to give a chance for mediation. Peace must remain our first objective.&quot;</p>
<p>The president's announcement followed a meeting he held on Tuesday with Brazzaville Mayor Bernard Kolelas who is chairing a mediation committee of the two sides. A spokesman for Kolelas said that he had spoken by telephone on Wednesday with Sassou Nguesso.</p>
<p>In his broadcast, the rebel leader said the reason he had declared the ceasefire was because he cared about &quot;the need to organise transparent presidential elections in July, the free circulation of candidates and voters across the whole country.&quot;</p>
<p>It was too early to say whether the ceasefire would take hold.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent said that, early in the evening, heavy fire could be heard from the French base at the city's airport including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and tracer fire. Late in the evening, though, the shooting had died down.</p>
