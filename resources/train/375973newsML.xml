<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch shares close higher, index up on Royal Dutch.</title>
<headline>Dutch shares close higher, index up on Royal Dutch.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares ended at a fresh record close on Thursday, the fifth AEX record in a row.</p>
<p>The AEX blue chip index ended 6.92 points higher at 712.50 points. The AMX &quot;midcap&quot; index closed 14 points up at 1099.88.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade was dominated by professional traders, but also pointed to growing retail interest.</p>
<p>Trade focused on Royal Dutch and Philips which both released their annual results in the morning.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch, which announced a four-for-one share split, also dominated options trade. The shares added 11.70 guilders to close at 347.50.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures were just fabulous, the split is great. Nobody expected things to be this good,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Philips, which reported a Q4 loss, dipped in the morning but soon recovered to end at 81.00 guilders, up 2.90 from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Dealers pointed out the large size of many deals, suggesting the major buyers of the stock were likely foreign parties.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, no Dutch investor would buy the stock at these levels. Anybody following the company knows it's bad stuff,&quot; one dealer said, adding his analyst agreed.</p>
<p>Another said buyers returned after the analyst meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard some very positive echoes of the meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One trader attributed the rise to the Boonstra effect.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a very good speaker, convincing people his reorganisations are going to work out fine,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Good sentiment towards the semiconductor sector led computer software Baan 5.20 guilders higher to 93.70, while ASM International added 1.50 guilders to 31.50 guilders.</p>
<p>However, one dealer played down the rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Those semis are hocus pocus to me. Put it all in a pot and start mixing. Tomorrow the shares might just as well lose double the amount they gained today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Polygram, which released figures on Wednesday, ended down 2.40 guilders at 86.10 on disappointment that Philips has no plans to shed its 75 percent stake in the company.</p>
<p>Shares of food group Nutricia ended 3.40 guilders higher at 277.40. Dealers attributed the rise to the end of the salmonella scare concerning the company's baby food.</p>
