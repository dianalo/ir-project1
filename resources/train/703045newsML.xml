<title>USA: US Spot Prods-Gulf gasoline diffs strengthen again.</title>
<headline>US Spot Prods-Gulf gasoline diffs strengthen again.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Strength in the U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline differentials continued Wednesday as buyers there scrambled to secure prompt conventional barrels.</p>
<p>Midcontinent gasoline differentails weakened modestly despite an outage at Ashland's St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery. The company shut a crude unit there Tuesday, but said it would try to bring it up today.</p>
<p>On the NYMEX, August gasoline was down 0.03 cent and August heating oil was down 0.19 cent.</p>
<p>U.S. GULF COAST</p>
<p>Regular unleaded gasoline was again the top story in Houston amid continued buying by refiners, and to a greater extent than in some time, traders as well.</p>
<p>The bullish passing of a prompt scheduling deadline for shipment on the Houston-to-New York Colonial Pipeline Tuesday for the &quot;M1&quot; southern grade regular conventional gasoline did little to slow the buying interest.</p>
<p>Some players, dismissing the possibility that the refiner buying was linked to logistical preparations for the three-day U.S. Independence Day holiday during which millions of motorists are likely to take to the road, said instead that the market is well balanced and good demand is for the moment tipping the scales in a bullish direction.</p>
<p>The now prompt front 20th M1 cycle was offered Wednesday morning at 1.00 cent under August futures after deals were heard done in the early going at 1.50, 1.40 and 1.30 cents under the August print. Bids were at 1.30 cents under.</p>
<p>Traders also noted that the last of the M1 that officially scheduled out of Colonial's Pasadena, Texas terminus on Tuesday at levels as strong as 1.00 cent under August NYMEX was being talked on Wednesday at even higher levles of 0.50 cent under, with some players guessing deals could be closed by the end of the day at the price of August futures.</p>
<p>&quot;I moved 225,000 barrels myself (on Tuesday), and I'm nothing,&quot; said one trader, stressing that large volumes of M1 changed hands and more were likely to on Wednesday, perhaps because players were eager to finish all their work before the &quot;Fourth of July&quot; holiday begins for them when the NYMEX shuts for the long weekend from early Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>But if M1 was all the rage Wednesday at the Gulf Coast, the distillates were an ugly causing, enjoying none of the intense focus on the gasoline.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very lethargic as far as distillates go. Everybody just wants to do some gasoline deals,&quot; said another trader in Houston.</p>
<p>Still, some deals were getting done, including slightly deferred front 20th cycle 74-grade low sulphur diesel at a 1.70 cents discount to August NYMEX heating oil and prompt 86-grade heating oil at 2.35 cents under.</p>
<p>Also, prompt cycle jet fuel was rumored to have been done at 0.15 cent over in the case of airline-quality 54-grade material and at 0.40 cent over for low sulphur 55-grade, traders said.</p>
<p>MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>Differentials on Chicago conventional unleaded gasoline eased a half cent, to offers of a half cent over August futures, players said. Any-month barrels eased almost one cent to 0.50 cent under the screen.</p>
<p>The slippage came on the heels of new API data released late Tuesday showing a 1.3 million barrel gasoline build in the Midwest for the week ending June 27, by far the largest build of any region in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting a little sloppy, especially further out&quot; in late July, one Chicago trader said.</p>
<p>Spot Chicago low sulfur diesel was little changed at 0.85 cents below the screen, said players, citing a dearth of activity.</p>
<p>In the Group Three market, however, differentials held steady with few trades spotted by late morning. Prompt low sulfur diesel remained on offer for 1.25 cents over August futures, while conventional unleaded gasoline was talked at 2.25 cents over.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just pre-holiday dullness. I havent heard a single deal. And there are no phone calls coming in,&quot; one Group broker said.</p>
<p>NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Differentials showed little movement in early action, though players said activity appeared to be fairly brisk.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of people are going to be gone tomorrow,&quot; one trader said, which prompted many players to try to finish their business early.</p>
<p>Prompt regular conventional M1 gasoline was talked between 3.00 and 3.25 cents under the August NYMEX, steady with late Wednesday levels.</p>
<p>Prompt reformulated A1 gasoline was put between 0.10 and 0.20 cents under the August futures, while premium grade D2 reformulated was seen between 6.50 and 6.75 cents over the futures.</p>
<p>Prompt low sulphur diesel was offered at about 0.40 cent over the August NYMEX heating oil, slightly weaker than Tuesday levels, according to traders.</p>
