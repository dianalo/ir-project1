<headline>Rebels said to be close to Zaire's second city.</headline>
<dateline>LUBUMBASHI, Zaire 1997-04-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Fear gripped Zaire's second city Lubumbashi on Monday amid reports that rebels had taken the town of Kipushi, 30 km (18 miles) southwest on the Zambian border.</p>
<p>Shops remained shut and students hurried home from the city centre as the reports spread. There were no taxis and very few other vehicles in the town, where daily life ground to a halt.</p>
<p>The fall of Kipushi could not be directly confirmed, but business people in Lubumbashi said the news had come directly from Kipushi residents contacted by telephone before lines became jammed.</p>
<p>If the rebels have taken Kipushi it would bring them within a couple hours of Lubumbashi, which means they will have almost encircled the city. Rebels are also within 220 km (130 miles) of Lubumbashi in the northwest and the northeast.</p>
