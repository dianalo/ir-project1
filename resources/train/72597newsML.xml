<headline>Mexico gunman escapes police siege, frees reporter.</headline>
<dateline>GUADALAJARA, Mexico 1996-09-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>A dramatic hostage standoff watched live on television in Mexico's second city ended with the flight of the kidnapper and the safe release of a TV journalist caught in the standoff, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The stand-off -- watched for hours on local TV by a population increasingly nervous about violent crime -- began on Monday afternoon when two men broke into a house in the Guadalajara suburb of Zapopan and were met by police as they made their escape.</p>
<p>A police sergeant was wounded and one of the robbers killed in a shoot-out before the remaining robber fled.</p>
<p>&quot;He then took a vehicle from a lady who was doing her shopping ... and drove to a house, where he was found&quot; several hours later, said Javier Pena Osorio, director of municipal police in Zapopan.</p>
<p>The gunman, who told police he was called Francisco Lopez, threatened to harm an elderly lady and two children at the house unless a journalist was brought to him, officials said. The residents of the house later turned out to be relatives of the gunman.</p>
<p>Carlos Cabello Wallace, a television journalist from private network Televisa, was called to the house and later drove the gunman and his relatives away from the house around midnight (0500 GMT) in a Televisa van.</p>
<p>Cabello was not heard of again until Televisa reported on Tuesday morning that he was resting at home after his release in the Guadalajara suburb of Tlaquepaque. The whereabouts of the gunman and his relatives were unknown, police and Televisa officials said.</p>
