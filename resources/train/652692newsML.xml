<p>An administrative court in the port of Gdansk ruled on Wednesday that former Polish president Lech Walesa would not have to pay any taxes on $1 million he received in 1989 for film rights.</p>
<p>Judge Boguslaw Szumacher said the Gdansk unit of the Supreme Administrative Court rejected a motion by the local tax office saying Walesa owed back taxes for money he received from Warner Brothers for the right to make a film about his life.</p>
<p>The court ruled that even if Walesa had been obliged to pay the taxes he should have done so by the end of 1994 and the obligation had now expired.</p>
<p>The issue of Walesa's taxes emerged during the 1995 presidential election in which he was narrowly defeated by his ex-communist challenger Aleksander Kwasniewski.</p>
<p>Walesa's aides said then that the fee was not liable to Polish tax and taxes had been paid in the United States.</p>
<p>Walesa told Reuters he felt only partially vindicated by the court's ruling. &quot;I have won but who will give me back my reputation,&quot; he said.</p>
