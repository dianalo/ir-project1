<p>A provincial governor appointed a military officer as town mayor in northwest Colombia after the civilian one was kidnapped by leftist rebels, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Alvaro Uribe, governor of Antioquia, named Maj. Luis Fernando Rojas as mayor of Vegachi after suspected National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas seized the elected mayor Ivan Vasquez over the weekend.</p>
<p>Under emergency powers passed by the central government last year, governors are allowed to appoint serving military personnel as mayors in a bid to reduce guerrilla activity.</p>
<p>This was the third time Uribe has appointed a military mayor in Antioquia.</p>
<p>At least 20 mayors have been killed in political violence since January last year. Vasquez was the second mayor to be kidnapped in Antioquia this month. The other was freed on Sunday.</p>
