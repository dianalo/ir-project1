<p>Nomura Securities Co Ltd Chairman and President Masashi Suzuki said on Tuesday that a planned drastic reshuffle in the firm's top management, including his own resignation as president, aims to regain public trust in the Japanese brokerage.</p>
<p>Suzuki spoke at a news conference after the company's earlier announcement that he would step down as president on May 1.  </p>
<p>Junichi Ujiie, currently a Nomura managing director and scheduled to replace Suzuki as president on May 1, told the same news conference his aim as president will be to establish a transparent management system based on clear rules.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to establish a management system which is transparent and facilitates open discussion,&quot; Ujiie said.</p>
<p>He added there was an atmosphere inside the company that discouraged free discussion among executives.</p>
<p>Nomura earlier on Tuesday announced that Suzuki would resign as president and 15 other board members would also step down.  </p>
<p>The 15 executives include five executive vice presidents and four senior managing directors.</p>
<p>Ujiie said: &quot;I must make the utmost effort to restore trust (in Nomura) as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Suzuki said that while he had expected to transfer the company's management to the next generation after regaining public trust, Nomura's current situation was very serious and he was forced to implement sweeping changes quickly.</p>
<p>He said that Nomura is facing difficult problems, including continued investigation by regulators and expected administrative punishment by the Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>He also said Nomura's clients had increasingly been suspending business with the brokerage since the beginning of April and Nomura's employees were receiving complaints from customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Nomura is experiencing the worst crisis since it was founded,&quot; he said.</p>
