<headline>Mauritius sugar shares up but market index eases.</headline>
<dateline>PORT LOUIS 1996-10-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Several stocks in the sugar sector gained ground on Wednesday in anticipation of record export proceeds in 1996 but the Stock Exchange of Mauritius market index eased 0.34 points to 317.44 in quiet trading.</p>
<p>Bourse officials said volume traded totalled 5.93 million rupees on 405,364 shares from 2.51 million rupees on 79,061 shares on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;With record sugar export receipts of 8.1 billion rupees expected by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate for the year 1996/97, sentiment on shares in the sugar sector is good,&quot; a bourse official told Reuters. &quot;However, the traditional market illiquidity also means a small volume can easily drive up the sugar stock prices.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mauritius Sugar Syndicate said last month export receipts reached a record level in 1995/96 with 6.9 billion rupees on a weather-hit production of 540,000 tonnes. The official forecast for this year is 610,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;A better production for this year together with the present depreciation of the rupee against the pound are good signs for the sugar industry,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>The majority of Mauritian sugar exports are priced in the European currency Ecu and proceeds paid in pounds.</p>
<p>Sugar stocks gaining were Harel Freres, up 60 cents to 40.50 rupees on 25 shares, Mon Desert Alma (ordinary) which jumped 1.50 rupees to 90 on 10 shares, Mon Desert Alma (preference) which surged 2.0 rupees to 77 but with no volume traded.</p>
<p>Mon Tresor Mon Desert was unchanged at 35 rupees on 8,480 shares and Savannah (ordinary) was stable at 125 rupees on 311 shares.</p>
<p>Trading in the rest of the market was quiet and in view of the relatively high transaction volumes, foreign investors were again seen trading shares of Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB), State Bank of Mauritius, Mauritius Development Investment Trust (MDIT) and conglomerate Rogers.</p>
<p>MCB was unchanged at 71.50 rupees on 5,400 shares. State Bank remained at 8.50 rupees on 124,388 shares. MDIT shed 20 cents to 7.10 rupees on 158,248 shares while Rogers ended flat at 89 rupees on 11,200 shares.</p>
<p>Mauritius Oil Refineries climbed 40 cents to 9.20 rupees on 27,118 shares on a reported 57 percent rise in pre-tax profit for the year ending 30 June, 1996.</p>
<p>Fincorp Investment was stable at 71 rupees on 7,000 shares. Happy World Foods was up 10 cents to 14.10 rupees on 2,250 shares and conglomerate Ireland Blyth gained 10 cents to 12.40 rupees on 7,170 shares.</p>
<p>Hotel concern Sun Resorts was unchanged at 35.70 rupees on 7,852 shares and national carrier Air Mauritius remained at 50 rupees on 5,012 shares.</p>
<p>Caudan Debentures was stable at 1,085 rupees on 205 units.</p>
