<p>Wall Street's takeover experts predict British Telecommunications PLC will pare back the price it will pay for MCI Communications Corp following the U.S. long distance company's announcement profits will be hurt by the cost of entering local telephone markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Number one, the deal gets done,&quot; said an arb, who declined to be identified. &quot;All the strategic rationale is still there, but it clearly warrants a price cut. The questions are: how big are the problems, what percentage are CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) issues, and is it a one-time shot or ongoing?&quot;  </p>
<p>The deal, worth in excess of $20 billion, was first announced in November. After the MCI news, BT said it could not rule out a possible renegotiation of the deal.</p>
<p>The companies did not return telephone calls seeking comment on possible changes to the agreement.</p>
<p>The transaction, the largest transatlantic deal ever, would make the resulting company -- to be named Concert Plc -- a global telecommunications powerhouse.</p>
<p>When the deal was announced, BT and MCI said Concert would have annual revenues of more than $42 billion and 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is definitely a material adverse change, and they (BT) clearly have the leverage to, at the very least, cut the price. So I think the deal gets cut, though it can be killed but I don't think that is likely,&quot; added a second arb, who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>After Thursday's U.S. market close, MCI said second-half 1997 and full-year 1998 earnings are expected to drop below Wall Street expections.  </p>
<p>MCI cited higher-than-expected losses related to delays by U.S. regional Bell companies, the companies that dominate the local markets, and heavy investments it is making to extend its reach into this business.</p>
<p>The First Call consensus view for 1997 was $1.66 and $1.89 for 1998. MCI expects to meet analysts' second-quarter estimates of $0.40 per share.</p>
<p>In Friday morning trade, MCI shares were off 6-1/8, or 14.45 percent, at 36-1/4 in heavy Nasdaq trade, up from a session-low 35-3/8, while BT's NYSE-listed American Depositary Receipts fell 6-1/16, or 7.43 percent, to 75-1/2.  </p>
<p>The terms of the deal call for each MCI share to be exchanged for 0.54 BT ADRs, and a cash payment of US$6.</p>
<p>Each BT ADR represents 10 ordinary BT shares.</p>
<p>After the closing of the transaction, MCI shareholders would own 34 percent of the fully-diluted share capital of the new company, they said when the merger was announced.</p>
