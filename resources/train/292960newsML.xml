<p>A revitalised world number one Pete Sampras on Wednesday promised a stronger challenge to regain the Australian Open title after his shock early exit last year.</p>
<p>Sampras handed his rivals a warning in his first competitive match of the season with a 6-4 7-5 win against Germany's Michael Stich at the Colonial Classic in Melbourne, a warm-up exhibition event for the Open which starts on Monday.</p>
<p>But it was his state of health as much as his current form that gave the 25-year-old American reason for optimism.</p>
<p>Sampras, who lost to unseeded Australian Mark Philippoussis in a stunning third round upset in Melbourne in 1996, said he felt fresher mentally this year.</p>
<p>His preparation contrasts sharply to last year when Sampras said he went into the Open suffering the lingering effects of influenza.</p>
<p>&quot;Philippoussis out-played me, but I didn't feel quite as fresh as I do this year. Last year I wasn't quite there,&quot; said the U.S. Open champion, who won his only Australian Open title three years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I was very tired and I came down here sick. But this year I've had a good break, I've got here ready and eager to go.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, defending Australian Open champion Boris Becker said he was still affected by a wrist injury that disrupted his season last year, including one enforced 10-week break.</p>
<p>&quot;The wrist is not 100 percent but I have had worse so I can't complain,&quot; said Becker, the world number six, after beating Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev 7-6 (7-3) 6-1.</p>
<p>&quot;Even a healthy body feels the effects of playing on new surfaces with new balls, and a beaten up one like mine is going to feel it even a bit more,&quot; said the 29-year-old German.</p>
<p>Compatriot Stich is also worried by a slight injury scare ahead of the Open after straining a left thigh muscle during the match against Sampras on the opening day of the Classic at Kooyong.</p>
<p>&quot;The leg was not perfect and it hurt a bit on court,&quot; said Stich, the world number 19. &quot;I felt it especially when I was trying to push off on the leg during my service. I don't think it is serious but we will find out next week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>American Michael Chang, the defending champion at Kooyong and world number two, beat Sweden's Thomas Enqvist 7-5 6-4.</p>
<p>&quot;Regardless of the situation -- whether is a grand slam, a regular tournament or an exibition like this -- I always try to win to get an edge on the other guy,&quot; Chang said.</p>
<p>In the final match of the day, French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia beat American Jim Courier 7-6 (10-8) 6-4.</p>
