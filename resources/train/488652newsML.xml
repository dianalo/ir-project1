<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The dollar was bolstered versus the yen by a series of comments by visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, briefly rising as much as more than one yen from earlier in late Tokyo on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rubin expressed concerns about a rise in Japan's current account surplus, but brushed aside suggestions that a stronger yen is the best way to avoid a further rise in the surplus.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is critical that Japan's current account surplus not rise again to a level that is detrimental to global growth, that causes trade friction with Japan's trading partners and that could fuel protectionist sentiments,&quot; he said after a meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
<p>Rubin also said: &quot;We don't believe in anybody using their currency for trade policies -- us or anybody else.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders in Tokyo who had expected harsh remarks by Rubin against Japan were caught off guard and rushed to buy back dollars, since the overall tone of his comments was relatively soft, dealers said.  </p>
<p>In the afternoon, remarks by Rubin that a further rise in Japan's current account surplus would re-ignite trade friction temporarily dented the dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>But he also supported a strong dollar policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy is that a strong dollar lowers inflation in the U.S...and we have had a strong dollar for some time now,&quot; he told a news conference during a one-day visit to Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. can't change its dollar policy easily due to various reasons, including a chance that such a change would cause damage to the already nervous U.S. financial markets,&quot; said Wataru Ito, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.  </p>
<p>Sanwa Bank's Ito said dollar/yen price movements were also exaggerated by stop-loss dollar buying at around 123.30-50 yen, which lifted the dollar as high as 123.68 yen.</p>
<p>He said there was uncertainty over whether the dollar would continue to rise before and after the release of U.S. March unemployment data due out at 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a risk of inducing dollar long positions if the outcome of strong U.S. job data leads to another U.S. credit tightening in May and that hits the U.S. stock market,&quot; he added. But some dealers disagreed. Expectations of a widening U.S.-Japan interest rate gap could support the dollar.  </p>
<p>&quot;The dollar hasn't been sold against the yen very much despite Wall Street's fall over the past several days,&quot; said a senior trader at a French bank in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the falling Japanese market rates and stocks, strong U.S. data could become a dollar-boosting factor,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The key 182th 10-year government bond fell to record low of 2.130 percent on Friday, while the 225-share Nikkei average lost 268.72 points, or 1.48 percent, to 17,860.59.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters, on average, expect to see 196,000 jobs created and average hourly earnings rising by 0.4 percent.  </p>
<p>They also see the unemployment rate dropping to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We're waiting for non-farm payrolls and the market's pretty nervous,&quot; said a European bank dealer in Singapore, adding that the market would probably react adversely to a payroll figure above 280,000.</p>
