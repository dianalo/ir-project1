<title>SLOVAKIA: Slovak parliament withdraws anti-subversion law.</title>

<p>Slovakia's ruling coalition has withdrawn plans to push through parliament a controversial law which was heavily criticised for borrowing on communist-era anti-subversion legislation.</p>
<p>Peter Brnak, Constitutional Committtee chairman and Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) member, told parliament late on Thursday the move was &quot;a result of the will of the coalition to draft better-quality legislation.&quot;</p>
<p>Jan Cuper, a leading HZDS deputy, told Reuters: &quot;A new version of the law will probably be placed on the agenda of the December session of parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>The law was originally drafted by the ultra-right Slovak National Party (SNS) -- a junior coalition partner -- as the price for supporting a treaty with neighbouring Hungary.</p>
<p>The controversial penal code with &quot;protection of the republic&quot; legislation, was originally approved in March but later returned by President Michal Kovac for revision.</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union have criticised the law, an ammendment to the penal code, and other legislation drafted by the government of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar.</p>
<p>Both have expressed concerns that Slovakia is dragging its feet on a commitment to democracy.</p>
<p>Under the law, people could be punished for acts such as organising anti-government demonstrations or publishing &quot;false information&quot; abroad. Some of its wording is almost identical to anti-subversion laws scrapped after the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>The opposition proposed that the law be wiped off the agenda of the current parliament which comes up for re-election in the autumn of 1998, but the proposal was rejected by the three- party coalition which holds a majority in the legislative body.</p>
