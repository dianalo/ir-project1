<p>Sweden has the capacity to cut annual working time by a total of 100 hours by 2002, Prime Minister Goran Persson said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We, the party's executive committee, estimate that the increase in production gives us room to lower the year's working hours by 100 hours over the coming five years,&quot; Persson told a news conference at the ruling Social Democrats' party meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It means cutting the working week by a couple of hours.&quot;</p>
<p>The party's executive committee has, at this week's two-day meeting, shifted its focus after three years of concentrating on savings and tackling state finances.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no further savings that we need to make. We are in a period with scope for growth in the economy that will be distributed as fairly as possible,&quot; Persson said.</p>
<p>The most pressing issue was lowering work hours which would help the country's unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not rule out a change in the law,&quot; Persson said.</p>
<p>The executive committee will address the question of taxation at the party's annual congress in September.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not really ready in the tax area. The national defence levy will be dissolved at the end of December 1998 but we are looking at some kind of proposal where the strongest group in society can contribute more than 50 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He thinks that the party will reach an agreement on tax by the time of the Social Democrats' annual congress in September.</p>
<p>Persson said he could not promise to cut taxes but there would not be any increase in tax pressure.</p>
