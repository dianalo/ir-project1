<p>The Italian government on Monday called a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament to sweep aside opposition amendments to a batch of measures included in its 1997 budget.</p>
<p>The package, designed to raise around 4.3 trillion lire ($2.59 billion) this year, was introduced by a cabinet decree at the end of December and now needs parliamentary approval to become full legislation.</p>
<p>But the measures have been weighed down by hundreds of amendments and Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco asked parliament to hold a do-or-die confidence vote to ram the decree into law.</p>
<p>Parliamentary party leaders were due to decide later on Monday when the vote would be held and state television said it would probably take place on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition relies on the hardleft Communist Refoundation for its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (lower house).</p>
<p>Refoundation has previously given broad backing to the year-end package of measures, which formed the final part of the government's massive 1997 budget, designed to cut 62.5 trillion lire off the state deficit.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians from Communist Refoundation abstained in a brief vote held to accept Visco's request.</p>
<p>&quot;We abstained because we were neither convinced by the need for this nor against it,&quot; Refoundation's parliamentary party leader, Oliviero Diliberto, said.</p>
<p>Prodi called numerous confidence motions in both the upper and lower houses of parliament last year to brush past opposition filibustering on a wide range of legislation, winning all the votes with ease.</p>
<p>The end-of-year package expected to raise some two trillion lire in 1997 by forcing companies to speed up payments of certain excise duties -- mainly on mineral oils, alcoholic beverages, methane gas and electricity.</p>
<p>It also included measures against tax evasion and included incentives to scrap cars more than 10 years old in an effort to boost the flagging auto sector.</p>
<p>Prodi and Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi are now working on a fresh budget package to be unveiled shortly in a bid to mop up an overshoot in 1996 accounts. The government is expected to introduce deficit-cutting measures worth around 15 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Refoundation has already warned that it will not support any fresh tax increases or new reductions state spending.</p>
