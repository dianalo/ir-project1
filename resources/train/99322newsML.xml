<p>London cocoa futures marched higher on late short-covering on Monday after early selling disappeared but no news was cited behind the move.</p>
<p>The benchmark March contract rallied through nearby resistance at 1,000 stg in the last hour of trading to end just off session peak at 1,003 stg a tonne, up 12 stg on the day. It saw a high of 1,004 stg and a low of 985 stg. Some traders were surprised by the move which followed morning losses but said that the French franc's recovery could have been a helping factor. The franc's weakness had prompted African producers to sell last week.</p>
<p>The market is awaiting news from Ivory Coast where exporters are due to meet government officials this week to push for increases in the bareme payment structure for the 1996/97 cocoa season. Exporters want a rise of up to 25 percent.</p>
<p>Eyes are also on the German grind figure, due out on Wednesday or Thursday, which traders say could show a steady increase with a shift of processing capacity partly to the Netherlands now apparently over.</p>
<p>But brokers GNI said earlier the German data could dampen the market's enthusiasm slightly after surprisingly strong UK and Dutch figures last week.</p>
<p>Monday's trading was mostly outright and turnover totalled 3,609 lots.</p>
<p>The March contract technically needs to clear 1,025 stg to secure a healthy uptrend, but a better confirmation will be around 1,045-1,050 stg, analysts said.</p>
