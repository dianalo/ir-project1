<p>Sri Lankan stocks ended barely changed on Tuesday when institutions focused their attention to the sale of a controlling stake in a plantation firm being privatised, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Colombo Stock Exchange all share index closed 0.14 points higher at 556.44. NDB, a development finance institution rose one rupee to 191 and Tea Services three rupees to 63.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was very thin because we were unable to source shares in bulk,&quot; said Ralph Wijesinghe of Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Turnover was 6.22 million rupees with 183,750 shares changing hands.  </p>
<p>With the index strongly supported at around the 550 level, brokers said virtually no one wanted to liquidate holdings.</p>
<p>Investors were keenly watching biddings on Hapugastenne Plantations, for which the government was selling a 51 percent stake on the bourse as part of its privatisation campaign.</p>
<p>The parcel was bought by a local constortium for 23.75 rupees a share, brokers said. This raised 242.25 million rupees.</p>
<p>The government said it would also sell a 51 percent stake in Balangod Plantations, another estate firm. Bids close on September 12. -- Prithi Kodagoda 941-434319</p>
