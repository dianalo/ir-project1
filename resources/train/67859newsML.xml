<title>NETHERLANDS: Akzo happy with early antidepressant sales.</title>

<p>Organon, the pharmaceuticals arm of Dutch group Akzo Nobel, said on Friday it was pleased with early sales of its novel antidepressant Remeron.</p>
<p>Rolled out on the Dutch market two years ago, Remeron won U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) approval earlier this year and came on to the market there in late July. It was launched -- as Remergil -- in Germany in April 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very happy with early sales,&quot; Ron Huisman from Organon's marketing division told Reuters at a press briefing on the eve of a European College of Neuropsychopharmacology congress in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Remeron (mirtazapine) is a novel dual-action compound which acts on both the brain's noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems where an imbalance is believed to be the root cause of depression. Organon claims its new drug has fewer side-effects than other antidepressants.</p>
<p>Huisman said that monthly sales of the drug in Germany were around one million marks ($660,000) while, after a slow start, Dutch sales were running at around 400,000 to 500,000 guilders a month.</p>
<p>He said Remergil had taken a two percent market share in Germany after just two months and sales were on target, but it was too early to analyse U.S. sales.</p>
<p>Huisman said Organon aimed to get Remeron in among the top three antidepressants worldwide, but gave no timeframe for this.</p>
<p>Sales of Eli Lilly's Prozac, the best-selling treatment for depression -- which conservatively affects some 340 million people worldwide -- were over $2 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Depression -- mood and anxiety disorder -- is estimated to cost the U.S. alone over $53 billion a year, mainly through absenteeism among workers and reduced productivity.</p>
