<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine stocks extend losses at close.</title>
<headline>Argentine stocks extend losses at close.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-06-26</dateline>

<p>Argentine stocks stretched losses Thursday at the close in an erratic trading pattern which traders blamed on Wall Street.</p>
<p>But they expected prices to stay firm Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The bolsa has latched onto the volatile streak in New York,&quot; said Gabriel Ruiz at brokers Tavelli. &quot;Players are not shedding positions, but those who had the cash to keep buying have moved to the sidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index fell 1.0 percent to 811.83. It had closed 0.6 percent lower Wednesday after slipping off a five-year high of 830.  </p>
<p>Traders said next week's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve was sending some jitters through the markets.</p>
<p>&quot;There's program selling in New York and profit-taking, which is logical after the Dow's recent upward march. There's also talk the Fed will hike rates next week, although nobody really believes that,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>The broad market shed 0.6 percent, with losers pounding winners 43 to 16 and 22 issues closing flat.</p>
<p>Floor volume shrank to 27.9 million pesos from 40.8 million Wednesday, while over-the-counter turnover dwindled to 69.3 million pesos from 101.9 million Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Main-tier losses were led by holding company Comercial del Plata, construction stock Juan Minetti and carmaker Ciadea, which fell 3.9 percent, 3.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The top blue-chip performer was carmaker Sevel, which rebounded 3.1 percent after diving 7.0 percent Wednesday on talk of a new share issue.</p>
<p>Other MerVal gainers were power utility Central Costanera and gas distributor Transportadora de Gas del Sur, which rose 1.2 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively.</p>
