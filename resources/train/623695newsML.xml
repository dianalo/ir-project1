<p>Several NATO states expressed support on Thursday for inviting as many as five new members into the alliance when it opens its doors to former communist foes next month, alliance diplomats said.</p>
<p>They said nine foreign ministers spoke in favour of asking five applicant countries to join while two spoke in favour of restricting the number to three. Five others among NATO's 16 current members said they still had an open mind.</p>
<p>No countries were mentioned by name, but former Warsaw Pact members Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic lead the field of 11 contenders with Slovenia and Romania making strong late challenges.</p>
<p>Alliance diplomatic sources said the United States, by far NATO's most important member, and Iceland were clearly in favour of only taking in three new countries in the first wave.</p>
<p>It was NATO's first formal discussion of which countries should be invited to join the West's defence club at a special summit in Madrid on July 8-9.</p>
<p>NATO sources said issue remained wide open with a compromise on four new members remaining a distinct possibility.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said a strong northern bloc of countries -- Britain, Germany, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands -- all indicated they still had an open mind on the subject. But NATO sources said all five also tended to support Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;This first discussion tells us very little about who will finally make it,&quot; said one alliance source.</p>
<p>In an attempt to avoid creating new divisions in Europe, the alliance pledged that the door would stay open after it admitted its first new members since 1982.</p>
<p>&quot;We recommend to our heads of state and government to make explicit our commitment the Alliance remains open to any other European state able and willing to fulfill the principles (of membership) and contribute to our common security,&quot; said a final communique.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers said the Madrid summit should &quot;give substance to this commitment.&quot;</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, charged with the highly-sensitive task of drawing up the list of successful countries, presented a report on the discussions with all applicants and an analysis of their respective chances.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and the former Yugoslav Repubic of Macedonia have all applied for membership.</p>
<p>Solana will now start work on a short list of candidates and visit their capitals to inform them of the results.</p>
<p>Officials say he hopes to have a final list ready by the end of June, barely a week before the Madrid summit to inaugurate a new security order intended to guarantee peace in Europe in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Tiny Slovenia, which fulfils many of the formal conditions, and Romania are backed strongly by France and Italy, but some countries fear absorbing as many as five new members would risk weakening the alliance.</p>
<p>Solana, fresh from negotiating a landmark security pact with Russia to run in parallel with NATO's expansion, insisted that only ministers could attend the session.</p>
<p>NATO has said any former communist country wishing to be considered must have established democratic control of its armed forces, set up a market economy and be attempting to make its forces compatible with those of the alliance.</p>
<p>But privately officials admit the decision on who to invite is essentially a political one and NATO capitals are desperate to avoid creating new tensions between those gaining admittance and those that do not.</p>
<p>Underlining this, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and others have been at pains to stress that the enlargement process will continue after Madrid and have also agreed an enhanced partnership programme for other states.</p>
