<p>An earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale jolted northeastern Iran on Thursday, causing no casualties as residents of the area were still living in tents following a stronger quake last month, the state radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, reports received so far indicate that there are no casualties,&quot; an official from the natural disasters headquarters in Khorasan province told the radio.</p>
<p>He said towns and villages near Qaen and Birjand towns &quot;were affected by the earthquake. Houses damaged in last month's earthquake sustained more serious damage&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, most of the inhabitants of these regions were living in tents and there was no need to dispatch more tents,&quot; the official told the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>The quake was the strongest to hit the area since May 10 when a force 7.1 earthquake killed more than 1,560 people, injured 2,600, left 50,000 homeless and levelled about 168 villages close to the towns of Qaen and Birjand.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said this week that most of those made homeless were still living in tents near their damaged villages and that Iranian authorities were expected to start rebuilding some of the ruined houses soon.</p>
<p>A Red Crescent official said relief teams had been sent on Thursday to the area, the official news agency IRNA reported.</p>
<p>Iran has been hit by at least three major earthquakes in the past year as well as scores of tremors and thousands of aftershocks that U.N. officials say have stretched the country's relief supplies to the limit.</p>
<p>Iran said this month it needed $100 million over the next 18 months to reconstruct regions devastated by the earthquakes. It said 30,500 housing units would be built in the area of the May 10 quake.</p>
