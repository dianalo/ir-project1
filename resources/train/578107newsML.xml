<p>Restive Grand Forks residents vented their frustration about the slow pace of recovery from last month's devastating flood while officials considered Tuesday whether to remake the town into a walled city.</p>
<p>Much of a four-hour city council meeting Monday night was spent airing gripes about the lack of power in half the city's 15,000 homes and the bureaucratic red tape they said was hampering their return.</p>
<p>Some people said they would leave Grand Forks altogether and move elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The frustration level at the city council meeting went up to a degree I've never seen before. They need answers; they've been asking questions for weeks,&quot; said businessman Hal Gershman, one of those heading up the recovery effort.</p>
<p>&quot;People's lives are in more turmoil than they've ever been before,&quot; he said. &quot;Families who do not have homes, families who are split up, families who have absolutely been torn apart.&quot;</p>
<p>A winter-like chill and morning snowfall Tuesday did not help the mood.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult questions at Monday's council meeting were raised by some of the 700 homeowners whose historic, Victorian houses would have to be cleared to make way for a permanent diking system envisioned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that may or may not protect the city.</p>
<p>&quot;All we're going to be doing is postponing this issue for our children. We're going to end up with a walled city, with very few people looking out and nobody looking in,&quot; said Gershman, who chairs the task force considering the dike issue.</p>
<p>&quot;If they want to widen the (river) channel ... I understand what they want to do and it makes a lot of sense,&quot; he said. &quot;But diking is not a permanent solution. The water is going to keep going up. So then what do you do? Twenty years from now we're right back where we started from, or maybe 10 years from now, maybe five, I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>Gershman said the city council took a frustrating hour at Monday's meeting discussing license fees for electrical inspectors, even as many residents complained about waiting for inspectors to approve work completed by electricians.</p>
<p>Complaints also focused on a newly enacted ordinance requiring residents to discard flood-damaged furnaces and hot water heaters even if they were useable.</p>
<p>City officials have said the total losses in Grand Forks alone could amount to $2 billion in ruined buildings, roads and possessions. Potentially billions more in flood damage was suffered across the Dakotas and Minnesota when the record winter snowpack melted last month.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, nearly all of Grand Forks and its neighbor, East Grand Forks, Minnesota, were submerged as the swollen Red River overwhelmed temporary dikes, forcing 60,000 residents to flee. A subsequent fire that burned unchecked for two days gutted several blocks of downtown Grand Forks.</p>
<p>The north-flowing river was finally expected to retreat back within its banks by this weekend for the first time since April 5, the National Weather Service said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens made her second lobbying trip to Washington, D.C., Tuesday, urging lawmakers to speed up passage of a multibillion-dollar federal disaster aid bill that has become bogged down by unrelated amendments.</p>
<p>Owens set up a local task force to address the various aspects of rebuilding but some residents have become fed up, having to trek miles every day from temporary lodging to continue the cleanup.</p>
