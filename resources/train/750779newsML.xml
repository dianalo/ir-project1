<headline>EU wins concessions, approves Boeing merger.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-07-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Commission on Wednesday recommended approval of a planned $15 billion merger between U.S. airplane makers Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>The European Union's 20-seat executive said it passed its recommendation, which averts the danger of a potentially damaging transatlantic trade row, to antitrust experts from the bloc's 15 member states who will review it by next week.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a broad agreement (in the Commission). The remedies the Commission was striving for have largely been supplied,&quot; Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert told a news conference.</p>
<p>Van Miert said the Commission would hand down its final decision on the merger next week, adding that he was confident a large majority of national experts would back the Commission.</p>
<p>Boeing, already the world's leading aircraft manufacturer, agreed to tone down key elements of its planned merger in order to win Brussels' approval. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has already given its go-ahead to the merger.</p>
<p>Van Miert said Boeing had accepted EU concerns about the company's long-term exclusive airplane supply contracts with three U.S. airlines.</p>
<p>Boeing agreed to remove all exclusive deals from contracts with American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines and forego such pacts for 10 more years, he said.</p>
<p>It had previously signed deals to supply its planes exclusively to the three carriers for over 20 years, effectively snuffing out its main rival, Europe's Airbus consortium, from large chunks of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a key problem - you're closing off an important part of the market,&quot; Van Miert said. &quot;This was a vital battle in terms of competition policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Boeing will also free up licences and patents from McDonnell Douglas's military research programmes to rival firms after the Commission had objected that Boeing could use defence funds to subsidise its commercial aircraft development.</p>
<p>In another concession, the U.S. giant undertook not to abuse its dominant market position to influence the important aircraft supplies sector.</p>
<p>Van Miert said he was concerned that the new merged group could persuade suppliers not to cooperate with Airbus, adding that this part of the deal would be closely monitored.</p>
<p>The climate of the talks as they approached their deadline had become increasingly confrontational, with Washington threatening to retaliate with possible trade sanctions if the EU Commission blocked the merger.</p>
<p>In Europe, French President Jacques Chirac claimed the merger was &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;.</p>
<p>Europe's Airbus is operated by a consortium of French, British, German and Spanish firms.</p>
<p>Boeing had previously dismissed Commission fears that the merger would strengthen its already dominant position in the commercial sector, arguing that McDonnell Douglas was no longer a serious competitor.</p>
<p>The EU executive has the power to block major mergers if it finds they can harm fair competition in the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>In the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas case, Brussels could have landed swingeing fines on the new group if it had gone ahead and merged despite an EU ban.</p>
