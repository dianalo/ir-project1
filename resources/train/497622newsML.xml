<p>Gold prices remained easier on Wednesday afternoon as the market edged back within its established range of $347.00-$350.00 per ounce, but palladium held most of its gains at a fresh 21-month high, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $347.80, down 20 cents from the morning fix and down $1.30 from Tuesday, after receiving little support from the New York and Far East markets.</p>
<p>The Comex June futures contract was $0.60 off at $350.60 around the fixing.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be moving lower and I would not be surprised if we re-visit the recent lows (around $336),&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Equally, he added, it would be no surprise to see bullion trade at $350.00 ahead of the Comex option expiry, due after the close of business on Friday.</p>
<p>Palladium was fixed at $357.00 after bouncing from a two-dollar fall on light profit-taking from a fresh 21-month high of $157.75 at the morning fix, $3.75 ahead of Tuesday 's fix.</p>
<p>Its last high since July 10, 1995 was $157.50 on March 11.</p>
<p>Dealers noted that nearby supplies had tightened and the market had moved into a backwardation of around $10 this month.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of Japanese interest,&quot; one dealer said, referring to the Russian-Japanese supply contract delay.</p>
<p>Lease rates were also higher with one month quoted at 10 percent from six percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Russia, the world's leading palladium exporter, and Japan, the major importer, have yet to discuss contracts for supplies which ended in November last year. No palladium exports licences have been signed by the Russian prime minister and no exports are forecast this month or next, according to Russian officials.</p>
<p>Japanese importers have been buying on the dealer market, pushing up prices and attracting the attention of speculators, whose interest has firmed prices further.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a lot of buying by one or two parties but they have not been lending, which has pushed out the backwardation,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Its sister metal platinum was much less moved and was indicated a dollar firmer at $366.00/$367.00 in the middle of an overall $360-$370 range.</p>
<p>Silver was also barely moving in a tight two-cent range most of the day. It was last at $4.78/$4.80 unchanged.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was some pressure in silver and it could be heading for its $4.72 support after retracing from a $4.83 high on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
