<headline>BASEBALL-ROOKIE WINS BATTLE OF VENEZUELANS AS CUBS BEAT GIANTS.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-08-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rookie Jeremi Gonzalez won the pitching battle with his fellow Venezuelan and longtime idol Wilson Alvarez and Sammy Sosa hit a two-run homer as the Chicago Cubs defeated the San Francisco Giants 6-3 Thursday.</p>
<p>Gonzalez (8-5) allowed two runs over 6 2/3 innings, yielding four hits and walking two with five strikeouts. He snapped a personal three-game losing streak and moved within two victories of becoming the first Cubs rookie to post double digits in victories since Mike Harkey in 1990.</p>
<p>Alvarez and Gonzalez are both from Maracaibo, Venezuela.</p>
<p>&quot;My parents told me that if I won this game I would get a gift -- a car or an apartment,&quot; Gonzalez said. &quot;The whole town shut down to watch this game on television. Wilson has been my idol and I have followed him since I was a teenager. I had total concentration. I'll never forget this game.&quot;</p>
<p>Sosa hit his 24th homer in the fifth inning to stake the Cubs to a 3-0 lead against Alvarez, who was returning to the city where he spent his first seven seasons with the White Sox before being traded to San Francisco on July 31.</p>
<p>The left-hander (1-1) allowed three runs and seven hits over six innings, walking two and striking out three.</p>
<p>&quot;I threw pretty good,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;What can I say? I wanted to throw the pitch to Sammy inside and I put it over the plate. You can't make mistakes to a hitter like that.&quot;</p>
<p>The loss snapped the Giants' four-game winning streak and cut their lead over second-place Los Angeles to 1 1/2 games in the National League West.</p>
<p>The Cubs' Brian McRae, who entered the game in an 0-for-10 slump, went 3-for-4 with a homer, two runs scored and a stolen base. J.T. Snow hit his 19th homer for the Giants.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, Denny Neagle allowed just five hits over 7 2/3 innings to become the first 16-game winner in the National League and Ryan Klesko drove in a pair of runs as the Braves blanked the St. Louis Cardinals 3-0.</p>
<p>Neagle (16-2) walked one and struck out seven to extend his career-high scoreless streak to 23 2/3 innings. He is 4-0 in his last six starts.</p>
<p>Mark Wohlers pitched a scoreless ninth for his 27th save. Todd Stottlemyre (11-8) took the loss.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Mike Piazza had three RBI on four hits, including a two-run homer, and Raul Mondesi and Brett Butler each drove in two runs, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 9-4 victory over the Expos.</p>
<p>In the three-game series, Piazza was 9-for-14 with three homers and seven RBI.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Rex Hudler, activated from the disabled list before the game, singled in Ricky Otero with one out in the 11th to lift the Phillies past the Houston Astros, 6-5.</p>
<p>Hudler, who also hit a two-run homer in the seventh, had been sidelined since June 9 and underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee three days later.</p>
<p>Philadelphia, which has the worst record in the major leagues, has won eight of its last 10 games.</p>
<p>The Astros have dropped a season-high four straight after winning 13 of their previous 15 contests. Their lead over Pittsburgh in the Central Division shrank to four games.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Jason Kendall hit a two-run homer and five pitchers combined on a seven-hitter to lead the Pirates to a 5-1 victory over the Florida Marlins.</p>
<p>Pirates starter Francisco Cordova was ejected with no outs in the second inning by home plate umpire Jerry Layne for hitting Moises Alou one pitch after surrendering a home run to Darren Daulton. Both benches emptied but order was restored.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh manager Gene Lamont was later ejected by second base umpire and crew chief Joe West when he came out to protest Cordova's ejection.</p>
<p>In New York, Carlos Baerga, making his first start since July 29, went 4-for-4 with a homer, four RBI and three runs scored, and the Mets scored six times in the seventh en route to a 12-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies.</p>
<p>The Mets, shut out by Colorado rookie John Thomson the night before, erupted to match their second-best offensive output of the season.</p>
<p>Mark Clark (8-7), who has been nursing a blister on the index finger of his throwing hand, went the distance, allowing eight hits and a walk with four strikeouts.</p>
<p>In Cincinnati Brett Tomko (7-3) combined with Scott Sullivan on a four-hitter as the Reds blanked the slumping San Diego Padres 7-0.</p>
<p>Joe Oliver and Eduardo Perez homered and Willie Greene added a bases-loaded double for the Reds, who won for just the third time in nine games.</p>
<p>The Padres have dropped four of their last five. Tony Gwynn was 0-for-4 and is hitless in consecutive games for just the second time this season. His average fell to .384.</p>
