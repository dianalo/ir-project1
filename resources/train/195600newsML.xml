<p>Most Asian countries are looking forward to European economic and monetary union and the new Euro currency, predicting a subsequent investment surge in their currencies, foreign exchange dealers at a conference here said.</p>
<p>&quot;Asian currencies are just going to take off,&quot; Chris Pavlou, Asia-Pacific regional executive of the Association Cambiste Internationale (ACI), told Reuters at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Even now, the volume of Indonesian rupiah trade is greater than that of the Italian lira, while volume in Thai baht is higher than that of all the Scandinavian currencies combined,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Jaime Panganiban, president of Forex Philippines, agreed. &quot;This will have a very positive impact on (Asian) investment. After all, all the European crosses will disappear. We'll have only Euro/dollar, Euro/yen, and then the Euro against the emerging markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Current expectations are that European economic and monetary union (EMU), set to take place on Jan. 1, 1999, will initially include Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>This would result in a &quot;hard,&quot; rather than a &quot;soft,&quot; single Euro currency, analysts say, and has caused some concern in Japan, one of the few Asian countries more uncertain than positive about EMU.</p>
<p>A senior official at Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said that while a hard Euro currency was desirable from a world point of view, it could adversely affect the yen by creating a competing currency.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's a strong Euro, as the mark has been up to now, there's the chance that many central banks will think it's better to hold Euros than yen in their foreign reserves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's a soft Euro, this could lead to increased holdings of dollars or yen, and the yen could strengthen, &quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Eugene Prim, president of ACI, said he felt there would be virtually no losers after the advent of EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will be positive in the early stage for the major currencies, then we will see the new European currencies emerge, such as the Czech crown. And then in the third stage, the Asian currencies will develop,&quot; he told Reuters, adding that this would take about two to three years after EMU.</p>
<p>Pavlou said that Asian currencies were likely to strengthen across the board, and that while the yen could perhaps lose a little ground initially, it too was likely to see some gains.</p>
<p>A dealer with a Japanese bank noted that investment in the Philippine peso is currently hampered by difficulties such as low market liquidity and the lack of a secondary market, which prevents investors from hedging their risks. Burdensome reporting rules also remain.</p>
<p>But dealers felt the necessary deregulation is only a matter of time, pointing to recent moves such as the liberalisation of foreign bank entry into the Philippine market.</p>
<p>Pavlou said that after EMU there could be a flow of significant amounts of Japanese capital into the region, as normally risk-shy Japanese investors turn from Europe and the U.S. to higher yields and new opportunities.</p>
<p>Rabboni Arjonillo, vice-president of Global Finance at Citibank N.A. in Manila, agreed. &quot;The event of one currency for all of Europe is an attraction for a lot of traders to look for new ways and new currencies to invest in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering that Asia is now the fastest growing region in the world, and that the world is awash in cash, this leaves no other alternative but to go to Asia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers were in Manila for a conference of Asia-Pacific forex dealers, which ended Friday.</p>
