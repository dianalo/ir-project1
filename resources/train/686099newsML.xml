<p>President Bill Clinton hailed the late French deep-sea explorer Jacques Cousteau on Wednesday as a man of &quot;rare insight and extraordinary spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While we mourn his death, it is far more appropriate that we celebrate his remarkable life, and the gifts he gave to all of us,&quot; Clinton said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Clinton said Cousteau, who died on Wednesday aged 87, &quot;enabled mankind to truly become part of the sea and the creatures that live there&quot; by helping to invent scuba gear and creating the first one-person submarine.</p>
<p>&quot;Through his many documentaries, movies and television specials, Capt. Cousteau showed us both the importance of the world's oceans and the beauty that lies within. We are all far richer, and more caring, for his having shared his time on Earth with the human family,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Vice President Al Gore called Cousteau a hero and said he learned a great deal from the French sea explorer.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a giant in every respect,&quot; Gore said in an interview with the Cable News Network.</p>
<p>&quot;We had an opporunity to work together and I always learned a tremendous amount from him. He was a hero to men, women and children all over the world and we will miss him greatly. Our sympathies go to his family,&quot; Gore said.</p>
