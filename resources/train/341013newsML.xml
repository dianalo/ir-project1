<title>USA: CME live cattle mostly lower on weak cash markets.</title>
<headline>CME live cattle mostly lower on weak cash markets.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Falling fed cattle and beef prices knocked nearby CME live and feeder cattle futures lower at the close while deferred months were underpinned by projections for USDA's cattle inventory data due out Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.675 cent a lb lower to 0.150 higher with February off 0.600 at 63.975 cents and April off most at 65.900. Only October posted a gain and set a contract high.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle ended 0.075 to 0.425 cent lower with March off most at 69.000 cents.</p>
<p>The break in live cattle futures was partly sparked by falling boxed beef values, traders aid. They said retailers appear to have most of their needs covered into mid February which pressured wholesale beef prices. Packers in turn, were forced to drop bids for fed cattle.</p>
<p>&quot;The declining wholesale (beef) price finally caught up to the live cash market today,&quot; said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst for Alaron Trading corp.</p>
<p>The price for heavier-weight choice beef slipped to $96.84 per cwt at noon, the lowest price since May 7, 1996.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices eased to $64 per cwt, the lowest level since early August and $1.00 down from last week's top.  </p>
<p>Adding to losses in April live cattle was active fund liquidation which touched off sell stops on the setback. Fund liquidation was heavy under 66.000 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle followed on spillover weakness with profit taking also evident after a rally earlier this week boosted values to new contract highs, they said.</p>
<p>However, deferreds months in both pits were underpinned by bullish projections for Friday's semi-annual Cattle Inventory report as well as the recent large number of death loss from storms and bitter cold, they said.</p>
<p>Analyst projections on the inventory report averaged 98.1 percent of last year, or 101.83 million head, for total U.S. cattle numbers on January 1. Actual numbers ranged from 100.9 to 103.8 million head, 97 to 100.2 percent of last year.</p>
<p>Shatkin notably sold April live cattle on the setback. Cargill Investor Services and E.D.&amp;F. Man bought February which curbed losses in that month. Refco notably sold May feeders while buying March against scattered selling, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In live cattle options, commission house liquidation continued in February by buying 64 puts. Some traders also bought out-of-the-money April puts and selling calls.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $0.22 at $69.55 per cwt.</p>
