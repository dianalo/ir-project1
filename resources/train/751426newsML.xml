<p>Turkey's opposition suffered more losses on Wednesday when the former Islamist-led government's economy minister joined the new secularist coalition and two MPs resigned from their parties.</p>
<p>Anatolian news agency said Ufuk Soylemez, the previous state minister responsible for the economy, joined the small Democratic Turkey Party, junior partners in Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's left-right coalition.</p>
<p>One MP resigned from ex-prime minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party and another deputy quit the True Path Party, headed by previous foreign minister Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>A year-long coalition between the Islamists and conservative Ciller collapsed last month under pressure from the secularist army.</p>
<p>Defections and resignations by True Path deputies dissatisfied with the alliance have taken the party to 93 seats from the 135 it won at the last election in December, 1995.</p>
<p>Democratic Turkey Party leader Husamettin Cindoruk was quoted in newspapers on Wednesday as saying he expected more MPs to join his group, originally a splinter from True Path.</p>
<p>Cindoruk's party, now with 18 deputies, needs just two more members to qualify for places on important government commissions which are still controlled by members of the previous coalition.</p>
