<p>Rhone-Poulenc Australia will next month suspend gallium extraction at its Pinjarra facility in western Australia in the face of disappointing demand, parent Rhone-Poulenc Chimie said on Monday.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc Chimie is a division of French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group Rhone-Poulenc.</p>
<p>&quot;Closing operations will start in early June and will be completed by end July,&quot; a company spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>In a statement the company said that after a strong growth in 1994 and 1995, gallium demand was below expectations, particularly in Japan, where it declined.</p>
<p>Growth in high-frequency integrated circuits did not offset lower demand for light-emitting diodes, the main market for gallium, it said.</p>
<p>Other applications such as gallium dental amalgams were still limited while its potential applications for industrial catalysts was not yet clear.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc Chimie said that its stocks levels and output at its other two existing facilities of Stade, Germany, and Salindres, France, will be sufficient to meet current demand.</p>
<p>Annual gallium's extraction capacity at Pinjarra is 50 tonnes. Extraction's capacity at Stade is 20 tonnes and processing capacity at Salingres is of over 70 tonnes, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She also said that the group had the expertise to restart production at Pinjarra &quot;rather quickly&quot; if market conditions improved.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc started the Pinjarra plant in 1989 for an initial investment of A$50 million. But it was forced to suspend production in 1990 due to slow demand. It reopened the plant in early 1996.</p>
