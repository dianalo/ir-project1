<headline>Veba confirms meeting with BT chief.</headline>
<dateline>DUESSELDORF, Germany 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>German utility Veba AG on Thursday confirmed that its chairman Ulrich Hartmann met this week with Ian Vallance, the chairman of British Telecom Plc, but denied there were cooperation talks.</p>
<p>The statement follows a report in a German newspaper which said that Veba and BT were holding high-level talks about a possible alliance in telecommunications after the departure of Cable and Wireless from its alliance with Veba.  </p>
<p>&quot;Hartmann and Vallance know each other from earlier times and get together frequently for personal reasons,&quot; said a Veba spokeswoman.</p>
<p>&quot;But you cannot therefore draw the conclusion that British Telecom is the international telecommunications partner that Veba has been looking for,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The daily Berliner Zeitung reported on Thursday that Hartmann and Vallance had met to discuss such a cooperation.</p>
<p>BT has declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>British Telecom already has a strategic alliance with German utility Viag and the two companies recently won Germany's fourth digital cellular telephone licence.</p>
<p>The BT-Viag group is widely considered the weakest of three major alliances forming in Germany to challenge monopoly Deutsche Telekom when markets are opened to competition next year.</p>
<p>The Berliner Zeitung reported that BT was &quot;more than dissatisfied&quot; with its alliance with Viag.</p>
<p>Veba recently sealed its telecoms joint venture with utility RWE AG, which is called O.TEL.O, and said it was in talks with several international companies to replace the departing Cable and Wireless.</p>
