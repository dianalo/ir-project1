<headline>Lasmo more bullish on find than Pakistan.</headline>

<p>Lasmo Plc said on Tuesday that it newly discovered gas field in Pakistan had estimated reserves of about two trillion cubic feet (tcf).</p>
<p>The announcement follows a more cautious statement by the Pakistani government, which on Monday said estimated reserves were more than one trillion cubic feet.</p>
<p>Lasmo, which made the find in the Kirthar Concession and evaluated the results, said the difference stemmed from a more conservative risk assesment by Pakistan.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty, but the mid-point in our view is two tcf. We think the Pakistan government is very conservative,&quot; a Lasmo spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Reserves of two tcf would translate in a share for Lasmo of about 130 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is about twice Lasmo's 1996 production, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>&quot;This is in potential a significant discovery,&quot; he said. &quot;It also adds value to the remainder of the Kirthar concession and also the adjacent concession which we were awarded in January.&quot;</p>
<p>Lasmo still has to do seismic research and more drilling before actually booking any reserves. But some reserves might already be booked by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The two trillion may turn out to be one or it may turn out out to be significantly more. By next year we should have a much clearer view,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>A decision whether to develop the field may be taken in 1999, while the first production might come on stream in 2001 if all goes smoothly, he said.</p>
<p>Lasmo and Shell Exploration Pakistan BV both have a 47.5 percent working interest in Kirthar. Pakistan's state-owned Oil and Gas Development Corporation has 5.0 percent, but has the right to back in for 20 percent.</p>
