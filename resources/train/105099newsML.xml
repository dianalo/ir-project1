<title>MEXICO: Mexican peso ends sharply weaker on rates.</title>
<headline>Mexican peso ends sharply weaker on rates.</headline>

<p>Mexico's peso recovered from an earlier bout of speculation in late trade on Wednesday but still closed sharply weaker following Tuesday night's falls in primary interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in interest rates was the cue for long-awaited adjustment in the exchange rate, which the export sector, among others, have been asking for,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour counterpart were 4.1 and 3.9 centavos weaker, respectively, at 7.5850/7.5890 and 7.5810/7.5850 per dollar.  </p>
<p>The 48-hour peso tested support at 7.60 per dollar during the session.</p>
<p>The peso had been under pressure since early trade from dealers covering positions in dollars, and was weakened further by foreign investors stepping out of the money market.</p>
<p>&quot;The importance of all this is that the peso is consolidating at new levels...foreigners are showing signs that they are not interested in renewing money market investments at current rates,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Speculative buying of dollars was also partly responsible for weakening the peso and increasing volume compared to recent sessions, traders said.</p>
<p>The same-day peso earlier closed 3.2 centavos weaker at 7.5650/7.5700 per dollar.</p>
<p>Traders expected the dollars in the 48-hour market to be in demand on Thursday, as they do not have to be paid for until after the weekend.</p>
