<title>USA: Schwab posts 21 percent rise in profits.</title>
<headline>Schwab posts 21 percent rise in profits.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Charles Schwab Corp. said Friday that its profits rose by 21 percent in the third quarter as the brokerage firm's 1996 revenues and net income continued to grow at a record pace.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company said its net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $57.1 million, or 32 cents a share, from $47.2 million, or 26 cents a share, despite shifting market conditions.</p>
<p>Revenues for the quarter rose to $430 million from $385.5 million, the company said, adding that both revenue and net income for the first nine months of the year were the highest in its history.</p>
<p>The company said that so far this year it earned $174.1 million, or 97 cents a share, on revenues of $1.37 billion, up from net income of $130 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenues of $1.03 billion.</p>
<p>Schwab, which has 235 branch offices across the country and also offers electronic trading, said its commission revenues were comparable to the year-ago period but strong growth in non-trading revenues helped it post a 12 percent overall increase in revenues for the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;While revenue growth for the quarter fell short of our long-term threshold of 20 percent annual growth, year-to-date growth in revenues and earnings per share exceeds 30 percent,&quot; Chairman Charles Schwab said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Our flexible cost structure and ongoing focus on expenses enabled the company to achieve a 13 percent after-tax profit margin and an annualized return on equity of 29 percent for the quarter, exceeding our long-term thresholds of 10 and 20 percent, respectively,&quot; Schwab added.</p>
<p>Schwab's stock gained $1.25 to $24.25 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
