<p>The first group of women at The Citadel started class on Monday and were off to a good start, officials at the military college said.</p>
<p>The new cadets, who include four women, wore the standard physical training clothes of navy T-shirts and shorts but were breaking in their dress uniform patent leather shoes as they learned military posture and how to address upper classmen.</p>
<p>&quot;The women seem to be doing fine, and so do the men,&quot; Brig. Gen. Clifton Poole, acting president of the college, told reporters. The Citadel dropped its 153-year-old all-male policy this summer after the U.S. Supreme Court said a similar rule at Virginia Military Institution, the nation's only other state-funded all-male school, was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Last year, one woman, Shannon Faulkner, was admitted to The Citadel under a federal court order but dropped out after a week, citing stress and isolation. The four women and 581 men in The Citadel's first truly coeducational class started the day at 5:20 a.m. on Monday with reveille.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past we were single gender. I wish we were still single gender, but the law of the land is we cannot continue this path,&quot; Poole said. &quot;What we're focusing on now is trying to focus our energy on making the new role successful.&quot;</p>
<p>By noon the new cadets had been addressed by the commandant and regimental commander and visited the cadet store, tailor shop and barber shop.</p>
<p>The women -- Petra Lovetinska, Nancy Mace, Jeanie Mentavlos and Kim Messer -- did not get the traditional cut given to knobs -- the new students so dubbed because of their shaved heads, nor was it a standard military cut. Instead, they got a haircut similar to a man's crew cut.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic standards of the hair cut is off the face, off the shoulders, off the collar,&quot; Poole said.</p>
<p>The Citadel went through a &quot;painstaking&quot; procedure to assure that the female cadets receive female haircuts, designed with the assistance of a local hair salon, said Col. Joseph Trez, commandant of cadets.</p>
<p>The media were prohibited from interviewing new cadets but some upperclassmen said they were surprised at how short the women had to cut their hair.</p>
