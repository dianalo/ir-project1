<p>Accelerated growth in Latin American oil production will outpace rising consumption allowing exports from the region to double in ten years, oil executives said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Latin America is a net exporter of oil, and with oil production growth far outstripping consumption, exports are set to grow yet further,&quot; British Petroleum chief economist Peter Davies told the annual Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES) conference.</p>
<p>Davies said oil production growth, led by Venezuela, was projected by BP to rise at six percent per annum in the ten years to 2005, reaching 15 million barrels per day (bpd) from just under ten million at present.</p>
<p>Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Bolivia all plan rising hydrocarbons output.</p>
<p>Latin America was set to emulate Asia with economic growth prospects for the region as a whole of about five percent per annum over the next decade compared to two percent over the last ten years, Davies said.</p>
<p>But oil consumption would lag economic growth, he said.</p>
<p>Oil demand growth was put at three percent a year, implying exports at 6-7 million bpd by 2005, up from some three million bpd now, Davies said.</p>
<p>&quot;Oil production is set to grow increasingly rapidly, partly as a result of the 'apertura' process which is opening up the doors for international partnerships in the development of both oil and gas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mobil Latin America President Ron Billings said he saw demand for transport fuels leading a three percent a year increase in oil products demand.</p>
<p>&quot;There's plenty of room for per capita demand to grow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Regional consumption should rise to 7.6 million bpd in 2005 from 5.8 million bpd in 1995, Billings estimated.</p>
<p>This would require 150,000 bpd per year of incremental oil product supply &quot;equal to the addition of one medium size refinery per year.&quot;</p>
<p>That could be achieved by raising regional refinery operating rates from 80 percent pct to 90 percent by the end of the decade, said Billings.</p>
<p>But he warned that over the longer term if refinery output did not match rising consumption the region could shift from being net exporter of oil products to a net importer.</p>
<p>Davies said oil consumption would be &quot;tempered somewhat&quot; by the already relatively high car stock and competition from gas.</p>
<p>CGES chairman former Saudi Oil Minister Zaki Yamani projected net exports of oil from Latin America to rise to 5.5 million bpd in 2006 from 3.7 million bpd at present.</p>
<p>&quot;With proven reserves amounting to 13 pct of the world total and production at only 8.5 pct, Latam oil appears under exploited,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 1996, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia accounted for 33 percent of U.S. crude and oil product imports, up from 24 pct in 1990.</p>
<p>By contrast, Saudi Arabia's share fell by 2 pct to 15 pct over the same period.</p>
<p>Total President Thierry Desmarest said Latin America would provide one of three regional pillars for company oil production outside the Middle East.</p>
<p>Total's Latin American operations would contribute 150,000 barrels a day equivalent (boe) of oil and gas next year from 85,000 boe this year, he said.</p>
<p>Total, which has already been given government approval for a $3 billion heavy oil project in Venezuela's Orinoco region, is also considering investment possibilities in Bolivia and Brazil,&quot; said Desmarest.</p>
<p>&quot;We are preparing for a possible market opening in Mexico,&quot; he added.</p>
