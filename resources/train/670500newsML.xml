<p>The economy kept growing in May and early June though &quot;pockets&quot; of weakness&quot; appeared, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, in the clearest sign yet that the central bank will not raise interest rates next month.</p>
<p>In its so-called Beige Book summary of economic activity, the Fed said there were signs of a slowdown in several regions and that only scattered wage or price pressures were evident.</p>
<p>The report reinforced the growing view that the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee will hold rates steady at its meeting July 1-2.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line here is that the economic picture is unfolding exactly how the FOMC would like to see it,&quot; said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&quot;Consequently, there is little chance the Fed is going to hike interest rates in July,&quot; Sohn said.</p>
<p>Fed policy-makers will use the Beige Book findings when they meet to weigh their next move on rates in two weeks. The Fed held short-term rates steady last month after raising them a quarter point in March, the first increase in more than two years, in a bid to slow growth and ward off inflation.</p>
<p>Unlike the last Beige Book report May 7 that said the economy &quot;continued to expand,&quot; the latest report was peppered with references to a slowdown.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer spending was weaker ... with several districts reporting slower growth in retail and auto sales,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Manufacturing was brisk and growing in many regions &quot;but there were some areas of weakening.&quot; Construction and real estate were generally strong &quot;but some districts reported pockets of weak growth,&quot; said the report, prepared by the Dallas Fed bank based on interviews conducted before June 9.</p>
<p>Inflation pressures remained remarkably muted.</p>
<p>Despite shortages of professional and blue-collar workers, most districts reported &quot;little or no wage pressure or noted that pressures were confined to a few markets,&quot; the Fed said.</p>
<p>Similarly, while prices for energy and for some metals used in manufacturing were rising, there was little upward pressure on prices of finished goods.</p>
<p>The Fed said &quot;retail and manufacturing prices were being held in check by heavy competition, which was stimulating continued cost reduction or productivity increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Norwest's Sohn said it was unusual that the lowest unemployment since November 1973 was not spurring wage inflation driven by demands for higher pay.</p>
<p>The economy grew at a brisk 5.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the strongest growth in nine years, largely on a surge in consumer spending. But recent data have pointed to a slowdown in the current quarter.</p>
<p>Still, the economy remains relatively strong after more than six years of growth. The Fed summary said manufacturers in several regions said they were producing nearly flat out in May.</p>
<p>Steel producers in the Chicago area said their capacity use remained &quot;very high,&quot; the Fed said. Plants were being expanded in the Atlanta region while executives in Dallas and St. Louis said demand was rising for construction goods.</p>
