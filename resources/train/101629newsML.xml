<title>USA: Webster targets cost savings in merger.</title>
<headline>Webster targets cost savings in merger.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-08</dateline>

<p>Webster Financial Corp chief financial officer John Brennan said Tuesday the company believes it can achieve cost savings of $6 million to $7 million in the first year of its merger with DS Bancor.</p>
<p>Brennan said in a telephone interview cost savings would rise to more than $10 million in the second year. He said Webster calculated that it would require $4 million in annual savings to result in zero dilution.  </p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Webster said in a news release that it expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>Brent DiGiorgio, a spokesman for Webster, said the merger would result in branch consolidations and there would be some job eliminatons but he declined to provide any figures.</p>
<p>Webster, a Waterbury, Conn.-based holding company, operates 63 banking offices in central Connecticut and DS Bancor operates 23 Derby Savings Bank branches mostly in south central Connecticut.  </p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 1997 and to be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Webster said it expects to recognize acquisition-related charges of approximately $15 million after tax.</p>
<p>Webster is acquiring DS Bancor for about $137 million in a stock transaction in which DS Bancor holders will receive $43 per share in Webster common stock. The exchange ratio is subject to a &quot;collar&quot; adjustment depending on the level of Webster's stock.  </p>
<p>The merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of both companies and by regulators.</p>
<p>Webster Financial was off 5/8 to 34-5/8 in late trading.</p>
<p>Analyst Kevin Timmons of First Albany Corp said some investors may be skeptical about the cost saving targets because DS Bancor, with $1.3 billion in assets, is a a fairly large acquisition for the $3.8 billion asset Webster. The analyst added, &quot;They have a pretty big hurdle to overcome but I think they can do it.&quot;  </p>
<p>The analyst said Webster has done about six deals in three or four years and met its targets each time.</p>
<p>DS Bancor was up 2-17/64 to 40-41/64 in late trading.</p>
