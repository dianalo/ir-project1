<title>UK: GEC to reposition as defence world leader.</title>

<p>Britain's General Electric Co Plc said on Tuesday it was embarking on a new strategy, moving away from a joint venture culture towards a GEC-managed group focused on defence and aerospace, industrial electronics and communications.</p>
<p>It also said it was in active talks with Alcatel Alsthom Cie Generale d'Electricite' to determine the future of GEC Alsthom, the two companies' rail and power joint venture.  </p>
<p>The company also unveiled annual profits before tax and exceptional charges of 1.01 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) compared with 1.00 billion previously.</p>
<p>The market had been looking for profits to come in at around 1.04 billion pounds.</p>
<p>GEC said the repositiong of its jointly-owned telecoms group GPT was under review with Siemens AG. GEC owns 60 percent of GPT and Siemens 40 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The ambitious repositioning strategy...is designed to build (GEC's defence arm) Marconi into a global player, spanning all three principle defence electronic markets - America, Europe and the East,&quot; said managing director George Simpson, who took the helm at GEC from Lord Weinstock in September 1996.</p>
<p>The review comes against a backdrop of mounting pressure for the European defence industry to consolidate after mega-mergers in the U.S. between Lockheed Martin Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp plus Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>Simpson said the investment needed to fulfil the company's growth strategy would be financed out of GEC's cash resources. He added that any surplus cash would be remitted to shareholders.</p>
