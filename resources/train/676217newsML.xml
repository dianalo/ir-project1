<p>Late fund selling in active months of CME live cattle futures pressured prices into the close while feeders held gains with commercial and commission house demand offsetting earlier fund selling, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.225 cent per lb higher to 0.350 lower with only June up and August off 0.275 at 63.450 cents. Feeder cattle were up 0.300 to 0.050 with August up most at 77.300.</p>
<p>Mixed selling erased early gains in live cattle futures except in June, and prompted fund liquidation. June held its gains ahead of expiration on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Pressure continued to reflect expectations cash beef and cattle markets may have put in a near term top and the seasonal trend will be to move lower, they said.</p>
<p>R.J. O'Brien and Cargill Investor Services sold August after buying early, traders said. In live cattle options commercials were hedging in October, buying 66 puts and selling 68 calls. Commission houses sold august 64 calls, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Best levels were pared in feeder cattle late although prices remained supported as scattered commercial buying offset early carryover fund selling, traders said.  </p>
<p>Strong fundamentals, including a nearly three-year high in the CME feeder cattle index, prompted demand in the feeder pit. Expectations that feed costs will decline going into the harvest period, particularly with recent weather called conducive to crop development through most of the Midwest, added to overall support, they said.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index climbed another $0.27, to $78.03 per cwt, a new high for the move and highest level since August, 18, 1994. The index is a barometer for U.S. cash feeder cattle prices.</p>
<p>Boneless beef futures firmed in thin dealings as traders voiced caution over the upcoming seasonal moves in beef. Boneless should stay strong until after the Independence Day holiday and then prices were seen tumbling through the summer before strengthing again before the Labor Day holiday, traders said.</p>
<p>However, trimming showed continued commercial support. Commercials bought October against spreading of long August/short October by spreades, they said.</p>
<p>Boneless beef closed up 0.50 cent per lb to off 0.10 cent with August up most at 94.50 cents. Trimmings ended up 0.20 to 0.40 with August up 0.20 at 42.60 cents.</p>
