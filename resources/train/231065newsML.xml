<p>The Australian federal budget will remain in deficit on average through the ups and downs of the economy even after the government's planned fiscal tightening takes effect, forecaster Access Economics said.</p>
<p>&quot;After allowing for the spending cuts and revenue increases in the 1996/97 (July-June) budget, we estimate the structural underlying budget deficit at A$8.4 billion in 1996/97 and A$4.7 billion in 1997/98,&quot; Access said in its twice-annual Budget Monitor review released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government is forecasting an underlying deficit of A$5.6 billion in 1996/97, falling to A$1.5 billion in 1997/98.  </p>
<p>However, Access argued that these figures had benefited from the long run of above-trend economic growth experienced since the 1990-91 recession. &quot;Or, in other words, the federal budget may not be as recession-proof as the current official line has it, so either the budget will remain, on average, in the red, or the government will have to set itself harder targets,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Parliamentary obstruction is threatening even the fiscal tightening that the government is trying to put into effect.</p>
<p>Of the A$7.2 billion that new measures would save in 1997/98, A$2 billion is at risk in the Senate, the upper house.  </p>
<p>&quot;We envisage an economy in worse shape than seen in the official figures in both 1996/97 and 1999/00, but a better one in 1997/98 and 1998/99,&quot; the consultancy said.</p>
<p>&quot;The pattern underlies our forecasts of the budget headline and underlying balance in the years ahead -- labour market weakness in 1996/97 will give way to output and employment strength in the following two years, before the world and Australian economies slow at the end of the decade,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The government's figuring assumes even growth of 3.25 percent to 3.5 percent for the next few years.  </p>
<p>Access argues that the long run of good growth since 1992 has put the economy above its trend level.</p>
<p>So the government is assuming that it will remain there, by continuing trend annual growth into the future.</p>
<p>The alternative theory is that, after unusual strength, the economy will now slow to return output levels back to its trendline.</p>
<p>The underlying budget balance excludes proceeds from asset sales and similar capital transactions.</p>
<p>Access forecast actual underlying budget balances of minus A$6.5 billion in 1996/97 (that is, a deficit), minus A$1.6 billion in 1997/98, plus A$2.8 billion in 1998/99 and A$4.3 billion in 1999/00.</p>
<p>By comparison, the government forecasts underlying balances for those years of, respectively, minus A$5.6 billion, minus A$1.5 billion, plus A$957 million and A$5.7 billion.</p>
<p>Access said it was more positive for 1998/99 than the government because of its economic outlook. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730</p>
