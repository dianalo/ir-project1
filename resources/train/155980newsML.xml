<p>China is to restart horse races that were halted in 1987 because of poor equipment and shortages of capital, a sports official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The '96 China Cup Horse-Racing Open would be held next month in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province, Huang Wei, vice-secretary of the China Horsemanship Association, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>China halted sport horse-racing nine years ago because of poor conditions at race tracks, but races held for audiences willing to bet on the outcome were permitted to continue.</p>
<p>Gambling is illegal in China, but race course owners say their activities are within the law because punters win a fixed percentage of the takings for each race.</p>
<p>Conditions at the Guangzhou track had been much improved since 1987, Huang said, adding that betting would be forbidden at the races.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a sports activity... we do not have any activities involving gambling,&quot; he said, adding that the races would be financed by the Guangzhou track, a main venue for betting races.</p>
<p>Other such tracks are in the capital Beijing and on an island off eastern Shandong province.</p>
