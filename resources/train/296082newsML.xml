<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. peace negotiator Dennis Ross held further talks on a Hebron deal under the shadow of Tel Aviv bombings that wounded 13 people.</p>
<p>Army Radio said the session ended in the early hours of Friday without any breakthrough.</p>
<p>Israeli police said they believed that Arabs planted the nail-packed bombs that blew up in trash bins near Tel Aviv's central bus station on Thursday.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, visiting the wounded in hospital, pledged to respond with &quot;extreme severity&quot; if it emerged the bombers came from Palestinian self-rule areas.</p>
<p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts, a week after an off-duty Israeli soldier shot into a crowd of Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron, wounding seven Arabs. Militant Moslem groups vowed to avenge the attack.</p>
<p>The bombs exploded several kilometres (miles) from Netanyahu's Tel Aviv office while he met Ross, struggling to end an Israel-PLO impasse over a deal on Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron and dates for further pullbacks in the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;We raised various ideas but the conversation was cut off by the attack and for this reason I have nothing to announce to you,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters at Tel Aviv's Ichilov hospital.</p>
<p>Netanyahu and Ross resumed their meeting later, a sign that Israel was taking no action for now to slow or stop diplomatic efforts to clinch a Hebron deal.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was waiting for the outcome of Ross's meeting with Netanyahu to determine whether he should leave for a European trip on Friday, PLO officials said.</p>
<p>At the hospital, the right-wing Netanyahu held out the possibility of a stronger Israeli response to the blasts.</p>
<p>&quot;According to all the signs, it appears to be a terrorist attack,&quot; he said. &quot;If it becomes clear that the terrorists who carried out this attack came from the Palestinian Authority (area), we will respond with extreme severity.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if the bombings would affect the Hebron talks, which have dragged on for months, Netanyahu said: &quot;We will wage the battle against the terrorists and we will also check if these terrorists came from the area of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>&quot;(If they did), it should not be automatically assumed that we will carry on,&quot; he said, referring to peace negotiations with the PLO.</p>
<p>Asked about Netanyahu's comments, Marwan Kanafani, a spokesman for Arafat, told Reuters: &quot;Netanyahu is saying that all the time. I'm not going to take him seriously this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, Palestinians turned down a U.S. compromise date for Israeli troop withdrawals in the West Bank, insisting Washington make Israel respect the original timetable under which the three pullbacks should be completed by September.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has proposed to end the last stage of further redeployments from the rest of the West Bank in 1999. We rejected that,&quot; said Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, general secretary of the Palestinian presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;So to break the deadlock in the talks Ross proposed as a compromise mid-1998, and we rejected this as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>National Police Chief Assaf Hefetz said the Tel Aviv bombs blew up 10 minutes and several metres (yards) apart. One Arab suspect was arrested, police said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Ichilov hospital said 10 people were hurt, none seriously. An ambulance service said three other people who were slightly wounded were taken to another hospital.</p>
<p>Palestinian militants last mounted a bombing campaign in Israel in February and March last year when suicide bombers killed 59 people.</p>
