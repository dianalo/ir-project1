<headline>US budget talks on domestic spending end for day.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Congressional leaders and White House officials said they discussed domestic spending issues at a meeting Wednesday, and said it was going to be a difficult area in which to reach agreement.</p>
<p>But they said they were going to continue to work on it.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a very thorough discussion but as far as coming up with any conclusions I believe that that will have to wait for another day on appropriations,&quot; Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici said.  </p>
<p>&quot;In these kind of processes if we look a little bit down it's just because the processes are very difficult and in my opinion it's sort of the darkness before the dawn comes,&quot; the New Mexico Republican said.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot say a lot was accomplished today, but it's fair to say we have a general understanding and we're prepared to roll up our sleeves and do some more work on this overall area,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>White House Budget Director Franklin Raines described Wednesday's talks as &quot;very good frank discussion about one of the toughest areas that we are going to have to tackle.&quot;  </p>
<p>House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, an Ohio Republican, said any final agreement on domestic spending would unlikely please any side.</p>
<p>&quot;If we reach an agreement at the end of the day, no one is going to be happy with what we do in discretionary spending, that's fair to say,&quot; he said. &quot;The administration's not going to be happy, we're not going to be happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans are seeking deeper domestic spending cuts from the White House, said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and the ranking Democrat on the budget committee.</p>
<p>Thursday's budget meeting will focus on tax cut proposals.</p>
