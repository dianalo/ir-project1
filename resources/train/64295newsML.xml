<p>Egyptian share prices rose on Thursday in a bullish market which might soon be due for a short-term correction, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) overall index rose a fraction to 233.91 from 233.90 but the higher prices for the most active stocks belied this impression of stagnation.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded companies closed 2.58 points up at 358.87, its highest level since January 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost everything went up. We may see a correction soon -- a healthy one, with nothing to worry about,&quot; said broker Neveen El Tahry of Delta EAB Stockbrokers.</p>
<p>In the absence of new privatised shares for the last few days, investors have been looking again at the old favourites, such as milling and cement companies, she added.</p>
<p>The imminent launch of a GDR in Suez Cement is also having an effect, because investors think that other big companies might follow the same path. &quot;More GDRs will be talked about. That's improving the cement sector,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>State-owned National Bank of Egypt is announcing details of the Suez Cement GDR on Monday morning. Salomon Brothers are coordinating the launch, the second for any Egyptian stock.</p>
<p>Suez Cement ended 0.10 pounds up at 52.50, National Cement rose 1.25 to 20.00 and Amreya Cement was 1.45 higher at 62.00. Helwan Cement was unchanged and Egyptian Tora Portland Cement fell 0.86 to 63.45.</p>
<p>In the milling sector North Cairo Flour Mills, the most active stock of all, rose 2.00 to 108.00 but Southern Cairo Flour Mills fell back 0.76 to 55.50.</p>
<p>Advances outnumbered declines by 23 to 18. The CMA index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms fell to 159.91 points from 160.29.</p>
