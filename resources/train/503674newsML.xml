<p>Bank of Beirut shares galvanised the Beirut Stock Exchange on their opening day on Friday, trading at 38 percent above issue price amid massive investor demand.</p>
<p>The shares, the third bank stock to hit the market, opened at $3 compared with the $2.17 issue price. Demand was nearly 6.5 million shares against supply of 475,000 and just under 321,000 changed hands.</p>
<p>The LIBX bank index rose 0.29 percent to 123.25, the BLOM stock index rose 0.01 percent to 908.61 and the LISPI index rose 0.08 percent to 84.94.</p>
<p>Dealers said BoB's spectacular debut underlined growing local and regional investor interest in Beirut's re-emerging stock exchange, particularly in bank stocks.</p>
<p>The Beirut Stock Exchange has become increasingly liquid in the wake of a recent sharp decline in interest rates on Lebanese t-bills which had absorbed liquidity on the Beirut financial markets for the past few years.</p>
<p>The two other banks traded -- Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce and Banque Audi -- have risen 30 percent since listing in December and January but local financiers and stockbrokers were divided on Friday on how Bank of Beirut would perform.</p>
<p>&quot;Why shouldn't BoB be able to continue rising? There is strong demand and I am very confident in the bank and its comeback since 1993 has been flawless,&quot; Alain Balian, a deputy manager at Beirut finance house Lebanon Invest, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a positive sign that will encourage more listings and boost activity. As there is not much choice in the Lebanese equities market at the moment the bulk of the capital will remain in bank shares,&quot; Balian of Lebanon Invest said.</p>
<p>However, a broker who asked not to be identified said he considered the price a very bad start.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not logical,&quot; he said. &quot;A 38 percent rise in one day is too much and the share is way overvalued. Many people will have to forget about Bank of Beirut and turn to the other bank shares.&quot;</p>
<p>Nabil Aoun, a member of the Stock Exchange Committee and chairman of Fidus finance house, said uneven allocation of BoB's massively oversubscribed $10.4 million private share placement last month was the reason for the huge demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The big demand for Bank of Beirut shares is because of bad allocation of the share placement. They have created speculation because when you give some people two percent and others 20 percent you create speculation,&quot; Aoun told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, Ziad Makawi of Middle East Capital Group which managed the placement said discretionary allocation was normal in private placements.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact of the matter is that what moved the market to go up is the level of oversubscription in the private placement,&quot; he said. &quot;We are obviously very pleased.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It says a lot about the appetite for Lebanese bank shares locally and in the region,&quot; Makkawi added.</p>
<p>Total market turnover jumped to 465,991 from 109,831 and value was $2,030,661 from $1,047,981 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce rose to $14.5 from $14.375. It has risen 29 percent since trading began at $11.25 on December 30. Banque Audi was steady at $19.5, 30 percent above its January 20 debut at $15. Solidere A and B were unchanged at $10.25 and $10.75. Turnover fell to 34,796 shares from 49,943.</p>
<p>Ciments Libanais traded in a block of 60,000 shares on the floor at Thursday's closing of $1.25.</p>
<p>Eternit held steady at $2.00 amid strong demand and turnover of 18,300 shares from 24,350.</p>
<p>There was no trade in the other two listed companies, tilemaker Uniceramic and Ciments Blancs.</p>
