<p>Wackenhut Corp is in talks to buy two Florida-based employee leasing companies with combined 1996 revenue of about $60 million, Wackenhut president and chief operating officer, Richard Wackenhut, said.</p>
<p>Wackenhut, in an interview with Reuters, declined to identify the two, privately owned companies. He said Wackenhut -- a professional human resources management company best known for security services -- was currently in due diligence with one of the Florida companies and talks with the other company were still in the &quot;embryonic stages.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said Wackenhut could announce one of the acquisitions by May.</p>
<p>The company would pay for the acquisitions with cash and stock and also with new debt, Wackenhut said, adding that it would use its non-voting, Class B stock in any potential deals. The company now has about $6 million in debt, he said.</p>
<p>The acquisitions would contribute about 3,000 -- or some two-thirds -- the 5,000 employees Wackenhut expects to add to its fledgling employee leasing business in 1997.  </p>
<p>The company launched the business a month ago and has about 700 employees under contract. It leases the employees to other companies, which enables those companies to cut payroll, administration and other expenses, Richard Wackenhut said.</p>
<p>Wackenhut also said the company -- started by his father in the mid 1950s -- should grow its revenue by $100 million for 1997, bringing total revenue past the $1 billion mark.</p>
<p>He made no earnings projections for the year, saying only that the company expects to grow its net by 20 percent.  </p>
<p>He said the company's 55 percent-owned company, Wackenhut Corrections expects to boost its revenue to $200 million for 1997 from about $140 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Wackenhut also said acquisitions for the year might come from the company's food services operations, although declined to be more specific. The company plans to spinoff the operations -- which constitute about eight percent of total Wackenhut revenue -- possibly in 1998, he said.</p>
<p>Wackenhut's stock closed Wednesday at 17-1/4, up 1/4.</p>
<p>The company announced earlier Wednesday that it earned $0.22 per share for its fourth quarter, compared with $0.16 for the year-ago period.</p>
<p>For the year it said it earned $0.66 per share, compared with $0.60 in 1995.</p>
