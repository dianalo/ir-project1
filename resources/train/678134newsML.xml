<p>After two years of studying pollution flows across the eastern half of the United States, 32 states Thursday agreed that they all needed to take steps to help combat smog in cities with the dirtiest air.</p>
<p>The agreement clears the way for the Environmental Protection Agency to tell states that they not only have to curb emissions to clean their own air but also to assist neighboring states.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem that we've been facing here and for the first time have really come up with a way to address is the fact that individual states really don't have the ability to control most of the sources of pollution that are affecting their air quality,&quot; said EPA Assistant Administrator Mary Nichols.</p>
<p>As a result, the agency could force Ohio and West Virginia, for example, to trim their smog-forming emissions to help Pittsburgh in nearby Pennsylvania meet federal ozone limits.</p>
<p>Nichols said based on the recommendations overwhelmingly approved by the Ozone Transport Assessment Group, which included 37 states and the District of Columbia, EPA this September will ask states to lay out their plans to curb smog. States will then have one year to respond.</p>
<p>The ozone group, assembled by EPA two years ago, found that in general pollution traveled longer distances, sometimes as much as 500 miles, in the northern half of the 37 states than in the south, where emissions drifted about 150 miles.</p>
<p>After looking at pollution from power plants, cars, and industrial sources, the group found that the cheapest way to curb smog-forming emissions was to target power plants.</p>
<p>The most significant recommendation called for power plants to be required to cut their emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 50 to 85 percent from projected levels for 2007.</p>
<p>To ensure that utilities did not bear an unfair burden, the ozone group called for other large industrial plants to curb their emissions of nitrogen oxides by 55 to 70 percent.</p>
<p>The group also encouraged more areas to use cleaner, reformulated gasoline, which is already required in cities with the dirtiest air, asked EPA to consider stricter standards for diesel fuel, and encouraged car companies to build new low emission vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're talking about is controls on power plants and other sources which will ultimately cost millions of dollars but will also achieve benefits for close to 50 million people who breath air that isn't currently healthy,&quot; Nichols said in an interview after the ozone group's final meeting.</p>
<p>She said the recommendations should help all states meet current ozone standards as well as stricter standards that EPA is proposing for after 2000.</p>
<p>Five states -- Virginia, West Virginia, Michigan, Alabama, and Kentucky -- opposed the final report, but said they might change their votes after reviewing it.</p>
<p>Northeastern states and green groups, which have long argued that pollution from the Midwest was aggravating ozone problems in the Northeast, hailed the outcome of the two-year project.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be tragic if EPA did not rapidly follow this up by imposing very stringent pollution controls throughout the (ozone group) region,&quot; said David Wooley, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Energy Group.</p>
<p>Ohio's EPA director Don Schregardus said that his state would be working with Indiana and Kentucky to study their smob effects on Cincinnati, while at the same time Ohio would have to consider curbing its emissions to help Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>He was more skeptical about Ohio's impact on cities like New York and Boston. &quot;Right now, we certainly believe we have a much smaller impact in cities such as New York and Boston, because those are hundreds of miles from Ohio's borders,&quot; he said.</p>
