<title>RUSSIA: Russian Avtovaz plans share issue to cover debts.</title>
<headline>Russian Avtovaz plans share issue to cover debts.</headline>

<p>Giant Russian carmaker Avtovaz, in a deal aimed at preventing threatened bankruptcy proceedings, will double its share capital and offer new shares to a single investor or to portfolio investors, a minister said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin told a news conference after talks with officials from Avtovaz, the Russian bankruptcy commission and the Samara region, where the plant is located, that the new approach would allow Avtovaz to avoid bankruptcy proceedings for non-payment of tax debts.  </p>
<p>&quot;In two months AvtoVAZ will ask shareholders to authorise the issue of extra shares equal to existing capital which will be sold in one of two ways -- offered in full to a strategic investor or an institute of financial consultants will be set up and shares will be sold to portfolio investors,&quot; Potanin said.</p>
<p>He named Germany's General Motors unit Opel AG, BMW AG and Ford Motor Co as companies which could be approached as possible investors.</p>
<p>Potanin, a former banker whose predecessor has returned to head Avtovaz after a brief stint as first deputy prime minister in charge of Russian economic reforms, said revenues from sale of the new shares would be used to cover some AvtoVAZ debts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars rather than tens of millions,&quot; he said, adding that the issue of the shares would probably take place in three or four months.</p>
<p>The share issue will not cover all AvtoVAZ's debts and the rest will be restructured by the government, Potanin said.</p>
<p>AvtoVAZ, which makes the Lada car, is Russia's eighth biggest company by sales, and with a workforce of 114,000, its fifth biggest employer.</p>
<p>But government officials, desperate to rake in tax revenue to win new tranches of a multi-billion dollar IMF loan, have suggested starting bankruptcy proceedings against the company to force it to pay its tax debts.</p>
<p>The chairman of the State Property Committee, Russia's privatisation ministry, said last week that AvtoVAZ could choose between the official bankruptcy procedure and repaying its debts doubling its capital through a new share issue.</p>
<p>He put AvtoVAZ debt at about 11 trillion roubles ($2 billion).</p>
