<title>USA: CBOE launches new trading floor for NYSE options.</title>
<headline>CBOE launches new trading floor for NYSE options.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange inaugurated a new 2,500 square foot trading floor on Monday to house the New York Stock Exchange's former options business.</p>
<p>The NYSE agreed last October to sell its options business to the CBOE.</p>
<p>The New York exchange had listed options on 258 equities and the NYSE composite index  .NYA. Of the options, 164 were uniquely listed and now trade in the CBOE's new trading facility, dubbed the Green Room. The others were multiply listed and were already available at the CBOE.  </p>
<p>The CBOE said it had issued 75 special trading permits, valid for seven years, to allow trading of the new products in the Green Room. Of these, 51 were issued to traders and firms that relocated. The rest were leased to other traders.</p>
<p>Fewer than 100 people transferred to Chicago from New York, including about 50 traders, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our firm saw an opportunity here when several options exchanges looked to take over the New York business, and it was clear to us and to our firm that this was the right place to be,&quot; Kieran Duffy, senior principal at Cohen, Duffy, McGowan &amp; Co LLC, told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Duffy's firm was one of seven new designated primary market makers at the CBOE.</p>
<p>William Brodsky, chairman and chief executive officer of the CBOE, said he hoped that over the seven-year life of the special permits, the traders from New York would become fully integrated with the CBOE and would lease or purchase seats on the exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;And seven years from now we'll have to sit down and decide whether the facilities should be merged once the trading rights expire,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The last membership at the CBOE sold on March 31 for a record $635,000.</p>
<p>Monday's inauguration caps a process that began last year. In early October, the NYSE's board of directors recommended the exchange negotiate a sale of its options business with the CBOE. The CBOE eventually paid $5 million for the business.</p>
<p>William Johnston, NYSE president and chief operating officer, said the New York exchange had entered the equity options business with &quot;too little too late. The NYSE began trading equity options on September 23, 1983.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this (move) gives our players a chance to get in, if you will, the major leagues,&quot; Johnston said.</p>
