<p>Residents of Zaire's third city Kisangani said on Thursday they wanted rebels who captured the city to continue their military advance and topple President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>The residents said they wanted rebel leader Laurent Kabila to reject calls for a ceasefire from the United Nations and Organisation of African Unity.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody in this town is unanimous in the view that we should continue this war to get rid of the dictator (Mobutu),&quot; said Maurice Bumba, chief of the rural development office in Kisangani's Makiso zone.</p>
<p>&quot;We have negotiated a million times before with the powers that be but the result was never respected,&quot; Bumba said.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) walked into Kisangani on March 15 after a motley crew of government troops and mercenaries fled.</p>
<p>An alliance delegation held direct talks with government representatives on Wednesday at a special Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in the Togolese capital Lome.</p>
<p>The United Nations, OAU and the U.S. government are urging the rebels to declare a ceasefire after five months of fighting in which they have seized control of around one-quarter of the massive country.</p>
<p>But the clear popularity of the alliance in territory it controls undermines the credibility of calls for a ceasefire, one western diplomat said.</p>
<p>Rebels say there can be no ceasefire before negotiations in the form of a summit between Mobutu and Kabila, but they are willing to start talks between rival delegations to prepare the summit.</p>
<p>Privately senior alliance officials dismiss the Lome summit and say they favour a South African peace initiative, not least because President Nelson Mandela publically shook hands with Kabila in February, the first head of state to do so.</p>
<p>Boosted by their popularity in Kisangani and the collapse of the government army in the face of their advance the rebels have little time for ceasefire calls.</p>
<p>&quot;Very soon we will make an announcement on the military front that will sink Lome,&quot; an aide to Kabila said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Six thousand Kisangani men have joined the Alliance army since the city's fall, according to rebel Voice of the People radio.</p>
<p>At Makiso, one of six zones, 497 men over the age of 15 have signed up and started training since recruitment began last week, according to officials of the ousted city government now under the rebels.</p>
<p>Columns of new recruits still unarmed and in civilian clothes run through the city singing each morning.</p>
<p>&quot;I decided to let my son enter the army because I want the entire country to be liberated. I know my son might die but without sacrifices there cannot be liberty,&quot; said man.</p>
<p>Residents said they measured their liberation and support for the rebels primarily in terms of freedom from harrassment by the government army and mercenaries.</p>
