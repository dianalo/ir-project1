<p>In contrast to U.S. scepticism, Germany was upbeat on Friday that NATO could strike a deal with Russia on the alliance's eastward expansion in time for a planned May 27 summit in Paris.</p>
<p>Karlheinz Hornhues, chairman of the Bonn parliament's foreign affairs committee, said Thursday's meeting between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Boris Yeltsin showed Russia no longer saw NATO's plans as a challenge to Moscow.</p>
<p>His positive outlook, echoing Kohl's assessment the day before, contrasted with the reserve U.S. officials showed about Yeltsin's statement that disagreements about stationing NATO troops in former Warsaw Pact states could be worked out soon.</p>
<p>NATO rejects Moscow's demand for a treaty barring foreign troops and atomic weapons from the territory of new members like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which are expected to be invited to join the alliance this summer.</p>
<p>Hornhues, a leading foreign policy expert in Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said Yeltsin had committed himself to finding a solution in time.</p>
<p>&quot;If one side says 'we'll get there on time,' then it is putting itself under pressure,&quot; he told German radio.</p>
<p>&quot;When you set a deadline, it applies to yourself as well as to your partner. So I think this announcement that they'll make it by then gives reason for optimism.&quot;</p>
<p>Hornhues agreed with Yeltsin's comment that much work remained to be done and added: &quot;The Russian side's optimism is a very important point because it contributes a certain balance Russia wants, i.e. that the issue of the planned NATO expansion must not be seen as a development aimed against Russia.&quot;</p>
<p>But he stood firmly against Moscow's treaty demand, saying NATO could not sign a legal document that limited its new members' sovereignty. &quot;This is not acceptable for us because it would make the new members second-class members,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kohl did not address this directly but hinted Bonn was not ready to break ranks with NATO, which also rejects the treaty demand and wants to sign a less binding charter with Moscow.</p>
<p>The chancellor pledged to do his best to help reach an agreement but added pointedly: &quot;We do not have the role of an interpreter.&quot;</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) made clear on Thursday they also had no interest in making the crucial concession demanded by Moscow.</p>
<p>SPD foreign policy expert Guenter Verheugen said Russia could not expect to pressure NATO into conceding the same security guarantees for eastern European members that it got from Bonn for former East German territory.</p>
<p>In the hectic negotiations leading to German unity in 1990, Bonn conceded to Moscow a ban on foreign troops or atomic weapons similar to that which Russia is demanding for any East European states entering NATO.</p>
<p>NATO has no plans to deploy foreign troops or atomic weapons in Eastern Europe but says it cannot seal this in a treaty.</p>
<p>Verheugen agreed: &quot;I don't think this can be settled in a treaty-like document. We have to tell the Russians very clearly that that would be a classic case of a treaty to the detriment of a third party, which I think is not possible.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Two Plus Four treaty, hammered out by the two Germanys with World War Two victors the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France, Bonn agreed only to allow German troops onto the territory of former East Germany.</p>
<p>Russia has recently upped the ante on the security issue, trying to rule out any improvement of military installations and limit upgrades in communications facilities of prospective new members such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
