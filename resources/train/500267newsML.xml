<p>Germany is a key trading partner of Iran, but even before tensions flared between the two countries on Thursday, the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) said high debts and political differences had begun to strain economic ties.</p>
<p>German companies exported some 2.2 billion marks ($1.3 billion) worth of goods to the Islamic state last year, while Germany imported 1.1 billion marks in goods from Iran.</p>
<p>Of total exports from Germany to Iran, around 31 percent was machinery, 19 percent electrical equipment, 11 percent chemicals. Other items included food and fine mechanical goods.</p>
<p>German imports from Iran included woolen textiles, 42.7 percent, pistachio nuts 17.3 percent, and crude oil, 23.4 percent.</p>
<p>German exports to Iran are down from around eight billion marks just five years ago, but despite increased political tension between the two countries there are still 169 German corporations with offices in Iran.</p>
<p>According to DIHT, exports to Iran have fallen sharply because of the country's huge foreign debt, which it said was around $22 billion at the end of 1996. Germany has provided Iran with some 5.2 billion marks in export credits.</p>
<p>The country's main export goods are oil, which account for some 82 percent of goods sold abroad. Iran has the world's fourth largest oil reserves and in 1995/96 produced some 3.6 million barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p>It has an inflation rate of 50 percent and 50 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>Iran had a trade surplus of $1 billion with the European Union in 1995, according to data provided by the Bonn Economics Ministry. The EU exported some $5.1 billion to Iran and imported $6.1 billion worth of goods.</p>
<p>Iran was ranked 42 among importers of German goods and 49 among exporters to Germany, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The German Foreign Ministry said around 500 German citizens currently live in Iran.</p>
