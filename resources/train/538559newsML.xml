<p>Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila said on Friday his forces were advancing towards the town of Kikwit, bringing the battle closer to the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>Kabila, head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), told Reuters his guerrilla army was closing in on Kikwit after seizing Ilebo, Tshikapa and Dowete and they could arrive in the town in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>On diplomatic moves, Kabila said he wanted face-to-face talks with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko in South Africa or possibly Zambia and rejected all other proposed venues on security grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to meet the man (Mobutu) in a place where security is 100 percent guaranteed,&quot; he said, adding South Africa or perhaps Zambia were his only preferences for talks on the president's departure from power.</p>
<p>He did not mention Gabon as a venue for the talks, saying he was still prepared to meet Mobutu for talks on his &quot;respectful departure from power&quot; but the question was where.</p>
<p>Mobutu's son and spokesman said earlier the president would have no objection to meeting rebel Kabila in Gabon for talks on ending Zaire's civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no official comment yet but it's no problem for the president,&quot; Nznaga Mobutu told Reuters when asked about his father's reaction to efforts to stage the talks in Gabon.</p>
<p>A regional military analyst who closely monitors the war between Kabila's rebels and the government army, said the rebels had stepped up their push on Kikwit, the town 390 km (240 miles) east of Kinshasa which shot into world limelight in 1995 because of an epidemic of the Ebola virus.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very close to Kikwit and our forces should be there in the next 48 hours,&quot; Kabila said.</p>
<p>&quot;After Kikwit, we will be very close to Kinshasa which is our final destination. We are moving fast and we are also consolidating an overwhelming force for the final battle of Kinshasa,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kabila, whose rebels have seized more than half of Africa's third largest nation, said the battle for Kinshasa would come &quot;sooner than expected and will be very, very swift&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The force will be big and the firepower overwhelming and necessary to contain the notorious army,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Zairean military official in Kinshasa said on Wednesday it was possible the rebels had taken Ilebo and Tshikapa but was not sure about the capture of Dowete, a major town in Mobutu's home province of Equateur.</p>
<p>Ilebo is Zaire's largest inland port and second most important after its only sea port at Matadi on the country's small Atlantic coastline. It is the most vital link for goods destined for Kinshasa, transported by train from Lubumbashi and even South Africa, then transhipped by river to the capital.</p>
<p>Kabila, was speaking in the country's second largest city Lubumbashi, which is the rebels' biggest prize so far.</p>
<p>He denied reports he was receiving help from neighbouring Angola's President Eduardo dos Santos, Zaire's arch-rival.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Dos Santos wants revenge because of Mobutu's longterm support for Angolan guerrilla groups such as UNITA against the ruling MPLA party in Angola.</p>
<p>&quot;People are refusing to accept the basic fact that this is a Zairean war, a Zairean revolution to cleanse the country of dictatorship, impunity and corruption,&quot; the rebel leader said.</p>
<p>Kabila has declined to go to Congo's capital and Mobutu has turned down on health grounds an invitation from South African President Nelson Mandela to travel to South Africa for talks.</p>
<p>Military analysts said with Kabila enjoying overwhelming military advantage on the ground he was in no hurry for the talks, which might benefit Mobutu and head off a battle for Kinshasa.</p>
