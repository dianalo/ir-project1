<title>ITALY: Italian police fire on colleagues, suspect killed.</title>
<headline>Italian police fire on colleagues, suspect killed.</headline>

<p>Police in Italy shot at colleagues by mistake, killing an arrested Mafia suspect in a gunfight that has prompted angry calls for better coordination.</p>
<p>Domenico Morabito, the son of a wanted crime boss, died of his wounds late on Saturday shortly after he was arrested by plainclothes Carabinieri paramilitary police in the small Calabrian mountain town of Africo on the toe of southern Italy.</p>
<p>Authorities on Monday said the officers had fired in the air to stop bystanders from intervening when they snatched Morabito, 39, from a street and bundled him into an unmarked car.</p>
<p>Civilian police nearby, alerted by the shots, spotted the speeding vehicle and opened fire when its driver ignored orders to stop, killing Morabito and slightly wounding a Carabiniere.</p>
<p>Both forces described the incident as a &quot;tragic mistake&quot;.</p>
<p>All the officers involved were in plainclothes. Newspapers on Monday said both groups may have believed the other was from the 'Ndrangheta, the Calabrian equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia.</p>
<p>Police unions called the shooting a scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;We can no longer tolerate police and Carabinieri shooting at each other without knowing who they are,&quot; said Roberto Sgalla, leader of the SIULP police union.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unthinkable that Carabinieri and police, especially when they're in plainclothes, work in the same places without knowing about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Carabinieri come under the jurisdiction of the Defence Ministry while civilian police answer to the Interior Ministry. Italy also has a finance police force as well as municipal police in each town.</p>
