<p>The Slovak SAX index eased 3.48 points to 190.73 in sluggish trading on Tuesday as uncertanity over the future of the crown continued to hold investors back from the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE).</p>
<p>Only 408 shares were matched on the main BSE listed floor on turnover of 340,778. Overall volume fell to 228,523 shares, with 211,720 stocks matched as direct trades, from 409,938 shares on Monday.</p>
<p>Overall turnover totalled 57.43 million crowns, down from 128.71 million on Monday.</p>
<p>Blue chips closed mixed, but dealers said all major shares traded insignificant volumes and failed to indicate any longer- term trend. Nor did they reflect their real market value.</p>
<p>The most-heavily capitalised issue, oil refiner Slovnaft, lost 25 crowns but traded only 73 stocks. Major steel maker VSZ gained 20 crowns with 222 shares matched.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were reluctant to place crown funds into the highly iliquid Slovak capital market since they appeared afraid of losing money on a possible weakening of the crown, which has been under heavy downward pressure in recent weeks.</p>
