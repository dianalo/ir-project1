<p>German call money rates climbed as high as 3.25 percent on Thursday as dealers stepped up preparations for month-end, which often results in significant price gyrations.</p>
<p>The bulk of trades was conducted between 3.10/15 percent after rates traded between 3.05/3.12 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rise in prices was expected and occurs every month, even though banks have had a slightly more difficult time meeting this month's target.</p>
<p>&quot;A further increase in prices can't be ruled out as banks still scramble to meet the reserve target,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they would prefer to try and meet obligations today, particularly as more funds are expected to leave the system further tightening liquidity.</p>
<p>Tighter-than-normal liquidity conditions, prompted by a higher than expected 40.0 billion mark monthly reserve target, already forced the Bundesbank to inject additional funds late last week.</p>
<p>In light of current conditions, dealers said borrowings at the 4.50 percent Lombard emergency borrowing rate would be high today. Lombard borrowings on Wednesday stood at 100 million marks after banks borrowed negligible amounts one day earlier.  </p>
<p>Banks held 43.7 billion marks in non-interest bearing accounts at the central bank on Wednesday, down from 46.6 billion marks on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the monthly average remained unchanged at 43.1 billion marks.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average  FIONA= was set at 3.22333 percent on Thursday after 3.12300 percent on Wednesday.</p>
