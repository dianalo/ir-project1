<p>Implied volatility of short sterling options traded on LIFFE pushed higher on Wednesday ahead of an expected increase in British interest rates on Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>A string of stronger-than-expected economic data, including a surprise jump in underlying inflation to 2.7 percent year-on- year, has persuaded most traders that a rate hike of a quarter-point is on the cards.</p>
<p>The Bank of England's policy committee continues it meeting on Thursday, and will make its decision known at midday. British base rates currently stand at 6.5 percent, after a a quarter-point rise in early June.</p>
<p>&quot;There's some talk that a half-point is possible, but a quarter is a racing certainty,&quot; said a broker at a British brokerage. &quot;Put buying has been the order of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Implied volatility of September short sterling options rose to 8.2 percent mid, compared with 8.05 percent on Tuesday. December was up to 9.0 percent mid compared with 8.90 percent previously. March 1998 was up to 10.5 percent, from 10.25 percent, and June was steady at 12.6 percent.</p>
<p>By 1410 GMT, December short sterling futures stood one basis point down at 92.57. September also lost 0.01 to 92.79.</p>
<p>About 2,000 September puts were traded at the 92.50 strike, and almost 5,000 at the 92.75 strike, traders said.</p>
<p>In December the 92.25 and 92.50 strikes were most active.</p>
<p>Put spreads in September and December were also popular, according to a trader at a British bank, who noted a one-by-two put spread at 92.50/92.75 in September and a one-by-one at 92.50/92.25 in December.</p>
