<p>Share prices finished lower on Wednesday at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) as an anticipated statement on tax proposals failed to emerge before trading ended, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 30-share BSE index fell 50.75 points, or 1.48 percent, to a provisional 3,384.08 at close.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange (NSE) dropped 10.13 points, or 1.01 percent, to a provisional 990.87.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was expecting some announcement but was disappointed,&quot; one trader said, referring to Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's expected statement on the budget proposals.</p>
<p>Chidambaram defended a controversial minimum alternate tax (MAT) in parliament after markets closed for the day.</p>
<p>&quot;MAT is a justified levy. It will not be more than 12.9 percent,&quot; he said while introducing for voting the finance bill for fiscal 1996/97 (April-March).</p>
<p>Traders had been expecting the government to dilute the tax for some sectors like steel and cement.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will seek lower levels if some incentives are not forthcoming,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>He said foreign and state-run domestic funds were net sellers during the day.</p>
<p>The 500-share CISIL index dropped 9.43 points, or 1.39 percent, to a provisional 668.97.</p>
<p>Reports that demand was slowing hit automobiles shares. TELCO fell 10.50 rupees to 465.25 and Bajaj Auto 28.75 to 986.25.</p>
<p>Selling by foreign funds dragged Gujarat Ambuja Cement down 12.50 to 287.50. ACC dropped 21.50 rupees to 2,025.</p>
<p>SBI shed 7.75 rupees to 268.75 on foreign selling. BSES lost 9.0 rupees to 187, ITC 7.25 to 288.50, Reliance 4.75 to 202.25, TISCO 3.50 to 183.75 and L&amp;T 3.0 to 245.</p>
