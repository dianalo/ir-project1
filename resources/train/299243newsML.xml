<headline>U.S. hails &quot;courageous&quot; Georgian move on diplomat.</headline>

<p>The United States hailed as courageous Friday's announcement by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze that he was prepared to lift the immunity of a Georgian diplomat involved in a fatal car crash in Washington.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials said that Shevardnadze's statement did not amount to lifting the diplomat's immunity and Georgia would have to decide whether to do so if U.S. authorities brought charges against Gueorgui Makharadze, 35.</p>
<p>A statement issued in Tbilisi said: &quot;The president of Georgia is prepared to waive the diplomatic immunity of Gueorgui Makharadze. Makharadze shall remain in the United States of America until the completion of the investigation and legal procedures unless a different agreement between the two governments is reached.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Department said Shevardnadze called in the U.S. charge d'affaires in Tbilisi, Lawrence Kerr, on Friday to deliver the same message, which followed an appeal by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to waive Makharadze's immunity.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States very much welcomes this step by chairman Shevardnadze,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a courageous step. It's highly unusual in modern diplomacy to see a head of state take such a responsible and courageous position,&quot; Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said on Wednesday it believed it had sufficient evidence to prosecute Makharadze over last Friday's five-car smash which killed Joviane Waltrick, a 16-year-old Brazilian girl living in Kensington, Maryland.</p>
<p>It has not yet brought formal charges. But if diplomatic immunity is waived, prosecutors in the attorney's office plan to move fast and present evidence to a grand jury for a possible indictment, federal law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>They said action could occur within a week and possible charges included negligent homicide, second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter, depending on the evidence.</p>
<p>Christopher made his appeal to Shevardnadze after the Georgian government told the U.S. embassy in Tbilisi Thursday that it planned to recall Makharadze. U.S. officials said they had &quot;strong indications&quot; Thursday that the diplomat was about to leave the United States, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>The Georgian leader has close ties to the United States dating from his long spell as foreign minister of the former Soviet Union in the 1980s.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official noted that Shevardnadze's statement fell short of a cast-iron guarantee that Makharadze's immunity would be lifted if charges were pressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Has his diplomatic immunity actually been waived? Not yet...but we hope it will be lifted,&quot; the official said. He said Washington had no idea what was meant by the reference to &quot;a different agreement between the two governments&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our firm view is that there shouldn't be any deal here, that his immunity should be lifted and he should be tried if in fact charges are brought against him by the U.S. attorney,&quot; said the official, speaking anonymously.</p>
<p>The official said Shevardnadze's announcement was &quot;obviously an attempt by the Georgian government to leave themselves some options&quot;.</p>
<p>Referring to the apparently conflicting Georgian statements, he added: &quot;The Georgian government is badly divided on this. I think what you have here is the president of Georgia stepping forward and doing the right thing.&quot;</p>
