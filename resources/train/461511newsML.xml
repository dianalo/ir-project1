<p>Three policemen were killed and two seriously injured when their armoured personnel carrier was hit by an explosion in the southern Russian republic of North Ossetia, Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The agency, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, quoted North Ossetian Interior Ministry officials as saying the blast occurred on Friday near the border with another Russian republic, Ingushetia.</p>
<p>The blast was believed to have been caused by an anti-tank mine, the officials said.</p>
<p>Interfax said the policemen had been on their way to help another police vehicle which had hit a mine in the area. There were no casualties in the earlier incident.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately available.</p>
