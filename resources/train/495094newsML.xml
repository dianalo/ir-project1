<title>GERMANY: German March jobless falls to 4.30 million.</title>
<headline>German March jobless falls to 4.30 million.</headline>
<dateline>NUREMBERG, Germany 1997-04-08</dateline>

<p>German unemployment slipped by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.30 million in March but there was little sign that the economy was creating new jobs, the Federal Labour Office said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate, which is based on unadjusted data, fell to 11.7 percent, compared with 12.2 percent in February.</p>
<p>Unadjusted unemployment -- the most politically sensitive jobs figure in Germany -- fell to 4.48 million from February's 4.67 million, the highest since 1933.</p>
<p>The unadjusted figure has a direct impact on Germany's ability to rein in its deficit this year to qualify for European monetary union.</p>
<p>Despite the month-on-month fall, unadjusted unemployment was still around 340,000 higher than in March 1996.</p>
<p>The president of the Labour Office, Bernhard Jagoda, said the March decline was largely the result of seasonal factors.</p>
<p>&quot;There were many job losses in the early part of the year above all because of bad weather ... The exceptionally mild weather in March made rehiring workers in outdoor jobs easier,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he added that there were no indications yet that economic growth was giving a boost to job creation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he said it was still possible that Germany would record an average unadjusted unemployment level of 4.2 million for 1997. This figure underlies government forecasts that it will keep its budget deficit under 3 percent of gross domestic product, the limit set for qualification for EMU.</p>
<p>Independent analysts had expected a fall of between 15,000 and 25,000 in seasonally-adjusted unemployment after unadjusted figures were leaked on Monday.</p>
<p>In western Germany, the number of people out of work on a seasonally adjusted basis rose by 1,000 to 3.014 million in March from 3.013 million in February.</p>
<p>In eastern Germany, the adjusted number of unemployed fell by 16,000 to 1.284 million.</p>
