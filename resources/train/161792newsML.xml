<p>Bosnia's Federation parliament is expected next week to replace a defence official whose ouster the United States has demanded before it provides $100 million in military aid, government officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Washington wants Hasan Cengic, deputy defence minister, fired for his ties to Iran, which is accused by U.S. officials of sponsoring Islamic terrorism, and his alleged obstruction of Croat-Moslem cooperation needed to help reunify Bosnia.</p>
<p>The United States has held back a delivery of weapons meant to help the Moslem-Croat Federation reach military parity with the Serb entity in Bosnia until Cengic, a Moslem nationalist, and an unidentified second defence official are sacked.</p>
<p>&quot;Any decision on changes in the government will be reached at the Federation parliament session next week and I expect them to have in mind America's request in reaching such a decision,&quot; said government spokesman Mirza Hajric.</p>
<p>Bosnian officials have expressed resentment at the pressure for Cengic's removal since he played a key role in obtaining weapons from abroad to defend besieged Sarajevo during the war despite a U.N. arms embargo on the region.</p>
<p>Government sources have indicated Cengic would not be kicked out of the government in the end but only transferred to a senior post unconnected with the military.</p>
<p>&quot;If their (U.S.) aim is to publicly humiliate somebody then they will not be satisfied with our solution, but if they wanted someone removed from the defence ministry, this should do it,&quot; said a Bosnian official who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>In Washington, a U.S. official said Washington was also seeking the dismissal of a second defence official. The Bosnian official said he knew of no such request.</p>
<p>Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, told U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum on Friday that Sarajevo would meet U.S. demands next week.</p>
<p>&quot;A course of action has been set up where we feel pretty comfortable these issues can be resolved in the next couple of days,&quot; Sacirbey told reporters at the State Department.</p>
<p>The U.S. official said Sacirbey indicated the issue would resolved with the swearing-in by the Bosnian parliament of a successor to Cengic and another defence official.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the two men were considered too close to Moslem fundamentalist Iran and regarded as obstacles to building central government institutions for a reunified Bosnia in the wake of postwar elections.</p>
<p>The bulk of the military hardware, which includes tanks, artillery batteries and helicopters, arrived in late October by ship at the port of Ploce in neighbouring Croatia.</p>
<p>But the vessel has since moved offshore awaiting a resolution of the Cengic affair.</p>
<p>Washington went public with its pressure to dump Cengic after more discreet diplomatic efforts appeared to go nowhere.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Friday he withheld Cengic's name for a week after the Bosnian government promised to sack Cengic, but decided to go on the record when it was clear Sarajevo would take no action otherwise.</p>
<p>Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic was told of U.S. concerns more than a week ago, Burns said.</p>
<p>But Bosnia's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday the U.S. demand was astonishing after President Bill Clinton certified in August that Sarajevo had met all conditions for the military &quot;Equip-and-Train&quot; programme to go ahead.</p>
