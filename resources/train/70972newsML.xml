<p>Washington National Corp said the company is considering its strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of part or all of the company.</p>
<p>But, Washington National said the company is not involved in negotiations for the sale of the company, nor is a transaction pending.  </p>
<p>A Reuters report last week, citing people familiar with the situation, said the company was exploring a possible sale of the company.</p>
<p>The report said the company had hired Morgan Stanley as its investment banker and had opened its books to prospective buyers.</p>
<p>Washington National said the company has been in a formal process of evaluating its business alternatives for some time.</p>
<p>It said Morgan Stanley, the company's investment banker, has assisted the company in this process since it began in 1994 and said the process has resulted most recently in the sale of the company's health insurance business.</p>
<p>&quot;The company intends to continue to consider its strategic options, including growing its ongoing businesses or considering a sale for part or all of the company,&quot; Washington National chief executive Bob Patin said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is not involved in negotiations for the sale of the company nor is a transaction pending,&quot; he said.</p>
