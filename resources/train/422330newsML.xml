<p>Steady food prices slowed the Philippines' year-year inflation in February to 4.4 percent compared with 5.0 percent in January, the National Statistics Office said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The figure was sharply down from 11.8 percent in February, 1996 and it was the lowest inflation level achieved since July 1987, the government said.</p>
<p>On a month-on-month basis, inflation slackened to 0.4 percent in February versus 0.6 percent in the previous month.</p>
<p>Food prices, which comprise 58.47 percent of the consumer price index, posted zero monthly growth.</p>
<p>Analysts said the latest inflation figure was lower-than-expected.</p>
<p>Last week, a Reuter poll of six stock brokers and bankers had predicted February inflation at 4.94 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too good to be true. But it shows the economy is structurally in good shape to weather pressures on the price side,&quot; said Manny Lim, economist at ING Bank.</p>
<p>Lim was referring to cost-push factors such as the increases in wages and oil prices on February 8 when the petroleum industry was freed from government control.</p>
<p>In February, the minimum daily wage in the capital region was raised by 15 pesos to 180 pesos.</p>
<p>While oil refiners increased prices on premium gasoline, bunker fuel was reduced which limited the overall oil products price rise.</p>
<p>Economists said prices had remained almost steady because of the stiffer competition in a more open economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers are not raising their prices because of competition for as long as the economic profit is positive,&quot; said Theresa Aclan, an economist of Bankers Association of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Paul Joseph Garcia, an economist at Metrobank, said following the lower February inflation figure he was revising his full-year inflation forecast to 6.2 from 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>The benchmark 91-day T-bill rate could average at 10.0 to 10.5 percent for the year from 12.4 percent last year, he said.</p>
<p>The 91-day rate currently stands at 10.564 percent.</p>
<p>Ernesto Pernia, an economist at the Asian Development Bank, said he was not yet going to revise his forecast since the data on inflation was only based on two months. He projected inflation for the year at seven to eight percent.</p>
<p>The government is aiming for a six to seven percent inflation goal this year compared with 8.4 percent last year.</p>
<p>Analysts said inflation is expected to remain steady in the coming months since crude prices in the world market are expected to soften with the end of the winter season.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be smooth sailing in the next few months,&quot; Aclan said. But an immediate threat could come from a possible rise in U.S. interest rates which could weaken the peso and put upward pressure on domestic interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>The government reported that year-on-year inflation in Metro Manila was higher at 6.6 percent in February compared with 6.1 percent in January due to a 15.1 percent growth in the fuel, light and water component, and 7.8 percent growth in housing and repairs which include rentals.</p>
<p>In areas outside Metro Manila, year-on-year inflation was 3.6 percent in February compared with 4.6 percent in January as food prices tapered to a growth of 0.4 percent.</p>
