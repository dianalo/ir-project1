<title>TAIWAN: France to indefinitely freeze arms sales to Taiwan.</title>
<headline>France to indefinitely freeze arms sales to Taiwan.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-02-12</dateline>

<p>France has indefinitely halted further arms sales to Taiwan in a likely effort to appease China, state radio and newspapers reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Planned deals that have not been signed or are still under negotiation, such as the talks on supplying shoulder-launched Mistral missiles, would be stopped, the reports said.</p>
<p>The Independence Morning Post, quoting unidentified senior military officials, said France began the freeze at the end of January and had officially notified Taiwan earlier this month.</p>
<p>The freeze would not affect deals already signed between Taiwan and France, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has negotiated with France for the purchase of new weapons, including Matra Space and Defence Mistral missiles, anti-tank rockets, armoured cars and radar system.</p>
<p>Taiwan's China Times Express newspaper said France's move was aimed at appeasing China, Taiwan's arch rival, before President Jacques Chirac visits Beijing in May.</p>
<p>But the newspaper quoted an unidentified Defence Ministry official from Taiwan as saying that weapon sales from France to Taiwan would continue as long as they were not revealed.</p>
<p>Ministry spokesman Kung Fan-ting, speaking on state radio, said: &quot;It is our principle not to comment on arms deals&quot;.</p>
<p>Taiwan has bought six French Lafayette-class frigates, two of which have already been sent to the island. It has also signed a contract for 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets, a deal that drew China's anger.</p>
<p>Beijing retaliated by closing the French consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou and freezing French firms out of lucrative Chinese contracts.</p>
<p>China lifted the freeze in 1994 after Paris agreed that the &quot;one China&quot; term of its diplomatic relations with Beijing obliged it to abandon a policy of arming Taiwan, the last bastion of the exiled Republic of China government.</p>
<p>Taiwan and China split after their civil war ended in 1949. Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and has said any move by Taipei to declare independence would lead to an attack.</p>
