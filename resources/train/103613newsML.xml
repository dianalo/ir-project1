<p>Accidents at sea caused by sub- standard navigational or safety equipment should become rarer in European Union waters, following Euro-MPs' expected approval on October 23 of new marine safety rules.</p>
<p>The European Parliament is expected to give its resounding support to a draft directive which requires all vessels entering EU ports to respect the same high safety standards for radiocommunications equipment, lifeboats and life jackets, fire extinguishers and other pieces of equipment - COM(95)269.</p>
<p>&quot;This will make a significant difference to marine safety,&quot; Marie Elena Efthymiou, an official with the parliament's transport committee, told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Human error is the main cause of accidents at sea in ninety percent of cases but good quality equipment can help limit the damaging effect of such mistakes, Efthymiou said.</p>
<p>EU transport ministers provisionally cleared this first piece of EU law on the safety and efficacity of marine equipment on July 17. It needs parliament's approval to become law.</p>
<p>The new rules oblige the member states to check that all vessels entering their ports carry certificates which guarantee that their equipment meets minimum standards.</p>
<p>There may be further checks if the authorities doubt the vessel's condition.</p>
<p>&quot;Some flags are not trustworthy so their ships may also be checked physically,&quot; Efthymiou explained.</p>
<p>The transport committee is so concerned by this issue that it intends to urge the EU to include in all cooperation agreements with developing countries a requirement that they respect navigational safety standards.</p>
<p>Italian Independent Euro-MP Alessandro Danesin expects to finalise a report on the subject in December, on the basis of a public hearing in the parliament on October 29.</p>
<p>The directive on equipment safety leaves it to the member states to decide how often they should carry out checks but this should not lead to controls which are either excessive, and a potential barrier to trade, or else too lax to guarantee ship safety, Efthymiou said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not very likely that any port which earns a living from incoming ships will want to create barriers. On the other hand, the (EU's) port state control directive makes it the responsibility of member states to ensure boats leaving their ports do not fall to pieces,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>While generally very satisfied with the text approved by ministers, the transport committee's rapporteur, Nikitas Kaklamanis, will be urging Euro-MPs to make three changes on October 23.</p>
<p>The Greek Christian Democrat believes the directive should insist that all vessel safety inspectors be entirely independent of the equipment manufacturers and suppliers.</p>
<p>In addition, Kaklamanis will call for the text to be reworded to make explicitly clear that its provisions cover radiocommunications equipment, which is also the subject of a separate EU directive.</p>
<p>Finally, he will recommend giving the European Commission the power to administer the directive, helped by member states representatives playing a purely advisory role.  REUTER</p>
