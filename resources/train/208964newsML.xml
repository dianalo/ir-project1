<headline>SOCCER-SPANISH LEAGUE MATCHES THIS WEEKEND.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-11-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following matches are being played in the Spanish first division this weekend (league positions in paretheses, all kickoff times GMT)</p>
<p>Saturday:</p>
<p>Extremadura (21) vs Sporting Gijon (17)</p>
<p>1700</p>
<p>Only a win at fellow strugglers Extremadura will be enough for beleaguered Sporting coach Benito Floro, who will have to replace injured defender Pablo Diaz.</p>
<p>Athletic Bilbao (6) vs Barcelona (1)</p>
<p>1930</p>
<p>Luis Fernandez has started to make things happen for fallen giants Athletic, but Barcelona tend to do well in the San Mames ground and are looking like championship material.</p>
<p>Sunday:</p>
<p>Celta Vigo (12) vs Sevilla (16)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Celta have only won one home game this season, while Sevilla have won their last two away and have been reinforced by Bebeto ahead of their bid to avenge last year's 4-0 drubbing.</p>
<p>Deportivo Coruna (3) vs Logrones (19)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Deportivo crushed Logrones 5-0 the last time the sides met, and hope to have influential midfielder Fran Gonzalez back from injury against a side that hasn't scored in 11 hours of play.</p>
<p>Hercules (22) vs Compostela (18)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Quique Hernandez makes his home debut as Hercules manager in a vital relegation clash and hopes to have Serbian Pedrag Stankovic ready to play after signing from Red Star Belgrade.</p>
<p>Real Betis (4) vs Tenerife (10)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Betis tend to give up at home what they win away but have never lost in Seville to Tenerife, who will be without injured Bosnian striker Meho Kodro.</p>
<p>Rayo Vallecano (13) vs Zaragoza (20)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Rayo coach Paquito Garcia is expected to line up Dimitry Radchenko alongside goalscorer Guilherme against a Zaragoza side that have drawn their last two away games.</p>
<p>Oviedo (15) vs Real Sociedad (9)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>Real mifielder Francisco De Pedro is out injured, while Romanian goalscorer Gheorghe Craioveanu is also doubtful for a fixture that Real have won only twice in 23 meetings.</p>
<p>Espanyol (14) vs Racing Santander (8)</p>
<p>1600</p>
<p>After taking points from all but one of their away games this season, Racing will hope to improve on their record of 22 defeats in 28 visits to Espanyol's Sarria stadium.</p>
<p>Real Madrid (2) vs Valencia (11)</p>
<p>1830</p>
<p>'New manager, certain victory' says the motto, and Valencia, with just one point from four games, are hoping that Jorge Valdano won't be the exception to the rule against his old club.</p>
<p>Monday:</p>
<p>Valladolid (5) vs Atletico Madrid (7)</p>
<p>Atletico have won 1-0 on both their last visits to Valladolid, who have started well but are still smarting from Monday's 6-1 thrashing at Barcelona.</p>
