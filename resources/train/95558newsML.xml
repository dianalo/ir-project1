<p>Protesting its innocence, Iraq on Wednesday demanded that the United Nations implement its oil-for-food deal and stand up to Washington's alleged illegal and sustained campaign against Baghdad.</p>
<p>Iraq's foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, said in a speech to the General Assembly the United States had no justification for its recent missile attacks on Iraq and was singly responsible for delaying implementation of a plan for Iraq to sell oil in order to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>The United States launched cruise missiles against air defense facilities in southern Iraq last month in retaliation for an Iraqi move against Kurds in the north.</p>
<p>Sahaf was also more critical than usual of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of overseeing destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, a prime condition for lifting stringent U.N. sanctions imposed in 1990 when Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait. He said the arms inspectors were influenced by U.S. and British intelligence.</p>
<p>The United States, Britain and Kuwait immediately exercised their right of reply. U.S. envoy Edward Gnehm said Iraq could have had the oil-for-food plan if Baghdad had not sent its troops to the Kurdish north at the end of August</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is that the secretariat of the United Nations had informed Iraq in late August that implementation of (U.N. Resolution) 986 could begin in the first week of September,&quot; he said, referring to the measure that sets terms for the plan.</p>
<p>It was the first time there was any official confirmation that the deal had been that close to implementation. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali put the plan on hold until he could be certain U.N. personnel in Iraq were safe.</p>
<p>The plan would allow Iraq to enter international oil markets for the first time in six years to sell $2 billion worth of crude to purchase food and other necessities for its people suffering under U.N. sanctions. The embargoes were imposed in August 1990 when Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>Sahaf said Washington put hurdles in the way of each phase of the negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations before and after the agreement was signed.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of U.S. pressure and interference, the secretary-general has until now been unable to implement the memorandum of understanding (on the oil plan),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said it took 50 meetings to negotiate the deal between February and March, with Washington presenting 29 amendments. It then took another 80 days and 28 meetings to establish implementation procedures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile mortality rates in Iraq have soared for lack of food and medicine. Diseases have become widespread and education and environmental programs have deteriorated, he said.</p>
<p>Sahaf said that President Saddam Hussein's troops went to Kurdish areas in northern Iraq last month to put an end to the civil war, chaos and insecurity, which the United States tried to exploit by missile attacks he said left &quot;many martyrs and wounded civilians.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States and Britain then expanded a no-fly zone in southern Iraq which was illegal in the first place and never called for a Security Council resolution, he claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;I am wondering here: is a state entitled to forcibly impose such a situation on another independent state ...on the pretext of protecting its strategic interests?</p>
<p>&quot;All the allegations and pretexts put forward by the United States to justify its attacks and military buildup against Iraq have no justification in law, fact or legitimacy,&quot; Sahaf said</p>
<p>Sahaf was equally criticial of the weapons inspectors, saying that UNSCOM sent 373 inspection teams with 3,574 inspectors in more than five years in addition to a staff of 90 in Baghdad and asked: &quot;What has this huge army of inspectors been doing for all this long period of time? They did not come to Iraq for a vacation.&quot;</p>
