<p>The Mexico bourse ended sharply higher on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers and analysts said investors stepped back in to the market to buy stocks after a sharp recovery in Sao Paulo quelled fears carried over from Tuesday's trading of fallout from plunging prices of Brazilian equities.</p>
<p>Preliminary figures placed the leading IPC share index up 93.35 points when the closing bell rang, or 1.99 percent, at 4,787.70.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's rebound was more than just technically grounded, it shows a return of market confidence,&quot; said Hector Jimenez, an analyst with the Inverlat brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;We reacted in tandem with other markets, a sort of domino effect,&quot; Jimenez added, referring to rallies in New York and Brazil. &quot;Bancomer and Telmex hauled us up.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of most active stocks traded in Sao Paulo ended up up 8.81 percent at 12,641 points. The Dow Jones meanwhile soared 63.17 points to a record close of 8,038.88.</p>
<p>Dealers said brisk trading volume of 114 million shares underpinned the strong presence of buyers in the bourse.  </p>
<p>Financial firm Bancomer rose 33 centavos to 4.38 pesos and telecomms company Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) ended up 35 centavos at 20.65 pesos. The two stocks together accounted for almost 30 percent of all shares traded during the session. Telmex ADRs rose 1-7/16 to end at 52-1/4.</p>
<p>Garcia said some brokers began to position themselves ahead of second quarter earnings reports expected in the coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;Players with liquidity on their hands took advantage of the slide to pick up bargains. All we have on the horizon now are Q2 earnings,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;They are stepping into food, beverages, tobacco, construction and transportation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Beverage firm Fondo Economico Mexicano was near the head of the prominent gainers' list  PG.MX after rising 4.30 pesos to 53.00 pesos in brisk trade. Construction firm Tribasa also traded strongly and advanced 1.30 pesos to 24.60 pesos.</p>
<p>On the broad market, gainers outpaced sliders by 85 to 21, out of a total of 124 stocks that changed hands.</p>
