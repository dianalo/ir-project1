<p>South African health officials said they had identified an African visitor as the source of the deadly Ebola virus contracted by a nurse, who remained in a critical condition in hospital on Sunday.</p>
<p>Marilyn Lahana, a 46-year-old mother of two working in Johannesburg's upmarket Morningside Clinic, was diagnosed with Ebola after complaining of headaches and stomach pains earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Officials said she remained in a critical but stable condition on Sunday in the intensive care unit of the Johannesburg Hospital.</p>
<p>Though South African health authorities have treated Ebola cases before, Lahana was the first person to contract the disease inside the country.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Gauteng provincial health department said a doctor from Gabon, treated in the Morningside Clinic recently for fever and multiple organ dysfunction, was tested on Saturday and showed traces of the virus.</p>
<p>&quot;He came in with a raging fever and no one really knew what was wrong with him. He had the multiple organ dysfunction that is a symptom of Ebola, but not the haemorhage that is typical,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The doctor, whose name was not released, responded to steroid treatment and recovered, but a blood test showed that he had traces of Ebola.</p>
<p>Health officials said there was no public health threat from the disease, but the spokeswoman said Lahana's family was being closely monitored.</p>
<p>&quot;The experience seems to be that it is the immediate caregiver who is most at risk and not so much family who had less direct contact,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Without early treatment, Ebola, which killed 245 people in Zaire last year and 35 people in two outbreaks in Gabon ealier this year, is fatal in 80 to 90 percent of cases.</p>
<p>With early diagnosis, the fatality rate can be lowered to around 30 percent, South African doctors said.</p>
<p>The Ebola case came in the wake of a Congo Fever outbreak in the ostrich-farming town of Oudtshoorn earlier this month, which killed one women and made 16 seriously ill.</p>
<p>Both diseases kill by causing massive internal bleeding and organ collapse.</p>
