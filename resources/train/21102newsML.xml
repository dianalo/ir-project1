<p>NWE gas oil ended higher on Thursday as benchmark IPE futures surged toward the $200 a tonne mark and traders tested firmer premiums.</p>
<p>Sept IPE closed $5 higher at $196.75, spurred mainly by concerns over low gas oil stocks in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>On the cargo market, two low sulphur cargoes traded at Oct IPE +$15, cif Le Havre for second half September delivery and traders said there was still considerable interest from French refiners for 0.05 percent material.</p>
<p>A French refiner was also heard bidding for GOM at Sept IPE +$6.50, cif Le Havre.</p>
<p>There was also talk of stronger German heating oil cargo premiums at Sept IPE +$4.50/+$5.0, cif Hamburg, for Sept 10-20 delivery but no deals were reported.</p>
<p>&quot;There's definitely strong German interest but these premiums seem pretty high,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>On the Russian side, traders said cargoes were scarce. Traders premiums for first half September delivery were being bid at roughly Sept +1, but no offers were heard.</p>
