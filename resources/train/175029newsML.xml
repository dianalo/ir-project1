<p>The Italian embassy declined to comment on Wednesday on a report that Rome may soon prohibit Italian nationals from working in Colombia because of leftist guerrilla activity.</p>
<p>At least three Italians have been kidnapped in Colombia this year, including two engineers abducted by suspected leftist guerrillas in August.</p>
<p>Colombia has the highest rate of abductions in the world and about half of all cases are blamed on rebels seeking to raise money for their long-running war against the state.</p>
<p>An Italian embassy spokeswoman said the mission had no comment on the report, based on a communique issued on Tuesday by the Antioquia state government.</p>
<p>The communique said Italian Ambassador Francesco Capece had advised Antioquia Gov. Alvaro Uribe Velez that the Labour Ministry in Rome was considering withdrawing all permits for Italians to work in Colombia because of its growing lawlessness and the lack of any guarantees for their personal saftey.</p>
<p>Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar, in brief remarks to reporters early on Wednesday, did not refer specifically to the threatened pullout of Italian workers in Colombia.</p>
<p>But he said guerrilla violence was putting a damper on foreign investment and added that the government may be forced to suspend the contruction of an important hydroelectric project in Antioquia because of it.</p>
<p>&quot;We're studying the possibility of suspending the project,&quot; Villamizar told reporters, referring to the 393-megawatt Porce 2 project in an isolated area of northern Antioquia along the Porce River. The cost of the project was estimated at $546 million in 1993 and it is due for completion in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously this would set a nefarious and bad precedent,&quot; Villamizar added of the possible suspension of the hyproelectric project, which is being built by a consortium of four Italian engineering firms and one Colombian company.</p>
<p>Villamizar said Italians involved in the project were working under a constant threat of guerrilla violence but he did not elaborate.</p>
