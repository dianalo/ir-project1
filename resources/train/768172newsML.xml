<p>Expenditure on alcoholic drinks in India rose 150 percent from 1992 to 1996, with Indian-made foreign liquor leading sales, market research group Euromonitor said in a report released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Total expenditure on alcoholic drinks rose to 261 billion rupees ($7.3 billion) in 1996, Euromonitor said.</p>
<p>Sales of Indian-made foreign liquor, which encompasses whisky, brandy and white spirits, accounted for 51 percent of sales by monetary value in 1996. Country liquor, which is produced and sold outside organised channels and has been banned in several Indian states on health grounds, made up 38 percent of value sales.</p>
<p>Beer expenditure, which accounted for 21 percent of total sales by value, is rising as a result of increasing disposable incomes and greater social acceptance of beer drinking.</p>
<p>Although wine currently accounts for less than one percent of total sales, it is expected to be one of the fastest growing sectors by 2001, with two Indian manufacturers, Indage and Grover Vineyards, attempting to develop the market.</p>
<p>Retail sales of alcoholic drinks reached 60 billion rupees in 1996 with a volume of 480 million litres. Domestic companies are expected to continue to dominate the market, while foreign companies are forecast to gain an increasingly important role through joint ventures, Euromonitor said.</p>
