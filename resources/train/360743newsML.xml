<title>pakistan: Two Pakistanis killed after Christian-Moslem clash.</title>
<headline>Two Pakistanis killed after Christian-Moslem clash.</headline>
<dateline>MULTAN, Pakistan 1997-02-06</dateline>

<p>Two men were killed, apparently by police bullets, after enraged Moslems rampaged through Christian-populated villages in Pakistan's central province of Punjab on Thursday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>At least 19 other people including a policeman were injured in the clash in the villages in the Shantinagar area near Khanewal town in southern Punjab, the witnesses and local officials said.</p>
<p>Local officials reported earlier that one Moslem had been killed, but local residents said another man had died later.</p>
<p>A curfew was imposed in the area and army troops and police patrolled the streets, barring any outsider from entering the villages, after thousands of Moslem attackers were reported to have set fire to Christian houses and damaged churches.</p>
<p>Moslems accused the Christians of committing blasphemy by throwing torn pages of the Koran into mosques. The Christians denied the allegation.</p>
<p>The trouble began on Wednesday night when pages torn from the Koran, carrying the names of several Christians living in Shantinagar, were thrown into several mosques as Moslems were praying after the day-long Ramadan fast, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>After announcements were made from local mosques accusing the Christians of desecrating the Koran, thousands of Moslems rampaged through Christian villages.</p>
<p>Local Christians denied that any members of their community were involved in throwing pages of the Koran into mosques, and some said the local police could have done it to avenge a Christian protest last month against alleged police excesses.</p>
<p>Some Christian residents accused the attackers of burning their homes, assaulting women and killing their cattle.</p>
<p>Several women with torn clothes were seen in the area when troops patrolled there.</p>
<p>Most of Pakistan's 131 million people are Moslems, but there is a small Christian minority, some of whose members have been accused by radical Moslem clerics of blasphemy in recent years.</p>
<p>Thursday's incident happened three days after the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, which authored a 1992 law raising the punishment for blasphemy to death, swept Monday's national elections.</p>
<p>In February 1995, two Christians, one of them a 14-year-old boy, were sentenced to death for blasphemy in the Punjab capital of Lahore, but were acquitted on an appeal and then emigrated to Germany.</p>
<p>Then-prime minster Benazir Bhutto vowed at the time to alter the blasphemy law to make it less open to abuse, but pressure from religious parties blocked any change.</p>
