<title>USA: James Joseph to stay on as Oklahoma bond adviser.</title>
<headline>James Joseph to stay on as Oklahoma bond adviser.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>James Joseph has agreed to stay on as Oklahoma's bond adviser, ending a months long search for a replacement.</p>
<p>&quot;For family reasons I needed to stay in Oklahoma for at least another year, and as it turned out they were deadlocked on trying to find a replacement,&quot; Joseph said Wednesday. &quot;So it made sense for all of us to reach an agreement that I'd just stay on.&quot;</p>
<p>The agreement was reached on Thursday.</p>
<p>In January, Joseph announced plans to resign the post he has held since September 1991 to become a partner at Government Finance Group Inc, an Arlington, Va, financial advisory firm.</p>
<p>John Petersen, the firm's president, and Joseph are long-time friends, Joseph said.</p>
<p>&quot;He was very understanding about my need to be here, and we just agreed that we'd look at it again in the future if it made sense for both of us...but right now there is no commitment,&quot; Joseph said. &quot;They have a great firm, and I wish them well.&quot;</p>
