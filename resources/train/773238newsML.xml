<p>Cook County Chief Financial Officer Thomas  Glaser said Friday he plans a refunding of $75 million of general  obligation debt in a negotiated deal pricing August 12.</p>
<p>Glaser said the recent rally in the market made it possible to seek  the refunding, the third in the past year for the county that includes  the City of Chicago.</p>
<p>Cook County anticipates saving about $2.4 million with the refunding  and will have saved more than $12 million through refundings in the  past year, Glaser said.</p>
<p>Glaser said Cook County expects to return to the market in mid-1998  for the next phase of its capital improvement plan financing ongoing  construction of the new County Hospital.</p>
<p>Cook County has issued about $125 million of bonds for estimated $552  million hospital. The next issuance could be for part or all of the  remaining costs, depending on market conditions at that time, Glaser  said.</p>
<p>BA Securities Inc will serve as the senior manager for the refunding  deal in August, with Smith Barney Inc serving as a co-senior manager  for the deal, Glaser said, adding that he hoped to sign off on the  official statement Friday.</p>
<p>Cook County commissioners authorized refunding of up to $554 million  of general obligation debt in March 1996. The latest refunding is  set to close Aug. 27.</p>
<p>Chapman &amp; Cutler has been designated bond counsel with Caldwell &amp;  Associates as co-bond counsel, Glaser said. Sonnenschein, Nath &amp; Rosenthal  will serve as underwriter counsel with Carney &amp; Bros as co-counsel,  he said.</p>
