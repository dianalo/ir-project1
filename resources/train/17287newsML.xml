<headline>Baltic Freight Index static, activity is modest.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) stood unchanged at 1,119 points on Tuesday in what shipbrokers said was a fairly subdued post-holiday London dry cargo market.</p>
<p>Biffex futures tended weaker with most-traded October down 11 at 1,255 in thin volume.</p>
<p>Brokers said there had been some follow-through selling after the futures slipped on Friday ahead of the three-day UK holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The futures market was unnerved at the end of last week by word that Marubeni fixed 52,000/54,000 heavy grains U.S. Gulf/Japan at what was seen as a disappointing $22.00 for first quarter 1997.</p>
<p>Brokers saw good technical support at 1,250 basis October, but one added that post-holiday activity in the physical market on Tuesday had not seen anything to turn sentiment around. Another said that fresh inquiry so far this week had been &quot;enough to hold things steady...one or two bits and pieces. It was possibly slightly disappointing&quot;. Reported fixtures suggested no dramatic moves. Fu Zhou Hai was said to have been fixed 52,000/5 heavy grains US Gulf/Japan 3/10 September at $20.70 with no combination to charterers EMC. Timecharters reported on Tuesday included 1983-built La Pampa 139,650 dwt delivery Japan 15/25 September trip via East Australia redelivery South Korea at $7,650 daily to Hanjin. The Atlantic Capesize Index calculated by the research department at shipbrokers Simpson Spence and Young (SS&amp;Y) rose to 3,571 points, up 124 points from a week ago.</p>
<p>SSY commented that &quot;the firm Atlantic market of recent weeks has been attributed to positional factors. &quot;Most of the activity this week focused on 2nd half September and 1st half October fixing, where rates were higher. There was limited activity on the Atlantic to Pacific route. However, in the Pacific activity was predominantly Pacific to Atlantic&quot;.</p>
