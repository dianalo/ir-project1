<p>Belgian shares, once again the victim of wild mood swings on Wednesday, comfortably gained 0.89 percent but at the same time wondered how long the euphoria would last.</p>
<p>Relief after Tuesday's FOMC decision, after the close on Tuesday, to leave rates unchanged and the rise on Wall Street and bonds, pushed the Bel-20 index up 19.83 points to 2,247.83 -- just 24 points below its all-time high.</p>
<p>But the thought of new record levels prompted acute vertigo for the Belgian market which feared again the U.S. engine would soon start sputtering again.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything hinges on New York,&quot; said Gert De Mesure at Delen Bank.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks, still pleased that the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged, built further on Tuesday's gains in early business on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But traders said that the next batch of U.S. data could already make the bubble burst.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 will also have to overcome a new bout of dividend coupon payouts on May 27 en route to any new record levels.</p>
<p>Insurer Fortis AG was the day's leading gainer with a 3.3 percent rise to 6,540 francs.</p>
<p>De Mesure said AG might be moving in sympathy with Dutch financial group ING, which was lifted nearly six percent by new details of its profitability.</p>
<p>Electronics firm Barco rose 1.6 percent to 6,370 but De Mesure noted it had slipped in recent days from 6,540.</p>
<p>One trader noted that Barco was also being supported by buying related to the imminent bourse listing of Belgium's Flemish regional investment company GIMV.</p>
<p>GIMV's main interests include 33.5 percent of Barco.</p>
<p>The Flemish government, which owns 85 percent of GIMV, will float 14.8 percent of its holding.</p>
<p>Cement maker CBR was one of two Bel-20 losers, dropping 15 francs to 3,480. De Mesure said it appeared to be under pressure from one seller.</p>
<p>Non-ferrous metals firm Union Miniere was down slightly most of the day on profit-taking, but recovered near the close to end unchanged at 2,880.</p>
