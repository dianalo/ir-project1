<title>CAMBODIA: Senior officials pledge to seek peace in Cambodia.</title>

<p>Cambodia's feuding coalition parties gathered hundreds of senior government and military figures in the capital on Tuesday and told them to stay out of politics.</p>
<p>The bid to avoid civil strife comes after mounting tension between co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the royalist FUNCINPEC and Hun Sen of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP).</p>
<p>A committee of eight members from the two parties told more than 500 military, police and government officials to remain neutral.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that through this meeting we can convince national and international public opinion that leaders of the civil service and armed forces control their institutions neutrally,&quot; the CPP's co-Interior Minister Sar Kheng said in an address.</p>
<p>He read out a set of principles agreed on by the committee, including neutrality, peaceful resolution of conflicts, no unauthorised movement of forces and national reconciliation.</p>
<p>The meeting won cautious praise from diplomats and international donors, who have been concerned over continuing political instability.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a start. Hopefully the two prime ministers will be influenced by this,&quot; said one Asian diplomat.</p>
<p>The parties' relations reached an all-time low in the wake of a deadly grenade attack on a rally led by opposition leader and Ranariddh ally, Sam Rainsy on March 30.</p>
<p>Matters worsened when a handful of royalist dissidents broke from Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party in a move condemned by the prince but championed by Hun Sen, triggering coup rumours.</p>
