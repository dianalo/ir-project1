<p>Firemen worked on Thursday to dig miners out of collapsed tunnels in southern Peru after an earthquake killed at least 14 people and injured hundreds.</p>
<p>Rescuers dug out four men trapped underground by Tuesday's quake, said fire chief Victor Potestad, coordinating operations around Nazca, 290 miles (460 km) south of the capital Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;I was buried for 26 hours. I had to carve out a space with my own hands for about two yards (metres) so that air got in and I did not die,&quot; Juan Churata told Reuters. He said he had been trapped with his brother in a gold mine about 12 miles (20 km) from Nazca.</p>
<p>In another mine at nearby Huanca, falling rocks smashed the shoulder-blade of Lorenzo Huamani, 41, after he ran out of a collapsing tunnel. He told Reuters from his hospital bed in Nazca he believed there were people still trapped in tunnels but thought most of the 500 or so miners, including children, at the mine were above ground when the earthquake struck.</p>
<p>Early reports on Tuesday said as many as 300 workers were trapped at the Huanca gold mine. But after searching the area the Peruvian fire service announced late on Wednesday there were no trapped miners.</p>
<p>At least two miners were still stuck in a collapsed tunnel about 20 yards (metres) below ground in another mine at Guanillo, 12 (20 km) east of Nazca, Potestad said. &quot;There have been signs of life from within the tunnel. There are definitely people down there,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Flying into several mining villages near Nazca, doctors treated 14 children and 49 adults, most of whom suffered bone fractures and head injuries caused by falling debris.</p>
<p>Early morning mist kept the army from flying in equipment to rescue miners trapped in the Guanillo mine and most roads in the area were closed.</p>
<p>Freelance gold miners in Peru -- Latin America's second largest producer -- account for about 40 percent of national output. Small family groups usually work the same mine, using primitive technology to carve out tunnels.</p>
<p>The quake that shook southern Peru and rocked Lima for a minute measured 6.4 on the Richter scale. Its epicentre was 65 miles (100 km) southeast of Ica. Experts expect aftershocks to continue for another week.</p>
<p>The hardest-hit towns were along the Pacific coast: Nazca, where 300 were injured, and Ica, where 200 were injured.</p>
<p>In Nazca, Transport Minister Elsa Carrera said the government was working to demolish partly destroyed buildings &quot;that could be a tremendous threat to the population because at any moment an aftershock like we have just felt could cause more walls to collapse.&quot;</p>
