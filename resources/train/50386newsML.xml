<p>European gasoline markets were tighter on Thursday after rising U.S. prices on Wednesday sucked 150,000 tonnes across the Atlantic, traders said.</p>
<p>At least three cargoes were heard to have been sold on Wednesay and prices had gained $3 a tonne by midday in Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>One of the sellers, based in the U.K., said his cargo contained 40,000 tonnes of M4 non-oxygenated gasoline, with an octane level at 87, as well as 20,000 tonnes of V4, a 93 octane quality with oxygenate allowed.</p>
<p>Another 60,000 tonne cargo of mixed grades was heard sold out of Antwerp, while another 28,000 tonne cargo of 48 grade gasoline, loading in the middle of this month, moved out of France.</p>
<p>Prices details were confidential although one refiner said he thought the fob NWE price for 87 octane grades was between eight and nine cents under the Oct NYMEX futures screen.</p>
<p>One dealer said he thought a Scandinavian player may also have sold some Italian barrels across the Atlantic. This was not confirmed.</p>
