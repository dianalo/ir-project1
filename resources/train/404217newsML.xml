<p>Brazil's Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday gave its second and final approval to a constitutional amendment that would allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for an unprecedented re-election next year.</p>
<p>The amendment won 368 votes in the 513-member lower house of Congress, 60 more than the three-fifths majority needed and 32 more than when it was first approved in January.</p>
<p>Cardoso is seeking to undo a ban on re-election that stretches back to the founding of the Brazilian republic in 1889. The bill, which would also allow state governors and mayors to run for a second consecutive term, now advances to the Senate where it requires two more three-fifths majorities.</p>
<p>Cardoso welcomed the vote on the bill, and urged Congress to make progress on structural reforms that have been held up for months.</p>
<p>&quot;The president received news of the result with satisfaction and is confident the same kind of consensus will be repeated when it comes to voting on the reforms,&quot; presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral told reporters.</p>
<p>Reforms of the social security system and the civil service are considered crucial to the long-term success of the economic policies introduced by Cardoso to slash Brazil's previous runaway inflation to about 10 percent last year.</p>
<p>But both were put on hold last year when the government focused all its attention on securing support for the controversial re-election bill from its delicate, multi-party alliance in Congress.</p>
<p>The government's chief whip in the Chamber of Deputies, Benito Gama, speaking shortly after Tuesday's vote, said he expected the civil service reform to be put to its two votes in the lower house by the end of March.</p>
<p>Social security reform, which was approved in a watered-down form last year in the lower house, is currently being rewritten in the Senate to restore its most important points and could be put to a first vote within two months, officials said.</p>
