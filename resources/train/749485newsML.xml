<headline>US spot natgas extends gains on heat, power prices.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot gas prices continued to strengthen Wednesday as heat and outages resulted in record power demand in Texas and forecasts called for warmer weather in the East and Midwest this weekend, sources said.</p>
<p>Feeding the price uptick, traders said, were the larger gains on NYMEX, where August gas futures rose to a high of $2.155, up 3.8 cents.</p>
<p>On the Louisiana Gulf Coast, physical prices rose about two to three cents to about $2.20 per mmBtu at Henry Hub.</p>
<p>In south Texas, prices similarly edged two cents higher to about $2.12-2.15 as temperature highs near 100 degrees F caused a record electricity demand.</p>
<p>Texas Utilities said a record peak demand was reached Tuesday at 19,681 megawatts. A higher demand was expected for today. Tightening supplies further were rumors of several generation units running at reduced levels.</p>
<p>In the Permian Basin market, where supplies were also tight, prices jumped five cents to $2.10-2.12.</p>
<p>Southern California border prices rose seven cents to about $2.30 despite the return of both the San Onofre nuclear units.</p>
<p>The 1,080 MW San Onofre 3 unit, in southern California, moved to about 82 percent power, while the adjacent unit 2, rated 1,070 MW, was running around 97 percent power.</p>
<p>San Juan prices were also higher around $2.10.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, prices gained an average of four cents to about $2.10, with Chicago city-gate gas up around $2.27.</p>
<p>In the East, swing gas at the New York city gate prices were quoted a bit higher at $2.40 at M3 and Zone 6.</p>
<p>Separately, injection estimates for American Gas Association's storage report have ranged mostly from 75 to 80 bcf.</p>
