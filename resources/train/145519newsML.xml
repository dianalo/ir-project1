<p>Broking houses are re-rating Singapore electronics stocks upwards in anticipation of a recovery next year, but warn that investors should be cautious as the comeback is expected to be muted.</p>
<p>&quot;The re-rating is happening because there is a turnaround which I expect to happen by the first quarter of next year. But I don't think the recovery is going to be similar to what we have seen in the last two years,&quot; Patrick Yau, an analyst at Schroders Securities, told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. September semiconductor book-to-bill ratio, which rose to 0.99 from 0.93 in August, led analysts to predict the Singapore electronics industry could rebound in the first to second quarter in 1997.</p>
<p>But the question remains whether the month-to-month improvement in book-to-bill is a cyclical or seasonal upturn, as the improved data comes at a time when orders usually pick up for the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, electronics stocks on the Singapore bourse jumped back to life after some broking houses called for buys in certain electronic counters, among them semiconductor equipment maker Advanced Systems Automation, which leapt over 30 percent this week. ING-Barings re-rated the electronics sector to a buy from a sell.</p>
<p>But David Toh, electronics analyst at ING-Barings said he too was cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;Having adopted an overweight position for the sector, we continue to remain stock selective in our approach to the sector and would avoid companies with poor management and track records,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said they did not expect a spectacular run in Singapore's electronics counters.</p>
<p>&quot;Share prices tend to lead on expectations. If the recovery is in six to nine months, the buying will start to come in now. But I don't think we will see one longdrawn (period of) buying,&quot; said Timothy Wong, research manager at Vickers Ballas.</p>
<p>&quot;We should see prices gravitating upwards through the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said companies with strong prospects had an upside potential of 30-40 percent before their shares become fairly valued based on projected 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw electronics stocks being bumped up from (a price earnings ratio of) 14-15 times in 94-95 to about 18-19 times. I expect this time round the re-rating should be no more than 17 times, about half of what we saw in the last two years,&quot; said Yau.</p>
<p>He said the electronics recovery would be modest as global personal computer growth would be around 17-18 percent in 1996 and 1997 compared with 25-30 percent in 1994-95.</p>
<p>&quot;If this optimism is carried too highly, actual demand does not fall in place, 1997 would have similar problems with inventory corrections and cutbacks in production again. I wouldn't chase stock prices up from where they are now,&quot; Yau said.</p>
<p>Toh said year-on-year growth for Singapore's electronics industry would stay poor for the rest of 1996 but that smart money was beginning to look for attractively priced stocks in anticipation of a rebound in mid-1997.</p>
<p>Analysts said they recommended buys on companies that were niche players or diversified with a strong regional presence.</p>
