<p>The rebel-appointed head of the Zairean mining giant Gecamines is seeking foreign fund managers to provide badly needed hard currency to help revamp what was once the world's fifth leading copper producing firm.</p>
<p>Mbaka Kawaya Swana, managing director of Gecamines (Generale des Carrieres et des Mines), told Reuters in an interview on Thursday night that his firm needs $1 billion to restore mining operations to 1960 levels but a few hundred million dollars would be enough for a start.</p>
<p>At its peak, Zaire produced up to 476,000 tonnes of copper in 1986 but mismanagement, neglect, corruption and political strife combined to cut output to 132,000 tonnes in 1992 and a mere 40,000 tonnes last year.</p>
<p>Cobalt output has plunged from 40,500 tonnes in 1986 to 6,500 tonnes in 1992 and 4,100 tonnes last year.</p>
<p>&quot;These are huge cuts and my challenge is address problems that have beset the industry,&quot; Mbaka, a metallurgist, said.</p>
<p>Mbaka hopes to maintain copper and cobalt output levels at 40,000 and nearly 5,000 tonnes respectively this year.</p>
<p>Mbaka said cobalt output had been briefly disrupted in the first few months of this year but was now back on track.</p>
<p>He said foreign funding to revive the mines was essential but he ruled out wholesale privatisation as an answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I need $1 billion to restore Gecamines to a level when it boasted being the world's fifth largest copper producer and the world's leading cobalt producer,&quot; Mbaka said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I know I will not get that kind of money so I am scouting for a few hundred million in single-unit projects to revive our operations.&quot;</p>
<p>Mbaka said he would encourage the privatisation of mining operations only after their chore activities are restored.</p>
<p>&quot;To privatise now would be tantamount to giving away our resources because the industry is so badly run down that you would have to sell it for next to nothing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila named Mbaka chief executive last week with a mandate to rehabilitate the industry and help raise the country's foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire now controls about three quarters of the vast Central African country, including all mineral-producing areas.</p>
<p>For Kabila, holding the mineral centres has become a double asset: he has cut off President Mobutu Sese Seko from his mining income and he has been able to keep the mines running for the benefit of his own movement.</p>
<p>Mbaka was confident that with Kabila replacing Mobutu's government with a functioning professional team, Zaire could become an even more important source of minerals.</p>
<p>Mbaka foresees mining specialists for copper, cobalt, diamonds, zinc and gold willing to risk much higher investments once the political and economic climate became clearer.</p>
<p>&quot;The former administrators of this country never bothered to reinvest in the industry. They merely used it as a fat wallet, they looted from it,&quot; Mbaka added.</p>
<p>Kabila's alliance last month awarded the Kolwezi copper/cobalt tailings project to U.S.-based America Mineral Fields Inc (AMF) in a $1 billion deal which also included building a 200,000 tonne a year zinc smelter at Kipushi near the Zambian border.</p>
