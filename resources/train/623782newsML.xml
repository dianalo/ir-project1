<p>Italian debt markets held in negative territory as investors freted over the on-going row between the Bundesbank and Bonn on plans to revalue gold reserves which heightened worries over the future of EMU.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's rejected Bonn's gold revaluation plan Wednesday, but today German Finance Minister Waigel justified the plan and said it doesn't interfer with central bank independence, but Bundesbank officials still defiant.</p>
<p>Market digesting row which on one hand suggests EMU might have to be delayed, but on the other hand suggests criteria could be loosen which may allow Italy into EMU in first wave.  </p>
<p>&quot;The uncertainty does nothing to help the Italian market, although the Italian government must be smiling at the mess the Germans have got into,&quot; said one BTP futures trader.</p>
<p>Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said that Italy is no longer the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; of Europe after Bonn's controversial plan, while Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said he believed the Maastricht Treaty's strict criteria for EMU membership could be interpreted more flexibly.</p>
<p>But dealers said overall worries over EMU after Italy had determinely set out to join had caused market jitters and investors were looking for a safe haven for their money.  </p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher added today that the German central bank's rejection of Bonn's intentions to revalue its reserves may be enough to block a required change in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;This row is not going to just lie down and die and it will be unnerving the markets for some time,&quot; said the BTP trader.</p>
<p>The Italian bond market was cautious ahead of the government's three-year economic strategy plan which the cabinet is due to approve on Friday. This DPEF plan outlines taxing and spending plans for the next three years.</p>
