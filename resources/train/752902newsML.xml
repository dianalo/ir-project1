<p>Shuttle diplomacy has become de rigeur in dealing with the political crisis in Cambodia, and ousted premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh is racking up the air miles to make sure his voice is heard.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, who has crossed three continents in the past two weeks to meet government and United Nations leaders, made a flying visit to Thailand on Thursday to meet special U.S. envoy on Cambodia Stephen Solarz to discuss how best to solve the problem in his homeland.</p>
<p>Their meeting place -- a VIP room at Bangkok's international airport -- was fitting of the whirlwind nature of the political efforts undertaken by both men.</p>
<p>Solarz, who earlier on Thursday met Thai premier Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, later left for Phnom Penh to have talks with Hun Sen -- the man who ousted Ranariddh as First Prime Minister in a bloody July 5-6 coup.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, who met Solarz just minutes after arriving from Indonesia, was later due to jet off to Beijing to meet his father, King Norodom Sihanouk.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week he visited Singapore and Jakarta.</p>
<p>Ranariddh has vowed to travel the world to drum up international support for a non-violent solution to the crisis in Cambodia in an effort to prevent civil war.</p>
<p>The usually-talkative prince, who had been warned by Chavalit on Wednesday not to use Thailand as a base for political manoeuvres, went through back exits and did not pass the waiting media after the meeting.</p>
<p>But a senior member of Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party told reporters after the hour-long meeting that the two had positive discussions and said they thought the &quot;same way.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Ranariddh planned to go to China, Japan and then return to Europe. Ranariddh was in France during the bloody takeover in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Diplomats said French-educated Ranariddh is completely at home in diplomatic circles, and was likely to be jetting about the world because it is the best way he knows how to deal with the crisis in his country.</p>
<p>&quot;What else can he do?&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;He has to do something, and it keeps him in the public eye. It doesn't surprise me that this is his angle.&quot;</p>
<p>Ranariddh appears to be the one with the most to lose in the latest wave of diplomatic mediation. Although he won the 1993 U.N.-sponsored election in Cambodia, he was forced into a power sharing government with Hun Sen, who commanded more military support.</p>
<p>He told a news conference on Saturday in Bangkok that he had agreed to step down and name his successor if Hun Sen would follow a set of pre-conditions.</p>
<p>But the plan, part of a mediation effort by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), was scrapped when Hun Sen rejected the ASEAN intervention.</p>
<p>However, Hun Sen has since changed his position and said he was willing to allow ASEAN to have a mediating role.</p>
<p>It was not clear if the previous plan, agreed to by both Ranariddh and Sihanouk, would again be presented to Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Under the previous plan, Ranariddh would step down if Hun Sen promised not to accuse or try him for any crimes. In addition, those politicians loyal to Ranariddh who had fled Cambodia must be allowed to return to Phnom Penh to work.</p>
<p>He also said his successor would have to work with Hun Sen in a caretaker government as laid out in the 1991 Paris Peace Accords that paved the way for the 1993 election.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said the caretaker government must then prepare for free elections to be held by next May.</p>
