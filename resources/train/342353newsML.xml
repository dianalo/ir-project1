<p>The Australian dollar tumbled to 10-month lows Wednesday as a benign inflation report stoked market speculation of an imminent easing in interest rates.</p>
<p>The risk of narrowing yield differentials spooked offshore investors who dumped the dollar through its August trough of US$0.7680 and threatened 3-year old trendline support.</p>
<p>The flows were not all one-way since the yen had so many headaches the currency climbed close to 4-1/2 year highs there. But the losses on the US$ dominated and dealers could see nought but gloom ahead while the uncertainty over rates lingered.  </p>
<p>By 4.30 pm (0530 GMT) the dollar had fled to US$0.7673/78, it lowest local finish since March 1996, from an early US$0.7684/89 and US$0.7730/35 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The break of US$0.7680, a correction low from August, left the dollar precariously poised on major trendline support which stretched all the way back to September 1993.</p>
<p>A close beneath here would confirm a fullblown downtrend was underway which could carry the currency to 75 cents and beyond.</p>
<p>Dealers said exporter bids had offered some support but the market did not seem overly short and the persistent rate cut talk had many investors running.  </p>
<p>The market has lived in fear of another easing since the Reserve Bank caught it on the hop with its last cut to 6.0 percent on December 11, the third move in five months.</p>
<p>Reports of a subdued Christmas sales period and slow employment growth fed those concerns and had the money market betting on a 0.5 point cut as early as the RBA's board meeting on February 4 should inflation prove as benign as expected.</p>
<p>The data duly obliged with the headline consumer price index up just 0.2 percent in Q4, the lowest quarterly rise since Q4 1993, while annual growth of 1.5 percent was the lowest in almost three years.  </p>
<p>The key measure of underlying inflation rose 0.4 percent on the quarter and in annual terms slowed to the bottom of the Reserve Bank's 2-3 percent target range at 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>The data had the money market slathering for an easing and the 90-day bank bill future edged up to 94.30 implying a rate of 5.70 percent against the official cash rate of 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello fed the pack, saying Australia was now a low inflation country which would provide the climate for lower interest rates.</p>
<p>But analysts were divided on whether the Reserve Bank would choose to ease at its monthly board meeting next week.  </p>
<p>&quot;With inflation falling, real interest rates will actually rise unless the RBA cuts nominal interest rates,&quot; was one argument expounded by Hans Kunnen, chief economist at Colonial.</p>
<p>&quot;The case if fairly strong for a cut to boost economic growth and job creation,&quot; he said, adding he expected annual underlying inflation to remain below 3.0 percent until 1998/99.</p>
<p>Others thought the RBA would do well to wait and gauge the impact of the 150 basis points of easing already delivered.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are not so different from consensus that they would radically change RBA thinking on policy,&quot; said Anthony Thompson, an economist at HSBC Markets.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given that, a cut next month is still no better than a 50/50 chance and we think the bank will wait for more news on wages and the real side of the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thompson also noted that the improvement in inflation came largely from falling mortgage interest charges and all the other major component groups showed rises.</p>
<p>The recent depreciation in the dollar -- it has fallen over six percent from its December peak of US$0.8212 -- might also stay the RBA's hand given that another cut could reinforce the downtrend and unwind much of the anti-inflationary benefit gained from last year's long rise.  </p>
<p>One caveat to this view is that the dollar has fallen far less in trade weighted terms since the yen and most European currencies have been undergoing declines of their own.</p>
<p>Thus while the TWI was off 0.3 point at 58.5, that was roughly in line with its average for November and December.</p>
<p>Indeed, the local currency actually gained on an ailing yen to hit 93.60/70 yen from 92.66/76 late Tuesday, and AUD/yen makes up almost 20 percent of the TWI.</p>
<p>However, the mere risk of a rate cut week will keep the dollar under pressure against its U.S. counterpart until February 5 at least. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373 1800</p>
