<p>LEFT FRONT'S RED SIGNAL TO EXPENDITURE PANEL</p>
<p>The move to set up an expenditure management and reforms commission has been put on hold primarily due to resistance from the Communist partners of the United Front (UF) government. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram had earlier announced that the commission would be asked to submit its report within four months. Sources said UF partners were reluctant to concretise the proposal because of the sensitive nature of the commission, which would look into the entire gamut of issues relating to the government spending, including administrative expenditure, subsidies and budgetary support to the public sector.</p>

<p>BANKS NEED NOT SHOW THEIR HANDS FOR ISSUES</p>
<p>Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the bourse regulator, has permitted banks and financial institutions (FIs) to go ahead with their public offerings without giving any future financial projections. Prospectuses of banks and FIs would henceforth contain only details of past performance. SEBI sources said manufacturing companies whose projects were financed by the appraising authority in a greenfield project could give projections.  However, these would have to be ratified by the appraising FIs.</p>

<p>TELECOM DEPARTMENT'S BUG-RIDDEN TENDER SCRAPPED AFTER A YEAR</p>
<p>The Telecom Commission has decided to scrap a 1.6 billion rupee tender for purchase of SDH transmission equipment. The decision came one year after the opening of tender as the tender conditions did not clearly mention the technical specifications. This was the first time that a public sector company, the Indian Telecom Industries, was the lowest bidder in any tender floated by the Department of Telecommunications ever since the gates were opened to the private sector.</p>
