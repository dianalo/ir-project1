<headline>cricket-Young guides NZ to formidable tea score.</headline>
<dateline>DUNEDIN, New Zealand 1997-03-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>A fluent 94 not out by Bryan Young had put New Zealand in a commanding position at tea on the first day of the first cricket test against Sri Lanka on Friday.</p>
<p>New Zealand were 203 for two at the interval after Sri Lanka won the toss and sent them in to bat.</p>
<p>Opening batsman Young was six runs short of his second test century, while the other not-out batsman was new skipper Stephen Fleming, on three.  </p>
<p>Young and Matt Horne enjoyed a highly profitable second wicket partnership of 140 in 146 minutes before Horne was dismissed for 66 in the penultimate over of the second session.</p>
<p>Horne, in just his third test innings, was positive and forthright from the outset.</p>
<p>He departed to the seventh ball delivered by medium pacer and Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga when he offered an edge to Roshan Mahanama at second slip.</p>
<p>On an excellent batting pitch, Horne and Young went to lunch with their team's score at 92 for one following the loss of Blair Pocock for 18 in the morning session.  </p>
