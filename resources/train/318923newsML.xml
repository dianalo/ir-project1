<p>Italian information technology group Olivetti said on Monday it was selling its loss-making personal computer company to newly constituted Piedmont International in a deal worth 250 to 300 billion lire ($159 to $190 million).</p>
<p>Chief executive Roberto Colaninno told a news conference that Olivetti would retain a 10 percent stake in Piedmont, which it would have the option to sell in two years.</p>
<p>&quot;For the Olivetti group it is estimated that the overall financial effect deriving from the operation amounts to about 250 to 300 billion lire,&quot; Colaninno said.</p>
<p>One of the investors in Piedmont is industrial holding company Centenary Group, whose president, U.S. lawyer Edward Gottesman, has played a key role in putting together a group of investors agreeing to set up Piedmont.</p>
<p>Gottesman, also at the news conference, said further information on the ownership of Piedmont and its board of directors would be released &quot;in due course&quot;.</p>
<p>A statement said the agreement was preliminary with definite contractual documentation to be worked out in the coming weeks. The deal was expected to be completed by the end of February.</p>
<p>Under its terms, Piedmont will license the Olivetti brand for 20 years, renewable beyond that for a further 20 years. Olivetti's personal computer plant Scarmagno would stay open as part of the deal and would remain under Olivetti ownership but leased to Piedmont for four years.</p>
<p>&quot;Olivetti has not been able in recent years to successfully manage this company. I hope Gottesman will do better,&quot; said Colaninno, who took over his post late last year.</p>
<p>Management at the personal computer company would be decided in coming months but Gianmario Rossignolo, chairman of Electrolux unit Zanussi, had agreed to become executive chairman of Piedmont.</p>
<p>Gottesman said Rossignolo had been offered the option to take an unspecified stake in Piedmont and it was hoped that he would accept.</p>
<p>Olivetti has been seeking a buyer since late last year for the personal computer division, the sector which, under former chairman Carlo De Benedetti, made the company's name in the 1980s but which has since suffered losses in the competitive climate of the 1990s.</p>
<p>On June 30, 1996, Olivetti's turnover in PCs was around one trillion lire ($630 million) with 1,600 employees. In 1995 it sold 720,000 PCs worth 2.2 trillion lire and in the first nine months of 1996 it had a 3.6 percent stake of the European PC market and was the top brand in Italy, accounting for 13.8 percent of sales.</p>
<p>Gottesman said there was no intention of moving any manufacturing out of Scarmagno.</p>
<p>Asked if there would be further lay-offs at the plant, he replied: &quot;We do not at the moment see any further lay-offs but that is for the management of the plant to determine when they have produced a business plan for the future of the business.&quot;</p>
<p>Piedmont would own two marketing and sales companies, one for Italy based at Scarmagno and one for overseas based in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The deal will bring relief to Olivetti which had net financial debt at the end of November of 2.916 trillion lire against 3.028 trillion in October.</p>
