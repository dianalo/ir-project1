<p>Russia said on Monday the commander of its crippled Mir space station, scheduled to carry out crucial repairs on a space walk this week, was suffering from cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing is not to worry,' a doctor at Mission Control told commander Vasily Tsibliyev during a link-up.</p>
<p>'I cannot recommend any medicine for you. Try to rest as much as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Mission Control, Tsibliyev, 43, said he had noticed the trouble shortly after a remote-controlled cargo craft slammed into Mir on June 25 in the worst accident in the station's 11-year history.</p>
<p>&quot;It came as a surprise,&quot; he said during a crackly television link-up with Mission Control at Korolyov, outside Moscow.</p>
<p>The news emerged on the eve of a scheduled dry run of the complex repair work by Tsibliyev, his Russian fellow-cosmonaut Alexander Lazutkin and NASA astronaut Michael Foale.</p>
<p>Journalists could not hear Tsibliyev's description of the trouble due to static. Experts on the ground called it a cardiovascular problem -- relating to the heart, blood supply or lungs. They did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev asked whether he could take any medicine, but was advised against doing so before he and flight engineer Lazutkin enter Mir's damaged Spektr module for the repairs later this week.</p>
<p>Their British-born American colleague will sit in the escape capsule to evacuate all three if something goes wrong during the complex and unprecedented operation.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we have carried out medical experiments using an exercise bike to test the cosmonauts' cardiovascular systems,&quot; Mission Control spokesman Valery Lyndin said after the linkup.</p>
<p>&quot;The doctors' initial reaction is that Tsibliyev is overtired. He has problems with his sleep but his general condition is within the norm&quot;.</p>
<p>A special council of doctors would meet on Tuesday to discuss Tsibliyev's health, Russian Public Television said later, without elaborating.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the council's conclusions might affect the dummy run of the repairs on the cramped station, which are expected to take six hours.</p>
<p>Spektr was holed during the collision and, airless, it is now sealed off from the station. Tsibliyev and Lazutkin are due to undertake the actual repair works on Thursday or Friday night.</p>
<p>Mission Control transmitted a video of a mock-up of the unprecedented repair operation undertaken by fellow cosmonauts wearing bulky space suits in a swimming pool -- the nearest they could get to conditions in orbit.</p>
<p>Foale will be on hand to help his Russian colleagues during the trial run.</p>
<p>The two cosmonauts have prepared their spacesuits for the sortie into the holed Spektr module to reconnect electric cables and restore power from the module's solar panels.</p>
<p>Rapid reactions after the collision allowed the crew to seal off the Spektr as air escaped through the hole. But closing the hatches meant cutting off up to half of Mir's power supply.</p>
<p>A Progress cargo vessel brought repair tools and other vital supplies to Mir a week ago and the crew have now finished unloading it. Among the supplies was equipment to improve communications, making it easier for the cosmonauts to view the training film and stay in contact with Earth during the repairs.</p>
<p>But the crew have been puzzling over the purpose of one bit of equipment they found on Progress.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to get an answer from you, what is that tap which looks like one in the kitchen? Tsiblieyev said in Monday's television exchange. But no one could immediately tell him. &quot;Wait and we will find out,&quot; replied a Mission Control official.</p>
