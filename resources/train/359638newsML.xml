<p>Scotland midfielder Paul Lambert must stay with Borussia Dortmund despite the fact his family has had major problems settling in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;He's staying,&quot; Dortmund manager Michael Meier told Thursday's edition of the German sports magazine Kicker. &quot;There's no question of us releasing him. We still need him.&quot;</p>
<p>The former Motherwell and St Mirren player joined Dortmund at the start of the season and has become a first-team regular and fans' favourite in Dortmund.</p>
<p>But his wife has found life in Germany difficult, prompting Lambert to ponder a move back to Scotland. Glasgow Celtic were reported to be ready to offer more than one million pounds ($1.63 million) to bring the player home.</p>
<p>Lambert may find life more difficult on the field in the second half the season. German international Steffen Freund and Portugal's Paulo Sousa are set to return from injury and will be competing with the Scot for a midfield place.</p>
<p>But Meier said this did not mean Lambert was surplus to requirements. It was not clear when Freund and Sousa would be ready to make their comebacks and it would take time to be sure they had shaken off their injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still two big question marks in defensive midfield for us,&quot; he said.</p>
