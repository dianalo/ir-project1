<p>KELANITISSA GAS TURBINE PLANT COMMISSIONED</p>
<p>A 115 MW gas turbine plant costing 2.1 billion rupees was commissioned by President Chandrika Kumaratunga at a Colombo suburb. It is the largest single power plant in the country and capable of meeting 20 percent of the demand for electricity. The new plant increases the country's grid capacity to 1,500 MW.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga said at the inauguration that the government proposed to reduce dependency on hydropower and hand over the construction and maintenance of new thermal power plants to the private sector.</p>

<p>THE ISLAND PRIVATE SECTOR TO BUILD NEW THERMAL PROJECTS</p>
<p>President Kumaratunga said the construction and management of all new thermal power generation plants will be handled by the private sector on a build, operate and own (BOO) or build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis.</p>
<p>This will enable the government to divert existing resources for rural electrification and upgrading of existing schemes. Thermal power generation capacity will be increased to 45 percent of the total capacity by 1999 from 15 percent at present.</p>

<p>TALKS BETWEEN UNHCR AND TAMIL TIGER REBEL FAIL</p>
<p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has rejected the request by the UNHCR to assist in the transportation of displaced persons to Jaffna. The LTTE said they refused because when the difficulties faced by refugees and returnees missing in the past were brought to the notice of the UNHCR, there was no favourable response from them.</p>

<p>DECISION TO RAISE MEDICAL SERVICES SALARIES BY WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>The government will announce its decision on the dispute between nurses and para-medical services this Wednesday, Minister of Health Nimal Siripala de Silva said. He said the government is faced with a dilemma due to different interpretations by trade unions of nurses and para-medical services of the report on their salary anomalies.</p>
<p>While the para-medical services are demanding an equal salary with the nursing service, the nurses union remains opposed to a similarity in salaries.</p>
