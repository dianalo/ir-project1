<p>The court-martial of the U.S. Air Force's first female B-52 bomber pilot was delayed on Tuesday while authorities asked the Pentagon for permission to proceed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fifth Bomb Wing has asked for permission to proceed with the court-martial from the military justice division,&quot; Major Joe LaMarca, an Air Force spokesman, told reporters. &quot;This is normal because a resignation request is pending.&quot;</p>
<p>First Lt. Kelly Flinn, who is 26 and single, sought to resign from the Air Force with an honourable discharge to avoid being court-martialed on charges including adultery and fraternisation.</p>
<p>She acknowledged having an affair with a married civilian and also having sex with a lower-ranking enlisted man, violating the military code of conduct.</p>
<p>Her lawyers also sought to delay the trial until June 2 to give the Air Force time to consider her request. The judge in the case, Col. Dennis Kansala, said previously he would hear arguments about a postponement.</p>
<p>Unnamed Pentagon officials said on Monday that Flinn was unlikely to receive an honourable discharge from Air Force Secretary Shiela Widnall, who sits atop the chain of command considering her request.</p>
<p>LaMarca told reporters that officials at Minot Air Force Base asked the Pentagon whether to proceed with the trial after Flinn's lawyers submitted her conditional resignation Monday afternoon. LaMarca would not comment on how long it would take the military justice division to respond.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, everything's on hold,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The court-martial was scheduled to be held in a small military courtroom on the sprawling base. Reporters planned to watch the proceedings in a viewing room equipped with a closed-circuit television feed.</p>
<p>Conviction on adultery charges in a military trial is punishable by penalties that could range from a dishonourable discharge to fines and imprisonment. Critics argued Flinn's case highlighted a double-standard in the way the U.S. Armed Forces treats the issue of adultery among its male and female staff.</p>
<p>Flinn's lawyers argued she was being unfairly persecuted for something commonplace in civilian life. But Air Force officials said the matter boiled down to broader violations of the code of conduct, including disobeying orders and lying during an official investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have very high standards for the military,&quot; Defence Secretary William Cohen said in an interview with ABC's &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are reasons for maintaining these high standards in order to have discipline and high morale,&quot; Cohen said.</p>
<p>Asked if adultery should be an imprisonable offence for military personnel, Cohen said: &quot;We expect them to function under extraordinary circumstances and so we do have different standards for those in the military than those in civilian life.&quot;</p>
<p>Flinn's lawyers said if she recieved a less-than-honourable discharge from the Air Force, it could preclude her from flying for the National Guard or the military reserves. It might also hinder her civilian job prospects such as becoming a commercial airline pilot.</p>
