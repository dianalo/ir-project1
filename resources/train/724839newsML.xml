<p>Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, returned to Washington's National Cathedral on Saturday to watch their eldest daughter walk down the aisle 27 years after their own wedding there.</p>
<p>The 90-year-old cathedral was the setting as 23-year-old Karenna Gore and Andrew Schiff, a 31-year-old doctor from New York, exchanged vows.</p>
<p>The bride wore a gown designed by Vera Wang and carried a bouquet of Virginia roses tied with double-edged satin. Kristin Gore, the bride's sister, was the maid-of-honour.</p>
<p>Sarah Gore, the bride's other sister, and Ashley Schiff, the groom's sister, served as bridesmaids while Scott Schiff, the groom's brother, was best man. Groomsmen were Thomas Dewey, the groom's cousin, and Albert Gore III, the bride's brother.</p>
<p>Published reports said singer Aretha Franklin would serenade the couple with a selection from Puccini's La Boheme and two traditional love songs. More than 300 guests were on hand as the couple tied the knot, but at least one partygoer arrived late.</p>
<p>President Clinton missed the ceremony as he was flying back from a weeklong trip to Europe, but he attended a black-tie reception at the vice president's residence.</p>
<p>The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea, sent their regrets and remained overseas.</p>
<p>At the reception, guests dined on minted lamb in tomato cups before dancing under an air-conditioned tent on the lawn of the Naval Observatory.</p>
<p>In an intereview in the Washington Post this week, the vice president said &quot;Tipper and I are very happy and very pround of Karenna and thrilled about her marriage to Drew.&quot;</p>
<p>Following a honeymoon trip, the couple will reside in New York. Karenna Gore, who worked as an editorial assistant at the on-line magazine Slate, will attend Columbia University Law School in the fall. Schiff is a primary care physician at New York Hospital.</p>
