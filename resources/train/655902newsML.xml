<p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki called on Thursday for an international debt forgiveness programme to be extended to more Third World countries.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Paris Club of creditor nations launched the programme last year, holding out possible debt write-offs of up to 80 percent for about 25 of the poorest countries.</p>
<p>Uganda has been identified as the first country to benefit, and will have about 20 percent of its $3.5 billion debt forgiven in April next year. Other probable candidates in Africa include Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Mozambique and Togo.</p>
<p>But Mbeki, speaking at the Cape Town launch of a U.N. Development Programme report on poverty, said the programme should take in more countries.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be debt forgiveness,&quot; he said in reply to a question on the potential for sub-Saharan African to emerge from poverty.</p>
<p>&quot;I think some of the steps that have been taken with regard to the least developed countries, where there has been this debt forgiveness, I think it's a matter that needs to extend to a larger number of countries,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important to forgive this debt because if you don't, to talk of development becomes difficult...Clearly it's fundamental to any prospect of development in the continent,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
<p>German Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development Carl-Dieter Spranger, addressing the launch via a satellite hook-up, said his country had already written off debt owed by countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;But we think the debt does not really remove the reason for poverty,&quot; he said through an interpreter.</p>
<p>&quot;Why were these debts made? What expenditure was financed by these debts, very often not necessary expenditure? This is the question all politicians will have to ask themselves, so the debts can be placed in a better perspective,&quot; Spranger said.</p>
<p>Africa has a total international debt of $340 billion which costs $24 billion a year to service.</p>
<p>The United States has said it plans to urge its G7 partners at their summit in Denver later this month to join an initiative aimed at encouraging growth and development in Africa.</p>
