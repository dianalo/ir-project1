<p>Mexico economists have revised downwards their expectations for 1997 economic growth and say the peso will end the year slightly firmer than they predicted last month, a central bank survey showed.</p>
<p>The monthly survey of 27 private sector economists conducted by the Bank of Mexico, and leaked to the press on Friday, showed average expectations for 1997 GDP growth had slipped by 0.16 percentage points to 4.81 percent from 4.97 in the April survey.  </p>
<p>They also said the peso was likely to end the year at 8.64 to the dollar compared with last month's forecast of 8.69, Mexican daily Reforma quoted the survey as showing.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment was expected to total $7.946 billion -- 4.3 percent more than last year -- and inflation was likely to maintain its downward trajectory, ending the year at 17.26 percent compared with 17.48 estimated last April, the poll said.</p>
<p>The survey showed economists expect construction and manufacturing to contribute most to GDP growth this year, with rises of 9.51 percent and 6.88 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The trade surplus for 1997 is likely to contract by 63.7 percent compared with 1996, they said, ending the year at $2.37 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;In this way, it is expected that the current account deficit will total $5.89 billion,&quot; Reforma quoted the survey as saying. ((-- Caroline Brothers, Mexico City newsroom +525 728 7905))</p>
