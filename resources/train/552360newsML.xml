<p>Taiwan wants to keep close contacts with Hong Kong after the British colony's July 1 takeover by China, a Taipei negotiator said on Wednesday before leaving for Hong Kong for crucial shipping talks.</p>
<p>Chang Liang-jen, deputy secretary-general of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, was scheduled to hold talks with Hong Kong Shipowners Association chairman George Chao, Beijing's designated negotiator, in Hong Kong on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Cross-strait relations have been severed for more than 40 years,&quot; Chang told a news conference, referring to the Taiwan-China rivalry. &quot;But Taiwan-Hong Kong relations have never been interrupted and should not be interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;The sides should maintain close contacts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the channel through which more than US$30 billion worth of Taiwan investments have poured into China since the late 1980s, when a political thaw encouraged expansion of unofficial Taiwan-China ties.</p>
<p>Taiwan has warned of painful consequences if no deal is reached over Taiwan's shipping link with Hong Kong -- including a possible halt to bilateral sailings.</p>
<p>At issue is what flags ships should fly when plying routes between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-registered ships will fly the Chinese flag above the future Hong Kong flag after China assumes control over the territory on July 1 following 150 years of British rule.</p>
<p>Taipei has said it would welcome ships flying the red five-starred flag of the communist People's Republic of China, but only if Beijing and Hong Kong tolerate Taiwan vessels that flew the flag of the exiled Republic of China.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to recognise the Republic of China, which has ruled the Nationalist redoubt since losing the mainland in a civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>Taiwan, which prefers to maintain the status quo in shipping links with Hong Kong, would like to make as few changes as possible, Chang said.</p>
<p>Taipei has proposed that both Taiwan and Hong Kong ships lower all flags and identify themselves through telex communications before entering each other's waters.</p>
<p>Chang urged his Hong Kong counterparts to be practical.</p>
<p>&quot;The shipping matter should not be politicised,&quot; Chang said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade, investment and transportation links between Taiwan and Hong Kong are mutually beneficial. The Taiwan side will adopt a pragmatic attitude in a shipping link arrangement.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the Hong Kong side can face the talks with the same attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>If both sides could not agree in Hong Kong, a new round of talks would be held in Taipei, Chang added.</p>
<p>Taipei had proposed to host the talks at the end of April. But a Taiwan official accused Beijing of interfering with the talks and prohibiting Hong Kong negotiators from coming to Taiwan.</p>
