<p>Stock market bears have roamed through Canada's financial capital in the past few weeks, but the bulls may be rearing their heads again, some analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling the worst is over for the Canadian market. Particularly since I think the commodity sector is going to be doing considerably better,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. market may remain pressured by interest rate concerns, but he forecast a divergence between markets in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dunnery Best, director of private client investing at Canadian brokerage Midland Walwyn, said he believed the recent decline was a consolidation that was near its end.</p>
<p>&quot;Has it run its course? I would say largely,&quot; Best said.</p>
<p>Despite rosy predictions by some strategists, technical analysts were pessimistic about longer-term prospects for the market and questioned the enthusiasm of market watchers who watch fundamental factors.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key TSE 300 Composite Index, the bellwether for Canadian equities, has fallen about 10 percent from its all-time high of 6348.02 on March 11. As of Monday, the market was down 4.2 percent for the year.</p>
<p>Rising U.S. rates ignited a brushfire of market fears and prompted a raft of selling.</p>
<p>Concerns in Canada also were fanned by Bre-X Minerals Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta-based exploration firm whose shares plunged on March 26 when partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. said it found &quot;insignificant&quot; gold on its Indonesian gold property, touted as the largest gold find this century.</p>
<p>The Bre-X saga hit key Toronto gold issues hard.</p>
<p>Some analysts voiced hope that the 10 percent correction meant the market was poised to rebound.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still bullish on the market,&quot; said Peter Dawkins, director of research at Midland.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that this is a healthy correction,&quot; he added. Dawkins said the market should recover and break record levels later this year.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 was up 40.37 points at 5,719.70 on Tuesday, boosted by unexpectedly weak U.S. consumer price data, which offset a surprising climb in core producer prices last week.</p>
<p>But others observers maintained the recovery was temporary and that there was more blood-letting to come.</p>
<p>Katherine Beatty, a technical analyst with MMS International, called Tuesday's rally a &quot;a knee-jerk reaction&quot; and forecast at least another 5 percent pullback.</p>
<p>Technical analyst Joe Ismail at brokerage Maison Placements Canada said the market must rally by about 300 points in the next few days to prevent more losses.</p>
<p>&quot;On the strength of that rally, we will be able to tell whether we are going to be able to make new highs or if we're going to backtrack,&quot; Ismail said.</p>
<p>He said the major Toronto sub-groups -- banks, base metals and precious metals, must participate to make a rebound last.</p>
