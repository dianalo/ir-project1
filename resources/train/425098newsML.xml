<headline>RTRS-Village Roadshow sees better trend.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-03-06</dateline>

<p>Theme park and cinema operator Village Roadshow Ltd said on Thursday trading in January and February had been better than expected and this trend was forecast to continue for the remainder of the 1996/97 year ending June 30.  </p>
<p>&quot;In Australia, the first half trading was adversely affected through the lack of blockbuster product being released,&quot; Village said.</p>
<p>&quot;January and February results have been better than expected and this trend is forecast to continue for the rest of the year,&quot; Village said.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, the second half will have the full impact from cinemas opened in December half together with further new cinemas opening.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier, Village reported a 27 percent rise in net profit to A$26.1 million for the first half of 1996/97.  </p>
<p>There was no dividend declared.</p>
<p>Village said its Warner cinemas bought in December in Britain and Germany had contributed a small profit to the first half results and were currently running 15 percent ahead of budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Village said its radio division had had a good year, considering a fall in the metropolitan radio market size.</p>
<p>&quot;Profitability has been maintained due to a reduction in interest expense following the repayment of a significant portion of debt,&quot; it said.</p>
