<p>For those who lost relatives in the Oklahoma City bombing Thursday's formal pronouncement of the death sentence for Timothy McVeigh brought little solace.</p>
<p>Several victims' relatives who faithfully attended the 11-week trial returned to Denver to hear U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch formally impose the death sentence on the 29-year-old Gulf War veteran.</p>
<p>But if they were looking for clues to explain the April 19, 1995, attack on the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people they were left empty handed.</p>
<p>McVeigh spoke briefly, quoting the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis: &quot;Our government is the potent and omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.&quot;</p>
<p>The comment is from a dissenting opinion the liberal high court justice wrote in a wiretapping case against bootleggers in Washington state in the late 1920s.</p>
<p>Courtroom spectators were disappointed. &quot;It didn't mean a whole lot to me. I was disappointed that he didn't have something that he could say on his own instead of quoting somebody,&quot; said Roy Sells, whose wife Lee was killed.</p>
<p>Charles Tomlin, whose son Rick, 46, died in the blast, said the sentence brought him no joy. &quot;I feel sad that we have to do this. This is a human being and I think we as a society need to find out what can cause people to go this route.&quot;</p>
<p>Marsha Kight, whose 23-year-old daughter Frankie Merrell was killed in the blast, said she would have preferred that his remarks represent &quot;something from him personally.&quot;</p>
<p>Diane Leonard, the wife of secret service agent Donald Leonard, who was killed in the bombing, saw McVeigh's statement as laying blame for what happened on the government.</p>
<p>&quot;That's where his idea of blame has come from from the beginning. I think that's what he has in his mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Victims in Oklahoma City who were hoping for something meaningful from McVeigh's remarks also were disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;He set an example to other extremists. The government didn't do this, he did it,&quot; said Catherine Alaniz, whose father Claude Medearis was killed in the bombing.</p>
<p>Priscilla Salyers, who worked in the U.S. Customs office on the fifth floor of the Murrah building, said McVeigh was again looking to blame anyone rather than himself.</p>
<p>&quot;He is just trying to put blame on somebody else and not take responsibility for his own actions,&quot; Salyers said.</p>
<p>Scott Robinson, a Denver attorney who attended the bombing trial said the quotation reflected McVeigh's anger over the April 19, 1993, government showdown with the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, that left 80 people dead.</p>
<p>But McVeigh did not read in court the sentence from the Brandeis dissent that followed. &quot;If the government becomes a law breaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites everyman to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.&quot;</p>
