<p>Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co could become the first U.S. utility to fall to a hostile takeover after a lack of shareholder support forced it to abandon its eight-month, $1.7 billion friendly merger agreement with UtiliCorp United Inc.</p>
<p>Rival bidder Western Resources Inc is now expected to sweep up Kansas City, capping a successful raid on the company and potentially spurring a wave of hostile utility mergers, analysts agreed.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a brave new world out there, and hostile takeovers are now a part of that, rather than the old shake hands and come out smiling,&quot; said Penelope Adelmann, Gruntal &amp; Co utility analyst.</p>
<p>KCP&amp;L is still playing defense because it has been opposed to Western's $1.9 billion offer, but analysts say Western has already won over KCP&amp;L shareholders in its five-month takeover battle and it will likely succeed.</p>
<p>A source close to KCP&amp;L said the company was still recommending shareholders not tender shares to Western.  </p>
<p>The next step is KCP&amp;L shareholders considering Western's offer of $31 in Western stock per KCP&amp;L share.</p>
<p>If a majority of shares back the deal, Western said it would, if necessary, vote out the directors in order to close the transaction. The offer expires October 25, and can be extended by Western if necessary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Wall Street was already buzzing with speculation about the next utility that might attract an unwanted bidder.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly opens up the hostile as another possiblity. I think it will be a trend,&quot; said Linda Byus, Nesbitt Burns utility analyst.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is significant industrywide because it shows shareholders now have a say. Historically, utility retail shareholders -- the moms and pops, widows and orphans -- have gone along with management. But this is a wake-up call that managements work for shareholders,&quot; Byus said.</p>
<p>To be sure, Adelmann said, hostile takeovers do not suit every company.</p>
<p>&quot;When Western has a particular goal in mind, they go after it strongly. So hostile takeovers take a particular type of management, and there are not many like Western,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>&quot;With a hostile, you have got to use your own management (in the company after a takeover) and feel you can make it with your own people,&quot; Adelmann said.</p>
<p>&quot;If Western is smart, they will do what they can to include KCP&amp;L's management. It would be a mistake to chuck out what's there,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Roger Conrad, editor of the Utility Forecaster newsletter, said: &quot;KCP&amp;L's management looks like they still want to stay away, but for shareholders the thing to do is tender to Western. It is more than likely Western will succeed.&quot;  </p>
<p>A recent issue of the Forecaster identified some potential takeover target, including Citizens Utilities Co, Energen Corp and Central Louisiana Electric.</p>
<p>Six weeks ago, another hostile offer was announced. MidAmerican Energy Co launched a bid to break up a friendly three-way merger by offering $1.2 billion in cash and stock, or $39 per share, for IES Industries Inc.</p>
<p>IES agreed last fall to combine with Interstate Power Co and WPL Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>One of the few hostile utility mergers previously attempted -- all have failed -- included Western's predecessor company and KCP&amp;L, Conrad said.  </p>
<p>Five years ago, KCP&amp;L made a hostile run at Kansas Gas and Electric Co, but Kansas Power &amp; Light came in as a white knight and merged with KGE to create Western Resources.</p>
<p>Conrad said KCP&amp;L's decision to back out of the UtiliCorp pact has &quot;enormous implications because if the Western deal comes off, it shows utilities don't necessarily need the approval of the other board to launch a takeover. So we will see more of these types of deals, or at least more pressure to enter negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>More hostile deals &quot;will increase the valuation of the entire industry,&quot; and one can expect to see more utilities bolster their defenses with creation of poison pill and golden parachute provisions, he added.</p>
<p>In addition to KCP&amp;L shareholder support, a Western merger would require the approval of numerous regulatory agencies and the states in which the utilities operate, the analyst said.</p>
