<p>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday said that if inflation were allowed to get out of hand it would hurt the expansion.</p>
<p>Greenspan, in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said that he preferred that any legislation that altered the mandate of the Fed not have specific numerical goals.  </p>
<p>He said that the healthy economy was the result of efforts to acheive a low inflation rate, adding &quot;If we allow that to get away, we will at the end of the day find that we have set in motion a set of forces which bring the long sustainable, stable recovery to an end.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about proposed legislation to change the Fed's mandate to focus on the sole goal of fighting inflation, Greenspan said,</p>
<p>&quot;What we would like to try do is to try to construct language which effectively reproduces what we think works as monetary policy,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Rather than have specific numerical goals or things of that nature, which sometimes are difficult, (we would like to see) a legislative vehicle which you feel accomplishes your goal but in our judgment is consistent with how we do things so that there's no communication as to what Congress wants us to do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked about the significance of &quot;storm clouds&quot; arising from a potentially overly exuberant stock market, Greenspan responded: &quot;They're not necessarily dangers.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the stock market activity is merely a reflection of the fact that overall risk premiums in the economy have fallen. Part of the reason for that decline is expectations of continued low inflation.</p>
<p>Greenspan said the Fed must be &quot;vigilant&quot; in ensuring that inflation remains under control.</p>
