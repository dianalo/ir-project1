<title>Slovakia: Household consumption boosts Slovak GDP growth.</title>

<p>Slovak gross domestic product (GDP) rose 6.9 percent year-on-year in second quarter 1996, boosted by an 8.2 percent growth in household consumption, the Statistical Bureau (SUSR) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last year, second quarter GDP grew 7.1 percent, slightly above growth in household consumption of 7.0 percent, the SUSR said.</p>
<p>The Bureau said it had revised down its forecast for GDP growth for the whole of 1996 to 7.0 percent from 7.1 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the latest figures were in line with expectations, as the negative aspects of Slovakia's foreign trade deficit of 31 billion crowns ($1.01 billion) for the first seven months of the year had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a danger that the GDP has been driven too much by household consumption rather than other factors,&quot; Charlie Robertson of London analysts Hilfe, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that there will be further pressure on the central bank to help correct this,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>GDP in the first half of this year rose a real 7.1 percent. Full 1995 GDP grew by 7.4 percent and household consumption for the whole year increased by 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say a figure of between six to seven percent GDP growth is more realistic,&quot; Robertson said.</p>
