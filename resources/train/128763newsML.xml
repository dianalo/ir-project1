<headline>Carnival receives world largest cruise ship.</headline>
<dateline>TRIESTE, Italy 1996-10-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Carnival Corp has taken delivery of the &quot;Carnival Destiny', the world's largest cruise ship, after its completion by Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri.</p>
<p>Fincantieri said it had handed over the 100,000 plus gross tonnne ship, which is taller than the Statue of Liberty, on Saturday in a ceremony at its Monfalcone shipyard in northeastern Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;The &quot;Carnival Destiny' is the world's largest passenger ship of all time,&quot; said a statement from Fincantieri, part of state industrial holding IRI.</p>
<p>No price was given for the 270-metre vessel, which was completed in 20 months and is big enough for 3,400 passengers and 1,000 crew with 16 decks and 1,320 cabins, most of which had ocean views.</p>
<p>The cruise liner also has a nine-deck high atrium, a theatre seating 1,600 people, two restaurants of 1,050 and 750 seats and four swimming pools.</p>
<p>Fincantieri, which has chalked up three consecutive years of profits after years in the red, said its current order books included nine vessels for an aggregate value of 5.5 trillion lire.</p>
<p>The largest cruise ship had previously been the 77,000 tonne &quot;Sun Princess' owned by P&amp;O's Princess Cruises U.S. unit, which Fincantieri handed over last November.</p>
