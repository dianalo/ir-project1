<p>Ontario Hydro expects to resume electricity production from several nuclear power units in October in a build up to its peak demand season this winter, a company spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>A 930 megawatt (MW) nuclear unit at Darlington, Ontario, was expected to resume production Tuesday or Wednesday after shutting Aug 23 for maintenance, said spokesman Ted Gruetzner.</p>
<p>The unit is one of four 930 MW units at the Darlington plant, located east of Toronto. The three remaining units were working normally, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>A fifth 540 MW nuclear unit at the Pickering station, also east of Toronto, was expected to resume production on October 15, Gruetzner said.</p>
<p>Startup of the unit was postponed from the original target date of late September.</p>
<p>All eight units at the station, each with a capacity of 540 MW, were shut down April 20 after a problem with a backup valve on an emergency cooling system.</p>
<p>A sixth Pickering unit was scheduled to resume production on October 31, Gruetzner said, adding no restart date has yet been set for the seventh and eighth units.  </p>
<p>The four units which resumed production over the summer were operating normally.</p>
<p>Ontario Hydro has an overall in-service generation capacity of just over 29,000 MW.</p>
<p>Total company production Tuesday was expected to be near 16,000 MW, of which five to six percent would be exported to the U.S., primarily into Michigan and the New York Power Authority, Gruetzner said.</p>
<p>Demand for Ontario Hydro's electricity typically peaks in December and January, with record demand of near 24,000 MW set on January 19, 1994.  </p>
