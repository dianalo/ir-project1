<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, recovering from open heart surgery, will leave hospital for a government rest home on Friday but doctors warned him against taking things too fast.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Kremlin chief doctor Sergei Mironov as saying that he was afraid Yeltsin could have &quot;overstretched himself&quot; on Wednesday, when he worked, went for a walk in the hospital grounds and was interviewed on television.</p>
<p>&quot;Filming is a serious burden, even for a healthy person, and all the more so for a patient who had a heart operation on November 5,&quot; Mironov said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, said during the interview that he was in fighting mood after quintuple bypass operation and would return to work after a spell in the Barvikha sanatorium.</p>
<p>He walked slowly and stiffly, but spoke in a firm voice and there was colour in his cheeks. It was his first public appearance since well before the operation.</p>
<p>The presidential press service said Yeltsin would probably spend two or three weeks at Barvikha, but he could return to work in the Kremlin by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the president was feeling well and his recovery was in line with doctors' expectations.</p>
<p>Mironov said Yeltsin was getting ready for his move to Barvikha, a complex including a sanatorium and government residences just outside Moscow.</p>
