<headline>Brazil Cardoso's PSDB party axes proposed alliance.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB), whose most eminent member is President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has shelved a proposed alliance to become Congress' biggest force after allies objected, an official said.</p>
<p>But the PSDB has won a concession from Brazil's biggest political parties that it can share key nominations to congressional committees, said the PSDB official, who asked not to be named.  </p>
<p>The party, currently the third largest in the Chamber of Deputies with 91 members, announced ealier this month a proposed alliance with the 23-strong Brazilian Labor Party (PTB).</p>
<p>That would have made the PSDB the biggest in Congress, giving it the right to nominate members to congressional posts which are normally reserved for the powerful Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB).</p>
<p>Protests from the government-allied PFL and PMDB led Cardoso to block the PSDB-PTB marriage.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the PSDB insists on this decision, the president of the republic will leave the party. I am speaking in his name,&quot; Communications Minister Sergio Motta was reported to have to told party whips.</p>
<p>&quot;The party would have prefered to have been top dog in Congress, but it is pretty satisfied with the agreement,&quot; the PSDB official said.</p>
<p>The PSDB is riding high on expectations that Cardoso will be allowed to run for an unprecedented second term in 1998.</p>
<p>The day after the lower house gave a first approval to a constitutional amendment allowing re-election in January, three deputies joined the party.</p>
<p>And next week, a further four lower house lawmakers are due to join the PSDB, taking it to 95 members, the official said.</p>
