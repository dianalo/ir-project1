<p>With only four months to go before the most far-reaching reform of British equity markets in a decade, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) says it is confident the launch of an order-driven trading system will go ahead on time.</p>
<p>The October 20 launch date &quot;is more than pretty likely,&quot; Martin Wheatley, head of markets development at the London Stock Exchange, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Embroiled for years in a bitter debate about how to reform the way shares are traded in London, the exchange is the only major stock market in the world where share prices are set by primary dealers, essentially middlemen.</p>
<p>Wheatley, who has co-ordinated the planned introduction of an electronic order-driven system, or so-called &quot;order book&quot; - whereby buy and sell orders are matched electronically - said all indications suggest the market will be prepared for a smooth transition.</p>
<p>&quot;Of all the systems that need to be in place, none that we would identify as risks are coming up as risks at the moment,&quot; Wheatley said.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of the scale of risk, we haven't got anything on our horizon currently that is giving us significant concern that we're going to delay or that the system won't come in an orderly way.&quot;</p>
<p>Readiness surveys conducted by the exchange and anecdotal evidence suggest that the industry is progressing, but, Wheatelry added, &quot;the technology is less of a concern. Training people (to use the system) is a bigger problem.&quot;</p>
<p>The LSE is expected to confirm the launch date in late July. In the meantime, it has been conducting &quot;dress rehearsals&quot; with member firms.</p>
<p>The order book initially will be used for shares in the FTSE 100, Britain's biggest and most liquid shares. At some undetermined point, the order book will be extended to the FTSE 250 stocks.</p>
<p>Yet some more important detailed guidelines still have not been finalised.</p>
<p>The exchange, under pressure from regulators to ensure transparent markets, is still thrashing out the rules under which large trades would be published in the new electronic regime.</p>
<p>For months, it has been among the most controversial issues associated with reform, and in all likelihood, Wheatley said, large trades would have to be disclosed after 70 to 90 percent of a large order was completed.</p>
<p>Consultants Oliver, Wyman and Co in April recommended to the exchange that large trades be published after 90 percent of the deal was completed.</p>
<p>&quot;Regulators took the view that the 70 percent level would be more consistent with how the market operates,&quot; Wheatley said. &quot;There's not a dramatic difference and we've now gone back to the market to find what their sensitivity is between those two levels. Ideally, we'll come up with a compromise.&quot;</p>
<p>Wheatley discarded objections that allowing any reporting delay gives large dealers an unfair advantage. He also scoffed at concerns that the order book could be circumvented entirely.</p>
<p>&quot;The order book is not a mandatory feature of the market. It will be used because it's attractive and people want to use it. Anything we put in place to try to force mandatory use of the order book is always going to force people to try to find a way around it.&quot;</p>
<p>The LSE also is in the process of establishing a central guarantor for order book trades.</p>
<p>Regulators had raised the issue of counterparty risk, noting that the buyer or seller of shares in an order book environment won't be able to identify the counter party or creditworthiness. Under the current system, the identity of the counterparty, and therefore the creditworthiness, is known.</p>
<p>The exchange will announce the details of the newly established unit in about six weeks.</p>
<p>Wheatley said the LSE may institute trading halts if markets become disorderly as a result of index arbitrage-related trading.</p>
<p>The order book will make it easier for arbitrageurs to buy or sell FTSE 100 stock index against index futures, a practice which tends to add volatility into the market.</p>
