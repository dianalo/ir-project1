<text>
<p>Almost all East European stock markets staged strong performances this week, with Warsaw, Prague, Ljubljana and Budapest climbing to highs mostly due to foreign interest or good company results.</p>
<p>Two independent indices climbed to year highs in Bucharest in heavy trading and shares were mixed in Zagreb. Bratislava fought low liquidity, while Tirana had no trades.</p>
<p>The CESI Central European Share Index rose by 5.76 percent on the week to 1,720.36 points.</p>
<p>PRAGUE</p>
<p>The Czech PX50 soared to year highs this week led by strong gains to the index's two most heavily capitalised shares, SPT Telecom and power utility CEZ.</p>
<p>In the week to Friday, the PX50 rose 33.5 points, or 6.1 percent, to 599.7, but dealers cautioned against reading too much into the gains which they said had been partly made on low volume trading.</p>
<p>Dealers said they did not see any fundamental reasons for SPT shares to rise much further, but that CEZ could climb another two or three percent.</p>
<p>WARSAW</p>
<p>Polish shares rose this week, piercing the barrier of 17,000 points and setting 34-month highs on Thursday and Friday, with analysts expecting a new record on Monday.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index rose 8.4 percent this week to 17,457.9 on Friday.</p>
<p>Some analysts said that if the bourse continued to grow in jumps it could soon end up in violent falls.</p>
<p>Some said the bourse, though fairly priced with an average price-earnings ratio of about 15.8, still had upside potential as Poland's economic prospects were good and firms' earnings this year were expected to grow at a fast pace.</p>
<p>BUDAPEST</p>
<p>Profit-taking, which started earlier this week after the Hungarian market hit an all-time high, continued on Friday despite little help for the market from the dollar's strength.</p>
<p>On Friday the BUX index closed at 5,657.33 points, 188.5 points up on the week.</p>
<p>Traders said it was too early to say whether the profit- taking was a correction before new rallies or the beginning of a reverse trend.</p>
<p>BRATISLAVA</p>
<p>Bratislava saw one more week of low volumes, but brokers said the highly undervalued market was starting to show signs of stronger foreign demand, which could put the bourse on a long-term uptrend in the near future.</p>
<p>The 16-share SAX index closed the week at 189.83, or 1.94 percent up on the week.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market still needed a wider range of issues to boost liquidity.</p>
<p>LJUBLJANA</p>
<p>Slovenian shares jumped 4.98 percent this week amid strong foreign demand. The 10-share SBI index soared 78.4 points on Friday to an all-time high of 1,651.96, the week's third peak.</p>
<p>BUCHAREST</p>
<p>Trading stayed lively in Bucharest this week, pushing turnover 10 million lei up on Thursday to 816.3 million and pushing two independent indices to year highs.</p>
<p>Bourse attraction Azomures closed the week 2,700 lei higher at 29,900, but brokers said buy notes amassed in the market for weeks were behind that rise rather than news of Azomures's privatisation after the sale of a 51 percent stake.</p>
<p>ZAGREB</p>
<p>Croatian stocks closed mixed on Friday with further gains among hoteliers, and traders said they expected leading issues to rebound next week after correction.</p>
<p>Fully-listed Zagrebacka Banka ended at 1,836 kuna, down 54 kuna on the week, while drugs firm Pliva was 30 kuna lower at 470 kuna. Hotelier Riviera was Friday's top gainer, closing at 225 kuna.</p>
<p>Analysts said tourist firms were poised for further growth, as they were cheap and could prove lucrative if the summer season was successful.</p>
<p>TIRANA</p>
<p>The Albanian market, shaken by a crisis after the collapse of several pyramid investment schemes, saw no trading this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, there were no transactions either on Thursday or on Monday,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
