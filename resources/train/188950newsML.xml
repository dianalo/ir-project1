<p>Western Australia Premier Richard Court broke with tradition on Thursday and called a pre-Christmas state election for December 14.</p>
<p>Opinion polls and political analysts alike are predicting the Liberal Party/National Party coalition will retain control of the all-important lower house -- the Legislative Assembly -- either in its own right or in some loose confederation with conservative-minded independents.</p>
<p>But political analysts say there is an outside chance the 106-year conservative reign in the upper house -- the Legislative Council-- may finally come to an end.</p>
<p>It is the first time in more than 50 years that the state election has been held before Christmas.</p>
<p>The West Australian newspaper earlier on Thursday said the government decided to go early following party research showing the government was in danger of losing marginal seats in Perth's northern suburbs to the Australian Labor Party (ALP).</p>
<p>The article also quoted unnamed Liberal Party sources as saying the early poll was designed to stifle the campaigns of former Liberals turned independent candidates running in the safe Coalition seats of Alfred Cove, Carine and Esperence.</p>
<p>Liberal Party president David Honey told Reuters the northern suburbs seats could be crucial to the final outcome but denied the independent threat was a major factor in the Liberal's campaign planning.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not a matter foremost on our minds,&quot; Honey said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our task is to beat the ALP. As I have said before the ALP can win the election with 46.5 percent of the two-party preferred vote,&quot; he said. &quot;The fact is 1,900 votes will decide the six seats that will determine who wins government.&quot;</p>
<p>Honey said the five crucial seats were Bunbury, Wanneroo, Joondalup, Ballajura, Yokine and Innaloo.</p>
<p>All are held by the Liberal Party and, with the exception of Bunbury, all are in Perth's northern suburbs. Any one of them could change hands with a swing of two percent or less, based on the 1993 poll and the 1994 state redistribution.</p>
<p>The ALP has only three seats -- Mitchell, Ningaloo and Willagee -- that could change hands with a swing of two percent.</p>
<p>The early date gives the ALP's new leader, Dr Geoff Gallop, only a matter of weeks to make his presence felt.</p>
<p>Gallop swapped jobs in October with then leader Jim McGinty mainly due to the latter's poor showing in opinion polls.</p>
<p>The 57-seat Assembly is currently occupied by 32 Coalition members, 22 Labor and three independent, two of whom are former members of the Liberal Party and one a former Labor MP.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months Labor has managed to shore up one of its main policy weaknesses, in relation to law and order, while also taking full toll of government stumbling in education, health and industrial relations.</p>
<p>But Western Australia voters rarely throw out a government after just one term. Labor also continues to show up poorly in opinion polls despite an electorate-wide lack of enthusiasm for the government. The government also has a much more favourable profile in the key area of economic management.</p>
<p>On the government side, the main fear appears to be that it may have to rely on independents -- albeit conservative minded -- to retain power after the election. This follows a string of defections from the party both by sitting and would-be MPs.</p>
<p>Curtin University Associate Professor of Politics David Black told Reuters opinion polls suggested the government would win but it did have some problems in specific electorates.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it is all over bar the shouting, but the government must be nervous to have a December 14 poll.</p>
<p>&quot;The state is in good economic health, the budget has been balanced, the deficit is down and the government has managed to defuse the major issues like health and education although Labor will probably argue its performance has been disappointing on accountability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, Western Australia is a very regionalised area so you do have blocks of electorates where local stresses can be important,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the Legislative Council 34 members representing six regions are elected by proportional representation.</p>
