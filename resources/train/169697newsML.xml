<p>Democrats picked up two House seats in California and a third race pitting veteran Republican Representative Bob Dornan against a businesswoman was still too close to call on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Democrats' strategy of linking Republican incumbents with unpopular House Speaker Newt Gingrich appeared partially to pay off in Tuesday's election as they picked up two of the seats they had targeted in California.</p>
<p>Benefiting from President Clinton's comfortable win in the state, Democrats also wrested back control of the state Assembly, which they had lost to the Republicans in 1994 for the first time in 25 years.</p>
<p>Two-term Republican Representative Bill Baker from Walnut Creek, east of San Francisco, was surprisingly ousted by Democrat Ellen Tauscher, a wealthy investment banker who spent $1.6 million of her own money on the campaign.</p>
<p>Tauscher, 44, who has never held public office, denounced Baker's conservative voting record and opposition to gun control. Baker, 56, accused her of trying to buy the election.</p>
<p>In the Santa Barbara area, Democrat Walter Capps, a religion professor, comfortably beat freshman Republican Representative Andrea Seastrand. Both Tauscher and Capps had portrayed their Republican opponents as faithfully supporting Gingrich.</p>
<p>The ultra-conservative, flamboyant Dornan, known as &quot;B-1 Bob&quot; for his support of the military, was fighting for his political life against well-funded Democratic businesswoman Loretta Sanchez, a Hispanic.</p>
<p>With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Dornan was ahead by fewer than 250 votes out of more than 80,000 cast. A spokesman for the California Secretary of State's office said the race was too close to call because probably several thousand absentee ballots remained to be counted, a task expected to be completed by Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I make every race a tight race in my mind, looking over my shoulder at all times,&quot; Dornan, a former fighter pilot who briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination this year, told Reuters a week before the election.</p>
<p>Analysts said the race was a test of the growing electoral clout of Hispanics in the district.</p>
<p>California's congressional delegation, evenly divided 26-26 between Republicans and Democrats before the election, will now be made up of 28 Democrats and 24 Republicans if Dornan holds on to his slim lead.</p>
<p>In the presidential race, Bob Dole's all-out effort to capture California's rich prize of 54 electoral votes failed as Clinton won 52 percent of the vote to Dole's 38 percent.</p>
