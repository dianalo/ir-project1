<p>A car bomb exploded in central Algiers on Tuesday, killing six people and wounding scores, including 10 seriously, an official Algerian statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very big one. It shook the embassy,&quot; said a U.S. embassy employee in Algiers reached by telephone.</p>
<p>The Algerian security forces, in a statement read on the state-run Algerian television, said the car bomb went off at 4:50 p.m. (1550 GMT) at Boulevard des Martyrs in the working-class Sidi M'hamed district in Algiers.</p>
<p>An earlier provisional official death toll said the bomb killed five and wounded scores of people.</p>
<p>It was the third blast in Algiers in three days. On Sunday a car bomb killed at least 21 people -- an Algerian newspaper put the toll as high as 42 killed and more than 100 wounded. A bomb exploded outside a school on Monday but caused no casualties.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a foreigner working near Place Addis Ababa in Algiers said: &quot;We heard a very big blast about a half hour ago. It was a huge one.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking on Algerian radio a witness said: &quot;I was lying down watching the television when there was a huge noise...They (the bombers) are not human beings. They are attacking families, and even old people.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 300 people have been killed in a series of bombings and massacres in Algerian cities and villages, mostly in Algiers and surrounding towns, since November.</p>
<p>The leader of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has warned that his Islamic rebel group will step up attacks in Algeria during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan that started on January 10, an Algerian newspaper reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The war will continue and will be intensified during the month of Ramadan. We have the means and the men to punish all those who are not on our side,&quot; GIA leader Antar Zouabri said in a statement posted on the walls of some mosques in northern Algeria and quoted by El Watan newspaper.</p>
<p>At least 160 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded in Algeria since the start of Ramadan. Militant fundamentalists regard the Moslem month of fasting as the month of jihad -- holy war -- against the secular military-backed government.</p>
<p>Political analysts believe the killings are a message to President Liamine Zeroual, as well as to Algerians, that the fundamentalists are still a formidable force despite repeated claims by the government that it has crushed the guerrillas.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
