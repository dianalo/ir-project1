<p>-------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - JULY 17 -------------</p>
<p>+ Brent has repeatedly failed to break through key resistance in the $18.45-$18.48 area, the level of a key falling trendline on the weekly chart.</p>
<p>+ September Brent, which takes up the front-month reins today, has formed a perfect triple top at $18.50 this week and this, too, forms another obstacle.</p>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures face strong resistance at $18.45, $18.48 and $18.50 and this is likely to keep a lid on prices for the moment, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>September Brent crude, which is the new front month from today, closed at $18.30 a barrel on Wednesday, seven cents a barrel down on the day. August gas oil was a dollar firmer at $163.75.</p>
<p>Peter Sceats at CharTech-MCS said Brent would face resistance up at a key falling trendline formed on the weekly chart, dating from mid-May.</p>
<p>&quot;The resistance line for this trend crosses the price action at the $18.47 area in the coming week,&quot; he said in a weekly report which was released early on Monday. &quot;Spot Brent is likely to find strong resistance at that area.&quot;</p>
<p>Front-month Brent reached highs of $18.45, $18.48 and $18.45 respectively on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and this imperfect triple top in itself is likely to reinforce resistance at this level.</p>
<p>On the chart for September Brent has formed a perfect triple top - reaching a high of $18.50 on each of the first three days of this week.</p>
<p>Fenalla Graham at MeesPierson Derivatives in London, employing the Market Profile technique, said she saw first resistance for Brent at $18.45 and then at $18.60.</p>
<p>&quot;Crude markets are hovering up against tough range resistance but do not seem to have the strength to break through as yet,&quot; she said in a daily report. She placed support levels at $18.24, $18.18 and $18.00.</p>
<p>But she warned that while preparation was neutral in Brent and NYMEX crude, products were positive. &quot;With the fear that crudes may take heed of products we continue to buy dips in all markets.</p>
<p>Support for gas oil would be encountered at $163.50, $163.00 and $162.50, while resistance was located at $164.75, $165.25 and $167.25.</p>
