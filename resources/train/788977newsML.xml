<p>Times Mirror said that the transaction will, for financial reporting purposes, reduce its outstanding series A common stock by six million shares and its outstanding 8 percent series A preferred stock by $367 million of stated value. it said.</p>
<p>Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by Times Mirror's board, which will meet to consider the transaction later today, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;This reduction in common and preferred shares will enable us to achieve our target capital structure,&quot; said Mark Willes, Times Mirror chairman, president and chief executive officer.  </p>
<p>At the same time, Times Mirror will continue to use active open market share repurchase program to maintain this capitalization, he said.</p>
<p>Shareholders will benefit from this transaction, he said, adding that it would be accretive to earnings per share in 1997 and add more than 10 cents per share in 1998.</p>
<p>Times Mirror said it will contribute to the limited liability company its real property, with a market value of $226 million, and $249 million in cash.  </p>
<p>The real estate will be then be leased back to Times Mirror under long-term leases, and the cash will be invested in a portfolio of securities of unrelated issuers.</p>
<p>The Chandler Trusts will contribute five million shares of the series A common stock valued at $254 million, and $221 million stated value of 8 percent series A preferred stock.</p>
<p>For financial reporting purposes Times Mirror will be considered to have acquired 80 percent of the shares of the series A common stock contributed to the limited liability company, or about four million shares.  </p>
<p>Times Mirror will also be considered to have acquired 80 percent of the 8 percent series A preferred stock contributed, or about $177 million of stated value. Due to the allocations, the dividends on such shares are effectively eliminated.</p>
<p>The merger will result in the reduction of the series A common stock by two million shares and the acquisition of $190 million stated value of 8 percent series A preferred stock.  </p>
<p>A Times Mirror subsidiary will become the owner of all of Chandis Securities' assets, including approximately 8.6 million shares of Times Mirror's series A common stock, about 9.7 million shares of the company's series C common, about $190 million stated value of the company's 8 percent series A preferred stock, and $21 million of real estate, cash and other miscellaneous assets.</p>
