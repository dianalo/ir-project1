<p>After a secret meeting with General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Jack Smith Wednesday, Canadian Auto Workers union President Buzz Hargrove said he was optimistic about resolving a bitter two-week old strike that has paralysed GM's Canadian plants.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we might have found a way to break the logjam,&quot; Hargrove told Reuters after Smith flew into Toronto for a hasily-arranged two-hour meeting between top officials from both sides.</p>
<p>Hargrove declined to elaborate on the outcome of the meeting, which was held in a hotel near Toronto airport. But he said he would brief union officials and make public the main points discussed at a news conference later Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other high-level officials of the Canadian union predicted that the two sides would soon resume negotiations in earnest to try and end the strike by 26,000 GM workers at Canadian plants.</p>
<p>The strike, which began at midnight on Oct. 2 took a more aggressive turn earlier on Wednesday when 160 striking workers took over one of the carmaker's plants in Oshawa, Ontario.</p>
<p>A Canadian Auto Workers union spokesman said the workers had occupied the fabrication plant after they learned that GM Canada was seeking a court injunction to move key machinery from the plant to another facility in an attempt to keep up component supply to some of its U.S. plants.</p>
<p>The strike at GM's Canadian unit has already disrupted supply of components to other factories, idling about 10,000 workers so far in the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>Hargrove is due to meet with the strikers occupying the plant in Oshawa, about 30 miles (50 km) east of Toronto, later Wednesday.</p>
<p>GM Canada spokesman Stew Low told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that GM turned to the courts after the union refused its requests to help GM keep the stamping machinery in Oshawa working despite the strike.</p>
<p>&quot;So really we're put in a box with no other choice but to ... seek an injunction and bring legal action to remove the dies so we can continue to supply to our customers,&quot; Low said.</p>
<p>The union went on strike after contract talks broke down over the issue of shifting union jobs to outside companies and over GM's plans to sell the Oshawa fabrication plant and the Windsor, Ontario trim plant.</p>
<p>Hargrove has said negotiations were hijacked by GM's top executives in the United States, adding that they wanted to test the CAW's resolve ahead of a possible settlement with the United Autoworkers union in the United States.</p>
<p>The CAW has set a special dues meeting for Oct. 18 to raise additional strike funds from all its 210,000 members. The union has said its strike fund, which was at $37 million when the walkout began, could support a 12-week strike and stretch to 16 weeks if new credit was arranged.</p>
