<p>Economic growth in the Dynamic Asian Economies (DAEs) will remain slower near-term as nations in the region keep monetary policy tight, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.</p>
<p>&quot;Slower economic activity in the DAEs is expected to continue in the short term as slower export growth exerts a negative impact on the spending plans of the business sector,&quot; the OECD said in its semi-annual economic outlook.</p>
<p>The Paris-based think-tank includes Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia in the DAE category.</p>
<p>But stronger consumer demand and investment in China sparked by expected interest rate cuts should help to enliven Asian exports somewhat in 1997, the organisation said.</p>
<p>After several years of economic activity close to or above full capacity utilisation, tighter monetary policies put in place by many DAEs at the end of 1995 began slowing growth and inflation over the course of this year, the OECD said.</p>
<p>&quot;This may indicate that the DAEs have shifted to a more sustainable pace of growth,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Countries in the region are expected to keep monetary policy tight. Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan in particular were unlikely to cut rates significantly given their need for strong inflows of foreign capital to fund external imbalances, it said.</p>
<p>Malaysia and Thailand may also be forced to limit public spending to curb widening current account deficits, it said.</p>
<p>Trade balances remained an area to watch.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the DAE's current cost and price competitiveness positions, their aggregate current account deficit is expected to stabilise over the projection period to just under $15 billion, almost twice the level for 1995,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Regional exports grew less than 10 percent in dollar terms in the first three quarters of 1996, against 20 percent in 1995, affected by the fall in world demand for electronic goods, loss of competitiveness against Japanese products due to the yen's depreciation, and rising labour costs.</p>
<p>Import demand has remained strong due to rising infrastructure investment and consumer demand along with widening trade deficits, particularly in Thailand and China.</p>
<p>The OECD said the generally short-term measures taken by many DAEs have added considerably to uncertainties over export prospects and pessimism among financial investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk of capital volatility and exchange rate pressures may not disappear rapidly, and the possibility of devaluations may arise, leading to further monetary and fiscal tightening and probably slower than projected growth,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>China was ahead of other Asian economies in clamping down on excess growth, and the significant fall in its inflation rate has occured without a further slowing in growth, the OECD said.</p>
<p>Rates were cut in May and August, and some further easing may be undertaken in early 1997, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer demand and investment are expected to strengthen over the next two years, leading to somewhat higher rates of output growth and inflation than projected for 1996,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Stronger demand from China and Japan are expected to boost regional exports gradually in 1997, although the DAEs will have to rely increasingly on internal demand to sustain output growth, the OECD said.</p>
