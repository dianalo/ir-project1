<title>ITALY: Two Italian ex-premiers to stand trial for graft.</title>
<headline>Two Italian ex-premiers to stand trial for graft.</headline>

<p>Two former Italian prime ministers whose Christian Democratic party (DC) was wiped out by huge corruption scandals in the early 1990s were ordered on Monday to stand trial on charges of graft and illegal party funding.</p>
<p>Arnaldo Forlani, whose seven-month government was brought down by the P2 Masonic lodge scandal in 1981, and Ciriaco De Mita, prime minister for 13 months in 1988 and 1989, were ordered to stand trial with six others in Rome on September 15.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that they received bribes from businessmen seeking contracts to build a plant for state electricity group Enel in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Another senior member of the DC and a businessman were also involved in the investigation, but were given sentences of six months and one month respectively after plea-bargaining.</p>
<p>The other six defendants were three businessmen, another senior DC party member, a senior official of Enel and a former boss of the state highways board.</p>
<p>The prosecution charges Forlani and two others with illegal party funding for allegedly receiving 900 million lire ($535,000). De Mita, together with Forlani, faces other charges of having received two bribes, the first of 450 million lire and the second 300 million.</p>
<p>Both men have faced corruption charges before. A court earlier this month upheld a 28-month prison sentence for Forlani for illegal party funding in what Italians have dubbed &quot;the mother of all corruption trials&quot;.</p>
<p>The Enimont trial involved chemical company Montedison, which paid more than $100 million in kickbacks to get out of a disastrous joint venture with state energy company ENI.</p>
<p>De Mita was investigated for corruption in connection with the misuse of $45 billion of state aid after a 1980 earthquake in Naples. The inquiry was later shelved and De Mita won a seat in parliament in last year's general election.</p>
<p>In another spur for anti-corruption investigators, one of the last major fugitives wanted in the &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; (Bribesville) scandals of the early 1990s returned from abroad on Sunday night and gave himself up to authorities, police said.</p>
<p>Gianfranco Troielli, a former member of the now-defunct Italian Socialist Party, had been at large since 1992.</p>
<p>He was a close friend of former party leader and prime minister Bettino Craxi, who was convicted in four corruption cases and is living in self-imposed exile in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Troielli, who had been living in Kenya, was wanted in connection with bribes paid to political parties in exchange for contracts to build a suburban railway north of Milan.</p>
<p>He was convicted in absentia at a trial earlier this year and sentenced to six years in jail.</p>
