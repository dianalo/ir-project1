<p>Moves to overhaul a rickety apartheid-era pensions system are underway in South Africa. State pension funds are being rationalised and a comprehensive reform programme is under discussion between government, unions and the private sector.</p>
<p>In common with other countries, South Africa faces growing difficulties in providing state pensions in the face of fewer contributors and an ageing population.</p>
<p>Progress has been made in reaching consensus on a new national retirement policy. The first workshop of the national retirement consultative forum -- established to put recommendations to government on the future direction for retirement provision -- was held at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Some observers talk of a pensions crisis, fearing that the problem will worsen. Government moves to cut civil service numbers will cut away the contributor base, putting increasing strain on the state pension fund, they argue.</p>
<p>One long-term solution put forward by the South Africa Foundation -- which represents large companies -- is to manage pension funds privately and replace defined benefits with a legally-regulated pattern of defined contributions.</p>
<p>Reg Munro, general manager for employee benefits at life assurer Old Mutual, highlights progress made to restructure state pension funds since the 1994 democratic elections.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of progress has been made at a detailed level in bringing South Africa's seven or nine funds together so that now we have one fund for all government employees,&quot; Munro says.</p>
<p>During the apartheid era, civil servants' pensions were managed under several state funds which have now been consolidated into one fund -- the Government Employees' Pension Fund (GEPF).</p>
<p>One of the groups appointed to look into the retirement industry and state pension funds after the 1994 elections -- the Smith Committee -- suggested that South Africa continue the partially-funded route for state employees.</p>
<p>Munro says much of the crisis that has arisen is about the change of government.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand you have civil servants saying we trust this government while on the other hand you have some of the old guard unsure about government meeting pension promises that the previous government made,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The key question is how to go forward with the merged GEPF, something which will be debated at the second workshop of the national retirement consultation forum in February.</p>
<p>The first workshop this month -- chaired by Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus and attended by government officials, employers, trade unions and the country's life offices -- set up various committees dealing with specific areas.</p>
<p>They are expected to make recommendations to government at the second workshop in February.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of a workshop has been long overdue and is critical in formulating a national retirement policy,&quot; says Peet Maritz, chief director of government pensions administration.</p>
<p>As part of the move to restructure state pension funds, private fund mangers were recruited after 1995 to manage the Public Investment Commissioners' (PIC) portfolio.</p>
<p>The PIC manages government's pension fund investments and has in the past concentrated heavily on government stock.</p>
<p>But last year it diversified its portfolio to increase its exposure to the equities market.</p>
<p>Private fund managers that manage the PIC's Johannesburg Stock Exchange portfolio are Rand Merchant Bank, Old Mutual, Sanlam, Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd and Southern Life Association Ltd.</p>
