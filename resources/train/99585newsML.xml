<p>The acting governor of Mexico's northern state of Nuevo Leon, Benjamin Clariond, said on Monday that he was prepared to extend his term of office until new elections could be held next July.</p>
<p>&quot;I will agree to stay on until the mandate is over if the deputies vote for that,&quot; Clariond, a businessman and member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said in a television interview.</p>
<p>Clariond has been head of a caretaker government in Nuevo leon since April, when the elected governor, Socrates Rizzo, departed amid widespread allegations of corruption by his administration.</p>
<p>The state congress named Clariond as interim governor for a six-month term in April. Rizzo's six-year term would have ended in July 1997.</p>
<p>If Clariond stayed on, the Nuevo Leon constitution would forbid him from contesting elections for some other post for another six years.</p>
<p>Nuevo Leon is a heavily industrialized state bordering the United States. It accounts for 17 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product, according to the local Employers Council.</p>
