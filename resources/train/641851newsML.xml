<p>South Korea on Thursday vowed to crack down on militant student leaders behind the worst violence on the streets of Seoul in almost a year.</p>
<p>A six-day campus rebellion launched last week by the pro-Pyongyang Hanchongryon student group at Seoul's Hanyang University caused two deaths and wounded several hundred police and students.</p>
<p>The students are demanding the resignation of President Kim Young-sam and details of his 1992 election campaign spending. Prime Minister Koh Kun vowed to put an end to campus violence and ordered the arrest of Hanchongryon leaders by the end of June, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to the public that this enormous disruption in the capital was not prevented in advance,&quot; Koh was quoted as saying in the statement.</p>
<p>Hanchongryon on Wednesday took responsibility for the death of a suspected police informer it admitted beating during an interrogation.</p>
<p>Autopsy reports on Thursday showed that the man, identified by the police as Lee Suk, a 22-year-old worker, died as a direct result of the beatings, a police official who saw the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;His body was covered with bruises which seem to have come from baton blows, punches and kicks, and there are rope marks on his wrists which suggest he was tied,&quot; the official said. &quot;He had lost about 2000 cc of blood.&quot;</p>
<p>A police officer, Yoo Ji-woong, died during clashes around the Hanyang campus with students wielding iron pipes and firebombs.</p>
<p>But an autopsy on Tuesday found he probably died after being hit by a police vehicle, not at the hands of students. His funeral was held on Thursday.</p>
<p>Most of 1,000 students holed up at Hanyang slipped off campus on Wednesday night surrounded by riot police and headed to Seoul National University.</p>
<p>Early on Thursday they carried out an inauguration ceremony at Seoul National for the new Hanchongryon leadership. They also laid flowers at a small altar in memory of the two men who died. Most of the students dispersed after the ceremony.</p>
<p>The chairman of Hanchongryon, Kang Eui-won, said in a statement he would turn over to police the students involved in the beating of Lee Suk and he apologised for his death.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Hanchongryon will continue to demand the resignation of Kim Young-sam and the revelation of details of Kim Young-sam's election funding.&quot;</p>
<p>Last August, police backed by helicopters staged a military-style assault at dawn on another Seoul campus to end violent protests led by the Hanchongryon which ended with 151 arrests.</p>
