<p>A Moslem forensic team found dozens of skeletons in uninhabited woodland under Serb control on Tuesday, believed to be Moslems killed while fleeing Srebrenica over a year ago.</p>
<p>Srebrenica, a small Moslem enclave in east Bosnia, became notorious after Serb forces captured it in July last year, expelled all women and children and massacred thousands of men.</p>
<p>A Bosnian government commission for prisoner exchanges and missing persons recently clinched a deal with the Serbs to recover the dead on the remote Bijelo Polje hill.</p>
<p>A Reuters photographer who followed the team to the site saw dozens and dozens of skeletons lying in a clearing shrouded by a thick forest of tall trees, well away from villages and roads.</p>
<p>The nearest village of Kravica is a few miles (kms) away from the site, on a road between Srebrenica and Zvornik to the north.</p>
<p>A Srebrenica survivor who managed to escape led the commission to the site which has been left unguarded by NATO troops and Serb police.</p>
<p>The only Serb to join the investigation was a member of the exchange commission established to swap prisoners and remains of the dead. He said the bodies were war casualties killed in fair combat.</p>
<p>Srebrenica fell on July 11 in a fierce Serb offensive, and its defenders withdrew into the woods in a mile-long (1.6 km) long column.</p>
<p>The survivor, who remained anonymous, said the huge line of men crept through hostile forests by night and remained hiding during the day.</p>
<p>He said the escaping Moslems chose the Bijela Brdo wood to rest through the day of July 14.</p>
<p>The survivor said Serbs launched an attack in the late afternoon, but the group was too lightly armed to mount serious resistance. An odd rifle and hand grenade could be seen amid a vast array of corpses.</p>
<p>Visibly upset he said: &quot;This is the last place where I saw my brother. Perhaps I'll find him today.&quot;</p>
<p>The ground was littered with personal belongings, passports bearing Moslem names and photographs. Most of the bodies wore civilian clothes, only a few had military boots and fatigues.</p>
<p>Moslem labourers wearing blue overalls and rubber gloves started collecting the bodies in plastic bags.</p>
<p>None of the skeletons appeared to be dressed in women's clothing, but reporters saw childrens' toys and tiny bones, implying at least some children ended their lives there.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe some 12-15,000 people, trying to escape from Srebrenica, passed here,&quot; said Amor Masovic, head of the Bosnian exchange commission. He added all the bodies would be transported to Tuzla for identification.</p>
<p>Of an estimated 20,000 men who tried to break through Serb lines around Srebrenica and trek across wooded hills to government-held territory, up to 8,000 are still missing and feared dead.</p>
<p>No one could say how many bodies lay scattered on Bijelo Brdo. The team inspected only a few hundred metres and said it would continue searching the difficult hilly terrain in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;We have started work along the first two kilometres of their escape route and have already found hundreds of bodies,&quot; said Masovic, adding the team expected to find thousands more.</p>
<p>War crimes investigators, sent to former Yugoslavia by the International War crimes Tribunal, have already excavated several mass graves in east and north-east Bosnia, containing hundreds of bodies believed to be those of Srebrenica Moslems.</p>
