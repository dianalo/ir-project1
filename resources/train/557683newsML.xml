<p>June Brent crude futures in Asia were untraded around midday on Friday, quoted around the London close with technical trading set to lead the market.</p>
<p>June was quoted on SIMEX at $18.18/$18.35 per barrel, after London shed 23 cents to settle at $18.29, near the intraday low of $18.26.</p>
<p>June Brent is expected to be capped for the time being at $18.77, the top of a previous chart gap reaching from $18.64.  </p>
<p>The gap was almost closed in London trading on Wednesday, when June traded as high as $18.75. But its failure to cover the final two cents signalled a lack of upside momentum, analysts said.</p>
<p>Support for June was cited at $18.30.</p>
<p>NYMEX was offering little direction on ACCESS during the Asian day.</p>
<p>June was last traded at $19.92, up just one cent from New York, which fell 30 cents.</p>
<p>ACCESS had traded a range of just $19.96/$19.90 per barrel, on moderate volume of 380 lots, so far in the Asian day.</p>
