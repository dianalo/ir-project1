<p>A Dutch politician on Friday called on the government to consider seeking a stake in the European Airbus group -- a day after hopes of rescuing bankrupt planemaker Fokker NV appeared dead.</p>
<p>Jan van Walsem said that although there were indications that South Korea's Samsung Aerospace Industries remained interested in buying Fokker, Dutch politicians increasingly viewed the Airbus consortium as the most viable channel for its fading aerospace industry.</p>
<p>The Dutch government, was until recently a minority shareholder in Fokker. Fokker's parent Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, withdrew financial support for Fokker in January, leading to its bankruptcy in March.</p>
<p>&quot;We still want to be part of the European aerospace industry. We really want that, but unfortunately it seems we cannot do it with Fokker,&quot; said politician Van Walsem of government coalition member D66.</p>
<p>&quot;But we can't just sit and cry. With a participation in Airbus, many industries would benefit... We would remain busy with high valued-added work and new technology,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dutch Minister of Economics Hans Wijers told reporters that Fokker faced liquidation next year unless a saviour unexpectedly emerged.</p>
<p>&quot;If no serious candidate comes forward then liquidation becomes inevitable at a certain moment,&quot; Wijers said.</p>
<p>His statement came after news on Thursday that Short Brothers of Belfast was no longer willing to supply wings to Fokker and that Fokker's court-appointed administrators had broken off exclusive takeover talks with Samsung Aerospace.</p>
<p>Dutch newspapers on Friday were unanimous in sounding the death knell for Fokker after the remaining orders dry up next May.</p>
<p>&quot;Fokker has definitely died,&quot; said newspaper De Telegraaf.</p>
<p>&quot;All hope for Fokker has flown,&quot; said rival Algemeen Dagblad.</p>
<p>Wim Van Gelder, a member of the coalition government's socialist party member the PvdA, described it as a &quot;terrible shame&quot; that the Koreans had hesitated over Fokker.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a real interest. They wanted more time, but time has run out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, on Friday a Samsung executive told Reuters that Samsung Aerospace Industries continues to seek a takeover of Fokker despite the withdrawal of Shorts.</p>
<p>&quot;Takeover talks have not completely collapsed,&quot; he said</p>
<p>The executive did not explain how Samsung planned to take over and run a company that has no chance of staying in business after its wing supplier had left.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Short Brothers plc, a subsidiary of Canada's Bombadier Inc said it would no longer supply wings to Fokker.</p>
<p>&quot;We will now be able to get on with our future and install on our production lines new work that we are winning,&quot; a Shorts spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>European consortium Airbus Industrie is made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.</p>
