<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-19</dateline>

<p>Markets were wary on Wednesday following a sharp sell off and subsequent rally emanating largely from New York late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said both the downside and the correction towards the close were overdone leaving buyers with the opportunity take advantage of any dips today.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $348.95 per ounce up from $346.30 on Tuesday afternoon when the sell-off was gathering steam and a close of $346.00/$346.50.</p>
<p>Dealers had varying opinions on how the market turned round having touched a low around support at $345.30 late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of call option business and buying of spot later on, supposedly from the same party who sold it earlier,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Another dealer was less certain about the upward correction. &quot;There was the feeling that one of the funds was trying to bully the market higher rather than buy it higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gold needed to get over $350.00 to get clear of current downward pressure, and a move into the $350s would also take that option strike price out of the picture for next Tuesday's over the counter (OTC) options expiry, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>Business was light in early European trading with no currency issues around to bring liquidity into the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>News that the Russian central bank planned to buy 90 tonnes of gold this year for reserves was positive, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything which keeps gold off the market is mildly bullish,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>U.S. February Consumer Price Index data for February were expected to show an ex-food and energy increase of 0.2 percent versus a 0.1 percent increase the previous month, according to economists polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>Silver found support on Tuesday after the professionals sold it down in an unsuccessful attempt to flush out fund positions following repeated failures to extend through $5.30.</p>
<p>&quot;The target yesterday was $5.10 and the market is well capped at $5.20,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum recovered from a low around $370 on Tuesday to be indicated at $375.50/$376.50, up $4.50 and, given a relatively strong fundamental background, should hold well above gold.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if gold breaks to the downside, platinum is going to be better bid,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Palladium was also up on the close at $144.75/$145.75, $2.75 firmer. --Brian Spoors London Newsroom +44 171 542 8058</p>
