<p>Asian stock markets will be waiting to see if Wall Street's winning spree continues as they start this week on a note of cautious optimism.</p>
<p>Dow industrials hit an unofficial record of 5841 points on Friday, encouraged by economic date pointing to moderating economic growth and tame inflation.</p>
<p>The optimistic mood spread to London where the FTSE 100 index reached a record closing high of 3,967.9 points as fears of a big rise in U.S. interest rates eased.</p>
<p>Both Tokyo and Hong Kong put on a strong spurt to finish last week sharply higher and most other Asian markets also gained ground. Bombay was the main laggard and Indian stocks are seen continuing to meander this week.</p>
<p>The wobbly Thai market also looks set for a rough ride as political concerns threaten to negate the effects of a stock support fund due to be introduced on Monday.</p>

<p>TOKYO - The Nikkei 225 average is likely to gain confidence and move in the 20,500 to 21,000 range in the week ahead, inspired by stronger-than-expected GDP data, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment improved after the strong September futures and options settlement this morning,&quot; Masaaki Higashida, strategist at Nomura Securities Co Ltd said. &quot;But then the GDP was released showing the economy was healthier than expected and that should give the market a push.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 rose 398.71 points or 1.95 percent to close at 20,842.64 on Friday, up from 20,152.53 the previous Friday.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - Stocks are expected to head towards their 1996 highs, with strong momentum in interest-rate sensitive property and banking stocks expected to continue driving the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The target might be 11,600 - this year's high,&quot; said Frederick Tsang, head of research at PrimeEast Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index jumped 117.32 points to 11,369.04 on Friday. The index gained 343.45 points last week, or 3.12 percent.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - Despite the launch this Monday of a 10 billion baht ($400 million) government fund to support the market, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index is expected to fall slightly in the coming week on political concerns, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are waiting for a no-confidence debate against the prime minister,&quot; said analyst Samart Rusmeerojwong of James Capel Asia. On September 18, parliament is due to begin debate on a no-confidence motion launched by the opposition against Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa.</p>
<p>After drops early in the week, the SET index gained ground and closed at 1,039.65 on Friday versus 1,007.51 last Friday. - - - -</p>
<p>BOMBAY - Indian shares are likely to drift lower in directionless trade this week, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the market will remain weak,&quot; said Ketan Jhaveri, chief dealer at broking firm Kotak Securities. &quot;There's nothing to push the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange index fell 160.7 points, or 4.8 percent, to 3,347.37 in the week to Friday.</p>

<p>JAKARTA - Jakarta share prices are likely to be mixed this week, with the market focused on medium and small-capitalised stocks in local speculative buying.</p>

<p>KARACHI, Pakistan - Pakistani stocks are likely to open higher on short covering in blue chips when the Karachi bourse reopens after the Friday-Saturday Moslem weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the index closed 31.99 points, or 2.40 percent, up at 1,362.94, compared to a fall of 32.34 points, or 2.33 percent, to 1,353.92 on September 5.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Little change is expected in main board counters on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, but smaller-capitalisation stocks represented by the Second Board could succumb to further profit-taking, dealers said.</p>
<p>Signs of a backing off were spotted on Friday, with the Second Board index losing 1.79 points or 0.31 percent to 572.24 after chalking up early gains. The blue chip-focused Composite Index, meanwhile, added 4.05 points or 0.36 percent to 1,117.55. For the week, it gained 12.22 points.</p>

<p>MANILA - Trading on the Philippine stock exchange is expected to remain sideways as investors continue to await fresh incentives, as well as a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve on interest rates. The main index rose by 23.52 points week-on-week to 3,193.68 points from 3,170.16 points on September 6.</p>

<p>SEOUL - Consolidation of large-cap shares is expected to continue to cast a gloom over the Seoul stock market on concerns about margin loan selling pressure and a gloomy economic outlook. But brokers said expansion of the foreign stock ownership from October 1 would limit sharp falls on the composite index.</p>
<p>The index closed on Friday 785.19, up 1.14 points or 0.15 percent from last Friday's 784.05.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE - Dealers were mixed in their forecasts for this week after the key Straits Times Industrials Index drifted without direction last week.</p>
<p>One institutional dealer said the listless market would probably trade sideways with the index moving within the range of 2,100 and 2,200 support level.</p>
<p>On Friday, the index ended 9.83 points higher at 2,126.27, up 29.57 from last week's 2,096.70.</p>

<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market outlook was seen upbeat in the near term, with the early tone expected to be set by the U.S. market's positive reaction to August inflation data.</p>
<p>The benchmark All Ordinaries finished at 2,252.3, up 15.3 points over the week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's closed well and I suggest that it will kick up again if Wall Street continues to rise. People see the Dow higher but it depends on their CPI number,&quot; said a Sydney dealer.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>TAIWAN - Taiwan share prices are expected to continue recent gains on rising inflows of foreign equity funds since August, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the index ended at 6,471.63 points, compared with 6,290.23 a week earlier. A 6,400-6,600 range was seen for this week.</p>
