<p>Singapore gasoline prices were steady on Wednesday amid listless trade, traders said.</p>
<p>News of China's decision to introduce unleaded gasoline by the year 2000 did little to move the market, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are plenty of gasoline in the market but there are no outlets,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Some traders said Star refinery's closed tender to export 220,000 barrel of 92-octance unleaded gasoline may find difficulty attracting bids.  </p>
<p>One trader in Thailand had inquired about the tender but decided not to place a bid.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at the volume and the lack of buyers, it would be safer not to buy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Star Petroleum Refining Co has issued a closed tender to sell the product for lifting June 2-6.</p>
<p>The tender will close on May 9 and would be valid for two days.</p>
<p>China announced plans that its major cities will use only unleaded gasoline by the year 2000 to try to reduce air pollution caused by auto emmission.  </p>
<p>While Chinese traders said the move is unlikely to impact imports in the short term, citing China had already sufficient MTBE processing plants to produce unleaded gasoline, some traders said they expected imports to rise.</p>
<p>They said China's gasoline imports would rise as not all refineries can produce unleaded gasoline. They also expected China's imports of MTBE to increase.</p>
<p>In the naphtha market, some enquries were heard from Japanese end users but no deals were concluded. Buyers were unhurried to buy as they are plently of supplies, traders said.  </p>
<p>Naphtha swaps edged down with weak cash fundamentals and were quoted around 20 cents lower from Tuesday at $20.80/$21.00 for May and $21.00/$21.20 for June.</p>
