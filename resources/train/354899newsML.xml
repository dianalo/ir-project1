<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York precious metals futures were called to open slightly firmer Tuesday as the bullion market continued to consolidate overnight following last week's slide.</p>
<p>COMEX April gold was called unchanged to $0.20 firmer from Monday's close of $348.50 an ounce. It traded from $347.50 to $348.90 on ACCESS.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $346.30/70 after fixing at $346.30 in London this morning compared to the New York close Monday at $346.40/90.  </p>
<p>Concerns about European central bank sales continues, traders said. A still-strong dollar is pressuring demand for gold in other currencies and Chinese New Year will depress demand temporarily too.</p>
<p>But the market became oversold temporarily last week after the break below $350 to a fresh three-year low and needs to consolidate again, analysts said.</p>
<p>COMEX gold stocks rose 20,319 ounces Monday to 837,074 ounces.</p>
<p>COMEX March silver was called unchanged to 0.3 cent firmer from Monday's close of $4.902.</p>
<p>COMEX silver stocks rose 600,050 ounces Monday to 195,449,509 ounces.</p>
<p>NYMEX April platinum was called unchanged to $0.30 higher from the previous close of $355.70, with NYMEX March palladium called unchanged to down $0.30 from Monday's close of $128.80.</p>
