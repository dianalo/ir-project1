<p>U.S. spot fuel oil prices were steady to up again Thursday in moderate activity, with a stifling heat wave still propping up New York Harbor values, while grades at the Gulf Coast held relatively steady.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumption on the East Coast is really moving, so prices should get stronger near-term,&quot; said one East Coast trader, noting power demand today hit a record again in New England and was at near-record levels all along the East Coast.</p>
<p>With oil units cranking this week to meet the unexpected surge in demand, most agreed utilities would soon be forced back into the market to replenish supplies.</p>
<p>While cooler East Coast temperatures are expected for the weekend, a return to slightly above-normal weather was forecast for early next week.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent edged 15 cents higher to the low-$17 a barrel area, with August one percent paper up a quarter to $16.75-17.00 with firmer crude.</p>
<p>There was no word on a New York utility tender for two cargoes of one percent for delivery by 7/30-8/4 and 8/6-10. NYH 0.3 percent high pour also was up slightly to $18.00-25 on prospects for better utility demand after the recent heat wave.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York also were modestly higher, with 2.2 percent now talked at $15.25-50.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, prices were stable, with one percent still in the low-$16s and three percent at $14.50-75.</p>
<p>No NYH or USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas Thursday again firmed a couple of cents to about the $2.60/mmBtu level, or $16.38 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, jumped five cents to $2.28/mmBtu, or $14.36 a barrel, on storm hype in the U.S. Gulf.</p>
