<p>Kingfisher Plc shares rocketed 6.7 percent on Thursday, leading a rally in retail stocks after the Bank of England raised rates by just a quarter percentage point after a meeting of its monetary policy committee.</p>
<p>Extending early gains on the back of positive comment on Wednesday's figures from rival Dixons Group Plc, Kingfisher shares were up 46-1/2p at 739 (corrects price from 439) by 1134 GMT and other leading UK retailers also rose sharply.  </p>
<p>With the sector also boosted by an upbeat trading statement from Storehouse Plc, there was renewed interest across the board in a sector that has underperformed the rest of the UK equity market in recent months.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of relief around in the retail sector,&quot; said one head of equity trading. &quot;They were given a real hammering and now everyone is just very happy.&quot;</p>
<p>With prices squeezed higher by a shortage of stock among market-makers after recent gains, blue chip retailer Marks &amp; Spencer Plc was up 24p at 558-1/2 and Great Universal Stores Plc was up 13p at 627-1/2.</p>
<p>Catalogue retailer Argos Plc was up 19-1/2p at 585, drugstore chain Boots Co Plc gained 37p to 819 and Storehouse leapt 13p to 201.</p>
<p>Dixons Group Plc was up 27-1/2p at 564.</p>
<p>Earlier the Bank of England said it raised its base lending rate by a quarter point to 6.75 percent, in line with expectations and dousing fears of a possible half-point increase that could have dented consumer confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will like this a damn sight more than 50 basis points, maybe there will be some relief for... retailers,&quot; said Andy Hartwill, strategist at SocGen.</p>
