<text>
<p>An afternoon of quiet range-trading left U.S. interest rate futures barely mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow, slow, slower,&quot; said one broker of closing trade.</p>
<p>Traders said the long end in particular stayed tethered to close, familiar ranges that some said could bind prices for the next couple of sessions as that market continues to chew through Friday's upside reversal.</p>
<p>Technically, some chartists said June Treasury bond futures appeared slightly skewed to the upside still, given that the contract heading into Friday's session was deeply oversold and due for a corrective bounce.  </p>
<p>They said Friday's spike lower, turnaround and higher close helped work off some of the downside overextension.</p>
<p>&quot;We had been pretty sold out for a couple days before that, so it was a good excuse to cover some shorts,&quot; said another floor broker of Friday's price behavior.</p>
<p>But they also noted sentiment that not all shorts have bailed out, with some viewing Friday's rebound as a fleeting event in a market that soon could retest lower levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally after a spike, we retest that low or high,&quot; the second broker added, noting that he looked for any rally toward 110-24/32 to entice sellers.  </p>
<p>June T-bonds Monday briefly probed below key psychological support pegged at 110-00 on selling of about 500 contracts from each of two houses, brokers said.</p>
<p>But local buying relieved the pressure and helped tug prices back upward just after midday, about the time the Federal Reserve set a coupon pass that also added support.</p>
<p>On the upside, June T-bonds futures stalled early at resistance at spanning 110-13/32 to 14/32, the latter also Friday's peak.</p>
<p>It stayed well shy of resistance various chartists pencilled in as spanning the 110-20/32 to 110-26/32 zone.  </p>
<p>After Friday's news that upward wage pressures remained controlled in February, traders will closely scrutinize the Federal Reserve's Beige Book of economic activity Wednesday for confirmation that price inflation remained tame.</p>
<p>The government will release February U.S. retail sales figures Thursday and producer price data Friday.</p>
<p>At settlement, June T-bonds ended up 1/32 at 110-04/32, T-notes ended flat at 107-19/32, muni-bonds ended down 8/32 at 113-30/32, June T-bills lost 0.005 basis point to 94.745, and Eurodollars lost 0.01 basis point to 94.190. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com))</p>
