<title>USA: Soros has no objection on Buntrock at WMX.</title>

<p>Financier George Soros, whose pressure helped force Phillip Rooney to resign as chief executive officer at WMX Technologies Inc earlier this week, said he has no objection to WMX Chairman Dean Buntrock remaining in his post.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Board of WMX is appropriately strengthened, Soros Fund Management has no objection to Mr. Buntrock's continuing his position of Chiarman of the WMX Board,&quot; a principal for Soros' investment fund said in a statement released Thursday.</p>
<p>Nell Minow, a principal at Lens Inc, a major WMX stockholder, told Reuters yesterday that Buntrock should stay on the job long enough to find a replacement for Rooney and then step down.</p>
<p>Buntrock founded the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company and was chief executive from 1968 until June 1996, when Rooney moved into the post after serving as chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Soros, Lens and other WMX shareholders have been pressuring the company to address its sagging stock price.</p>
<p>WMX announced a major restructuring earlier this month that has done little to silence its critics.</p>
<p>WMX shares were trading down 3/8 Thursday at 33-3/4.</p>
