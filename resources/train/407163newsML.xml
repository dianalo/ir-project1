<p>Russia's second biggest insurance company SAO Ingosstrakh said on Thursday it was willing to take over cover of Russian companies by troubled Russian insurance firms to fend off foreign penetration of the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;Ingosstrakh is ready to discuss with insured companies the possibility of freely taking over liabilities on current insurance policies issued by companies whose licences have been withdrawn, which face financial difficulties or which are unable to redeem their liabilities due to other reasons,&quot; Ingosstrakh President Vladimir Kruglyak told a new conference.</p>
<p>The condition for Ingosstrakh taking over other companies' liabilities would be a one-year contract with Ingosstrakh when a contract with another company expires, he said.</p>
<p>Ingosstrakh will not redeem liabilities on insurance cases which have already happened and will only deal with property insurance contracts, he said.</p>
<p>The Russian insurance industry is undergoing difficult times.</p>
<p>1996 was the first year since 1992 when overall insurance premiums fell in real terms.</p>
<p>The number of companies shrank to about 2,500 from 2,800 at the start of the year and the government expects it to be even lower after companies file their annual reports by April 1.</p>
<p>Both companies and the government anticipate 1999 with some trepidation because that will be the year when foreign companies are allowed to come to the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very much interested in stopping the trend, to prevent an outflow of funds and foreign firms being more popular,&quot; Ingosstrakh first vice-president Yuri Belov said.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies registered in Russia must be insured by Russian companies as they can provide as good insurance service as foreign ones.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament has passed a law in a first reading forbidding companies registered in Russia from being insured by foreign firms.</p>
<p>Ingosstrakh will launch its new programme on March 1 in the Moscow region and plans to expand it to the whole of Russia, Kruglyak said.</p>
