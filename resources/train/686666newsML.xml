<p>India on Wednesday restaked a claim over divided Kashmir and said it wanted talks with Islamabad to focus on Pakistan's military &quot;occupation&quot; of part of the region, the cause of two wars between the neighbours.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Salman Haider said New Delhi expected talks over Kashmir to focus on Pakistan's support for militancy in the Indian-controlled section of the Himalayan region and not on the legitimacy of Indian rule.</p>
<p>The diplomat, who led the Indian delegation at a round of talks in Islamabad that ended on Monday, denied India had made a landmark concession by agreeing to put Kashmir on an agenda for future talks.</p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Monday it was the first time India had recognised Kashmir as disputed. &quot;It is a major breakthrough in Indo-Pakistan relations,&quot; Sharif said.</p>
<p>But Haider, who is India's highest-ranking career diplomat, gave a sharply different version which analysts said underscored the deep split that continues to divide the South Asian nations nearly 50 years after they won their independence.</p>
<p>&quot;We have discussed Kashmir, in fact on a number of occasions, and we have also historically taken the position that we do not shy away from discussing Kashmir,&quot; Haider told a news conference after returning from Pakistan.</p>
<p>Both Pakistan and India claim the right to rule over Jammu and Kashmir, which has sparked two of the three wars between the two countries.</p>
<p>Pakistan has controlled one third of the region since 1947. Islamabad calls the area under its rule Azad (Free) Kashmir, while India calls it Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK).</p>
<p>The remaining two thirds lie within India's Jammu and Kashmir state, where more than 20,000 people have died in violence since a separatist rebellion erupted in 1990. Pakistan denies that it arms and trains guerrillas.</p>
<p>Haider said there were numerous issues to be discussed relating to Jammu and Kashmir at the talks, which are scheduled to resume in September at the foreign secretary level.</p>
<p>&quot;When we talk about the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, there is a juridical element in that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We make the point that parts of Jammu and Kashmir are under Pakistani occupation by military force, and that is something that we would certainly discuss.&quot;</p>
<p>Haider was asked to comment on whether India, which has long maintained that Pakistan has no rightful claim to any of Jammu and Kashmir, had offered a concession by acknowledging that Kashmir is disputed.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said that there is no dispute in our part of Kashmir, but there are issues relating to POK,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>&quot;We also have other concerns, and these concerns relate to infiltration, support for terrorism, and these are also issues relating to Jammu and Kashmir which we believe need to be addressed,&quot; Haider said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our part of Kashmir is going to be discussed, I trust, in the sense that it is subject to infiltration and to support for terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if India expected the area of Jammu and Kashmir currently under Delhi's control to be discussed as a disputed area, Haider said: &quot;Not in that sense, no.&quot;</p>
