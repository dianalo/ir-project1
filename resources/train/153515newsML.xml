<p>Britain's world land speed record challenger, the jet-powered Thrust SSC, will have to wait another week before its first trial in the deserts of southern Jordan, organisers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the 9.5 tonne car, powered by two jet engines from a Phantom warplane, needed spare parts from Britain. It would not start racing on the al-Jafr mudflats before next Wednesday.</p>
<p>The car had been scheduled to start trials this week for an assault on the world land speed record of 633.47 (1,019.44 kph) set by Briton Richard Noble in 1983.</p>
<p>Noble, project director for the Thrust team in Jordan, said he hoped next month's trials would set the stage for a 1997 attempt to break the sound barrier -- about 750 mph (1200 kph).</p>
<p>&quot;They ran the engines at full power and discovered a fuel problem that had not cropped up before,&quot; Andrew Noble, Richard's younger brother, told Reuters by telephone from the military airbase 200 km (125 miles) south of Amman where the car is being prepared for the desert run.</p>
<p>&quot;It just needs a couple of valves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Noble said the team had not been affected by news that its main rival, American Craig Breedlove, had been forced to call off his own record bid for this year after he damaged his jet-powered car when it tilted and spun around at 675 miles per hour (1,086 kph).</p>
<p>To set a new mark, cars must travel at record speed over one mile (1.6 km) twice in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&quot;We were horrified to hear of the accident. Thank God he's O.K.,&quot; said Noble. &quot;But we couldn't be keener to set our own record here in Jordan.&quot;</p>
