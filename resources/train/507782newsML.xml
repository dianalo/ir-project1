<p>Strike action forced TAT and Air Liberte, French units of British Airways, to cancel about half their flights on Monday, a spokesman for the airlines said.</p>
<p>TAT saw 65 percent of its schedule cancelled and Air Liberte grounded 50 percent of its flights as cockpit crews at the airlines protested over pay and conditions they say will be damaged by a merger of the two airlines.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the companies said the level of disruption, in its sixth day, was about the same as over the weekend while a union official said that only 10 or 12 of 180 scheduled flights were guaranteed on Monday.</p>
<p>Striking junior hospital doctors, ending their fifth week of a strike against goverment plans to cap health spending, vowed to keep up their protests and demanded wide-ranging negotiations with the government.</p>
<p>About 35 doctors charged past guards at the National Assembly on Monday and hung a banner on the building. &quot;(Health Minister Jacques) Barrot, you're lying to social security recipients,&quot; the banner read.</p>
<p>Police kicked and struck with truncheons several members of a group of about 300 protesters outside the lower house of parliament. The 300 protesters were being held by authorities after the incident, police said.</p>
<p>Another group of about 50 doctors staged a sit-in in front of the presidential Elysee Palace but were soon dispersed by police.</p>
<p>The strikers want the government to delay or scrap plans to fine doctors if the region in which they work overshoots pre-set spending limits, regardless of individual practice.</p>
