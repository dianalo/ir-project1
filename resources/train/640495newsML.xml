<headline>French Socialists elect parliament leader.</headline>

<p>France's Socialist party deputies on Tuesday chose Jean-Marc Ayrault, the mayor of the western city of Nantes, as their floor leader in the National Assembly after the left swept to power in Sunday's election.</p>
<p>Ayrault, a fluent German speaker, succeeds former prime minister Laurent Fabius in the post. Fabius is set to become speaker of the 577-member Assembly where the Socialists won the largest bloc of 243 seats.</p>
<p>The only candidate for floor leader, 47-year-old Ayrault, was chosen by acclamation by Socialist deputies. He has been a National Assembly member since 1986 and mayor of Nantes since 1989.</p>
<p>Ayrault, who has a degree enabling him to teach German, said the Socialists should seek to be &quot;determined, aggressive and at the same time remain close to the grassroots.&quot;</p>
<p>He has been a member of the Socialist party leadership since 1977 and has recently become a close ally of new Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</p>
