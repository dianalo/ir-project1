<p>Swiss and EU negotiators ended their latest round of drawn-out efforts to set rules governing heavy lorry traffic through the Alps on Wednesday, leaving several issues unresolved but vowing to continue their efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position largely coincides with that of the European Union although two material differences remain,&quot; Switzerland's lead negotiator Max Friedli told a news conference.</p>
<p>Friedli, director of Switzerland's Federal Office for Transportation, said remaining differences concerned how much EU trucks should pay to transit his country and the bloc's demand for immediate access for its 40-tonne lorries to Switzerland's industrial and commercial centres.</p>
<p>The EU's transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said that while there had been progress and useful clarification at the meeting, he was concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned by the results of this negotiation session with the Swiss authorities on the vital land transport chapter of the proposed agreement,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been some progress and useful clarification at this session. However, I must emphasise strongly that such an agreement cannot be reached if the present ban on 40-tonne trucks crossing Switzerland is replaced by a prohibitive level of charging over Swiss routes.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinnock said that prohibitive charges on Swiss roads would perpetuate a massive diversion of traffic through Austria and France.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot regard any proposals that have these implications as an acceptable contribution to a satisfactory outcome.&quot;</p>
<p>Berne has offered a stepped phase-out of its existing ban on lorries weighing more than 28 tonnes until 2005, when a road-pricing system would replace the ban on heavier vehicles.</p>
<p>Friedli said Switzerland had offered a 600-Swiss-franc ($420) charge as the &quot;basis for discussion&quot;, comprising a 200 franc transit charge plus a three-centime-per-tonne-kilometre charge per lorry.</p>
<p>He said an alternative rail option for freight carriage through Switzerland should prove cheaper than the 600-franc charge being negotiated.</p>
<p>The European Union wants a fee comparable to the costs of using the Mont Blanc tunnel between Italy and France or the Brenner pass between Austria and Italy.</p>
<p>In a linked issue, Switzerland also wants greater access to EU airports for its air carriers, a demand which has done little to ignite EU enthusiasm so far.</p>
<p>The European Commission, which conducts talks on behalf of EU member states, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
