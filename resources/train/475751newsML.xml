<p>Israel, embroiled in daily street battles with Palestinians, now faces a bigger challenge to Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem -- an Arab League call for its members to suspend steps toward normal relations with it.</p>
<p>Stone-throwing Palestinians clashed with Israeli soldiers on Sunday in the West Bank for the 11th day since Israel broke ground this month on a new Jewish settlement at a hilltop called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic or Har Homa in Hebrew.</p>
<p>Israel's High Court approved the army demolition of the West Bank home of an Islamist suicide bomber who killed himself and three Israelis in Tel Aviv on March 21.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources said demolition of the house could take place within 24 hours, a move that could fuel clashes.</p>
<p>The settlement building and suicide bombing have plunged Israel-Palestinian relations to one of their lowest points since a 1993 interim peace deal.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday again accused the Palestinian Authority of encouraging terrorism in an interview with CBS television. The Authority denies the charge.</p>
<p>Israeli soldiers on Sunday shot and wounded one Palestinian with live ammunition and wounded at least 37 others with rubber bullets, Palestinian hospital officials said. The army said one soldier was slightly wounded by a stone as was an Israeli woman.</p>
<p>Police in Jerusalem said there were several stone-throwing incidents in the city. Three Israelis were injured when a bus was stoned. They said in another incident two policemen were injured. Three Palestinians were arrested for throwing stones.</p>
<p>The incidents were not as bad as Israel had feared they would be after one Palestinian was killed on Saturday in clashes with troops, the first fatality in the unrest. It had also worried that Land Day, an annual day of protests by Israeli Arabs against land confiscation, might bring a surge in violence.</p>
<p>Police said 25 Israeli Arabs were arrested for stone- throwing in scattered incidents but that Land Day mass rallies were peaceful.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the majority of the Palestinian forces, policemen, were working with us against the violence in the area,&quot; Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said of the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Israeli Arabs and their leaders deserve full credit,&quot; Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani separately told reporters. &quot;They behaved like mature citizens of Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>But the congratulatory mood was soon dispelled by the Arab League's decision late on Sunday recommending member countries suspend steps toward relations with Israel and reactivate the Arab boycott over the new settlement.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, speaking to CBS before the decision was taken, said he doubted Arab states would cut ties because &quot;it would cost them as much as it would cost us&quot;.</p>
<p>After the decision, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor told Reuters:</p>
<p>&quot;Normal neighbourly relations and regional co-operation are supposed to be an asset and a common interest for all countries in this region.</p>
<p>&quot;It is absurd that they are being deemed as a whip, so to speak, to be used against Israel whenever there is a crisis in the peace process.&quot;</p>
