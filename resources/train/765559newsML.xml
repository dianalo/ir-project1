<headline>TENNIS-HUBER, PIERCE STRUGGLE AND VENUS ROMPS AT CARLSBAD.</headline>
<dateline>CARLSBAD, California 1997-07-30</dateline>

<p>Anke Huber and Mary Pierce both survived stiff challenges to post three-set victories Tuesday and advance to the second round of the $450,000 Toshiba Classic women's tennis tournament.</p>
<p>Fifth seed Huber of Germany beat Bulgarian Magdalena Maleeva 7-5 1-6 6-3, while France's sixth-seeded Pierce overcame American Amy Frazier 6-3 6-7 (6-8) 6-3.</p>
<p>In contrast, promising American Venus Williams drubbed Argentine Florencia Labat 6-3 6-2 to set up a teenage showdown against world number one Martina Hingis.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old Williams, ranked 64th but heralded as one of the next great American women's players, downplayed Wednesday's match against the 16-year-old Swiss phenom.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nothing special, just another match,&quot; said Williams, who chose to go through qualifying rather than accept a wildcard, and posted three wins to earn her way into the draw.</p>
<p>&quot;You still have to go out there and beat the player in the next round.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis has a 50-1 mark this year with eight tournament victories, including Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Huber advanced despite losing serve eight times and committing 11 double faults in the one hour, 50-minute struggle against Maleeva, who also lost serve eight times.</p>
<p>&quot;Serving is not the strongest part of our game,&quot; Huber said. &quot;We're both returning better than we're serving.</p>
<p>&quot;I was little bit lucky in the first set. I slept in the second, and I was just fighting in the third. In the end, I was a little bit better than her.&quot;</p>
<p>Huber sandwiched breaks in the fourth and six games around one of her own for a 4-2 advantage in the deciding set. At 4-3, the German converted her fifth break point to go ahead 5-3 before serving out the match at love.</p>
<p>Pierce was pleased with her victory.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a great match for me, she really made me play,&quot; the 10th-ranked Pierce said after the 2:20 baseline duel.</p>
<p>Pierce got the only break she needed in the second game of the final set when Frazier committed one of her six double faults of the match on game point.</p>
<p>About the only thing Williams lost during her romp over Labat was a battle with her beads when about 20 purple, green and white ones fell off her corn-rowed head late in the second set.</p>
<p>Despite Williams's slow start as a professional and Hingis's meteoric rise to the top, the upcoming match could offer a glimpse into a future rivalry. Williams lost the only match she has played against Hingis, 6-4 6-2 in the third round of this year's Lipton Championships.</p>
<p>Asked what she might have learned from the initial encounter, Williams declined to answer, saying only, &quot;it's old and boring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing when you go out is to play the game, not the name,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot of people go out there and think they're gonna lose. When I go out there, I don't want my opponent to get a point. Every point is very important to me.&quot;</p>
