<p>New York State Attorney-General Dennis Vacco, who argued before the U.S. Supreme Court last month against lifting the state's ban on physician-assisted suicide, announced Monday the establishment of a commission on pain management for the dying.</p>
<p>Opponents of the commission say pain is not the main issue and that officials need to study issues such as incontinence, nausea, diarrhoea, hallucinations and other illnesses that bring into question whether someone who is terminally ill is dying with dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;Modern medicine can and must do more to treat and ease the pain of those suffering with terminal illness,&quot; Vacco said in a speech to the New York State Conservative Conference. &quot;The challenge to this commission is to identify obstacles to adequate pain care and to find ways to ensure that all patients receive the pain-relief they deserve in their dying days.&quot;</p>
<p>Vacco said the &quot;End-of-Life Care Commission&quot; would be composed of physicians from all over the United States who specialise in cancer, AIDS and geriatric care. Officials from hospitals, hospices and nursing homes would also participate.</p>
<p>Bill Batt, president of the pro-euthenasia New York State Hemlock Society, said the commission &quot;is assuming pain is the main issue, but it isn't. If I had Alzheimer's, I'd rather be dead than walking around like a zombie.&quot;</p>
<p>No state has allowed physician-assisted suicide or legalised the practice but it has been held up in court, most notably in the case of Dr. Jack Kevorkian of Michigan. The 68-year-old retired pathologist has attended 45 known suicides since 1990. Kevorkian has been acquitted in three trials since 1994.</p>
<p>Vacco said the commission would study whether doctors are using adequate amounts of heavily regulated painkillers such as morphine and other prescription medications, including valium. The drugs are regulated because they are addictive.</p>
<p>It would also look into the ways hospitals measure and record pain levels in patients, what priority is given to relieve pain for patients and medical training for pain management.</p>
