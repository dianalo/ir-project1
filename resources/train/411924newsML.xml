<p>Wascana Energy Inc, target of a C$1.7-billion takeover bid from Talisman Energy Inc, on Thursday reported record results for 1996 and suggested it was not about to go down without a fight.</p>
<p>&quot;Wascana successfully produced record cash flow, earnings and oil volumes in 1996,&quot; Wascana chief executive officer Frank Proto said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The results announced today confirm that Wascana has turned around, and that the best years for shareholders lie ahead as we build on our 1996 success,&quot; Proto said.  </p>
<p>Regina, Saskatchewan-based Wascana said its earnings last year grew to C$35 million, or C$0.43 a share, compared to restated earnings in 1995 of C$600,000 or C$0.01 a share.</p>
<p>Cash flow was C$215 million or C$2.61 a share in 1996, up from C$191 million or C$2.36 a share the year before.</p>
<p>Crude oil production averaged 51,400 barrels a day in 1996 and natural gas output reached 200 million cubic feet per day.</p>
<p>Wascana announced its year-end results on the same day as Talisman, which also reported a record financial and operating performance for the year.  </p>
<p>Calgary-based Talisman plans to offer C$18.50 cash or 0.41 of a Talisman share for each share of Wascana, a former Saskatchewan government-owned company known for heavy oil production and reserves.</p>
<p>Talisman has yet to mail its offer document for the deal, which would be the largest transaction in Canada's energy sector in three years.</p>
<p>But Wascana's future growth plans -- including increased capital spending for the year -- suggested the company was not about roll over.  </p>
<p>&quot;I look forward to the coming debate about the dynamic future of Wascana Energy and I am optimistic that we will, through the process, ensure the optimal result for our shareholders,&quot; Proto said.</p>
<p>Wascana said its board of directors would review the bid and make a recommendation to shareholders after the circular was received from Talisman.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't got an offer yet, so this company continues to move forward,&quot; Wascana spokesman Tim Jeffery said in a telephone interview from Regina.</p>
