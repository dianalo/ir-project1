<p>The dollar floated higher on Friday but failed to make a significant comeback from Thursday's sharp slide, thereby calling into question the sustainability of the dollar's recent climb, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people are long- or medium-term still dollar bulls, but I am hearing more and more disappointment in the inability of the dollar to move higher,&quot; said Robert Fullem, an assistant vice-president at NatWest Markets in New York.  </p>
<p>The dollar has risen more than 10 percent against the German mark and almost eight percent versus the Japanese yen since the beginning of this year. However, the dollar's shine was tarnished this week by signs of embryonic growth in Europe and Japan and repeated calls from German officials for an end to the U.S. unit's spirited rally.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.6891/96 marks from 1.6840/50 at Friday's open and 123.20/30 yen from 122.45/55.</p>
<p>Aiding the dollar on Friday was weakness in the Japanese yen, reflecting market concern over China's President Jiang Zemin's ability to hold on to power.  </p>
<p>Speaking publicly for the first time since the death of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang vowed on Friday to push forward reforms that his mentor launched 18 years ago. Some diplomats said Jiang may soon be embroiled in a power struggle with other contenders in the highest echelons of the ruling Communist party.</p>
<p>The dollar briefly dipped against the mark following a remark by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which mimicked an oft-stated refrain of German central bankers, that the mark has &quot;fully corrected against the dollar in the last year.&quot;  </p>
<p>The unity in opposition to a stronger dollar between the German government and Bundesbank briefly weighed on the dollar. However, Kohl's comments were soon discounted.</p>
<p>&quot;The knee-jerk reaction was to sell dollars and buy marks, but people soon came to the conclusion that Kohl really has no function as far as determining the level of the mark,&quot; said Bob Houck, a vice-president and trader at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Comments from Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke and vice-chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Alice Rivlin caught the market's attention, but had little impact on dollar trade.  </p>
<p>Welteke said Germany was unlikely to meet the budget deficit target required for entry into the union for a single European currency. Nevertheless, he added that Germany would participate at the proposed 1999 currency launch date.</p>
<p>Rivlin said a strong dollar &quot;certainly helps&quot; curb inflation, but could hurt U.S. exporters.</p>
<p>In late U.S. trade, dollar traders took little notice when U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin reaffirmed his familiar stance that a &quot;strong dollar is in the United States' interest and it has been strong for some time now.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Rubin comment was in a statement released along with a semi-annual Treasury report of foreign exchange prepared for Congress.</p>
<p>Wall Street stocks held their ground after Thursday's precipitous fall, comforting foreign exchange traders, who feared another day of heavy losses.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar rose to 1.4710/20 Swiss francs from 1.4772/82 and rose to Canadian $1.3641/46 from C$1.3595/00. The British pound fell to $1.6180/90 from $1.6187/97.</p>
