<headline>Freeport chief hopes report will shed light on Busang.</headline>

<p>Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. Chairman Jim Bob Moffett said Tuesday he hoped the mystery about the size of gold deposits at a site in Indonesia once thought to be the find of the century would be cleared up by a key report that is expected next Monday.</p>
<p>Moffett told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that results from independent tests now underway would likely determine whether Freeport will participate with Bre-X Minerals Ltd. in the development of the Busang project.</p>
<p>&quot;Freeport's participation is predicated on the fact that we will go forward and join only if we can confirm an economic deposit,&quot; Moffett said.</p>
<p>Bre-X, based in Canada, once hailed Busang as one of the world's richest gold deposits with an estimated 71 million ounces of the precious metal, but those numbers have come under question since Freeport's own tests showed insignificant amounts of gold.</p>
<p>Bre-X, whose stock took a spectacular tumble after Freeport reported its test results on March 26, has hired Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. to do its own independent tests. &quot;We're hoping that this new Strathcona drilling will add more light,&quot; Moffett said.</p>
<p>Bre-X Minerals said on Tuesday that it now expected to release the Strathcona interim report Monday. There was market speculation that Bre-X might publish the report after receiving it later this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Bre-X expects to release the interim report next Monday morning prior to the opening of financial markets in North America,&quot; Bre-X spokesman Richard Wool said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>North American financial markets generally open at 0930 EDT/1330 GMT.</p>
<p>While all eyes are on tiny Toronto-based Strathcona, some analysts said its report may only lead to further drilling at the Busang site.</p>
<p>&quot;For anything definitive, one would expect a due diligence process that would take more than just six holes drilled by Strathcona and the seven holes (by Freeport). A lot more will have to be done before one has an idea of what is there and what isn't there,&quot; said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada Inc.</p>
<p>Freeport has an agreement with Bre-X to take a 15 percent stake in the Busang project if its so-called due diligence reviews turn up enough gold to mine. Freeport would pay up to $400 million to delineate reserves and build a mining complex to exploit reserves once estimated at $25 billion based on current gold prices.</p>
<p>The stakes are not insignificant for Freeport, which would see $1 billion added to its market value if in fact big gold deposits are present, said PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen.</p>
<p>The New Orleans-based company already has extensive operations in Indonesia where its Grasberg mine contains the world's largest proven gold reserve and third-largest copper reserve.</p>
<p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against Bre-X alleging that the company inflated Busang's alleged reserves to boost Bre-X stock. Bre-X officials have denied the charges.</p>
<p>Freeport stock closed unchanged at $29.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Bre-X closed up C15 (11) cents at C$3.80 ($2.70) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
