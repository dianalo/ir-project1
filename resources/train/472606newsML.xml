<p>Pakistani police on Thursday killed six foreign Moslem &quot;holy warriors&quot; who held out for five days in an Afghan refugee camp near the northwestern town of Peshawar, police officials said.</p>
<p>They said they believed two Egyptians were among those killed in the battle after the police stormed a compound at the large Jallozai camp, where the radicals holed up after killing a differing comrade-in-arms and an Afghan boy.</p>
<p>Some of them were Algerians and probably two were Tajiks, the officials said. They could not immediately specify the nationalities of all the group members, who also shot dead a police constable on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pakistani officials said most were veterans of the Afghan guerrilla war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s and belonged to the shadowy Takfiri group, which regards Moslems under U.S. influence as infidels and liable to be put to death.</p>
<p>The Takfiris had fled to Afghanistan after Pakistani authorities launched a hunt for them in a border tribal region in April 1993 but returned after the Taleban Islamic militia took control of eastern Afghan provinces bordering Pakistan.</p>
<p>The standoff at the Jallozai camp, in the North West Frontier Province of which Peshawar is the capital, began when the group killed an Algerian fellow member, Mustapha Algazairee, after he refused to join their &quot;jihad&quot; (holy war) and decided to surrender to authorities, the offiicials said.</p>
<p>An Afghan refugee boy was killed by a stray bullet. Three other Egyptians dropped out of the group and surrendered, camp sources said.</p>
<p>The incident coincided with a one-day Islamic summit conference on Sunday in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, which was also attended by leaders from pro-Western Arab countries.</p>
<p>Police officials they were investigating whether the group had any plans to disrupt the Islamabad summit.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one theory we are working on,&quot; provincial police chief Kamal Shah told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the police fired rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns in the battle and used bulldozers to raze a cluster of brick houses under which the guerrillas had dug tunnels.</p>
<p>&quot;They were well trained, motivated and had good fire control,&quot; he said of the radicals, who were also armed with machineguns and grenades.</p>
<p>&quot;We gave them enough time to surrender,&quot; said Shah, whose force began its operation on Wednesday after the camp's Afghan guards failed to subdue the guerrillas. &quot;But they were ready to die.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jallozai camp is controlled by the Ittehad-i-Islami group of Afghan leader Abdurrab Rasul Sayyaf, who is regarded as close to Saudi Arabia.</p>
