<headline>Battered Bund futures seen remaining weak.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>German DTB Bund futures continued their relentless slide on Thursday with analysts largely foxed by the swift sell-off.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices lacked significant upward momentum during the Tuesday morning rally but then sold off sharply for no particular reason in the afternoon,&quot; analysts at DMG futures and options in Frankfurt said of Thursday's trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Lingering fiscal and credibility concerns are probably rsponsible.&quot;</p>
<p>By 0630 GMT, the June DTB contract was 12 basis points down at 101.05, having hit an earlier low of 100.98.  </p>
<p>The June contract gapped down at the open, leaving Wednesday's 101.12 behind and starting the new session at 101.00. Weakness was centred mainly in futures.</p>
<p>Talk of large institutional selling of German assets pervaded the market on Wednesday, and traders said one large U.S. house had switched to sell.</p>
<p>Analysts said government squabbling over plans to plug the expected 1997 deficit hole was giving both international and domestic investors an uncomfortable feeling about the German market, since as yet no clear strategy has emerged of how the gap will be filled.  </p>
<p>&quot;Finally the market gave up,&quot; said Norman Beauchamp, head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London. &quot;And when it did, we got the sell-off all in one go.&quot;</p>
<p>But while he said Wednesday's slide was swift, he expected Bund futures to regain some dignity this session and limit their losses to just above 100.80, where a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent upmove kicks in.</p>
<p>&quot;It should find some pretty good support around that area. That is where I'd be looking for the market to find its lows today,&quot; Beauchamp said.  </p>
<p>On the data front, Bunds face the April Ifo survey at 0800 GMT and are expecting to see April M3 data sometime in the next few sessions.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Ifo index, which measures buiness sentiment, was likely to have more impact since M3 data is unlikely to change the steady interest rate outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;On the back of recent orders data one cold expect a sharp rebound (in the Ifo),&quot; one analyst said. &quot;However, tax talks between the SPD and the government broke down at the end of April, which could have dampened sentiment significantly.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the cash market, which was holding up reasonably well in the face of futures weakness, the 10-year benchmark Bund was trading at 100.77 and offering a 5.890 percent bid yield by 0655 GMT.</p>
<p>The 10-year yield gap to Treasuries was at 96 basis points with the U.S. market far outpacing Bunds on performance.</p>
