<p>*NB - The survey estimate is derived by omitting the high and low forecast and averaging the rest, with a sample of at least six.</p>
<p>Gasoline inventories are expected to show a bullish decline in Tuesday evening's oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) as Fourth of July holiday drivers guzzled up supply and imports tapered off, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline demand continues to be robust, estimated at approximately two to 2.5 percent annualized growth. Since Memorial Day, the symbolic start of the driving season, it has been 1.9 percent,&quot; said Thomas Blakeslee, analyst and trader with Cargill Investor Services Inc in New York.</p>
<p>Gasoline stocks were seen declining one to three million barrels.</p>
<p>&quot;There may have been some replacement needed on the secondary level after all the driving during the Fourth of July,&quot; said a New York gasoline trader, noting inventories may have been drained on the refinery level to replenish supplies at gasoline stations.</p>
<p>The inventory data reflects the week ended July 11.</p>
<p>Dealers said gasoline imports should decline after swelling to 568,000 barrels per day (bpd) in last week's data. Also, a tighter arbitrage several weeks ago from Europe to the U.S. was supposed to have moderated the pace of cargoes.</p>
<p>Crude imports had ballooned to nine million bpd in last week's API data, and traders were expecting a downward correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports should come down in crude, although it won't be a huge decline,&quot; said William Brown, president of trading firm W.H. Brown &amp; Co in New York.</p>
<p>Dealers expected crude stocks to decline by 1.5 to 2.5 million barrels, as high refinery utilization rates also ate into supply. The refinery rate was expected to stay steady with the 95.6 percent level reported last week.  </p>
<p>Distillate stocks, comprised of heating oil and diesel, were expected to show a seasonal build of one to three million barrels. Refiners usually build heating oil stocks in the summer in anticipation of winter demand.</p>
