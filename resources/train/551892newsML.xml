<p>Occidental Petroleum Corp's president acknowledged the company boosted revenue through money-losing crude oil trading partly in order to make its oil and natural gas operations look larger, the Wall Street Journal said in Wednesday's electronic edition.</p>
<p>According to Occidental's annual report, the company's crude-oil trading totaled about $1 billion in 1995 and 1996 and about $800 million in 1994, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>This equalled about one-third of Occidental's oil and natural gas revenues and was included in reported sales, the Journal said.</p>
<p>Occidental President and Senior Operating Officer Dale Laurence was quoted in the paper as saying in an interview part of the company's aim was to make &quot;our oil and (natural) gas businesses appear to be a larger entity,&quot; as well as helping the company understand commodity market conditions.</p>
<p>The Journal said Laurence acknowledged trades were partly meant to help Occidental deal with other companies in the industry by improving &quot;the overall cosmetics of the company.&quot;</p>
<p>The paper said one internal memo indicated from 1990 to 1993, Occidental incurred nearly $10 million in total losses from what the document called &quot;speculative&quot; crude trades.</p>
<p>Occidental spokesmen were quoted as saying looses since 1993 were much lower.</p>
<p>According to internal documents and company officials, the trading made Occidental's petroleum operations look more robust in both good and less prosperous times, the paper said.</p>
<p>Officials were also quoted as saying they thought the trading complied with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules.</p>
