<title>USA: Icahn buys into casino industry via Stratosphere.</title>

<text>
<p>Financier Carl Icahn, whose corporate takeovers range from airlines to comic books, is looking to buy his way into the high-stakes casino industry by acquiring the debt of bankrupt Stratosphere Corp.</p>
<p>A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late last week showed that two Icahn affiliates have acquired $81.8 million of Stratosphere's first mortgage notes, or about 40 percent of the $203 million currently outstanding.</p>
<p>In the filing, American Real Estate also outlined a proposed restructuring for Stratosphere under which the affiliates pledged to buy newly issued Stratosphere debt and equity.</p>
<p>Stratosphere opened a huge, $550 million resort in April 1996 with a great deal of fanfare and media hype. The property's centrepiece was a 1,149-foot tower -- touted as the largest structure west of the Mississippi River -- with a restaurant and rollercoaster planted firmly on top.</p>
<p>But management and facility problems, as well as a location on the Las Vegas &quot;Strip&quot; far from the main action, kept guests and gamblers away. By January, Stratosphere plummeted into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Since then, holders of the company's first mortgage notes and its controlling shareholder, Minnesota-based Grand Casinos Inc., have been negotiating over a company reorganization.</p>
<p>In late June, Stratosphere issued a revised restructuring plan that would give Grand Casinos 90 percent of the reorganized company and note holders 10 percent.</p>
<p>Stratosphere shares, which traded as high as $12.625 before the property's grand opening, are no longer listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>
<p>Last Friday, American Real Estate filed with the SEC to raise $300 million through an offering of rights to acquire depositary units in the company.</p>
<p>In its filing, American Real Estate said &quot;the types of investments (it) will pursue include...acquiring debt or equity securities of companies which may be undergoing restructuring&quot; among other targets.</p>
<p>It also outlined the investment in Stratosphere bonds and its proposed restructuring. Under their plan, the note holders could participate in a new, $200 million rights offering by Stratosphere to purchase new units consisting of new mortgage notes and common stock.</p>
<p>American Real Estate and the Icahn affiliate pledged to purchase their portion of the new issue and any units not purchased by the other noteholders.</p>
<p>Proceeds of the offer would be used to pay some of the company's creditors when the reorganization is completed. Also, note holders would be entitled to a pro rata portion of $100 million of the proceeds.</p>
<p>Executives at American Real Estate and Grand Casinos did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>Icahn is perhaps best known for his purchase of Trans World Airlines Inc. in the mid-1980s. After losing control of the company in 1992, Icahn said he lost money in the deal and called it &quot;the worst investment I've made in the last decade.</p>
<p>More recently, in June this year, Icahn used his position as a bondholder to gain control of bankrupt Marvel Entertainment Group Inc., a publisher of comic books with heroes like Spiderman and The Incredible Hulk.</p>
