<p>Skandia insurance company and Stadshypotek mortgage bank Monday proposed merging into what would become the Nordic region's biggest financial institution, but the plan was immediately denounced by Finance Minister Erik Asbrink.</p>
<p>The announcement by the two Swedish firms -- which followed a government statement that it would sell its 34 percent stake in Stadshypotek through an auction -- sparked an unusually harsh reaction from the normally reserved Asbrink.</p>
<p>Asbrink, angry that Stadshypotek had been negotiating with Skandia without consulting him as its largest shareholder, said that management of the country's biggest mortgage lender had strayed into areas reserved for shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no confidence in the present board of directors of Stadshypotek,&quot; Asbrink said in a statement. &quot;The Stadshypotek board's behaviour is contrary to what is customary practice in Swedish industry. I am very critical of how the board of directors of Stadshypotek has handled this question.&quot;</p>
<p>Asbrink said expressions of interest in the government's stake in the mortgage lender had come from Sweden and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this one is not over. This is not a done deal yet, considering the way it has been left open by the government,&quot; BZW analyst Angus Runciman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our feeling is that the government has clearly left the way open for a higher bid for Stadshypotek,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The proposed new group, to be called Skandia Stadshypotek, would have total assets of 500 billion crowns ($75.8 billion), net assets of 37.5 billion ($5.68 billion) and a total market capitalisation of about 45 billion ($6.8 billion).</p>
<p>Both companies said the government had not been willing to discuss the proposed merger.</p>
<p>They said the merger was expected to improve earnings per share in 1997, generate large cost savings and enhance returns through an expansion of international business.</p>
<p>&quot;We are convinced that the new company will increase value for shareholders in Skandia and Stadshypotek,&quot; Skandia Chief Executive Bjorn Wolrath said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are creating a strong and competitive Nordic financial services company which has the capital base required to meet the challenges of restructuring within the Nordic finance sector,&quot; Wolrath said.</p>
<p>The total synergies are estimated at 800 million crowns ($115 million) in 1998 and 1.2 billion in 1999, of which more than half comprises cost savings. Restructuring costs of 500 million crowns over the next three years were forecast.</p>
<p>Skandia Chairman Sven Soderberg said Skandia's offer was made in the firm belief that the state would carefully consider the proposal.</p>
<p>He said the government said the restrictions on the sale process as laid down by parliament were the reason the two companies had not been allowed to discuss the proposal with the major shareholder.</p>
