<p>The Coca-Cola Co. Tuesday unveiled a new aluminum can that mimics the shape of its famous contoured bottle.</p>
<p>The soft-drink giant said the long-awaited packaging innovation, which it hopes will distinguish its canned products from those of its rivals, will be test-marketed in five U.S. markets starting early next month.</p>
<p>The new can will be introduced for the Coca-Cola Classic brand in four Southwestern markets and in Terre Haute, Ind. -- where the contoured bottle first appeared in 1915.</p>
<p>&quot;The proprietary Coca-Cola contour bottle is one of the world's most powerful equities with consumers,&quot; Coca-Cola USA President Jack Stahl said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We view the introduction of the contour can as a learning opportunity to assess operational factors before we consider moving toward commercialization of the package. We want to see how the contour can actually works in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>Coca-Cola began testing a steel version of the contoured can in Germany in 1994 but had to develop new can-shaping capabilities before it could transfer the innovation to the aluminum cans used in the United States.</p>
<p>Coke introduced a 20-oz. contoured plastic bottle for Coca-Cola Classic three years ago and followed it up with a dimpled 20-oz. bottle for Sprite.</p>
<p>Company executives said the innovations consequently helped the company expand its share of the U.S. soft-drink market.</p>
<p>The company said the contoured can introductions would be supported by local television, print and outdoor advertising.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola's stock added 62.5 cents to $61.25 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
