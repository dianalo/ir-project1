<p>U.S. blue chips staged a furious rally on Tuesday, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average to the second largest advance in its history.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials surged 173 points to close unofficially at 6834, a rally second in point terms only to the 186.84 point rebound that occurred two days after the Black Monday stock market crash of October, 1987.</p>
<p>With the gains, the Dow has now recovered more than 440 points or better than 60 percent of the nearly 700 points it surrendered between March 11 and April 11.  </p>
<p>Despite the powerhouse performance by blue chips, analysts were quite cautious, eyeing instead a rather mixed performance in the broader market. Indeed, buyers today appeared extremely focused and largely shunned mid- and small-cap stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;People are looking for companies with strong earnings and strong balance sheets,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;Money is moving towards predictability rather than projections.&quot;</p>
<p>Seasonal factors may have contributed to the sudden burst of buying, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the money we saw today is money that was put in retirement accounts by the April 15 (tax) deadline,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. &quot;And that money's going directly into index funds.&quot;</p>
<p>It was on April 15 that the Dow last managed a rally of this magnitude, posting a 135-point gain that then stood as the index's second best. Then, as on Tuesday, evidence pointed to a clear investor preference for safety over speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;What's very clear in the composition of mutual fund flows is that investors have become more risk averse,&quot; said Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the past four weeks, 60 percent of the new money is going to income or growth and income funds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Such funds, and the stocks they invest in, offer a combination of healthy dividend yields and lower volatilty that investors crave during periods of instability, he said.</p>
<p>Investors clearly remained shy of high-growth sectors like technology and smaller-capitalization stocks that typically offer neither.</p>
<p>The result was a broad market that saw advancing issues only modestly outnumber decliners on the NYSE. On Nasdaq, there were actually more losers than gainers.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is not the recipe for a healthy advance,&quot; said Ralph Bloch, Raymond James and Associates' chief technical analyst.</p>
<p>Other analysts agreed, opting to wait for a clearer picture before predicting clear sailing.</p>
<p>&quot;For this market to resume to the upside, it has to go back to the look and feel we had,&quot; said Gregory Nie, technical analyst, EVEREN Securities Inc. &quot;That means it needs more volume and it has to resume the breadth it had.&quot;</p>
<p>Dow components AlliedSignal Inc, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co, Coca-Cola Co and United Technologies Inc each rose more than five percent.  </p>
<p>Drug shares were strong, led by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which jumped 3-5/8 to 63-1/2 after reporting first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. Merck &amp; Co Inc gained 2-3/4 to 89-1/4 and Pfizer Inc climbed 2-7/8 to 91-3/4.</p>
<p>Financial stocks also turned in a solid session, led by BankAmerica Corp, up 3-3/4 to 108-5/8, and Citicorp, up three to 105-1/2.</p>
<p>Eagle USA Airfreight Inc tumbled 8-5/8 to 21-7/8 after the company's second-quarter results fell short of Wall Street estimates.  </p>
<p>Viacom Inc fell three to 27-3/8. The company said it would issue shares to track the performance of its Blockbuster video chain unit. It also said it expected a decline in Blockbuster's first-quarter cash flow</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 14.24 points to 774.61.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 8.79 points to 1212.74.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks fell 0.18 point to 338.09, and the AMEX Composite fell 6.51 points to 544.96, reflecting the weak performance beyond the large-cap arena.</p>
