<p>Leading stories in the Greek general press:</p>
<p>KATHIMERINI</p>
<p>--Yesterday's surprise visit by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos to Skopje is a strong indication that a final and pre-determined solution to the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is on its way. The visit, oestensibly to discuss the Albanian crisis, also gave an indication of Athens' desire to become the stabilising factor in the region at a time of tremendous fluidity.</p>
<p>--Defence Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos reacted strongly to reports from Rome that Italy is prepared to send a frigate with a 600-strong crew to Durres to protect the distribution of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>--Former prime minister and honorary conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis yesterday publicly supported George Souflias for the post of New Democracy leader, warning that any other option would be &quot;suicide&quot; for the party.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROTYPIA</p>
<p>--Pangalos returned from Skopje with an invitiation from FYROM President Kiro Gligorov to Prime Minister Costas Simitis to visit the neighbouring country. The abnormality in Albania has provided an opportunity for a normalisation of relations with Skopje.</p>
<p>--One died and four were injured in last night's accident at the suburban Redi central vegetable market. The cause appears to have been the explosion of a chemical used to ripen bananas. Police fear other casualties may be buried under the rubble.</p>
<p>TA NEA</p>
<p>--Pangalos received an enthusiastic and diplomatic welcome in Skopje, where officials refrained from using FYROM's constitutional name for the sake of &quot;nameless friendship&quot;. Skopje said it would no longer insist on being &quot;descendants of Alexander the Great&quot;, according to reports.</p>
<p>ELEFTHEROS TYPOS</p>
<p>--George Souflias, one of the three front-runners for the leadership of the main opposition party, says he will stress meritocracy and transparency if he wins.</p>
<p>--Thirteen thousand people in the Evinos area live with the risk of a dam threatened by subsidence.</p>
<p>ETHNOS</p>
<p>--Forty-two tax offices face closure and another 15 merger, in line with Deputy Finance Minister George Drys's new plans to make tax collection more effective. --Maria Petrakis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
