<p>The Kenyan shilling was weakened on Monday dragged down by unmatched demand for dollars in a very thin trading session, commercial bank dealers said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean shilling rate of 55.32 against the dollar from 54.90 on Friday while against the pound, the shilling was posted at a mean rate of 93.39 from 92.67.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a lot of demand for dollars,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>But dealers said unlicensed pro-reform rallies planned for Monday by the opposition had slowed down business for the day with many fearing outbreaks of violence in the city.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is going to close early today. There's no activity -- everyone's just sitting on the sidelines,&quot; one forex dealer said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the suspension of the weekly coffee auction for the next two weeks is expected to keep dollar inflows from coffee exporters at low levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>Coffee is one of Kenya's biggest foreign exchange earners. The money market continued tight with overnight rates quoted at 23 percent unchanged.</p>
