<p>French stocks snapped a three-session winning streak on Monday after investors took profits on news of a long-awaited compromise deal by European Union leaders to keep the single currency project on track.</p>
<p>The market rose to all-time highs early on Monday on expectations that EU leaders meeting in Amsterdam would reach a compromise agreement to enforce budget discipline in the single European currency zone and strive to create more jobs.</p>
<p>Brokers said the bourse was shifting its focus to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's keynote policy address on June 19.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index closed down 12.65 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,795.87 after easing from an all time high at 2,825.18.</p>
<p>Volume was 6.7 billion francs, relatively modest as many investors held to the sidelines ahead of the Amsterdam summit declaration.</p>
<p>After three sessions of gains and a rise early on Monday to an all time high of 2,825.18 points, the bourse was due for a consolidation, traders said.</p>
<p>In addition to the political and monetary developments in Europe, investors are waiting for U.S. consumer price, capacity utilisation and industrial production data on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One broker noted the bourse has become expensive, with a Price-Earnings ratio of 27, surpassed in Europe only by Germany, Switzerland and Hungary.</p>
