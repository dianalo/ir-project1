<headline>Has US rise turned the tide for French rates?.</headline>

<p>Despite the first U.S. interest rate increase in two years, many economists in France do not see the tide turning yet this side of the Atlantic and expect more small rate cuts by the Bank of France, but not immediately.</p>
<p>There are, however, some dissident voices, who feel improved economic growth prospects worldwide, coupled with German fear of inflation, diminish the rationale for further rate-trimming and, if anything, suggest a cycle of European rate cuts may be over.</p>
<p>Either way, a majority of the rate-watchers believe France's independent central bank will not trim its key intervention rate at a policy council meeting this week, nor in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of eight economists showed only one betting on a cut this Thursday and equally few expecting such a move in the next few weeks, but five of the eight expected small cuts in the next few months.</p>
<p>France's intervention rate has been slowly whittled down by the Bank of France over the past year to 3.10 percent, just a tenth of a percent above Germany's key repo rate.</p>
<p>Many believe this &quot;softly softly&quot; process of cutting without endangering a policy of a strong French franc tied to the German mark has not run its full course.</p>
<p>They say the gap with German rates offers the Bank of France a bit more room for manoeuvre, even if only to match the German repo rate in a convergence expected ahead of monetary union.</p>
<p>Some say the U.S. rate increase announced on Tuesday evening -- to 5.50 from 5.25 percent -- was truly a pre-emptive step to ward off inflationary pressure in a robust U.S. economy, that it may not necessarily be followed with more quick hikes, and that, in any case, there is good reason to believe it will not have a domino effect in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing is what the Bundesbank's reaction will be -- I'd say there'll be none, that it's completely irrelevant,&quot; said Philippe Brossard, economist with ABN-Amro in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is not shooting up and there's no threat of inflation. Therefore, I feel, perhaps contrary to the market, that the Bundesbank could actually ease (rates).&quot;</p>
<p>Brossard said he believed Germany's commitment to European economic and monetary union (EMU) meant it wanted to ease rates to underpin economic growth and rely on other levers like fiscal policy to make sure it met the criteria for a single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore it would be easier to see why France (the Bank of France) would see room for more easing. The job has not been finished,&quot; said Brossard, noting that he was nevertheless only taking of small rate cuts.</p>
<p>But UBS economist Erick Muller said that the U.S. rate rise reinforced his bank's view that, apart from minimal tweeking, interest rate cutting in France had come to an end and that the risk was for a turnaround for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>In France, economic growth was likely to pick up this year to 2.5 percent from 1.3 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>In any case, the dollar's recent rise had given the French economy much of the lift it needed, without the help of rate cuts, he said.</p>
<p>And although inflation was not a threat in France, the disinflation seen in recent years had come to an end, meaning that the Bank was likely to be more on guard against any new rise in prices.</p>
<p>Bundesbank vigilance on inflation, especially the threat of &quot;imported inflation&quot; through an excessive dollar rise, raised the risk of counteractive action by the German central bank in the form of an increase in rates.</p>
<p>&quot;If the U.S. moved again, that would at best mean stability and at worst upwards pressure. We cannot necessarily just say the Bundesbank is going to continue to cut rates.&quot;</p>
<p>For France, Muller's verdict on rates is: &quot;We've hit the bottom point, bar very minor adjustments&quot;.</p>
