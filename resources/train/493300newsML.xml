<p>Mali's President Alpha Oumar Konare will face nine challengers in next month's presidential election, the second since the West African nation's democratic transition.</p>
<p>Constitutional court president Abdoulaye Dicko announced the names of the 10 candidates on state television late on Monday. The list, in a decree from the court, included five candidates who contested the first poll in 1992.</p>
<p>Konare, a historian who won office in the widely praised 1992 elections, will be seeking a second five-year term in the election scheduled for May 4 with a runoff on May 18.</p>
<p>Parliamentary elections are set for April 13, over a month later than planned. The second round is on April 27.</p>
<p>The others who stood in 1992 included Mountaga Tall, Drissa Traore, Almamy Sylla and Mamadou Maribatrou. They all finished way behind Konare, who polled 69.01 percent in the second round against Tieoule Mamadou Konate.</p>
<p>Konate, who represented the revived former single party the Sundanese Union-Democratic African Rally US-RDA, died in a road accident in 1995.</p>
<p>Mali's last elections followed the 1991 overthrow of dictator Moussa Traore by soldiers, led by General Amadou Toumani Toure, who ushered in civilian rule and stepped down.</p>
<p>Konare will run for his ruling Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADAMA), which had a majority in the old 116-seat national assembly. The new assembly will have 147 seats.</p>
<p>The opposition is grouped in two main alliances, the Rally of Patriotic Forces (RFP) and Front for Change and Democracy (FCD).</p>
<p>Nine candidates contested the presidency in 1992.</p>
<p>Municipal elections are scheduled for June 1 to wrap up Mali's second multi-party polls since the transition.</p>
<p>Parliament's mandate ends on April 17, Konare's on June 8.</p>
