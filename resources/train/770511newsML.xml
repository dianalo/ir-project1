<p>UK-based global freight forwarder MSAS Cargo International Ltd said operating profit rose 13 percent to 10.7 million sterling in first half 1997, while turnover was six percent higher at 423 million sterling.</p>
<p>However, the strength of sterling had a significant negative impact on the figures and at constant 1996 exchange rates the profit increase was 23 percent and the turnover increase was 14 percent, the company added in a statement.</p>
<p>MSAS chief executive, Douglas Ash said: &quot;We are on target to achieve our goal of a three percent return on operating profit in 1997&quot;.</p>
<p>The overall gross margin showed a small increase despite the currency impact, while at constant exchange rates, the absolute gross margin rose by 15 percent in airfreight, 12 percent in customs clearance and three percent in sea freight, it said.</p>
<p>The fastest growth was in the supply chain logistics with a 21 percent rise, the statement added.</p>
<p>Air export weight increased by 18 percent to over 180,000 tonnes, with the average weight per shipment up by 11 percent to 290 kg.</p>
<p>In the airfreight sector, export air weight in North America showed a modest three percent improvement but continued growth was seen in Europe and throughout Asia-Pacific with increases of 13 percent and 27 percent respectively, the statement said.</p>
<p>The company is a member of Ocean Group Plc which earlier today reported pretax first half profits of 32 million sterling compared to 27 million last year on a turnover of 570.8 million (550 million) - Reuters Air Cargo Service Tel+ 44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017 - www.racs.com</p>
