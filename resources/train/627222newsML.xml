<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi unveiled a three-year economic strategy on Friday which he said would make Italy's bid to secure a place in a European currency union unstoppable.</p>
<p>Prodi told a news conference after a two-and-a-half-hour cabinet meeting which approved the rolling strategy, known as the DPEF, that Italy could leave nothing to chance and had to restore complete order to state finances.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the Prime Minister's office said the strategy had &quot;two fundamental objectives... participation in European economic and monetary union and restoring health to public finances&quot;.</p>
<p>Italians, already reeling from a massive increase in taxation over the past 18 months, were told that one more dose of pain would be enough to steer the economy back to calmer waters it had not enjoyed since the 1960s.</p>
<p>&quot;The commitment that today is asked of this government is that of completing what has already been started... in time to allow Italy to take part from the start in the construction of economic and monetary union,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The path that is left to travel towards this objective is short, the benefits certain,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>One of the most ambitious targets set out in the plan was to slash the public debt to gross domestic product ratio -- a key measure of the state of health of public finances -- to 1.8 percent by the year 2000 from 6.7 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The thrust of Prodi's strategy has been to set in motion a virtuous circle of lower deficits and declining interest rates which in turn will reduce a hefty interest bill on the national debt mountain.</p>
<p>The immediate challenge facing the government has been to wrestle the debt-to-GDP ratio down to three percent by the end of this year, thereby meeting a key criterion for EMU membership spelled out in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>To make sure that state finances stay on an even keel in the future the government said it would push through a 1998 budget slicing a further 25 trillion lire off the deficit, by combining 15 trillion lire of spending cuts with 10 trillion of revenue raising-measures.</p>
<p>But the DPEF said Italy needed to carry out reforms to its system of welfare provision and called for a shakeup of the pensions system but steered clear of how this would be achieved.</p>
<p>Economic analysts said they were not surprised that the strategy document had avoided stepping on the minefield of how to cut an escalating pensions bill.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has its hands tied. In order to get the document accepted by some parts of the government they are forced to remain vague,&quot; said Gianluca Sanna, an economist at Stone and McCarthy in London.</p>
<p>Trade unions and the government's hard-left Communist Refoundation ally said after talks with Prodi in the course of the week that they strongly opposed any radical measures to curtail pensions provision.</p>
<p>The government said it was forecasting economic growth of 2.0 percent next year, rising to 2.5 percent the following year and 2.7 percent in the year 2000.</p>
<p>A shadow was cast over these optimistic projections by official data released on Friday showing that the economy contracted in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product fell by 0.5 percent in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of last year and registered a 0.3 percent fall from the final quarter of 1996.</p>
