<p>Irish bonds were unchanged in late trade on Thursday as dealers sat on their hands ahead of the Easter holiday weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been very quiet in all markets. There is a real holiday mood to it all,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Earlier in the week people were waiting to see if the Federal Reserve would raise U.S. interest rates. Now people are thinking why should they invest today as they won't be able to look at how their investment does until Tuesday, so why do anything,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>By 1535 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was unchanged from Wednesday's close at 101.15 to yield 6.19 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was unchanged from the close at 107.50 to yield 6.88 percent.  </p>
<p>Looking ahead, dealers said a close eye will be kept on any U.S. data releases and particularly next week's non-farm payrolls figures for clues as to whether or not a further rise in U.S. rates was likely.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were lower after February existing home sales came in higher than expected.</p>
<p>Sales of existing homes rose 9.0 percent last month to a seasonably adjusted annual rate of 4.26 million. The January annual rate was a revised 3.91 million.</p>
