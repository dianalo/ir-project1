<headline>Stocks get lift from Greenspan's comments.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks closed higher Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared to back away in his latest comments from favouring another interest rate hike.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.91 points to 7,169.53, one day after jumping 51 points on a proposed cut in the capital gains tax.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 1,525 to 933 on moderate volume of 455 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The first moments of the session saw a flurry of activity, as investors struggled to divine the Fed's next move from a speech delivered by Greenspan in New York late Thursday.</p>
<p>But stocks quickly settled back into a narrow trading range, as Wall Street once again found nothing in the way of conclusive evidence in the Fed chief's comments.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people can read whatever it is they wanted to in his comments,&quot; said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter. &quot;He did allude to some good things happening but there was really nothing new here.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed, it seemed that Greenspan's speech included at least one warning to offset every piece of good news.</p>
<p>He spent much of the speech defending the Fed's March interest rate increase, pointing to the need for the central bank to act pre-emptively against inflation risks. But he also cast some doubt whether such a need existed now.</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure, 1997 is not 1994 when the Fed was forced to tighten monetary conditions very substantially to avoid accomodating rising inflation,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
<p>In was in 1994 and early 1995 that the Fed raised short-term interest rates seven times, doubling rates to 6 percent from 3 percent in the process.</p>
<p>While analysts are divided on whether the Fed will pause before moving again, many argue that regardless of the next move, the stock market's recent rebound has taken prices to a level where risks likely outweigh rewards over the near term.</p>
<p>Bonds also shot higher, with the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up more than half a point, lowering its yield to 6.89 percent from 6.94 percent on Thursday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&quot;We're definitely cautious here,&quot; said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. &quot;The risk right now is to the downside rather than to the upside.&quot;</p>
<p>With wholesale and retail price, industrial production and housing starts reports all due next week and the Fed's May 20 meeting drawing closer, analysts said the market would likely resume its choppy pattern, living data to data.</p>
<p>Among individual issues, Cephalon Inc. slid 7 to 13 after a Food and Drug Administration panel recommended against approving Myotrophin, the company's treatment for Lou Gehrig's disease. Chiron Corp., Cephalon's development partner for the drug, fell 7/8 to 19-1/8.</p>
<p>Intel Corp. gained 3/4 to 159-1/2. The company said a design flaw in it its Pentium II and Pentium Pro processors could be fixed with software and would not require a mass recall of the chips.</p>
<p>Ball Corp. fell 1-3/8 to 26-1/8 after the shares were downgraded by Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Clayton Homes Inc. lost 3/4 to 13-5/8 and Oakwood Homes Corp. fell 3/8 to 21 after Oppenheimer &amp; Co. lowered its ratings on both companies.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index gained 4.22 points to 1,335.05.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 4.52 points to 824.78. The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.83 to 573.78.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.33 to 429.23. The average share was up 23 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,781.112 up 35.702 or 0.46 percent.</p>
