<p>The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is &quot;not hopeful at all&quot; of raising capcity on the AC segment of the Pacific Intertie by next month, a company spokeswoman said Friday.</p>
<p>BPA administrator Randall Hardy said at a congressional hearing in Los Angeles last week the federal agency expected to increase capacity on the line to 3,600 megawatts (MW) by mid-December.</p>
<p>He said work to correct voltage support problems at the McNary hydroelectric dam on the Columbia River was near completion.</p>
<p>But the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC), which oversees operation of the western power grid, says other criteria need to be met, the BPA spokeswoman said Friday.</p>
<p>Capacity on the 4,800 MW AC line, part of the high-voltage system linking the Northwest and Southwest power markets, is currently limited to 3,200 MW north to south and 3,675 MW south to north, according to Bonneville.</p>
<p>The agency still &quot;absolutely hopes&quot; to raise capacity on the AC, as well as DC (direct current), intertie lines in time for next spring's runoff, the BPA spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have a financial loss&quot; if the lines are not able to carry the large volumes of hydroelectric power generated in the spring, she noted.</p>
<p>Full studies on how to guarantee voltage support on the transmission system are not expected before January.</p>
<p>Power transmissions on the 3,200 DC segment of the line have been capped at 2,000 to 2,200 MW since the August 10 outage, also because of voltage support concerns.</p>
<p>Bonneville expects to release a follow-up study of the outage next week.</p>
