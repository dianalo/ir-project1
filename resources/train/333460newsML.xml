<p>Marxist rebels holding 73 hostages for a 39th day answered police manoeuvres around the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence by firing two warning shots into the air on Saturday.</p>
<p>The gunfire sent journalists scurrying for cover and put police on alert. They crouched and trained their guns on the fortified compound.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the rebels) simply fired into the air,&quot; said a police officer on patrol two blocks from the residence.</p>
<p>On hearing the gunshots, two special forces police rushed a side door of the compound and appeared to listen to activity inside, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The Red Cross entered the residence after the shots and confirmed there were no injuries. &quot;We ask for calm so as not to put any lives at risk,&quot; Red Cross representative Ruben Ortega said.</p>
<p>During the standoff, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels have periodically fired warning shots into the air in response to police moves near the building.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, the MRTA accused the government of preparing for a storming of the besieged home by staging military moves around the building.</p>
<p>Armoured vehicles rolled up to the residence on two occasions, while a police helicopter flew over and troops took up positions around the perimeter wall with guns trained on the building.</p>
<p>The helicopter made several passes over the building on Saturday, including after the shooting.</p>
<p>However, the government pledged on Saturday it would ensure a peaceful solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to take the time needed to reach a peaceful solution to this crisis without bloodshed,&quot; Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi told reporters.</p>
<p>Pandolfi gave no evidence, however, that talks were imminent. They have stalled over the government's refusal to consider the MRTA's main demand for the release of some 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori also sought to defuse tensions, insisting the police were merely doing their job of patrolling and called for calm.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need is a period with not much talking but time for everyone to reflect,&quot; he told a news conference after a two-hour meeting with his negotiator, Domingo Palermo.</p>
<p>Fujimori has offered the roughly 15 heavily armed rebels safe passage to a foreign country, provided they lay down arms and release the hostages.</p>
<p>Palermo, however, revealed he had held a preliminary meeting with a commission of &quot;guarantors&quot;, who will oversee eventual talks, and insisted there was hope.</p>
<p>&quot;The Red Cross is preparing for the MRTA to eventually come out for the start of conversations,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going to be very clear. There is no deadlock. There is a prudent reserve.&quot;</p>
<p>Following the shots on Saturday, a band of Mexican mariachi musicians sang a birthday serenade to a captive judge. Witnesses said they also heard from within the building traditional songs about missing loved ones.</p>
<p>And songs of hope rang out from a 100-member evangelical group that marched around the site. Members stopped periodically to pray for the hostages' release; some women members wept.</p>
<p>On Friday evening an armoured personnel carrier approached the main entrance with special forces police on board training their rifles and machine guns on the residence.</p>
<p>Eight policemen, armed with assault rifles and night vision goggles, also rushed toward the compound's main entrance and crouched on either side training their guns on the building. Red laser beams were seen cutting across the garden to the house.</p>
