<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares firm on back of Dolenjska bank.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares firm on back of Dolenjska bank.</headline>

<p>Slovenian shares firmed 0.55 percent on Monday, boosted by a rise in Dolenjska bank after it said it planned to introduce a 15-percent foreign stake in the bank.</p>
<p>Traders forecast little price movement ahead of the May holidays starting this week, but said the index could jump as much as 30 percent after that when foreign activity is expected to resume.</p>
<p>&quot;It is almost sure that custodian accounts for foreign investors will be opened in May. Current volumes are so low that even a relatively small foreign input could cause a large jump in prices,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Slovenia in February blocked foreign trading by saying international investors had to open custodian accounts at a fully licensed Slovenian bank in order to be able to trade in securities.</p>
<p>Banks said the first accounts would be open in the first half of May.</p>
<p>Traders said shares of bank Dolenjska banka, food maker Droga, drug firms Lek and Krka and shopping centre operator BTC were likely to record the biggest share price gains this year due to solid earnings results and prospects.</p>
<p>The blue-chip SBI index firmed 7.29 points to 1,322.39.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of bank Dolenjska banka had the highest turnover, up 3.33 percent to 15,500 on volume of 1,470 shares.</p>
<p>Traders said Dolenjska could jump as high as 20,000 tolars in the next two weeks on the news that Japan's Daiwa Bank had cited interest in taking a stake in the bank and also due to having posted a good set of 1996 earnings.</p>
<p>Overall six shares rose, 11 fell, two were unchanged and eight were untraded.</p>
<p>BTC was the top gainer, up 3.78 percent to 14,000 tolars on speculation the company may soon decide to issue GDRs in order to be able to support its expansion plans.</p>
<p>Mineral water producer and health resort operator Radenska was the leading decliner, down 9.08 percent to 1,673 tolars as a raft of small investors bailed out of the stock.</p>
<p>Traders said Radenska could fall further to about 1,500 tolars if small investors continued to sell on the back of limp 1996 results and an apparent reluctance by Radenska to defend its share price. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
