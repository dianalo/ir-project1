<title>USA: BASEBALL-MARINERS SIGN DENNIS MARTINEZ TO MINOR LEAGUE DEAL.</title>
<headline>BASEBALL-MARINERS SIGN DENNIS MARTINEZ TO MINOR LEAGUE DEAL.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dennis Martinez, the second most successful Latin American pitcher of all time, agreed to terms on a minor-league contract with the Seattle Mariners on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old Martinez, who hopes to compete in his 22nd year in the majors, was limited to just 20 starts last year for the Cleveland Indians due to right elbow problems. Still, the native Nicaraguan went 9-6 with a 4.50 earned run average over 112 innings.</p>
<p>Martinez, who has 240 career major league wins, is three wins shy of equalling Hall of Famer Juan Marichal's Latin American standard of 243.</p>
<p>The right-hander broke into the majors with Baltimore in 1976 and pitched with the Orioles for 11 seasons. He was dealt to Montreal in June 1986 and enjoyed a resurgence in his eight years with the Expos.</p>
<p>After three All-Star teams and leading the majors in ERA (2.39) in 1991, he signed as a free agent with Cleveland in 1994. Martinez owns a career 240-182 record with 121 complete games and 3.63 ERA over 630 appearances.</p>
<p>Martinez, who will report to camp Friday, will battle Chris Bosio, Bob Wolcott and Jamie Moyer for the fourth or fifth spot in the rotation. Randy Johnson, Jeff Fassero and Scott Sanders are Seattle's top pitchers.</p>
