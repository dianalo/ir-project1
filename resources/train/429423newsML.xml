<headline>NatWest restarts Potash with &quot;buy&quot; rating.</headline>

<p>NatWest Securities Corp reinstated coverage of Canadian fertilizer company Potash Corp of Saskatchewan with a &quot;buy&quot; rating, NatWest analyst David Nelson said on Monday.</p>
<p>NatWest had been restricted from commenting on Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Potash Corp while the brokerage acted as adviser to the company for its acquisition of nitrogen fertilizer producer Arcadian Corp.  </p>
<p>Nelson told a conference call that his firm came back with its long-standing recommendation because of Potash's dominance in each of the businesses it operates, a strong cash flow and earnings outlook and industry consolidation among companies producing each of the three nutrients.</p>
<p>He said he assumed Potash would make about US$100 million per year in debt repayments, which would leave about US$322 million or US$6 per share of free cash flow to reinvest at 15 percent on a pre-tax basis.  </p>
<p>&quot;When you make that assumption and apply conservative market assumptions, we get earnings growth for this company in excess of 20 percent per year,&quot; Nelson said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's clearly less -- and we're trying to be conservative -- than they've shown over the last five years,&quot; he said. However, Nelson said the forecast was favorable for investors because Potash was trading at a 50 percent discount to NatWest's forecast 1998 earnings of US$8 per share.</p>
<p>Nelson predicted a favorable outcome in Potash Corp's stalled attempt to acquire German potash producer Kali &amp; Salz SDGF.F from majority owner BASF AG.</p>
<p>The German Cartel Office barred the sale in late February, a move that Potash and BASF appealed.</p>
<p>He said Germany's commerce department, which is required to respond to the appeal within four months, should find that combining Kali &amp; Salz with Potash Corp will strengthen the company and boost employment levels in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the odds on that going through around mid-year are pretty good,&quot; Nelson said.</p>
