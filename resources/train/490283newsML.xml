<p>Dirty tanker rates were mainly steady to weaker in quiet Monday trade amid generally low enquiry, brokers said.</p>
<p>Middle East very large crude carriers (VLCCs) to Japan and South Korea dipped to about W60 and W57.5 repectively, partly due to refineries in the two countries going into maintenance turnaround, one broker said.</p>
<p>In the U.K./Cont sector, 80,000 tonne cargoes fell markedly to W100 from W115 on Friday, continuing their decline after reaching W140 the previous week.</p>
<p>&quot;There's low enquiry and a lot of ships available, but you can still get over W100 for a good quality ship if the dates are right,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>The cross-Med 80,000 tonne market also showed a softer tone, with W120 still the rate for prompt loading but W110/112.5 for later dates, brokers said.</p>
<p>The West Africa market was stable, with 260,000 tonne VLCCs still at W70 and 130,000 tonne (million barrel) ships at W95.</p>
<p>The transatlantic sector was also steady, with the London Glory said fixed for 140,000 tonnes to east coast Canada at W95 for Irving.</p>
<p>The European fuel oil market was quiet, with brokers continuing to put 25,000 tonnes inter-U.K./Cont at W195 and cross-Med at W205.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, Caribs/upcoast 70,000 tonne crude cargoes fell five points from Friday to W230, but were still some 80 points above their 1996 average, according to data on Rigos Chartering Inc's Internet site.</p>
<p>Fuel oil 50,000 tonne vessels were five points up at W220, brokers said.</p>
