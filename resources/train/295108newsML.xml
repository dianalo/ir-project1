<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Wednesday that the Japanese government will keep careful watch over stock prices.  </p>
<p>Asked about the weak stock prices affecting corporate earnings and banks, Mitsuzuka said that it would be best if stock prices were stable but it seems that uncertainty was dampening market sentiment.</p>
<p>He added that some analysts and business officials see the economy as firm, but it seems that market movements do not seem to agree with that view.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that stock prices are continuing to fall means we must keep careful watch,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Asked to comment on the market's fall stemming from measures taken by the government on taxes and state finances, he said that the timing for ending the special income tax cuts this year was correct.</p>
<p>If Japan were to continue such cuts, it would have to continue depending on deficit-financing bonds and it would also make it difficult for the government to cut spending.</p>
<p>Although measures such as the ending of the special income tax cuts may have a negative impact temporarily, it is bound to gain public understanding when looking at it from a longer-term perspective, Mitsuzuka said.  </p>
<p>Japanese stocks took another steep tumble on Wednesday, with the key Nikkei 225 index falling 1.14 percent to 18,680.38, its lowest close in more than a year, on deepening gloom about the domestic economy.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka urged Japan's leading companies to take the initiative in boosting the economy and not depend too much on the government. Such moves would help brighten market sentiment, he added. He said he was well aware that financial markets reflected economic fundamentals, and would keep careful watch over them while continuing efforts to gain public understanding on the government's fiscal reforms.  </p>
<p>He added that although the economy may be going through difficult times it still has enough strength to achieve the government's growth target of 1.9 percent in the fiscal year starting in April.</p>
<p>Asked about his meeting with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke in Tokyo on Thursday, Mitsuzuka said he would like to discuss macroeconomic issues and Europe's move towards a single currency.</p>
<p>He said he would also like to ask Clarke for advice on how to ensure the success of Japan's &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reforms.</p>
<p>The government would like to submit bills setting timetables and targets to be achieved under the fiscal reforms to a session of the parliament due to start around January 20, he said.</p>
<p>A government committee to discuss fiscal reforms, which will be established later this month, will also consider whether measures to cut spending can be incorporated into the bills, Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>He said that to give an impression that Japan was not tackling fiscal reforms actively might lead to stagnation in Tokyo's financial markets.</p>
