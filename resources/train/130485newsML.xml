<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Monday that a visit to China long delayed by a diplomatic dispute over Tibet had resolved remaining problems in Bonn's ties with Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;There had been bumps in Sino-German relations...But things are now resolved,&quot; Kinkel told reporters after meeting his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen in Beijing.</p>
<p>Kinkel, who arrived in China on Monday for a five-day visit, said Qian had made clear that Beijing was interested in boosting Sino-German relations, strained in recent months by a dispute over China's policies in the restive Himalayan region of Tibet.</p>
<p>The two foreign ministers had also discussed human rights, specifically the cases of Chinese dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, he said.</p>
<p>Kinkel said earlier that Wang's family had appealed for him to raise the case of the former student leader, currently awaiting trial on the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an appeal by Wang Dan's family,&quot; Kinkel told reporters travelling with him.</p>
<p>Wang, a leader of 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing that were crushed by the army, was expected to be tried in secret, family members said. He had previously spent four years in jail for his role in the 1989 protests.</p>
<p>Kinkel gave no details of the content of his discussions on Wang or Wei Jingsheng, a veteran dissident sentenced to 14 years in prison last December for plotting to subvert the government.</p>
<p>Wei, known as the father of China's struggling pro-democracy movement and a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, was jailed for 15 years in 1979 and had been paroled for less than a year before his re-arrest in April 1994.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters about his talks with Qian on human rights, Kinkel said both sides had listened to the other.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a diaologue on human rights, but in a way that was not confrontational,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kinkel had originally planned to visit in July, but Beijing withdrew its invitation after the German lower house of parliament passed a resolution accusing China of trying to eradicate Tibet's cultural identity.</p>
<p>The dispute briefly threatened to affect China's economic ties with Germany, Beijing's largest European trade partner.</p>
<p>After talks in September on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly meeting in New York, Kinkel and Qian said they had cleared up outstanding problems and the German foreign minister's invitation was renewed.</p>
<p>Kinkel, who is also scheduled to meet President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng during his visit, had said his China visit was aimed at putting the row over Tibet to rest.</p>
<p>There were now good prospects for further exchanges on economic issues between Bonn and Beijing, he told reporters.</p>
<p>Qian had accepted an invitation to visit Germany in early 1997, he said. German President Roman Herzog will pay a state visit to China from November 18 to 25.</p>
<p>German opposition politicians have long been critical of Kinkel's policy towards China, accusing him of treading too softly on human rights issues for the sake of securing large industrial orders for German companies.</p>
<p>About two dozen representatives from German industry, many of them from companies specialising in environmental protection technology, are accompanying the foreign minister.</p>
