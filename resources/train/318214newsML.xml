<title>UK: LIFFE coffee jumps after Vietnam report.</title>
<headline>LIFFE coffee jumps after Vietnam report.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures, already buoyed by fund buying, jumped in late trade following news that Vietnam will consider joining the Association of Coffee Producing and Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>Technically-inspired fund buying made coffee firm earlier in the day, but the Vietnam news caused a sharp jump.</p>
<p>Most active May rose by $53 to $1,380 on volume of 4,825 lots. March rose $33 to $1,380 on volume of 3,200 lots. Total volume was 9,152 lots.</p>
<p>The rise put March at its highest level since November 21.</p>
<p>&quot;London has been undervalued for some time, but it's a bit overdone at the moment,&quot; one trader said of the rise.</p>
<p>He felt that now would be the easiest time for Vietnam to join, with most of its crop already sold.</p>
<p>Vietnam supports the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) and will consider joining the coffee producers group, said the Ivorian Minister for Commodities Guy-Alain Gauze.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam has expressed its support for the ACPC and said it will consider at a government level joining the ACPC,&quot; Gauze told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
