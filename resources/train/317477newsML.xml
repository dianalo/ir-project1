<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-01-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Although the U.S. stock market continued its record-breaking run last week, analysts say it is at a crossroads and any earnings disappointments in the week ahead could have severe repercussions there and in Asia.</p>
<p>Tokyo is likely to be especially nervous, with players keeping a close lookout for any moves by the Japanese government to postpone an increase in sales tax or to boost the stock market.</p>
<p>Fresh gains are seen for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, but some analysts say the market needs to catch its breath after the record performance.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia the outlook is mixed. South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore are seen gaining, but Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan and New Zealand are expected to find the going tough.</p>

<p>TOKYO - Stocks are likely to see nervous trading in the week ahead, with participants keeping a close eye on Japanese government officials' speeches scheduled for the convening of the parliamentary session on Monday.</p>
<p>On Friday, the key Nikkei 225 average closed at 18,090.04 points, up 786.39 from its closing on January 10.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will watch the parliamentary session very carefully,&quot; said Masaaki Higashida, deputy general manager at Nomura Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was anxious to see if the government would revise the 1997 state budget by postponing an increase in sales tax or an end to special income tax cuts, or propose any measures to help support the stock market.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - The Hang Seng Index is expected to set further record highs in the coming week but only after pausing for a brief consolidation, analysts said.</p>
<p>The blue chip index ended at an all-time closing high of 13,856.40 points on Friday, up 664.90 points, or 5.04 percent on the week. It rose above 14,000 points for the first time on Thursday, registering an intra-day high of 14,004.93.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the market trend remains quite positive so after it ends its consolidation, it will try to test the 14,000 level,&quot; said Ben Kwong, director of research at Dharmala Securities, who saw a trading range of 13,600 to 14,100 points this coming week.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - The Thai SET index is likely to decline on market jitters about expected weak fourth-quarter earnings for banks and finance companies, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The banking sector accounts for nearly 30 percent of total market capitalisation and expected selling of banks will hurt the market,&quot; said Samart Rusmeerojwong of James Capel Asia.</p>
<p>The composite SET index closed at 832.55 on Friday against 840.5 a week ago.</p>

<p>JAKARTA - Jakarta shares are expected to continue up in the week ahead, with buying interest spread evenly, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said Bank Negara Indonesia and a few blue-chip counters were likely to lead the upward trend.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Jakarta Composite Index ended at 663.97 points against last's week close of 657.87 points.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysian share prices are expected to extend recent gains on growing participation from funds and continuing retail interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Composite Index of blue chips closed the week at 1,224.55 against 1,232.38 the previous week. The Second Board index was at 612.93, up from 607.01. - - - -</p>
<p>MANILA - Philippine stocks are seen struggling to pierce the stubborn 3,300-point resistance level in the week ahead.</p>
<p>The main index ended on Friday at 3,294.31, up 32.17 points, or 0.99 percent, from the previous Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;If we break through the psychological barrier of 3,300, we could see the market trying to challenge the all-time high (of 3,375.94) in the next three weeks,&quot; said Nathan Lozada, assistant vice-president of Philippine Asia Equity.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SEOUL - Overall sentiment on the South Korean stock market will remain bullish but a brief correction appears to be inevitable in response to recent sharp gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite index closed at 701.18 on Friday, up 8.1 percent or 52.49 points from last Friday's 648.69. The gains have been attributed partly to the apparent fizzling of a nationwide strike call. The strikes have drawn few workers and had little impact.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Continued retail interest in small-capitalised stocks and foreign-fund interest in property and banking blue chips will keep the Singapore market firm, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said fears that foreign funds would be diverted into other regional bourses such as Hong Kong appeared premature as there was evidence on Friday of healthy inflows.</p>
<p>On Friday, the index rose 23.85 points in hectic trade to end at 2,244.21 against last Friday's close of 2,242.31.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares were seen posting further gains in the near term with mining companies expected to benefit from any uptick in base metals prices and big banks seen enjoying continued support.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,435.5 on Friday, up 16.9 points for the week after reaching a record high of 2,444.2 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to consolidate as the six-year resistance level of 7,200 remains tough to overcome, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index closed above 7,200 on Thursday, but ended at 7,173.42 points on Friday, compared with 7,094.77 a week ago. A 7,000-7,250 range was seen for the coming week.</p>
<p>Brokers said economic fundamentals, though improving, weren't strong enough to trigger any major gains.</p>
<p>But liquidity remains loose and one broker said another liquidity-driven rally was possible if any bullish news emerges.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - New Zealand shares' New Year rally was stopped in its tracks by higher-than-expected inflation data on Friday, and brokers expect a period of consolidation to follow.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 capital index closed 5.33 points lower at 2,429.56, for an overall rise of 22.75 points for the week.</p>
