<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher will hold hastily-arranged meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders this weekend as part of a new effort to revive the Middle East peace process, the State Department said on Friday.</p>
<p>Christopher will meet on Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, probably in Gaza.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton decided to dispatch Christopher on the mission to give an extra dimension to U.S.-brokered talks between senior Israeli and Palestinian officials starting on Sunday at Erez on the Israel-Gaza border.</p>
<p>&quot;Secretary Christopher plans to see Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat on Sunday as the negotiations resume in Erez,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the situation in the Middle East remains dangerous and requires attentive and intensive efforts,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>U.S. special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross is already due to attend the Erez talks, which were arranged at this week's Middle East summit in Washington called after bloody clashes in the region threatened to derail the peace process.</p>
<p>Christopher's mission is being tacked onto the start of a previously-arranged Africa tour.</p>
<p>Asked why Christopher was making the trip, Burns said that &quot;upon further reflection&quot; it was felt the visit &quot;would make the right symbolic points and give us a chance to discuss the substantive agenda with both and our hopes for results on that substantive agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli officials, including Netanyahu, hailed the two-day White House summit as a triumph. But many Palestinians called it a failure because no Iraeli-Palestinian disputes were settled, and warned of a possible resurgence of violence.</p>
<p>Burns denied Christopher's decision to travel to the region was in any way caused by these negative responses.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Clinton said he had told Christopher he wanted him to &quot;be there for the beginning of the talks,&quot; but Burns made clear he would not attend the talks himself.</p>
<p>Netanyahu telephoned Christopher on Friday and said he had taken steps to &quot;ease the internal closure&quot; in Bethlehem and Jenin, Burns said. Easing travel restrictions from Gaza and the West Bank is one of the main Palestinian demands.</p>
<p>Asked what Christopher would discuss with Arafat and Netanyahu, Burns replied: &quot;He'll want to review personally their agenda for these (Erez) talks, the common agenda that they have which is the implementation of the interim (Israeli-Palestinian) accords and their plans for moving forward quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Burns said one main issue under discussion would be redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Hebron. Israel imposed a curfew on Hebron during last week's fierce clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Christopher, who is to head for Africa on Monday, does not plan to visit Egypt, which has been a major player in Middle East peace efforts in the past.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stayed away from the White House Middle East summit and Christopher's last contact with the Egyptian government was a telephone conversation on Wednesday with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.</p>
