<headline>Dlr opens off in U.S. pondering Sakakibara remarks.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar opened lower against the yen as remarks uttered last week by a senior Japanese official continued to haunt the market, experts said.</p>
<p>Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, had told the Nikkei Financial Daily newspaper that the dollar's correction from last year's plunge versus the yen was about to end.</p>
<p>Yet Sakakibara reiterated on Monday that Japan's foreign exchange policy is unchanged and Japan welcomes the developments in foreign exchange markets since April 1995.  </p>
<p>The dollar reached a post World War II low of 79.75 yen on April 19, 1995, but has climbed sharply since then.</p>
<p>&quot;(Sakakibara has) said forex policy is unchanged, but he's never really come out with a full retraction which the market really takes as being a sign (the) Japanese are not totally displeased with a little bit of sell-off here in dollar/yen,&quot; said Ben Strauss, an assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer and Co.</p>
<p>Strauss also noted that weakness in Swiss/yen and mark/yen weighed on dollar/yen.  </p>
<p>Foreign exchange traders also took note of Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer's remarks on Monday.</p>
<p>After a meeting of the Group of 10 (G10) central bank governors, Tietmeyer said they saw world currency markets as relatively quiet at the moment. He also said the outlook for inflation in Italy had improved.</p>
<p>&quot;If the head German central banker says positive things about what Italy is doing...it should make the markets feel a little bit better that they're, in fact, happy with the improvements,&quot; said Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at First Union National Bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;But...the market's just not buying into (the upbeat remark about Italy),&quot; Gargano said. &quot;I think the reason is  because, yes it's an improvement, but he's not saying that (Italy is) there.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign exchange desks were thinly staffed in the U.S. because of the Veteran's Day holiday on Monday. Experts warned that thin trading could exaggerate fluctuations in the market.</p>
<p>At 1000 EST/1500 GMT, the dollar stood at 111.03/08 yen and 1.4970/80 marks, down from 111.70/75 yen and 1.5045/50 marks at Friday's close.  </p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.2580/90 Swiss francs at 1000 EST/1500 GMT, down from 1.2640/50 francs at the previous close.</p>
<p>Sterling inched up to $1.6480/90 from $1.6478/88.</p>
<p>The dollar traded near Canadian $1.3333/38, up from C$1.3313/18.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar opened at $0.7870/80, up from $0.7865/75.</p>
