<headline>Text of Yeltsin's statement before heart operation.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-11-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin issued a statement before going into surgery on Tuesday, thanking Russians for their support and reassuring them that there would be no power vacuum in Russia.</p>
<p>Following is the text of his statement. Translation by Reuters.</p>
<p>Dear Russians!</p>
<p>You know that I will undergo a serious operation. Today I want to say thank you to those who have been sending letters and telegrams wishing their president the speediest recovery.</p>
<p>Sympathy and a good word are sometimes more important to a person than any medicine.</p>
<p>My family is helping me in this difficult moment, taking care of me. My thanks to my wife, daughters and grandchildren. Thanks to you all.</p>
<p>My family and friends are concerned on the eve of the operation, they are nervous. But I am sure everything will go alright.</p>
<p>During the operation I have by decree transferred all presidential powers to the head of the government, Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Not for a minute will the country be without a leader with full powers. He and my other colleagues are tested and reliable people. They will have great responsibility in the time to come.</p>
<p>I do not intend to stay long in the hospital. I believe I will soon be working at full strength, as I did before.</p>
<p>Be aware that everything I have done, am doing and will do is all for the sake of Russia, for your well-being and for a worthwhile life.</p>
<p>It is especially important for me that you know that today.</p>
<p>I wish you all health and peace and good luck.</p>
