<p>CME pork belly futures tumbled late to close sharply lower with February posting a 2.000-cent-a-lb limit loss on local profit taking which touched off sell stops.</p>
<p>Hog futures firmed late to close mixed, traders said.</p>
<p>February pork bellies ended limit down at 76.975 cents. March also fell the limit in the closing range but settled 1.975 lower at 76.875 cents. Other months ended 1.400 to 0.500 cent lower.</p>
<p>Part of the break in pork bellies came from technicals as prices broke through a support level. Concern over increasing hog slaughter and seasonals added to pressure, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the seasonal demand is starting to get behind us in bellies and larger hog slaughter weighs on product,&quot; said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities Inc.</p>
<p>The belly market may be looking ahead to added fresh supplies of bellies as packers push to fill plant slaughter capacity, he said.</p>
<p>But the concern over more pork production is having just the opposite effect on hog futures which recovered from early profit taking losses to close strong in active nearby months, traders said.  </p>
<p>Packers are operating in the black and have a large capacity to kill hogs which is keeping cash hog prices stronger than expected at a time when hog supplies are increasing seasonally, sources said.</p>
<p>Part of the strength in pork cutout values is coming from increasing retailer demand and possible export business. There is growing speculation that pork exports are climbing, especially to the Pacific Rim, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is talk on that (exports) but we have not seen anything yet. You have to remember October is (National) Pork Month and usually we see some push and it wouldn't surprise me if we end up with some (extra) exports,&quot; Roose said.</p>
<p>He noted that the pork industry works hard to move pork during the upcoming time period to compensate for the added hog numbers that will be coming to market.</p>
<p>However, fund rolling pared October's gain. RBH, Refco and Cargill bought December and sold October, part of which is commonly known as the &quot;Goldman roll&quot;, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In hog options, commission houses offered February 70 puts and there was hedge interest in December, pit sources added.</p>
<p>Hogs closed 0.225 cent lower to 0.300 higher with October up 0.175 at 55.575 cents a lb.</p>
