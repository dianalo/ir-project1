<headline>Italian shares end higher following Euro bourses.</headline>
<text>
<p>1700 GMT - Italian stocks ended higher taking some support from the firmer trend to other European bourses and as the Italian cabinet approved its 1997 mini-budget, dealers said.</p>
<p>* Despite the weakness of Wall Street and the lower trend of bonds and the lira, there was some investor buying interest across blue-chip stocks, dealers said. But gains faded through the afternoon as U.S. stocks slipped and as the mini-budget was seen made up of stop-gap measures and not structural changes.</p>
<p>* Blue-chip Mib30 index ended 0.58 percent higher at 17,801 while all-share Mibtel was 0.43 percent firmer at 12,024.  </p>
<p>* Dealers said the latest details on the government's mini-budget showed the measures as largely technical moves to cut spending and were not addressing longer-term issues.</p>
<p>* Shares in tyre and cablemaker Pirelli ran into profit taking after announcing higher than expected results for 1996 with net profits up 43 percent and its dividend doubled. The shares ended off 1.08 percent at 3,765 lire.</p>
<p>* Other blue chips ended higher with Fiat up 1.46 percnet at 5,429 lire and banking stocks gaining with Credito Italiano up 1.27 percent at 2,399 lire, BCI gaining 1.55 percent to 2,298 lire and San Paolo 0.99 percent higher at 11,230 lire.</p>
