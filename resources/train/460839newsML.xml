<p>War-scarred Cambodia hopes to revive its largely lost culture of cinema when it hosts its first international film festival and competition next week, organisers said on Friday.</p>
<p>The First Southeast Asian Biennial Film Festival and Photo Exhibition will run from March 29 to April 5 and showcase films from Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Two awards will be conferred by an international jury and celebrities such as France's film star Alain Delon, Indonesia's Christine Hakim and Thailand's Jintars Sukhaphat will be on hand.</p>
<p>Twelve films are entered in the competition and 33 more will be shown in a fringe festival.</p>
<p>Cambodian cinema has suffered from decades of war and decimation by the ultra-leftist 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime, which systematically destroyed cultural tradition and killed many artists.</p>
<p>More than one million Cambodians, including the country's most educated, lost their lives during the &quot;killing fields&quot; period.</p>
<p>Only a handful of film makers from the 1960s are still alive. Some will join the festival and show their work.</p>
<p>The process of revival is a painfully slow one, making the festival an important opportunity for Cambodians to collaborate with their counterparts in the region, said festival organisers, who include the French Embassy, the embassies of Southeast Asian countries and the Ministry of Culture.</p>
