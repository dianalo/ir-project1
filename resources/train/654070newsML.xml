<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - JUNE 11 -------------</p>
<p>*   NYMEX crude and products' near term oversold condition is stirring sentiment for a period of consolidation or even correction</p>
<p>*   But analysts continue to eye it's downside structure for longer term direction.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and products futures were seen stable on Wednesday but while the near term oversold condition stirred sentiment for a period of consolidation or even correction, analysts continued to eye it's downside structure.</p>
<p>&quot;WTI (NYMEX crude) is in consolidation mode and finding support at $18.50 and resistance at $18.80-$19.00,&quot; Leslie Nicholas at GNI Research said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the products will have to be watched today and if July gasoline breaks below $56 cents a one cent move to technical support at 55 cents is on the cards,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;This would give a negative implication to the crude markets,&quot; Nicholas said.</p>
<p>Tony Machachek at Credit Lyonnais Rouse saw NYMEX coming in 10-15 cents a barrel higher on crude with products up around 0.25 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has moved so much to the downside recently and is looking increasingly oversold that we must be due a short-covering correction soon,&quot; Machachek said.</p>
<p>Fenella Graham at MeesPierson was more bearish saying the market remained soft with the preparation negative but saw any stability at these levels prompting short-covering</p>
<p>&quot;We sold again yesterday at $18.90 and although Monday's selling extreme was subsequently covered the market remains soft and so we held onto the shorts,&quot; Graham said of crude.</p>
<p>&quot;The story remains the same today, we must continue to sell the rallies unless prices remain above $18.70 leaving a buying extreme from yesterday's closing period, prompting us to start covering our shorts,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>NYMEX Crude and products futures eased in ACCESS trade, undercut by Tuesday's bearish, though as expected API report of growing U.S. stocks but were staging a recovery by late morning on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Graham added, &quot;prices have recovered from last night's close &quot;probably because the losses yesterday are now being seen as enough to take the bearish data into consideration.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, July crude futures traded down to $18.57 a barrel, 10 cents below Tuesday's settlement but recovered on Wednesday morning to stand around 10 cents up at $18.77 a barrel.</p>
<p>July gasoline fell 0.40 cents a gallon to 56 cents but here too the market recovered by over half a cent to stand at $56.60 cents a gallon. Heating oil rebounded to trade at 51.90 cents after dipping to 51.40 cents a gallon from a settlement of 51.65 cents.  </p>
