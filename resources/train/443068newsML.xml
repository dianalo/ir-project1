<title>ITALY: Britons say Italians left them to Albanian mob.</title>
<headline>Britons say Italians left them to Albanian mob.</headline>
<dateline>BRINDISI, Italy 1997-03-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britons evacuated from Albania complained on Friday that Italian soldiers sent to rescue them had left them stranded overnight on a freezing beach at the mercy of an armed mob.</p>
<p>Several Britons, ferried to southern Italy on the warship San Giusto, said the Italians had shot dead one Albanian and wounded four in a gun battle in the port of Durres on Thursday night. They said the Italians then retreated out to sea and did not return until dawn to pick them up.  </p>
<p>The Italian Defence Ministry said earlier that the rescue operation had been suspended for several hours overnight due to shooting in the air by Albanians and fog.</p>
<p>Its statement made no mention of casualties and a spokesman at the ministry, asked to comment on the Britons' allegations, said he had no information on the matter.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have congratulated Italy for rescuing their nationals, who were among up to 900 evacuees on the San Giusto when it docked in the port of Brindisi.</p>
<p>But five Britons who spoke to Reuters were furious. &quot;You've got to ask the Italian authorities why they evacuated their own people and left women and children on the beach to face a wild mob firing Kalashnikovs,&quot; oil worker Derek Tyldsey said.</p>
