<p>The Polish zloty inched sideways just under resistance at three percent from parity on Tuesday and dealers said the local currency would likely refrain from any upward tests against the basket in the next several days.</p>
<p>&quot;Tuesday's scenario of slow trade under resistance levels may be the rule this week...unless some fundamental news shake the market,&quot; said Artur Wolak from PPAB SA (corrects from PPAM Bank SA) in Krakow.</p>
<p>Dealers said the expected main source of zloty growth this week, foreign investor entry into Polish fixed bonds, had already quietly passed through the market in the last few days.  </p>
<p>Foreign investors bought the vast majority of the 200 million zlotys of 12-percent fixed bonds, payable on March 5, sold at last week's primary tender.</p>
<p>The zloty closed at 3.02/2.97 percent from the trading band centre, a touch stronger than Monday's 2.96/2.93 percent.</p>
<p>It closed at 3.0370/85 to the dollar, up from 3.0390/00 on Monday and at 1.8129/36 to the mark, up from 1.8137/42.</p>
<p>One-day deposit rates were expected to stay at present levels for the rest of February's reserve period, which ends on Thursday, despite large payments for central bank drainage operations on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
