<title>HUNGARY: Budapest criminals fire anti-tank weapon.</title>
<headline>Budapest criminals fire anti-tank weapon.</headline>

<p>Hungarian police said on Thursday the level of violence in Budapest had reached a new peak with the use of an anti-tank weapon in an attack on an empty flat above a nightclub where a New Year party was being held.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in the history of the Hungarian police we've had to deal with such a weapon,&quot; Budapest police spokesman Endre Nagy told Reuters.</p>
<p>A shoulder-launched armour-piercing shell failed to explode in the early hours of Wednesday morning when it was fired into an empty flat above a night club where owners and employees were celebrating New Year. No one was hurt and damage amounted to just $2,000, police said.</p>
<p>Nagy said if the World War Two Yugoslav-made shell had exploded there would have been many casualties.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an anti-tank weapon, with this it is possible to demolish a whole building,&quot; he said. &quot;If it had hit the ground floor and gone off, at least 15 people would have been killed.&quot;</p>
<p>Nagy said that police were not ruling out a link with a series of grenade attacks over the last three months which have damaged property -- mainly night clubs and massage parlours. There have been no injuries in the attacks.</p>
<p>Following the police's failure to solve the recent spate of crimes, the Hungarian government sacked the chiefs of the national and Budapest police forces in November, then appointed officers from outside Budapest to replace them.</p>
