<p>Croatian stocks closed mixed on Friday as  leading issues Zagrebacka Banka and Pliva ended their rally, and market  participants foresaw a further slowdown next week and price corrections.</p>
<p>&quot;This was quite a dynamic day considering it's summer,&quot; said Domagoj  Grabovac of FIMA brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;The stocks that have long been neglected in favour of the blue chips  played the main role today,&quot; he added, outlining fully-listed Varazdinska  Banka, food concern Podravka and hotelier Laguna Porec.</p>
<p>One of the two market heavyweights -- Pliva -- did not trade on Friday,  while Zagrebacka lost 60 kuna to 2,350, with only 849 shares sold.</p>
<p>Both peaked at all-time highs earlier in the week after their Global  Depository Receipts (GDRs) surged in London but these have since also  lost ground.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka's 1/10 GDRs receeded to $37.125 each from $37.25 at Thursday's  close. Pliva's GDRs, issued at five to a share, traded at $17.25 after  fetching $17.825 earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;Zagrebacka and Pliva are definitely out of puff and a downward correction  may ensue,&quot; Grabovac said. Their decline will pull the rest of the  small Croatian stock market down at the peak of the tourist season  in August, he added.</p>
<p>Six of 14 active issues rose on Friday, five fell and three ended  flat. Volume fell to 9,898 from 25,898 units and turnover shrank to  4.7 from 16.8 million kuna.</p>
<p>But Grabovac said Podravka and hoteliers, led by Plava Laguna, might  enjoy a mild growth next week: &quot;Still it's a storm in a teacup --  small supply and strong demand creating a euphoria which will be of  short breath&quot;.</p>
<p>Laguna gained 10 kuna to 1,450.5 with 417 shares changing hands on  Friday. Of three other active hoteliers one rose, one was flat and  Arenaturist led the decliners, losing 39 kuna or 23.74 percent to  close at 106 kuna with 59 shares sold.</p>
<p>Gainers were led by Varazdinska Banka, advancing on rumours that its  half-year results had already overshot plans for the entire year,  said Denis Fuduric of IB Austria.</p>
<p>The bank's ordinary stock was most actively traded with 4,648 units  sold and it rose 17 kuna to 239. Grabovac predicted the price could  well overshoot 240 kuna next week.</p>
<p>Its preferred shares added 30 kuna to 150.</p>
<p>Podravka was the second most active issue with 1,929 shares sold,  gaining two kuna to 265 to recover from the doldrums.</p>
<p>Another of this week's record breakers brewery Karlovacka Pivovara  lost 15 kuna to 635 on a modest volume of 60 units. The subsidiary  of Chile's Cervecerias hit 650 kuna on Thursday after opening the  week at slightly above 550.</p>
