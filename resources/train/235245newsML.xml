<title>GREECE: Greek rates hold, bond profit taking in late trade.</title>
<headline>Greek rates hold, bond profit taking in late trade.</headline>

<p>Secondary bond market activity picked up steam on Wednesday with domestic and foreign players raking in profits but money rates were unmoved and ecu/drachma was holding despite sales of 100 million ecus at the fixing, dealers said.</p>
<p>A foreign bank also sold 9.0 billion yens for drachmas at the fixing. A yen-denominated loan for state railways organisation (OSE) accounted for the sum, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of trading activity in bonds today with some players taking profits on older FRNs,&quot; said a state bank trader. &quot;Local and foreign investors kept on selling FRNs with short maturities and strips to get into newly auctioned ones.&quot;</p>
<p>Money dealers said depos and forex forwards were little changed in late dealings on light to moderate trading volume.</p>
<p>The central bank injected overnight funds at an unchanged 13.40 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if the central bank is following a different interest rate policy from the finance ministry that cuts rates on its debt paper aggressively,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;This policy does not bode well for the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.00/10 drachmas from Wednesday's 157.070 fix, the dollar at 244.81/91 drachmas from 245.120 and the Ecu at 303.55/65 from 303.750 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 12.85-13.35</p>
<p>** T/N at 12.85-13.35</p>
<p>** S/N at 12.85-13.35</p>
<p>** One week at 12.70-13.20</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 12.70-13.20</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 12.60-13.10</p>
<p>** One month at 12.55-13.05</p>
<p>** Two months at 12.40-12.90</p>
<p>** Three months at 12.35-12.85</p>
<p>** Six months at 12.30-12.80</p>
<p>** Nine months at 12.30-12.80</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 12.30-12.80</p>
