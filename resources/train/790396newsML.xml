<title>USA: COMEX copper ends weaker on light fund selling.</title>

<p>COMEX copper ended weaker breaking through trendline support, but rebounding on light trade buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>The breakthrough of support at 105.00 cents a lb in September on light fund selling looked bearish initially, but arbitrage and trade buying took the market right back up by the close.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is higher,&quot; said Joe Rosta, director of research for CPM Group. &quot;Demand is stronger in the United States and Europe, strong enough to take prices higher.&quot;</p>
<p>He downplayed the increasing London Metal Exchange warehouse stock increase of the last eight weeks as a function of arbitrage and slow seasonal demand, which &quot;will pick up after Labor Day.&quot;</p>
<p>Other traders disagreed, believing the high stocks would eventually weigh down on the market. &quot;There's a lot of copper around,&quot; said one commission house broker. &quot;We expect a lot more coming onto the warehouses, which should weigh down on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks increased another 1,700 tonnes to 250,400 tonnes, while the LME cash-to-three-month backwardation was steady at $18/$22 a tonne.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side of the market, striking union workers at Falconbridge Ltd's Sudbury complex, represented by the Canadian Auto Workers, are waiting on a response from the company on a new proposal on shift scheduling to the company.</p>
<p>The strike has entered its second week.</p>
