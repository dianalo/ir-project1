<p>Newly-elected British MPs who do not swear an oath of loyalty within the next few days will not be allowed to use the facilities of parliament, speaker Betty Boothroyd said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Boothroyd's ruling will frustrate plans by the two members of Sinn Fein elected on May 1 to set up a representative office in parliament but not actually to sit in the House of Commons.  </p>
<p>&quot;Those who choose not to take their seats should not have access to the many benefits and facilities now available in this House without also taking up their responsibilities as members,&quot; Boothroyd said in a statement to the Commons.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein candidates at the election said they could not sit in the British parliament as that wouild involve taking an oath of loyalty to Queen Elizabeth and her heirs.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams won the constituency of West Belfast by almost 8,000 votes while the party's chief negotiatior Martin McGuinness was the victor in Mid Ulster by just under 1,900 votes. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767</p>
