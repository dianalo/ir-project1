<p>Shares in telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG opened down 3.2 percent on Tuesday after its scorching Monday debut on stock exchanges in Frankfurt, Tokyo and on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Shares opened official trade on the Frankfurt stock exchagne at 32.80 marks, down from Monday's close of 33.90.</p>
<p>Shortly before floor trade opened on the Frankfurt bourse, the largest of Germany's eight regional stock exchanges, Telekom shares stepped back and forth over the 33.20 mark threshold, Monday's opening level.</p>
<p>Share traders said there was still large interest in the share from investment funds that were not able to buy as much of the heavily oversubscribed issue as they wanted but were mixed over how high the shares would rise.</p>
<p>Some thought the share would be stopped before reaching 35 marks, while other more bullish investors saw it surpassing this threshold and possibly touching 36 marks.</p>
<p>Noting that the share price is well above the level that most analysts consider to be the stock's fair trading value, some investors were already begin to exercise caution.</p>
<p>&quot;We are certainly not going to buy more shares off the cuff, but rather will wait and see which way the shares swing,&quot; said Gerhard Langenbach, an executive with Union Investment, Germany's fourth-largest investment fund.</p>
<p>&quot;There are other international telecoms companies that are less expensive,&quot; he told reporters late on Monday, adding that Union Investment bought Telekom shares for 100 million marks.</p>
<p>The stock is due to take its place among the main DAX index of Germany's leading shares later on Tuesday, where it will be the 10th largest stock with a weighting of 4.5 percent.</p>
<p>The $13 billion global offering, second only to Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp in 1987, put 26 percent of the company's capital into public hands for the first time.</p>
<p>After shares closed with gains of 19 percent in Frankfurt trade on Monday, the stock roared off in trading on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $21-1/2, a 14 percent gain on the issue price, slightly off the opening of $22-1/8.</p>
<p>Investors in the United States were eager to cash in on profits quickly, noting traders had seen gains of $3 to $4 a share. Because the issue had been oversubscribed five times, analysts said there was plenty of room for demand to grow.</p>
<p>In Japan, Telekom set bells ringing on the Tokyo stock market as Japanese investors on Tuesday rushed to trade the newly listed share.</p>
<p>By the end of the day more than seven million Telekom shares had changed hands on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as Japan joined the frenzy seen in Europe and the U.S. on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue was popular even before it listed all over the world,&quot; said Tadahiro Kamogawa, general manager of the stock information department at Yamaichi Securities. &quot;It's only natural that the shares got off to a good start here, carrying over the enthusiasm from Frankfurt and New York.&quot;</p>
<p>The 7.2 million share trade volume in Deutsche Telekom pulled in a close second to the most heavily traded domestic share on the first section of the Tokyo bourse, hotel operator Gajoen Kanko with about 7.3 million.</p>
<p>The formerly state-owned firm's listing is the first by a U.S. or European company in Tokyo since 1993. Nearly five years ago the exchange prided itself on having 127 foreign issues.</p>
<p>But low liquidity, huge costs and the strong yen against the dollar forced many to leave.</p>
