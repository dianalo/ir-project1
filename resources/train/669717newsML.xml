<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate ends down on unemployment drop.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate ends down on unemployment drop.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended down 85 basis points at 18.50 percent on Wednesday due to what dealers said were positive unemployment data adding to a recent crop of bullish economic news.</p>
<p>&quot;There was demand for peso instruments in the market. The market has been stable and trending downwards since yesterday. The most important news has been unemployment and debt prepayment,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.</p>
<p>The National Statistics Institute announced during morning dealing that open unemployment in Mexico fell to 3.9 percent in May, from 4.29 percent in April.  </p>
<p>A Reuters survey of 13 financial houses had previously predicted an average jobless rate of 4.12 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment data came out this morning, and we had news on the $6 billion debt pre-payment yesterday, so we have a combination of favorable factors,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.</p>
<p>Dealers said a strong peso and U.S. long bond also helped secondary market rates to decline.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso ended 2.5 centavos firmer at 7.9030/7.9050, while the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond was up 14/32 to yield 6.69 percent in late trade.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico drained 4.300 billion pesos from the market through three direct Cetes sales and seven repos.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper closed down 120 basis points at 19.25 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 1.655 billion pesos was scheduled to return to the system on Thursday from prior central bank participation.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity would come under pressure, however, due to an overplacement of 290 million pesos from the primary auction, and demand for an estimated 800 million pesos of bank bills.</p>
