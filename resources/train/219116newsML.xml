<p>Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the nation's largest bank, on Tuesday announced a restructuring plan for its domestic operations which will result in a special three-billion Swiss franc ($2.3 billion) charge and a group loss for 1996.</p>
<p>UBS said it expected the group net loss to amount to about half a billion francs. The three-billion-franc charge was being taken to cover the future development of credit risk in its domestic portfolio and the measures would result in a reduction of the group's equity capital.</p>
<p>It said a provision of 120 million francs would also be taken to cover restructuring costs in the group's Region Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;After the measures have been implemented, group equity will amount to 21.5 billion Swiss francs at the end of this year, compared with 23 billion at the end of 1995,&quot; UBS chief executive Mathis Cabiallavetta said in the text of a speech prepared for a news conference.</p>
<p>The restructuring calls for the bank to reduce the number of so-called domestic economic areas to eight from the current 31.</p>
<p>It said direct rationalisation effects would be generated in particular by the concentration of support functions at only eight locations and a reduction in staff departments.</p>
<p>UBS also anticipates the elimination of some 800 domestic jobs as a result of the restructuring.</p>
<p>As a result of the restructuring, UBS said it expected incremental earnings of 200 million francs a year from 1998 onwards.</p>
<p>In addition, UBS said that as a result of the planned measures, Standard &amp; Poor's had put the group on its Credit Watch List. However, Moody's Investor Service and IBCA, the European credit rating agency, have maintained their long-term AAA ratings on the groups.</p>
<p>However, IBCA said it downgraded its individual rating on UBS to A/B from A, while maintaining its other ratings.</p>
<p>UBS further stated that its 1996 dividend would be unchanged despite the loss.</p>
