<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices came under pressure with supplies weighing down the market amid crude losses, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said some supplies that have been sold to Chinese buyers who had refused to take the cargoes were making their way back to Singapore.</p>
<p>One potential Chinese buyer valued these cargoes at about $102 per tonne on a cost and freight (c-and-f) basis to southern China, compared to the current $108-$113 per tonne.  </p>
<p>Traders said some unsold supplies have been disposed in the bunker market. Bunker demand has picked up in a rush ahead of the New Year by shipowners to cover requirements ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>In the LSWR market, an offer was heard for supplies loading in February at $20.25 a barrel against scarce bids. Another major said he would offer at $20.50.</p>
<p>Traders demand remained weak with Indonesia expected to allocate more supplies for February.  </p>
