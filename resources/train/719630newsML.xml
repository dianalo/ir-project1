<p>Treasury officials said on Thursday they have made progress in the fight against counterfeiters with the new, high security $100 bill that has proved impossible to match -- so far.</p>
<p>The bills, introduced in March, 1996, have sophisticated protections against high tech counterfeiting.</p>
<p>&quot;We have found that the security features have performed as expected and to date, the Secret Service has found no counterfeit Series 1996 notes it would characterise as highly deceptive,&quot; Treasury Undersecretary John Hawke Jr. told the House Banking and Financial Services Subcommittee on general oversight and investigations.</p>
<p>Hawke said that just 3.4 percent of all counterfeit notes passed to the public attempt to imitate the new $100 bill. He said the main problem has been that in many cases people do not yet know what the new bills look like, so they have nothing to compare.</p>
<p>The new bills have a large, off-centre picture of Benjamin Franklin to make space for a special watermark embedded in the paper. They also use colour-shifting ink, plastic security threads that glow in ultraviolet light and microprinting of the letters &quot;USA.&quot;</p>
<p>The Treasury also passed around samples of a new $50 bill -- not yet in circulation -- for members of the committee to examine.</p>
<p>But the committee remained concerned that the Treasury must do more to fight counterfeiting, especially abroad.</p>
<p>The congressional investigating arm, the General Accounting Office, has issued a series of reports charging that the Treasury has fallen short in carrying out anti-counterfeiting provisions in federal law.</p>
<p>&quot;The secretary of the Treasury's submitted plan does not demonstrate how it will enable the Treasury to meet the audit plan objectives required under the Act,&quot; a recent GAO report cited by Committee Chairman Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican said.</p>
<p>Bachus, author of a law requiring Treasury to redouble its efforts to track counterfeiting abroad, told the department officials: &quot;There is some reason for concern ... that the Treasury Department may not be taking this statutory mandate seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Finance Roger Anderson replied that the administration was improving its oversight of U.S. currency circulating abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now focusing more on the uses of U.S. currency and the quantities of genuine and counterfeit U.S. currency that are in circulation around the world,&quot; he said.</p>
