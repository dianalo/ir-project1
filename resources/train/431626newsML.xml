<p>Fletcher Paper rose strongly against a flat New Zealand share market on Monday.</p>
<p>The top 40 index dropped 8.89 to 2,280.07 mainly thanks to a number of stocks shedding dividends but Fletcher Paper spurted 13 cents ahead to $3.09.</p>
<p>Volume was typically light for a Monday at $44.4 million with much of it in Telecom, which dipped 18 cents to $6.51 including shedding a 9.5 cent dividend.  </p>
<p>J.B. Were broker Luke Koekoek said Tuesday could be an interesting session as Telecom was nearing perceived support levels. The company announced after the close that it had bought back a further 925,400 shares between $6.51 and $6.63 in its ongoing NZ$1 billion buyback programme.</p>
<p>Fletcher Paper was helped higher by news that Fletcher Canada had sold its stake in Timberwest for C$22 a share.</p>
<p>A Sydney Morning Herald article suggesting News Ltd could be ready to sell its stake in Australian Newsprint Mills to Fletcher also helped.  </p>
<p>Fletcher, the other half owner of ANM, refused News' A$300 million price last year and the price this year is picked to be much lower.</p>
<p>There was also demand for Fletcher Paper warrants, brokers said.</p>
<p>Investors in Fletcher Building took heart from a strong result from cement company Milburn. It ended square on $4.15 as did Milburn on $3.05.</p>
