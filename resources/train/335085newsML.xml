<headline>Portuguese shares mixed, PT stronger.</headline>
<text>
<p>1703 GMT - Portuguese shares closed mixed with several stocks lower in line with the foreign tone. Portugal Telecom, however, rose 2.2 percent and hit an all-time high of 5,659 escudos, buoyed by the healthy 1996 results of its mobile phone unit TMN.</p>
<p>* PSI20  up 0.21 pct to 5,783.72</p>
<p>* Cement group Cimpor traded at lows because of a sell order, dealers said. The stock was impervious to a buy recommendation from Espirito Santo Research, they said.</p>
<p>* Dealers said the trend in prices on Tuesday would depend on the close of Wall Street and the market's reaction to U.S. economic data. &quot;I think tomorrow will be a calm session until the release of the U.S. data (at 1330 GMT), and then we will see how the markets react,&quot; said one operator.</p>
<p>* The market was expected to focus on Banco Comercial Portugues, which was due to release its 1996 results after the market closed on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
