<p>Cameco Corp's gold mine in Kyrgyzstan is on schedule to start production in the first quarter of 1997, but the project is running 20 percent over budget, the company's president said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco initially budgeted US$375 million for the Kumtor project, Bernard Michel told a Toronto conference. But now the bill will likely come to US$450 million, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will take a while to complete a post-mortem review of the project, to search for the mistakes which were made,&quot; Michel said.  </p>
<p>The company underestimated the costs of transportation of personnel, materials and equipment to the site, said Michel.</p>
<p>And Cameco did not count on the costs of putting together complex financing and political risk insurance arrangements, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Kumtor being where it is, the logistics were unquestionably challenging,&quot; Michel said.</p>
<p>The costs are somewhat surprising, mining analyst Ray Goldie said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a disappointment but not alarming. You can still make money if you can produce gold at US$200,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Michel said he expects the mine will produce 500,000 ounces of gold per year at a cost of about US$200 an ounce.</p>
<p>&quot;We should have known better and realized that the recourse to a combination of multilateral and commercial banks in the first, large-scale mining project in the former Sovient Union was bound to take time and to contribute immensely to the wealth of the legal profession,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Michel also said he expects the recent recovery in uranium prices will be &quot;durable.&quot;</p>
<p>Cameco's main business is uranium.</p>
