<title>New zealand: Wellington Airport closed after Cessna crash.</title>
<headline>Wellington Airport closed after Cessna crash.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wellington Airport remained closed at 12.30 p.m. on Monday, following the crash of a light plane on take-off around 10.15 a.m.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Press Association reported that the plane, a Cessna 185, was believed to be owned by Soundsair founder Cliff Marchant.</p>
<p>NZPA said it careered off the runway when a wheel collapsed after an axle failure. It said the two people on board the Cessna 185, which was believed to have been operating privately, were not injured in the crash.  </p>
<p>Police, Fire Service, ambulance officers and the airport's rescue crash team were at the scene.</p>
<p>Cook Strait airline Soundsair has been grounded by the Civil Aviation Authority pending an investigation into safety issues.</p>
<p>Marchant is an Air New Zealand international pilot and uses the Cessna to fly to his home in the Marlborough Sounds.</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Authority deputy director Max Stevens said the Cessna was being operated privately at the time and was not on a passenger flight.  </p>
<p>Although the aircraft had been used in Soundsair's operations, the authority's &quot;initial reaction&quot; was that it was on a private flight and had nothing to do with the grounded company.</p>
<p>The Transport Accident Investigation Commission would be looking into the crash, Stevens said.</p>
