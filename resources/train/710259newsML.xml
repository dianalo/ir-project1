<p>Colombian President Ernesto Samper urged Venezuela on Monday to reject peace overtures from Colombian rebels along the two countries' border.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning I talked with Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera to ask him to abstain from making any kind of contact with Colombian rebels,&quot; Samper said at the swearing-in of his new National Drug Council chief, Ivonne Alcal. &quot;It is clear that with these international contacts the guerrilla wants to wash its hands abroad of its domestic guilt.&quot;</p>
<p>Samper said the Venezuelan president had agreed to open dialogue with the rebels only with Colombian approval.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), set up as a pro-Soviet force in 1964, said recently it wanted to start talks with the Venezuelan government to put an end to growing tensions in the border region.</p>
<p>The rebel group -- the largest and oldest in Latin America -- declared a unilateral ceasefire for Venezuelan targets last week &quot;in the hope that (Venezuela) would return the gesture,&quot; a regional FARC commander told Venezuela's El Universal newspaper.</p>
<p>Venezuelan Chancellor Miguel Angel Burelli said he was willing to talk with the leftist rebels on the condition that Colombia approved. Venezuela has, however, been cool to the idea of talking to Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN), which is also active in the frontier region and is reported to have launched a number of cross-border raids.</p>
<p>Samper announced he was launching a new peace process to try to end Colombia's three-decade-old guerrilla uprising after the FARC on June 15 released 70 troops, some of whom were captured in combat more than nine months earlier. But the momentum for talks has slowed since leftist insurgents increased attacks throughout the country.</p>
