<p>Blue chip stocks bounced higher on Thursday, boosted by reassuring economic data that showed inflation remains essentially at bay.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 76 points to close unofficially at a record 6626, the third time the blue chips have achieved an all-time high this week.</p>
<p>Stocks got an initial boost from the December producer price index (PPI), which confirmed inflation remained in check at the wholesale level last month. The report triggered a sharp rebound in the bond market that carried over to stocks.  </p>
<p>Overall, wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in December, the Labor Department reported. While the increase was more than economists had generally forecast, most of the rise was attributable to higher energy prices.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;core&quot; rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose only 0.1 percent in the month, in line with forecasts.</p>
<p>Bonds jumped on the news, with the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury rising more than a full point, pushing the yield down to 6.76 percent.  </p>
<p>With pressure on interest rates waning, investors held to a path they have repeatedly taken in the recent past and seized the opportunity to buy on Wednesday's drop in share prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The conventional wisdom is still to buy on every dip,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer and Co.</p>
<p>The market kept with another recent trend, Metz noted, because most of the buying was focused on large cap stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;In general, the money is coming in through intermediaries like mutual fund managers,&quot; he said, &quot;and they are still opting to buy the big names.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts noted that the flood of cash finding its way to mutual funds added fuel to the market's ascent.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in the midst of the deployment of funds that takes place at the beginning of the year,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. &quot;That liquidity is still a powerful driver for this market.&quot;</p>
<p>So powerful, analysts said, that investors were apparently able to overcome the caution that generally creeps in ahead of the closely watched monthly employment and wage report. Those figures are due Friday morning and many analysts consider them even more important than the PPI.  </p>
<p>&quot;I've got to say this rally is rather impressive ahead of what is supposed to be an important number,&quot; Metz said, adding that among indicators on the economy and inflation, he ranked the employment report &quot;number one.&quot;</p>
<p>For at least one sector, the PPI report proved an enormous boost. Shares in oil companies, which benefit directly from the rise in energy prices, jumped on the data. Exxon Corp rose 3-1/4 to 102-3/4 and Texaco Inc climbed three to 105 to lead all gainers among the Dow components.  </p>
<p>Hughes Electronics Corp rose two points to 63-1/8, on news that Raytheon Corp and Northrop Grumman Corp each bid $9 billion or more for Hughes' missile and defense business.</p>
<p>All three companies declined comment but investment bankers familiar with the situation confirmed the bids.</p>
<p>Raytheon fell 1-1/4 to 47-1/2, and Northrop slipped 1-3/8 to 77-7/8.</p>
<p>Neiman Marcus Group Inc tumbled 3-3/8 to 23-3/8 after the company said its second-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations because of soft holiday sales.  </p>
<p>CIDCO Inc slid 5-3/16 to 12-11/16 after Alex. Brown downgraded the shares to neutral from buy. The company, a maker of caller identification telephone equipment, said late yesterday that it would post an operating loss in its fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 6.44 to 754.85.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 5.85 to 1326.20.</p>
<p>Volume remained heavy, totaling 554.1 million shares on the NYSE, where advancing issues outpaced decliners by better than three-to-two.</p>
<p>(Figures official as of 1645 EST/2145 GMT).</p>
