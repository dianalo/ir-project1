<headline>SOCCER-REAL BEAT ATHLETIC TO RETAKE LEAD IN SPAIN.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-01-05</dateline>

<p>Real Madrid regained their lead in the Spanish first division on Sunday thanks to a solitary goal from teenager Raul Gonzalez in the snow-affected game against Athletic Bilbao.</p>
<p>With 42 points from 18 games Real are two points ahead of arch-rivals Barcelona, 1-0 winners at third-placed Deportivo Coruna on Saturday.</p>
<p>Real had the best of the game but were somewhat fortunate to take three points as Raul's 61st-minute winner took a lucky deflection.</p>
<p>The game could be played only because of the effectiveness of the undersoil heating in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium on a day when Madrid neighbours Rayo Vallecano saw their game with Sevilla postponed because of snow.</p>
<p>The club authorities at one stage had to appeal to fans to stop bombarding players and match officials with snowballs.</p>
<p>The other Madrid team, champions Atletico, came home 4-2 winners from struggling Extremadura after being put on their way by a goal by Daniel Prodan, the Romanian international who was making his Spanish first division debut.</p>
<p>Two fine goals from striker Kiko Narvaez sealed the game for Atletico, who went 4-0 up before a late recovery from the home side.</p>
<p>Atletico stayed fifth, 10 points off the pace and three points behind Real Betis who play Valencia on Monday.</p>
<p>Real Sociedad remained sixth thanks to a last-gasp winner against Zaragoza. The defeat left Zaragoza fourth from bottom just 20 months after taking the 1995 European Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
