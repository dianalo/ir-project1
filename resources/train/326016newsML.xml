<title>USA: Alaska Pulp to pay fine for air violations.</title>
<headline>Alaska Pulp to pay fine for air violations.</headline>
<dateline>ANCHORAGE, Alaska 1997-01-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Alaska Pulp Corp., the owner and operator of a pulp mill that has been closed for over three years, has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $646,579 to resolve federal complaints over air pollution, federal officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Once the penalty is paid, the Justice Department will dismiss its lawsuit alleging that the company's mill in Sitka, Alaska, violated state and federal air-qualtity standards from January 1991 to September 1993, when the mill closed, the Environmental Protection Agency said.</p>
<p>In the government's lawsuit, filed in 1995 in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, EPA charged Alaska Pulp with at least 250 days of violating the Clean Air Act at the Sitka mill, said Bob Jacobson, an agency spokesman.</p>
<p>Maximum penalties could have been $25,000 for each day of violation, Jacobson said.</p>
<p>EPA, represented by the Justice Department, said Alaska Pulp failed to install legally mandated pollution control equipment. By failing to do so, Alaska Pulp saved more than $600,000 during the 33 months of violations, according to EPA calculations.</p>
<p>&quot;This case underscores EPA's determinatino to make sure businessmen compete on a level playing field,&quot; Chuck Clarke, EPA's Northwest regional administrator said in a news release.</p>
<p>&quot;If businesses are expected to spend large sums of money on environmental controls and pollution preventon, they deserve to be protected from competitors who don't make the same investment. EPA owed it to other pulp mills to have taken this action,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The settlement was signed last week, Jacobson said.</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Alaska Pulp operated one of two mills in southeast Alaska that produced dissolving pulp from timber from the Tongass National Forest.</p>
<p>The second mill, owned by Louisiana-Pacific subsidiary Ketchikan Pulp Co., is scheduled to close in March.</p>
<p>Both pulp companies in the 1950s had been granted 50-year Tongass timber supply contracts in that provided large quantities of wood from the Alaska rain forest at discounted prices.</p>
<p>Over the years, the contracts drew criticism from environmentalists, who claimed the system subsidized clearcutting and other destructive activities.</p>
<p>Environmentalists have also criticized both pulp companies for air and water pollution from the mills.</p>
