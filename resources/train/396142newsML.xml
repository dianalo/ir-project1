<p>The U.N. refugee agency says more than 200,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees are unaccounted for in eastern Zaire since being uprooted by fighting between troops and rebels.</p>
<p>The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs on Saturday quoted figures from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) showing as of the end of January an estimated 193,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees had been located in large groups.</p>
<p>UNHCR said an estimated 189,590 Rwandan and 39,675 Burundian refugees were unaccounted for after having estimated the number of births and deaths among them since they fled their camps in the east.</p>
<p>UNHCR said a total of 1.25 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees were in eastern Zaire before a rebellion started in October last year and they were forced to abandon their camps.</p>
<p>It said by the end of January a total of 815,996 refugees had returned from Zaire to Rwanda and Burundi and 10,168 had arrived in other countries, leaving 432,013 behind in Zaire.</p>
<p>Zaire says it wants all the refugees to return home but many are trapped between government and rebel frontlines in the east. They include former Rwandan Hutu troops and militiamen, who had a leading role in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and their families.</p>
