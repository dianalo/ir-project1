<p>MGE spring wheat futures ended mixed, with nearby months gaining on a combination of mill and commercial buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said spring wheat also gained amid bullish forecasts for Monday's USDA stocks report. An average of analysts' estimates pegged stocks as of September 1 at 1.767 billion bushels, down from 1.881 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>The MGE Dec/March spring wheat spread, which was at a one-cent carry earlier this week, ended at an 8-1/2-cent inverse, which traders said reflected the degree to which players were rolling hedge positions from Dec to March.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat closed two cents per bushel lower to 2-3/4 cents higher, with Dec up 2-3/4 cents at $4.23.</p>
<p>Traders said Benson Quinn bought one million each of Dec and March and 500,000 July bushels. Atwood-Peavey bought 1.4 million Dec, they said.</p>
<p>MGE estimated Friday's wheat futures volume at 22.707 million bushels, up from 20.493 million on Thursday.</p>
<p>MGE March barley was the only barley future contract to trade. It closed up 1-1/2 cents per hundredweight at $7.12.</p>
