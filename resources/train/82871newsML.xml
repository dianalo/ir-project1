<p>Overseas Union Bank Ltd's president and chief executive officer Peter Seah said on Friday he expected Singapore's economy to grow by six to seven percent in 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;I see a 6-7 percent GDP growth,&quot; Seah told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said this was still &quot;a very healthy growth percentage so there should be a lot of opportunities for business.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore experienced rapid economic growth through the early 1990s with a jump of 8.8 percent in its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995.</p>
<p>But the recent slump in the global electronics industry, particularly in the United States, has slowed growth this year.  </p>
<p>Electronics and related products account for almost half Singapore's total industrial production and around 60 percent of its non-oil exports.</p>
<p>The government predicts Singapore's growth will average between seven and eight percent for 1996 as a whole. A recent Reuters poll of 11 leading economists forecast growth of 7.2 percent in Singapore's GDP in 1997.</p>
<p>OUB is one of Singapore's big four domestic banks.</p>
