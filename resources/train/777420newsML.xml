<title>JAPAN: TSE pinpoints cause of electronic failure.</title>
<headline>TSE pinpoints cause of electronic failure.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said on Monday it had traced a technical failure that affected trading on Friday to a loop in the pricing system of foreign stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have solved the problem by revising the program so that it will avoid calculating the price of foreign stocks, which is what caused the failure,&quot; Tokyo bourse president Mitsuhide Yamaguchi said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Concerning the matter of calculating share prices, we will conduct a review, including one on the program itself,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On Friday, the trading system was out of action for the entire two-hour morning session, halting trade in more than 1,700 issues, 108 of them on the benchmark Nikkei 225 average.</p>
<p>Unlike in October 1990, when a problem with cables halted trade, on Friday the electronic trading system itself crashed, the first time that has happened.</p>
<p>It was the worst mishap since the system was introduced in 1982, the bourse said.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret that we caused much disturbance,&quot; Yamaguchi said.</p>
