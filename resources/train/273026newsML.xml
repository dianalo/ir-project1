<p>One of Brazil's busiest investment bankers, Alfredo Gutierrez, does not carry a cellular telephone because he says the service offered in the country is lousy.</p>
<p>But the head of J.P. Morgan's Brazil operations expects that will change by next year, when a wave of privatizations and ongoing free-market reforms make it worthwhile to carry a cellular phone and boost prospects for his bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of basic trends going on in Brazil that affect us in a positive way,&quot; said Gutierrez, who is also J.P. Morgan's managing director for the four-nation Mercosur regional customs union. &quot;We expect some of these trends to grow and intensify.&quot;</p>
<p>Gutierrez foresees a slew of privatizations, mergers, acquisitions and direct investment as the country solidifies its recovery from years of economic instability. That is good news for J.P. Morgan.  </p>
<p>The U.S.-based investment bank, a leader in advising and underwriting mergers and acquisitions in Brazil, expects to post a $68-million operating profit this year, up from $53.2 million in 1995. The Brazil unit acted as advisor or underwriter in seven mergers and acquisitions in 1996.</p>
<p>Gutierrez declined to give an earnings projection for next year but said J.P. Morgan Brazil expects 1997 profits to top this year's.  </p>
<p>Behind the bright outlook are prospects for continued low inflation, a growing need for financing by local and foreign firms, a host of privatizations and progress in cutting the fiscal account deficit, he said.</p>
<p>The country, now in the process of reforming and opening its economy after years of hyperinflation and statism, is apt to maintain its current &quot;positive business climate&quot; through the coming year, he added.</p>
<p>Economic changes underway in Brazil favor J.P. Morgan, he said, adding he sees the trend &quot;continuing for at least the next two years.&quot;  </p>
<p>But potential problems loom. Among them are high interest rates, relatively slow growth, stubbornly high business costs and swelling trade and current account deficits.</p>
<p>&quot;Export growth is not what one would want,&quot; Gutierrez said. &quot;The exchange rate is one factor but that cannot compensate for some of the underlying issues.&quot;</p>
<p>The main fundamental problem for Brazil's economy continues to be its combination of tight monetary policy with a loose grip on fiscal accounts, which has slashed inflation but resulted in high real interest rates and sluggish growth.  </p>
<p>Gutierrez said J.P. Morgan forecasts gross domestic product growth of three percent to four percent. But he added: &quot;Brazil should be able to grow easily four to six percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monetary policy is putting pressure on producers to produce in a cost-efficient manner but there's a time factor here,&quot; he said. &quot;After a while, you won't be able to squeeze any more productivity out of the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Brasilia could maintain its current policy for no more than a year or two without bringing the economy to a standstill.  </p>
<p>Gutierrez said he does not feel the success of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's bid to stand for re-election in 1998 will be crucial to government efforts to pass fiscal, pension and administrative reforms through Congress.</p>
<p>But he said progress on the fiscal acocunts will be gradual rather than &quot;overnight.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, J.P. Morgan is upbeat about 1997 due to expected government progress in reining in fiscal accounts, the growing need of companies for capitalization, investment and divestiture and the rash of scheduled privatizations.</p>
<p>The bank is watching especially closely the sell-offs of state mining, power and telecoms firms, Gutierrez said. &quot;From the market's point of view, 1997 and 1998 will be the years for these three sectors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gutierrez, calling Brazil's economy the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of Mercosur, said the country is &quot;the last major telecoms market that remains to be privatized.&quot;</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan advised the winning bidder in last week's sale of a strategic stake in Brazilian state-owned CRT, he said.</p>
