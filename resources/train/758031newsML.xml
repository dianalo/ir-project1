<p>French pharmaceuticals and chemicals company Rhone-Poulenc SA said on Friday its net income for the first half of the year increased by 14 percent to 1.608 billion francs ($260.2 million) from 1.41 billion and maintained its forecast of a rise in 20 percent for the 1997 earnings per share.</p>
<p>&quot;The second quarter has confirmed the continued growth in the group's results. We are therefore maintaining our objective of increasing earnings per share by 20 percent in 1997, excluding exceptional items,&quot; chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said in a statement.</p>
<p>Financial analysts had expected a first half net income figure in the range of 1.48 to 1.6 billion francs.</p>
<p>The second quarter net income was 20.2 percent higher at 934 million on 5.8 percent higher sales at 23.435 billion. The sales increase was boosted by the rise in the dollar and the increase would have been 3.3 percent at comparable exchange rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Excluding Centeon, the increase in net income would have been 43 percent,&quot; the company said, referring to a blood plasm joint-venture with Hoechst which had to recall some albumin products and only recently resumed operations.</p>
<p>Operating income at pharmaceuticals, mainly in the 68.6 percent Rhone-Poulenc Rorer subsidiary, was up to 1.820 billion francs on the first half from 1.367 billion and would have increased to 1.983 billion if not for the Centeon impact.</p>
<p>Operating income at chemicals for the six months rose to 708 million from 591 million, animal and plant health increased to 1.740 billion from 1.625 billion while fibres and polymers jumped to 242 million from 197 million.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc said this increase was established despite a depressed polyester market and continued low prices. ($ = 6.179 French Francs)</p>
