<p>By ending survival plan talks without the support of two big unions, Canadian Airlines Corp Chief Executive Kevin Benson is gambling the holdouts will blink before the deal unravels.</p>
<p>The Canadian Auto Workers and Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represent 6,300 of the ailing carrier's 16,400 employees, remained opposed on Thursday to Canadian's revamped life-support plan, despite its approval by the company, three governments and four other unions.</p>
<p>Support in the next few days from CAW and CUPE was seen as critical to the success of the C$180 million-($135 million)-a- year survival strategy because the governments of Canada, British Columbia and Alberta said they would abandon their contributions without it.</p>
<p>As promised, Benson slammed the door on negotiations over the company's restructuring at 0300 EST/0800 GMT today after 10 days of intense talks in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The round-the-clock discussions yielded a complex prescription for averting the carrier's demise, which included the three governments providing C$35 million ($26 million) in tax breaks and loan payment extensions, and employees taking sliding-scale wage cuts averaging five percent, with lower earners absorbing no reductions.</p>
<p>If successful, the government and employee contributions would yield annual savings of C$70 million ($53 million).</p>
<p>That, when added to savings from route restructurings and a C$48 million ($36 million) cut in computer and management fees paid to 33 percent owner AMR Corp., would pull Canadian from the brink of financial collapse, the company has said.</p>
<p>&quot;The clear message from many employees is that they support this plan, particularly with government involvement,&quot; Benson said. &quot;I appeal to the CAW and CUPE to join us by asking their members for a ratification vote.&quot;</p>
<p>Airline analysts said that Benson, by ending the talks, aimed to get breathing room by allowing support for the plan to grow among the unions' nervous rank and file.</p>
<p>Benson had been scheduled to present a consolidated plan on Saturday to creditors and suppliers, which include several banks, lessors of most of its aircraft fleet, oil companies and airport landlords.</p>
<p>CUPE President Judy Darcy said her union, which represents flight attendants, had always planned to put the proposal to a vote, but was attempting to raise the wage level under which cuts would be avoided to C$30,000 ($23,000) a year from C$23,000 ($17,000). That was rejected early Thursday by Canadian.</p>
<p>&quot;We're saying C$30,000 per year is hardly a fat-cat salary. These are mainly women. A whole lot of them are single parents and they've taken hits year after year,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The CAW maintained its position that wages were not the cause of Canadian's chronic losses.</p>
<p>The CAW has called for a government bailout and re-regulation of Canada's domestic airline industry was the solution to Canadian's woes.</p>
<p>The union said it planned to hold meetings across Canada to inform members of the most recent developments in the crisis, but unlike CUPE would not agree to ask members to vote.</p>
