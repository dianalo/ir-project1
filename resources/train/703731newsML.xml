<p>Thai overnight interbank rates were unquoted on Wednesday morning after the baht was alllowed to float, dealers said.</p>
<p>Banks were unwilling to lend following the baht adjustment and were waiting for developments before they resumed lending.</p>
<p>&quot;The interbank rate is not even being quoted. The only interday financing we are offering is to our corporate customers and that is on a case by case basis,&quot; said a dealer at a local bank. &quot;I think we should get a clearer picture of where we want to be after the central bank sets the reference rate tonight.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand said it would set a reference rate for the baht based on a average of previous day trades. The baht was previously allowed to trade in a narrow range and pegged to a basket of currencies dominated by the U.S dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;We have advised our clients that if they can avoid doing anything today then waiting would be better because it's going to very expensive,&quot; said another local dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;No one in the market is lending this morning. I mean we have to say something but it's a figure we are setting ourselves, something over 20 percent,&quot; said a dealer at medium-sized bank.  </p>
<p>The baht was trading between around 27.00/29.00 per dollar by 0400 GMT from 25.80/25.90 on Monday when the currency was pegged. The market was closed on Tuesday for a holiday.</p>
<p>Offshore the baht was trading at 27.00/29.00 per dollar against 24.80/25.20 on Monday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand has pledged to maintain currency controls which had cut off baht supply to offshore speculators.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will probably end up at somewhere around 30 but it's just so volatile it's hard to say,&quot; said one local dealer.</p>
<p>Traders said they were surprised by the timing of the float.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm absolutely speechless,&quot; the local dealer said.</p>
