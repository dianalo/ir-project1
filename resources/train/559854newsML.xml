<p>Most U.S. debt futures closed with tepid gains, as the surge in U.S. stock prices failed to drum up any enthusiasm in the U.S. T-bond and Eurodollar pits, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>June T-bonds edged above the 110-00 level, but found little of the fanfare that swept through the U.S. stock market. Volume was mediocre in the U.S. T-bond futures market, totaling an estimated 170,000 contracts, one trader said.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to record high above the 7,200 level, while June Standard &amp; Poor's 500 set an all-time high of 837.50.  </p>
<p>U.S. bonds and Eurodollar futures languished for most of the day in consolidative-type trade. Both markets had little reaction to the U.S. March housing completions data.</p>
<p>U.S. March housing completions fell 10.4 percent to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.40 million against February's completions which were revised to an annual rate of 1.563 million, from 1.505 million as originally reported.</p>
<p>The market will have more U.S. economic data to mull over on Tuesday, as two weekly retail reports, coupled wtih March factory orders will be released. Orders are seen falling 1.5 percent, from February's rise of 0.8 percent.  </p>
<p>June T-bonds mustered enough energy to pop above 110-00 with U.S. stocks' rally.</p>
<p>&quot;It was constructive,&quot; one floor trader said about the June bond's late move. &quot;It's not doing anything for the bears' case.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, June T-bonds were up 04/32 at 110-01/32, 10-year notes were up 01/32 at 107-09, September T-bills were flat at 94.47, September and December Eurodollars were also unchanged at 93.885 and 93.68, respectively, and June munibonds were up 06/32 at 115-04/32.
