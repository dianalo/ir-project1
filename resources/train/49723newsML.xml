<title>USA: Algerian rebels urge referendum on army.</title>
<headline>Algerian rebels urge referendum on army.</headline>

<p>Algeria's chief Islamic opposition party in exile called on Thurday for a referendum on the army's role as a step toward ending civil strife that threatens the stability of southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>The outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) said its jailed president would urge Islamic guerrillas to observe a ceasefire if military-backed authorities agreed to a vote.</p>
<p>In an open letter to the &quot;military/security establishment of Algeria&quot; released at a news conference in Washington, FIS said the referendum should simply ask, &quot;Do you accept the interference of the army in politics: Yes or No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If this proposal is accepted, the FIS can assure the Algerian people the Mujahedin (warriors) loyal to the original line of the Jihad (holy war) and of the FIS will not reject an appeal for a ceasefire ... in order to allow the organisation of the referendum,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Anwar Haddam, president of the FIS parliamentary delegation abroad, said the group's imprisoned president, Abbassi Madani, would call for such a ceasefire if Algerian authorities let the proposed referendum take place.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always been ready to do that if the military accepts a real political solution. It is the military who have always tried to avoid the main issue,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people may have died in Algeria's political violence since a 1992 military coup foiled a likely FIS victory in parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>The open letter coincided with Algerian government preparations for a weekend political conference that would chart reforms without the participation of radical Islamists.</p>
