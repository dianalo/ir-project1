<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said the Franco-German motor behind European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was in good order and complained it was being portrayed too negatively.</p>
<p>In an interview with the General Anzeiger newspaper released ahead of publication on Wednesday, Kinkel said the two countries remained at the heart of efforts toward European integration despite recent differences.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin are to meet later this month in Bonn to clear the air in relations in what could be a decisive step on the road to a single European currency.</p>
<p>Commentators say relations between Bonn and Paris have deteriorated since the election victory for France's Socialists in June.</p>
<p>&quot;We must fight this image. You can talk -- or write -- yourself into a crisis,&quot; Kinkel said. &quot;Bonn and Paris know they are in emotional and rational terms the most important partners. That's how it is and that's how it's staying.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinkel declined to be drawn into speculation about France's chances of fulfilling a key criterion of entry to EMU -- that its budget deficit not exceed three percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Analysts say those chances are looking increasingly slim.</p>
<p>But he reiterated Bonn's position that France was doing its best to put its finances in order to qualify for the 1999 launch of Europe's planned single currency, the euro.</p>
<p>Kohl and Jospin meet on August 28 in Bonn to try to overcome strains between two countries, which pride themselves on working together as the motor of European integration.</p>
<p>The French left's election victory on June 1 has raised doubts about Paris' willingness to make more budget sacrifices for the euro.</p>
<p>France and Germany differed over adding a chapter on employment to the Maastricht Treaty at the June EU summit, but Kinkel said the conflict could have been much worse if they had not sought to minimise difficulties.</p>
<p>&quot;The new French government promised in its election campaign to launch a state funding programme for employment policies,&quot; Kinkel said.</p>
<p>Bonn sought a compromise in the end by agreeing to add the jobs chapter but rejected extra spending on job-creation schemes.</p>
<p>&quot;We tried to minimise a potentially big confrontation. We did the best we could in Amsterdam,&quot; Kinkel said. REUTER</p>
