<title>ALBANIA: Seven hurt in Albania election rally clash.</title>
<headline>Seven hurt in Albania election rally clash.</headline>

<p>Seven people were injured, two seriously, in shooting on the sidelines of an election rally staged by Albanian President Sali Berisha in the central town of Elbasan on Thursday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>A local journalist and a nurse at the town hospital said by telephone that security guards shot at residents after an angry group protested at the guards' presence in the town, about 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Tirana.</p>
<p>Berisha left the town under escort and an official at his office later said he had arrived safely in the capital. The wounded were a security guard and six local people, including two policemen, the nurse said.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry said in a statement four citizens and two policemen were wounded in the incident but their lives were not in danger. It made no mention of any security guards.</p>
<p>The ministry said the incident started when about four people shot automatic weapons at the crowd from 500-600 metres (yards) away, and nearby police returned fire.</p>
<p>The local journalist said he believed Berisha's convoy had come under fire on the road out, and that he had seen two of the president's aides take refuge in the city hall.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Berisha was addressing a small crowd near the town's hotel to present his Democratic Party's candidate for the country's parliamentary elections later this month.</p>
<p>Elbasan is about 20 km (12 miles) east of the town of Cerrik, where six Republican guardsmen, whose duty is to protect top officials, were killed in a gunfight last month as they tried to regain control of a police station.</p>
<p>Tensions have been mounting as Albania heads for the June 29 poll in a bid to restore calm after lawlessness and violence erupted when fraudulent savings schemes collapsed earlier this year.</p>
