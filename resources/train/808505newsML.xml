<p>China's Zhejiang Expressway Co Ltd said on Tuesday it is confident of achieving its earnings forecast for 1997 despite the construction of two interchanges affecting traffic volume of its Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident about achieving the profit forecast set in the prospectus by increasing income and reducing costs through various channels,&quot; chairman Geng Xiaoping told a telephone conference.</p>
<p>It posted an interim net profit of HK$125.23 million ($16.17 million) for 1997 against its annual profit forecast before extraordinary items of not less than 200 million yuan (HK$186.90).</p>
<p>&quot;Profitability shall be increased by providing ancillary facilities, for example, car maintenance and petrol stations, shops, restaurants, and billboard advertising along the expressway,&quot; Geng said.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou city government was spending about 200 million yuan to build two interchanges and elevated bridges along the Hangzhou city junction of the expressway to ease congestion.</p>
<p>Geng said the construction, which started in June and will be completed in end-November, would take away a maximum of seven to eight percent of the company's revenue in the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;After the completion of the interchanges, the congestion problem will be fundamentally solved and is expect to greatly lift our traffic volume,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Expressway, representing the Zhejiang provincial government's main vehicle for expressway development, wholly owns and operates the Hanzhou-Ningbo Expressway.</p>
<p>The company was also actively reviewing the feasibility of investment in the Huzhou section of the Hangzhou-Nanjing Expressway and the Shangyu-Sanmen Road as disclosed in the prospectus, the chairman said.</p>
<p>Wilbur Smith Associates Ltd has been appointed as traffic and engineering consultants to conduct a study on the traffic flow and construction costs of the projects.</p>
<p>&quot;If the result of the study shows an internal rate of return of 20 percent or above, the company will consider implementing the proposed investment in the second half of 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The chairman said the investment sum in the two projects had not been finalised yet.</p>
<p>But Geng said the city's transport department had approved the total investment of the 35-km long Huzhou section at about 1.222 billion yuan and the 142 km long Shanyu-Sanmen highway was expected to cost about 4.2 billion yuan to build.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally speaking we aim for a controlling stake in the projects,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Expressway raised a total of about 3.524 billion yuan from a H-share flotation in May.</p>
<p>The company had used 270 million yuan to repay bank loans and the balance was placed on short-term deposit in banks or invested in treasury bonds, Geng said.</p>
