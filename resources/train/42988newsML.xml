<p>Orders received by U.S. semiconductor makers rose in August from July, causing the industry's leading indicator to rise slightly, a trade group said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Semiconductor Industry Association said the industry's book-to-bill ratio rose to 0.90 in August from a revised July ratio of 0.86.</p>
<p>The index means that for every $100 in shipments last month, semiconductor firms received $90 in new orders. An index above 1.00 normally means demand for computer chips is expanding while a ratio below one means demand is slowing.</p>
<p>Industry analysts had expected the ratio to be between 0.86 and 0.92. The July ratio was revised slightly from 0.85.</p>
<p>The SIA said new orders rose 0.9 percent last month to $2.84 billion from $2.82 billion in July. The gain was offset by a continuing decline in billings, which fell 3.2 percent to $3.15 billion in August from $3.26 billion in July.</p>
<p>Compared with last year's levels, August chip orders were off 37.8 percent and billings were down 19.9 percent. The book-to-bill ratio in August 1995 was 1.16.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that the gain in orders from July to August was a positive development for the troubled semiconductor industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Given that you've got this going on during the summer, it is a pretty good sign that things are finally starting to improve,&quot; said semiconductor analyst Dan Niles of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.</p>
<p>He and other analysts said the report gives reason to be optimistic about the industry and they expected stock market gains by semiconductor makers on Thursday.</p>
<p>August and July are normally the slowest months of the year in the semiconductor industry and indeed August orders were below orders received in some of the spring months.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally orders don't go up in August,&quot; said Mark Edelstone of Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The only reason that orders  would go up in face of significant pressure in the DRAM market is because the inventory correction is ending and PC (personal computer) orders are accelerating,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Edelstone said while the ratio itself was a number he expected, he viewed SIA's reports on conditions in Europe as very good news.</p>
<p>&quot;You really have to look at this on a global basis. That the European book-to-bill is at 0.99 is phenomenal,&quot; he said. The indicator in Europe rebounded from a book to bill of 0.83 as recently as June.</p>
<p>SIA spokesman Jeff Weir said August orders were the first month-to-month gain all year but because the numbers were preliminary that could change when it reports more solid August numbers in its September report.</p>
<p>Ealier this year, the SIA reported a month-to-month gain in orders that was later revised as a drop.</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry has been hurt this year by a glut in computer chips, particularly in the memory market. In recent months a number of semiconductor makers have scaled back expansion plans or halted construction of new wafer plants until the market improves.</p>
<p>Analysts say August is usually the weakest month of the year because many manufacturers shut down for vacation. Thus, an increase in orders during August could signal the beginning of a cyclical upturn.</p>
<p>The last two weeks of September are when PC makers start shipping their products for the holiday season, and most of them order semiconductors &quot;just-in-time,&quot; often only days before they are scheduled for the assembly line.</p>
<p>The SIA said book-to-bill numbers in the other major market sectors -- Japan, Asia and Europe -- remain higher than in the North and South American market. The final worldwide book-to-bill ratio for July, the latest period available, rose to 0.95 from 0.93 in June. Japan's book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1.02 in July.</p>
