<p>At least 15 people died and 57 were injured when two powerful bombs exploded at a crowded bus station in this city in northern India's Jammu and Kashmir state, police said.</p>
<p>The bombs went off just as several senior Jammu and Kashmir officials were driving along a street on the other side of the bus station towards a stadium a kilometre (half a mile) away to attend a concert.</p>
<p>Police said none of the government officials was injured.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said the first bomb, at about 6:40 p.m. (1310 GMT) exploded near a tourist bus waiting to depart for Delhi, 500 km (300 miles) to the south. A second blast a few minutes later badly damaged two other buses parked nearby.</p>
<p>There was no immediate word on who was responsible for the blasts, which occurred on the second day of crucial talks between senior Indian and Pakistani diplomats in New Delhi, the first in three years between the bitter rivals.</p>
<p>Eight people in the gutted tourist bus were killed instantly in the blast and the rest died on the way to hospital, police said.</p>
<p>Gyan Chand, whose older brother died in the blast, said he had just stepped away from the bus to make a telephone call. &quot;There was a huge blast followed by a fire,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>An angry crowd gathered at the spot and hurled stones at police and emergency workers who rushed to the site, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Police told Reuters several women and children were among the injured and 20 people were in serious condition.</p>
<p>Most of the injured were taken to the Government Medical College in the city, the predominantly Hindu winter capital of India's Moslem-majority Jammu and Kashmir state.</p>
<p>A large crowd gathered outside the hospital to identify the victims. Police cordoned off the hospital.</p>
<p>Telephone lines to and out of Jammu city were disrupted but it was not immediately clear if they had been damaged by the blasts.</p>
<p>The last round of India-Pakistan talks collapsed in January 1994 over Kashmir, where a separatist Moslem revolt has been raging since 1980 in the part of the Himalayan region controlled by India. Pakistan rules one-third of Kashmir and India the rest.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in Kashmir since the start of an armed revolt there in January 1990.</p>
<p>Hindu migrants from Kashmir staged noisy protests in New Delhi on Saturday against last week's killings of seven members of their community by unidentified gunmen, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Twelve Hindu families left their homes in the Moslem-dominated Kashmir Valley on Friday and arrived in Jammu, where they told reporters they feared for their lives after the killings in Sangrampur, a village in Budgam district.</p>
