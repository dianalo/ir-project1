<p>British television watchdogs on Monday rejected complaints by viewers that an election broadcast by the Conservative Party before this month's election was misleading and unfair.</p>
<p>The Independent Television Commission (ITC) said it had received 13 written complaints about a broadcast which depicted a grim future under a Labour government.</p>
<p>The Labour Party scored a landslide election victory on May 1 over the Conservatives, who had been in power for 18 years.</p>
<p>&quot;The broadcast itself made clear to viewers both visually and audibly that it was no more than an imaginary, if partisan, look into the future,&quot; the ITC said in its monthly report.</p>
<p>The ITC said it upheld complaints about two editions of the satirical series &quot;Brass Eye&quot; on Channel 4, including the February 5 edition concerning a spoof anti-drug campaign about a bogus drug called &quot;cake&quot; and the February 19 edition about the television treatment of sexual behaviour.</p>
<p>The ITC said it upheld complaints filed by two members of parliament who made statements on the February 5 episode supporting the spoof anti-drug campaign. The ITC ruled that neither of the two MPs was adequately informed about the format, subject matter and purpose of the programme.</p>
<p>The ITC said the February 19 edition breached codes on taste and decency and agreed with viewers who complained that aspects of the programme made it inappropriate for transmission as early as 9:30 p.m.</p>
<p>But the ITC found no overall fault with &quot;Brass Eye&quot;. &quot;The commission found the series in general amusing and innovative and had no criticism of the overall programme concept,&quot; the ITC said.</p>
<p>In addition, the ITC said episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; broadcast on ITV did not breach programme codes, although 32 viewers complained about the level of violence in scenes showing a family being held at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Some viewers complained the episodes were broadcast the week of the first anniversary of a shooting tragedy in Dunblane in Scotland when a gunman massacred 16 children and their teacher in a school.</p>
<p>But the ITC said the episodes did not breach programme codes and were sufficiently distant from Dunblane not to cause general offence.</p>
