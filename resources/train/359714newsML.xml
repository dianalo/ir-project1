<p>British children, already showing what many parents and doctors think is an unhealthy obsession with being thin, think it's even more important to have a suntan, a poll published on Thursday has found.</p>
<p>A poll commissioned for the Cancer Research Campaign charity found that that 58 percent of eight to 10-year-olds surveyed thought people looked better with a tan.</p>
<p>Only 41 percent said they thought being thin was attractive.</p>
<p>The MORI poll of 413 children found children in the cooler north of Britain were more likely to value a tan. Most dermatologists say any kind of a tan indicates skin has been damaged by the sun and say seeking a tan is dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless attitudes change, skin cancer could overtake anorexia as the biggest new threat to our children in the next decades,&quot; said Gordon McVie, the charity's director-general.</p>
<p>&quot;Our survey shows that 40 percent of the young children we spoke to have already been burned at least once. And of those, around a quarter said that they had been sunburned on at least three separate occasions,&quot; McVie added.</p>
<p>&quot;Experts believe that it takes only six bouts of sunburn during a lifetime to double the risk of developing skin cancer.&quot;</p>
