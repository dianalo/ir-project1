<p>European Union industry ministers agreed after lengthy talks on Thursday to spend 127 million European currency units ($161 million) over the next four years to help small firms grow and create needed jobs in the bloc.</p>
<p>The Third Multiannual Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to run from 1997 to 2000, was part of the European Commission's campaign to cut a jobless rate of nearly 11 percent in the EU.</p>
<p>But the Commission, smarting from earlier setbacks in its efforts to create jobs, had its original budget proposal scaled down by ministers.</p>
<p>The Commission had proposed a budget of 180 million Ecus, of which 40 million would come from re-allocating funds within the EU budget.</p>
<p>This would have been an increase of 60 percent over the 112 million Ecus for the previous four years. But countries including Germany, Sweden, Britain and the Netherlands strongly objected.</p>
<p>A spokesman said EU Commissioner Christos Papoutsis, who is responsible for SMEs, was satisfied that there was an agreement even though he was not happy with the amount of money.</p>
<p>He said Papoutsis may return with a proposal to boost the budget if there was a wider agreement on re-allocating funds within the bloc's budget.</p>
<p>The programme includes a series of measures aimed at boosting the development and competitiveness of SMEs, which account for 99.8 percent of all companies and 66 percent of employment in the EU.</p>
<p>It proposes steps to reduce their administrative burden, give them better access to loans and other financing, improve the flow of information, encourage the training of managers and support women and young entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The plan was part of Commission President Jacques Santer's confidence pact for employment which has run into much opposition from EU finance mininisters reluctant to spend money while they are desperately trying to meet criteria for monetary union.</p>
<p>The Commission had proposed revising the EU budget's financial ceiling so that money from the farm budget could be used to create employment, mainly through the major trans- European network projects but also through SMEs and research. ($1=0.79 Ecu)</p>
