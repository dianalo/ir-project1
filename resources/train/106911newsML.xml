<p>Stronger oil prices have showered the United Arab Emirates with extra petrodollars which will further stimulate the already-robust economy.</p>
<p>But analysts say the Gulf state is already hard pressed to soak up abundant private liquidity.</p>
<p>They expect 1996 real economic growth of between 1.5 and two percent, little changed from last year. This trend is seen continuing next year, after a brief pause around end-1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Just look around, the cranes are still up and buildings are being torn down,&quot; said a banker, referring to the construction industry which has boomed since the Gulf War and contributes about 14 percent to the UAE's gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>But analysts say a current mass exodus of as many as 200,000 foreign workers, or almost 10 percent of the population, will send a negative ripple through the economy in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic activity will be slowing in the last quarter of this year and (first quarter) next year. The exodus of workers will slow down construction and many contractors may have to postpone projects and prices will go up,&quot; said an economist.</p>
<p>The illegal foreign workers, many of them manual labourers from the Indian subcontinent, are scrambling to leave the UAE under a government amnesty which gives them until October 31 to get their papers in order or get out.</p>
<p>But government finances are set to be healthier, nourished by stronger oil prices, which recently reached their highest level since the Gulf War, yielding a windfall to state coffers.</p>
<p>Mohammed al-Asoomi, head of economic research at the Emirates Industrial Bank, estimated the UAE would this year enjoy a 10 to 12 percent increase in oil revenue over last year's $9 billion, helping it to tackle its budget deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The deficit will be lower than last year and it may even be wiped out because of the higher oil prices. Higher oil revenues will mean larger government expenditure which will stimulate the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government had projected spending of 18.25 billion dirhams ($4.97 billion) and revenue of 17.40 billion in its 1996 federal budget. Bankers estimate the budget represents only about a third of consolidated government spending of the seven emirates, but it is nevertheless important as a barometer.</p>
<p>A Western commercial attache estimated the UAE -- a major OPEC producer with a 2.16 million barrels per day quota -- had in the past 90 days reaped about $1 billion more than it had expected this year thanks to the oil price rally.</p>
<p>But in the absence of a formal stock market in the state- dominated economy, cash-rich UAE citizens are forced to look abroad for lucrative investment opportunities, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;The struggle in economic terms is do we or don't we privatise? That debate will gather pace in the next 12 months,&quot; said a Western diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;The sheikhs say if we don't need the money why should we give away the assets. The indigenous population would like to invest but there is nothing to invest in. They need to privatise ...to mop up private liquidity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Like its Gulf Arab neighbours, the UAE is trying to diversify its oil-driven economy and find more channels for foreign and private investment. Full foreign ownership of companies is so far mainly limited to the country's free zones -- dominated by the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai.</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi also has ambitious plans for a free trade zone.</p>
<p>The UAE plans to privatise electricity and water utilities but the process is not expected to start for some time.</p>
<p>It is expected to launch a long-awaited formal stock exchange in 1997 but analysts say it will not flourish without opening to foreigners and imposing tight regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade on the unofficial stock exchange is petty compared with the amount of money available,&quot; said an analyst, of the bourse with capitalisation of around $12.5 billion.</p>
<p>Three firms have been floated so far this year and the response shows that investors are eager to put their money to work. When Al-Khazna Insurance Co was recently launched, investors subscribed for more than seven times the 2.09 million shares on offer. ($1=3.67 dirhams)</p>
