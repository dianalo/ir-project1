<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said Italy's bourse watchdog Consob had opened a preliminary enquiry into reports of alleged insider trading in shares in yellow pages telephone directory group SEAT SpA.</p>
<p>Ciampi told the lower house of parliament that the Treasury had asked Consob for information after media allegations of insider trading at Lehman Brothers, financial consultants in the planned sale of the Treasury's majority stake in the company.</p>
<p>He said Lehman Brothers had denied the reports and announced it would take legal action against the newspapers concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as the allegations of insider trading by Lehman appeared in print, the Treasury asked Consob for information and at the moment a preliminary enquiry has been opened,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ciampi said that Lehman Brothers had denied all accusations against them as completely unfounded and stressed that they had never dealt with SEAT shares on their own account during the period since they were appointed to handle the sale.</p>
<p>He said the preliminary enquiry was &quot;a legal requirement whenever there are indications from savers or the media&quot;.</p>
<p>The Treasury in February asked Lehman Brothers to proceed with the final phase of its operation to privatise SEAT.</p>
<p>SEAT was split off from state-controlled telecoms group Stet at the beginning of this year. The Treasury took over state industrial holding IRI's stake of around 61 percent.</p>
<p>Ciampi said last week that due diligence on SEAT would be by April 16 and its sale would be carried out by mid-June.</p>
<p>In February, ITT Corp said it was seeking along with other partners to acquire SEAT. IRI has said it has received eight non-binding offers for SEAT.</p>
