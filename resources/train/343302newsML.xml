<headline>UK's Labour calls for passports for HK Asians.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's opposition Labour party on Thursday called on the government to drop its opposition to a bill giving full British citizenship to 8,000 mainly Asian residents of Hong Kong after it is handed over to China in July.</p>
<p>The 8,000, most of them of South Asian descent, say they will effectively be left stateless after the July 1 handover as Chinese citizenship is based on ethnic criteria and Britain is denying them full citizenship.</p>
<p>Instead, they are being offered the status of British overseas citizens or nationals, which allows them to travel on British-issued passports but gives no right to live in Britain.</p>
<p>A bill to change this, drawn up by a peer, Lord Willoughby de Broke, is going through the British parliament. But Prime Minister John Major's government opposes it and without official backing it stands no chance of becoming law.</p>
<p>Labour's home affairs spokesman Jack Straw made his plea for a change of heart in a letter sent to Home Secretary Michael Howard on Thursday and released to the media.</p>
<p>Straw said: &quot;Common sense and common humanity demand that we give these people full British citizenship.</p>
<p>&quot;The limbo in which they will find themselves in July arises directly from the agreements which Britain made with China.&quot;</p>
<p>Home Office officials were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Britain cedes sovereignty of its last Asian outpost at midnight on June 30, 1997. Under a joint declaration signed in 1984, China is required to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist freedoms and way of life intact for 50 years.</p>
<p>But the two sides are currently at odds over democratic reforms introduced in the final years of British rule.</p>
<p>China has unveiled plans to dilute Hong Kong's laws guaranteeing civil liberties, including a Bill of Rights, sparking outrage in Hong Kong and objections from London.</p>
