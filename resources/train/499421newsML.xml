<p>Politicians in Russia's Far Eastern Primorye region have urged the government and parliament to halt plans to give China a sliver of land under a border demarcation deal, Interfax news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Deputies in the local parliament also backed a local initative to hold a referendum on whether to give up the land and said the treaty was damaging Russia's stategic interests in the Far East.</p>
<p>The new border, agreed in 1991, will give China access to the sea just south of the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok.</p>
<p>But there has been tough opposition in the region, which is far closer to Japan than to Moscow and local officials said last year they had stopped work on demarcating the new frontier. Moscow denied that this was the case.</p>
<p>The Primorye parliament approved its resolution days before a trip to Moscow by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>Jiang is expected to sign a pact on cutting border troop numbers with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and with the heads of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>Russia is trying to improve relations with China after border clashes in the 1960s. Most border disputes were resolved in 1991 and Yeltsin promised to finalise the issue this year.</p>
