<p>A human tide of Hutu refugees returned to their homeland Rwanda from war-torn eastern Zaire on Saturday and harassed aid workers said they had stopped trying to estimate the numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pointless trying to count them. It's endless and we are running out of space every second,&quot; said a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p>In vain, he tried to direct the refugees into the Petite Barriere transit camp one km (half-a-mile) from the Rwandan border crossing of the same name, manned by four bored soldiers.</p>
<p>Behind him a long, thick phalanx of refugees stretched into the distance, deep into Zaire, as far as the eye could see. Five-abreast, it moved silently across the horizon and into Rwanda.</p>
<p>Aid workers, unable to cope with the sheer size of the influx, said it was impossible to give an accurate estimate of the numbers of people who have already crossed back into the homeland they fled in panic in 1994.</p>
<p>But in Nairobi a spokesperson for the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) said an estimated 80,000 were now in Rwanda after having crossed all through the night.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, put the number at 100,000 and said a further 300,000 were waiting to cross.</p>
<p>The refugees started the short trek back to Rwanda on Friday after Zairean rebels broke the hold over them of ex-Rwandan soldiers and Interahamwe militiamen responsible for the 1994 genocide of up to one million people, mostly Tutsis.</p>
<p>Surrounded by thousands of fellow returnees, Martin Habyarimana said they wanted food.</p>
<p>&quot;We left Mugunga camp yesterday (Friday) because we wanted to return to our country and there was no security in Mugunga. So far I have seen that it is safe here and I am not afraid of the RPF (Rwandan Patriotic Front),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hutus fled the RPF victory, which ended the genocide, fearing they would be killed in a reprisal slaughter.</p>
<p>Habyarimana, who like others had simply retraced the same steps he took when he fled across the border, said the refugees had changed their minds because they realised Rwanda was safer than the camp under attack.</p>
<p>The Zairean rebels, made up of Banyamulenge Tutsis and other opponents of ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, have close links with Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.</p>
<p>&quot;The Interahamwe told us in Rwanda there was no security so everyone was frightened but they have left and the rebels will chase them until even they are forced to come back,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old music teacher from the capital Kigali said the refugees had wasted two years by staying in Zaire, but said they were afraid to leave because they believed the Zairean army would rob them even if they escaped the Interahamwe.</p>
<p>&quot;They (rebels) pushed us back and we had to come here to save our lives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Others said the Hutus decided to return because they were fed up with the harsh conditions of exile.</p>
<p>&quot;The people decided to come back because they are tired, hungry and fed up,&quot; said Maurice Nsengrenwe, a 31-year-old former seminary student.</p>
<p>He said some Interahamwe stayed in Mugunga when he left on Friday, but were unable to stop the refugees heading towards Goma because they were being hunted by rebels.</p>
<p>Rwandan aid workers met the refugees as they crossed at the border shouting through loud speakers to be careful not to lose their children. Thousands were lost on the last march.</p>
<p>Soldiers at the border just stood with the gate open and watched the refugees return.</p>
