<p>Sri Lanka's army is planning more thrusts against Tamil Tiger guerrillas in their northern jungle stronghold, a newspaper on Wednesday quoted the army chief as saying.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Rohan Daluwatte told the independent Island newspaper that troops were busy re-establishing a base at Kilinochchi, a key town 285 km (178 miles) north of the capital of Colombo captured from Tamil rebels at the weekend.</p>
<p>The army will mount more operations against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) bases in the northern Wanni jungles in coming weeks, Daluwatte said without elaborating.</p>
<p>&quot;If our soldiers could have recaptured the Jaffna peninsula and Kilinochchi from the Tigers, I do not think it would be difficult to recapture the Wanni in full along with Tiger bases,&quot; he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Military officials said the rebels had fallen back to their jungle bases in the northern mainland Wanni region that is largely under Tiger control.</p>
<p>But a rebel statement said fighting was still raging in Kilinochchi nearly three days after government troops, backed by tanks, artillery and air support, seized the town.</p>
<p>&quot;Both in Kilinochchi town and its suburbs, heavy clashes between the LTTE forces and Sri Lankan armed forces are continuing,&quot; an LTTE statement, faxed to Reuters on Wednesday, said.</p>
<p>The military, however, denied the rebel claim.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not correct, because we went into the town on Sunday afternoon and we haven't sighted (the rebels) since then,&quot; a military spokesman said. &quot;Sporadic mortar fire is the closest we've come to them since.&quot;</p>
<p>The army lost 269 soldiers in the offensive, with more than 700 rebels killed and over 800 wounded, the military said. About 300 soldiers were wounded.</p>
<p>The LTTE said on Sunday that 90 of its fighters had died. With reporters banned from the war zone, no independent verification is possible.</p>
<p>The Tigers set up base in Kilinochchi in April after the army captured Jaffna, 300 km (188 miles) north of Colombo, in a series of offensives.</p>
<p>The rebels, fighting a 13-year-old war for an independent Tamil homeland in the Indian Ocean island's north and east, had ruled Jaffna for almost a decade with their own administration, courts and police.</p>
<p>A military spokesman said troops were consolidating their positions and clearing mines and boobytraps in Kilinochchi, which was empty of civilians.</p>
<p>The town's population of some 200,000 minority Tamils fled to safer areas, mostly in the south where Western aid agencies operate temporary shelters, aid workers said.</p>
<p>Daluwatte was quoted as saying that the army will help restore civil administration for the returning refugees.</p>
<p>Troops recovered arms and explosives abandoned by the rebels when they withdrew from Kilinochchi, he added.</p>
<p>The government has said more than 50,000 people have died in the ethnic war.</p>
