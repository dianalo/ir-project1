<p>A federal jury convicted Tyson Foods lobbyist Jack Williams Friday of two counts of lying during an investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.</p>
<p>Jurors returned the guilty verdict after about three hours of deliberations, concluding a trial that started Monday.</p>
<p>Defence attorney Barry Levine said he would ask U.S. District Judge James Robertson to set aside the verdict and if that failed, an appeal was possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the verdict is wrong. It is not supported by the evidence,&quot; Levine told reporters. &quot;This is not a case the Justice Department would have brought.&quot;</p>
<p>Charges stemmed from an investigation of Espy headed by independent counsel Donald Smaltz. Espy resigned in late 1994 amid allegations he improperly accepted gifts from businesses regulated by his department. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;This verdict demonstrates that the jury was not fooled by the defence's attempts to discredit the nature and substance of the investigators' questions to Mr. Williams,&quot; Smaltz said in a statement.</p>
<p>While prosecutors said Williams deliberately misled investigators from the Agriculture Department and FBI, Levine argued the agents kept imprecise notes of their sessions and had no transcript or verbatim account of what was said.</p>
<p>The maximum penalty faced by Williams was five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His lawyers have said under sentencing guidelines he might serve no more than six months, possibly on probation.</p>
<p>Lead prosecutor Robert Ray said Williams, in two sessions with Agriculture Department and FBI agents, &quot;spoke words and those words were lies.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a case about the failings of investigators, Levine told jurors. &quot;They want to blame him about questions they did not ask ... You can't let that happen.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the agents, Williams said he knew nothing about Espy's attendance as a Tyson Foods guest at a Jan. 16, 1994, pro football game in Dallas and never spoke to Espy's girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, by telephone.</p>
<p>Other witnesses said Williams paid for Dempsey's $1,009 airline ticket to the game and notified Tyson headquarters to expect her. He also relayed to her by fax an application for a $1,200 Tyson Foundation scholarship.</p>
<p>While Ray and an assistant, Barry Coburn, said evidence consistently showed that Williams repeatedly misled investigators, Levine said it was impossible to know exactly what Williams was asked and what he said.</p>
<p>Legal experts have said the outcome of the case might be key in the Espy investigation and its credibility.</p>
<p>A Smaltz spokesman said the Espy investigation would not be affected by the verdict on Williams.</p>
