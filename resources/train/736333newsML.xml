<p>A senior member of Italy's biggest trades union confederation said on Thursday that welfare spending needed to be rebalanced, and hoped the government would meet labour groups half way on some proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a rebalancing to be done within Italian social spending because expenditure on pensions keeps growing while spending on health, assistance and training is falling,&quot; Guglielmo Epifani, number two at the Cgil trades union confederation, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>The governemnt, which last month launched major negotiations with union leaders and employers' groups to reform the welfare state and in particularly the pensions sector, has said it wants to cut public spending by 15 trillion lire next year.</p>
<p>Epifani said there was a &quot;certain margin of rationalisation&quot; to be made within welfare spending, including &quot;to some extent the pensions sector.&quot;</p>
<p>The welfare reform talks this week began looking at pensions in detail. Union leaders and the hard-left Communist Refoundation party, whose support gives Prime Minister Romano Prodi a parliamentary majority, have been reluctant to countenance pension cuts.</p>
<p>Epifani said there were still big differences between sectors and workers regarding pensions contributions and payments and he wanted to see that harmonised.</p>
<p>&quot;If we aim for a unified level of contributions, maybe we will also manage to boost revenue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he said much depended on the government's attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government meets us half way on some of our proposals...it will be easier to reach a deal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was important to reach agreement by the end of September, when the 1998 budget must be presented to parliament, he added.</p>
<p>The government has pushed through nearly 100 trillion lire of spending cuts since it took office in May 1996 in order to clean up Italy's public finances in time for the planned 1999 launch of Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>Epifani said unions had always accepted the challenge of the joining the euro, which would be a stronger currency than the lire and would benefit workers.</p>
