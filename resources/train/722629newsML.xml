<headline>NYS transportation agency weighs Dec. bond sale.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-11</dateline>

<p>New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority said Friday it might sell from $250 million to $400 million of revenue bonds in December after its new capital plan was approved by Albany.</p>
<p>Stephen Reitano, chief financial officer, said, &quot;We're going to borrow as we need the money.&quot; He explained the new $11.9 billion capital program will let the agency sell about $5 billion of bonds.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're going to do $1 billion a year,&quot; added Reitano, who spoke to Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The precise size of the December offering will depend on the authority's borrowing needs. PaineWebber likely would run the books on the bond sale, and the offering probably would be supported by dedicated taxes collected in the downstate region on various items, like a utility tax.</p>
<p>The Authority's new capital plan, which includes federal and state aid, runs from 1995 to 1999. About $7.3 billion of spending from the start of this year to 1999 was approved for new buses, subway and commuter trains and station renovations, according to published reports.</p>
<p>Reitano added no changes were expected in the Authority's underwriting team. Merrill Lynch will run the books on next week's sale of $300 million of refunding bonds, while Smith Barney was expected to hold the top spot on the syndicate for a September sale of about $350 million of bonds that would be supported by transit fares.</p>
