<p>Former South Australian finance minister Dale Baker had been cleared of criminal wrong-doing over alleged impropriety in a land deal, the State's Attorney General Trevor Griffin said on Friday.</p>
<p>But Baker now faced a government inquiry into allegations that he had a conflict of interest in relation to the deal and conducted private business while on a ministerial visit to Hong Kong, Griffin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Baker, a former Liberal Opposition leader, stood down from the ministry in February following allegations he was involved in a private bid to buy land in the south east of the State in which his department was also interested.</p>
<p>Griffin said he had been advised by the Director of Public Prosecution, Paul Rofe QC, following an inquiry by the anti-corruption branch of the State police, that in his view there was no evidence of criminal behaviour on Baker's part.</p>
<p>The conflict of interest inquiry, to be conducted by Tim Anderson QC, was expected to be completed in a month, he said.</p>
