<p>Ty Detmer, who led the Philadelphia Eagles to the playoffs last season, beat out Rodney Peete and will start at quarterback for the August 31 season opener against the New York Giants, the team announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Detmer, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1990 after a spectacular junior season at Brigham Young University, joined the Eagles as a free agent before the 1996 season. The six-year veteran was drafted in the ninth round (230th overall) by the Green Bay Packers in 1992.</p>
<p>The 6-foot (1.83 metres), 194-pound (88 kg) quarterback set 59 national records while at BYU, including touchdown passes (121), yards (15,031), completions (958) and attempts (1,530).</p>
<p>Detmer assumed the reins for the Eagles in the fifth game of the 1996 campaign after Peete suffered a season-ending knee injury. Detmer led Philadelphia to the playoffs but the Eagles lost to the San Francisco 49ers 14-0 in the wild card round. He was 14-of-21 for 148 yards and two interceptions in the defeat.</p>
<p>Detmer finished the season completing 238 of his 401 pass attempts, good for 2,911 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also had 13 interceptions and a quarterback rating of 80.8, which placed him fourth in the NFC.</p>
<p>Peete, who signed a one-year contract with the Eagles in the off-season, opened last season as a starter and completed 59.7 percent of his passes for 992 yards with three touchdowns and five interceptions in the first five games before going down with a torn patella tendon in his right knee.</p>
<p>Peete is 12-5 in 17 career starts for the Eagles and led them to a playoff victory following the 1995 campaign. An eight-year veteran, Peete spent his first six years with the Detroit Lions before playing the 1994 season with the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
