<p>A partially bond-financed retail mall in downtown Indianapolis celebrates its one-year anniversary Sunday and indications are that the project has been a success.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel very good and the mall is doing what it's suppose to do,&quot; said Jim Snyder, special council to Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith.</p>
<p>What the Circle Centre mall has done, according to Snyder, is help attract other development to the city's downtown. So far, the list includes a number of hotels, restaurants and a recently announced new office building, he said.</p>
<p>Indianapolis Local Public Improvement Bond Bank sold tax increment financing bonds, secured by the city's moral obligation pledge, in 1988 to help build the mall. However, numerous delays, including a sluggish retail climate, a property tax dispute within the TIF district, and the mall developer's problem obtaining his share of the financing, pushed back the original 1991 opening to 1995.</p>
<p>In 1992, even though the mall was still just a bunch of holes in the ground, the bond bank refinanced $290 million of bonds.</p>
<p>Snyder, who is also executive director of the bond bank, said that revenues from property taxes within the 150-square block TIF district in downtown Indianapolis backing the bonds, are running $1 million to $1.5 million a year over estimates.</p>
<p>Richard Raphael, executive managing director at Fitch Investors Service, said he was glad to see the mall project worked out well.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very central to the city's (downtown) development efforts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fitch rates the TIF bonds AA. Analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., which rates the debt A-plus, were not available to comment.</p>
<p>The 800,000-square-foot mall is 97 percent leased and has annualized sales of $400 per square foot, according to a news release from the mall.</p>
