<p>An experimental Consumer Price Index released Thursday showed that the lowest inflation rate in a generation might have been even lower than the official numbers reported, the Labour Department said Thursday.</p>
<p>Using a different approach to analysing the vast data that the department uses to measure consumer inflation, the report showed the experimental consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.9 percent last year rather than the 3.3 percent reported officially.</p>
<p>The experimental CPI, which will be tracked on a month-to-month basis for the rest of this year, was given high marks by Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, appointed by Congress to investigate the bias in the CPI.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to the BLS (Bureau of Labour Statistics) moving with all deliberate speed -- emphasising both deliberate and speed -- to implementing the geometric mean in the official CPI, as opposed to just an experimental index,&quot; he said. The geometric mean is a mathematical formula.</p>
<p>But the report also came under fire from some economists, who feared it would lure Washington policy-makers into a false sense of security at a time when inflation might be lurking just off stage.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is strong, unemployment is falling and inflation may be accelerating, but all this might be obscured by this kind of report, experimental or not,&quot; said David Jones of the brokerage Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. &quot;It's a matter of timing.&quot;</p>
<p>The report generally confirmed the department's belief that switching to a system using the geometric mean as opposed to the straight arithmetic approach would show a reduction in the CPI of one-quarter of 1 percent per year.</p>
<p>Officials said the system helps adjust for the so-called substitution factor in which consumers, faced with a price jump for one item, will seek to substitute it with something less expensive.</p>
<p>But it does so on a rather narrow basis, officials told a briefing for reporters, accounting, for instance, for a switch from romaine to iceberg lettuce rather than on a change from beef to less expensive chicken.</p>
<p>Comparing the new, experimental index with a similar -- but not identical to the official CPI -- proxy index, the department found that inflation rose 16.2 percent for the experimental rate and 18.6 percent for the proxy rate between December 1990 and February 1997.</p>
<p>While the changes are small, they carry a heavy political element because the CPI is used to set increases in benefits that millions of older citizens get through Social Security to make up for inflation.</p>
<p>The closely watched index is also used to calculate tax brackets and personal exemptions for income tax and is widely used in commercial and union contracts.</p>
<p>Moreover, budget savings from a more accurate cost-of-living measure could be enormous as Congress and the Clinton administration try to end the budget deficit by 2002.</p>
<p>Economists believe, however, that government technicians can only go so far in correcting for the upward bias in the CPI that Boskin, in his report to Congress, said amounted to 1.1 percentage points.</p>
<p>In the end, it will probably require an independent commission to establish the bias and adjust the index accordingly, although so far neither Congress or the administration has showed much inclination to form such a body, analysts said.</p>
<p>Any change in the official CPI as a result of the experimental effort will probably not be included until January 1999.</p>
<p>The Labour Department will issue the official CPI for March on Tuesday and the experimental report April 22. Both rose 0.3 percent in February.</p>
