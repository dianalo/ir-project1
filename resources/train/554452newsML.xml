<p>An Israeli commander in Lebanon says his country's leading guerrilla enemy there is finding it hard to enlist recruits in the face of the Jewish state's military operations.</p>
<p>Brigadier-General Eli Amitay told Israel's Air Force Journal there were also signs that fighters were defecting from the group, the Shi'ite Moslem &quot;Party of God&quot; known as Hizbollah.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last three months the air force has managed to tilt the balance in the fighting against Hizbollah,&quot; Amitay said in the interview made available on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Operations in which warplanes, helicopter gunships and assault helicopters took part caused the Hizbollah organisation to shrink,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the general's assessment, northern Israeli residents said Hizbollah attacks had not seemed to have diminished in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Israeli security officials had been saying that Iran was still actively arming the organisation with shipments of missiles and automatic weapons.</p>
<p>But Amitay said: &quot;Today people are more afraid of joining Hizbollah, and members of the organisation itself are more fearful to act.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to the fact that Hizbollah finds it hard to find new people to join its ranks, there are signs of a phenomenon of defections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli troops, backed by South Lebanon Army militiamen, police a 15 km (nine mile) wide security zone in south Lebanon with the aim of preventing attacks on Israel's northern border.</p>
<p>Hizbollah guerrillas frequently attack them.</p>
<p>Amitay also said that some months ago a cave was found with 17 shoulder-held rocket launchers for use against planes and helicopters.</p>
