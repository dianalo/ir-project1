<p>Spiegel Inc., parent of retailer Eddie Bauer and the troubled Spiegel catalogue, said Friday that Chief Executive John Shea will retire nine months earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Shea, who will retire July 3, had previously planned to leave the company on his 60th birthday next March, it said.</p>
<p>But he decided to leave now because the expansion of Eddie Bauer has been successful and a reorganization of its flagship Spiegel catalogue already was under way, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack made a personal decision to retire,&quot; said Spiegel spokeswoman Debbie Koopman.</p>
<p>Still the depature was sudden, Wall Street analysts said. While the company recorded a loss in the first quarter, few analysts expected it to return to profitability this year. In addition, the company recently unveiled an overhaul of the Spiegel division that was expected to help results.</p>
<p>Shea could not be reached for elaboration. Spiegel has not launched a search for a replacement. Instead, its board named three executives to an office of the president.</p>
<p>Harold Dahlstrand, a board member and senior vice president of human resources, will serve as chairman of the office of president, it said. Michael Moran, general counsel, and James Sievers, chief financial officer, were named to serve alongside Dahlstrand.</p>
<p>Shea's depature comes after a series of changes aimed at fixing its depressed Spiegel catalogue division, where weak results added to a 5 percent drop in the company's total sales in the first quarter. Spiegel has not reported an annual profit since 1994.</p>
<p>Some analysts said Shea's leaving was linked to the restructuring unveiled last week of Spiegel in which the division was carved into three main catalogues targeting the upscale, moderately priced and low-end markets.</p>
<p>The heads of the three catalogues, along with a fourth executive who will oversee an &quot;outlet&quot; catalogue, will report to John Irvin, president of the Spiegel catalogue division.</p>
<p>By leaving the company, Shea removed a layer of management and gave those executives more room to run the businesses themselves, said analyst Dean Ramos of Dain Bosworth Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing is not coincidental with the restructuring of the Spiegel catalogue,&quot; he said. If Shea remained, &quot;the tendency would be to revert back to the old management reporting system.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, Spiegel lost $13.4 million, or 12 cents a share. In the first quarter alone, the company's losses more than doubled to $31 million, or 28 cents a share.</p>
<p>One of Spiegel catalogu's biggest missteps of late was targeting an upscale market, a change its meat-and-potatoes customer resented, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They came out with some catalogues that we thought, quite frankly, were mistakes,&quot; said Maxwell Sroge, a catalogue industry consultant.</p>
<p>Spiegel does not break out results of its divisions. But Alexander Paris, president of Barrington Research Assoc., said Eddie Bauer, which represents 55 percent of sales, is profitable, and Spiegel, which adds 35 percent to revenue, is not profitable.</p>
<p>Spiegel was founded in 1865 by the Spiegel family and was sold in 1982 to the German catalogue giant Otto Versand GmbH &amp; Co. Since then, the majority of Spiegel shares have passed to Spiegel Holdings Inc., which is controlled by the Otto family, including Michael Otto, Spiegel's chairman.</p>
<p>Spiegel's stock was unchanged at $6.625 on Nasdaq.</p>
