<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer's fierce opposition to Bonn's attempts to revalue the central bank's reserves shows that he left political ties to Chancellor Helmut Kohl behind a long time ago.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer and Kohl have been long-time friends, with the relationship culminating in Kohl asking Teitmeyer to join the Bundesbank board as Helmut Schlesinger's deputy in 1991. He became president in 1993.</p>
<p>But his rejection on Wednesday of Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plan to revalue the bank's gold and foreign exchange reserves underscored a single-minded crusade for an independent European central bank and strong future common currency.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues broadsided the Kohl government, regardless of what the unprecedented public fight between the two sides could do to Kohl's political future -- or Tietmeyer's own position.</p>
<p>Market talk on Wednesday suggested Tietmeyer, who will turn 66 in August, might quit over the row with Waigel, with whom he has had a long but not overly friendly relationship. The Bundesbank quickly denied the rumours.</p>
<p>But some in the German media think there may be some truth in suggestions that Tietmeyer may give up the fight.</p>
<p>A commentator on German public television station ARD on Wednesday said: &quot;Today, Tietmeyer denied he was going to quit.&quot; He then paused for effect to add, &quot;Today.&quot;</p>
<p>Waigel's move is aimed at helping Bonn plug its public debt to reach entry criteria for the single European currency laid out in the Maastricht Treaty that must be met in 1997.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer, while agreeing gold reserves must be revalued, interpreted Waigel's timing of the plan as an attack on the independence of the Bundesbank.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer has been a guiding force in preparing the European Union, as well as his own doubtful countrymen, for the launch of the new currency.</p>
<p>That, says Tietmeyer, can be best done by interpreting strictly the Maastricht criteria even if Bonn fails to do so.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer has lobbied hard for the new Frankfurt-based European Central Bank to be modelled on the Bundesbank and for it to adopt many of the same policies.</p>
<p>He expects the first European bank president to also press the need for tough anti-inflationary policies, chide member governments to rein in spending and guard the new euro as he did the mark, a symbol of post-war Germany's rebirth.</p>
<p>Despite speculation to the contrary, Bundesbank observers see no sign of Tietmeyer giving up on his missionary zeal for a strong and stable euro, which would be based on a strict interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty's membership criteria.</p>
<p>Instead, they see Tietmeyer standing firm in his position, one that has quickly won him the battle for public opinion as initial press comments on Thursday ran heavily against Bonn's &quot;creative attempts&quot; to whip Germany's finances into shape.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is poised to end his career as the last president of the Bundesbank as it is now known.</p>
<p>An unwritten rule at the German central bank says he must step down when he turns 68, enough time to see him through the end of the Bundesbank's policy-making powers in late 1998.</p>
