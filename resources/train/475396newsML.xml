<p>A 13-year-old Chicago boy who was the victim of an apparent racially motivated beating was moved to a rehabilitation hospital after he regained consciousness Friday, a hospital spokesman said.</p>
<p>Lenard Clark sustained severe head injuries after he was knocked off his bicycle and beaten March 21, allegedly by three white teens who later bragged they were keeping blacks out of their South Side neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The teens, two high school students at De La Salle Institute aged 17 and 18 and a recent graduate aged 19, were charged with attempted murder and committing hate crimes. They remained free on bond.</p>
<p>Clark awoke from a week-long coma Friday and was showing signs of improved motor ability, John Reyes, media coordinator at Cook County Hospital, said. He was moved to the pediatric ward of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.</p>
<p>Lisa Thornton, Clark's doctor at the rehabilitation centre, told a news conference Clark was doing well and responding to his mother's voice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a third day of peace marches and protests were planned for Saturday in Bridgeport, the neighbourhood on the south side of Chicago where Clark was beaten. Community and city leaders were expected to attend.</p>
<p>Eddie Read, president of Chicago Black United Community that sponsored the marches, told a news conference that about 150 people delivered invitations Friday to city officials, police and representatives of the De La Salle Institute asking them to attend a community hearing on racism April 19.</p>
