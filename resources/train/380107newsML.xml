<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metal futures ended mixed on Friday, with palladium sharply lower on profit taking amid expectations that Japan-Russia platinum group metal supply talks may soon resume, traders said.</p>
<p>Palladium futures ranged from six yen to 19 yen per gram lower, with benchmark December ending down 18 at 547 yen.</p>
<p>Gold futures were mostly lower, except for April which was up two yen. Benchmark December was down two at 1,361 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Views are emerging in the market that the upside in palladium will be limited due to expectations that the Japan-Russia talks will resume soon,&quot; one senior dealer said.  </p>
<p>A Russian trade official in Tokyo said on Friday that he expected Japan-Russia talks on 1997 platinum group metal supplies would be held sometime in March.</p>
<p>Traders said that palladium futures dipped early and then extended those losses on trade house selling.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $341.70/342.20 per ounce at 0746 GMT, against $340.75/341.25 at New York&quot;s Thursday close.</p>
<p>Spot gold was firmer during Asian hours, led by buying from overseas investors, but resistance was seen at $344.00.</p>
<p>In the gold futures market, individual investors were seen buying early in the day and taking profits later, traders said.  </p>
<p>Most silver futures ended sharply higher, buoyed by strong bullion prices, while platinum futures received a boost from active short covering, traders said.</p>
<p>Most-active December silver futures rose the daily limit of 7.0 yen to 207.2 yen per 10 grams.</p>
<p>Benchmark December platinum futures rose 10 yen to 1,442 yen per gram. &quot;Platinum&quot;s rise was led by silver&quot;s strength and recent gains in palladium. Upside potential could be limited as the platinum market lacks any fresh factors,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>In spot platinum, overseas selling was met by Japanese buying, he said.  --Tokyo Commodity Desk +81-3-3432-7431</p>
