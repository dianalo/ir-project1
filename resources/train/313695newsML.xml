<p>Hundreds of Indonesian villagers living near Mount Merapi in Central Java have been told to be ready to evacuate after the volcano started spewing burning ash and hot lava this week, a vulcanology official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Merapi continues to spew hot lava and ash today. Villagers living near Merapi have been asked to be ready for evacuation any time,&quot; the official at the vulcanology office in Yogyakarta told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The 2,911-metre (9,548 ft) Merapi erupted without warning in November 1994, killing 60 people and displacing more than 2,000 from its fertile slopes, 400 km (250 miles) east of Jakarta.</p>
<p>The official said so far nobody had been evacuated, adding the vulcanology office had also recorded several tremors from Merapi.</p>
<p>&quot;No residents have been evacuated, but we are ready to issue warning any time for the evacuation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Post newspaper reported on Thursday residents of Turgo and Tritis villages, which were badly affected by the 1994 eruption, had been asked to stay in a nearby school.</p>
<p>It is a common practice during times of high volcanic activity for people from the most vulnerable villages to sleep in designated evacuation centres at night to ensure they could be moved quickly in case of an eruption.</p>
<p>Merapi, Indonesia's most active volcano, recorded its most destructive eruption this century in 1930, when 1,300 people were killed.</p>
