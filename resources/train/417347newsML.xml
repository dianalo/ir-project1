<headline>Czech PX50 falls sharply led by high caps.</headline>

<p>Heavy losses among Czech major issues pushed the PX50 index below 600 on Tuesday with dealers blaming the decline on worse than expected company results.</p>
<p>The PX50 fell 8.1 points, 1.34 percent, to 598.5 while the RPIX lost 21.9 points, 1.71 percent, to 1,261.3.</p>
<p>The major issue decliners were led by Komercni Banka which fell 90 crowns, 3.3 percent, to 2,635. Power utility CEZ dropped 30 crowns, 2.5 percent, to 1,148 and SPT Telecom lost 40 crowns, one percent, to 3,800.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the results being reported by companies they are not that good,&quot; said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, CEZ released its 1996 preliminary results through the Prague Stock Exchange which expanded upon, and made more precise, estimates offered by the company the day before.</p>
<p>CEZ's net profit results were almost unchanged at 8.1 billion crowns while gross profits fell to 13.4 billion crowns from 14.8 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Komercni Banka released its 1996 results on Friday. Profits were slightly up but analysts said the figures were not as good as they had hoped for. SPT Telecom still has not published its financial results for 1996.</p>
