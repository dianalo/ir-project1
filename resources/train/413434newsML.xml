<p>Australian independent Senator Mal Colston said on Monday that all upper house members of parliament should have their travel allowances checked.</p>
<p>Colston, a key Senate independent, has been accused of fraud, which he denies. If charged and convicted, he would be forced to leave parliament.</p>
<p>Colston said in a statement he would talk with Senate officials later on Monday about new allegations of travel allowance abuse raised in weekend media reports.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, as my travel allowance claims have received daily scrutiny, I believe the same should apply for every other member of the Senate,&quot; Colston said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, this afternoon, I will give notice of motion that all travel allowance documents of all senators be tabled in the Senate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Colston, who defected from the Labor Party in August, is being examined by the Australian Federal Police over allegations he misused parliamentary allowances, gave government-paid jobs in his office to relatives who did not work and misused government car entitlements.</p>
<p>Colston is one of the two independents in the Senate who have routinely supplied the two votes that the Liberal-National government needs to pass contentious legislation.</p>
<p>Despite a massive majority in the lower house, the government is in a minority in the Senate, which has the power to block laws.</p>
