<p>Gold OTC option volatilities have starting picking up from all-time lows as underlying prices tumble into new, lower territory, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;They've firmed up and it's because we're testing one extreme of the range at the moment -- the downside,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Gold at-the-money one-month volatilities were bid at 5.5 percent, up from recent lows of four percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>Other nearby dates were about a percentage point higher than a month ago, with three-month volatilities bid at 5.75.</p>
<p>&quot;On a daily basis we're seeing good buying of gold puts, which are actually priced higher than calls. We haven't seen that for a long time,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>He noted heavy interest at $375 in recent days as the underlying price plummeted to fresh 20-month lows. Previously one-month volatilities had been at historic lows while bullion moved in a narrow range.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at the lowest since March 3, 1995 in the morning at $375.10 an ounce, down from Friday afternoon's fixing of $377.00 an ounce.</p>
<p>Nearby dates were attracting the most attention, dealers said. Longer-term dates were up only about half a percentage point, with six-month volatility bid at around 6.25 and one-year dates about 6.75.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still cheap to buy long term insurance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The effect of this week's options expiry was difficult to predict with the underlying price still sinking to fresh lows after a big sell-off last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to know what to make of it because we're in new territory. There was a lot of exposure from $378 to $380 previously but now that we're at $375, we may just stay here,&quot; a dealer said. Volumes have also picked up since gold started losing ground, although not excessively, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not an awful lot going on, but it's better than it has been for about two months. I'd call it medium quantities,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Another noted that interest remained mostly in the inter-bank sector, with customer interest only slightly stronger than last month.</p>
