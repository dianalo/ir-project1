<p>As the Australian government finalises its timetable for the phase-out of analogue mobile phones, industry players say they are confident the transition to digital technology will be smooth.</p>
<p>The analogue network is scheduled to shut on January 1, 2000. However, there has been speculation the government will extend the deadline for some rural areas which may still be without digital coverage.</p>
<p>The government is reviewing a report from the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA), which consulted groups such as the National Farmers' Federation and telecoms carriers Optus Communications Pty Ltd and state-owned Telstra Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;SMA has actually put together how we should handle the phase-out -- it's just a matter of fine tuning it,&quot; a spokesman for Communications Minister Richard Alston told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still a couple of weeks away from making an announcement.&quot;</p>
<p>But Optus Communications and Telstra said they believed all areas currently covered by analogue would have access to a digital service by the deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;What Optus believes is that there'll be no need to extend the deadline because we believe that all the areas currently covered by analogue will be covered by digital by the year 2000,&quot; Optus spokeswoman Kate Van den Broek said in an interview.</p>
<p>Optus' digital network covered more than 86 percent of the population, Van den Broek said. Telstra said its digital network covered 90 percent. This compared with analogue's population reach of 91 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Even today, if the analogue network for some reason fell over or died, we estimate that there are only 10,000 people in Australia who would be left without a mobile phone,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;When you look at the fact that there's now four million mobile phones in Australia, 10,000 people is a very, very small percentage of the mobile phone-owning population.&quot;</p>
<p>The analogue closure is part of Canberra's deregulation of the telecommunications industry from July next year, which will allow open competition in all sectors.</p>
<p>Currently, rival carriers Optus and Vodaphone Group on-sell the Telstra owned and operated analogue network, paying Telstra an inter-connect fee. They say this erodes their competitiveness.</p>
<p>Van den Broek said Optus' greatest concern regarding the phase-out was the need for an &quot;orderly transition&quot; from analogue to digital without a mad scramble at the end.</p>
<p>&quot;We're concerned that people need to start changing lanes now to avoid congestion in December 1999,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>However, she said figures in June this year showed only one in 10 new customers join the analogue network, compared with two out of three customers choosing analogue in June last year.</p>
<p>&quot;People just aren't buying analogue phones any more,&quot; she said. &quot;We're certainly not seeing a huge volume of sales.&quot;</p>
<p>Optus has 800,000 analogue customers or one-third of the market, while Telstra has around 1.8 million customers.</p>
<p>In the digital market, Telstra has about 500,000 customers, while Optus has more than 450,000.</p>
