<title>UK: UK gilts close easier on softer Treasuries.</title>
<headline>UK gilts close easier on softer Treasuries.</headline>
<text>
<p>1620 GMT - UK gilt futures closed easier, undermined by the softer tone internationally despite a supportive BRC retail sales survey. Traded volume in the June contract was a modest 52,389 contracts. Feb manufacturing output data due Wednesday.</p>
<p>* June gilt contract ended 3/32 easier at 111-25/32  </p>
<p>Rayner said the BRC survey had been positive on prices as well as volumes, showing that part of the drop in February sales was due to lower prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a positive story from that, but overall the market is not looking comfortable because of the U.S.,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. market really is beginning to worry now. In our view it is starting to look decidedly likely that Mr Greenspan is going to make a move.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation is mounting that the Fed chairman may be inching towards the first U.S. interest rate in two years as the labour market tightens.  </p>
<p>The next domestic focus for gilts will be January industrial production data on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Manufacturing output is expected to have risen by 0.3 percent in the month, slightly higher than December's 0.2 percent, giving a year-on-year rate of 1.5 percent after December's 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>Overall industrial production growth is expected to have eased to 0.2 percent from December's 0.6 percent, but the year-on-year rate should pick up to 2.7 percent from 1.9 percent.  </p>
<p>The Treasury will publish its debt management report, including the 1997/98 funding remit, at 1530 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts expect no major changes in the existing mix of conventional and index-linked gilts or in maturity ranges.</p>
<p>June short sterling was two basis points higher at 93.62, implying official interest rates of around 6.4 percent at the end of the second quarter compared with the present 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>The gilt-Bund spread at 10 years was 173 basis points compared with Monday's 171.</p>
