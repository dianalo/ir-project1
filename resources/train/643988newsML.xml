<p>The U.S. unemployment rate fell in May to its lowest level in more than 23 years, but jobs growth slowed sharply, the government said on Friday in a report that painted a mixed picture of the labour market.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said the unemployment rate edged down to 4.8 percent in May -- its lowest level since October 1973 -- from 4.9 percent in April. But payrolls rose by just 138,000 last month after increasing by a whopping 323,000 in April.</p>
<p>The department had originally reported that payrolls grew by 142,000 in April. The steep upward revision reflects new seasonal adjustment factors and other changes meant to more accurately measure the state of the jobs market.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast an unemployment rate of 5.0 percent and the creation of 219,000 non-farm jobs in May.</p>
<p>The unemployment report is the government's first reading of the economy' temperature each month and thus is closely scrutinised on Wall Street and in Washington.</p>
<p>The figures -- especially for jobs growth -- can be volatile from month to month. But the data so far this year portray a labour market that is very tight, with payroll growth averaging 229,000 per month.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve policy-makers are worried that the tight jobs market will encourage workers to demand big pay hikes, eventually stoking up inflation.</p>
<p>In an effort to prevent that from happening, the central bank raised interest rates in March for the first time in over two years. But it held off from raising them further last momth, in hopes that the economy would slow and pressure on the jobs market would ease. The central bank next meets to ponder interest rate strategy on July 1-2.</p>
<p>Last month's jobs numbers provide the Fed with reasons that support holding rates unchanged or raising them. The sharp slowdown in the growth of payrolls argues for a steady policy. But the further drop in the unemployment rate buttresses those who believe that higher rates are needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The unemployment rate will put the Fed on alert,&quot; said Dan Seto, economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. &quot;As for payrolls, the labour market is tight ... all indications suggest resurgence of growth. We think the Fed will raise rates in July.&quot;</p>
<p>As is usually the case, much of the growth in payrolls last month came in the service sector, including the amusement,  recreation and hotel industries.</p>
<p>Construction employment also bounced back in May, after being depressed in April by unseasonably cool and wet weather. Manufacturing employment was essentially flat, however, held down by a strike in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Perhaps reflecting the overall tightness of the labour market, average earnings rose by four cents an hour last month, to $12.19.</p>
<p>In discussing the figures, Bureau of Labour Statistics Commissioner Katharine Abraham said the unemployment rate in May was a half a percentage point lower than at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said that drop reflects the overall healthy state of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>After growing at a sizzling 5.8 percent pace in the first quarter -- its fastest pace in nine years -- the economy showed signs of slowing modestly in April, but still remains robust, they said.</p>
