<p>Thai stocks ended 1.02 percent lower in thin trade on Monday after investors took profits and foreign interest remained slack due to a holiday in Hong Kong, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index ended 11.29 points lower at 1,095.44 on 1.9 billion baht trade. Decliners trounced gainers 232 to 80 while 93 issues unchanged. The SET-50 index was 1.00 point lower to 83.66.</p>
<p>&quot;The market lacked positive news while investors continued worrying about local economic and political problems,&quot; said Virat Tippanontakul of First Asia Securities.  </p>
<p>Brokers said declines on Wall Street on Friday and other markets in the region on Monday also discouraged investors from entering the market.</p>
<p>Virat said investors were worried about the Thai economy and the coalition government's stability.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have submitted a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa and the debate will be held in the parliament next month.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were reluctant to invest as they awaited key economic data to be released by the central bank on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Investors sold key stocks in bank, energy and finance counters on Monday.</p>
<p>National Fertilizer, debuting in the chemicals and plastics sector, topped the active list and ended down 6.10 baht from its initial public offering price of 16. Finance One fell three to 108 while Krung Thai Bank slipped four to 107 and Electricity Generating declined one to 75.</p>
<p>Near term support is seen by some brokers at 1,090 points while resistance is pegged at 1,115.</p>
