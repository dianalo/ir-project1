<p>Persistent weakness in the dollar lifted implied volatilities on shorter-dated dollar/yen options at midday in U.S. trading, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar broke important support at 118 yen late in the European day, dragged down in part by weakness in mark/yen, which hit its lowest level in almost a year.</p>
<p>U.S. traders said yen calls were attracting a strong bid, resulting in hefty premiums on shorter dates out through two months.  </p>
<p>&quot;As we broke through 118 we just lost all the offers. Everyone is very jittery. No one really knows where the support levels are,&quot; said an options broker in New York.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was fearful of another swift drop in dollar/yen following the sharp selloff seen Friday and Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It could move very quickly, and that's what everyone is very concerned with,&quot; said the New York broker.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen volatility firmed to 10.5/10.9 percent from 9.7/9.9 percent Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Interest in longer-dated options was comparatively light, traders said. One-year dollar/yen volatility was up 0.2 point at 9.5/9.7 percent.</p>
<p>Mark/yen volatility was quoted at 9.1/9.4 percent, down from 9.7/10.1 percent Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dollar weakness also was attributed to surprisingly weak U.S. inflation data released earlier in the day that cast fresh doubt on chances for another 25-basis-point hike in the federal funds rate when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week, analysts said.  </p>
<p>The U.S. producer price index fell 0.6 percent in April, with the core index minus food and energy down 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>However, some analysts downplayed the data's importance in light of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent comments that demand factors rather than inflation were of more immediate concern.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark volatilities were slightly lower after Bundesbank officials this morning expressed satisfaction with current exchange rates.  </p>
<p>Spot has edged lower throughout the session and was recently bid at 1.6974 marks, with some analysts looking for a test of 1.6850 near term.</p>
<p>One-month implied volatility for dollar/mark was 8.6/9.0 percent, down about 0.2 point on the day.</p>
