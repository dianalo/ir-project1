<p>Hardline measures to reduce unemployment proposed on Friday by two economic policy heavyweights immediately drew sharp fire from politicians of Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's Social Democratic Party (SDP).</p>
<p>Bank of Finland governor Sirkka Hamalainen and Martti Hetemaki, head of the finance ministry's economics department, called for more incentives to work, less social security and lower taxes to reduce persistently high unemployment.</p>
<p>But SDP politicians retorted that such measures were out of line with the SDP-led government's programme and promises.</p>
<p>Ilkka Joenpalo, SDP MP and chairman of the council of a union for technical employees said implementation of measures like those proposed by Hamalainen and Hetemaki would lead to &quot;a really brutal soup kitchen society, where all social dimensions are completely forgotten.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The support expressed publicly by the head of the finance ministry's economics department ... is a harsh blow against the Lipponen rainbow government's programme,&quot; Joenpalo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hetemaki said earnings-related jobless benefits should be scrapped if one really wanted to reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>Instead of paying unemployment benefits, the state should offer tax relief to low-wage earners and bigger wage differences should also be allowed, he said in a newspaper interview.</p>
<p>In a statement with the 1996 accounts of the central bank, governor Sirkka Hamalainen echoed Hetemaki's thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to accelerate the decline in the unemployment rate, the tax wedge should be narrowed further and the social security and tax system should be made more work-friendly,&quot; she said, but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Last year, unemployment eased slightly, but &quot;continued to pose a serious problem,&quot; Hamalainen said, adding the decline in unemployment was likely to continue, &quot;but again at a very sluggish pace.&quot;</p>
<p>Pertti Paasio, newly elected member of the European Parliament and a former SDP parliamentary group and party chairman, said it was &quot;irresponsible&quot; of high-ranking officials to propose measures so clearly opposed to the government programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Niinisto's should state his view on this,&quot; Paasio said, referring to Hetemaki's boss, Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto.</p>
<p>&quot;If that is the finance minister's view, it must become a government issue for SDP,&quot; Paasio told Reuters. In Finnish politics, a government issue is something onto which a party will stake its participation in the cabinet.</p>
<p>Niinisto is chairman of the Conservative Party, the second biggest after SDP in the five-party coalition which took office in April 1995.</p>
<p>The left-right-green government set as its foremost goal to halve unemployment to 8-9 percent by the end of its term in 1999.</p>
<p>Hetemaki said the current soft approach to reducing unemployment -- increased training and job-sharing -- would not suffice. &quot;If the aim is to halve unemployment the measures must be appropriate relative to the goal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Joenpalo reminded Hetamaki that under an earlier agreement with trade unions, the government had committed itself to maintain the current level and duration of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>And Paasio said the steps taken so far had been successful in the sense that many were now unemployed for shorter periods than before.</p>
<p>&quot;The length of unemployment is more important than the number of unemployed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The legitimacy of the European Union depended on what could be done about the unemployment plaguing most countries in Europe, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Budget deficits are a common problem, public debts are a common problem which others are allowed to interfere with in the framework of EMU, so why is unemployment a matter which nobody can interfere with,&quot; Paasio said.</p>
<p>The mean forecast by four economists for Finland's November unemployment rate is 18.2 percent, up from 17.4 percent in October.</p>
