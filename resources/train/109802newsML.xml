<title>SWITZERLAND: New ABB ceo to continue strategy.</title>
<headline>New ABB ceo to continue strategy.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Goran Lindahl, designated president and chief executive officer of ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, said he would continue ABB's overall strategy, but increase the speed with which it penetrates emerging markets.</p>
<p>Percy Barnevik, current chief executive, also told a news conference that he would be prepared to remain as chairman of ABB for &quot;quite a while&quot;.  </p>
<p>Earlier today, ABB announced that Lindahl would become president and chief executive from January 1, 1997 while Barnevik would remain chairman.</p>
<p>In February ABB announced that Barnevik would take over the functions as both chief executive and chairman as part of a change in the structure of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Barnevik said at that time that the combination of the role of chairman and chief executive was only temporary.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe one should not combine supervision and the executive in the same person because then you supervise yourself,&quot; a good humoured Barnevik told a news conference.</p>
<p>Barnevik said he wished to focus his energies on many of the external tasks he has been taking on as well as improving the relations with customers.</p>
<p>Barnevik, for example, is a member of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's advisory board and he chairs the European Union's competitiveness group. Barnevik said the change meant he would be leaving the day to day operations of ABB, but he stressed that ABB was already a quite a de-centralised company and he had not been looking over the shoulders of his managers.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the guy where the ball stops today and I am leaving the job and he (Lindahl) takes it over,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lindahl said his future challenges would be to keep up what Barnevik had been doing in the last nine years, but increase the speed with which ABB had been penetrating emerging markets.</p>
<p>As an example, Lindahl said ABB's annual turnover in Latin America could be increased to between $3.0 and 3.5 billion over the next four to five years from $1.8 billion currently. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340</p>
