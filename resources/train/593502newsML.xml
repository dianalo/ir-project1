<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has urged King Hussein of Jordan to join in concerted efforts to halt an Israeli settlement drive in Palestinian territories, a senior Palestinian official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the message was conveyed in a letter he handed to Prime Minister Abdul-Salam al-Majali from Arafat for King Hussein on the latest developments in the peace process after a mission to the region by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross.</p>
<p>&quot;The letter called for Arab and international coordination to stop Israel's settlement policy and the need to work together to put an end to Israel's practices before it's too late,&quot; Erekat told Reuters after talks in Amman.</p>
<p>Erekat also handed Majali a file of all Israeli settlement activities since January this year.</p>
<p>Majali was quoted by the state news agency Petra as saying Jordan reiterated to Erekat his country's &quot;firm support&quot; to the Palestinians in their right to national self-determination.</p>
<p>Israel and the Palestinians are refusing to budge from positions which froze on March 18 when Israel broke ground on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Palestinians demand Israel halt all settlement activity, which they see as an attempt to pre-empt final peace talks, as a condition to resuming negotiations.</p>
