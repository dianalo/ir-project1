<p>Japanese video-game giant Sega Enterprises Ltd and toy-maker Bandai Co. Ltd, said Thursday they would merge in October, creating what they called &quot;a formidable force&quot; in the media entertainment business.</p>
<p>Rival Sony Corp. expressed surprise and behemoth Nintendo Co. Ltd shrugged off the move with a &quot;no worries&quot; comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the merger of Sega, maker of the Sega Saturn 32-bit video-game player, and Bandai, known for its Dragon Ball, Power Ranger and Sailor Moon character toys, posed little threat to Sony's growing grip on the game player market.</p>
<p>But the corporate marriage could give Sega-Bandai, as the new firm will be known, a head start in the race to profit by linking televisions, video games and the Internet, some analysts said.</p>
<p>Sega and Bandai said the merged firm would benefit from Sega's video game, virtual reality and computer graphics technologies and from Bandai's know-how in charactor toys, images and music.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to become a global, comprehensive, new entertainment company and expand further internationally,&quot; Sega President Hayao Nakayama said in announcing the merger, noting the new firm would have annual sales of 600 billion yen ($5.04 billion).</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Bandai shareholders will receive 0.76 Sega share for each share of Bandai they hold, representing a modest 8 percent premium over the market value.</p>
<p>That small reward is due in part to a sharp rise in Bandai shares and a moderate fall in Sega's stock before the deal was announced. Based on the prices the day before, the deal would have offered Bandai shareholders a 20 percent premium.</p>
<p>Sega has been suffering from competition with Sony's popular 32-bit PlayStation as well as the 64-bit Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>&quot;This merger probably expresses the feeling of crisis at Sony's growing video-game market dominance,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts say Sony's PlayStation has been pulling ahead by winning over some key software houses.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the (new) firm can beat Sony's PlayStation in any way,&quot; said Yasuo Imanaka, an analyst at Okasan Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>Last December, Sega -- plagued by excess inventory of 16-bit games and by losses at its U.S. unit -- slashed its forecast for group net profits in the year to March 1997 almost in half, to 5.3 billion yen ($44.5 million).</p>
<p>Bandai also has its own troubles.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the toymaker forecast a net loss of 9 billion yen ($75.6 million) instead of the 10.50 billion yen ($88.2 million) profit seen earlier.</p>
<p>In November, Bandai admitted misreading market trends by sticking to expensive character toys while the popularity of less costly items like 500-yen ($4) mini-cars soared.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to see a merit in the merger,&quot; said Imanaka said. &quot;Both companies have problems in similar fields.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, the future might hold more promise.</p>
<p>Struggling Apple Computer Inc. is betting that a &quot;Pippin&quot; Internet appliance launched with Bandai will spell success in a &quot;third computing age&quot; of multi-media systems and the Internet. Pippin, a small black box that sits on top of a TV set, is as easy to connect as a video cassette recorder. It uses an unobtrusive keyboard or video game controller for input.</p>
<p>Apple has said it believes Pippin, at a suggested retail price of $599, would become the information access method of choice for families who cannot afford or do not want a computer.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger will provide Sega certain competitiveness in next-generation game machines,&quot; said Masahiro Ono, an analyst at Credit Lyonnaise Securities.</p>
