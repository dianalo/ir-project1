<p>Stocks were mixed in heavy trading Friday as earnings wariness made Wall Street cautious and the market struggled to digest more than a dozen initial public offerings.</p>
<p>Just after 1:10 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.25 points at 5,859.60 after earlier dropping nearly 24 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat decliners, 1,148-973 on heavy volume of 250 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like there's a lot of profit-taking in here and backing and filling, which is the type of activity associated with a short-term top. There are mixed opinions about whether the market will go higher or back off,&quot; said Thom Brown, a managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite added 1.34 points to 1,229.32.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500  stocks shed 0.56 of a point to 685.31.</p>
<p>Economic news had little impact, though Thursday's unexpectedly weak August durable goods report continued to weigh on the market, raising worries about corporate earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some concern about the extent of how powerful earnings will be going forward, given the drop in durables,&quot; said Peter Green, a technical analyst at Gruntal. He noted warnings from such high-profile companies as AT&amp;T Corp. and PepsiCo Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that the Fed has indicated there are some signs of an economic slowing is a cause for concern, obviously because of their impact on corporate earnings. There are more earnings concerns creeping into this picture,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>The government reported its final revision to second-quarter gross domestic product, which came in at a 4.7 percent growth rate, a shade lower than the 4.8 percent reading previously reported.</p>
<p>Bonds lent little support. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/32 to yield 6.88 percent, which was unchanged from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Analysts said the spate of initial public offerings that hit the market cut into the enthusiasm for other issues.</p>
<p>Spanish-language TV broadcaster Univision Communications rallied 7-5/8 to 30-5/8 and Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer International rose to 20 from its $19.55 a share offer price.</p>
<p>Cox Radio Inc. surged 3-5/8 to 22-1/8 in its Wall Street debut, Abacus Direct jumped 4 to 18, sunglasses maker Gargoyles Inc. climbed 4-3/4 to 20-3/4 and RockShox, a maker and deisgner of bicycle suspension products, added 1/4 to 15-1/4. Among other IPOs, Orckit Communications soared 4-1/8 to 20-1/8 and temporary employment concern Staffmark was up 1-3/4 to 13-3/4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Green saw near-term weakness for technology stocks, particularly semiconductor issues. He noted the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index, off two to 190, was not able to reach 200 and &quot;is up against a minor wall.&quot;</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange index was off 0.10 at 567.90.</p>
