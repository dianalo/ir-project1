<text>
<p>NWE high sulphur cracked fuel oil was stronger again on Friday and markets were still tight, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges changed hands at $119, $120 and $121 fob ARA but prices eased back a dollar or two by the day's end.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were also firmer, buoyed by continued demand and tightness for Russian and northwestern European barrels.</p>
<p>Dealers assessed the physical market around the level of cif cargo swaps, which were talked around $118/$119 cif NWE.  </p>
<p>Potential demand from traders and end users lurked in the background, and strong U.S. markets make transatlantic business workable, even though not enough product was seen available in the prompt period to move west.</p>
<p>Low sulphur markets were tight too. The only active offer seen was a cargo loading between October 18 and 20.</p>
<p>This was offered at $126 fob ARA, but bids were hard to pin down and the market was calm.</p>
