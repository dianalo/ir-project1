<p>A reputed cocaine king often described as one of the wealthiest and most-sought-after men in Colombia has been arrested in Venezuela, authorities said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said Justo Pastor Perafan, whose personal fortune has been estimated at $12 billion by Semana, Colombia's leading news magazine, was detained late on Thursday in this city just across the border from Colombia.</p>
<p>Perafan, whose extensive business interests extend to Madrid, Rome, Moscow and South Africa, had been sought for more than a year in Colombia, where police posted a $500,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>
<p>Colombian police and security chiefs flew to Venezuela before dawn on Friday to seek his immediate extradition. But Colombian Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia said it was possible Venezuelan authorities may choose to extradite him to the United States instead.</p>
<p>&quot;He has a criminal record in that country too,&quot; Mejia said on Colombian radio, confirming that Perafan was wanted on drug charges in New York.</p>
<p>Perafan's arrest was confirmed by authorities on both sides of the border, including Gen. Gerardo Briceno, a commander of Venezuela's National Guard in San Cristobal.</p>
<p>Police said Perafan, a 51-year-old former army sergeant and head of the Bogota drug cartel, was using false papers in Venezuela that identified him as Rafael Antonio Cruz Roja. He has been accused of shipping more than 4,400 pounds (2,000 kg) of cocaine to Italy and other countries.</p>
<p>The alleged drug baron had ties to Colombian politicians. Defense minister Guillermo Alberto Gonzalez stepped down last month when it was revealed that Perafan had donated $3,000 to his congressional election campaign in 1989.</p>
<p>Semana magazine last year said Perafan's illicit business empire included partial ownership of a mine in South Africa and an oil pipeline in the former Soviet Union. Many of his properties in Colombia, which include a luxury hotel in Tolima province and most of Baru island, a resort near the Caribbean port city of Cartagena, have been confiscated by police.</p>
<p>&quot;Perafan's fortune is one of the biggest there is,&quot; Gen. Luis Enrique Montenegro, Colombia's secret police chief, told Semana. &quot;It could even surpass that of the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers,&quot; he said, referring to the Cali drug cartel bosses.</p>
<p>With the arrest of the Rodriguezes and most other leaders of the Cali drug mob in 1995 and 1996, Perafan was allegedly the top Colombian drug lord still at large. Wanted posters featuring his picture and a $500,000 reward have been flashed nightly on television for most of last year.</p>
