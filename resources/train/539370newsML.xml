<p>Millfeed prices were mostly steady Friday amid featureless activity, millfeed dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has no direction of its own,&quot; a Missouri dealer said. &quot;I have been told that a lot of competing ingredients havebeen dropping in prices like soy hulls, brewers' grains and that kind of stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, flour mills were still not running well. &quot;It is a very thin market,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In Minneapolis, prices were steady, bolstered by tight supplies. &quot;There is not much feed left to trade this week,&quot; a Minneapolis broker said. &quot;Some flour mills are down because of the rain, snow and flood problems in North Dakota and Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Runtimes were also short in the Tennessee area. &quot;The market is slowly drifting downward and the reason is that it has been so slow in coming down is that runtimes have been so poor,&quot; a Chattanooga dealer said.</p>
<p>He noted runtimes have been averaging about five days a week and some mills were down due to fumigation, he said.</p>
