<p>More than 500 companies from Bosnia and abroad will display their products or offer services to restore Bosnia's war-damaged infrastructure during a four-day exhibition opening on Tuesday, organisers said.</p>
<p>The infrastructure rebuilding exhibition in Sarajevo is an attempt to establish business ties between foreign and local companies, the exhibition manager said on Monday.</p>
<p>London-based International Trade and Exhibitions Group (ITE), which is organising the Sarajevo exhibition together with a local sports centre, began inviting foreign companies last year to come to Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have brought them all (foreign companies) here with the intention of encouraging all of those companies to establish trading links with local companies,&quot; exhibition manager and ITE representative Keith Pitman told reporters.</p>
<p>Bosnia's infrastructure was heavily damaged during a 1992-1995 conflict and the international community has committed several billion dollars for its reconstruction since the fighting ended with a peace accord in November 1995.</p>
<p>The exhibition is also seen as an opportunity for foreign companies to explore ways to win reconstruction contracts funded by the international community in Bosnia and for some cautious direct investment, analysts said.</p>
