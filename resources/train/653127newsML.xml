<headline>China says no date on farm import tariff quotas.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1997-06-11</dateline>

<p>China is considering setting limits on imports of some farm products, including soybeans and soybean oil, but a date has yet to be fixed, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Departments concerned are still discussing how to implement the tariff quota system,&quot; an official of the tariff committee of the State Economic and Trade Commission said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to say when it will go into effect,&quot; she said without giving further details.</p>
<p>China said last year that tariff quotas would apply to imports of some farm goods including wheat, corn, rice, soybeans and soybean oil from April 1996, but has delayed the introduction of the system.</p>
<p>The government has published tariff rates linked to the new tariff quotas but has not announced the quota on each item.</p>
<p>Officials have said the move aims to protect local production and bring China closer to international practices.</p>
<p>However, traders and operators of joint ventures say the quota system is restrictive, encourages smuggling and is a disincentive for foreigners to participate in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Traders attending an international conference in Beijing on China's vegetable oils, fats and feed ingredients industries said a quota is usually issued only to large domestic companies, leaving joint ventures out in the cold.</p>
<p>They point to vegetable oil import licences, which are currently issued to just a handful of state-owned importers.</p>
<p>&quot;What they are trying to do is to limit imports to protect the local crushing industry and the local farmers,&quot; said one trader at the conference, organised by Singapore's Centre for Management Technology.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to encourage joint ventures but you have a quota system and you don't give quota to these ventures, how will they survive?&quot; he asked. &quot;They will leave.&quot;</p>
<p>China's vegetable oil refining industry currently faced overcapacity, another trader said, &quot;but quotas are restricting people from coming in freely to buy&quot;.</p>
<p>The United Soybean Board, a U.S. lobby group funded by soybean growers, has said China should do away with its quota system and allow the market to rule.</p>
<p>The group is a supporter of China's bid to join the World Trade Organisation and the extension by Washington of Beijing's most-favoured nation trade status.</p>
<p>Soybean imports are currently subject to a three-percent import duty, but require no import license, an official of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp (COFCO) said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no restrictions on imports of soybeans,&quot; he told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>But he said there are plans to introduce tariff quotas on soybeans, limiting the amount that can be imported at three percent duty. Imports outside the quota will be subject to a 114 percent tariff.</p>
<p>China sets a 13 percent tariff rate on soybean oil imports and requires import permits, the COFCO official said.</p>
<p>China plans to set quota on soybean oil imports, imports within quota will be subjected to 13 percent and imports outside the quota will be 121.6 percent, he said.</p>
