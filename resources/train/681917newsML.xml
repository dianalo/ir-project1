<p>company ASG AB said on Monday it had no news on who would replace its chief executive officer, Gunnar Malm, who announced his resignation earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;The process has started but we don't know yet who will be our new CEO,&quot; ASG spokeswoman Caroline Rosen told Reuters.</p>
<p>On June 13 Malm said he would resign later this year. Malm, who has been CEO since 1993, said he would stay on until a replacement was found.</p>
<p>The share jumped five percent to 132 crowns immediately after Malm announced his resignation. At 0930 GMT on June 23 the share was trading at 131 crowns, up one crown on the previous session's close.</p>
<p>The company also said earlier this month the head of its air and sea freight division ASG Air &amp; Sea, Roger Olsson, would resign as of August 1. The company said the two resignations coming at the same time was only a coincidence.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement Malm said in a statement that the company had gone through several big changes in the past few years.</p>
<p>These changes included the acquisition of cold storage company Frigoscandia, the consolidation of European road traffic, the establishing of ASG Logistics and the building up of Nordic operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Through these changes ASG has a good platform which gives the possibility for good profitability in the future,&quot; Malm said.</p>
<p>ASG, a leading transportation and logistics company in the Nordic region, is involved in air, sea and overland freight.</p>
