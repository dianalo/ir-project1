<p>Spanish banks Santander and BCH said in a statement to Spain's stock market commission on Thursday they were in talks with Antena 3 to increase their participation in the television channel.</p>
<p>Telefonica earlier confirmed that it was negotiating for a stake in Antena 3.</p>
<p>BCH, which already has 10 percent of the private TV channel, said it was meeting with Telefonica and Antena 3 with the aim of &quot;directly or indirectly increasing its actual participation in the capital of Antena 3 de Television SA&quot;.</p>
<p>Santander, which has a 10 percent participation through its subsidiary Banesto , said it was in talks to buy a stake directly.</p>
<p>Local media reported on Thursday that Telefonica was seeking 25 percent of Antena 3 and a majority stake in a related company with television viewing rights for soccer matches.</p>
<p>The reports, which the participants would not confirm, said each bank would also end up with a 25 percent stake of Antena 3 in total.</p>
