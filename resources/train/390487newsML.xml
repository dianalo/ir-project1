<p>Czech chemical and industrial holding Chemapol Group a.s. said on Thursday its plan to issue global depositary receipts (GDR) would most likely not materialise before the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect we will enter the international markets. The GDR issue will be realised at the end of this year or later,&quot; the company's chairman Vaclav Junek told a presentation to analysts and jouralists.  </p>
<p>He added that Chemapol could convert existing shared into GDRs, eventhough the original plan last year was a minimum 600 million crown new issue.</p>
<p>The chairman said the firm planned to issue two to three billion crowns worth of bonds in a three-year issue, replacing existing issue which is coming due later this year.</p>
<p>The company said it expected its unconsolidated gross profit for 1996, before provisions, to be 658 million crowns, but in a statement said this would be lowered by some 300 to 350 million depending on reserves to d.</p>
<p>In 1995, the company had 62.5 million consolidated net profit. Comparative figures for unconsolidated profit were not available.</p>
<p>Junek said equity capial reached 2.5 billion crowns after a recent rights issue from 1.68 billion, and the company did not need to expand the basic capital at the moment.  </p>
<p>Junek said the firm had spent about 12 billion crowns on acquisitions in the recent years and in 1996 &quot;we invested about six or seven billion, that was the last and the largest wave,&quot;</p>
<p>He said payment for acquisitions made in the buying spree for the group -- which now includes major chemical companies, a small airline, a publishing house, an arms trading firm and sports franchises and clubs -- were not paid off immediately.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate on what payments were outstanding.</p>
<p>Junek said six newly-created subholdings, dealing with chemichal, communications, trading, distribution, real estate, and defence industry, will gradually take over all daughter companies currently owned by the holding.</p>
