<p>A California state Senate committee on Monday rejected a resolution that called on China to honor human rights in Hong Kong, according to the bill's author.</p>
<p>The strongly-worded resolution, introduced by Republican state Sen. Raymond Haynes, called on China to preserve the political, civil and economic liberties of the people of Hong Kong and to retain democracy and free markets.</p>
<p>The Democrat-controlled Senate Rules Committee killed the resolution on a three-to-two vote, Haynes said. Democratic legislators were not immediately available to comment on their reasons for killing the resolution.</p>
<p>Haynes plans to reintroduce the resolution on the Senate floor to force a vote on the issue, an aide said.</p>
<p>Chinese-American human rights activist Harry Wu, who spent 19 years in forced labor camps in China in the 1960s and 1970s, had endorsed the resolution.</p>
<p>The British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Communist-ruled China on July 1.</p>
<p>The resolution would have had no direct consequences if approved by the state legislature. But Haynes said the measure would have sent a message to Beijing and could have prompted other states to take similar actions.</p>
<p>A second resolution introduced by Haynes accused China of religious persecution, but that measure has yet to be considered by state lawmakers.</p>
