<headline>EU against unilateral secondary embargoes--Brittan.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said on Monday that the European Union is ready to work with Washington to settle a dispute over investment in Cuba but remains opposed to unilateral secondary embargoes.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Union is ready to work for a comprehensive settlement, but we will not abandon our opposition to unilateral secondary embargoes,&quot; Brittan said in a speech to a conference on trans-Atlantic relations.  </p>
<p>The United States and European Union agreed last month to try to settle their differences over the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which is aimed at discouraging foreign investment in Cuba, by mid-October.</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to negotiate a common policy on properties seized by Cuba's communist government after Fidel Castro took power in 1959. As part of the deal, the United States agreed to continue waiving a provision of the law that allows U.S. citizens to sue investors in property seized by the Cuban government.  </p>
<p>As a common policy on confiscated property is set in place, the White House is to seek a change in a provision of the law that bars executives of companies investing in disputed properties in Cuba from entering the United States.</p>
<p>The EU agreed to set aside a World Trade Organization challenge against the law.</p>
<p>Brittan is scheduled to meet Undersecretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat on Tuesday to discuss the proposal and is also scheduled to talk with a number of members of Congress during his Washington visit.  </p>
<p>Brittan also told the group he wanted a series of agreements to harmonize regulations between the two trading partners to be completed by the end of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;We must make every effort to achieve this at the EU/U.S. summit in The Hague later this month,&quot; Brittan said. The summit is set for May 28.</p>
<p>The agreements cover standards and testing for telecommunications equipment, electrical products and electromagnetic capabilities, pleasure boats and veterinary medicine. Negotiators are still trying to work out differences in two other areas covering pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p>
