<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch call climbs on new secured loans quota.</title>
<headline>Dutch call climbs on new secured loans quota.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The beginning of a 35-day secured loans quota, replacing a three-month one, pushed Dutch call money higher on Friday, as market players were on their guard because the new quota was much shorter than usual.</p>
<p>&quot;With such a short secured loans pact, people are a little bit more careful,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Call money was trading at between 3.06 and 3.18 percent, up from 2.12/25 percent bid/ask on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Overnight money traded at unusually low levels in recent days ahead of the expiry of the old quota.</p>
<p>One dealer said call rates were likely to continue hovering around slightly higher levels during the 35-day quota, although they were set to come down a little on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said it was hard to judge whether this morning's 2.8 billion guilder allocation under a new special advances pact was ample or not, due to the very short secured loans quota.</p>
<p>Another said the allocation had initially seemed rather tight, but this would be alleviated as the central bank was expected to bring some additional funds on to the market next week.</p>
<p>Other money market rates were unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had quietened down compared to earlier this week when call money trade was more volatile.</p>
<p>They reported little or no activity in Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs).</p>
<p>The guilder was trading at a steady 112.404 per 100 marks.</p>
