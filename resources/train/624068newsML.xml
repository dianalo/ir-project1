<title>USA: NY precious metals called to open mixed.</title>
<headline>NY precious metals called to open mixed.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were called to open mixed Thursday, with platinum and palladium expected to begin unchanged following sharp gains in New York Wednesday which propelled palladium to its highest in about 17 years.</p>
<p>White metals prices remained firm overnight amid tight supplies despite an end to a wildcat strike at the Rustenburg mine in South Africa with little loss of production.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold was called $0.50 to $1.00 firmer as the market mulled the effect of a dispute between the German government and Bundesbank over revaluation.  </p>
<p>Gold showed no immediate strong reaction to the Bundesbank's announcement Wednesday that it disagreed with Bonn's revaluation plan, but the Government said later it will proceed regardless.</p>
<p>The dollar, however, surged Thursday as the row in Germany heightened concerns in the run up to the European single currency.</p>
<p>London bullion was fixed this morning at $345.70 an ounce, up from $342.80 Wednesday afternoon. Bullion was quoted by dealers at $345.00/50.</p>
<p>COMEX July silver was called flat to off 1.0 cent.</p>
<p>June gold traded from $346.40 to $345.00 and July silver from to $4.74 to $4.72 on ACCESS.</p>
<p>The main focus in overnight precious metals dealings was on platinum and palladium as nervousness in a tight physical market continued to push prices higher.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum and NYMEX June palladium were called unchanged.</p>
