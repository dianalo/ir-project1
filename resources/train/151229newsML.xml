<p>A key Orange County, Calif., panel failed to approve a plan to refund nearly $200 million of taxable pension bonds, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The county's Public Finance Advisory Committee split 2-to-2 on the proposed refunding, county officials said. The committee was short one member when the vote was taken.</p>
<p>&quot;There are budgetary reasons why we want to get this thing passed,&quot; said Gary Burton, Orange County's assistant chief executive officer. &quot;This may only be a temporary setback.&quot;</p>
<p>The advisory panel will reconsider the proposal on Nov 7.  </p>
<p>County officials said the proposal calls for the county to sell up to $200 million of debt to refund outstanding pension obligation bonds. MBIA Insurance, a unit of MBIA Inc, has already agreed to insure the proposed debt.</p>
<p>Before the county Board of Supervisors can consider the proposed refunding, it must be approved by the advisory committee, which is composed of three members of the public, the county auditor-controller and the county's chief executive officer.</p>
