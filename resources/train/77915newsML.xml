<p>Several British doctors stepped into a growing debate over abortion on Friday, declaring that women who want to terminate their pregnancies should not fear that the foetus is suffering.</p>
<p>In a clear message to anti-abortion groups which have presented videotape of foetuses twitching and apparently grimacing in the womb, the doctors said unborn babies could not feel pain.</p>
<p>Several papers in the British Medical Journal addressed the issue and their consensus was that foetuses' nervous systems were not advanced enough to experience pain, at least not before about 17 weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Can a foetus feel pain? Given the definitions of feeling and pain the answer must be no,&quot; wrote Adrian Lloyd-Thomas of London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for children and Maria Fitzgerald of University College London.</p>
<p>Babies showed reflexes to what could be painful stimuli, they said, but did not have enough brain development to register this consciously.</p>
<p>&quot;Scientific evidence suggests women considering abortion can be assured that foetuses do not experience pain in the way that people who oppose abortion claim,&quot; said Dr Stuart Derbyshire of the University of Manchester.</p>
<p>Vivette Glover and Nicholas Fisk of Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in London said no one really knew if or when a foetus became conscious, so it would be better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of pain or suffering during termination of pregnancy is especially difficult,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Terminations are usually carried out before 20 weeks, when it is particularly uncertain whether the foetus feels anything at all. It may feel something, however, especially towards mid-gestation.&quot;</p>
<p>Doctors used to say that new born babies could not feel pain, but studies have since shown that they do.</p>
<p>But the doctors, all paediatricians, obstetricians or neurologists, writing in the British Medical Journal said foetuses were different from newborns.</p>
<p>The abortion debate has come to the fore in Britain since recent reports of a woman who had one healthy twin aborted but kept another.</p>
<p>A second woman who took fertility drugs announced she would try to carry eight foetuses to term.</p>
<p>Doctors say the second woman should have some of the foetuses aborted to prevent them all dying. Anti-abortion groups have been very vocal in their opposition, demanding a re-think of Britain's abortion laws.</p>
<p>&quot;These articles are a useful balance to what has been, until now, a hysterical and ill-informed discussion,&quot; said Ann Furedi of the Birth Control Trust charity.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctors are not sadists. They perform abortions to relieve the suffering of women, not because they wish to inflict suffering on foetuses.&quot;</p>
