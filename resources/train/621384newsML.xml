<title>USA: Smith Barney puts New England director on leave.</title>
<headline>Smith Barney puts New England director on leave.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The head of Smith Barney Inc's New England operation was put on administrative leave, the firm said, but it declined comment on reports it was probing political contributions raised by the regional director.</p>
<p>&quot;Robert Maloney has been placed on administrative leave and we're looking into the matter,&quot; Sally Cates, a spokeswoman for Smith Barney, which is part of Travelers Group Inc, told Reuters Wednesday.</p>
<p>She declined to say why the firm did this.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe on Wednesday said the New York-based securities firm was looking into political contributions Robert Maloney raised for his brother, a Connecticut congressman. James Maloney last November defeated Republican Representative Gary Franks.</p>
<p>An unamed source told the paper he understood Smith Barney was checking whether Robert Maloney compensated contributing employees with salary enhancements or other favors. Individuals can contribute up to $2,000 per election to a candidate.</p>
<p>The paper said Federal Election Commission records show firm employees gave $3,000 to James Maloney for his last November election, and contributed $39,000 to his campaign for a losing bid in the 1994 election.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Commission told the paper an executive can solicit contributions from executive and administrative personnel at his or her company.</p>
