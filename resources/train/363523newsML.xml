<p>The United States and Russia were expected to announce on Friday a site for a March summit in Europe between President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the White House said.</p>
<p>Spokesman Mike McCurry said Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had made progress on the summit during their discussions here and were to report to Clinton at midday. An announcement of the date and summit site was expected with a European locale likely, he said without offering details.</p>
<p>It is Yeltsin's turn to visit the United States, since Clinton went to Moscow for the last summit in April. But U.S. officials have been receptive to suggestions the summit be moved to a third country closer to Russia because of Yeltsin's slow recovery from heart bypass surgery and pneumonia.</p>
<p>The Russian news agency Itar-Tass news agency reported on Friday that a change of venue to Europe was one of several possibilities Yeltsin was considering.</p>
