<p>The Commerce Department announced on Monday it was changing its methods for sampling monthly retail sales to try to make the report more accurate.</p>
<p>The department's Census Bureau, which collects the data, will issue the first estimates from the new sample on June 25 when it will, among other things, issue revised May retail sales estimates. On June 12, Commerce said May retail sales had fallen 0.1 percent, a third straight monthly decline.</p>
<p>Commerce said the new sampling method should improve the quality of the monthly retail sales estimates, which are frequently revised substantially in following months.</p>
<p>It said all 13,000 firms surveyed in future will be asked to report their sales every month, whereas in the past some were asked to report only every three months.</p>
<p>Out of the 13,000 firms reporting their sales, about 4,300 also will be asked to report their monthly investories.</p>
<p>&quot;The new sample design is expected to improve estimates by reducing revisions between the preliminary and final retail sales and inventory figures,&quot; Commerce said.</p>
