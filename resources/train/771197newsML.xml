<p>Three Indonesian soldiers were killed in a clash with pro-independence guerrillas in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, military sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The soldiers were killed in an attack in the Liquisa district, west of the territory's capital Dili, on Wednesday morning, one source said.  </p>
<p>Further information on the clash was not immediately available.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, it's true, but for further information you will have to speak to military district's chief-of-staff,&quot; an officer in the information section of the East Timor military region told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and is still battling a small group of around 200 guerrillas opposing its rule in the territory.</p>
<p>Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 although the act has still not been recognised by the United Nations, which regards former colonial ruler Portugal as being the administering power.</p>
