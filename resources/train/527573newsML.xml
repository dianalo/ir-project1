<p>The two Russians and one American orbiting earth on Russia's Mir space station may have to abandon it if they cannot solve a series of technical problems, a spokesman for mission control said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Viktor Blagov said that at the moment there was no reason to evacuate Mir, but added: &quot;The team is continuing its repairs. It's a difficult task and if it cannot be solved Mir might be abandoned by the cosmonauts.&quot;  </p>
<p>Blagov, deputy head of the flight programme, told a news conference that the cosmonauts had repaired two of three leaks in the station's cooling system with special glue but had yet to find the third leak, through which antifreeze was escaping into the station's air supply.</p>
<p>&quot;It's on the limit of what is acceptable,&quot; he said, adding that it was not clear how dangerous the concentration of antifreeze vapour was. &quot;We immediately told NASA about the defects on the station and the American specialists are kept continually informed about what is happening on Mir,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said that an urgent evacuation of the cosmonauts could be ordered from earth or by the commander of the crew.</p>
<p>&quot;That could happen if there's a big fire on the station or if there is decompression,&quot; Blagov said, adding that the men could reach earth in an hour using the Soyuz rocket which is now docked with Mir.</p>
