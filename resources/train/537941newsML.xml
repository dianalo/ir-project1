<p>The Internet is brimming with raw and refined information of interest to the business traveller.</p>
<p>Anyone flying into a strange city, grabbing a rental car and looking for a precise route to a location knows that maps handed out at the rental counter can be short on detail.</p>
<p>There's help available on the Worldwide Web at www.mapquest.com -- and it's free.</p>
<p>The site offers driving instructions between 150,000 towns in North America as well as door-to-door driving directions for 34 metropolitan areas within the United States.</p>
<p>When the user enters a request for a specific door-to-door route there are written directions -- &quot;turn left on Vine, go one block on River, right on Green Boulevard to the Interstate 90 ramp&quot; -- as well as maps that can be printed out.</p>
<p>Perry Evans, president of MapQuest Publishing, a business unit of GeoSystems Global Corp., told Reuters the site gets about 80,000 requests a day for driving instructions, and about half of those are detailed point-to-point directions that are used much the same way drivers use one of those flip over map routes provided by motor clubs.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that people are using us on a very regular basis for getting from point A to point B,&quot; he said. &quot;And we want to make this a richer experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Their enriched information, he said, will be both consumer friendly and bring in revenue for his company. He said Radisson Hotels, as an example, recently signed up with a list of its properties which will pop up in the driving instructions any time the selected route passes within a certain distance of one of them.</p>
<p>There are similar possibilities for including other commercial travel information such as the location of nearby filling stations.</p>
<p>How long will this kind of information remain free?</p>
<p>Evans said he believes the service will continue to be free to consumers &quot;at some level&quot; for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>That may be possible because of the revenue from commercials ties. The Sabre Group, for instance, recently chose MapQuest for use on its Travelocity Web site -- www.travelocity.com -- a location which describes itself as the leader in online reservation services.</p>
<p>Online travel may be the place to hitch a wagon.</p>
<p>A new report from Jupiter Communications estimates that revenues of $276 million were generated by online travel bookings last year for air, hotel, car rental, cruises and vacation packages.</p>
<p>It expects that figure to increase threefold this year and rise to $4.5 billion by the end of the year 2000.</p>
