<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan dollar ends softer on Fed rate hike.</title>
<headline>Taiwan dollar ends softer on Fed rate hike.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-03-26</dateline>

<p>The Taiwan dollar finished softer on Wednesday in the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter-point overnight interest rate increase, but persistent foreign funds inflows muted the downtrend, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit finished at T$27.570, back from an intra-day low of T$27.588, against Tuesday's T$27.565 close.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was an active US$207 million.</p>
<p>Inflows of foreign equity funds for the stock market slowed the Taiwan dollar's fall, dealers said.  </p>
<p>In a widely anticipated move, the U.S. central bank raised the key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.50 percent -- the first increase since Feb. 1, 1995 -- in an effort to stay a step ahead of inflation. The federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's reaction was moderate because the market already had anticipated the Fed's rate hikes,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people expect the Fed to further raise the rates in the near term,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>In addition to the U.S. dollar's general strength overseas, dealers said a slowing domestic economy, dampened by an outbreak of the deadly hog foot-and-mouth disease, would pull the Taiwan dollar further lower.</p>
<p>Economists and officials have predicted the farm epidemic and a resulting ban on pork exports could shave half a percentage point from Taiwan's 1997 economic growth rate, pulling it back below 6.0 percent to erase a hard-won fourth quarter acceleration.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected a range of T$27.55-60 for the Taiwan dollar on Thursday. -- Alice Hung (2-5080815)</p>
