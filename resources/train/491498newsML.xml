<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday opened the door to a resumption of cross-party talks on tax reforms aimed at tackling record post-war unemployment and getting state finances into shape for Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the momentum he gained by announcing he would stand for a record fifth term next year, Kohl said he was ready personally to join a new round of talks with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD).</p>
<p>&quot;If the SPD thinks we must discuss the tax reforms in a big group to achieve a result ... then I have no objections,&quot; he said before a meeting of Christian Democrat (CDU) leaders, who unanimously endorsed his re-election bid, announced last week.</p>
<p>Both sides met earlier this year to seek a compromise deal on Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plans to cut income and corporate tax by 30 billion marks ($17.8 billion) over the next two years.</p>
<p>But, after only two meetings, the SPD walked out in protest at separate government plans to cut coal subsidies.</p>
<p>The SPD has since refused to resume talks with Waigel, whom it accuses of leaving a 50 billion mark gap in his fiscal sums which would throw into doubt Germany's compliance with the borrowing requirements of European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Kohl had also rebuffed SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine's calls for a one-on-one meeting.</p>
<p>The SPD has the power to scupper the Kohl coalition's tax reforms through its control over the upper house of parliament -- but is reluctant to be seen playing a spoiling game with 4.7 million Germans on the dole, the most since 1933.</p>
<p>The party's parliamentary leader, Rudolf Scharping, said he was ready to restart the talks immediately. &quot;We can talk again this evening if Kohl wants to,&quot; he said before a party meeting.</p>
<p>But the SPD repeated earlier demands for a drop in occupational insurance charges from July, a lightening of the tax burden for workers in 1998 and an explanation of how Waigel would plug the huge financing gap arising from tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;If the coalition moves in those three points, then I see no problem,&quot; SPD finance spokeswoman Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier told Tuesday's Express newspaper.</p>
<p>CDU general secretary Peter Hintze told reporters that the whole tax reform should be passed through the Bundestag lower house of parliament before the summer break -- whether or not the SPD was ready to resume talks.</p>
<p>Waigel also said that if a tax &quot;summit&quot; did go ahead, the chances of striking a compromise on his reforms by the summer would increase. But he criticised the SPD for holding up the negotiating process for the best part of a month.</p>
<p>In the initial talks both sides found common ground on cutting the entry rate of income tax to below 20 percent from 26 percent now and on slashing the main corporation tax rate to 35 percent from 47 percent.</p>
<p>But the SPD opposed Waigel's bid to slash the top rate of income tax to 39 percent from 53 percent.</p>
<p>Waigel said, however, that he saw room for compromise on the controversial issue of scrapping tax relief on unsocial work hours and on raising value added taxes to offset cuts in direct taxation.</p>
