<p>European bourses weakened and the dollar fell sharply on Wednesday as investors got the jitters before a speech by U.S. central bank chief Alan Greenspan which could signal the direction of interest rates.</p>
<p>Stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris, which have all hit new peaks in recent weeks, began trading in subdued mood, encouraged by a strong close on Wall Street on Tuesday but with investors reluctant to take big positions before the speech.</p>
<p>Currency markets saw the liveliest trading with the dollar dropping by nearly two yen and one pfennig as traders awaited the keynote speech before the Senate Banking Committee starting at 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>They will be watching for any hint on interest rates as Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, speaks on the health of the U.S. economy which frequently sets the pace for global growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think he'll change his stance signficantly. The Fed are biased to tighten and he'll reflect that in his comments, and say that with growth as strong as it is, the danger is that there'll be some signs of inflation in the future,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt of Chase Investment Bank.</p>
<p>The dollar's kneejerk reaction to any hint of inflation or upward pressure on rates would further weaken the U.S. currency, many said. &quot;The dollar's immediate reaction to any word on higher interest rates would be negative, because it will follow the bond and equities markets,&quot; said David Bloom, currency strategist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;And that I think is the main point, that the dollar will take its lead from the asset markets (after Greenspan's testimony).&quot;</p>
<p>The currency market would also be very wary of any remark about U.S. stock prices following Greenspan's comment last December about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in U.S. asset markets, which caused a temporary nose-dive in stocks on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Although Greenspan may warn about strengthening U.S. stocks, there was doubt as to whether such a comment would drive down the market as much as it did last time, Chase's Schmidt said.</p>
<p>In London, stocks see-sawed in early trading and analysts said any big gains would be limited ahead of Greenspan's testimony to Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people are unduly worried about Greenspan,&quot; a dealer said, noting the weaker tone of recent U.S. economic data. &quot;But his comments will keep everyone waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>The FTSE index climbed just into the plus column by midmorning.</p>
<p>In Paris, French stocks opened lower, weighed down by a weaker bond market that is trading quietly lower ahead of Greenspan's testimony. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 0.31 percent in early trade while the CAC-40 futures contract was down eight points at 2,599.</p>
<p>Frankfurt shares also slipped in and out of profit and traders said the market was unlikely to show much change before the afternoon, dealers said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6693 marks and 120.62 yen, compared with 1.6786 and 122.24 in late European trade on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was up 2.6 points at 4,347.3.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 fell 5.76 points to 2,601.61.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was up 0.60 points at 3,233.70.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>Gold was at $354.50 an ounce in early trading compared with $353.35 at the London close on Tuesday.</p>
