<headline>INTERVIEW - Cisco sees acquisitions.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-09-26</dateline>

<p>Cisco Systems Inc said on Thursday it was emphatically remaining on the acquisition trail and saw a potential six to 10 buys a year, funded out of its $1.0 billion cash pile and via its shares.</p>
<p>Cisco president John Chambers, in the Netherlands to announce a new European administration center, said in an interview acquisitions remained central to Cisco's strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;We will probably acquire a minimum of six, probably closer to 10, companies a year,&quot; he said, indicating it was unlikely that anything on the horizon would match April's $4.0 billion swoop for switching equipment firm StrataCom.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will probably not make many public acquisitions.  Most of the companies we try to acquire are new technology areas that we can quickly turn into products and move through our channels,&quot; said Chambers.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got $40 billion of market cap, we use our stock to buy companies and we've got a billion dollars in cash and we use part of our cash to buy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cisco, which has made more than 80 percent of the routers used to direct traffic on the Internet, sees acquisitions as vital as Internet business consolidates -- filling in the gaps left by its own substantial research and development effort.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're spending $600 million in research and development this next year,&quot; said Chambers.  &quot;There are so many opportunities for growth you just cannot do it yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>And the dizzying pace of growth in the Internet market means acquisitions are vital.  &quot;We don't talk about our business in terms of year over year; we talk in terms of quarters.  You see, just unbelievable evolution in speed in the market is required to survive,&quot; said Chambers.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't partner, you can't grow fast in this industry.  If you don't acquire and be good at your acquiring, you can't grow fast enough.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said Cisco's strategy was being watched closely throughout the industry and was viewed as a model for growth -- although he stressed the company had no hidden secret formula, merely a set of fairly simple rules.</p>
<p>&quot;When you acquire you're really acquiring people.  If you don't keep the people you're not going to be successful. We're usually acquiring next generation products, not what they generally have,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chemistry between the potential partners is also vital, otherwise new combines could unwittingly begin to compete with each other, dooming a venture to failure.  </p>
<p>&quot;As corny as it sounds, the most important element is chemistry.  If your chemistry or your cultures are different, you don't touch it.  If you're doing large company acquisitions geographic proximity is very important, as it allows you to combine companies effectively,&quot; Chambers said.</p>
<p>If Cisco did have a &quot;secret weapon&quot; it would be its low &quot;attrition&quot; rate, the rate at which it loses employees, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;People like being acquired by Cisco.  We get an opportunity to acquire 50 times more companies than we acquire.  People usually solicit us.  When our competitors start to buy a company I usually get a call from the company saying we'd rather be acquired by you,&quot; he said.</p>
