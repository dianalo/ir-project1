<p>Zambian police arrested 10 students after using teargas and batons to break up riots at the University of Zambia on Monday, the campus administration said.</p>
<p>Zambia's biggest university also expelled nine students and suspended another after two days of rioting, during which protesters vandalised the university campus and stoned vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;In line with management's firm resolve to bring an end to all acts in indiscipline in the university, nine students have been expelled with immediate effect. A tenth student has been expelled for one academic year,&quot; the university administration said in a statement.</p>
<p>The street rampages started on Sunday night. Riot police were sent to the campus on Monday and fought pitched battles with scores of stone-throwing students, finally driving them back with teargas.</p>
<p>University spokesman Mulife Malambo told Reuters students were unhappy over delays in the disbursement of book allowances.</p>
<p>&quot;We have told the students that the university is not responsible for their allowances. The government is,&quot; Malambo said. &quot;However, the students have decided to call for a class boycott and the normal schedule has been disrupted,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Last November the university was closed for several weeks due to student riots sparked by a protests against the way general elections, boycotted by seven opposition parties, had been organised.</p>
<p>President Frederick Chiluba's Movement for Multi-party Democracy won the November election, but the poll results were dismissed by international observers as flawed.</p>
<p>Students at Zambia's second university on Monday urged the government to pay meal and food allowances which they said were two weeks overdue.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are starving and their morale to go to classes is very low. Government should immediately pay us the money,&quot; said a student leader at the Copperbelt University.</p>
