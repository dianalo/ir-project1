<title>SWITZERLAND: Zaire rebels block UN flight to refugee camps.</title>

<p>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said Tutsi-dominated rebels in east Zaire blocked an aid flight on Wednesday to sealed off Rwandan Hutu camps and voiced concern about the safety of the refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;We're extremely worried. We're now being denied access both by road and by air,&quot; said UNHCR spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the amount of anti-refugee propaganda floating in the area, anything is possible. It's possible there may have been some kind of violence against the refugees.&quot;</p>
<p>UNHCR chief Sadako Ogata has accused the rebels of blocking a plan to repatriate the refugees by plane. Ogata said this week the rebels began a military operation in the refugee area and sealed off the camps south of the eastern city of Kisangani.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Zairean villagers said the rebels slaughtered many Rwandan refugees at a camp south of Kisangani on Tuesday in revenge for the killing of six villagers.</p>
<p>It is not known if the refugees are still in the camps.</p>
<p>The Hutus fled Rwanda in 1994 and are collectively accused by minority Tutsis of genocide in Rwanda in the same year.</p>
<p>More than half a million Hutus went home last year after the rebels overran their camps but others fled deep into Zaire.</p>
<p>They arrived at their present location in mid-March after six months trekking over volcanic rock and through bush and jungle in a vain attempt to flee the Tutsi-backed rebels.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila bowed to international pressure on April 5 and agreed to a U.N. sponsored operation to repatriate about 100,000 Rwandan refugees at Kasese and further south towards Ubundu.</p>
<p>Since then, the airlift plan has failed to start.</p>
<p>Aid officials privately say that the rebels are delaying the repatriation plan because Rwanda, which supports the rebels, is not keen on receiving many more returnees. They say they suspect the rebels were behind many of the problems in Kisangani.</p>
