<p>French animal feed producers have been putting 11.8 percent more grain into their compounds than last year, with barley showing the strongest gains, French cereals office ONIC said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The figures are for usage between the start of the crop marketing year on July 1, 1996, and the beginning of January, 1997, the latest period for which data is available.</p>
<p>ONIC said total grain use in compound feed was just under 4.6 million tonnes, up 11.8 percent from 4.1 million tonnes in the year-before period.</p>
<p>Barley showed the strongest annual increase of 43.4 percent to reach 550,100 tonnes.</p>
<p>Soft wheat gained 5.6 percent and maize 18.3 percent.</p>
<p>The figures confirm provisional figures supplied by industry sources last week.</p>
<p>Over the same six months, total compound feed production which includes grain and other fodder was up 5.2 percent, ONIC said in a monthly report.</p>
<p>ONIC said that imports of corn gluten feed had fallen sharply over a slightly shorter period to 63,700 tonnes from 127,000 tonnes a year earlier.</p>
<p>ONIC officials said however that corn gluten imports were recovering following the clearance of gene-modified maize from the United States and this had yet to show up in the figures.</p>
<p>For the whole season between July and June, ONIC projects a 12 percent increase in total cereals usage for manufactured feed to some 9.4 million tonnes from 8.37 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>ONIC gave the following breakdown of grain use in manufactured feed in thousands of tonnes.</p>
