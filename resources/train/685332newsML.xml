<p>The zloty inched up in early Wednesday trade as banks cut currency positions for the weekend and so far the Polish unit has remained immune to controversy surrounding next year's budget, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some currency selling in early trade with the zloty mainly tracking dollar/mark rates...and so far strongly worded statements about next year's budget have not had any effect,&quot; said Karol Zaluski of ING Bank in Warsaw.</p>
<p>At 0850 GMT the zloty was at 1.54/1.51 percent from parity, up from opening at 1.53/1.47. It was 3.2338/42 per dollar, flat from opening and at 1.8800/10 per mark, up from 1.8805/35.  </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Poland needed to balance the budget by 1999 at the latest and quickly tighten its monetary policy to keep its quicKly widening current account and trade deficit capped.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the central bank said that Poland needed to balance next year's budget in order to avoid a Czech-style financial crisis, but the government dismissed its advice and said it would not cut 1998 spending before September elections.</p>
<p>Dealers expected yields to rise at Wednesday's 600 million zloty 52-week T-bill auction, the last tender this week, to around 21.65-21.70 percent from Monday's 21.62 percent.  </p>
<p>On the money market one-day rates held just below the 25-percent lombard rate as the market turned dry during the last week of the monthly reserve period, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight rates were flat from opening levels at 24.40/24.95 percent, while tomorrow/next were at 24.40/24.90 percent at 0920 GMT, up from Tuesday's 22.75/22.90.</p>
