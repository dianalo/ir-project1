<p>Marathon talks between states and the tobacco industry on a settlement of lawsuits were making progress and an agreement could be reached on Thursday, a leading negotiator for the states said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made progress on the three issues,&quot; Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said. He was referring to demands from the states that the industry agree to some punishment for past actions, that it accept some liability for damages and that it agree to increased regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  </p>
<p>Moore told reporters that negotiators for the states would keep working through the night and into Thursday, adding, &quot;Maybe we will have something for you by tomorrow afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>State attorneys general threatened on Tuesday to walk away from the negotiations if their three main demands were not met. The two sides have been meeting since April to try to reach a settlement of huge claims against the industry.</p>
<p>Moore struck a more optimistic chord after talks all day at a Washington hotel on Wednesday. He said state attorneys general did not want to abandon the talks because the tobacco industry had made important concessions on health-related issues.</p>
<p>&quot;The attorneys general are not going to walk away from future generations of our children,&quot; Moore said. Forty U.S. states have sued the tobacco industry to recoup the costs of health care for smokers.</p>
