<p>Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG on Tuesday reported group net profit of 1.8 billion marks ($1.1 billion) in 1996 on group sales of 63.1 billion marks, figures that analysts said were better than expected.</p>
<p>Europe's largest telecommunications company released the figures ahead of its first results news conference since the government sold a 25 percent stake in Telekom in November and analysts said the strong figures should propel the share price higher.</p>
<p>Telekom AG said its profit on ordinary activities in 1996 was 6.6 billion marks. The company gave no comparisons for the previous year, but it was expected to provide adjusted 1995 data at the news conference later in the day.</p>
<p>The 1996 data reflected the first year that Telekom paid value added tax. The company said its 1995 figures need to be adjusted as if the tax were paid in order to provide comparisons with 1996.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement that it reduced its liabilities by 12 billion marks in 1996, of which 1.2 billion marks were paid before becoming due. Telekom reduced its debt by another 2.6 billion marks in the first quarter and now has just under 80 billion marks in debt.</p>
<p>The workforce fell by 12,500 employees to 201,000 at the end of December.</p>
<p>Commenting on the first quarter of 1997, Telekom said preliminary data showed group sales rose eight percent to 16.3 billion marks and pre-tax profit was 2.2 billion marks. It gave no comparisons.</p>
<p>The workforce totalled 199,000 employees at the end of March, down 2,000 from the end of December. The company plans to reduce the workforce to 170,000 by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Telekom also repeated its goal of paying a dividend of 1.20 marks on 1997 results after 60 pfennigs in 1996.</p>
<p>The company is majority-owned by the German government, but over 25 percent of its capital was listed on stock exchanges in November.</p>
<p>Jurgen Elfers, telecoms analyst at BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said Telekom's share price should continue their bullish trend of recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;I can imagine that shares will move in the direction of 45 marks,&quot; Elfers said. &quot;Based on what the (Deutsche Telekom chairman) Ron Sommer has said about doubling ordinary profit, we are now looking at a figure of over 13 billion marks for 1997. That means that the estimates on the market are far too low.&quot;</p>
<p>Telekom's share price, which surged five percent on Monday to an all-time high of 41.95 marks, was down slightly on Tuesday at 40.25 marks.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said they expect to revise forecasts on Telekom's 1997 earnings outlook upwards after a meeting with the company on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was looking closely at the increase in volumes in the first quarter. This is a very good number,&quot; said Thomas Koebel of BfG Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really probable that earnings estimates will be revised upwards,&quot; said Koebel. &quot;We will wait initially for the analysts meeting. But the sales growth looks very good.&quot;</p>
