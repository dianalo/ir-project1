<title>USA: US debate set to begin on Internet copyright bills.</title>
<headline>US debate set to begin on Internet copyright bills.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation  this week to implement two controversial international treaties intended  to protect copyrighted material on the Internet, but the bills immediately  reignited a debate from last year.</p>
<p>The World Intellectual Property Organization adopted the two treaties  in December after much argument between companies, like movie studios  and record publishers, that produce copyrighted works and consumers  and users of such works including scientists, libraries and Internet  companies.</p>
<p>Utah Republican Oren Hatch and three other senators introduced implementing  legislation in the Senate late Thursday. On Tuesday, Rep. Howard Coble,  Republican of North Carolina, and three other representatives filed  an identical bill in the House.</p>
<p>&quot;The WIPO standards will raise the minimum standards for copyright  protection worldwide, providing the U.S. with the tools it needs to  combat international piracy,&quot; Hatch said.</p>
<p>The Senate must ratify the treaties on a two-thirds vote and both  the House and Senate must approve the implementing legislation before  the proposals become binding U.S. law.</p>
<p>Both treaties, one covering literary and artistic works, and the other  for recorded music, are supposed to extend the rights of copyright  holders into cyberspace while preserving free &quot;fair use&quot; of the material.</p>
<p>Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America,  said the treaties were &quot;vital to allowing our industry to move confidently  into the next century.&quot;</p>
<p>But many groups are still unhappy with the balance struck in the treaties  between the competing interests. Jonathan Band, a legal expert in  copyright law who represented some of the opponents, said the implementing  legislation was &quot;very poorly drafted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will have the practical effect of sharply curtailing many of the  (current) limitations and exceptions to the Copyright Act,&quot; Band,  a partner at Morrison &amp; Foerster in Washington, said.</p>
<p>Hatch said the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, would  hold hearings on the treaties shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to see the treaties go into effect this year and I will  try hard to meet this goal,&quot; he said. &quot;However, the late date on which  the administration has submitted the legislation may render this goal  unachievable.&quot;</p>
