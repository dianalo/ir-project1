<p>JOHNS DEFENDS WHITLAM LECTURE DECISION</p>
<p>ABC Managing Director, Brian Johns, has admitted the way the Whitlam Lecture was televised was flawed.</p>
<p>The lecture's broadcast, by ABC Television, has caused a political storm because the program was supplied by the ACTU, a fact the ABC's broadcast didn't acknowledge.</p>
<p>Mr Johns says this was an error, but says the broadcast was justified because the lecture, by former Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was an event of national significance.</p>
<p>He says he's under no pressure to resign.</p>

<p>GOVT &quot;SINISTER&quot; OVER ABC's WHITLAM LECTURE</p>
<p>The Federal Government's been accused of trying to destroy the ABC's independence by criticising the broadcaster's decision to televise the Whitlam Lecture.</p>
<p>The national broadcaster, and its Managing Director, Brian Johns, have been criticised for screening the A-C-T-U-sponsored lecture without revealing the source of the program.</p>
<p>Federal Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, says the criticism is part of a wider agenda to wreck the A-B-C.</p>
<p>Mr Johns has defended the broadcast, but says way the lecture went to air was flawed.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley says the Government's refusal to say whether it's satisfied with Mr Johns' explanation is sinister.</p>

<p>BESIEGED ABC BOSS GETS SUPPORT FROM CHAIRMAN</p>
<p>ABC Chairman, Donald McDonald, has come out in support of Managing Director, Brian Johns.</p>
<p>Mr McDonald says in a statement that the broadcaster's board is satisfied with the answers provided to questions on the Whitlam lecture raised by Senator Alston.</p>
<p>He says there was no external influence on the decision to air the program, and that Mr Johns is appropriately handling the flaws identified in the commissioning process.</p>

<p>COLSTON TO SUE FORMER STAFFER FOR DEFAMATION</p>
<p>Independent Senator, Mal Colston says he intends to sue a former staffer for defamation following claims the Senator abused his parliamentary allowances.</p>
<p>Former media advisor, Andrew Hillard, claims Senator Colston converted stamps to cash, kept gifts to Australia from overseas governments for himself, and employed family members to work in his office, when they did no work.</p>
<p>The allegations first arose in 1994, at an Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearing into the sacking of another of the Senator's staff.</p>
<p>Mr Hillard told ABC Radio he reported the matter through the proper channels giving the Senator his right of reply to the allegations.</p>
<p>Senator Colston has rejected the claims.</p>

<p>CALLS FOR NATIONAL SUMMIT ON LEGAL AID FUNDING</p>
<p>There are calls this morning for a national summit on legal aid funding, and for the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter.</p>
<p>The calls come from the New South Wales Premier and shadow Federal Attorney General, and follow reports that a man facing serious drug charges could go free after because he hasn't yet been granted legal aid for a second trial.</p>
<p>Ivan Marini's first trial ended with a hung jury.</p>
<p>Federal Attorney General Darryl Williams says Mr Marini can apply for funding, and his application will be considered in due course.</p>
<p>Bob Carr says the states are hurting since the Commonwealth clawed 120-million dollars out of the legal aid system.</p>

<p>CROC VICTIM FACES 6-to-8 WEEKS IN HOSPITAL</p>
<p>The father of the north Queensland animal handler crushed by a crocodile at a tourist attraction last Friday says she appears to be recovering well.</p>
<p>Twenty-two year old Karla Bredl is in a stable condition in Mackay Base Hospital's intensive care unit with a broken thigh and pelvic injuries.</p>
<p>Ms Bredl was bitten by a four metre crocodile after slipping while feeding it at the Whitsunday Wildlife Park.</p>
<p>Doctors say it could be six to eight weeks before she's released.</p>
<p>Her father, Joe Bredl, says she hasn't said much about her ordeal, but did say she remembered what had happened when he asked her.</p>

<p>CALL TO COMPENSATE CASUALS LAID OFF BY ARNOTT'S</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Workers' Union says casual workers laid off by Arnott's due to extortion threats against the company should be compensated by the State and Federal Governments.</p>
<p>The union's writing to both levels of Government.</p>
<p>It says compensation would make extortion threats less effective, because it would diminish their potential impact, especially if the company targeted is insured.</p>
<p>Arnott's has been at the centre of extortion demands involving a double murder case for over a month, but detectives say they'll consider it over if they don't hear from the extortionists today.</p>
<p>The demands forced Arnott's to withdraw its biscuits from stores.</p>
