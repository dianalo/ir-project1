<title>USA: Venezuelan Petrozuata partners tap loan arrangers.</title>
<headline>Venezuelan Petrozuata partners tap loan arrangers.</headline>

<p>E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co energy unit Conoco and state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela subsidiary Maraven on Thursday named four international banks to arrange $700 million in senior debt financing for their $2.2 billion Petrozuata oil project, sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The partners tapped Credit Suisse, ING Barings, Nationsbank and Union Bank of Switzerland to jointly arrange the closely watched transaction.</p>
<p>The loan represents the bulk of the $1.3 billion debt portion of the deal, which has a total cost of $2.2 billion, the sources said.</p>
<p>Investors are keeping an eye on the financial fortunes of Petrozuata as a barometer for the success of at least five other proposed Orinoco upgrading deals with top U.S. and European companies.</p>
<p>The four banks, which beat out about 19 other institutions that were invited to bid, offered the project partners 14 years in which to pay back the loan.</p>
<p>The group also offered to forego political risk insurance, the sources said.</p>
<p>The winning bid is considered &quot;very aggressive from a banking perspective,&quot; a source at a separate financial institution said.</p>
<p>The project partners are now awaiting the imminent release of credit ratings for a bond offering to cover at least part of the remaining debt portion of the project.</p>
<p>Sources say Petrozuata is very likely to secure an investment grade rating, equivalent to Triple-B or better, from at least one of the top rating agencies.</p>
<p>Venezuela has a sovereign credit rating of Single-B from Standard &amp; Poor's and Ba2 from Moody's, both below investment grade.</p>
<p>Petrozuata, a 50-50 joint venture, would produce, upgrade and export Venezuelan extra-heavy crude oil from the country's vast Orinoco Tar Belt.</p>
<p>The partners plan to pump about 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) of extra-heavy crude and upgrade it into 104,000 bpd of 21 API gravity &quot;synthetic&quot; crude for export.</p>
<p>The belt, known in Spanish as the Faja, contains an estimated 270 billion barrels of recoverable extra-heavy crude reserves.</p>
