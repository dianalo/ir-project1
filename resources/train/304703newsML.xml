<p>A distant, fading supernova that first attracted earthly attention 10 years ago is starting to brighten again as it moves toward a collision likely to take place in the year 2007, astronomers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The supernova, a giant star that exploded, has been getting dimmer by the year since it first was noticed by astronomers in Chile in February 1987, but now scientists find its brilliance is increasing.</p>
<p>That is likely to continue until the wave of energy sparked by the killer explosion moves outward from the dying star like a circular ripple in a pond, to collide with a massive ring of hydrogen gas that surrounds the supernova.</p>
<p>The gas ring, about one light-year or 6 trillion miles across, probably formed from material expelled from the star some 20,000 years before it blew up, said Richard McCray of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p>&quot;The supernova is digging up its own past,&quot; McCray said at a news conference at a meeting in Toronto of the American Astronomical Society. &quot;It will light up the material that it spewed out long before the explosion occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>This supernova, known as 1987A, is expected to brighten steadily until 2007, when its inner blast wave is likely to collide with the dense outer hydrogen ring. By then, 1987A will be a thousand times brighter than it is now, but still not bright enough to be seen by the naked eye.</p>
<p>In the most recent images made by the orbitting Hubble Space Telescope, the supernova appears to be in the middle layer of a kind of cosmic sandwich, with huge circular rings of gas above and below it, as well as around it.</p>
<p>The dying star itself is seen only as the debris generated by the explosion that turned it into a supernova. This glowing debris is quickly moving outward toward a smaller ring of slowly-expanding gas, McCray and other scientists said.</p>
<p>Predictions of the impending smashup were made by supercomputer modeling, but the actual progress of the distant supernova will be followed on the Hubble telescope, with the help of new equipment to be added during a space shuttle mission in February, the researchers said.</p>
<p>McCray, who said he has thought about this particular supernova daily since it was discovered, said there are only &quot;half-baked&quot; explanations for how the three-ring structure around 1987A evolved. But he said that the increasing brilliance of the supernova should help shed light on this mystery.</p>
