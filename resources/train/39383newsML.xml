<p>SETBACK FOR BHARATIYA JANATA PARTY PRESIDENT</p>
<p>A Delhi court ordered the framing of charges against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President L.K. Advani under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Central Bureau of Investigation has accused Advani of having accepted 3.5 million rupees in the form of a hawala (illegal money transfer) pay-off. The court order came as a severe setback for the BJP president, who had committed himself to staying out of electoral politics till the charges against him were dropped.</p>

<p>FOUR JHARKHAND MUKTI MORCHA LEADERS ARRESTED IN PAY-OFF CASE</p>
<p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested three former and one sitting Members of Parliament (MPs) of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, accused in the multi-million bribery case. CBI sources said the arrests were made following the interrogation of former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao on his alleged involvement in the case. The four accused, while being MPs in 1993, allegedly obtained illegal gratification as a motive for voting in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) against the no-confidence motion moved by the opposition parties. Congress president Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister at that time.</p>

<p>TAX BREAKS TO BUOY CAPITAL MARKET</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced a clutch of tax concessions on investment in mutual funds, including Unit Trust of India (UTI). The move is aimed at boosting the capital markets by encouraging small investors. The minister, while replying to the budget debate, said the norms for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had been further liberalised to permit them to raise their investments in corporate debt instruments from 30 to 100 percent. However, this would be restricted to dedicated debt funds. The minister also promised to make out a case with UTI and Life Insurance Corporation to step up their stock-market activity to ensure that FIIs alone do not emerge as the driving force in the markets.</p>

<p>OPPENHEIMER TO SHUT INDIAN OPERATIONS</p>
<p>Oppenheimer India Ltd, the local arm of the US-based Oppenheimer group, has decided to shut down operations in the country. The organisation has already retrenched staff at the Indian outfit. It would stop operations by the end of the year. However, the offshore India funds, already floated by Oppenheimer's asset management outfit, would remain operational. Sources said the decision was prompted by Oppenheimer's inability to succeed in Indian investment banking operations in the face of intense competition from other global majors.</p>
