<title>GERMANY: INSTANT VIEW - German March M3 money supply.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - German March M3 money supply.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following are comments from economists after the Bundesbank said March M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 8.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 1996. M3 grew at a 9.1 percent pace in February.</p>
<p>ADOLF ROSENSTOCK, Industrial Bank of Japan: &quot;The headline 8.3 percent is just what markets expected. The details are rather confusing. Lending to the private sector slowed down more than expected. and monetary capital formation was also weak. We were right for the wrong reasons&quot;.  </p>
<p>The recovery is still intact (despite) recent data that show there has been some kind of set back. Now we hear that credit in the private sector has slowed down. The recovery will remain, but will be moderate in the first half of the year&quot;.</p>
<p>ROB HAYWARD, Bank of America, London: &quot;In the detail, it fits in with the idea that government revenues targets are undershooting. Some capital is flowing out of the country. We will see monetary growth within the Bundesbank's target (but) the Bundesbank is paying more attention to inflation indicators. For the moment, the Bundesbank is happy to keep rates steady&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will see more demand coming through from the overseas sector. The fall-off in domestic credit shows that the domestic economy is not doing so well. This is consistent with the idea that monetary growth will slacken. The mark has been strengthening on French political worries. Our expectation is that after a period of consolidation, the dollar will strengthen toward 1.80.</p>
<p>WIKE GROENENBERG, Salomon Brothers: If you look at the credit figures, they have been picking up for some time. You see there is an increased momentum in the economy. The mark strength has not filtered through into the economy -- it normally takes some time for a big change in the currency (to be felt in the economy). Mark-dollar is range-bound at current levels and there is more talk of Fed interest rate hikes. Any futher dollar weakness will be capped and we will see mark dollar rate near 1.70.</p>
