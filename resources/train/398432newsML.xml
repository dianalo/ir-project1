<p>Rabobank International said it was possible the Dutch central bank will hike its special-advances rate by 10 to 20 basis points on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said the central bank would have to narrow the spread between its special-advances rate and Germany's repo rate due to fading expectations of a German interest rate cut and the mark's rise above 1.1235 guilders in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The special-advances rate has been held at 2.50 percent since August. The repo rate currently stands at 3.00 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, with both conditions currently fulfilled, we seriously reckon with the possibility of a unilateral rate hike this week,&quot; Rabobank said in its Financial Weekly report.</p>
<p>Rabobank fixed-income analyst Niels Kortleve told Reuters he expected a rise of 10-20 basis points in the advances rate.</p>
<p>The special-advances and repo rates set the tone for money market rates in each country.</p>
<p>Rabobank said the chances of a monetary tightening in the Netherlands this week would fall significantly only if the mark fell below 1.1235 guilders, the former upper boundary of its trading range, from around 1.1240 guilders at 1435 GMT.</p>
<p>Rabobank also said it expected Dutch 2000 and 2001 bonds to outperform similar German paper because it believed the Dutch yield curve was too steep in those maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;Most Dutch bonds in this area have relatively high coupons and, as a consequence, low durations, which makes these bonds even more attractive when we compare them with (German) BOBLs on a duration basis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bank said the Dutch yield curve was steeper than the German curve in these maturities because of expectations of a Dutch rate hike, but the actual difference was not justified.</p>
