<title>FRANCE: Corsican separatist faction renounces violence.</title>
<headline>Corsican separatist faction renounces violence.</headline>

<text>
<p>A faction of the separatist Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) renounced guerrilla violence on Thursday, pledging to resort to political campaigns to press its goal.</p>
<p>A hundred or so hooded men wearing military gear but carrying no weapons staged a nocturnal FLNC &quot;Normal Wing&quot; news conference outside the city of Ajaccio in the south of the French Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>&quot;The Corsican people no longer want political violence. The clandestine struggle must be abandoned. Nationalism must hereafter express itself on the ground through political and social action, where it proves useful,&quot; one man explained.</p>
<p>Formed in October 1990 after the FLNC broke up, the &quot;Normal Wing&quot; has resorted little to violence, unlike the rival &quot;Historic Wing&quot; faction.</p>
<p>Already in November 1994, 300 militants had announced at two simultaneous news conferences in southern and northern Corsica that they wanted a political settlement and that they renounced violence save in cases &quot;where the interests of the Corsican people are in danger&quot;.</p>
<p>The faction has not claimed responsibility for any attacks for the past two and a half years.</p>
<p>The &quot;Historic Wing&quot;, however, has continued its campaign of bombings on chiefly public offices.</p>
<p>It claimed responsibility for a powerful bomb which ripped through the offices of the national carrier Air France in the French Riveria capital Nice on Tuesday. The blast caused extensive damage but no casualties.</p>
<p>In a statement to media in Corsica, the separatists said they carried out the Air France attack and a dozen other blasts in December and January against public offices, bank agencies and a gendarmerie vehicle on the island.</p>
<p>Police said a bomb heavily damaged a post office in Nice harbour early on Thursday but caused no casualties. Investigators said the explosives were apparently similar to those used in the Air France bombing two days previously.</p>
