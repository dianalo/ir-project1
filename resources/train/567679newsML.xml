<p>British Petroleum Co Plc on Tuesday said it expected to substantially raise its interest in Gulf of Mexico oil production in the next eight years.</p>
<p>The oil giant aims to boost its share in the region's oil production ventures to 300,000 barrels per day by 2005 from a current level of 80,000, said BP chief executive John Browne.</p>
<p>He was speaking after BP had released its first quarter results, which showed that Gulf of Mexico production had doubled compared with a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll double again fairly quickly,&quot; said Browne. &quot;We'll continue to pick up new deep water licences and go for them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>BP is less successful in the West of Shetland area in the Atlantic Ocean where the company continues to fail to meet deadlines to get the Foinaven field onstream.</p>
<p>BP would not specify the extra costs of the Foinaven delays, merely saying that the setbacks should be viewed against favourable production results elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>BP earlier said production at Foinaven was delayed again due to bad weather, after the field was originally scheduled to come onstream nearly a year ago.</p>
<p>Browne meanwhile pre-empted any further criticism from environmental lobby groups, by saying that BP would &quot;not leave a stone untouched&quot; to ensure safe production at the largely unexplored Atlantic waters north-west of Scotland.</p>
