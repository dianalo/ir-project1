<title>USA: CME to open new cheese market, replacing Green Bay.</title>
<headline>CME to open new cheese market, replacing Green Bay.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will create a new cash market for cheese that would replace trading on the National Cheese Exchange (NCE) in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the exchanges said.</p>
<p>CME said in a statement that NCE's board and the executive committee of the National Cheese Institute (NCI) had accepted a CME proposal to create a new cheese market. It added that the market would open on May 2 but that specifics had yet to be determined by the respective parties.</p>
<p>NCE said a separate statement that the NCE trading in Green Bay would be shut when the new CME market opens.  </p>
<p>&quot;The establishment of this new cash market for cheese, offering improved opportunities for expanded trading, means there will no longer be a need for trading at the National Cheese Exchange,&quot; the NCE said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore the NCE in Green Bay will cease trading upon the opening of the new CME cash market,&quot; it stated.</p>
<p>&quot;As the current levels of governement involvement diminish, the CME stands poised to offer the dairy industry proven risk management tools and a price discovery system,&quot; Robert Prodi, a CME board member and chairman of the CME's Dairy Products Committee, said in the CME statement.  </p>
<p>NCE noted that trading rules and specifications on the new market would be similiar to those of the NCE, &quot;thereby encouraging rapid transfer of trading activities from one exchange to the other.&quot;</p>
<p>But trading would be handled through professional brokers, providing for anonymity of trading participants, it said, adding that Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson's task force on cheese pricing had recommended anonymous trading, a common convention in almost all commodities.  </p>
<p>NCE said cash markets were generally not subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jurisdiction.</p>
<p>But since CME had sophisticated internal surveillance and enforcement measures to cope with CFTC regulations, the new cheese market would be subject to, and benefit from, the same standard of scrutiny as other CME contracts, it said.</p>
<p>NCE said the industry chose CME over the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange in New York because of the Merc's proximity to the center of cheese production -- the Midwest and West -- and CME's long history of trading perishable agricultural commodities, as well as the surveilance and oversight systems.  </p>
<p>CME started business as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board.</p>
<p>NCE said it did not necessarily expect CME cheese trading to affect activity in existing dairy futures on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange and added that it also expected CME to launch new dairy futures in the next six to 12 months.</p>
