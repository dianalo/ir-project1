<title>INDONESIA: Bre-X, Freeport sign Busang MOU.</title>
<headline>Bre-X, Freeport sign Busang MOU.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-02-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Canadian mining firm Bre-X Minerals Ltd, Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc of the U.S. and Indonesian interests have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the development of the huge Busang gold find, industry sources said on Monday.  </p>
<p>They said Bre-X, which discovered the find in Indonesia's East Kalimantan province, was expected to make an announcement in Canada later on Monday. Bre-X estimates the find contains at least 57 million ounces of gold.</p>
<p>The sources said the Memorandum of Undestanding was signed on Sunday by Bre-X, Freeport and Indonesian timber tycoon Muhammad &quot;Bob&quot; Hasan on behalf of the Indonesian interests.</p>
<p>The sources said that under the deal, Bre-X would get a 45 percent stake in Busang, Indonesian interests would get 40 percent, and Freeport 15 percent through a new joint-venture company.  </p>
<p>Freeport, which has an 81.28 percent share of PT Freeport Indonesia, which operates one of the world's biggest copper and gold mines in Irian Jaya, would develop and operate the Busang mine in remote rain forest and rolling hills on Borneo island.</p>
<p>The Nusamba group, 80 percent owned by three foundations headed by President Suharto, and 10 percent each by Hasan and Suharto's eldest son Sigit Harjojudanto, has taken a 50 percent share in two minority stakeholders in the richest part of the Busang find.  </p>
<p>Nusamba also recently bought just over 50 percent of PT Indocopper Investama Corp, which in turn holds a 9.3 percent stake in Freeport Indonesia for $311.8 million.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how the Indonesian interests would be split up, but sources said the 40 percent included the two minority stakeholders. Indonesian state mining firms have also expressed interest in participating.</p>
<p>The sources said that Freeport McMoRan had only become involved in negotiations for the development of Busang in the middle of last week.  </p>
<p>They said among the things that tipped the scales in favour of Freeport was its equity participation and a loan of $1.2 billion secured from Chase Manhattan Corp in New York to finance development.</p>
<p>Chase was expected to syndicate the loan.</p>
<p>A Freeport spokesman told Reuters he had &quot;no information that can be shared at this time&quot;.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government had given Bre-X and another potential partner Barrick Gold Corp until Monday to settle with their local partners and reach an agreement on how to develop Busang or possibly lose control of the find.  </p>
<p>Bre-X chief executive David Walsh said in Canada that as of Friday no agreements had been signed.</p>
<p>Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana and ministry secretary-general Umar Said were both out of Jakarta, although they were expected to return on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>An official at the Mines and Energy Ministry close to the negotiations said he had not yet received any report on the talks involving Bre-X and Barrick.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not got the result of their negotiations. I don't know whether the minister or the secretary general has got a report or not,&quot; the official, who declined to be named, said.  </p>
<p>Industry sources said it was not immediately clear where this left Barrick.</p>
<p>The government in November urged Bre-X to take Barrick as a partner. The Mines and Energy Ministry said in December Bre-X and Barrick, now the world's number two gold miner, had agreed to split the find 22.5 percent to Bre-X, 67.5 percent to Barrick and 10 percent to the government.</p>
<p>However, Bre-X has never hidden the fact that it was unhappy with the Barrick relationship.</p>
