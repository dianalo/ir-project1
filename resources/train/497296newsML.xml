<p>French stocks closed sharply higher on Wednesday in a rally triggered by three days of gains on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 38.55 points, or 1.49 percent, at 2,617.55.</p>
<p>The index finished off its session highs after Wall Street snapped its rising streak in early trading, but brokers said the bourse was sustained by expectations that the franc's strength left scope for a French interest rate cut.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 April futures contract rose 38 points to 2,820.</p>
<p>Volume was 6.77 billion francs.  </p>
<p>* Cosmetics group L'Oreal rose 4.23 percent to 1,995 francs after brokerage Cheuvreux de Virieu raised its rating to buy and included L'Oreal's 57-percent owned Synthelabo pharmaceuticals subsidiary in its list of recommended shares. Synthelabo rose 2.12 percent to 626 francs.</p>
<p>* Renault shares rose 3.24 percent to 146.50 francs. Traders said that although Renault and Volvo denied a report that Renault would sell Volvo its Mack Trucks unit, the talk spurred speculation that Renault may be preparing a restructuring of its ailing truck operations. It recently announced job cuts and a plant closure in its car operations.  </p>
<p>* Cie Generale des Eaux unit SGE extended Tuesday's four percent gain, adding 5.81 percent to 133 francs. Brokerage Dupont Denant raised its rating on the stock and earnings estimates on Tuesday after an analysts' meeting.</p>
<p>* CCMX rose 13.76 percent to 62 francs on the first day of a 62 franc per share buyout by Clio, held by the state entity Consortium de Realisation which groups Credit Lyonnais assets to be sold.</p>
<p>* Canal Plus closed up 3.73 percent to 1,085 francs, buoyed by the increase in its weighting in the CAC index to 1.5 percent from 0.2 percent.  </p>
<p>Havas and Richemont hold a combined 49 percent of Canal Plus, markets authority CMF said. Their holdings rose as part of the Canal Plus-Nethold merger due to be completed this month.</p>
<p>* Alcatel Alsthom rose three percent to 687 francs. One trader said J.P. Morgan issued a note with an 800 franc objective on the share.</p>
<p>* Shares in retailer Castorama finished up 5.87 percent at 920 francs on rumours it was about to conclude an acquisition in Italy, traders said.</p>
