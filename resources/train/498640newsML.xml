<p>New Zealand inflation data due on Tuesday are expected to offer crucial insights into whether markets are justified in keeping monetary conditions tighter than the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) wants.</p>
<p>Analysts say the market seems to hold a less rosy view than the central bank of inflation prospects as the economy starts to drag itself out of a shallow downturn.</p>
<p>This pessimism has doggedly held the currency and short term interest rates high even though the RBNZ has called monetary conditions &quot;inappropriately firm&quot;.</p>
<p>Analysts hope the March quarter Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will offer clues on whose view of inflation is right.</p>
<p>ANZ Bank economists said quarterly underlying inflation in line with its own expectation of 0.4 percent might prompt markets to ease conditions by bringing the currency and/or interest rates down.</p>
<p>&quot;(It) may provide much needed reassurance to the financial markets that New Zealand is indeed on track to achieve lower inflation over the year ahead,&quot; ANZ wrote in a commentary.</p>
<p>The RBNZ is mandated to keep underlying inflation within a 0 to 3.0 percent target band. Core inflation in the year to December was a surprisingly strong 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>Last month the RBNZ predicted core inflation at 0.5 percent in the March quarter and 2.2 percent in the year, falling to a low of 0.8 percent in the years to June and September 1998.</p>
<p>On average, 10 economists surveyed by Reuters said they expect 0.4 percent March quarter inflation (2.15 percent annually).</p>
<p>AMP economist Peter Scobie said even though the market expected slightly lower March quarter inflation than the RBNZ, it remained more pessimistic about longer term inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take the bank's growth outlook, there is going to be very little capacity available in the economy, and potentially you could get some inflation pressures in that type of environment,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It would take a significant (economic) slowdown from here to free up a lot of capacity, and it just doesn't appear obvious that's going to happen.&quot;</p>
<p>SBC Warburg economist Robin Clements disagreed with the ANZ's view that 0.4 percent quarterly inflation would be sufficiently low to prompt markets to ease conditions.</p>
<p>He said a 0.4 or 0.5 percent quarterly out-turn would reinforce the market's view that the inflation outlook was not as good as the RBNZ thought, and reaction would be limited.</p>
<p>It would take inflation at 0.3 percent to persuade traders the RBNZ was right. &quot;That's when rates and the currency might get a bit more of a kick (lower),&quot; Clements said.</p>
<p>There was some disagreement among economists over whether economic activity had troughed and what the implications were for inflation. The National Bank said economic activity was past its trough, and lower interest rates, higher government spending and rising world growth would all boost activity over 1997.</p>
<p>WestpacTrust chief economist Bevan Graham said further out, all the inflation risks were on the upside.</p>
<p>&quot;If economic growth has indeed 'bottomed' at current levels of around 2.5 percent then we cannot see how the expected expansion in activity throughout this year and into 1998 can be accommodated without higher inflation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Wellington bank bill dealer said a substantial move lower in interest rates on the back of Tuesday's data would be &quot;hard to come by&quot;, as traders would soon start to worry the U.S. Federal Reserve might lift interest rates again in May.</p>
