<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>German Bunds and futures were firmer in early trade on Monday, supported by U.S. debt market gains on Friday and European Union finance ministers saying again that European monetary union will start on time in 1999.</p>
<p>DTB September Bund futures were up 17 basis points at 101.01 points, while the 10-year cash benchmark Bund due July 2007 at 101.75 with a yield of 5.76 percent.</p>
<p>The German market was catching up in early trade to gains in the U.S. market late on Friday despite the robust U.S. jobs data and unemployment falling to a 23-month low in May.  </p>
<p>Traders looked for September futures to trade within a range from 100.90 to 101.15 in a consolidative tone as the market waits for further developments at the EU finance minister meeting in Luxembourg and the debate about EMU.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said earlier on Monday that he stood by his interpretation of the Maastricht Treaty's deficit criteria as being 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also said on Sunday he stood by Waigel and that EMU would start on time on January 1, 1999, and said talk of a delay in currency union was unproductive and that a delay in the project could be a fatal blow.  </p>
<p>The market also found some support after France's finance minister on Sunday reassured his European colleagues that the new Paris government remained committed to EMU.</p>
<p>On a technical basis, traders said September futures may seek to test support at 100.90 and 100.76 before the market can move towards 101.55 points, the high from May.</p>
<p>Resistance for the contract was evident at 101.08 and 101.30 points.</p>
