<p>The Bulgarian National Bank on Friday corrected its new main annual interest rate to 9.76 percent from the 9.56 percent it announced on Thursday, a BNB spokesman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was a technical error in the interest rate cut announcement yesterday. The correct simple main annual interest rate is 9.76 percent, from 10.12 percent now,&quot; BNB spokesman Kostadin Georgiev told Reuters. The new rate is effective from July 7.</p>
<p>A BNB statement on Thursday said the bank had set the main simple annual rate at 9.56 percent as of July 7.</p>
<p>The rate is calculated on the average yield to maturity on three-month discount T-bills, which was 2.46 percent for bills auctioned on Monday.</p>
<p>A week ago the BNB set the simple main rate at 10.12 percent, shadowing excessive lev liqidity on the domestic money market.</p>
<p>Interest rates have come down to 0.81 percent monthly from 18 percent in March, reflecting a stabilising trend in the economy after an IMF reform and funding deal reached in March. On Tuesday Bulgaria launched a restrictive fixed exchange rate regime aimed at restoring confidence in the financial system.</p>
