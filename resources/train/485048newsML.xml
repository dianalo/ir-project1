<title>CANADA: Maritimes &amp; Northeast signs natgas supply deal.</title>
<headline>Maritimes &amp; Northeast signs natgas supply deal.</headline>
<dateline>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline said on Thursday it signed two deals to supply Sable Island natural gas to operations owned by Canada's private Irving Cos, should its line be built.</p>
<p>Maritimes &amp; Northeast, whose Canadian portion is operated by Westcoast Energy Inc, said the precedent agreements were for the delivery of gas to the Irving Oil refinery, Irving Paper and Irving Pulp and Paper.</p>
<p>The Irving Cos agreed to receive up to 45,000 million British thermal units of gas per day at the refinery and mills in Saint John, New Brunswick starting in November 1999.  </p>
<p>Another 40,000 mmBtu per day would be shipped to Irving Paper and the refinery for power cogeneration, Maritimes &amp; Northeast said.</p>
<p>The deal follows earlier precedent agreements signed with New Brunswick Power, a government-owned utility, and Nova Scotia Power.</p>
<p>Westcoast's partners in the proposed pipeline, which is vying to ship gas from the Sable Island fields to be developed offshore Nova Scotia, include Mobil Corp unit Mobil Oil Canada and PanEnergy Corp.  </p>
<p>Maritmes &amp; Northeast is competing with a proposal to ship Sable gas put forward by Trans Quebec &amp; Maritimes Pipeline, which is co-owned by TransCanada PipeLines Ltd and Gaz Metropolitain and Co Lp.</p>
<p>It said the precedent agreements were binding commitments obligating both parties to put in place the necessary facilities and to seek approval for transport service by November 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;These agreements represent further significant support for the Maritimes &amp; Northeast pipeline,&quot; Maritimes &amp; Northeast president Pat Langan said in a statement.</p>
<p>The proposed 1,038 km pipeline would serve Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and New England before interconnecting with the North American pipeline grid near Dracut, Mass.</p>
<p>The competing line would also move the gas to the U.S. Northeast, but via Quebec.</p>
