<p>A former Belgian army colonel has been charged with corruption as part of an investigation of allegations that French aerospace group Dassault paid bribes to Belgian political parties, a court official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Ex-colonel Willy Dewint has been charged with corruption. He has not been arrested,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Belgian media said Dewint headed a company which lobbied for Dassault, but the official declined to confirm or deny this.</p>
<p>Last week, Merry Hermanus and Francois Pirot, two former top officials of Belgium's francophone Socialist Party (PS), were arrested and charged with corruption in the Dassault probe.</p>
<p>The arrests have led to a leadership crisis in the PS and to opposition calls for new elections.</p>
<p>The Belgian judiciary is investigating claims that Dassault paid kickbacks to Belgian parties to secure a 1989 contract to fit air defence systems to the country's F-16 fighter jets. Dassault has repeatedly denied this.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the two PS officials have said that Hermanus and Pirot accepted 30 million francs (about $1 million) from Dassault for the PS.</p>
<p>In December, the Dutch-speaking Christian Democratic Party CVP admitted it had been given 1.2 million francs by Dassault in 1987. The Flemish Socialist Party (SP) is also under investigation.</p>
<p>The PS, SP, CVP and the francophone Christian Democratic party PSC make up Belgium's centre-left coalition.</p>
<p>Last May, the Belgian judiciary issued an international arrest warrant for Serge Dassault, group founder and chairman of Dassault Aviation, who has denied all wrongdoing but has refused to come to Belgium to answer questions relating to the affair.</p>
<p>Dassault was questioned by a French court, in the presence of Belgian investigators, in Paris in November 1995.</p>
