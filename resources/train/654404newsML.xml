<title>USA: Paula Jones lawyer fails in Virginia political bid.</title>
<headline>Paula Jones lawyer fails in Virginia political bid.</headline>
<dateline>RICHMOND, Va 1997-06-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gilbert Davis, one of the lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman suing President Clinton for sexual harassment, failed Tuesday in his bid to win the Republican nomination to become Virginia's attorney general.</p>
<p>With over 90 percent of the votes counted in the state's Republican primary, Davis was running fourth of the four contenders with 18 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>He is one of two attorneys representing former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones, who has accused Clinton of making unwanted sexual advances towards her when he was governor of Arkansas.</p>
<p>Last month Davis won a 9-0 victory in the Supreme Court, gaining the right to have the case go forward while Clinton is in the White House. Some political observers in Virginia speculated that the national exposure he won from the Jones case would help him in the primary.</p>
<p>But with only 6 percent of the electorate turning out to vote, victory went to state senator Mark Earley, who had targeted social and religious conservatives for support. Earley won 36 percent of the vote, ahead of Jerry Kilgore with 25 percent and Kenneth Stolle with 21 percent.</p>
<p>Stolle ran a television advertisement last week showing Davis in an amateur video, apparently under the influence of alcohol, making suggestive comments to a female client.</p>
