<p>The World Bank's private sector financing arm unveiled plans on Tuesday to fund three new projects in Vietnam, open an office in Hanoi and step up efforts to help non-state business flourish.</p>
<p>&quot;It is...clear to me that Vietnam remains on a path of significant growth,&quot; Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice-president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said at a signing ceremony in Hanoi.</p>
<p>&quot;I also believe that presents significant prospects for the non-state sector. The IFC remains deeply committed to helping the country move forward,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank, is the largest multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private sector projects in developing countries.</p>
<p>Lindbaek said the IFC had now backed 15 projects in communist Vietnam worth $830 million with $156 million of its own funds.</p>
<p>He said it was now considering another $500 million worth of projects in sectors including cement production, flour milling, pharmaceuticals and ports.</p>
<p>Vietnam embarked on market-style reforms in the late 1980s to end years of disastrous Soviet-style economic planning. The economy has blossomed since then, growing at an average rate of 8.2 percent a year since 1991.</p>
<p>However, state-owned firms and cooperatives still account for 40 percent of national output, and the Communist Party has said it is determined to bolster the state sector's leading role in the economy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said in an interview last week that policy would not preclude a level playing field approach towards public and private businesses.</p>
<p>The World Bank, which has offered Hanoi $1.5 billion in soft loans over the next three years, has been among the most vocal in urging the country to promote the private sector.</p>
<p>Lindbaek said the IFC would launch a five-year, $25 million project to assist in promoting small- and medium-sized businesses in Vietnam and its neighbours, Laos and Cambodia.</p>
<p>The IFC will manage and contribute $4 million to the Mekong Project Development Facility's budget. Donors, including Australia, Norway, Sweden and Australia, will provide the rest.</p>
<p>Lindbaek said the IFC would also make its debut in Vietnam's nascent financial sector, investing $15.75 million to help the country establish its first leasing company.</p>
<p>&quot;IFC's investment...will play a pioneering role in the establishment of the leasing industry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will also support small and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of Vietnam's non-state sector and the main engine for economic growth.&quot;</p>
<p>The corporation's third project was an agreement to provide $14.5 million in loans to a glass bottle joint venture in northern Vietnam that is majority-owned by the Philippines-based food and drink firm San Miguel Corporation.</p>
