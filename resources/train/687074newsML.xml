<p>Britain on Wednesday announced a review of ways of increasing bus use as part of an integrated transport policy aimed at easing road congestion and pollution.</p>
<p>Transport minister Gavin Strang said the review would look at all aspects of buses, including:</p>
<p>-- the scope for more effective use of bus priority measures, coupled as necessary with traffic restraint</p>
<p>-- better arrangements for passenger information and ticketing, including inter-modal travel.</p>
<p>--  regulatory and other measures to improve the quality of bus services, including partnerships between operators and local authorities.</p>
<p>The review will also address financial issues such as costs and support for the industry, Strang said.</p>
<p>&quot;Its purpose is to examine how buses can best play their part in an integrated transport policy. Our aim is to see increased use of the bus as a means of reducing congestion and pollution, particularly by attracting motorists from their cars,&quot; Strang said.</p>
<p>He said he would consult fully with the bus industry, local authorities, bus users and other interest groups in preparation for a white policy paper next Spring on an integrated transport policy.</p>
<p>Strang said there had been positive developments in recent years, but more had to be done if buses were to play a greater role in meeting transport needs and reducing car dependence.</p>
<p>The aim, he said, must be to develop ways of making bus services more efficient, reliable, frequent, clean and safe.</p>
<p>&quot;This may mean asking how best practice can be encouraged and adopted more widely. It may mean looking again at enforcement strategies, so that investment in bus priority measures yields the payback that it should.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to involve improvements to public transport to encourage people to make less use of their cars.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Strang said that options for regulating the bus industry would be considered against these objectives and the extent to which they would improveme key areas such as passenger information and ticketing, service frequency and reliability, and greater stability in the market.</p>
