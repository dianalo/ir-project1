<p>Albanians who lost their life savings when pyramid investment schemes collapsed planned fresh protests on Sunday after President Sali Berisha admitted the government made mistakes in handling the crisis.</p>
<p>The main opposition alliance, the Forum for Democracy, urged people to attend a mass rally in Tirana although it did not have an official permit for the demonstration.</p>
<p>Berisha, in his first real explanation for the scandal, blamed the government, the opposition parties and &quot;those who chose&quot; to all their money into high-risk schemes -- and lost everything.</p>
<p>Thousands of people attended rallies across Albania on Saturday to demand reimbursement and call for the right-wing government of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi to resign.</p>
<p>But Berisha sternly told the public, who emerged from 45 years of isolation and Stalinism only in 1990, that they had learned a hard lesson in free market economics and would get no cash from the government.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not take this debt on our shoulders. No democratic government would do this. It would be cheating, printing money to pay and creating hyperinflation&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>The Forum for Democracy's call for a mass rally in Tirana came after riot police blocked earlier demonstrations in the capital, confining anti-government protests largely to the provinces.</p>
<p>Protesters marched peacefully in the southern towns of Vlore, Fier, Tepelene and Permet on Saturday, chanting: &quot;Down with government, president and parliament&quot; and &quot;We want our money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We would not stop until the government resigns and the ruined and robbed people are free,&quot; said Halit Gjoni, an opposition socialist deputy.</p>
<p>In Fier, police stepped aside and let thousands of angry investors march. In Vlore, the scene of bloody clashes last Monday, people demonstrated for a 12th day.</p>
<p>A senior police commander, who declined to be named, said: &quot;There is no problem. We have withdrawn the riot police. Let them demonstrate. It's their right.&quot;</p>
<p>Vlore has seen some of the most serious violence since the popular high-risk investment schemes began collapsing in January.</p>
<p>Berisha acknowledged that many Albanians were now homeless because they sold their houses to pump money into schemes which promised to pay interest of 60 percent or more a month.</p>
<p>Bankers estimate that $1 to $2 billion may have been poured into dodgy schemes, five of which have gone bust in the past month.</p>
<p>Anti-government protests and riots have swept Albania, Europe's poorest country, since the schemes began to fail in January. Several people have been killed and hundreds have been injured or arrested.</p>
<p>Berisha pleaded that the government had been naive and was new to democracy and capitalism. He appealed to all parties to join in trying to sort out the mess.</p>
<p>But, in a thinly-veiled reference, he blasted the main opposition Socialist Party, the former communists, for trying to exploit the confusion for political advantage.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, at a time when hundreds of thousands of Albanians are suffering from losses in pyramid schemes, a minority...wants to turn this big, but not irreparable, loss into a real national tragedy,&quot; he said.</p>
