<headline>Mexico Cetes rate shrugs FOMC hike to end down.</headline>

<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates fended off an expected increase in U.S. interest rates to close down 60 basis points at 21.40 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The FOMC hike was already discounted. The market it took it well, as the peso reacted well,&quot; a trader said, adding that Mexican interest rates were still expensive despite higher U.S. rates.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee announced in late trade it had decided to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The peso firmed up very well on Monday and was strong today. I think we may see firm rates,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts ended 0.3 of a centavo softer at 7.8930/7.8950 per dollar, which traders said was due to pre-weekend swap deals rather than the decision to raise U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on Cetes reached a high of 21.75 percent during the session, but were mostly stable.</p>
<p>&quot;There was little dealing. Many bought term paper last week and others just waited for the FOMC decision,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said turnover was light due to forthcoming Easter holidays, which will be celebrated on March 27 and 28.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile closed down 25 basis points at 22.75 percent.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico drained 1.966 billion pesos from the market through four auctions which it assigned at rates of between 22.70 and 22.91 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 4.920 billion pesos was scheduled to return to the system on Wednesday from prior central bank participation.</p>
