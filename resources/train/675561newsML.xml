<p>The U.N. development agency ignored or played down abuses by the Kenyan government against many of the 300,000 people displaced by ethnic violence before the 1992 elections, a human rights group said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The London-based Human Rights Watch/Africa said in a report issued in Nairobi that UNDP's conduct meant that programmes for the displaced would fail to find lasting solutions to help people regain their homes and livelihoods.</p>
<p>The group said the New York-based agency was reluctant to recognise that human rights and protection were essential to the success of emergency programmes around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;During the programme, government was blatantly responsible for continued threats or actual violence against the displaced, forced dispersals, destruction of camp sites by police and the harassment of those assisting the displaced,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Government-instigated violence against ethnic groups that supported the political opposition caused the displacement, and UNDP faced predictable constraints in its operations because of government actions hostile to genuine assistance and protection efforts,&quot; said the report, titled &quot;Failing the Internally Displaced: the UNDP Displaced Persons Programme in Kenya&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the UNDP in Kenya was unwilling and unprepared to deal with predictable resistance from the government, resulting in the agency focusing on relief assistance, which the human rights body saw as the easiest part of the project to run.</p>
<p>The UNDP programme ran between 1993 and 1995.</p>
<p>UNDP has said in previous reports that at least 250,000 people were displaced and 1,000 killed in the violence that erupted in President Daniel arap Moi's native Rift Valey province in the runup to the multi-party polls.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch put the number of displaced at 300,000 and deaths at 1,500, saying 75 percent of these were children.</p>
<p>Most of the clashes pitted members of Moi's Kalenjin tribe and the Masai against the larger Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya tribes.</p>
<p>Generally, Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya settler farms were attacked by organised groups of Kalenjin and Masai &quot;warriors&quot; armed with traditional weapons such as bows and arrows.</p>
<p>The government has persistently said it did not instigate the violence and was doing everything to settle the displaced.</p>
<p>The rights group said that fraudulent land transfers, illegal occupation and land sales made under pressure continued to disempower the internally displaced and contributed to the removal of certain ethnic groups from the Rift Valley region.</p>
<p>&quot;To date, the Kenyan government has condoned the illegal occupation of land by its political supporters and the continued displacement of thousands of its citizens from ethnic groups that are perceived to support the political opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;A significant number of people are still not back on their land today, and will probably never be,&quot; the report added.</p>
<p>A UNDP official in Nairobi said the report contained &quot;a number of serious flaws in terms of facts and details&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We also believe that the report seriously underestimates the positive aspects of the programme and relies excessively on negative reports. It has not taken into account opposing views for a fully balanced opinion,&quot; the official, who declined to be quoted by name, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The rights group said UNDP made progress in alleviating the food emergency but did nothing to heal a climate of mistrust.</p>
<p>UNDP Administrator James Gustave Speth said in a letter annexed to the report: &quot;UNDP, other agencies...were working in a politically difficult and emotionally charged environment. All did their best to navigate through the many obstacles to return the internally displaced persons to their land and homes.&quot;</p>
