<headline>Lithuanian shares gain, Snaige active.</headline>

<p>Lithuanian shares gained slightly on Monday and fridge maker Snaige was active, dealers said.</p>
<p>The index of the official trading list gained 23.59 points, moving up to 922.49 points.</p>
<p>The group A index advanced to 2152.62, a gain of 7.87 points, and central market turnover reached 630,000 litas. Block trades raeched one million litas.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the turn around is already starting because the prices are so low,&quot; said one broker. &quot;The general trend is up.&quot;</p>
<p>Snaige turned over 263,000 litas in block trades on Monday, in what appeared to be heavy interest from an Estonian Bank.</p>
<p>The block trades amounted to 1.7 percent of Snaige's share capital.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that Hansapank bought 5 percent of the company last week, but I don't know who bought 1.7 percent today,&quot; said Snaige President Antanas Andrulionis.</p>
<p>One broker said he was certain today's transaction involved an Estonian bank, but he declined to mention which.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it's an Estonian bank,&quot; said Tomas Andrejauskas, a broker with Suprema.</p>
<p>Snaige shares soared 29.4 percent last week -- jumping 10 percent on Saturday alone after a large block trade the day before. Saturday was a working day in Lithuania.</p>
<p>Snaige's turnover in block trades last week amounted to 1.2 million litas.</p>
<p>Snaige shares gained 4.55 percent on the central market Monday, moving up to 11.50 litas from 11.00 litas.</p>
<p>Rokishkis Cheese shares also continued to advance, moving up to 43.50 litas from 40.00 litas, on central market turnover of 118,000 litas.</p>
<p>&quot;If the price goes below 45.00 litas a share, it becomes attractive,&quot; Andrejauskas said about Rokishkis.</p>
