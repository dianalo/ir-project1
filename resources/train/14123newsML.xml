<headline>Airline stock gives Mauritius bourse slight boost.</headline>

<p>Gains by national carrier Air Mauritius shares pushed the bourse index to a small gain of 0.49 points to 322.12 on Monday, Mauritius bourse officials said.</p>
<p>The carrier bears a big weight in the index, bourse officials said.</p>
<p>Air Mauritius gained 50 cents to 52.50 rupees on 310 shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The small volume does not mean much but it succeeded in lifting the index by its sheer weighting. The rising shares reflect rather low liquidity,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Bourse transactions totalled 2.84 million rupees on 256,036 shares from 4.50 million rupees on 144,997 shares last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is dull both in terms of price levels and volume. It's still the same wait and see attitude among investors,&quot; one financial analyst said.</p>
<p>The analyst added that investors' present retrenched attitude reflected their continued concern about the nomination of a new finance minister after the resignation three weeks ago of Rundheersing Bheenick.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, who took over the finance minister post, announced an imminent cabinet reshuffle and economic analysts say the sooner the reshuffle was made, the better it was for the country.</p>
<p>&quot;When we (local population) are made to understand a government cabinet reshuffle is essential, it is carried out immediately. The country can certainly save itself from a period of uncertainty...,&quot; wrote Gilbert Ahnee in a Mauritian newspaper.</p>
<p>Most prices in the rest of the market remained stable and leading stock Mauritius Commercial Bank roughly accounted for half of Monday's volume.</p>
<p>MCB was stable at 73 rupees on 18,485 shares and State Bank of Mauritius was unchanged at 8.40 rupees on 6,200 shares.</p>
<p>Mauritius Development Investment Trust lost 30 cents to 7.30 rupees on 43,263 shares.</p>
<p>Sugar-based Mon Tresor Mon Desert gained 10 cents to 31.60 rupees on 360 shares while commerce-based Courts (Mauritius) remained at 3.60 rupees on 152,000 shares.</p>
<p>New Mauritius Hotels rose 10 cents to 28 rupees on 1,767 shares.</p>
