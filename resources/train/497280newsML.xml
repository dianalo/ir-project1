<p>European Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler has asked member states what they are doing to improve food safety following the mad cow disease health scare, a European Commission spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fischler, smarting after being stripped of some of his food safety powers and anxious to show a critical European Parliament that public health protection is a priority, also asked in a letter if they were implementing new meat and bone meal processing rules.</p>
<p>&quot;Many member states are unable to meet the conditions. It would be surprising if any country is 100 percent in the clear,&quot; Commission agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely said.</p>
<p>Last month a report by EU veterinary inspectors exposed widespread deficiencies in tackling the fatal cattle brain wasting disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>Member states will be expected to respond this month and those that fail to implement the new meat and bone meal rendering standards that entered into force on April 1 could end up in court, Kiely said.</p>
<p>The new rules involve processing at higher temperatures and for longer periods to eradicate all possible BSE infection.</p>
<p>Infected meat and bone meal mixed into cattle and sheep feed is believed to be the main cause of the spread of BSE.</p>
<p>In February the European Parliament, which has attacked the Commission for putting beef producers' interests before public health, gave the EU's executive until November to improve its track record or face possible dismissal.</p>
<p>Emma Bonino, the EU's energetic and combative consumer affairs commissioner, was given the task of improving food safety and ensuring that anti-BSE measures were properly enforced.</p>
<p>The appointment was part of a strategy to separate responsibility for drafting and implementing food safety rules, previously held by Farm Commissioner Fischler.</p>
<p>However Fischler, who hails from an Austrian alpine village, has always prided himself on championing the interests of small farmers and environmentally friendly production methods.</p>
<p>As part of the campaign to strengthen his food safety credentials, he plans shortly to introduce proposals for the compulsory labelling of all genetically modified animal feed.</p>
<p>BSE, which wrecked the beef market and is expected to cost the EU more than five billion ecus ($5.6 billion) in compensation and corrective measures by the end of 1998, has been blamed on intensive production methods and relaxation of meat production rules.</p>
