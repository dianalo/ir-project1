<headline>S&amp;P assigns Int'l Bank of Asia's rating.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-11-14</dateline>

<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Thursday it had assigned a BBB long-term rating to International Bank of Asia Ltd's HK$500 million negotiable floating-rate certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>S&amp;P also said it had assigned a BBB long-term counterparty credit rating and an A3 short-term counterparty credit rating to the company.</p>
<p>The outlook is stable, it said.  </p>
<p>The ratings reflected the bank's very good financial profile, diversified business mix, and well-focused management and strategy, it said.</p>
<p>Inherent in the ratings were the sensitives associated with exposures to the Hong Kong property market and operating in the Hong Kong economy, and the bank's small market share, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>The bank's balance sheet was quite conservatively structured with a statutory liquidity ratio of over 40 percent and a loan-to-assets ratio of 63 percent at June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Capital levels were good and had recently been enhanced by a HK$495 million (US$64 million) capital placement and subscription, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>With expectations of the Hong Kong economy continuing to perform satisfactorily, the bank's profitability should be maintained at very good levels into the medium term, it said, adding that the bank's asset quality was high.</p>
<p>But S&amp;P said it did not expect the bank to be able to maintain the current low levels of non-performing loans as some increase in the level of problem loans was anticipated for International Bank of Asia and other Hong Kong banks.</p>
