<p>Five Russian Interior Ministry troops were killed when an armoured personnel carrier went off a bridge and crashed into a river near the separatist Chechnya region, the Interior Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>A ministry spokesman said five other servicemen had survived the accident near Pervomaiskoye on Thursday evening in Dagestan, which borders Chechnya in southern Russia. He did not say what had caused the vehicle to go off the bridge.</p>
<p>The accident happened hours after 11 cadets were killed when their slum-like barracks collapsed in the western Siberian town of Tomsk on Thursday.</p>
<p>The death toll in Tomsk could have been higher, but Itar-Tass news agency said only half the 120 people who should have been sleeping in the barracks were there at the time of the collapse. It said the funerals would take place on Saturday.</p>
