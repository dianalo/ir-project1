<headline>Republican divisions won't derail budget - Clinton.</headline>
<dateline>DENVER 1997-06-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Clinton said on Sunday that he does expect divisions among Republican lawmakers to derail a balanced budget deal.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect that to be prohibitive,&quot; Clinton told a news conference after the close of the summit of industrial nations here.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich has come in for criticism recently from some other Republican lawmakers for the way he handled a bill to provide disaster aid to North and South Dakota and other states.  </p>
<p>Clinton voiced a variety of concerns about Senate  proposals to force affluent seniors to pay more under the government's Medicare health plan and to raise the eligibility age under the program.</p>
<p>Democrats and Rrepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee last week unanimously approved wide-ranging budget legislation that includes that provision.</p>
<p>Clinton said that such proposals were outside the confines of the broad balanced budget deal he has struck with Congress and noted that agreement already contains cost-savings for Medicare.</p>
<p>He also questioned whether a gradual increase in the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65 would leave some seniors without health coverage.</p>
<p>&quot;Philosophically I (am) not opposed to means testing Medicare,&quot; Clinton added. But he said that such a proposal might make it more difficult to pass a detailed balanced budget agreement in the House.</p>
