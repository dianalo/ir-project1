<p>Hungarian share prices closed mixed on Friday, pulling the BUX index lower as the market's downward correction entered its second day, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at a preliminary 7,162.40 points, down 56.80 points or 0.79 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the market's recent rally, which bolstered the BUX index by eight percent, justified the downward correction but gave no reason to believe the market's long-term upward trend would change.</p>
<p>But they added they expected a virtually stagnant market in the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;I think today's fall fully fits in with expectations,&quot; said Geza Raner of Bank Austria-Investment Rt. &quot;It's just a cautious decline, there might be a 0.5 percent dip (on Monday) then the market will become flat.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader also believed the market would turn calmer for a while but he attributed this to summer holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors are starting their holidays and I think smaller funds are closing their positions,&quot; the trader said. &quot;However, I think, they are doing so mainly in London (on SEAQ) and price falls on SEAQ leave their impact in Budapest.&quot;</p>
<p>Frances Cloud, analyst at Nomura Equity Research in London said, the upcoming earnings reporting period might raise slight concerns, but will eventually leave the market little changed.</p>
<p>&quot;There's some very, very gentle profit-taking, and maybe a bit of slightly increasing caution ahead of reporting of the first half figures,&quot; Cloud said. &quot;The market will do very little until we see the results.&quot;</p>
<p>Bourse listed companies have to submit their first half earnings reports to the exchange by August 15.</p>
<p>On Friday chemicals TVK finished at 3,665 forints, down 35; oil and gas firm MOL at 4,250 forints, down 25; pharmaceuticals Richter remained steady at 17,150.</p>
