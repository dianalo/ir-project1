<p>Shenzhen's B share index ended higher on Friday, lifted by a strong rise in the A share market as fears eased over a possible market clampdown, analysts said.</p>
<p>The foreign currency B share index gained 3.01 points or 1.71 percent to 179.62 on turnover of HK$167.55 million, against Thursday's HK$215.08 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The solid A share gains boosted sentiment in the B share market,&quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said.</p>
<p>The domestic currency A share index gained 23.22 points or 4.63 percent to 525.14 on turnover of 17.4 billion yuan, compared with 20.2 billion yuan on Thursday.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the B index fell 3.35 percent to 176.61 points, following the A share index which tumbled 5.97 percent to end at 501.92 on jitters over a possible government crackdown on China's soaring stock markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index rebounded on Friday after the rumoured clampdown failed to materialise, analysts said.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong newspaper had said on Thursday that China's Ministry of Finance was considering increasing stamp tax on stock trading to 0.4 or 0.5 percent from 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect the B index to trade in a narrow range with an upward bias early next week.  </p>
<p>&quot;As long as the government does not introduce measures over the weekend (to cool the markets), an expected strong A share performance will likely drag the B index up,&quot; the Guotai analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were fairly hefty buying orders towards the end of the session today, indicating a positive opening on Monday,&quot; an analyst at J&amp;A Securities said.</p>
<p>On the B share market, refrigerator maker Hefei Meran Co Ltd was the star, gaining HK$0.68 or 7.44 percent to HK$9.82. It was also the most actively traded counter with volume of 3.5 million shares.  </p>
<p>On the A share market, retailer Qingdao Dongfang, which was listed on Friday, ended up 11.28 yuan or 197.89 percent at 16.98 yuan.</p>
