<p>The Austrian government said on Tuesday the hotly-contested sale of Creditanstalt to the country's biggest bank, Bank Austria, was the only possible option to end the seven-year privatisation process.</p>
<p>The government of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel's conservatives struck a last-minute deal at the weekend on the privatisation after a row over the buyer had split the coalition.</p>
<p>Vranitzky told a special session of parliament that the agreement was the &quot;biggest economic decision in Austria's recent history&quot;, adding there had been no alternative to Bank Austria since the market leader had made the best offer for the state's 70 percent voting stake in Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sold to the highest bidder. Everything else would have been unthinkable, not just in terms of the state budget,&quot; Vranitzky said.</p>
<p>Creditanstalt's privatisation has dragged on for seven years.</p>
<p>In the final stages the conservatives had baulked at a sale to Bank Austria, openly preferring a rival bid from an international group led by insurer EA-Generali, and threatened to team up with the far-right opposition Freedom Party of Joerg Haider in parliament to block the agreement.</p>
<p>Haider said the conservatives had missed a historic chance to remove political influence from Austria's banking system.</p>
<p>Bank Austria is effectively controlled by the Social Democrat-led City of Vienna. According to the deal, the bank will be taken out of public control step by step over the next seven years.</p>
<p>&quot;This could have been a great hour for Austria's economic renewal,&quot; Haider said, directing his comments at Schuessel. &quot;But you didn't have the power to see it through. You have become the laughing stock of Austria.&quot;</p>
<p>Schuessel won concessions from the Social Democrats in the deal, including a buyout of small Creditanstalt shareholders by Bank Austria and a job guarantee for Creditanstalt employees.</p>
<p>He told parliament the conservatives remained worried about Bank Austria's ability to finance the purchase price of 17.2 billion schillings ($1.54 billion) out of its capital resources without threatening its own financial health.</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement wasn't easy for us. But we will do everything we can to make this story a success story,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is up to the new owners of Creditanstalt to prove that they care about more than just shareholder value,&quot; Schuessel added. &quot;One thing is clear: The most important thing in the banking world is not capital, but the people who work there and the customers who bring their money.&quot; ($1=11.15 Schilling)</p>
