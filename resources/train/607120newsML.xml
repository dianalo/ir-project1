<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks remain weak at lunch break.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks remain weak at lunch break.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thai stocks, which rallied on Wednesday, retreated slightly by the lunch break on Thursday as investors sold stocks and took profits, brokers said.</p>
<p>But losses were curbed by light buying from a market support fund set up by bankers, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a market support fund continued buying this morning from yesterday but not actively. Investors, including foreigners, decided to sell as they awaited any possibility of a cut in interest rates by commercial banks,&quot; said Bumnan Liumsuwan of Asia Credit. The SET index dropped 3.28 points to 592.91 on 2.6 billion baht turnover by lunch.  </p>
<p>Brokers said a U.S. Federal Reserve Board decision earlier this week not to raise interest rates was good news and would give more room for the central and local banks to lower rates.</p>
<p>Thai Bankers Association chief Olarn Chaiprawat said on Wednesday the Bank of Thailand was likely to cut its discount rate in coming days to trigger interest rates cuts by commercial banks. But the central bank has not said when it will cut the rate while the finance ministry has hinted a cut is on the way.</p>
<p>Krung Thai Bank topped the active list by lunch, slipping 0.25 baht to 31.50.</p>
