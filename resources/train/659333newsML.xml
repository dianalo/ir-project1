<p>Jakarta stocks ended higher on Friday on late buying across the board, boosted by improved sentiment in property and banking issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The index started to move up after being flat for almost two week, helped by sustained buying in property and banking stocks,&quot; Harumi Cempaka, analyst with Asian Development Securities, said. She expected a series of initial public offerings in the coming week would give a further boost to the market and maintain the upward trend.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index closed 3.4 points, or 0.49 percent, higher at 698.62 points.  </p>
<p>Total turn-over was estimated at 500 billion rupiah, with the combined finance and property sectors contributing about 20 percent to the total.</p>
<p>The manufacturing sector, which contains the largest number of issues, also contributed about 100 billion rupiah to the turnover.</p>
<p>The index rose 3.6 points on the week.</p>
<p>Brokers said encouraging first quarter results of some property stocks such as PT Kawasan Industri Jababeka and Ciputra Development had helped improve sentiment.  </p>
<p>Jababeka said on Friday it posted net profit of 67 billion rupiah in the 1997 first quarter against 23 billion rupiah in the same 1996 period.</p>
<p>&quot;Developers such as Ciputra have shown very promising growth in terms of sales and net income. There is no reason to put off buying it,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Improved sentiment in banking stocks was due to higher earnings prospects of the industry, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Reports that the government is studying the possibility of mergers among state-owned banks has also given a positive sign to the financial industry,&quot; Lin Che Wei, research director of Socgen Cosby, said.  </p>
<p>Wei also said the declining trend in deposit rates combined with relatively stable lending rates had lifted sentiment on banking stocks as they could maintain higher profit margins.</p>
