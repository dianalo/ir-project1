<title>VATICAN: Pope appeals to hostage-takers to free captives.</title>
<headline>Pope appeals to hostage-takers to free captives.</headline>

<p>Pope John Paul, in an apparent appeal to Marxist guerrillas holding 74 hostages in Peru, urged kidnappers and hostage-takers on Sunday to free their captives as a &quot;gesture of humanity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The mercy of Christ, born of human weakness, urges hostage-takers to fulfil this gesture of humanity -- free these people,&quot; the Pope said. His made no direct reference to the Peru crisis, now in its 19th day, but said his thoughts and prayers were with families missing loved ones over the Christmas period.</p>
<p>The Polish Pontiff, speaking to pilgrims in St Peter's Square at his regular Sunday address, singled out for particular attention &quot;people taken hostage or who have disappeared in mysterious circumstances&quot;.</p>
<p>He said that liberating captives would be &quot;a gesture that will fill with joy those who are waiting for it, but will also give peace to they (the hostage-takers) themselves&quot;.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) stormed the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima on December 17 and took more than 400 diplomats and officials attending a party hostage to press for the release of 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody in here is giving up,&quot; the rebels said in a defiant banner flown from the rooftop on Saturday.</p>
<p>Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has ruled out the release of the rebels' jailed comrades and rejected their claim to be fighting for Peru's poor, condemning them as &quot;terrorists&quot;.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported on Sunday that the rebels had originally demanded $100 million as a &quot;war tax&quot; from Japanese companies but were now seeking $30 million.</p>
<p>Red Cross mediator Michel Minnig met the rebels on Saturday but left empty handed after two hours of talks.</p>
<p>Officials and negotiatiors fear the standoff is worsening and see no swift end to the crisis.</p>
