<p>Cyprus is launching an advertising campaign this year to woo foreign investors after easing decades-old restrictions on investments.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Cyprus is organising seminars in the United States, Canada and Germany on investment prospects, which were boosted recently when the cabinet relaxed regulations setting a ceiling on foreign participation in local businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past for every application that came in, even for a very small amount of shares in a company, we had to refer the case to the competent ministry,&quot; said Iakovos Pashos, Senior Manager and Head of the International Division of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Now in most cases the applications will be handled by the central bank alone,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under new regulations published last month, foreign investment of up to 100 percent is allowed in secondary industries, such as clothing, footwear, plastics, leather goods and furniture, which form the traditional core of Cyprus's manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Foreign participation in these sectors was previously confined to a maximum of 24 percent.</p>
<p>Previous restrictions kept foreign involvement in local business at a minimum, although the island has a thriving offshore sector. More than 27,000 foreign companies have registered in Cyprus since the first tax incentives started to be offered in 1975.</p>
<p>&quot;On a local level we don't have much foreign participation because we were restrictive,&quot; says Pashos. &quot;They (foreign investors) were interested in investing in the traditional industries or in trade and we were restrictive in both.&quot;</p>
<p>Gradual deregulation of the system -- which harks back to the 1940s when the island was still a British colony -- is part of Cyprus's drive to modernise its laws to make it eligible to become a member of the European Union. It is due to start entry talks next year.</p>
<p>Inward and outward investment restrictions emanate from a 1940 Exchange Control Law enacted by Britain after the outbreak of the World War II that Cyprus inherited on independence in 1960.</p>
<p>Cyprus was a member of the &quot;Sterling Area,&quot; a group of mainly Commonwealth countries which imposed exchange controls beyond their members and kept the majority of their foreign reserves in the British pound.</p>
<p>&quot;Until 1972 Cypriots were free to remit funds to the U.K. and to other former colonies. We could send money to London as easily as one could send it from Nicosia to Paphos,&quot; said Pashos, referring to the coastal resort on the island's western coast.</p>
<p>&quot;Then in June 1972 we got a message from the Bank of England that the Sterling Area was dismantled. From that day onwards we had these controls,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new investment regulations are focused on sectors where foreign interest has been greatest, Pashos said.</p>
<p>Control of the leisure industry is to remain in Cypriot hands under the new regulations, with maximum foreign participation of 49 percent in restaurants and recreational centres.</p>
<p>A maximum of 49 percent also holds in the hotel industry, though this does not apply to infrastructure projects to enrich tourism -- such as golf courses, theme parks and marinas -- where foreign ownership can be 100 percent, Pashos said.</p>
<p>But foreigners are still barred from land development, operating utility services like telecommunications, postal services and electricity, and ownership in tertiary education.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot say they are as liberal as we wanted them to be although the central bank and the government tried to be as liberal as possible,&quot; Pashos admitted. &quot;I believe it is a first step and others will follow.&quot;</p>
