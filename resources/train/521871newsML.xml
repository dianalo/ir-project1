<headline>Investors, analysts hail BT, MCI, Telefonica deal.</headline>

<p>British Telecommunications Plc said on Friday it had formed a global telecoms alliance with U.S. group MCI Communications Corp and Spain's Telefonica de Espana SA.</p>
<p>Analysts said the partners would benefit from the pact which gave them a formidable position in the Latin American market. The companies said that market could be worth more than $60 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>BT said it would take a two percent stake in Telefonica, while the Spanish company would buy a one percent holding in BT. The crossholdings would cost around 280 million pounds ($457.2 million) each.</p>
<p>Telefonica said in the joint statement that it was also taking steps to leave its Unisource alliance with U.S. group AT&amp;T Corp and three other European telecom companies.</p>
<p>The companies said the alliance would &quot;reshape the global telecommunications landscape&quot; and enable them to combine resources and exploit opportunities across the Americas and Europe.</p>
<p>London investors hailed the deal, sending BT shares higher in a weakening market. BT hit an intraday high of 450 pence, up 7 1/2 pence.</p>
<p>Analysts said the terms of the alliance were favourable and welcomed Telefonica's move to abandon its link with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news although it has been expected in the market and it looks like Telefonica has paid 440p for BT share, which should lend some support,&quot; said Jim McCafferty, analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett in London.</p>
<p>The deal was widely expected. Portugal Telecom earlier this week signed up to join Concert -- the company formed by a merger of BT and MCI -- and the Portuguese company had let slip in its own announcement a reference to Telefonica joining up with MCI.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Telefonica International SA (TISA) and MCI will create a pan-American joint venture, with each partner holding 50 percent.</p>
<p>MCI and Telefonica would also set up a marketing arrangement to target the Hispanic community in the U.S., currently estimated at more than 28 million people, the companies said.</p>
