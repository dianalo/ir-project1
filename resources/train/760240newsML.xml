<headline>Puma stock jumps on takeover talk, company is silent.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stock in German sportswear maker Puma AG soared in Frankfurt even after Italian clothing giant Benetton denied market talk it was interested in acquiring the German group.</p>
<p>By 10:21 a.m. EDT, Puma shares, traded on the electronic IBIS DAX system, were the session's biggest gainers, rising 5.16 percent to 55 marks ($102), reflecting a jump from the 54.90-mark ($101) market close.</p>
<p>Analysts said talk that Italian fashion group Benetton might be considering snapping up the southern German group was the only reason for the sharp price jump. Puma posted slightly disappointing results Friday, prompting several banks to downgrade their recommendations.</p>
<p>Benetton, however, said it was not interested. When asked about the market talk in Germany, a spokeswoman said &quot;This is not true.&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly Puma officials brushed off the talk. Puma Chief Financial Officer Dieter Bock told Reuters &quot;We think that this talk is solely based on rumours,&quot; adding &quot;our company has nothing to substantiate such talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Monday's stock price rise, which surprised many dealers, occurred despite news that U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs and German bank Commerzbank both downgraded the company's stock after Friday's half-year results.</p>
<p>Commerzbank put Puma on hold, having had them on buy, while Goldman Sachs labeled the shares a market performer.</p>
<p>Even though the market talk has been denied, analysts said the suggestion Benetton could be eyeing Puma was not entirely ludicrous and might still be able to drive the stock price higher for a short while.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were unsure where Puma stocks might head from here, having had their earlier predictions of a dip in prices on an official denial proved wrong.</p>
