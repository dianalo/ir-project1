<p>Asian stock markets were mixed on Tuesday, with some exchanges taking their cue from a record closing high on Wall Street while others moved to the beat of a variety of local factors.</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks roared ahead when trading resumed after Monday's public holiday, with shares gaining more than two percent at one point.</p>
<p>&quot;The bulls on Wall Street are chasing the Nikkei average higher today,&quot; said Kenzo Doi, an analyst at Kokusai Securities.</p>
<p>At 0545 GMT, the key Nikkei 225-share average was up 459.21, or 2.2 percent, at 21,301.85.</p>
<p>Wall Street steamed ahead on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at one point topping the 5,900 level before ending 51 points up at a record closing high of 5,889.</p>
<p>Expectations that U.S. economic data and moderate inflation would not prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates when its policy makers meet next week spurred the U.S. market ahead by some 179 points last week.</p>
<p>Although many traders remain optimistic that a rise in interest rates will not occur, others still believe the Central Bank could make a preemptive move against inflation and raise rates a modest quarter of a percentage point.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks had surged to a new 1996 high by midday.</p>
<p>At the break, the Hang Seng Index was up 33.94 points, or 0.29 percent, at 11,601.84. The previous intraday high for the year was 11,600 set in February.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment is good,&quot; said Ronald Lam, chief dealer at Dao Heng Securities in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;I am more positive now because the underlying fundamentals have changed,&quot; said David williamson, sales director at UBS Securities (East Asia) Ltd.</p>
<p>He said a drop below the psychologically important seven percent barrier in the yield of the U.S. government's 30-year bond -- a barometer of other interest rates -- suggested the Fed would not tighten monetary policy in the near term.</p>
<p>Wall Street's gains also spurred a sharp rise in Singapore, where the Straits Times Index was up 23.85 points, or 1.11 per cent, at 2,178.34.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is driven by high liquidity due to Wall Street and overall firmness in the regional markets,&quot; said a broker with a European bank in Singapore. &quot;There is also a fresh flow of funds into Singapore,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, renewed foreign institutional interest and continued retail buying helped support the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's been in hibernation for some time, and now, it's a wake-up call,&quot; said an institutional dealer with a foreign firm in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>The key Composite Index was up 2.60 points, or 0.23 percent, at 1,134.15.</p>
<p>Philippine stocks were up 26.05 points or 0.81 percent at 3,259.72, while in Indonesia shares gained 2.74 points or 0.49 percent to 557.14.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, Thai stocks remained pressured by political concerns ahead of a no-confidence debate in parliament against the prime minister which begins on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thai stocks were off 13.78 points, or 1.30 percent, at 1,045.09.</p>
<p>Stocks in Taiwan eased 40 points or 0.61 percent to 6,478.44, nearing a major technical resistance level. South Korean stocks were marginally lower at 529.81, off 0.23 points, or 0.04 percent, amid concerns over a large amount of margin loans that need to be repaid.</p>
<p>Soft commodities prices pushed Australian stocks lower. The All Ordinaries index was off 3.90 points at 2,263.9 at the midday break in Sydney.</p>
<p>The dollar was immobile at around 110 yen at midday in Tokyo after easing earlier on profit-taking. It stood steady against the mark.</p>
<p>Oil futures prices eaked out small gains after a major slump overnight.</p>
<p>November North Sea Brent futures were quoted at US$21.75/$21.90 per barrel in Singapore, up from London's close of $21.60. Brent prices plunged more than $1.50 per barrel in London on rumours the United States had asked Saudi Arabia to increase output to make up for delayed Iraqi oil exports.</p>
<p>Middle East Gulf sources later denied the U.S. had asked the world's biggest oil producer to intervene.</p>
