<p>Opinion polls show Bolivia's future president will be either Gen. Hugo Banzer, ex-President Jaime Paz Zamora or ruling party hopeful Juan Carlos Duran.</p>
<p>Sunday's vote is likely to produce no clear winner and to be decided by a vote in Congress in early August. Following are brief profiles of the main three contenders:</p>
<p>GEN. HUGO BANZER</p>
<p>Gen. Hugo Banzer seized power in 1971 and ruled with an iron fist after Ernesto (Che) Guevara's Marxist guerrillas were defeated in the late 1960s.  </p>
<p>He has since run five times for president. Despite winning the popular vote in 1985, he failed to garner a majority under local laws and was defeated in second round voting, which takes place in Congress.</p>
<p>Banzer, 71, founded his right-wing Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) party eight months after he was toppled in 1978.</p>
<p>The general says he believes it was his duty to stage a coup in 1971, but that he has now embraced democracy.</p>
<p>He says that if he becomes president he will revise the contracts of privatized firms to eliminate their monopolies.  </p>
<p>In 1993, he ran for president again but lost to Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the MNR, the outgoing president.</p>
<p>Banzer was born in Concepcion in 1926 and married Yolanda Prada, with whom he had five children. He describes himself as a native of the provinces who started his studies in a small rural school.</p>
<p>JAIME PAZ ZAMORA</p>
<p>Former president Jaime Paz Zamora, candidate of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), is trying to return to office.  </p>
<p>Paz Zamora's bid for president has been marred by accusations of links to drug-traffickers, which caused the United States to ban him early last year.</p>
<p>Although the White House says its refusal to grant him an entry visa should not interfere with domestic politics, President Sanchez de Lozada says Paz Zamora's return to office would lead to Bolivia being shunned by the global community.  </p>
<p>Paz Zamora succeeded his uncle Victor Paz Estenssoro after drawn out political haggling following a tight election in 1989. A former revolutionary turned social democrat, Paz Zamora came third in the poll, but he took over in an unlikely alliance with his enemy and former military ruler Hugo Banzer.</p>
<p>His austerity programs caused social unrest and he also came under fire for using the army in the fight against drugs.</p>
<p>Under pressure from the opposition, he halted the military drive and offered immunity from extradition to the United States to traffickers willing to face Bolivian courts. Around a dozen accepted and served jail terms.  </p>
<p>Paz Zamora was born in 1939 in the city of Cochabamba and is married to Viviana Limpias, his second wife. He has five sons from his first marriage.</p>
<p>In 1980, he survived a plane crash caused by an attack which left him permanently scarred on his face and hands.</p>
<p>JUAN CARLOS DURAN</p>
<p>Juan Carlos Duran, the candidate of the ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), is considered the natural heir to President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who launched an austerity program and privatizations in 1993.  </p>
<p>Duran is a veteran with 15 years of parliamentary experience who climbed slowly through the MNR ranks until he was appointed deputy leader in 1993 representing the so-called &quot;new generations&quot; which supported Sanchez de Lozada.</p>
<p>A lawyer, Duran was born in La Paz 47 years ago and is married to Heidy Bohme Arze. They have two children.</p>
<p>He was presidential chief of staff during Celso Torrelio's military regime in 1981-1982 and Interior and Justice Minister during Victor Paz Estenssoro's 1988-1989 government.</p>
<p>Duran was first elected deputy in 1982 and later became a senator, serving three consecutive terms as Senate speaker.</p>
<p>He became the party's campaign chief in 1993 when Sanchez de Lozada won and was appointed campaign chief again last December before becoming the party's candidate.</p>
