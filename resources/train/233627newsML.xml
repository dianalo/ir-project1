<p>A politician opposed to Nigeria's military government, Olabiyi Durojaiye, has been detained by security forces, his associate said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Veteran opposition lawyer Abraham Adesanya told journalists Durojaiye was arrested by seven men at around 4.a.m (0300 GMT) on Tuesday after they searched  home at Ikeja, near Lagos.</p>
<p>Adesanya said he did not know where Durojaiye had been taken.</p>
<p>There has been no official confirmation of the arrest.</p>
<p>Durojaiye is a former presidential aspirant who lost in his bid for the nomination of one of the political parties in annulled elections in 1993.</p>
<p>The presumed winner of the election, Moshood Abiola, has been among dozens of political detainees since he declared himself president in 1994 in defiance of the military.</p>
<p>Africa's most populous nation is been under fire from Western countries for human rights abuses and lack of democracy.</p>
<p>Three prominent prisoners were released last month to coincide with a visit by a delegation of the Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies.</p>
