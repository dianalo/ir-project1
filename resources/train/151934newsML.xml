<p>The dollar continued its upward march against the yen in Tokyo trade on Tuesday, coming within reach of 115 yen as monetary officials on both sides of the Pacific voiced little concern over its rapid rise.</p>
<p>The greenback shot to fresh 42-month highs, spurred by the belief that financial authorities will do little to check its advance and that Japanese interest rates will stay low, giving investors an incentive to shun the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the situation warrants special attention,&quot; Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told reporters, adding that the dollar was still in the process of an &quot;orderly reversal&quot; of its dive to historic lows last year.</p>
<p>Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin also said he was not concerned about the dollar's recent rise.</p>
<p>Asked in a taped interview with CNN television whether he shared the concern among corporations and on Wall Street that the dollar had risen too high, Rubin said: &quot;No&quot;.</p>
<p>The comments pushed the dollar up to 114.92 yen, its highest level since April 1993, but it slipped back to around 114.35 yen in afternoon trade, just above its late level in New York trading on Monday. This compares with the dollar's post-war low of just under 80 yen set around 18 months ago.</p>
<p>Dealers said the officials' comments made them less hesitant in pushing the dollar higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubin's comments were what boosted the dollar a step higher from 114.80 yen to the day's high,&quot; said Tatsuo Ogawa, deputy general manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>The dollar's rise accelerated on Monday after it broke through a key psychological barrier, or resistance point, at 113.60 yen. Dealers had been reluctant to push the dollar up to 113.60 yen as it had widely been viewed as the level at which U.S. authorities would voice displeasure.</p>
<p>Although the dollar's overall sentiment had been further boosted by the comments, dealers said there was a feeling that it had risen rapidly.</p>
<p>They said the market was still sensitive to any comments sounding alarm about the dollar's rise, and said the profit-taking was triggered by another part of Kubo's comments.</p>
<p>Kubo said that Japan may need to seriously consider measures regarding the currency market if fluctuations become too sudden or fail to reflect economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>Some dealers also said U.S. authorities' apparent nonchalance about the dollar's rise may change after U.S. presidential elections set for November 5.</p>
<p>They said President Bill Clinton, widely expected to stay in power for a second term, may opt to give more consideration to the interests of U.S. exporters, and shift the emphasis away from keeping inflation and interest rates down.</p>
<p>The present administration is regarded as keen to keep U.S. interest rates low ahead of the election, dealers added.</p>
<p>But dealers expect the dollar to stay strong against the yen regardless of monetary authorities' intentions, backed by the continued flow of Japanese funds into higher yielding overseas investments.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that ultra-low interest rates in Japan will continue to support the dollar,&quot; said Youichi Itoh, deputy general manager with Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking Co.</p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond dipped below 2.6 percent on Tuesday for the first time since December 1995. The comparable yield on the U.S. Treasury's 10-year note closed at 6.56 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Japan's central bank has kept interest rates low to nurture the nation's tentative economic recovery.</p>
