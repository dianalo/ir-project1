<p>Shawn Kemp scored 34 points and Gary Payton 31 as the Seattle SuperSonics outlasted the Washington Bullets 115-110 in double overtime Wednesday for their ninth straight victory.</p>
<p>Hersey Hawkins had a key steal and Sam Perkins made two free throws with 7.8 seconds left in the second extra session to seal Seattle's 10th victory in 12 games this season.</p>
<p>&quot;We were very tired, we fought hard and we hung on,&quot; Seattle coach George Karl said.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't very pretty, but it's a road win. I'm just glad we're playing winning basketball, because we're not playing good basketball.&quot;</p>
<p>Detlef Schrempf had 23 points and 15 rebounds for Seattle, which has won 14 of its last 15 meetings with the Bullets.</p>
<p>&quot;They made us beat them,&quot; Kemp said. &quot;We used our heads and played a simple game in the end. We made some smart decisions down the stretch, but we're still not playing well.&quot;</p>
<p>Chris Webber poured in 34 points on 15-of-24 from the field and added 13 rebounds, five assists and seven blocks for the Bullets, who have alternated wins and losses in their last five contests.</p>
<p>&quot;We never gave up and we kept fighting,&quot; Juwan Howard said. &quot;We ran out of steam in the end. We couldn't hit the shot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The best aspect of this game is that we saw a a lot of heart on the court,&quot; Bullets coach Jim Lynam said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were just very tired at the end.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bullets trailed 92-76 with 5:18 left in regulation before storming back with a 21-5 run to tie it 97-97 and force ovetime. Chris Whitney made a pair of three-pointers and had seven points and Webber added seven during the run.</p>
<p>Webber scored all 10 Bullets points in the first OT.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I played a good game, but we came up short in the end,&quot; Webber said. &quot;They are a great team.&quot;</p>
<p>In Phoenix, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen scored 37 points apiece and combined to score the team's first 25 points as the Bulls remained unbeaten by breezing to a 113-99 victory over the winless Phoenix Suns.</p>
<p>Dennis Rodman grabbed 16 rebounds for Chicago, which extended the best start in franchise history to 11-0. The NBA record for most wins to start the season is 15.</p>
<p>Phoenix is off to the worst start in franchise history at 0-10, eclipsing its previous mark set in 1985-86.</p>
<p>In Boston, Grant Hill scored 23 points and Lindsey Hunter added 22 as the Detroit Pistons beat the Celtics 108-83 for their fifth straight win.</p>
<p>The Pistons stopped a five-game losing streak at Boston and are now 5-0 on the road. Detroit (9-1) is off to its best start since beginning the 1970-71 season with a 12-1 record.</p>
<p>Rookie Antoine Walker had 18 points and a season-high nine rebounds for the Celtics.</p>
<p>In Charlotte, Vlade Divac scored 11 of his 23 points in the fourth quarter as the Hornets took advantage of sloppy play down the stretch by the New York Knicks for a 93-86 win.</p>
<p>Ex-Knick Anthony Mason added 20 points for Charlotte, which snapped a four-game losing streak and avenged a loss at New York on November 3.</p>
<p>Patrick Ewing scored 18 points for New York, which lost its first road game of the season and had a three-game winning streak halted.</p>
<p>Larry Johnson, who was dealt to New York in exchange for Mason and Brad Lohaus, had only nine points and three rebounds in 27 minutes in his return to Charlotte.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Reggie Miller scored 22 points and Travis Best added 18 as the Indiana Pacers pulled away in the second half for a 103-92 victory over the 76ers.</p>
<p>Indiana, which had lost four of their last five games, was still without centre Rik Smits.</p>
<p>In San Antonio, Loy Vaught had 20 points and eight rebounds to lead the Los Angeles Clippers to a 93-81 victory, over the Spurs.</p>
<p>The Clippers stopped a 12-game losing streak at San Antonio over seven years.</p>
<p>The Spurs again were without starting centre David Robinson and starting forward Charles Smith.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, Tim Hardaway scored 19 points and Isaac Austin added 17 and nine rebounds to lead the Miami Heat to a 94-75 victory over the Grizzlies.</p>
