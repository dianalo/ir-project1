<p>Brazil's debt took center stage in emerging market debt trade with the debut of a nascent benchmark.</p>
<p>But some traders and analysts expected the excitement over Brazil to wane quickly now that the high-profile deal was done.</p>
<p>The $3 billion 30-year dollar bond was priced at 395 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, and the spread tightened by some 15 to 20 basis points in secondary trading.  </p>
<p>The daily range was 95.50 to 94.80 after being issued at 93.234. In late afternoon trading, it was bid at 95.20 and offered at 95.35, according to trading sources.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, you have seen as much 'flipping' as you would in the short-term,&quot; said Tulio Vera, a managing director responsible for Latin America sovereign credit analysis at Bear Stearns and Co.</p>
<p>As the most complex Latin global bond issue to date, the swap offer involved an exchange of Brady bonds as well as limited cash tender. It energized the languishing Brazil Brady market since the announcement on May 21, traders said.  </p>
<p>Brazil par, discount and C bonds -- eligible bonds for the exchange -- rallied sharply to trade above the invitation clearing level, which made the cash tender an apparently better choice for the investors intending to own the new bond.</p>
<p>But the cash tender was capped at 25 percent of the final size of the global bond. It then became widely expected that the global bond would be priced at a wider spread to compensate for the difference between the invitation and the market price for the Brady bond holders, they said.  </p>
<p>Traders had suggested that a 15-basis-point premium was built into the issuing price and the subsequent spread tightening was expected.</p>
<p>Because of the structure favoring cash option, not surprisingly tender for outright purchase exceeded $16 billion, noted Dan Peirce, emerging market fixed income strategist at BancBoston Securities.</p>
<p>The oversubscription should not be construed as a form of pent-up demand for any Brazil bond and further rise in secondary trading was uncertain, he warned.  </p>
<p>&quot;We see limited upside after some immediate tightening,&quot; he said, noting that Brazil's fiscal deficit and sluggish reform process kept investors wary.</p>
<p>At 40 basis points wider than Mexico's 30-year global bond, the new Brazil issue would be hard pressed to squeeze the spread tighter, he said.</p>
<p>UMS 26, unchanged on the day at 111-3/8, had a spread of about 330 basis point, according to traders. The sovereign credit of Mexico is rated higher at BB by S&amp;P and Ba2 by Moody's, compared to BB-minus and B1 for Brazil.  </p>
<p>Marcelo Fleury, head of Brazil Desk at Garban Corp, noted that the turnover of the new global rivaled that of the most active &quot;C&quot; bond, but refrained from predicting if the global would overtake C bond as benchmark.</p>
<p>&quot;It would open up arbitrage opportunities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The C bond  BR8D14=RR was unchanged at 79-3/8 bid; Discount bond  BRFLTD24=RR gained 3/8 at 83-1/4 bid and Par bond BR4D24=RR added 1/4 to 66-3/8 bid.</p>
