<headline>INSTANT VIEW - Finnish key rate cut.</headline>

<text>
<p>Following are comments from economists after the Bank of Finland said it was cutting its key tender rate by 10 basis points to 3.00 percent.</p>
<p>Teijo Rantatupa, OKOBANK Treasury Economist:</p>
<p>&quot;It must be some action before something about (a markka link to) ERM leaks, some action before markka gets too strong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they (the Bank of Finland) want a weaker markka they will have to cut the rate more again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Bank of Finland (is) preparing the ERM linking and that's their role in this play.&quot; </p>
<p>Asked if he felt the cut invited speculation about a markka-ERM link this weekend or soon, he said markets have discounted a link for the markka to Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't matter when it takes place -- the market has discounted it for two to three weeks now. It doesn't matter when it happens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The short-term money market has been dictating (a cut) for several days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel personally that there are a lot of pressures on the markka to strengthen now.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ari Aaltonen, Postipankki chief analyst:</p>
<p>&quot;This is pleasant ... I've been telling our clients this all day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is the same old story -- that is the markka is too strong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It (the markka) is too strong in a tactical sense, since when a link (for the markka to ERM) is negotiated, the starting point will be (the preceding) Friday's level and if that is strong, talks will be more difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a link was still possible any weekend this year except perhaps October 20 to 21, when all leading Finnish politicians would be engaged in local and European elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The cut did not increase the likelihood for a link next weekend.&quot;  </p>
<p>Risto Murto, chief economist at brokerage Selin Finance:</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the Bank of Finland does not want the markka to appreciate strongly before the ERM-link.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are in the waiting room, we are leaving the regime of a completely freely floating exchange rate behind and we are about to link (the markka) to ERM.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(But) it seems that it is quite difficult to steer the exchange rate trend by marginal interest rate moves.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked IF further key rate cuts lied ahead, Murto said: &quot;With this logic, yes. It is not out of the question that the Finnish tender rate could, temporarily, go below the German repo rate.&quot;  </p>
<p>Juha Lehtonen, analyst at Merita Bank:</p>
<p>&quot;This is an attempt to get the markka to a slightly softer level before its possible linkage to the ERM. It is very difficult to see any other explanation for the cut,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;After this it looks evident that they are taking the markka into the ERM.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the markka-ERM link) is more likely to come in the near future than late this year,&quot; he said, but declined to name any specific weekend. </p>
<p>&quot;I think there is still room to lower (tender rate). The markka is likely to remain strong, so the Bank of Finland may see room to cut tender rate further.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think Germany will not be an absolute floor, but it is obviously difficult to take tender rate much lower than that.&quot;</p>
