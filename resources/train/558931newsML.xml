<p>Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal on Monday unveiled plans, including new fees and licences, to conserve South Africa's scarce water resources.</p>
<p>Asmal said in a white paper on water policy, a discussion document which precedes the drafting of legislation, that a new system of allocating water would be introduced.</p>
<p>&quot;The system will use water pricing, limited term allocations and other administrative mechanisms to bring supply and demand into balance in a manner which is beneficial in the public interest,&quot; the document said.</p>
<p>&quot;The riparian system of allocation, in which the right to use water is tied to the ownership of the land along rivers, will effectively be abolished.&quot;</p>
<p>Asmal said the concept of ownership of water, like that pumped from boreholes, would be scrapped.</p>
<p>All water use would be subject to a catchment management charge and in some cases to a &quot;resource conservation&quot; charge. These charges would be waived if they hampered provision of water to the poor, Asmal said.</p>
<p>He said agriculture and mining would have to re-evaluate their consumption of water, saying crop irrigation accounted for about half the use of water in South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have to pay a price for water that reflects the real economic cost, including the indirect costs to society and the environment for their water use,&quot; Asmal said.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the new system, existing water users will have to apply for registration of their water use within a set time period. These applications will, where justified and possible, be converted into licences under the new law,&quot; he said.</p>
