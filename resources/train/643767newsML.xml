<p>The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in nearly 24 years in May but the pace of job growth slowed markedly, the government said Friday, in a report that sparked a powerful rally in financial markets.</p>
<p>The report, the government's first major glimpse of the economy's health each month, offered a mixed reading ahead of the Federal Reserve's early July meeting on interest rates.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said the unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent in May, the lowest level since October 1973, from April's 4.9 percent. But payrolls grew by just 138,000 after surging by 323,000. It was the slowest since the 36,000 jobs added outside of the farm sector in September.</p>
<p>Economists had predicted the unemployment rate would creep back up to 5.0 percent and had expected the economy to add 219,000 jobs in May. They said that, despite the slowdown in job growth, the report painted a picture of a remarkably healthy economy after more than six years of growth.</p>
<p>After growing at a sizzling 5.8 percent rate in the first quarter -- the fastest pace in nine years -- the economy has shown signs of slowing but remains robust, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is really in good shape,&quot; Nick Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group, said. &quot;We're generating jobs and the unemployment rate is low.&quot;</p>
<p>First Union chief bank economist Joel Naroff added: &quot;The labour market is cooking, workers are becoming more confident and there is minimal slack left for employers to take up.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors bet the report meant the Fed would hold rates steady next month after raising them earlier this year, and drove the Dow Jones industrial average up 131 points to 7,437 at midday, above the record set last month. The bond market also rallied, with the 30-year Treasury adding 1-1/4 points, lowering its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, to 6.78 percent from 6.88 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The figures -- especially the job growth reading -- can be volatile from month to month. But the data so far this year portray a labour market that is very tight, with payroll growth averaging 229,000 a month.</p>
<p>Fed policy-makers have been worried that the tight job market will encourage workers to demand big pay hikes, stoking inflation down the road. The central bank raised short-term rates in March in a bid to slow growth and ward off inflation, the first increase in more than two years. But it held rates steady last month, hoping the economy would slow on its own.</p>
<p>May's jobs numbers provide the Fed with reasons to hold rates steady or raise them. The slowdown in job growth argues for steady rates. But the drop in the unemployment rate buttresses those who believe that higher rates are needed.</p>
<p>&quot;The unemployment rate will put the Fed on alert,&quot; Dan Seto, economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said. &quot;As for payrolls, the labour market is tight. All indications suggest resurgence of growth. We think the Fed will raise rates in July.&quot;</p>
<p>As is usually the case, much of the growth in payrolls last month came in the service sector.</p>
<p>Construction employment also bounced back in May, after being depressed in April by unseasonably cool and wet weather. Manufacturing employment was essentially flat, however, held down by a strike in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Reflecting tightness in the labour market, average earnings rose by four cents an hour last month, to $12.19.</p>
<p>Despite pressure to pay workers more, businesses so far have managed to post solid profits while at the same time avoiding price increases. Economists say that was probably due to improvements in the productivity of the labour force.</p>
<p>&quot;The question for the Fed is whether the increase in wages is being paid for by the increase in worker productivity -- it seems to have been so far,&quot; said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business.</p>
<p>The trade group released a May survey of its members that showed hiring demand at near-record levels, with 16 percent of firms saying they planned to expand employment. Fully 30 percent of the companies surveyed reported that they raised employee compensation last month, Dunkelberg said.</p>
<p>The Labour department had previously reported that payrolls grew by 142,000 in April. The sharp upward revision reflected new seasonal adjustment factors and other changes meant to measure the job market more precisely.</p>
