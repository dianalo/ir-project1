<p>Asia Pacific finance ministers said on Sunday the region's economic outlook was positive and adopted initiatives to speed the flow of private funds to boost development.</p>
<p>Despite diverse views emerging during the weekend meeting on how to steer the region into becoming an open financial arena, APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance ministers were one in calling the talks successful.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very clear that when you look at what happened today, we have passed, long since passed, the point of discussions and all of the finance ministers are prepared to get down to very concrete implementation of what has been discussed,&quot; Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin said at a press conference.</p>
<p>Ministers set no specific time frames, however, and critics said that could mean reality will run well behind rhetoric when it comes to some reluctant members carrying out the measures.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to embark on closer cooperation among export financing institutions, strengthening of financial market supervision and clearing and settlement mechanisms, and developing domestic rating agencies, among other steps.</p>
<p>They also called for prompt resumption of the World Trade Organisation's financial services talks, and urged WTO members to agree to commitments on improving market access.</p>
<p>The APEC communique also noted that the major misalignment in exchange markets that existed in spring 1995 had now been corrected.</p>
<p>The ministers' statement predicted that the region would continue to expand and said overheating pressures in selected economies had abated.</p>
<p>It said the three key challenges facing APEC economies were to secure freer and stable flows of capital, facilitate private sector investment in infrastructure projects, and development of financial and capital markets.</p>
<p>The region needs an estimated $1.5 trillion to bankroll infrastructure projects in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very successful meeting. (The communique) constitutes the underpinnings for the development of the capital markets,&quot; U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said.</p>
<p>Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, reported to be one of the ministers wary of opening up domestic markets, said &quot;all member-economies should try their best to fulfil (the initiatives)&quot;.</p>
<p>A group of senior investment bankers and institutional fund managers also met the finance ministers, recommending a package of measures to immediately attain the objectives.</p>
<p>Malaysian Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwar said the ministers had welcomed the recommendations, but implementation would be paced according to the level of development in their respective markets.</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.</p>
