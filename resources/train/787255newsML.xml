<p>Wilson Kipketer, the Kenyan-born Dane with no need of a pacemaker, could become the first athlete to win the $100,000 bonus for breaking a world record at the world championships on Friday.</p>
<p>Kipketer broke the world indoor record twice running from the front at the world championships in Paris last March.</p>
<p>Last month in Stockholm, he took no notice of the pacemaker in the first lap but still recovered to equal Seb Coe's 16-year-old world mark of one minute 41.74 seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care about any of the other competitors, I just run my own race,&quot; he said after accelerating through the field to win his second round race easily on Tuesday.</p>
<p>British triple jumper Jonathan Edwards, who broke the world record twice at the Gothenburg world championships two years ago, will also be competing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Edwards, who prior to the championships had not competed for five weeks because of a heel injury, admitted he would be taking &quot;a step in the dark&quot;.</p>
<p>Merlene Ottey defends her world 200 metres title with her chances enhanced by the absence of double Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec who strained her right hamstring while warming up for her semifinal on Thursday.</p>
<p>Trinidad's Ato Boldon, who finished fifth in the 100 final on Sunday looked in impressive form on Thursday, winning his semifinal in 20.09.</p>
<p>His most dangerous rival on Friday should be 1993 world champion Frankie Fredericks of Namibia.</p>
