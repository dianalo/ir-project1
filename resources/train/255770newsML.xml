<headline>OPTIONS - B.A.T Inds continues active.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options in B.A.T Industries Plc continued active on Friday after a week in which the stock hit a four-month high amid demerger talk and as some investment funds bought stocks which had underperformed for much of the year.</p>
<p>Options specialists reported a call spread trade involving a sale of the January 460p calls and a purchase of the January 500p calls.</p>
<p>They said there had also been a buyer of 200 January 500p puts and a seller of 400 of the January 460p puts.</p>
<p>The stock was down 2-1/2p at 491 by 1610 GMT in active trade of 15 million shares.  </p>
<p>In ASDA Group Plc  ASSD.L, dealers highlighted a purchase of 600 July 120p calls in the stock, which was up 1/2p at 121-3/4 in heavy trading of 16.1 million shares.</p>
<p>And British Gas Plc was also active after a volatile week for the stock, partly due to a Financial Times report that major investment institutions were seriously underweight in the shares and would be looking to top up their holdings.</p>
<p>Dealers said 1,000 of the March 240p calls had been crossed at 9p.</p>
