<headline>Slovenian shares end week off, slow decline seen.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slovenian shares closed 1.36 percent lower on Friday and traders forecast the market could slide by another two to five percent as foreign investors remained absent.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are expected to set up special accounts for international buyers in two to three weeks. Until then shares may slowly decline,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The trader said if international investors decided to invest at least $0.6 million weekly in Slovenian shares, prices would start rising. Alternatively, reluctance to invest in Slovenian securities could push the index down significantly.</p>
<p>The 11-share SBI index fell 19.03 points to 1,385.03 but ended the week 15.63 points higher.</p>
<p>Bank SKB was the most active share, falling 3.40 percent to 56,900 tolars on volume of 1,184 shares for total turnover of 68.6 million tolars.</p>
<p>Turnover fell to 131.5 million tolars from 315 million. Overall eight shares fell, six rose, four were unchanged, seven untraded, while one was traded for the first time.</p>
<p>Brokerage Dadas led the day's decliners, falling 10.46 percent to 5,820 tolars on volume of 35 shares.</p>
<p>Brokerage Finmedia was the biggest gainer, jumping 7.69 percent to 14,000 tolars on volume of 326 shares.</p>
<p>Oils and aroma maker Etol, which on Friday traded on the Ljubljana bourse for the first time, closed at 17,000 tolars, down 2.9 percent from the opening price of 17,500.</p>
