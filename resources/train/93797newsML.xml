<p>Egypt said on Thursday that Israel's attitude at the Middle East crisis summit in Washington had not inspired optimism for the peace process.</p>
<p>The summit, called by U.S. President Bill Clinton after Israeli-Palestinian clashes in which 73 died, agreed only to continue negotiations between the two sides.</p>
<p>&quot;The existence of good will push the negotiations forward,&quot; Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters at Cairo airport at his return from U.N. general assembly meetings in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;But the Israeli attitude in Washington has not inspired optimism and reassurance for the negotiations' framework and future, and consequently for the future of the peace process,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Arabs dismissed the Washington summit, boycotted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, as a failure for peace and a victory for Israeli intransigence.</p>
<p>&quot;President Clinton exerted big efforts to contain the Israeli negative attitude,&quot; Moussa told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;But the result, as is known, was that the gathering could not bring the Israeli policy back to a path compatible with peace and its requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The (Israeli-Palestinian) negotiations cannot go on forever,&quot;  he added. &quot;All must... understand that they are not for wasting time, but to get the Palestinian track back to its right path.&quot;</p>
<p>Moussa said that the only way to get out of the current crisis is by the implementation of all agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;This will not happen until the agreed-upon accords are fulfilled, built upon and good will shown,&quot; he said, adding in clear refernce to Israel, &quot;This, we supposedly wait for, but we are not expecting.&quot;</p>
<p>Moussa said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will visit Egypt on Saturday at the invitation of Mubarak to continue their discussions over the latest developments in the region.</p>
