<headline>Swiss franc ends year quietly mixed.</headline>
<text>
<p>1300 GMT - The Swiss franc ended 1996 on a quiet note after dipping to the lowest levels in over two years against the dollar on Monday, with range trade the order of the day.</p>
<p>The dollar hovered below 1.35 Swiss francs during much of the abbreviated session, below Monday's high of 1.3536. Tuesday's high was 1.3515.</p>
<p>The mark continued its assault on three-year highs against the franc, ending up slightly from Monday's close. But it too held in a narrow range, staying below the 87.00-centime level.  </p>
<p>Activity was static before New Year's. Banks will be closed Wednesday for New Year's and banks in Zurich remain closed on Thursday. On Tuesday, trading rooms closed at 1300 GMT.</p>
<p>In Swiss bond markets some traders speculated that a dollar correction was on its way, citing that as a factor boosting prices of short-term Swiss debt paper. But some currency traders were more apt to predict a continuation of the trend towards a stronger dollar. *Dollar ends at 1.3466/3471 Swiss francs versus 1.3505/3515. *Mark ends at 86.86/89 centimes versus 86.79/82 on Monday.</p>
