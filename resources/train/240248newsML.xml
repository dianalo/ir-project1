<title>UNITED NATIONS: UN says Iraq oil deal overseers to return to NY.</title>
<headline>UN says Iraq oil deal overseers to return to NY.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Oil experts charged with reviewing all oil contracts signed under the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal will return to New York early next week, U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said Friday.</p>
<p>Foa noted the return of the experts, or overseers, does not signal a precise time for the start of oil sales under the May 20 accord, but certainly indicated the moment was closer.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still iffy on the timing,&quot; Foa said, refusing to confirm that final clearance will be given for teh oil sales on Monday.  </p>
<p>&quot;This doesn't say when the secretary general will be able to send in his final report. But, obviously we are getting closer to the magic moment for the implementation of 986, we just can't pinpoint with any accuracy whatsoever when he'll be able to transmit his final report to the security council,&quot; Foa said.</p>
<p>The United Nations was still waiting for a report from Dutch-firm Saybolt on the operational status of key oil metering equipment at the Zakho station along the Turkey-Iraq border, before giving clearance for oil sales.</p>
<p>Foa said the Saybolt report was expected sometime later Friday.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali must issue his own report to the Security Council to trigger the start of the oil deal. The aid plan would start at one minute past midnight New York time (0500 GMT) the day following Boutros-Ghali's clearance.</p>
<p>Senior U.N. officials said earlier Friday that Boutros-Ghali would report on Monday, but the secretary general refused to confirm the timing.</p>
<p>Foa noted the overseers have up to 24 hours to review all oil contracts, placing in doubt Iraqi claims oil could flow as soon as Tuesday.</p>
<p>Under the oil deal, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion worth of crude over a six-month period in order to buy food and aid for civilians, suffering from sanctions imposed on Baghdad after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.</p>
