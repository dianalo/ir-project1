<p>A Michael Jackson concert tour of Germany will go ahead even though the U.S. pop star's concert agent in the country has been arrested on suspicion of tax evasion, organisers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Marcel Avram, Jackson's agent who also counts pop singers Tina Turner and Rod Stewart and opera star Jose Carreras among his friends, was arrested on Wednesday after a three-year investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;The planned Jackson concerts are not in any danger,&quot; a spokesman from Avram's agency, Mama Concerts and Rau, said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors declined to give details of charges against Avram, but German media reports said he was accused of evading tax totalling eight million marks ($4.8 million).</p>
<p>Mama Concerts said the charges were connected with the agency's links to foreign artists.</p>
<p>Avram's celebrity lawyer, Franz Salditt, who also defended Steffi Graf's father in a tax evasion case, said the millionaire would do all he could to refute the charges.</p>
<p>Mama Concerts said authorities evidently disputed whether foreign artists should have to pay taxes on proceeds from concerts in Germany.</p>
<p>Jackson is due to start his tour of Germany in May.</p>
<p>The latest controversy came one year after Jackson pulled out of German tour dates because the Bonn government decided to tax entertainers who live abroad on all their income earned in Germany and not allow them to offset their production costs.</p>
<p>The rule increased the tax bite on foreign artists to at least 25 percent of revenue from 15 percent previously. It would have hit stars like Jackson, whose extravagant shows cost millions to produce and transport around the world.</p>
<p>A public outcry over Jackson's cancellation prompted Bonn to amend the law so that foreigners could choose whether to pay a flat 25 percent tax on their income or file a normal tax return as their German counterparts do.</p>
<p>Jackson, whose &quot;Thriller&quot; album leads the world's all-time bestsellers, is hugely popular in Germany. His appearance on a television show in 1995 made it one of the most watched programmes in German history. ($ = 1.672 German Marks)</p>
