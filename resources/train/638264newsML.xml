<p>Brunswick Corp. stuffed yet another company into its bulging gym bag Wednesday, agreeing to buy exercise equipment maker Life Fitness for about $310 million.</p>
<p>Life Fitness, based in Franklin Park, Ill., makes fitness equipment, including the Lifecycle -- the benchmark among stationary bicycles used in fitness clubs and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The seller was a private equity fund managed by Mancuso &amp; Co., a New York merchant banking firm.</p>
<p>&quot;Life Fitness fits perfectly with the strategy Brunswick is executing,&quot; Chairman Peter Larson said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We have targeted the active recreation segment due to favourable demographic and consumer trends, such as baby boomers remaining more active as they move into their 50's with more spendable income and the emphasis on wellness, active lifestyles and social interaction,&quot; Larson said.</p>
<p>Wall Street reaction to the deal was initially favourable, with Brunswick shares up 12.5 cents to 30.25 per share in early New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like it could be a good acquisition,&quot; said one recreational equipment industry analyst.</p>
<p>The recreational products maker, based in Lake Forest, Ill., is best known for its Brunswick bowling equipment and family entertainment centres, and Brunswick billiard tables.</p>
<p>Brunswick also makes Zebco and Quantum fishing rods and reels, American Camper and Remington camping gear and Igloo coolers and ice chests. Other products include Mongoose, Roadmaster and Ride Hard bicycles; powerboats sold under the Sea Ray, Bayliner, Maxum, Baja, Boston Whaler and Trophy names; and Mercury, Mariner and MerCruiser marine engines.</p>
<p>Beside the Lifecycle, Life Fitness, with annual sales of about $180 million, also markets treadmills, stairclimbers, rowers, cross trainers and strength training equipment to fitness centres worldwide.</p>
<p>The deal is scheduled to close in July. The business will continue to be run by current management, Brunswick said.</p>
