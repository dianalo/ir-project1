<p>Brent CFDs saw June 11-13 move out to -95 cents under August Brent from -93 cents while June 16-20 pulled back to -73 cents under August compared with -77 cents under on Tuesday. June 23-27 was a couple of cents stronger at -64 cents and June 30-July 4 was also firmer by three cents or so at -54 cents against August.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel held steady with June at $85.50 and July still backwardated by 50 cents or so. Nothing was heard done on the swaps, but $86 and $86.25 were wet deals.</p>
<p>Gasoline was unchanged around $188.50 for June while July was pegged around $183. Naphtha was very slow with June at $179-180.50 with July at $178-179, about $1 weaker.</p>
<p>Gas oil crack spreads were steady with 4Q97 at $4.53, 1Q98 at $4.55 and 2Q98 marginally stronger at $4.05.</p>
