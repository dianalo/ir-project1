<p>Liverpool winger Mark Kennedy scored two late goals as Ireland under-21's beat their counterparts from Macedonia 4-0 (half-time 1-0) in a European Championship qualifier at Dalymount Park on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who won his 10th senior cap against Bolivia in June, scored his first goal in the 86th minute when he tapped into an empty net after the Macedonian goalkeeper Aleksandar Ristevski had parried a shot from midfielder Keith O'Halloran.  </p>
<p>He completed the scoring in the 91st minute, to the delight of those in the crowd of 1,500 spectators, when he picked up a loose ball outside the penalty area, took the ball on before he rounded the opposing goalkeeper and slotted the ball home.</p>
<p>Ireland had opened the scoring in the 33rd minute when striker Dominic Foley, standing almost on the goal-line, headed home at the far post after defender Ross Darcy had flicked on a cross from Kennedy out on the left wing.  </p>
<p>Stephen Carr, who played as an attacking full-back in Ireland's 3-5-2 formation, made it 2-0 in the 73rd minute when he shot home from 10 yards after a header by substitute striker Glen Crowe had come back into play off a post.</p>
<p>Ireland went into Tuesday's game with a record of eight wins and 14 draws from 51 under-21 internationals.</p>
