<p>The United States expressed concern on Tuesday about what it called Peru's harassment of Israeli-born television station owner Baruch Ivcher and said the case raises fundamental questions of press freedoms.</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Ivcher is &quot;being harassed and threatened with criminal prosecution for his television station's reporting and commentary about Peruvian government officials and the Peruvian military.&quot;</p>
<p>The Peruvian government on Sunday decided to revoke Ivcher's nationality on grounds of bureaucratic &quot;irregularities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is an issue of concern to us ... These actions raise fundamental questions of freedom of the press, and freedom of expression,&quot; Burns told reporters, noting that &quot;the need to respect freedom of expression and of the press is an essential element of democracy and ... American foreign policy.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, however, that &quot;if there are any credible criminal or civil charges to be brought against Mr. Ivcher, we expect they will be resolved in fair and open and quick court proceedings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're saying that nothing should be done in a back room. If the Peruvian government believes that he's violated Peruvian law, they ought to say so ... But they (government officials) seem to be operating differently.&quot;</p>
<p>The threat to revoke Ivcher's citizenship has sparked a wave of media and public outrage and become a rallying point for Peru's increasingly buoyant opposition.</p>
