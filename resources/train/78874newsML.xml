<headline>Durable goods orders tumble, jobless claims surge.</headline>

<p>Orders for costly manufactured goods plunged in August while new applications for jobless pay surged last week, the government reported on Thursday, in fresh signs of a slowing economy.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods fell a surprisingly steep 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $167 billion last month.</p>
<p>It was the biggest monthly drop in demand for expensive and long-lasting products like new cars, computers and appliances since a 3.4 percent plunge in April l995 and followed a downward revised 1.4 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>Separately, the Labour Department said the number of people filing their first claims for jobless pay jumped by 11,000 last week to 340,000. The surge was unexpected since analysts had predicted that tight labour markets meant hiring was so brisk that fewer people needed unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>The reports were seen as a sign the industrial sector was having difficulty holding onto recent gains, as well as confirmation that the Federal Reserve correctly assessed the economy as slowing on its own when it decided not to raise interest rates this week.</p>
<p>&quot;It clearly shows that the economy is losing momentum, and that growth in the third quarter is going to come in only a fraction of what it was in the second quarter, and that the Federal Reserve was clearly right in refraining from raising interest rates the other day,&quot; said Irwin Keller, chief economist at Chase Regional Bank in New York.</p>
<p>The news bolstered a downward trend in interest rates as the inflation-sensitive 30-year Treasury bond jumped 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face value, and its yield fell to 6.89 percent from 6.93 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said July durables orders had risen by 1.7 percent, but it revised that gain downward.</p>
<p>The only type of manufactured goods for which orders increased last month was defence goods, which rose 9 percent to $5.2 billion after a 40.9 percent fall in July.</p>
<p>Excluding defence, durables orders were down even more sharply, by 3.5 percent in August, the largest decrease since a 3.6 percent fall more than two years ago, in July 1993. The decline followed a 3.5 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>The national economy expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate during the second quarter, its strongest growth in two years, which contributed to fears that pressure on wages were rising.</p>
<p>But Federal Reserve policy-makers who met Tuesday evidently foresaw the economy slowing enough in the second half to thwart inflationary risks when they decided to keep interest rates steady.</p>
<p>Robert Dederick, economic consultant to Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said the weakening durable goods orders &quot;certainly makes the Fed decision look reasonable.&quot; He stressed there was no indication of a precipitous fall in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Weak foreign economies are providing a soft market for U.S.-made goods and consumers have curbed their retail buying, but both could bounce back, Dederick said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're moving higher on a trend basis but at a moderate pace as export demand is restrained and there's a reluctance to build inventories voluntarily,&quot; he added, noting that retail sales virtually stalled in July and August.</p>
<p>The biggest single drop in durables orders during August was for transportation goods, which fell 7.9 percent to $37.9 billion, a third straight monthly decrease after drops of 1.6 percent in July and 1.3 percent in June.</p>
<p>Weaker demand for new commercial aircraft and parts accounted for more than half the falloff in transportation goods. But new-car orders also were lower than in July.</p>
<p>Orders for primary metals were down 2.7 percent in August to $15.4 billion after a 1.6 percent July increase. Industrial machinery and equipment orders declined 0.7 percent to $32.4 billion following a 3 percent July rise.</p>
<p>Orders for electronic equipment fell 5.6 percent to $26.5 billion last month after gaining 4.9 percent in July.</p>
<p>Non-defence capital goods orders, an indicator of businesses' investment in new equipment, plummeted 10.1 percent in August after a 7.2 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>Shipments of durable goods, which measure current demand in manufacturing industries, rose 0.3 percent in August to $168.2 billion after a 0.5 percent increase in July.</p>
