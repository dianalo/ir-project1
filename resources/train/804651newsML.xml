<p>Iran's defence minister designate said he would strengthen the armed forces if confirmed in the post, the official news agency IRNA reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, nominated by President Mohammad Khatami on Tuesday, told IRNA his priorities would include restructuring the defence ministry.</p>
<p>He said he would try to introduce sophisticated technology in defence-related industries, renovate and modernise domestic arms manufacturing and emphasise defence exports.</p>
<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is also commander-in-chief, in 1989 appointed former Revolutionary Guard Minister Shamkhani as commander of the navy, giving him the rank of rear admiral.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Iran's Majlis, or parliament, will start debating Shamkhani's nomination and those of the other 21 proposed ministers in Khatami's cabinet.</p>
<p>The United States accuses Iran of sponsoring international &quot;terrorism&quot; -- a charge Iran denies -- and has expressed concern since the 1991 Gulf War about what it describes as Iran's growing military capability and its aims in the region.</p>
<p>Iran opposes the U.S. military presence in the Gulf and says Washington falsely accuses it of threatening regional security in order to scare its Gulf Arab allies into buying more weapons.</p>
<p>Iran's Gulf neighbours are deeply suspicious of its arms programme and accuse it of interfering in their internal affairs.</p>
