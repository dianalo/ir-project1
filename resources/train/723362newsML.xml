<p>Falcon Drilling Co Inc and Reading &amp; Bates Corp said on Thursday that the boards of both companies approved a definitive agreement for a $5 billion merger.</p>
<p>The deal will create a new company, R&amp;B Falcon Corp, a news release issued by the comanies said.  </p>
<p>Falcon Drilling shareholders are to get one share of R&amp;B Falcon Corp common stock for each share of Falcon Drilling common stock, the news release said.</p>
<p>Reading &amp; Bates shareholders will get 0.59 shares of R&amp;B Falcon common stock, which exchange ratio will be adjusted to 1.18 to give effect to the previously announced Falcon Drilling stock split, for each share of Reading &amp; Bates common stock, the release said.</p>
<p>The exchange of shares for both companies is expected to be tax free and the companies will seek pooling of interests accounting treatment, the release said.  </p>
<p>Reading &amp; Bates President, Chairman and Chief Executive Paul Loyd will be chairman of the new company, the news release said.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 1997, the companies said.</p>
<p>The new company will have a fleet of 14 vessels capable of drilling in water deeper than 3,000 feet, the companies said.  </p>
<p>Steven Webster, chairman and chief executive of Falcon Drilling, will be the president and chief executive officer of the new company, the news release said.</p>
<p>The new company's 10-member board will be made up of five members appointed by Falcon Drilling and five appointed by Reading &amp; Bates, the release said.  </p>
<p>Webster called the combination a &quot;significant consolidation opportunity in the fast growing, highest margin segment of the drilling industry - deepwater.&quot;</p>
<p>Loyd said he expects to see the benefits of the transaction &quot;almost immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Given that Steve and I have known each other and worked together for over 25 years and that we do not expect any significant layoffs at the operating level, I am confident of our ability to achieve a seamless and rapid integration of our operations,&quot; Loyd said.  </p>
<p>Falcon Drilling provides offshore drilling services for the international oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>Falcon's fleet of 82 drilling units services the international deepwater, the offshore Gulf of Mexico and the worldwide transition zone.</p>
<p>Reading &amp; Bates provides offshore drilling services throughout the world. Its Reading &amp; Bates Development Co unit is in the business of acquiring interests in offshore oil and gas properties and thereby participates in reservoir risk sharing.</p>
