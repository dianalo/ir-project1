<p>Precious metals prices were mixed on Friday afternoon after they had consolidated and corrected higher overnight, dealers said.</p>
<p>U.S. economic data -- the Producer Price Index -- released at 1230 GMT showed the Federal Reserve Bank still had inflation well under control and that helped the dollar briefly to its highest level in six years against the mark while putting presure on gold.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $319.50 per ounce, down from $320.60 at the morning fixing and $319.80 on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Comex August contract was unchanged at $320.80 shortly after the fixing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing some consolidation but the overall bear trend has some way to run,&quot; one market analyst said.</p>
<p>After the Reserve Bank of Australia last Thursday announced it had sold 167 tonnes of gold from its reserves over the previous six months, gold prices slumped to their lowest level in almost 12 years.</p>
<p>However the rush to sell was overdone and the price edged higher as short position holders covered and took profits.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold is oversold on the charts and having bounced off support at $315.00 this week, may even stage a short covering rally in the coming days,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>However a combination of a strong dollar and anxious producers selling forward to avoid even lower prices was likely to cap any rally at around $322.00, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold consumers were being extremely cautious about buying even at the current low prices on the assumption that even lower prices were to come.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for demand to come back. It has been weak due to the seasonal trend and the fabricators looking for lower prices,&quot; a market analyst said.</p>
<p>The threat of another central bank sale would keep the market on the back foot, although almost inevitably the volume of gold actually sold would be easily absorbed, he said.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were mixed after slumping in the latter case to a two month low on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the decline from highs seen in June had been overdone and now that Russia had resumed exports for the first time this year, some consolidation followed by lower prices was likely.</p>
<p>Platinum was up $9.00 at $405.00/$409.00 but palladium was up $4.50 at $166.50/$170.50 and silver was four cents up at $4.37/$4.39. --Brian Spoors London Newsroom +44 171 542 8058</p>
