<p>A bomb went off on a train between Moscow and St Petersburg on Friday, killing three people and wounding seven, an emergencies ministry official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a bomb which was hidden in the toilets of one of the carriages,&quot; a duty officer told Reuters, He said the incident happened at around 6:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).</p>
<p>Another official said train number 24, heading for St Petersburg, was near Torbino station in the Novgorod region northwest of Moscow when the blast occurred.</p>
<p>&quot;After a short delay, traffic on the line resumed,&quot; another emergencies ministry official said by telephone.</p>
<p>NTV commercial television said later that the damaged carriage had been uncoupled and the rest of the train had arrived in St Petersburg with the injured on board.</p>
<p>A local television reporter at the Moskovsky station in St Petersburg said by telephone that the station had been sealed off by police.</p>
<p>Railways Minister Nikolai Aksenenko was among officials and security police who headed for the site of the crash, NTV said.</p>
<p>The emergencies ministry officials said they had no indication yet as to who might have planted the bomb.</p>
<p>Bomb blasts are a fairly common occurrence in Russia, where explosives are often used in contract killings of businessmen.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, four people were killed when blasts ripped through two stations in southern Russia.</p>
<p>Moscow blamed those explosions on Chechen rebels, but separatist leaders in the southern republic, torn by a 21-month conflict with Russian troops which ended last August, denied any involvement.</p>
