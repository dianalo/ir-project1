<p>Indonesian kaolin miner PT Alter Abadi was traded actively after its debut on Thursday and topping the active list during morning session, brokers said.</p>
<p>After opening at 950 rupiah, the new stock peaked at 1,000 rupiah before easing back to 975 rupiah by the lunchbreak with 31 million shares changing hands, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was quite a relief that it was finally listed today because previously we had heard talk that the Capital Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam) might suspend the listing,&quot; a local broker said.</p>
<p>Brokers said buying interest from PT Makindo, who is also the underwriter of the issue, seemed quite strong and it might have helped limit the downside.</p>
<p>They said the talk of possible suspension on the listing was due to recent media reports that National Kaolin Association had asked Bapepam to re-check all information contained in the prospectus.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Bisnis Indonesia daily quoted Bapepam chairman I Putu Gede Ary Suta as saying the body had checked all the information in the prospectus before giving it permission to list on the Jakarta Stock Exchange few months ago.</p>
<p>Alter Abadi listed 398,250,000 shares on the Jakarta bourse, offering 88,919,000 shares to public at 900 rupiah last month.</p>
<p>The firm said in its prospectus proceeds from the sale of 62,574,500 shares would be given to the privately-owned PT Hakim Perkasa Interniaga as a founder shareholder.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the remaining 26,344,500 shares would be used to repay company's temporary loan to PT Hakim Perkasa Interniaga.</p>
