<p>Ponting was 56 not out as Tasmania reached 99 for three at lunch. Tasmania captain David Boon was 11 not out.</p>
<p>Queensland's pace bowlers tore through Tasmania's top order early in the first session for the home side to be struggling at 31 for three. Michael Kasprowicz removed opener Jamie Cox and number three Michael DiVenuto while Adam Dale accounted for opener Dene Hills.</p>
<p>Boon had earlier won the toss and chose to bat.</p>
