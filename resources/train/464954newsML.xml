<p>Fourteen people were killed and about 20 injured when a train smashed into a packed city bus at a railway crossing in South Korea on Monday, a police official said.</p>
<p>The passenger train bound for Seoul struck the rear of the bus as it crossed the tracks in the southwestern city of Namwon, the local police official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The collision took place at around 9.00 a.m. (0000 GMT). The city bus was full as it was market day in Namwon,&quot; he said by telephone.</p>
<p>Some of the injured were in critical condition, the official said, adding there were no casualties reported on the train and no foreigners were involved.</p>
<p>The back of the bus was mangled by the force of the impact, which flipped the vehicle onto its side, the official said.</p>
<p>There are no gates at the crossing, where a siren indicates an approaching train, he said.</p>
