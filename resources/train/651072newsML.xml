<p>Philippe Seguin became parliamentary floor leader of France's Gaullist RPR party on Tuesday, a key step in his bid to seize the party presidency from ex-premier Alain Juppe after last week's election defeat.</p>
<p>Seguin, the former National Assembly speaker, was the sole candidate for the job despite divisions and bickering within the Rally for the Republic (RPR) over the unexpected electoral debacle.</p>
<p>&quot;A renovated, reconciled and open movement is now at hand,&quot; he told reporters after fellow parliamentarians elected him.</p>
<p>Seguin, who took over as the right's campaign leader after Juppe took the blame for the centre-right's defeat in the first round of voting, has made a formal bid for the leadership of the party founded by President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>The RPR leadership is to meet on Wednesday to set the date for an emergency congress to name the party president.</p>
<p>Juppe, who is under intense pressure to quit, has not said whether he will stand for re-election.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Francois Bayrou, who was education minister in Juppe's government, was unanimously elected floor leader of the centrist UDF.</p>
<p>The Communists, who now count 38 members of parliament compared to 24 before the vote 10 days ago, re-elected Alain Bocquet, who had been the party's floor leader since 1993.</p>
<p>Communist party leader Robert Hue, who won his first parliamentary seat in the election, did not stand for the floor leadership position.</p>
