<title>UK: FORECAST-GA expected to report profit fall.</title>

<p>Scottish-based composite insurer General Accident Plc (GA) reports 1996 results on Tuesday, with weather-related losses and difficult trading conditions in non-life markets expected to see profits decline from 1995's record levels.</p>
<p>GA will be the third of Britain's large composites to report following figures from Commercial Union Plc and Guardian Royal Exchange Plc earlier this week.</p>
<p>Both saw profits fall over the year and the market expects a similar performance from GA.</p>
<p>Consensus forecasts are for operating profits of around 388 million stg, a drop of 48 million stg. The dividend for the year is forecast to rise just over six percent to 33 pence per share.</p>
<p>This year's results will include a full year contribution from life assurer Provident Mutual, bought for 170 million stg at the beginning of 1996 and which doubled the group's share of the UK pension market.</p>
<p>&quot;GA has a very strong life business and I think we'll seen more evidence of the successful consolidation of Provident Mutual,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>At the nine month stage, GA reported a 40 million stg fall in operating profits from the previous year to 311 million stg.</p>
<p>The results were broadly in-line with the slightly worse than expected non-life underwriting result offset by better than expected life results and investment income.</p>
<p>Weather-related losses caused by severe weather in Europe and North America amounted to 58 million stg.</p>
<p>That theme has been repeated in results from composites Commercial Union (CU) and Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE) which reported earlier this week.</p>
<p>Both also blamed stiff competition, particularly in the UK general insurance market, for sharp falls in profits over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>While GA chief executive Bob Scott described the trading environment in the UK at the end of the third quarter as &quot;increasingly competitive&quot; he also said at the time that he was &quot;quietly confident&quot; about prospects for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Non-life underwriting results are turning down but if anything has come out this week it is that perhaps the downturn hasn't been as bad as we expected and in particular some rates do seem to be turning up in the UK market,&quot; said an analyst.</p>
<p>Both GRE and CU said earlier in the week that they expected motor rates to firm through 1997 and household rates to stabilise or edge slightly higher.</p>
<p>Back in January GA said it planned to double new premium income from sales of life assurance, pensions and investment products in the next three years.</p>
<p>It said organic growth would be the mainstay in achieving this but the company did not rule out the possibility of an acquisition.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the first half it hinted it was unlikely to seek a large acquisition in its home market and said there was &quot;nothing wrong with organic growth&quot;.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, CU chief executive John Carter was also quick to play down speculation about further consolidation in the industry.</p>
<p>He said that &quot;acquisitions at the top of a bull market don't always prove to be the most timely and value-creating deals&quot;.</p>
<p>GA has been similarly dismissive about such rumours which have seen it linked with both CU Germany's Allianz  AVVG.F in the recent past.</p>
<p>At the end of the third quarter GA denied it was being left on the sidelines by mergers in the sector, arguing big was not always beautiful and smaller companies could be very cost effective.</p>
<p>It has also been looking to sell several small non-core businesses as part of efforts to focus resources on markets where it had &quot;advantages of scale and synergy&quot;.</p>
<p>The currency hit which wiped 64 million stg off CU's profit in 1996 is likely to have less of an impact with GA's exposure to the currencies that have fallen the most against sterling less than that of CU.</p>
