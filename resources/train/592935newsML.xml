<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam's son, Kim Hyun-chul, was arrested on Saturday, live television pictures showed.  </p>
<p>The younger Kim, looking grim-faced and tired, was led out of the Supreme Public Prosecutors' Office in Seoul by prosecution officials and hustled into a waiting car to be taken to the Seoul Detention House.</p>
<p>A prosecution official said the arrest took effect as soon as he left the building at around 7.30 p.m. (1030 GMT). A crowd of news reporters jostled him as he emerged and chased his grey vehicle as it sped away.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun-chul was arrested on charges of accepting bribes of 3.2 billion won ($3.6 million) in return for favours and of evading taxes.</p>
<p>He was summoned by prosecutors on Thursday evening. Although he confessed to taking money during marathon interrogation sessions he insisted the cash did not represent kickbacks.</p>
