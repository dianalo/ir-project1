<title>JAPAN: TOCOM gold slips, platinum group metals stronger.</title>
<headline>TOCOM gold slips, platinum group metals stronger.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures settled lower across the board, battered by the yen's steep gains against the dollar, traders said, while platinum group metals led by palladium reversed early losses to end higher.</p>
<p>Activity was buoyant due to the volatile currency market.</p>
<p>Stronger spot prices in the platinum group metals reflected very tight spot supplies amid a lack of Russian sales, which prompted private investors to cover shorts, the traders said.</p>
<p>May and August palladium futures were up the 24 yen per gram daily limit at the close. Benchmark April palladium ended up 20 yen at 611 yen.  </p>
<p>&quot;Private investors were covering their short positions in platinum group metals, taking advantage of price dips following the yen's steep gains,&quot; an analyst at a commodity broker said.</p>
<p>Traders estimated private investors held about 50 tonnes of short positions in palladium futures as of late last week.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from 21 yen to 42 yen per gram lower. Benchmark April gold was down 26 yen at 1,334 yen.</p>
<p>Spot gold extended Friday's New York gains as the U.S. dollar continued sliding. Gold was quoted at $348.50/349.00 per ounce at 0724 GMT, against $347.80/30 at the New York close.</p>
<p>The dollar slipped below 118 yen in early Tokyo trade.  </p>
<p>In gold futures, losses were partly offset by bargain-hunting by private investors, while trade houses bought spot gold in arbitrage dealings for most of the day.</p>
<p>One trader said gold is likely to target $350 per ounce, lifted by the dollar's fall and strong platinum group metal prices.</p>
<p>Platinum futures ranged from two yen per gram lower to 16 yen higher, with benchmark April down one yen at 1,456 yen. Benchmark April silver was down 3.5 yen per 10 grams at 189.5 yen.</p>
