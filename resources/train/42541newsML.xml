<p>Hundreds of Iraqi Kurds returned from the Iranian border on Tuesday to the homes they had fled, apparently reassured that troops of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were not moving in, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are hundreds of vehicles and perhaps thousands of people&quot; returning from the Iranian border, said Stafford Clarry, head of the U.N. relief effort in Sulaimaniya, a city overrun by a Baghdad-backed Kurdish militia on Monday.</p>
<p>Witnesses said many hundreds of Iraqi Kurds had returned in vehicles piled high with belongings. Senior U.N. officials said refugees turned around and headed for home after finding Iran's border closed.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which conquered Sulaimaniya, issued a statement offering its rivals an amnesty.</p>
<p>&quot;If the border remains closed, if the city remains quiet, then they'll come flocking back,&quot; said a senior U.N. official.</p>
<p>Abdullah Mohammed, 45, who makes videocassettes for a living, returned with his wife and seven children on Tuesday, two days after they left, and said: &quot;I left because of Saddam, but Saddam is not there. Just Mr Barzani. He is Kurdish, it's no problem, I'll go home.&quot;</p>
<p>In Sulaimaniya, life was slowly beginning to return to normal, with civilians walking in the streets and a few shops opening their doors again.</p>
<p>There was no shooting in the city, although groups of KDP peshmerga guerrillas were still touring the streets, celebrating their victory.</p>
<p>The KDP, backed by Saddam, completed a successful 10-day assault on Monday by taking Sulaimaniya, the last bastion of the PUK in northern Iraq. The campaign began on August 31 with the taking of the Iraqi Kurdish capital, Arbil.</p>
<p>The United States launched cruise missile attacks on Iraqi targets twice last week in reaction to Saddam's involvement.</p>
