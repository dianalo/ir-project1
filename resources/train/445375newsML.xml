<p>China go into the world badminton championships in May with high hopes after winning four of the five All England titles, but fans will not want a repeat of Saturday's women's final.</p>
<p>Gong Zhichao, seeded two and seen in some circles as a potential new star, bowed out in just 19 minutes, beaten 11-1 11-3 by Ye Zhaoying, the world champion but seeded only joint third here after a disappointing spell in 1996.</p>
<p>Gong, 19, had put out the great Susi Susanti earlier in the week and looked a highly capable performer but on Saturday afternoon her form totally deserted her.</p>
<p>Ye was untroubled as Gong constantly hit too long or too wide in what proved an embarrassingly one-sided affair and a big disappointment for the 5,500 crowd, not to mention a sizeable television audience.</p>
<p>At a news conference later, Gong could offer no explanation, such as injury, nerves or indisposition, for the display, remarking merely that it was &quot;hard to say&quot; why her form had dipped so badly on the big day.</p>
<p>Ye might sympathise. She won the world title in 1995 but 12 months ago in the women's final here she was on the receiving end of an even bigger humiliation, beaten 11-1 11-1 by the now retired Bang Soo-hyun of South Korea.</p>
<p>At least she has exorcised that particular ghost and can look forward with confidence to retaining her title at the world championships, being held this year in Glasgow.</p>
<p>Whatever the disappointment for the fans on Saturday, it was virtually guaranteed to be China's day from the outset.</p>
<p>For the first time in the tournament's 87-year history both sets of finalists in the singles events were Chinese and the icing was laid firmly on the cake when they also took the women's doubles and the mixed doubles titles to record their best ever All England achievement.</p>
<p>In the men's singles Dong Jiong, Olympic silver medallist, brushed aside Chinese compatriot Sun Jun 15-9 15-5.</p>
<p>Dong had gained revenge late on Friday on Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, the Dane who took the Olympic gold last year.</p>
<p>Sun Jun, a former world junior champion, had claimed his final place with an excellent win over world champion Heryanto Arbi of Indonesia.</p>
<p>But again, the final was another lacklustre affair, certainly when compared to the previous night's action.</p>
<p>Both men's finalists turned up for interviews in the press room after Saturday's final but when an official, acting as an interpreter, realised a Malaysian television crew was present the Chinese left, saying the players must change out of their playing kit but apparently amid some political sensitivities.</p>
<p>They did not return.</p>
<p>China's most successful player on the day was the highly efficient Ge Fei. She and Gu Jun beat Eliza and Resiana Zelin of Indonesia 15-6 15-9 to retain their women's doubles crown then Ge teamed up with Liu Yong in the mixed to overcome top seeds Trikus Heryanto and Minarti Timur of Indonesia 15-10 15-2.</p>
<p>The only title not to go to the Chinese was the men's doubles. South Koreans Ha Tae-kwon and Kang Kyung-jin beat Jon Holst-Christensen and Michael Sogaard of Denmark 15-11 17-16 in what was easily the best match of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Ahead of the world championships, Asia's other big power-house of the sport, Indonesia, will be licking their wounds with the defeat in earlier rounds of such as Arbi, Susanti, 17-year-old Mia Audina, the top seed in the women's singles, and Olympic and world men's doubles champions Rexy Mainaky and Ricky Subagja.</p>
<p>But watch them roar back in Glasgow.</p>
