<p>The international medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors without Frontiers) called on Thursday for action to save 200 Palestinians stranded in appalling conditions on the Libyan-Egyptian border for the past year.</p>
<p>The Palestinians, largely forgotten by the rest of the world, have been living in what MSF called an open-air prison in no man's land between the Libyan and Egyptian border posts.</p>
<p>They were among the thousands of Palestinians expelled by Libya last year in an attempt to show the world that Palestinian self-rule offered nothing to Palestinians in exile.</p>
<p>Most of the deportees went on to other countries but Egypt has refused to let in those without proof that they can leave the country by another border. Israel controls access to the autonomous West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>MSF said: &quot;The Palestinians live in grinding conditions characterised by a lack of water, deplorable hygiene and physical and mental exhaustion.</p>
<p>&quot;Packed in tents and surrounded by heaps of garbage, scorpions and ferocious wild dogs, infections and insect bites occur very frequently.&quot;</p>
<p>They have no medical service and the children among them face the prospect of a second year out of school.</p>
<p>&quot;MSF makes an appeal to the authorities concerned, as well as to the United Nations, to take concrete action, so that the refugees can leave this hideous place and can go back to humane living conditions,&quot; the charity said.</p>
