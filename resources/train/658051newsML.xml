<p>The possibility of prolonged delays in shipments of copper concentrates from the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea to smelters in Asia and Europe is helping shore up spot concentrate prices, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spot prices in recent weeks have been heading more in favor of miners and are currently set at about US$100 a tonne, plus a refining charge of around 10 U.S. cents per pound of actual copper, the traders said.</p>
<p>This compares with long-term, or &quot;frame&quot; prices closer to $105 a tonne plus a 10.5 cents refining charge, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is an expectation that it should tighten up a bit further if Ok Tedi's problems persist,&quot; one metals trader said.</p>
<p>The higher the charges the less miners are paid for concentrates.</p>
<p>Shipments of concentrates from Ok Tedi have been halted due to a lack of water on the Fly River, which has made barge transport impossible.</p>
<p>Concentrates normally stacked up in floating silos have been exhausted and the mine has started cutting back operations.</p>
<p>Ok Tedi normally ships about 50,000 tonnes a month, much of which finds its way to Asia and Europe.  </p>
<p>At least one smelting company, Japan's Nippon Mining and Metals Co, has had its June delivery from Ok Tedi delayed.</p>
<p>A Nippon Mining official told Reuters in Tokyo that representives from the Ok Tedi informed the company that they had not been able to meet a June deliver yet.</p>
<p>They said they could deliver the concentrates by the end of June, but only if it rains now, the official said.</p>
<p>As a result of the drought, the mine has started to reduce mill throughput and has asked some employees to use up accrued leave time until the rains come.  </p>
<p>&quot;OK Tedi has had an effect on prices simply because there has been fairly tight metals stocks and consumption has been stronger than everyone expected,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Despite some forecasts that the copper market is headed for a surplus, traders have complained that there is little spot concentrate available to sell on world markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly in our neck of the woods, there doesn't seem to be a lot around,&quot; a trader in Sydney said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mines in Australia might retain only about five to 10 percent of their total output for the spot market -- and that might end up predominatly in China or perhaps India,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The bulk of the world's spot material tends to originate from the vast copper mines of South America.</p>
<p>Central Africa is also emerging as an important source for spot material due to domestic smelting and refining problems associated with countries in the region, another trader said.</p>
