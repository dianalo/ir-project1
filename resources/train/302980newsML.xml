<title>USA: Improved aviation safety needed for industry growth.</title>
<headline>Improved aviation safety needed for industry growth.</headline>

<p>A senior Boeing Co. official said on Monday that growth in the aviation industry could come to a halt if air safety was not improved.</p>
<p>Charles Higgins, vice president for safety of Boeing's commercial airplane group, told an aviation safety conference that if the current air traffic growth rate and current accident rate continued, there would likely be an accident somewhere in the world every week by the year 2005.</p>
<p>Higgins said that even if global safety improved to the U.S. level, there would be an accident every two weeks.</p>
<p>Data suggested that air travel drops off after major accidents, and with a major accident every week or two, &quot;public confidence could erode to the point where growth in the industry might stop,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Higgins added that &quot;it is in the aviation industry's best interest to take action now to improve the level of safety.&quot;</p>
<p>The three-day conference was sponsored by George Washington University and the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security, formed after the crash of Trans World Airlines Inc. Flight 800 last summer, killing all 230 people on board.</p>
<p>Higgins said industry and government cooperation was needed to improve safety in areas that included aircraft maintenance, personnel training and air traffic control, and that efforts had to made internationally.</p>
<p>He said two-thirds of all fatal accidents in the last five years had been associated with loss of control in flight, such as unexpected and unusual weather, and controlled flight into terrain, including airport approach and landing.</p>
<p>Industry officials said pilot training was being stepped up on how to react to unexpected and ususual events and planes were being fitted with equipment to warn pilots of approaching terrain, sometimes unseen because of weather or unexpected due to faulty instrument information.</p>
<p>Carol Hallett, president of the U.S. Air Transport Association, said global safety efforts were needed to end the duplication of regulations and the cultural and legal differences that hold back safety efforts.</p>
<p>She said a flight from New York to Frankfurt will travel through a half-dozen regulating jurisdictions and encounter numerous languages, measurements and environmental restrictions and procedures while en route.</p>
<p>&quot;What results,&quot; Hallett said, &quot;is a costly and inconsistent global patchwork of standards.&quot;</p>
