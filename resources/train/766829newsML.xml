<p>The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday belatedly welcomed successful elections in Liberia and called on all parties to abide by their results and cooperate in forming a new government.</p>
<p>Without mentioning the presidential election winner, former warlord Charles Taylor, the council in a statement said the new government should &quot;protect the democratic system and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms under the rule of law.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement, which had to be approved by all 15 council members, was delayed for several days in an effort to get China's endorsement. The elections were held on July 19, with results announced last Thursday.</p>
<p>Beijing had objected to plans by Taylor, who instigated Liberia's brutal civil war in 1989, to invite a high-level envoy from Taiwan to his inauguration. Liberia had ties with both Taipei and Beijing but Taylor has said he prefers Taiwan.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, his foreign minister-designate, Monie Captan, told the China Times newspaper in Taiwan that Liberia's interim government recognised Beijing in 1993 because it &quot;needed the United Nations to monitor our peace process and China is one of the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members.&quot;</p>
<p>In its statement, the council also congratulated the Liberian people &quot;on the courage and determination they have shown in proceeding with the elections under difficult cirumstances.&quot; It hoped that refugees would be allowed to return home.</p>
<p>It commended the 16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which sent in a Nigerian-led multinational force which policed Liberia. The troops disarmed guerrillas and provided security for the elections.</p>
<p>The United Nations has an observer mission, comprising 86 military officers and a seven-member medical unit.</p>
<p>Taylor is the first descendant of freed American slaves to lead the country since soldiers led by Sgt. Samuel Doe ended the 133-year, one-party rule of the True Whig Party in 1980.</p>
<p>The last Americo-Liberian president, William Tolbert, was executed in that coup along with several of his aides.</p>
<p>The October 1985 election was widely believed to have been rigged by Doe and triggered a coup attempt a month later which he crushed, leading to a ferocious seven-year civil war.</p>
