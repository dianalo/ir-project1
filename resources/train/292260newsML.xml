<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan vice-president may visit Europe - report.</title>
<headline>Taiwan vice-president may visit Europe - report.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan officials were tight-lipped on Tuesday over a newspaper report that the isolated island's Vice-President, Lien Chan, would visit Europe on the way home from an official trip to Nicaragua.</p>
<p>The United Evening News, quoting unnamed high-level officials, said Lien would fly to &quot;important&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; European nations to work on Taipei's diplomatic relationships.</p>
<p>Communist China, Taiwan's arch rival since a civil war split them in 1949, regards the island as a rebel province ineligible for foreign ties. It has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule.</p>
<p>&quot;So far we are proceeding with our original plan to visit overseas. We do not intend to change the plan,&quot; Foreign Minister John Chang said on state radio.</p>
<p>Chang declined to comment when asked whether the original plan included a visit to Europe.</p>
<p>Lien, who is also premier, is scheduled to leave for Nicaragua on Tuesday to attend the January 10 inauguration of Arnoldo Aleman as president.</p>
<p>He will stop in New York on his way home.</p>
<p>Only 30 countries, mostly poor states in Africa and central America, recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government instead of Beijing's communist Chinese government.</p>
<p>South Africa, Taiwan's biggest ally, announced in November it would sever ties with Taipei by the end of 1997 in favour of Beijing.</p>
<p>To evade China's diplomatic embargo, Taiwan officials have engaged in &quot;secret diplomacy&quot; -- unannounced visits to countries which recognise Beijing instead of Taipei.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chang and Lien have between them visited Ukraine, Singapore, Malaysia, Belgium, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan in the past year.</p>
