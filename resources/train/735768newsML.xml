<p>A Macau hotel that was recently the target of a bomb attack was at the centre of a new scare on Thursday, but police said an object thought to be a bomb turned out to be a brick.</p>
<p>A Macau government official earlier said a bomb had been tossed through a restaurant window in the New Century Hotel on the Portuguese-run enclave's Taipa island but had failed to explode.</p>
<p>However police later said what had been thrown was just a brick.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no bomb, no explosion,&quot; police spokesman Jose Cruz told a news conference, putting the brick on display.</p>
<p>He said the brick either fell or was thrown through the skylight window of the 600-room hotel's second-floor Japanese restaurant from a room in the hotel or a nearby building.</p>
<p>The China-funded hotel was recently taken over by a local consortium that planned to open a casino.</p>
<p>Recent reports have said rival triad gangs are about to renew a gangland turf war over casino-related rackets.</p>
<p>A spate of firebombings, knifings and drive-by shootings has killed at least 16 people this year in the territory, which returns to Chinese rule in 1999.</p>
<p>The gangs are fighting over shares in illegal loansharking and protection rackets linked to the legal casino business, Macau's biggest industry.</p>
<p>The number of tourists visiting Macau fell 10 percent in May, possibly as a result of violence.</p>
