<p>The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is meeting in New York with power industry traders to address several problems linked to its electricity futures complex, sources familiar with the talks said Monday.</p>
<p>The most important issue being discussed is a disparity between contract units and the over-counter-market, they said.</p>
<p>The NYMEX contracts are structured in 23-day packages, but that means all the Saturdays in a given month are not included.</p>
<p>&quot;The over-the-counter traders find that disparity to be a problem,&quot; said one Oregon trader.</p>
<p>Another market source said a contract structure of 6 days by 16 hours would be much more useful than the 5x16 now used by NYMEX.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody had this idea that five days would be better for the financial markets, but the physical and futures markets don't match up. It makes hedging a lot more difficult,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>Other issues being discussed include the fact that Palo Verde contracts are based on Mountain Time, compared with Pacific Time for the California-Oregon border (COB) contracts.</p>
<p>Since Arizona does not observe daylight savings time, the discrepancy occurs for half of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Physical traders have always gotten around that. I don't see why the futures market can't,&quot; said a trader at PacifiCorp.</p>
<p>There are also technical issues regarding delivery at COB based on whether transmissions are from the north or south, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;BPA (Bonneville Power Administration) needs to change its imbedded scheduling practices. Wholesale transmission access was supposed to eliminate the problem, but it remains to be seen,&quot; the PacifiCorp trader said.</p>
<p>He noted similar scheduling problems arise on the Pacific Gas and Electric side of the hub.</p>
<p>Market sources were also said to be concerned about inconsistencies by NYMEX in the calculation of settlement prices.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be more of a timing problem. The NYMEX locals can manipulate the settlement price to suit their books,&quot; said one trader, noting the solution to the problem is increased market liquidity.</p>
<p>NYMEX officials were not available for comment on the talks.</p>
