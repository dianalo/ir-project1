<title>USA: Republicans big donors meet leaders in Florida.</title>

<text>
<p>Top financial backers of the Republican Party met party leaders in Florida Thursday with campaign finance reform high on the agenda.</p>
<p>About 200 Republican big spenders, members of the party's exclusive &quot;Team 100,&quot; were spending three days golfing and socializing with Republican officials and congressional leaders including House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott at a posh Palm Beach resort.</p>
<p>To qualify for membership of the four-year Team 100 group, a contributor must give $100,000 to the party in the first year and $25,000 a year in each of the next three years for a total of $175,000. The group meets twice a year.</p>
<p>Attendees sounded less than enthusiastic about reforming the system of campaign funding, a topic much in the news because of revelations of Democratic Party fundraising from foreigners trying to influence the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>Campaign reform may be good for the nation &quot;but it's not going to happen,&quot; former Republican gubernatorial candidate Robin Hayes of North Carolina said. &quot;It would hurt both sides in the way they do things.&quot;</p>
<p>President Clinton Tuesday spoke at a fundraising reception for 120 contributors in New York City that raised $1.2 million for Democratic candidates for the Senate.</p>
