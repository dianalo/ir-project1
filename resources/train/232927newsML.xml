<p>Malaysia's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to be 8.2 percent in 1997 and 8.5 percent in 1998, a government-backed think-tank said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a report, the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER), said, &quot;MIER expects real GDP to grow by 8.2 percent in 1997 and 8.5 percent in 1998.&quot;  </p>
<p>MIER's report, issued as part of a two-day outlook conference, also forecast that the current account deficit as a percentage of nominal gross national product (GNP) &quot;will moderate&quot; to 4.7 percent in 1997 and 4.2 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>It said the improvement in the current account gap would be due to &quot;the expected improvement in the trade balance&quot;.</p>
<p>The inflation rate is expected to be 3.7 percent in 1997, and 3.8 percent the following year, the MIER report said.  </p>
<p>In 1995, Malaysia registered GDP growth of 9.5 percent, which is estimated by the government to fall to 8.2 percent this year.</p>
<p>Because of a larger merchandise account surplus, the current account of the balance of payments is estimated by the government to be 6.3 percent of GNP in 1996, against nine percent of GNP in 1995.</p>
<p>The government in its annual economic report said it expected the merchandise account of the balance of payments to record a larger suplus of 4.6 billion ringgit in 1996, compared with a 233 million ringgit surplus in 1995.</p>
<p>Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 3.4 percent in 1995, and is estimated by the government to be 3.6 percent in 1996.</p>
