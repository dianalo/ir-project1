<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin expects to sign a &quot;grand treaty&quot; with Ukraine on Saturday that will provide a new start after years of frosty relations, the Kremlin press service said in statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>After a two-hour briefing by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin said he was satisfied with agreements the premier signed in Kiev on Wednesday. &quot;They...lay the foundation for the conclusion of a 'grand treaty' on friendship and cooperation,&quot; the press service said.  </p>
<p>Yeltsin is scheduled to arrive in Kiev on Friday afternoon and to sign a treaty with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma on Saturday. But similar visits have been planned and cancelled six times in as many years as the two former Soviet states have struggled to resolve a variety of problems.</p>
<p>The agreements reached by Chernomyrdin, notably on leasing facilities at Ukraine's Sevastopol port for Russian ships in the former Soviet Black Sea fleet, seem to have removed the remaining obstacles to an overall bilateral treaty, however.</p>
<p>Saying Chernomyrdin's visit had paved the way for the treaty, the Kremlin said: &quot;Its text is ready for signing during the forthcoming visit of the Russian president.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;B.N. Yeltsin believes the signing of such a solid packet of documents between Russia and Ukraine should create a genuine breakthrough in their bilateral relations and give a response to many questions which have long stirred up public opinion in both countries and complicated their cooperation,&quot; the Kremlin said.</p>
