<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's personal doctor on Monday visited and examined the jailed spiritual leader of the Moslem militant Hamas movement and found him in ill health, the doctor told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We visited today Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and I checked him,&quot; said Doctor Issa Barazi after heading a three-man delegation to the infirmary of Israel's Ramleh prison.</p>
<p>&quot;He has a chronic infection of the lungs, he is completely paralyzed, he needs two prisoners to help him, his hearing is diminished, his health is deteriorating day by day and he said he cannot tolerate staying in prison.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a newspaper interview last week if the 60-year-old cleric was ill he would be released. Yassin has been paralyzed since an accident as a young man.</p>
<p>Yassin was jailed for life in 1989 on charges of founding Hamas. Hamas has led violent opposition to Israel-PLO peace deals struck since 1993. Last year it carried out a series of suicide bombings that rocked the peace process.</p>
<p>Another member of the delegation to see Yassin in prison was Hisham Abdel Razek, the chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;We want his release along with other prisoners immediately,&quot; Abdel Razek said. &quot;His staying in the prison endangers his life. We don't want good intentions from Israel, we want Israel to release the prisoners according to the agreement,&quot; he said, referring to Israel-PLO accords.</p>
<p>Abdel Razek said the prisoner release would be high on Arafat's agenda when he meets Netanyahu to discuss the implementation of the accords on Thursday. Israel holds some 5,000 Palestinian prisoners.</p>
