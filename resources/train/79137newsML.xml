<p>Indian share prices fell broadly on Thursday in jittery trade triggered by fresh worries of political uncertainty, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said sellers outnumbered buyers in sluggish trade after a court rejected an anticipatory bail request by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao against possible arrest in a criminal conspiracy case.</p>
<p>After the market closed Indian news agencies reported that federal police filed fresh charges against Rao in a seven-year old forgery case.</p>
<p>&quot;There's extreme pessimism,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index ended 36.87 points, or 1.10 percent, lower at 3,307.05 off the day's low of 3,293.71. The 50-stock National Stock Exchange (NSE) index dropped 11.98 points, or 1.23 percent, to 959.31.</p>
<p>The minority coalition government of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda depends on the support of Rao's Congress party.</p>
<p>State-owned insurance firms were the only net buyers.</p>
<p>SBI fell 5.0 rupees to 259.25 on the BSE and analysts said a further fall could mar its $400 million global depositary receipt issue which was expected to be priced at a premium to the underlying stock.  </p>
<p>IPCL fell 7.0 to 115 after its chief said he expects a net profit of 2.2 billion rupees in the first six months to September 30, 1996 against 3.05 billion in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>ACC fell 48 rupees to 1,805, TELCO 4.75 to 454.75, Reliance 3.25 to 193.75 and Bajaj Auto 4.75 to 985.25.</p>
<p>The 500-share CRISIL index shed 7.41 points to 642.22.</p>
<p>The Delhi index dropped 9.39 points to 727.92. Hindustan Lever was down 13 rupees at 812.</p>
<p>The Calcutta index shed 2.32 points to 423.81 and the Madras index fell 12.35 points to 3,408.97.</p>
