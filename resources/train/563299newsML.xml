<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sold near midday at $69.00 per cwt in moderate volume, up $1.00 from last week's active sales, feedlot sources and the U.S. Agriculture Department said.</p>
<p>About 7,000 head had sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area and about 5,000 in Kansas, sources said.  </p>
<p>Fed cattle prices were lifted by continued strong beef demand as retailers book orders for upcoming holiday promotions including Memorial Day, they said. Beef prices at midday were quoted up another $0.92 to $1.72 per cwt on 219 fabricated loads sold, USDA reported. Heavyweight choice beef was quoted up $1.32 at $108.70, up $2.47 since Friday's close, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>But sales in Kansas and the Panhandle area were slowed by resistance by some cattle owners to the $69.00 bids as they hold out for $70.00, several feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (packers) could have bought all they wanted at $69.00, if they had waited a day,&quot; one Kansas feedlot manager said.</p>
