<p>Massachusetts Senate President Thomas Birmingham said using the state budget is the most &quot;honest&quot; way to give tax breaks, State House News reported.</p>
<p>Birmingham's comments came at a Wednesday press conference announcing that the Senate budget, which will be released tomorrow, will include four tax cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the more responsible course of action,&quot; Birmingham said.  &quot;When we do it in the budget, the legislators are forced to make an apples to apples decision.&quot;</p>
<p>Birmingham and Senate Ways and Means Chairman Stanley Rosenberg (D-Amherst) unveiled $82 million worth of tax cuts in their version of the Fiscal Year 1998 spending plan.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>*lowering the unearned income tax deduction rate to 6 percent from 12 percent for senior citizens who earn less than $30,000 individually ($60,000 jointly), costing the state $30 million.</p>
<p>*doubling the child care dependency deduction to $1,200 from $600 for families who do not use the day care exemption, at a cost of $15.3 million.</p>
<p>*creating a state earned income tax credit on top of the federal credit,with a cost of $28.6 million.</p>
<p>*allowing taxpayers who are also paying off student loans to deduct 50 percent of the interest on the loans, at a cost of $8 million.</p>
<p>The Taxation Committee has before it versions of all four of the tax cuts.</p>
<p>Before the House debated its budget last month, House Speaker Thomas Finneran announced that the lower chamber would not address any of the tax cut issues Gov. William F. Weld put in his budget.  Finneran reasoned that matters as complicated as taxes should be studied at the committee level before being reported to the entire branch.</p>
<p>But Birmingham disagreed.</p>
<p>This is not the first difference of opinion held by the two branches recently.</p>
<p>Last year, a bond bill authorizing several construction projects around the state wound up dying after Rosenberg and House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Haley (D-Weymouth) battled over what should be included in the package.</p>
<p>This year, the House and Senate still have failed to reach a compromise on what unemployment insurance rates Bay State companies should pay, forcing an unwanted increase on the employers last month.</p>
<p>Birmingham also took aim at the seven tax cuts Weld was pushing.  He said the governor's cuts also totaled $82 million - in the first year. But since several would have been phased in over time, the entire burden would have been $660 million.</p>
<p>Birmingham called it a &quot;poison mushroom,&quot; because the revenues expand &quot;in out years.&quot;  The Senate cuts, he said, are &quot;static figures that will not grow.&quot;</p>
