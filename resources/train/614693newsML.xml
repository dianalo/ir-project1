<headline>Taiwan dollar ends lower, resumes downtrend.</headline>

<p>The Taiwan dollar reversed its early gains and closed lower against its U.S. counterpart on Monday due to widespread expectations of a resumed downtrend on local political concerns, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit closed at T$27.819 against one U.S. dollar. It had opened at an intra-day peak of T$27.790, reflecting the greenback's fall overseas against the German mark following the first round of French elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was a light US$149 million.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the fall was caused by persistent fund outflows on political concerns over recent anti-government protests in Taiwan and the island's ongoing constitutional reforms.</p>
<p>The concerns have caused the local unit to ease from its long-time T$27.5 support level in the past month.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors continue to think that the Taiwan dollar is locked in a downtrend against the U.S. currency, so profit-taking occurred soon after the initial rise,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>A T$27.79-84 range was seen for Tuesday.</p>
