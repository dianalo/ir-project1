<p>Philips Electronics NV said on Tuesday it planned to sell its 50 percent stake in cable television operator United and Philips Communications BV (UPC) as part of a continuing programme to divest non-core businesses.</p>
<p>The Dutch electronics giant said it was selling the UPC stake to United International Holdings Inc. of Denver, Colorado, its joint venture partner in UPC, raising gross proceeds of approximately 800 million guilders ($424.6 million) for Philips.</p>
<p>As part of the deal UPC will purchase all of Philips' 3.17 million shares of UIH class A common stock, a statement said.</p>
<p>A Philips spokesman said the deal was expected to be completed in the third quarter but declined to say how Philips planned to use the money raised by the sale.</p>
<p>&quot;As is widely known, Philips is currently reviewing its portfolio of activities. As a result, the company has concluded that its cable TV operation is not a core activity,&quot; said President and CEO of Philips Media Richard de Lange.</p>
<p>&quot;We said a few months ago that selling our stake in UPC would be an option,&quot; said Philips spokesman Ben Geerts, declining to say how much further the company had to go in ridding itself of non-core or underperforming businesses targeted by new Philips chairman Cor Boonstra.</p>
<p>Philips, which recently announced a bottom line loss for 1996, its first since 1992, has embarked on a stringent restructuring plan to weed out non-core businesses and tighten management as a way of boosting profits.</p>
<p>Philips said 308 million guilders of the money to be raised via the planned UPC deal would be in the form of new securities, issued by UPC. Philips will be able to sell these securities in the secondary market once the deal is completed.</p>
<p>UPC is Europe's largest private cable operator. On a proportionate basis, representing UPC's equity interest in various projects, it passes 1.9 million homes and has over 1.3 million subscribers, Philips said.</p>
<p>&quot;This transaction enables us to fully capitalise on multi-channel television and other communication assets we have systematically put in place in 14 countries throughout Europe and in Israel,&quot; UIH chairman Gene Schneider said.</p>
