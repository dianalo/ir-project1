<p>A German currency expert on Friday slammed Finance Minister Theo Waigel's proposals to revalue Bundesbank gold reserves as &quot;cooking the books&quot; and warned that the move could be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Hankel, a former German economics and finance ministry adviser, told the Berliner Zeitung daily that if a listed company were to behave in the same way it would lose all credibility with the banks and its shareholders.</p>
<p>Waigel, faced with an 18 billion mark ($10.6 billion) tax revenue shortfall, said this week if gold reserves were revalued from current low book prices to levels close to the normal market price it could help solve the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be cooking the books. Any private company that manipulates its profit figures loses the confidence of the banks and its shares collapse. What the German government is planning is no different,&quot; Hankel said in an interview.</p>
<p>Hankel said that Waigel's proposal aimed at helping Germany tighten its finances to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU) was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>He said that currency reserves did not just belong to the state but to the economy as a whole and was not there to plug gaps in the budget but as a guarantee in an emergency.</p>
<p>German press commentators called Waigel's grab for Bundesbank gold a desperate move to help Bonn qualify for Europe's single currency that would not boost the economy.</p>
<p>Germany has been strongly against any kind of budget fudges for EMU qualification, but record unemployment -- which Waigel said could average 4.3 million in 1997 -- means Bonn is struggling to meet the Maastricht criteria.</p>
