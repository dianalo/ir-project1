<p>Sariye Nadyrshina wears a tall hat of asbestos throughout her working day, using her head like a shelf on which to store coils of asbestos before she lays them on ageing spindles.</p>
<p>She knows that exposure to asbestos can cause cancer but living in this Urals town, the world's largest source of the mineral, she is glad to still have a job in these tough economic times.</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid for my health, but I've already been here so many years that I would like to stay until retirement age,&quot; said Nadyrshina, who at 38 is a 20-year veteran of the Uralati factory. She becomes eligible for a pension at 45.</p>
<p>Like the asbestos fibres that float gently down through the air in her factory, the economy of Asbest -- population 83,000 -- has not come crashing to the ground in recent years, despite predictions that a town built on asbestos could never survive the market economy.</p>
<p>DEMAND BRISK AFTER DIFFICULT YEARS</p>
<p>For several difficult years factory managers in Asbest, situated near the divide between European and Asian Russia, felt an obligation to their workers, firing few as debts mounted and orders dwindled.</p>
<p>Then a few months ago, they began suddenly seeing a growth in demand for asbestos, the fibres of which are used as a binding element in construction materials and automobile parts.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately there is now demand for our product, and it's more than we can produce at present,&quot; said Yury Kozlov, director of Uralasbest, the world's largest asbestos mining company with 11,000 workers.</p>
<p>Touring the three-by-11 km (two-by-seven mile) gap in the earth that is the asbestos mine straddling the town, Vladimir Kochelayev said: &quot;I've worked here six years in management and these are the first rays of hope I have seen.&quot;</p>
<p>Shunned by the United States and much of Europe since the late 1970s and 1980s, asbestos remains a construction staple in many developing nations, and Uralasbest has seen higher sales in Brazil, India and China as well as domestically, officials said.</p>
<p>Asbest supplies about 20 to 25 percent of the world's asbestos and about two thirds of the Russian supply, they said.</p>
<p>ASBESTOS IS OUR FRIEND, OFFICIALS SAY</p>
<p>Officials here describe the growing consciousness in the West about the health risks of asbestos as a tactic by firms offering alternative products.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it comes from a struggle among competitors to win market share,&quot; Mayor Vladimir Vlasov said in an interview.</p>
<p>Factory managers have undertaken some safety improvements since the 1960s, when a snow-like storm of white asbestos fibres would descend on the central streets from nearby factories.</p>
<p>Today, they say life expectancy is longer than many other cities in the heavily polluted Urals region and asbestos causes only a tiny handful of illnesses each year.</p>
<p>Vlasov recalled that he recently met two residents who had endured more than a century of asbestos exposure and who were in good health at the ages of 102 and 104.</p>
<p>NEED TO DIVERSIFY RECOGNISED</p>
<p>Even as they embrace the fibrous mineral that gave the town its name, business leaders have begun to realise that diversification is the key to long-term profitability.</p>
<p>At Uralati, which converts raw asbestos into finished materials, a $420,000 investment by a group of Canadian-based investors -- which has a 15 percent stake in the company -- is helping them develop asbestos-free automobile brake pads, said director Lev Zverev.</p>
<p>At NIIproyektasbest, the city's asbestos research and design firm, officials are trying to market machines made for extracting asbestos from rocks as processors suitable for preparing cattle feed, sugar and other products.</p>
<p>&quot;We have learned that you cannot live only on one part of the economy, you must adapt to other sectors,&quot; said director Viktor Ivanov.</p>
<p>He said his firm just about broke even last year by diversifying, and Zverev said Uralati saw a 42-billion rouble ($7.6 million) paper profit.</p>
<p>But Zverev said that figure exaggerates the firm's wealth as 87 percent of all sales were in barter.</p>
<p>At Uralsasbest, the mining firm which is most dependent on asbestos, output is just a quarter of what is was in the boom years of the mid 1970s and it has lost money for years.</p>
<p>But officials say the worst is over, and success will soon come Asbest's way again.</p>
<p>&quot;I love my city, and I'm convinced it has a big future,&quot; said Mayor Vlasov. &quot;We are a city of construction materials and as soon as this country revives its construction, then our economy will do very well, perhaps in five to 10 years time.&quot;</p>
