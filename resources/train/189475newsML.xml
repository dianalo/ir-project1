<p>A plan approved on Thursday to consolidate peace in Bosnia over the next two years emphasizes the return of refugees, cooperation with a war crimes tribunal and democratisation in the former Yugoslav republic.</p>
<p>Following are highlights of the &quot;Guiding Principles of the Civilian Consolidation Plan&quot;, agreed by Bosnia's three co-presidents and major world powers at a one-day conference in Paris.</p>
<p>--- Much has been achieved towards lasting peace since last year's Dayton accord ended nearly four years of war but progress on the return of refugees in the ethnically divided country has been &quot;only modest&quot;.</p>
<p>-- The Bosnian authorities undertake to establish all joint institutions, including a council of ministers, a parliament, a central bank and a constitutional court and make them operational as soon as possible.</p>
<p>-- The plan links international aid to full compliance by Bosnia's leaders with the Dayton peace accord. &quot;Recognising the fundamental importance of a secure environment&quot;, it welcomes the fact that NATO is studying options to maintain security.</p>
<p>-- It lists 13 priorities for the consolidation period: - reducing armaments to the lowest possible level - restoring law and order through an independent judiciary and democratic police forces - ensuring full respect of human rights - building a genuine democracy and promoting freedom of expression - holding municipal elections next year and general elections in 1998 - ensuring freedom of movement for people, goods and services throughout the country - helping refugees return home by improving security, housing and jobs - surrendering indicted war crime suspects to the international tribunal - fostering the peace process through reconstruction and economic aid, and rewarding communities that cooperate - agreeing to an economic programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and making the necessary legal reforms to build a market economy - restoring contacts between all the country's peoples and efforting to solve the cases of missing persons in order to promote long-term reconciliation - restoring the education system - removing landmines.</p>
<p>-- International mediator Carl Bildt will present a one-year action programme at a conference in London on December 4-5, with another review conference in a year's time.</p>
<p>-- Bildt's role should be reinforced in solving conflicting interpretations of the peace settlement and making recommendations to the Bosnian authorities.</p>
