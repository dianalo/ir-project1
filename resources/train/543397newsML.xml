<p>Polish shares on Monday fell for the third session running and analysts said Friday's central bank decision to increase mandatory reserves on zloty term deposits from April 30 had cooled market sentiment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the decision could hurt the overall market as well as banks, which make up about 40 percent of the main market's capitalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll likely fall a bit more tomorrow, then maybe a one or two-day rebound, then falls....That decision hurts other (non-bank) firms as less money on the market means less money for goods,&quot; said Dariusz Piszczatowski of PBR brokerage.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 2.1 percent to 16,316.6 points and turnover fell 10.2 percent to 161 million zlotys ($50.9 million) on all three markets. Losers led gainers by 76 to eight with 11 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said Monday's news that food prices rose only 0.2 percent in the second 10 days of April was a good sign but that it was overshadowed by Friday's central bank decision.</p>
<p>They said Monday's biggest loser, Espebepe, fell nearly 10 percent for the third session running after Thursday's news the largest creditor of the debt-ridden builder is against the debt-restructuring deal it proposed.</p>
<p>Analysts said mass privatisation NFI units fell 3.5 percent and 2.7 percent on Friday after Thursday's news the finance ministry would scrap in 1998 the corporate tax exemption NFIs enjoy on gains from selling firms in their portfolios.</p>
<p>They said Celuloza Swiecie fell seven percent in active trade as investors took profits after Poland's largest paper firm's 21.5-zloty ($6.8) bourse debut on Friday, with the stock seen hurt by weaker first-quarter earnings.</p>
