<headline>Brazil stocks end sharply down, Telebras nosedives.</headline>

<p>Brazilian shares took another big hit Thursday, plummeting 7.22 percent by the close as speculative selling of the bolsa's most traded stock dragged down the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>Telebras preferred, which accounts for over 50 percent of trade, plunged 8.7 percent to close at 147 reais.</p>
<p>With Thursday's nosedive, the bolsa lost most of the ground it had regained Wednesday after the Bovespa index's sharp decline the previous day.</p>
<p>The index closed 913 points lower at 11,728 points. Total market turnover was high at 1.44 billion reais ($1.3 billion).  </p>
<p>Financial volume for the shares of the Bovespa index portfolio was 1.28 billion reais ($1.19 billion).</p>
<p>The heavy selling pressure was triggered by comments by a Telebras official who said the state-run telecommunications holding company was preparing to cut rates to meet competition from private service providers.</p>
<p>&quot;Telebras is under pressure to reduce its tariffs given the new spirit of competition in the market,&quot; the company's director of services, Daltron Magalhaes, told reporters.</p>
<p>Magalhaes said it would reduce special rates for corporate users from August, and wider rate cuts could come next year.  </p>
<p>Although rate reductions were not unexpected, the news sparked a wave of selling in a market characterized by extreme volatility.</p>
<p>&quot;At a nervous market like that, anything can trigger that kind of moves... This is not normal, this is irrational,&quot; said Manuel Maceira, asset manager at Banco Tendencia.</p>
<p>Analysts also said sell orders from domestic equity funds to cover withdrawals from retail investors may have contributed to the decline.  </p>
<p>Traders believe most of the investors who are withdrawing money from the funds are non-traditional participants in the bolsa. Such investors entered the funds lured by stunning gains the local stock market has provided since the beginning of the year and are now putting the higher returns into their pockets.</p>
<p>The comments on Telebras' future rate cuts hit a bolsa already rattled by a frenetic profit-taking early in the week. That round was triggered by concerns that Brazil could become the target of speculative moves that forced some Asian nations devalue their currencies recently.</p>
