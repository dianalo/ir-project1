<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin &quot;resting&quot; at state residence - Kremlin.</title>
<headline>Yeltsin &quot;resting&quot; at state residence - Kremlin.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-01-26</dateline>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin was resting on Sunday at an official residence outside Moscow following his treatment for pneumonia, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no new information. He is resting because it is not a working day,&quot; a spokesman at the presidential press office said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, has been at the Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow since he was released from hospital last Monday after 12 days of treatment for pneumonia.</p>
<p>Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky says Yeltsin had been to the Kremlin once since his release from hospital, for talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has not been seen in public and no television footage of him has been released since before he was taken to hospital with pneumonia of both lungs on January 8.</p>
<p>His latest illness, following heart problems last year which forced him out of the Kremlin for nearly six months, has prompted his political opponents to demand his dismissal for health reasons.</p>
<p>The president, who turns 66 on February 1, is due to receive French President Jacques Chirac on February 2 and travel to the Hague on February 3 for talks with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, whose country holds the rotating European Union presidency.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky dismissed speculation on Saturday that Chirac's visit would be cancelled.</p>
<p>&quot;President Boris Yeltsin has already started on direct preparations for the meeting with the President of France, Jacques Chirac,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;Boris Nikolayevich asked for the necessary materials and documents today.&quot;</p>
