<p>Austria's GiroCredit AG took a 40-percent stake in the Polish unit of Investmentbank Austria AG, boosting the latter's capital to 22.5 million zlotys, the Polish unit's head said on Monday.</p>
<p>Jacek Krawczyk, President of IB Austria Securities SA, told a news briefing that the partnership and the capital increase would allow his firm to expand its activities in its efforts to offer a full range of investment banking services.</p>
<p>&quot;The capital increase makes IB Austria Securities the strongest non-banking securities house in Poland in terms of capital,&quot; Krawczyk said.</p>
<p>He said that IB Austria Securities, which was commemorating the first anniversary of its operations, would soon launch commercial paper borrowing, having received a licence to offer short-term debt securities earlier this month.</p>
<p>Krawczyk also said that the brokerage would seek licences to offer portfolio management and recommendations in order to offer a full range of services.</p>
<p>He said that even though the house quickly established itself as a significant player on the secondary securities market with about a two-percent share of turnover, the primary market remained its main focus.</p>
<p>Krawczyk said that more than 90 percent of IB Austria's secondary-market business was generated by Polish institutional clients.</p>
<p>He said that because of this year's light menu of new issues, especially privatisation offerings, the country's mass privatisation programme was the main source of interesting projects.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a paradox that a programme designed as a one-time hybrid is now the main source of interesting privatisation projects,&quot; Krawczyk said.</p>
<p>He said IB Austria Securities saw its greatest opportunities in mid-sized offerings.</p>
