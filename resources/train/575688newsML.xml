<title>YUGOSLAVIA: Demand said weak for Yugoslav T-bills.</title>
<headline>Demand said weak for Yugoslav T-bills.</headline>
<dateline>BELGRADE 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Yugoslavia's government put on sale for the first time 100 million dinars ($17.77 million) worth of Treasury bills on Monday but sold only 50,000 dinars worth by noon, the Belgrade bourse said.</p>
<p>Traders said demand was weak because the central bank had not yet decided whether to offer commercial banks some benefits for investing in T-bills.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) was expected to offer banks a possibility to use T-bills for liquidity purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;This would have been the best way towards establishing a real secondary market in those bills. If banks were motivated to buy, they would resell the bills to their clients,&quot; a bourse official said.</p>
<p>The government said earlier it would raise 100 million dinars via 30-day and 60-day T-bills to finance the army's liabilities with commercial suppliers.</p>
<p>T-bills, issued at 500, 1,000 and 10,000 dinars face value, can be bought by companies at the local bourse and individuals through licenced banks and used for paying customs and other import duties.</p>
<p>The paper carries a 4.5 percent in monthly interest.</p>
<p>But if bought today, the investor will get a 6.8 percent in real monthly interest for 30-day bills and nine percent per month for 60-day bills because a proportional method is applied for calculating interest, the bourse said.</p>
