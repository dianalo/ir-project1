<headline>Ecuador's Bucaram warns could take &quot;all powers&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>QUITO, Ecuador 1997-02-06</dateline>

<p>Ecuador's President Abdala Bucaram, facing the threat of a congressional move to dismiss him, said on Thursday he would take &quot;all powers&quot; necessary if the constitutional order was threatened.</p>
<p>&quot;The government makes clear that in the case of an attempt to break with constitutional order, I will assume all of the powers available to protect the legitimacy of the popular will and the national judicial order,&quot; he said in an address to the nation.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the government said an extraordinary congressional session called for 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) by speaker Fabian Alarcon was unconstitutional as the decision to meet had not been advertised in local newspapers.</p>
<p>&quot;Without such a statement having been published up to this morning, the speaker of Congress is assuring that there will be an extraordinary session to resolve the country's political crisis. If it proceeds in this way, it will be illegal and unconstitutional,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>In his address, well before the officially scheduled time, Bucaram also said he was suspending big price rises in gas and electricity prices which helped trigger a wave of popular unrest, and freezing fuel prices.</p>
<p>Unions earlier said that they had decided to extend indefinitely the 48-hour general strike they began Wednesday until Bucaram was dismissed.</p>
