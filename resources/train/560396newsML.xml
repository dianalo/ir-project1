<headline>NYMEX natgas down late on profit taking, cash up.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-05</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures, hit by some profit taking after recent gains,  mostly remained lower late Monday in moderate trade, but few saw much downside with Gulf Coast physical prices still firm.</p>
<p>At 1440 EDT, June slipped 3.2 cents to $2.235 per million British thermal units, while July was 1.9 cents lower at $2.27. Most other months were down by one-half to three cents.</p>
<p>&quot;I expected to see the profit taking Friday, but we're definitely getting it today, but fundamentally and technically, it still feels strong,&quot; said one East Coast trader, noting buyers outnumbered sellers in the cash.  </p>
<p>While most agreed the market was due for a technical pullback after a nine percent rally last week, sources said steady buying in the cash this month from injection demand and some cooling and heating load was likely to limit the downside near-term.</p>
<p>Chart traders pegged resistance in June at $2.33 and then at the $2.385 contract high. Support was seen at $2.17, then at $2.05 and along the up trendline at $2.03.</p>
<p>In the cash, Gulf Coast prices were talked up a couple of cents Monday to near the $2.20 level, with gas at Henry Hub pegged in the low-to-mid $2.20s. Midcon pipes were steady to off slightly at about $2. New York city gate gas was slightly firmer in the mid-to-high $2.40s.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Northeast and upper Midwest are expected to range near to slightly below normal this week. Warmer-than-normal weather in the Southwast should lead to an increase in air conditioning demand there.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 20,779 contracts traded at 1345 EDT. Hub open interest on May 2 rose 3,812 contracts to a record 202,403.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, June slipped 2.7 cents to $2.07, while most deferreds were steady to down four cents. The East/West spread narrowed by one-half cents to 16.5 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
