<p>Canada's government introduced a bill on Monday to retaliate against a controversial U.S. law designed to curb foreign investment in Cuba.</p>
<p>The bill, details of which were revealed in June, counters the Helms-Burton law which provides for penalties against some foreign companies that do business with the communist-ruled Caribbean island.</p>
<p>&quot;Helms-Burton is an unwarranted move to extend the arm of U.S. law into trade between other countries,&quot; International Trade Minister Art Eggleton declared.</p>
<p>The bill parallels similar measures being considered by the European Union's foreign ministers to limit the effects both of Helms-Burton and a second law, the D'Amato legislation, which targets Iran and Libya.</p>
<p>Canada's counter-legislation would allow Canadians to countersue in Canadian courts to recover damages awarded by U.S. courts under Helms-Burton.</p>
<p>It would also allow Canada to issue &quot;blocking&quot; orders declaring that judgments handed down under any objectionable foreign law would not be enforced or recognized in Canada.</p>
<p>The bill, which would amend the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act, is not expected to face any major hurdles in Canadian Parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The FEMA changes are a deterrent against U.S. companies seeking to penalize Canadian firms doing legitimate business with Cuba,&quot; Eggleton said.</p>
<p>Under one of Helms-Burton's provisions, U.S. citizens and companies are allowed to sue foreign firms using property confiscated after the 1959 communist revolution in Cuba. Senior executives and shareholders of such companies, as well as their families, can be denied entry into the United States.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton signed Helms-Burton under the pressure of an election year and waived for half a year the measure allowing suits against foreign firms as a means of appeasing allies like Canada, the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada decided to proceed with counter-measures in case Clinton decides not to extend the waiver.</p>
<p>Eggleton said Canada was continuing to consider a challenge under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which groups Washington, Ottawa and Mexico City.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not in any way backing away from anything,&quot; he said, though Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Canada was awaiting a decision on the verdict by the Organization of American States before making a decision on NAFTA.</p>
