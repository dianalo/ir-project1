<p>Hong Kong stocks finished modestly higher on Wednesday after profit-taking trimmed sharp early gains piled up during a blue-chip rebound led by property counters, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was up 71.41 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 14,831.58. It had risen almost 220 points to a day's high of 14,979.76 earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;People took profits after the index was unable to move back to the 15,000 level,&quot; said Jason Tang of institutional sales at South China Securities. &quot;They are likely to continue to unload their portfolios ahead of the long week-end.&quot;  </p>
<p>The market will be closed on Monday for the Dragon Boat Festival. &quot;Trading was a bit boring this afternoon with profit-taking seen on property stocks and individual red-chips,&quot; said Ricky Tam, senior reseach analyst at Delta Asia Securities.</p>
<p>A belated judgement that the results of the government land auction on Tuesday was positive overall helped property stocks recoup some of their losses from that day, but the market seemed headed for a consolidation, analysts said.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong added HK$1.75 to HK$79.50 and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HK$0.50 at HK$96.25. HSBC also rose HK$1.00 to HK$228.00.</p>
