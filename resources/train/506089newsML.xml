<p>Workers have already planted trees around a new reactor at Ukraine's Rivne nuclear plant, the completion of which would help pave the way for the shutdown of Chernobyl.</p>
<p>President Leonid Kuchma has promised to close Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear accident, by the turn of the century in return for billions of dollars of Western cash to complete various projects, including two new nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>But it is not clear when the plants -- reactor No 4 at Rivne and No 2 at Khmelnytsky in western Ukraine -- will actually open.</p>
<p>The two units are 80-85 percent built but doubt has crept into plans for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to manage the financing.</p>
<p>THE CHERNOBYL FACTOR</p>
<p>&quot;Without these two reactors it would be very hard to close Chernobyl by 2000. We cannot lose any electricity in our energy balance. Chernobyl must be replaced,&quot; Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko told Reuters.</p>
<p>Up to 300 workers are working on the reactor which looms to the height of a 16-storey building at the edge of Kuznetsovsk near Rivne, some 370 km (230 miles) west of the capital, Kiev.</p>
<p>The interior has been freshly painted but the lifts are not working at the plant, where construction began in 1985 -- a year before the Chernobyl disaster.</p>
<p>In 1991 parliament, confident after winning independence from Moscow, announced a moratorium on building new reactors.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not stop building despite the moratorium -- we did it under cover of so-called conservation of the reactor,&quot; said Volodymyr Steshenko, Rivne's chief spokesman. &quot;Of course we were lying. But we believed the moratorium was a stupid idea though it looked like a temporary step.</p>
<p>&quot;If there were no Chernobyl our fourth reactor would have started working long ago. Or if there were still a Soviet Union... The communists would bring thousands of workers and order them to work day and night.&quot;</p>
<p>Rivne's first reactor was built in 1980 and a second one a year later. Both are VVER-440s, a design which would contain the impact of the kind of chain reaction which blew the roof off Chernobyl's RBMK-type reactor in April 1986.</p>
<p>The third unit was completed months after the Chernobyl blast blew contamination across much of Europe.</p>
<p>The plan was to build a total of six reactors at Rivne but now only the fourth one has a real chance of completion.</p>
<p>THE LOW-COST OPTION</p>
<p>Ukraine is relying on EBRD funding to complete Rivne-4 and Khmelnytsky-2 but the process has been complicated by a report by an international panel of experts which said completing the reactors did not meet bank requirements as a financial project.</p>
<p>Rivne-4 needs an additional $300 million -- Ukraine has already spent some $450-470 million. Khmelnytsky-2 needs some $470 million, due to come partly from the EBRD and partly from the European Commission's Euroatom nuclear fund.</p>
<p>John Surrey, the chairman of the EBRD panel, told the British Broadcasting Service's Ukrainian Service that EBRD money should be spent to make district heating systems, hospitals and other public buildings more efficient.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that power shortage, power cuts are unacceptable for the people of Ukraine. We saw the hardship...You don't need it,&quot; he said. &quot;We believe that it is very important to reinforce the transmission and distribution system in Ukraine to reduce the power losses.&quot;</p>
<p>But Kostenko said installing energy-saving technologies and renovating public buildings would take decades, while Chernobyl could be replaced in three years.</p>
<p>The panel also said it would be better to modernise Ukraine's thermal stations, which produce about half of its electricity.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission's conclusions were not properly motivated, they were groundless. They were based on statistics which were not based on the real state of Ukraine's energy sector, especially at thermal power stations,&quot; Yuri Poluneyev, EBRD's Ukrainian director, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of ageing equipment at thermal stations 40 percent of electricity has been lost. Even after modernisation a lot of electricity and money will be wasted,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Bank had already had a negative experience in dealing with nuclear power, at Slovakia's Mohovce plant. A project to construct a plant there was shelved after objections by environmental groups and neighbouring Hungary.</p>
<p>&quot;Also they (the panel) wanted to be very careful with these two reactors. They are under pressure from 'green' organisations (in Europe),&quot; Poluneyev said.</p>
<p>WITHOUT NEW REACTORS NO FUTURE FOR NUCLEAR INDUSTRY</p>
<p>It is still unclear when the EBRD will decide on the loan but almost everyone at Rivne is sure that the fourth reactor will be completed -- sooner or later.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be so happy when we complete this reactor,&quot; says Vasyl Andriyevsky, 27, the reactor's future duty officer. &quot;It is so stupid to waste such efforts. The destruction of this reactor would be more difficult and expensive than its completion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With only one reactor my people feel they have no future,&quot; said Viktor Sapronov, head of Khmelnitsky plant, said. &quot;No new reactors would mean a big blow to our nuclear industry&quot;.</p>
