<p>Stocks of germanium held by Russia loom over the market, ensuring a switch to a surplus by the year end, Dennis Thomas, general manager of Eagle Picher Industries said.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian stocks are a very big threat in the near term,&quot; Thomas told Metal Bulletin's Minor Metals Seminar here.</p>
<p>The Russian government has reportedly allocated as much as 8,500 kilograms of germanium metal, and 29,000 kilograms of germanium dioxide for immediate disposal, Thomas said.</p>
<p>They may be in a race to sell metal before the U.S. government begins selling for the first time surplus germanium from the national stockpile on March 24 when 4,000 kilograms of metal will be up for grabs, Thomas added.</p>
<p>&quot;This year there is a shortfall in production compared to demand, but all of this material from the former Soviet Union and the U.S. Stockpile could produce a 10 to 20 percent surplus by the end of the year,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Following his presentation, Francoise de Vaulgrenant of French germanium producer Metaleurop SA, part of Germany's Preussag Stahl AG, doubted if all the Russian stockpile metal mentioned would be sold this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's such a big figure. Before the Russian stockpile there was a lack of supply, but I don't think they will release everything,&quot; de Vaulgrenant told Reuters.</p>
<p>Both Eagle Picher and Metaleurop have been asked to invest in CIS germanium production plants, but both have refused. Along with Union Miniere SA, they are the leading Western producers of germanium, a strategic metal used in infra-red applications.</p>
<p>Thomas reiterated his view that prices of germanium metal needed to fall to about $1,000 a kilogram to secure consumption and stave off substitution. Current metal prices are about $1,500 a kilo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Russia is also beginning to liquidate some of its 48 tonnes of gallium stocks as a data gathering stage in the &quot;Neutrino&quot; experiments are wound up.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of that is already being moved,&quot; Thomas said.</p>
<p>Similar experiments were held in Europe and, if the data gathering phase is ending there, it would indicate that a further 30 tonnes of gallium would become surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of this overhang of material in the near term, I don't think prices will increase until next year,&quot; Thomas said. He pegged seven 9s grade gallium at $450 to $500 a kilo at present.</p>
