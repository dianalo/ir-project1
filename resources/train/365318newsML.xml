<title>USA: Psychic leads Florida woman to dog in New York.</title>
<headline>Psychic leads Florida woman to dog in New York.</headline>
<dateline>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla 1997-02-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Fort Lauderdale woman was enjoying a joyous reunion with her missing dog Saturday, thanks to some psychics, protest rallies and a mysterious telephone call from a man called Elvis.</p>
<p>Barbara Listenik told the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel that her dog Boris, a 50-pound mixed breed basenji, vanished on Christmas Eve after arriving at New York's LaGuardia airport on a Delta flight.</p>
<p>After reaching the Big Apple, the dog apparently tore a steel door off his shipping cage and led cargo handlers and police on a chase across several busy runways into Queens.</p>
<p>Listenik combed the city and posted fliers, in a search that was featured on New York television news. One person watching was Paula Forester, a psychic who drove around Queens and &quot;psychically zeroes in on an area,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>More than 500 people helped cover the neighbourhood with fliers over the next several weeks, while another psychic sent messages to Boris to keep her near food and water while the search continued.</p>
<p>Finally, a delivery worker, who identified himself only as Elvis, called and reported seeing Boris in the area of Queens where Forester had said Boris seemed to be. And late Thursday night, Forester got a call from a young man who said he had been taking care of a stray dog that had been abandoned, which he realised was Boris after seeing a poster.</p>
<p>Listenik was reunited with Boris early Friday morning. &quot;When I saw Boris, I fell to the ground screaming and crying,&quot; she said. &quot;I just couldn't believe it.&quot;</p>
