<title>UK: CRICKET-GRAVENEY NAMED AS CHAIRMAN OF SELECTORS.</title>
<headline>CRICKET-GRAVENEY NAMED AS CHAIRMAN OF SELECTORS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-13</dateline>

<p>Former Gloucestershire and Durham captain David Graveney was named as England's new chairman of selectors on Thursday and said he was cautiously optimistic about the side's future prospects.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't had too much success in the last four or five years but we can certainly build on the results we've had in New Zealand and on those back-to-back test victories,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Graveney replaces Ray Illingworth, who retired at the end of the last English season.</p>
<p>His appointment on a two-year contract was confirmed at a news conference at Lord's during which former England captains Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting were named as selectors.</p>
<p>Essex opening batsman Gooch has been given a two-year contract while Gatting has been taken on for a year.</p>
<p>Graveney originally challenged Illingworth for the high-profile post of chairman of selectors a year ago but had to withdraw when the English Professional Cricketers' Association, of which he is general secretary, complained of a conflict of interests.</p>
<p>The chairman's role has been modified since then to allow Graveney to combine both posts.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been redefined but I don't think it's less important than it was,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't have anything much more important than selecting the 11 or 12 or 13 people who are going to play for your country. I just think it's a little bit more discrete and doesn't overflow into the management function.&quot;</p>
<p>Graveney would not be drawn on whether Mike Atherton would retain his post as England captain.</p>
<p>&quot;Graham Gooch and Mike Gatting and I have got to sit down and talk to Mike,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be very wrong for me to cast my opinion in public without consulting the other two.&quot;</p>
