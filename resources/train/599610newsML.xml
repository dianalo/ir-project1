<p>Local and foreign investors are looking to the Thai government over the next week to see what sort of measures it will announce to help boost liquidity in the system, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to know what exactly they plan to announce, and when it will be,&quot; said one foreign analyst. &quot;Everyone is curious to see what they will do.&quot;</p>
<p>The battered Thai bourse, which took a hammering over the past few weeks on a combination of bad news, an attack on the baht currency and a poor outlook for the once-booming economy, was bolstered on Monday after a $1.92 billion support fund aimed at supporting the market was announced.</p>
<p>The market, which has dropped about 32 percent so far this year to eight-year lows, ended 15.91 points higher on Monday to finish at 577.10 points.</p>
<p>Markets were closed on Tuesday for a religious holiday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the support fund boosted the bourse, as did export figures announced just before the close.</p>
<p>Two sets of export figures were announced by different agencies on Monday and although the numbers varied, both sets showed growth over last year. Thailand's sluggish export performance in 1996 contributed to the economy slowing to 6.7 percent -- the slowest level in a decade.</p>
<p>Analysts said the reaction to export figures showed the bearish market was seeking any hint of good news to help boost sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like when things are really dry, just a drop of water seems great,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh told journalists on Monday he thought the worst was over for the bearish Thai market, and investors could start looking for improvement soon.</p>
<p>He said the government had effectively stopped a speculative attack on the baht which was no longer in danger.</p>
<p>Chavalit said the government planned a series of measures that will be announced later this week and next.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate but said there would be about four or five measures directly related to the property sector, which has been hard hit by the sluggish economy and a liquidity crunch.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond told journalists on Monday the Bank of Thailand plans to issue three to four new monetary measures this week, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>One measure could be a cut in the discount rate by the Bank of Thailand, in order to get commercial banks to reduce interest rates which are currently among the highest in the region at 13-13.25 percent.</p>
<p>A finance ministry official was quoted by a newspaper on Tuesday as saying the central bank would announce a one percentage point reduction in its discount rate on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks on loans from the Bank of Thailand. It currently stands at 10.50 percent and was last cut on March 1, 1995.</p>
<p>A finance ministry official would not confirm the report but said banks thought any rate cut should be led by the central bank. Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said on Monday commercial banks would likely cut rates by 200 basis points this year.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Bank of Thailand really cut the discount rate later this week, it would be a good sign as the interest rate would come down a bit faster,&quot; said an analyst from a U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>&quot;A cut of one percentage point in the discount rate won't bring the commercial bank lending rate down substantially but at least it is just a step in the right direction.&quot;</p>
