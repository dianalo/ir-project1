<p>NWE spot naphtha prices were firmer on Friday lifted by stronger crude and gasoline markets and tight Mediterranean supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said arbitrage trade to the Far East had drawn heavily on key Algerian and Egyptian naphtha supplies through March.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the March Algerian barrels are set to go east and three of four Egyptian cargoes are heading that way too,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Saudi gasoline buying following hefty sales of naphtha into Japan and an open arbitrage for gasoline to the United states were also seen helping to strengthen naphtha.</p>
<p>But traders said buyers would be reluctant to push the market too high for fear of boosting benchmark quotes prices related to cargoes they already had booked to go East.</p>
<p>Despite the gains, buying interest from petrochemical users remained relaxed but traders said they expected the strengthening gasoline market to draw demand from reformers as margins improve.</p>
<p>Physical cargo prices were around $5-8 a tonne firmer but talked in a wider notional range around $190/$197 cif. April paper was bid around $197 but sellers on both spot and paper markets were scarce.</p>
