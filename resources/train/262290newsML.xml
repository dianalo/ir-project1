<p>--The economic burden of the continuing farmers' blockades will continue to be felt for months, the government says, with business organisations estimating losses in the region of 170 billion drachmas; the state is estimated to have already lost over 30 billion drachmas in customs tariffs and VAT. The blockades has also meant that the state will not cut interest rates on state titles further this year, a loss of 15 billion drachmas as well as another 15 billion expected to be paid as a corrective to pensions for this year.</p>
<p>--The OECD has called the government's economic targets for next year difficult particularly in regard to deficits. There is a possibility of further corrective measures, the OECD report - to be released Thursday - says.</p>
