<p>Ireland's Timarida is fit and will bid for Hollywood stardom in Sunday's Grade One Matriarch Stakes in California, a spokesperson for trainer John Oxx said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Timarida is in great form and has worked well at Hollywood Park this week. She is ready for the race,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The filly has already won three Grade One races in 1996.</p>
<p>She won a Group One race in Germany in July and followed that up with victory the Beverly D Stakes at Arlington in August before she delighted home supporters in landing the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on September 14.</p>
<p>Timarida will have regular partner Johnny Murtagh, 26, on board for Sunday's $700,000 presentation.</p>
<p>Murtagh, who successfully retained his champion flat jockey title in 1996, flew to the United States from Hong Kong, where he is riding during the winter, this week to re-new partnership with the filly.</p>
<p>He was on board  when the filly won Group Two races at Longchamp and Woodbine, Canada, towards the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Altogether Timarida has won 10 of her 15 races.</p>
<p>Murtagh and Oxx are no strangers to major success in the United States, the pair having combined to guide Ridgewood Pearl to win the Breeders Cup Mile in New York last year.</p>
