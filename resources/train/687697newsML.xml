<p>Tokyo stock market pundits on Wednesday applauded a survey showing big Japanese manufacturers were cheering up but U.S. officials who worry about Japan's bulging trade surplus may not be as pleased.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's quarterly &quot;tankan&quot; survey, released on Wednesday, showed that the diffusion index for big manufacturers -- a key gauge of corporate sentiment -- rose to plus seven in June from plus two in March, when the previous survey was conducted.</p>
<p>The key figure was stronger than expected and caused a financial market frenzy, battering the dollar and bonds but igniting a more than one-percent jump in Tokyo share prices.</p>
<p>A central bank official told reporters that one big factor behind the improvement in manufacturing sentiment was a rise in exports, a fact not likely to be welcomed in Washington given its repeated warnings against at rise in Tokyo's trade surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;One must be concerned about what the United States might say,&quot; said one Japanese economist.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton on Sunday warned that Japan was risking an economic war with the United States if its trade surplus started exploding again.</p>
<p>&quot;If we return to a time when we've got exploding trade deficits then that will once again move front and centre into our relationship in a way that won't be good for either country,&quot; Clinton said after the Group of Seven (G7) industrial nations' summit in Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p>Apparently irritated with U.S. lecturing on trade, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Monday stunned U.S. markets and risked fraying two-way ties when he said Japan had in the past been tempted to sell off its holdings of U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p>Hashimoto urged Washington to cooperate to stabilise currency markets so that Tokyo would not succumb to the temptation to sell its U.S. Treasury bills.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka sought to undo the damage, insisting Japan had no intention of selling its U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p>Economists said that for now Japan was reaping the benefits of robust exports, although Finance Ministry officials are keen to play down that aspect given U.S. pressure to rein in the trade gap and its criticism of Tokyo's tight fiscal policy.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, it looks like Japan is having an old-fashioned export-led recovery,&quot; said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. &quot;This makes it more uncomfortable for MOF (the Ministry of Finance).&quot;</p>
<p>Japanese non-manufacturers and smaller firms, meanwhile, remained significantly less optimistic, the tankan showed.</p>
<p>BOJ official Masayuki Matsushima, however, told reporters that while exports may temporarily increase in the first half of the current business year which ends on March 31, 1998, the overall trend would be towards a decline.</p>
<p>Some economists said more robust domestic demand expected to emerge in coming months would help dampen any export drive.</p>
<p>&quot;In the July-September quarter there will be a recovery in domestic demand so the strength in external demand will weaken,&quot; said Susumu Kato, chief economist at BZW Securities.</p>
<p>If so, U.S. trade pressure, which some analysts see as generated more by domestic political concerns than serious economic worries, would likely ease. &quot;If the surplus is still going through the roof...then of course the U.S. will get angry, but the surplus should calm down and if that is the case, the U.S. will back off,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>Others were less optimistic. &quot;I don't see any big reason for domestic demand to strengthen much in the second half,&quot; the Japanese economist said. &quot;For the time being, exports will have to increase.&quot;</p>
