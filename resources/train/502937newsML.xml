<title>USA: Titan to re-enter exploration business.</title>
<headline>Titan to re-enter exploration business.</headline>
<dateline>FORTH WORTH, Texas 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Titan Resources Inc on Friday said it planned an acquisition that will mark its re-entry into the oil and natural gas exploration and development business.</p>
<p>The company said it signed a letter of intent to acquire a private concern based in Texas in exchange for an undisclosed number of Titan shares.</p>
<p>The oil and gas exploration company, whose identity was not disclosed, has significant land holdings outside the United States and several tracts in East Texas, Titan said.  </p>
<p>Titan said the acquisition was subject to reaching a formal agreement, which includes the examination of some normal due diligence issues.</p>
<p>Under the terms, Titan would move its head office to Forth Worth, Texas, from Bellevue, Wash., and two executives from the private corporation would be named to Titan's board, the company said.</p>
<p>Brent Nelson is expected to step down as president to allow the new officers to assume control of Titan's operations on a day-to-day basis, Titan said. Nelson will remain on the board as a director.</p>
<p>Titan said its confidentiality agreement with the company prevents it from releasing any further information until the parties reach a formal acquisition agreement.</p>
