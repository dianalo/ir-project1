<p>Thursday would have been the last day of classes before the summer break for pupils at the Raimundo Martinez Centeno high school in this tiny Caribbean town in eastern Venezuela.</p>
<p>But minutes before school bells rang on Wednesday to signal the end of the day, the school crashed to the ground in Venezuela's strongest earthquake in more than three decades. Limbs poked out of the bloodied rubble on Thursday morning and textbooks and broken desks lay scattered among the debris.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them were taking end of term exams,&quot; arts teacher Tomas Pantoja said as he tried to rescue a teenager with crippling wounds to his legs and arms. &quot;The building collapsed as though a bomb hit it,&quot; Pantoja said.</p>
<p>One student, Jhonny Delgado, said he escaped from the building through a hole in the rubble after sitting out the tremor, which lasted about 10 seconds. But rescue workers told anxious parents another 20 or 35 schoolchildren could still be trapped in the rubble of their old classrooms and library.</p>
<p>At least one teacher died after shielding two schoolgirls. More than 20 pupils are thought to have died among the 500 estimated to have been in the school when it was razed by the quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and struck at about 3:25 p.m. (1925 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the hurt were children and have lost their legs and arms after they were taken from the ruins and then given very rudimentary surgery,&quot; said Ramon Ward, director of Caricao's 30-bed Diego Carbonel hospital, which treated nearly 500 patients after the quake. &quot;Some died bleeding on their way to the hospital,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Mayor Miguel Vasquez said the agricultural town of 13,000, some 295 miles (470 km) east of the capital Caracas, had been completely destroyed by the quake; streets were riven by huge cracks and houses flattened.</p>
<p>But even though Caricao took the brunt of the quake, which killed at least 46 people and wounded hundreds throughout eastern Sucre state, little help has been able to get through. Roads are blocked, water supplies are cut and electricity lines are down.</p>
<p>The six staff at the hospital, which has no blood bank or X-ray machine, bemoaned the lack of other basic supplies, including electricity, and outside help. &quot;Most of the aid attempt has gone to Cumana, while here, which has been worst hurt, we're still waiting help,&quot; said one doctor. Cumana, capital of Sucre, lies 40 miles (60 km) west of Cariaco.</p>
<p>The hospital morgue only has space for two bodies. But amid the chaos, hospital staff said they had successfully delivered a baby on Wednesday night.</p>
