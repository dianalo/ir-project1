<p>Philippine shares slid for the third straight day on Friday, partly cutting into a steep two-day rally early in the week and leaving analysts predicting volatile trade for next week.</p>
<p>&quot;There're really not many fundamentals to warrant an upmove but what we would like to see is for the market to form a base. It's very touchy and it can go either way,&quot; said Raul Zamora, head of institutional sales at PCIB Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will be relatively soft. It's hard to predict because the volatility is so high. Half of the investors are saying sell while the other half say buy,&quot; said Corazon Guidote, head of Philippine equities at UBS Securities (East Asia) Ltd.</p>
<p>Local investors are expected to dominate the market next week with foreign fund managers likely to be preoccupied with the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on May 20, which will decide whether interest rates will be changed.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Securities analyst Ramon Adviento said the release of first quarter gross national product figures in the coming weeks would also be critical to the market.</p>
<p>The main index posted a sharp two-day gain of nearly seven percent beginning Monday from last Friday's 2605.65 close.</p>
<p>Traders termed the frenzied buying a technical rebound, led by oversold blue chips. The gains were followed by three consecutive days of losses. The main index closed 10.71 points or 0.40 percent lower at 2,671.39 on Friday.</p>
<p>Week-on-week, the main index rose 2.52 percent 65.74 points from the previous Friday's close.</p>
<p>Prior to the rally early this week, the Philippine equities market had been shaken by predictions of a property glut leading to a crash in the sector and dismal first quarter earnings of some blue chip companies.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see slight ups and downs next week but no substantial rallies. Still, we are maintaining the support of 2,500 to 2,450 in the near term and if the index breaks through that, then that's really very dangerous,&quot; said Jidgette Valenzuela, research manager at Lippo Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts said cellular phone company Pilipino Telephone Corp reflected the market's volatility as it lost as much as 1.10 pesos by midsession on Friday to touch a record low of 8.70 pesos ($0.33). It closed at 10 pesos.</p>
<p>($1=26.36 pesos)</p>
