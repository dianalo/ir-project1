<p>Police probing IRA guerrilla activities in the Irish Republic arrested four men and seized bomb detonating cord, police sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>RTE, the semi-state news network, quoted security sources as saying the cord was similar to fuse thought to have been used in Irish Republican Army attacks in Northern Ireland, the British capital, London, and Osnabruck in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of the ongoing investigations into the activities of subversives, a number of searches have been conducted by Garda (police) Specialist Units and local Gardai (police) in four counties,&quot; police said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;So far a quantity of what is believed to be improvised detonation cord was found. This is presently being examined at the Forensic Science Laboratory at Garda Headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of arrests have been made and the searches will continue,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>The detonating cord was made from surgical tubing packed with a mix of semtex - a powerful commercial explosive often used by IRA fighters - and petrol, RTE reported.</p>
<p>The IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire a year ago and relaunched a campaign against British rule over Northern Ireland with a wave of bombs in the English cities of London and Manchester.</p>
<p>It also bombed a British military base at Osnabruck and last October extended the campaign to Northern Ireland, which had been its main war zone until a truce in September 1994.</p>
<p>British security sources say that the guerrillas use the Irish Republic to store arms and give other logistical support to IRA fighters who have intensfied a campaign against British military personnnel north of the Irish border in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A week ago a British soldier was shot dead at a border checkpoint. The guerrillas made no admission but the IRA, which wants to oust British forces from the province, was widely blamed.</p>
