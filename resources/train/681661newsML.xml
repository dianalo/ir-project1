<title>HONG KONG: Shenzhen B shares end down on bank suspension.</title>

<p>Shenzhen's foreign currency B share index ended down in volatile trading on Monday due in part to the suspension of A share market giant Shenzhen Development Bank for unusual price movements, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index lost 0.88 point or 0.59 percent to 148.27 after hitting a high of 152.50. Turnover was HK$85 million, compared with HK$62 million last Friday.</p>
<p>The A share index inched up 0.43 point or 0.10 percent to 450.40, but off an intra-session high of 467.63 scored in the morning. Turnover was a heavy 14.5 billion yuan, against 9.3 billion yuan in the previous session.  </p>
<p>&quot;The A share market gave up much of its early gain in the afternoon after the Shenzhen Stock Exchange suspended trading in the bank for its volatile price movements,&quot; an analyst at China Guotai Securities said.</p>
<p>A Shenzhen stock exchange official said bank was suspended from trading due to &quot;abnormal&quot; price fluctuations, and trading in the stock would resume on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Trading in the bank had been suspended for five sessions until last Friday due to irregularities in the bank's share trading.  </p>
<p>Shenzhen Development ended up 10 percent on Friday due in part to optimism over its earnings outlook, brokers said.</p>
<p>The bank, considered the A share market leader due to its large-capitalisation and solid earnings record, extended gains on Monday, closing the morning session up 7.77 percent at 36.60 yuan on volume of 28 million shares.</p>
<p>It was the second most actively traded stock on Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Beijing securities authorities announced it would sack the bank's president He Yun after the bank was found to have used bank funds to trade in its own shares.  </p>
<p>Beijing also said it would confiscate about 90 million yuan in profits from the bank's illegal stock trading.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Development Bank, China's only bank with a domestic listing, led the bull-run in Shenzhen's A share market between January and May this year before giving up some gains due to the official investigation into its share trading.</p>
<p>The A share market gains on Monday were based on expectations that China was unlikely to announce new anti-speculation measures in the remaining days before Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Investors are going to stay on the sidelines early Tuesday to monitor the bank's performance,&quot; another analyst at a Chinese brokerage said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would produce downward pressure on the overall market if it falls sharply because it is so heavily index weighted,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>But fallout from Shenzhen Development Bank should be offset by euphoria in the final days before the Hong Kong handover and expectations the central government would not announce any harsh new measure to bring down share prices in the short term, brokers said.  </p>
<p>In the B share market, Jiangling Motors was the sharpest loser, falling HK$0.21 or 5.75 percent to HK$3.44.</p>
<p>Television tube maker SEG Co fell HK$0.45 or 5.56 percent to HK$7.65 to be the second sharpest loser in the B share market.</p>
