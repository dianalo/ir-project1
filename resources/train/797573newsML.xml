<p>Italy's debt market slumped back lower after a short-lived rally following U.S. economic data faltered as negative sentiment again took the upper hand on the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Italian BTPs focus was on the weakness of the dollar and the warning from the German Bundesbank that it was scrutinising a recent upturn in inflation and would not hesitate to tighten its monetary policy if warranted.</p>
<p>&quot;The T-bond rally after the data soon fizzled out and BTPs were back where they started around one full point lower,&quot; said one LIFFE trader.  </p>
<p>The U.S. data turned out better than expected with U.S. July retail sales up 0.6 percent compared with a forecast 0.7 percent, and July producer prices off 0.1 percent with a consensus forecast of up 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>Economists focused on the decline in the PPI which marked the seventh successive month to show a fall helping to allay fears of U.S. inflation and interest rate rises.</p>
<p>But T-bonds which rose around one full point on the data soon shrunk back and were now awaiting U.S. CPI data on Thursday to be convinced over the benign inflation outlook.  </p>
<p>Italian PPI and WPI figures for June published earlier today showed producer prices up an expected 1.6 percent year on year and WPI better than forecast showing a 0.3 percent yearly fall against an expected 0.2 percent rise.</p>
