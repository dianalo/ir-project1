<p>With a recent fatal heart attack in a post-office queue, stamp-mad Hong Kong has gone even crazier for the sticky symbols as Britain prepares to return the territory to China after more than 150 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>Mile-long queues for first-day issues are not unusual in this territory of 6.4 million people, but there has been a real stampede for stamps in the months before the June 30 handover.</p>
<p>The fad claimed its first death when a 71-year-old philatelist collapsed and died of a heart attack in the stampede to buy the last stock of Queen Elizabeth stamps.</p>
<p>Thousands of stamp fanciers also queued for a day at post offices across the territory in February to pick up the &quot;Year of the Ox&quot; commemorative stamps, the last Lunar New Year issue to include a motif of the British crown.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Lunar New Year stamps usually are the most popular, but I can't deny the fact that 1997 is contributing to some of the demand,&quot; said Aubrey Au, controller of posts.</p>
<p>EMBLEMS OF A FADING EMPIRE</p>
<p>The four-stamp set of colourful oxen is the eleventh in a series of 12 issues celebrating the Chinese Lunar Year cycle.</p>
<p>Wong Ming-kit waited six hours at the General Post Office in Hong Kong's Central District for a chance to add the series to a stamp collection he has been amassing for 30 of his 37 years.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm buying them partly because they are the Lunar New Year stamps and partly because they have the crown,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Au said 23 of Hong Kong's 125 post offices opened early to accommodate the rush.</p>
<p>Steven Chang, who waited in line for more than five hours, said the wait was worth it.</p>
<p>&quot;After I get the Year of the Ox, I will have 11 of the 12 signs,&quot; said Chang, who said he has been collecting for decades.</p>
<p>Sales of the final print of Hong Kong stamps bearing Queen Elizabeth's likeness and the first print of post-handover stamps featuring Hong Kong's skyline also have attracted crowds.</p>
<p>The British queen's face will disappear from Hong Kong mail forever on July 1.</p>
<p>PROFIT MOTIVE TEMPTS ALL - INCLUDING POST OFFICE CLERKS</p>
<p>Many people endure hours in line to collect stamps for their beauty and historical value, but in money-minded Hong Kong the prospect for profit also plays a key role.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Post Office currently is under investigation after allegations that workers at its Shatin branch rigged the sale of special stamps to speculators. The market value of the ill-gotten stamps is about HK$500,000 (US$64,100).</p>
<p>First-press issues of Year of the Ox stamps reportedly are selling at a 50 percent premium to their cost at issue.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Postmaster General Robert Footman, speaking to Reuters at Hong Kong's recent stamp exhibition, said the potential for profit is only one of the reasons Hong Kong people are wild about stamps.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a mixture of interests. Certainly the stamps have not lost value, but we are trying to build interest in the schools in stamp collecting as a hobby,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hobbyists were clearly in evidence at the stamp show, which attracted tens of thousands of visitors with a showing of rare stamps, scores of international stamp exhibitors and, more important, the lure of inexpensive souvenirs.</p>
<p>On offer were biscuit-box size replicas of the soon-to-be- scrapped British red post boxes, stamps of Hong Kong at night, stamps of Hong Kong in the 19th century, stamps of Hong Kong that are really holograms and other memorabilia.</p>
<p>The post boxes were hot items, and not because purchasers expected the tin toys to rocket in value.</p>
<p>&quot;I bought them for my children,&quot; said one man as he hurried away from line.</p>
<p>Lily Choy, a Hong Kong teacher, and student Agatha Lee, said they picked up a few of the post boxes and several sets of stamps to add to their 10-year-old stamp collections.</p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Philatelic Society was doing a brisk business in &quot;Action King&quot; stamps featuring Kung Fu film star Jackie Chan at HK$100 a pop.</p>
<p>Across the room at the sprawling Hong Kong Convention Centre, people waited for a chance to shell out HK$300 for a 24-carat gold stamp picturing Hong Kong's Olympic windsurfing champion Lee Lai-shan, better known as San-san.</p>
<p>CHINESE PRIDE</p>
<p>Pansy Ku, director of the Singapore gallery for Spink, a unit of British auctioneer Christies International, said collectables have grown in value in Asia as an increasingly affluent population tries to buy back its cultural heritage.</p>
<p>&quot;We see huge prices for Chinese ceramics and Indonesian paintings. Stamps and banknotes are in the same category because of the high prices and the enthusiasm,&quot; said Ku.</p>
<p>&quot;This is more the case in Hong Kong than in Singapore. It might be the temperament of Hong Kong people. They never do anything half way,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>But people buying novelty stamps in hopes of big gains probably will be disappointed, Ku said. Gold-plated issues like the San-san stamp rarely surge in value.</p>
<p>&quot;Stamps like that don't necessarily go up in value unless they are very rare. They really are only souvenirs,&quot; she said.</p>
