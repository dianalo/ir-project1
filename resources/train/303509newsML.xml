<headline>U.S. business confidence up in Q4-Conference Board.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-13</dateline>

<p>U.S. business confidence inched up in the final quarter of last year, according to a report released by The Conference Board on Monday.</p>
<p>The Board's Measure of Business Confidence closed at 54 in the fourth quarter of 1996, up one point from third quarter, the global research and business membership network said.</p>
<p>The barometer is based on a quarterly survey of about 200 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) representing a wide variety of industries.</p>
<p>A reading of more than 50 indicates that more responses are positive than negative.  </p>
<p>Nearly 45 percent of CEOs say the economy has improved during the last six months compared with less than 43 percent in the previous quarter, the report said.</p>
<p>CEOs are also more positive about conditions in their own industries as almost 45 percent said conditions are better compared with less than 40 percent in the third quarter, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;But chief executives are clearly cautious about the short-term outlook,&quot; said Lynn Franco, associate director of the Board's Consumer Research Center.  </p>
<p>&quot;Only about one-fifth of business executives now anticipate accelerating economic growth in the next six months, down from more than one-fourth in the third quarter,&quot; Franco said.</p>
<p>The majority of CEOs surveyed anticipate changes in their firms' selling prices in 1997, with almost 30 percent expecting increases of more than 6.0 percent, the report said.</p>
<p>By contrast, less than 10.0 percent plan decreases, a dramatic decline from last year's 25 percent, the report said.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of business leaders expect to boost prices up to 5.0 percent in 1997, up from last year's reading of almost 50 percent, according to The Conference Board.  </p>
<p>The average firm plans a price increase of 3.0 percent, up from last year's forecast of 2.1 percent, the report said.</p>
<p>Largest price hikes are expected in the mining industry, where price increases of 9.6 percent are anticipated, the report said.</p>
<p>Executives in the durables sector anticipate the smallest price increases, a rise of 0.8 percent, according to The Conference Board report.</p>
