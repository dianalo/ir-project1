<p>Actor Marcello Mastroianni, Italy's quintessential Latin Lover and master interpreter of Federico Fellini's films, died at his home in Paris on Thursday, aged 72.</p>
<p>Rome's Trevi Fountain, the setting for Mastroianni's most memorable cinematic scene in Fellini's &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, stopped flowing in a mark of respect and tributes abounded as Italy and the film world mourned the passing of a favourite son.</p>
<p>Friends said he had had cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a great actor because he was always himself,&quot; said Swedish actress Anita Ekberg, whose romp with the young Mastroianni in the waters of the Trevi Fountain in &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; in 1960 is one of cinema's indelible images.</p>
<p>In a surreal scene evocative of Fellini's work, the city of Rome switched off the fountain in a tribute to Mastroianni.</p>
<p>The fountain's lights were doused and men standing on the roof of the imposing Baroque monument, built into the side of a building, unfurled two black cloth banners.</p>
<p>Mastroianni's widow, Flora Carabella, broke down in tears as a musician standing beside the fountain performed the eerie theme of Fellini's film &quot;8 1/2&quot; on a recorder.</p>
<p>&quot;We followed his career, his life. He was our generation,&quot; said Roman Sergio Sagnotti, 67, at the fountain. &quot;He was a great personality, not only a great actor but a great human being.&quot;</p>
<p>His Italian agent Giovanna Cau said Mastroianni passed away at his Paris flat on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Mastroianni's former companion, French actress Catherine Deneuve, their daughter Chiara and actor Michel Piccoli were at his side when he died, media said. His daughter Barbara from his marriage to Carabella was also present, Cau said.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac called Mastroianni's death &quot;an enormous loss&quot; while tearful fans wept outside the Paris flat where he died.</p>
<p>&quot;He was the most French of all Italian actors,&quot; said Prime Minister Alain Juppe, saying his blend of seduction, humour and talent made him &quot;an exceptional personality of the second half of the century&quot;.</p>
<p>In some 160 films, starring alongside many of cinema's most beautiful women, Mastroianni became an enduring symbol of suave Latin sex appeal while never losing a reputation for modesty.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was a kid...I had a chest that looked like a basket and two bird's legs,&quot; Mastroianni once said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not handsome and I never have been.&quot;</p>
<p>Mastroianni's body was to be returned to Rome on Friday after a service in Paris. Officials said he would be laid in state at Rome's city hall on the Capitoline Hill from Saturday afternoon until his funeral service in Rome on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Marcello was the sweetest, nicest, most light-hearted actor, a great friend who I will miss a lot,&quot; said actress Monica Vitti, who starred with Mastroianni in Michelangelo Antonioni's 1961 film &quot;The Night&quot; among others.</p>
<p>Apart from &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, Mastroianni perhaps will be best remembered for films in which he starred with Sophia Loren such as &quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot;, &quot;The Priest's Wife&quot;, &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Sunflowers&quot; and &quot;A Special Day&quot;.</p>
<p>Mastroianni, who shunned publicity and rarely granted interviews, was born to peasant parents on September 28, 1924, at Fontana Liri, a mountain hamlet southeast of Rome.</p>
<p>When he was still a boy the family moved to the northern industrial city of Turin and then to Rome, where Marcello earned a degree in surveying and planned to become an architect.</p>
<p>At 19, he was picked up by Nazi troops who had occupied Rome and sent to a forced labour camp in northern Italy. He escaped to Venice, where he drew pictures of the lagoon city's landmarks and sold them to tourists for food.</p>
<p>After the war he returned to Rome, where he worked as a clerk in the accounting department of the British Eagle-Lion film company and in the evenings began acting with a Rome University theatrical company.</p>
<p>In 1947 he made his screen debut in the Italian version of &quot;Les Miserables&quot; and a year later made his stage debut in a play which starred Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife.</p>
<p>It was a meeting that changed his life but, said his friends, not his ways.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a man who never once made a television advert,&quot; said Italian journalist Enzo Biagi, a friend who said Mastroianni had told him recently that he had cancer. &quot;That was the way he was, nice, normal, not a diva at all.&quot;</p>
