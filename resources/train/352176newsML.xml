<p>The body of a woman was found on Monday in Jack Kevorkian's van parked outside a Michigan medical examiner's office, two hours after the body of another woman was dropped off at a hospital, police said.</p>
<p>Lt. Robert Smith of the Oakland County Sheriff's Department said the body of an unidentified white female was discovered in Kevorkian's battered 1968 Volkswagen van at about 2:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) Monday, but detectives were still trying to determine whether Kevorkian was directly involved.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not reached any conclusion on that yet,&quot; Smith said. &quot;I can confirm it's Dr. Kevorkian's van.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevorkian has used the van to drop off several bodies in the past. The 68-year-old retired pathologist has attended 45 known suicides since 1990.</p>
<p>Kevorkian also has been known to drop off bodies at Pontiac Osteopathic Hosptial. The body of a 42-year-old New Jersey woman was brought to the hospital's emergency room about 12:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) on Monday by a woman who identified herself as a friend.</p>
<p>&quot;She denied any connection with Dr. Kevorkian at the time,&quot; said Dr. Robert Aranosian, director of emergency. &quot;Whether or not this turns out to be an assisted suicide, we don't know yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Aranosian said the woman told emergency room doctors that she was driving around and her friend stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger, declined to discuss the incidents, saying only, &quot;I don't have any comment at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevorkian has taken a break from his assisted suicide activities in recent months, due largely to new charges that were filed against him in two Michigan counties. Last month, however, Oakland County's new prosecutor, David Gorcyca, dropped 19 criminal charges against Kevorkian brought last year by Richard Thompson, who lost a primary election to Gorcyca.</p>
<p>At the time, Gorcyca said it would be a waste of taxpayer money to prosecute Kevorkian without an explicit state statute banning assisted suicide. Kevorkian has been acquitted in three trials since 1994.</p>
<p>But Kevorkian is still expected to stand trial in rural Ionia County, Mich., sometime this spring, on assisted sucide charges in the death of a 54-year-old woman. A condition of his bond in the case was to refrain from participating in further suicides.</p>
