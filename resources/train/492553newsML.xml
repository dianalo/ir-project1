<p>Hit by slumping prices of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, two of South Korea's three chipmakers are increasing production of 64-megabit DRAMS, company officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>An LG Semicon Co spokesman said the company would raise its 64-megabit DRAM output to one million units a month by the third quarter of this year, from 150,000. The company earlier said it would increase production in the first half.</p>
<p>&quot;With the 16-megabit DRAM chips, we cannot expect good profit margins. But the 64-megabit DRAM will be more popular in the end of this year,&quot; said spokesman Han Dong-moon of LG Semicon.  </p>
<p>Hyundai Electronics said it would raise its monthly output of 64-megabit DRAMs to 500,000 a month in the first half of the year and to three million a month by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Bang Min-ho of Hyundai Electronics, an affiliate of the Hyundai Group, said the company wanted to boost its global market share by increasing its 64-megabit DRAM production.</p>
<p>But South Korea's largest chipmaker, Samsung Electronics, said it had no immediate plan to raise its monthly production of 64-megabit DRAMs beyond its current one million.  </p>
<p>A Samsung Electronics spokesman denied local newspaper reports that the company would increase its monthly 64-megabit DRAM production to two million units by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Company officials said the unit price for 64-megabit DRAMs currently ranges between $50 and $54, compared to $10 for 16-megabit DRAMs. Semiconductors, including memory chips, are South Korea's single largest export item.</p>
