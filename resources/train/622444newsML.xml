<p>The Czech crown was stable in early trade on Wednesday and dealers said the market was focused on talks aimed at finalising a government reshuffle.</p>
<p>The crown stood at 19.411 against the mark at 0910 GMT, little changed from opening levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The Czech crown is waiting for what will happen on the political side of things,&quot; said trader Milan Vavra of Komercni Banka. &quot;Political destabilisation is the most important thing for foreign investors so nobody is doing a lot of business in foreign exchange,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus earlier cancelled a trip to the Netherlands in order to continue talks with partners in his three-party centre-right coalition on restructuring the cabinet. The government also cancelled its regular Wednesday meeting.</p>
<p>The coalition leaders agreed last week to make changes in the cabinet after a sharp drop in its popularity spurred by an economic downturn and widespread reports of financial crime.</p>
<p>&quot;If a new government will not be established in the near future, I expect that the Czech crown will go lower again,&quot; said Vavra.</p>
<p>The central bank, from Tuesday, scrapped the bands within which the crown fluctuated against a mark/dollar basket, allowing the currency to float.</p>
<p>As expected, it depreciated significantly. It stands at about 10.8 percent weaker than the old central parity of the basket, compared with about -2.8 percent before the bands were scrapped.</p>
