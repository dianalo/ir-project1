<headline>Malaysia says wants to end row with Singapore.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-03-28</dateline>

<p>Malaysia said on Friday it wanted to end a row with neighbouring Singapore but said it needed time and effort to rebuild ties due to the &quot;lack of insight&quot; and &quot;earnestness&quot; among some Singaporean leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;We reaffirm that we seek to normalise relations with Singapore,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement disributed through the national news agency Bernama.</p>
<p>&quot;However, such relations are a partnership. It is the quality of the partnership that has been brought into question. Naturally it will take time and effort on both sides to re-establish previous levels of confidence,&quot; Anwar said.</p>
<p>His statement came after three weeks of recriminations caused by Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's description of the south Malaysian state of Johor, which borders Singapore, as notorious for crime.</p>
<p>Anwar said the Malaysian cabinet accepted Lee's apology. But he added: &quot;Good neighbourly relations are built upon the principle of reciprocity, nurtured by mutual understanding and respect for one another.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We therefore regret that some members of the Singapore government seem to lack insight and earnestness, even appear to trivialise what is at issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Anwar, replying to questions from reporters, said there were suggestions from the cabinet about freezing ties at its meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;But I have said notwithstanding all these expressions of concern, or disappointment, the cabinet reaffirmed its earlier decision to normalise relations with Singapore,&quot; Bernama quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Malaysian media reported that the Cabinet on Wednesday had decided to freeze all new bilateral dealings with Singapore.</p>
<p>Although Malaysian ministers later denied that ties would be frozen, Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin Chik said cultural and sporting links with Singapore would be suspended.</p>
<p>Anwar did not refer to any punitive actions against Singapore in his statement.</p>
<p>The row erupted after Lee, in a court affidavit leaked to the Malaysian press, described the southern state of Johor as a &quot;notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings&quot;.</p>
<p>Lee apologised and instructed his lawyer to ask the court to delete the remarks from a deposition in a libel suit against a Singaporean opposition politician who fled to Johor after saying he had received death threats in Singapore.</p>
