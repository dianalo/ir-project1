<p>Self-proclaimed president Laurent Kabila, his government confronted by two successive days of student protests, says elections in the new Democratic Republic of Congo will have to wait for two years.</p>
<p>Kabila, whose forces drove out Zaire dictator Mobutu Sese Seko one week ago after a whirlwind seven-month offensive, made the comment during a rare public appearance in the capital Kinshasa on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We must prepare to have elections,&quot; Kabila told U.S.-based television network CNN during a little-publicised visit to a Kinshasa hospital, noting that there would be a &quot;democratic election after (a) two years transitional period&quot;.</p>
<p>Western countries joined other nations in welcoming the fall of Mobutu and his entourage, who were widely accused of pillaging what is potentially one of Africa's richest nations and of amassing personal fortunes.</p>
<p>But they have conditioned their support for Kabila on the formation of a broad based government to steer Africa's third largest country to multi-party elections -- a transition Mobutu reluctantly agreed to and then failed to implement.</p>
<p>Troops in Kinshasa fired in the air on Saturday to break up a march by about 1,000 students protesting against Kabila's government and the presence of Tutsi soldiers from Rwanda and other eastern neighbours of what used to be Zaire.</p>
<p>Kabila's Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Congo denies the presence of foreign troops in his forces.</p>
<p>Kabila, who arrived in Kinshasa on Tuesday, has named a 13 member government, including four non-Alliance members, saying that more posts will be filled shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a broad-based government,&quot; he said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kabila and his administration have won backing from Nelson Mandela's South Africa for progress so far.</p>
<p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who played a key role in attempts to ensure a peaceful transition, said on Friday Congo could not afford to rush into elections and a fair poll would be difficult to achieve soon after taking power.</p>
<p>Kabila's administration accused reactionary political forces linked to the ousted Mobutu regime for Kinshasa street protests and said demonstrations were technically banned.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle demonstrations have not been permitted in all parts of the country that we have liberated in this period of consolidation, but we are very tolerant,&quot; Information Minister Raphael Ghenda told Reuters.</p>
<p>But many in Kinshasa express private disappointment Kabila found no place in the government for Etienne Tshisekedi, the veteran leader of the internal political opposition to Mobutu.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, who has a strong following in the city, claims the job of prime minister -- a post to which he was elected in 1992 by a sovereign national conference but from which Mobutu sacked him. The Alliance says there will be no prime minister.</p>
<p>Residents of Mbuji-Mayi, the diamond mining capital of Tshisekedi's Kasai homeland, reported a protest there on Friday.</p>
<p>Mobutu, weakened by cancer, arrived in Morocco on Friday from Togo but an official in Rabat said on Saturday he was expected to go on to France early next month.</p>
<p>Transport Minister Henri Mova, meanwhile, said regular flights to and from Kinshasa could restart by Tuesday.</p>
