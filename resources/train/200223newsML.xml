<p>Austrian President Thomas Klestil, readmitted to hospital with a pulmonary embolism, is battling a chronic lung inflammation that could restrict his future activities, a top U.S. doctor said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Baffled Austrian physicians called in Thomas Medsger, an expert in connective tissue disease from the University of Philadelphia, after Klestil struggled for breath during a television interview last Thursday.</p>
<p>He was speaking in public for the first time since mid-September when he spent several days hooked up to an artificial respirator.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to say whether the president will be able to return to all his official duties...but I am optimistic,&quot; Medsger told Austrian radio.</p>
<p>&quot;Many patients return to virtually normal physical activity after a bout of connective tissue disease, regardless of whether that inflammation affects the joints, the lungs, kidneys or some other location,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Medsger added that there was no evidence that Klestil's organs were affected by the disease, which is evident in his joints and lungs. He said the embolism, or blood clot on the lung which can be potentially fatal, was not linked with the long-standing inflammation.</p>
<p>Doctors at Vienna general hospital, where Klestil is being treated, did not set a date for his release.</p>
<p>Klestil became president in 1992 and helped restore Austria's image abroad after his predecessor Kurt Waldheim's period in office was overshadowed by his Nazi past.</p>
<p>Klestil briefly passed his responsibilities to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in September after falling unconscious for three days, but he officially resumed his duties when he was released from hospital two weeks later.</p>
