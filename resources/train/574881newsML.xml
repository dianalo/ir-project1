<headline>German SPD leaders fall for bogus Blair party.</headline>

<p>Three leading German politicians accepted a bogus &quot;invitation&quot; to an election victory party for British Prime Minister Tony Blair that was to take place on Sunday in London, a German satirical magazine said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based &quot;Titanic&quot; magazine said Oskar Lafontaine, chairman of the Social Democrats (SPD), along with SPD leaders Gerhard Schroeder and Rudolf Scharping agreed by telephone to attend the non-existent party.</p>
<p>A Titanic reporter called Martin Sonneborn, speaking English, posed as &quot;Mr. Burlington, head of the celebration committee of the Labour Party,&quot; the magazine said.</p>
<p>&quot;All three said they would be delighted to attend,&quot; Titanic said. The SPD even put out a press release last week saying Lafontaine would attend the party, but withdrew it a day later.</p>
<p>The magazine said all three were asked to bring an instrument in order to take part in &quot;a victory jam session&quot; with Blair, who would play an electric guitar, and Bill Clinton, who they were told would bring his saxophone.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't play anything,&quot; Schroeder told the magazine. &quot;I can't even sing.&quot; But he added: &quot;I will come gladly, very gladly. I like you guys.&quot;</p>
<p>Gerhard Schroeder, premier of the state of Lower Saxony, is a top candidate to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next year's general elections.</p>
<p>Scharping, whom Kohl defeated in 1994, said he would bring a percussion instrument to play. But Scharping insisted that he be allowed to play in the front row next to Blair because Scharping is &quot;president of the Social Democrats of Europe.&quot;</p>
