<p>South Korean stocks closed higher on Saturday on late bargain hunting as investors believed government steps would limit the impact from the financial failure of Hanbo Steel, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said expectations of an expansion of the foreign stock ownership limit also helped buying.</p>
<p>The composite index ended 5.55 points higher at 685.11.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hanbo issue will linger for the time being. But it seems to be shadowed by hopes of fund inflows from foreigners,&quot; said Chang Keun-ho, a broker at Daishin Securities.</p>
<p>The government has said the ceiling for foreign investment would be raised to 23 percent this year from 20 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The government's moves to minimise the adverse effect of Hanbo failure appear to have improved sentiment,&quot; said Kim Heung-shik of Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea said it pumped in one trillion won into commercial banks to ease a credit squeeze caused by Hanbo's crisis.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said on Friday the central bank would also provide emergency operating funds to Hanbo's suppliers and subcontractors.</p>
<p>Hanbo Steel defauled on payments of more than five billion won worth of promissory notes on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Half-day trade volume totalled 22.4 million shares, compared with 35.49 million on Friday.</p>
<p>Advancers outpaced retreaters 581 to 191 with 85 unchanged.</p>
