<p>Spanish hotel chain Sol Melia aims to increase its net profits by 20 percent a year on a sustained basis, financial director Oscar Ruiz said.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective consists of raising net profits by 20 percent annually on a sustained basis,&quot; Ruiz told financial daily Expansion in an interview published on Monday.</p>
<p>To do so, the company is raising the number of hotels under management and taking advantage of different hotel cycles on the four continents it conducts business, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We want the market to get used to expecting a dividend of between 25 and 35 percent,&quot; Ruiz said.</p>
<p>The financing for growth is drawn solely from company means.</p>
<p>&quot;In our balance sheet we don't have even a peseta of debt and financing is done with equity capital,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Liquid assets that build are put in Treasury bills and in short-term deposits. With these funds, investments are made in hotels the group manages.</p>
<p>&quot;These assets represent some 10 billion pesetas and, if we didn't make any investments, they would grow by five billion pesetas by year end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When asked how the group managed currency flows, Ruiz said Sol Melia's dollar, dollar-tied, and mark income represents some 30 percent of the total -- 13 billion in 1996 -- and compensates for peseta cycles.  </p>
<p>Ruiz said Europe's economic and monetary union would have an essentially positive effect, as it would give stability by eliminating market uncertainties and will ease the hiring of tour operators.</p>
