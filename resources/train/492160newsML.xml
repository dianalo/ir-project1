<title>NETHERLANDS: Stork quits Fokker restart talks.</title>
<headline>Stork quits Fokker restart talks.</headline>

<p>Engineering and industrial services group Stork NV said on Monday it was no longer bound to a memorandum of understanding on an attempted restart of bankrupt aircraft maker Fokker.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fokker administrators have now concluded that any chance of a restart seems definitively off the cards,&quot; Stork said in a statement.</p>
<p>In March, the Fokker administrators said they, the Dutch state, Stork and industrial investment group Deleye Investment had agreed on a common approach for negotiations with the Malaysian government on a relaunch of Fokker.  </p>
<p>Stork said Malaysia's state investment group Khazanah Nasional Berhad was not willing to shoulder its obligations together with the Dutch partners before a due diligence was fully completed.</p>
<p>It added that the Dutch government and Deleye Investment had not formally reacted to this and wanted to study the present situation first.</p>
<p>But Stork said the Fokker administrators and its management team thought the minimal infrastructure which Fokker needs for a successful restart was no longer there.  </p>
<p>Fokker has almost completed building its last three aircraft and many of its remaining employees have left in the past weeks, it added.</p>
<p>Earlier today, a Stork spokesman said there were problems of a financial nature in the relaunch negotiations but he said media reports Stork had pulled out of the talks were premature.</p>
<p>Fokker went bankrupt last year when German majority shareholder Daimler Benz cut the company's financial lifeline, saying it could no longer bear the firm's huge losses.</p>
<p>The &quot;Malaysian solution&quot; was seen as the last chance of a rebirth of the Netherlands' only aviation group.</p>
