<p>Iran's leading presidential candidates on Wednesday pledged to attract foreign investment and improve the performance of the country's non-oil sector.</p>
<p>But a leading candidate, Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, said that Iran would in the future turn to Asia for its trade partners over the West after a German court ruled that Iran's leaders had ordered political killings abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Westerners and Europeans proved during the latest affair that they are not reliable and they have lost their credibility. We have to turn to Asia for joint ventures. For example, India, China and Russia,&quot; Nateq-Nouri said.</p>
<p>The European Union, a major trade partner with Iran, withdrew its envoys from Tehran after a Berlin court ruling in April implicating Iran's leadership in the 1992 killings of Kurdish dissidents in Germany. Iran denied the accusations.</p>
<p>In a nationwide televised debate, Nateq-Nouri and former minister of culture Mohammad Khatami -- the leading candidates for Friday's vote -- supported improving the oil-dependent economy by boosting non-oil exports, improving domestic output and clarifying regulations on foreign and domestic investment.</p>
<p>Iran's economy has suffered in recent years from a fall in non-oil exports and foreign investors have shown reluctance to commit themselves to the country because of political tensions between Tehran and Washington and also because of the lack of a clear fiscal and regulatory regime.</p>
<p>Khatami, seen as the main challenger to Nateq-Nouri as the successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said foreign investment was needed for economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investment is needed...Foreign investment can supplement our domestic efforts in revitalising the economy. I agree with foreign investment,&quot; said Khatami, who is backed by pro-Rafsanjani centrists and left-wing Islamists.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri, who is close to Iran's traditional bazaar merchants, also supported foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investment doesn't conflict with Islamic values. We should have suitable regulations to ease investments,&quot; Nateq-Nouri, a conservative cleric, said.</p>
<p>He also stressed the need to boost non-oil exports because the country could not rely on oil income, projected to total an annual $18 billion, past the year 2010.</p>
<p>Iran's main non-oil exports are Persian carpets and pistachios.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1389 (2010) we won't have any oil income...Our future life and independence depends on non-oil exports. It is a priority,&quot; said Khatami in a televised question and answer session by the four candidates running in the election.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri said that currency restrictions would be lifted on the carpet industry to increase exports and that Iran should export more refined oil products rather than just crude oil.</p>
<p>&quot;We squeezed the exports so much that it was about to suffocate. This was the simplest way to control the exchange rate,&quot; Nateq-Nouri said.</p>
<p>Iran had dropped from being the world's number one carpet exporter to eighteenth, a situation that had to be reversed as the carpet industry provided livelihood for seven million people in Iran, he said.</p>
