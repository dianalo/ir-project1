<title>DENMARK: Legal problems could delay Danish Maastricht case.</title>

<p>Procedural delays could put back the planned May start of a High Court suit by 10 Danes challenging the legality of Denmark's European Union (EU) membership, a government lawyer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The date for the final submission of the group's deposition has been postponed until March 6 from February 28. I do not know if this will affect the timing of the start of the case,&quot; state defence lawyer Karsten Hagen-Soerensen told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said technical problems on the plantiffs' side caused the extension of the deadline.</p>
<p>In November the group, which calls itself the Constitution Committee, suffered a setback when court authorities turned down its request to have confidential government documents brought in evidence.</p>
<p>The rebuff followed a preliminary High Court hearing to set the boundaries for a legal challenge by the non-partisan Constitution Committee which claims that since joining the EU in 1973 Denmark has ceded national authority to European institutions in breach of its own constitution.</p>
<p>A second request for access to official documents is still being studied by the authorities and a ruling is expected next month.</p>
<p>The Constitution Committee is to open separate legal proceedings next month, seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against the November document ruling.</p>
<p>Legal experts see the ban on bringing classified state documents as evidence as limiting the scope of the trial and strengthening the government's chances of victory.</p>
<p>Defeat could oblige Denmark to renegotiate its EU treaties from scratch or to try to amend the constitution, a complex operation requiring a general election and a referendum.</p>
<p>Danes, traditionally cool toward European integration, rejected the Maastricht Treaty outright in a 1992 referendum.</p>
<p>Voters grudgingly approved the treaty the following year on condition that Denmark opt out of economic and monetary union and joint defence, policing and citizenship arrangements. --Chris Follett, Copenhagen newsroom +45-33969652</p>
