<title>UK: IPE Brent still lower on heating oil profit-taking.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent still lower on heating oil profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-27</dateline>

<p>IPE Brent crude continued to ease on the back of weaker heating oil prices in New York, traders said.</p>
<p>Nov Brent was 18 cents off at $22.75 per barrel at 1530 GMT having opened just four cents lower.</p>
<p>Gas oil, however, stabilised at the lower levels with Oct $4.75 a tonne lower at $227.00, around its level for much of the day, after hitting five-year highs on Thursday.</p>
<p>One trader saw Brent support at between $22.50 and $22.60 and gas oil support at $223.00/50. He said he would be looking for new highs next week.  </p>
<p>Another trader saw initial Brent support at $22.63 with further support at $22.39.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw heating oil somewhat over-extended on the upside,&quot; this trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Having made some very strong moves to the upside recently we saw it as overbought. (In London) We're seeing a little bit of a retracement. If prompt (heating oil) slips under 70 cents, this might put more pressure on gas oil.</p>
<p>&quot;For next week I see nothing untoward developing as yet. We have been quite constructive on heating oil going back to June and still there's a lot of bulls around,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally there is a lot of strength in the market because of (low) distillate stocks. But there is also a lot of speculative money around and a lot of length in the market, so it's not all one way.</p>
<p>&quot;But overall it's been an exceptional bull move and I see nothing as yet to suggest that it's going to go strongly into reverse.&quot;</p>
