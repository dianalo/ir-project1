<p>A Moscow court has sentenced a former Russian diplomat to seven years hard labour for spying for the United States, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said Vasily Makarov was recruited by Washington's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1976 in Bolivia. Tass said he was found guilty of espionage at a trial last month but the details have only just been made public. The news came a day after another Russian was jailed for 10 years for spying for Britain.  </p>
<p>After his recruitment, Makarov worked for the CIA until his return to Moscow in 1979 and then again in Spain from 1989, Tass said. He received more than $20,000 for his espionage work, it said.</p>
<p>Tass said the court's sentence, meted out on June 19, was relatively mild because of Makarov's &quot;candid repentance, his full acceptance of his guilt and his active cooperation with the investigation&quot;. The court could not be reached for details.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Russia's Supreme Court sentenced one-time Russian company manager Vadim Sintsov to 10 years hard labour after he pleaded guilty to providing British agents with information on the Russian arms industry.</p>
<p>Sintsov also received a lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years for &quot;cooperating with the court&quot;.</p>
