<headline>Former French PM calls for free-market policies.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>French ex-prime minister Edouard Balladur has urged the centre-right government to shift to free market policies if it wins a snap election, saying this would restart growth, cut unemployment and guarantee welfare.</p>
<p>&quot;France must make a clearer shift in a liberal direction in its economic and social policies,&quot; Balladur said in an interview with the daily Le Figaro published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>France goes to the polls on May 25 and June 1.</p>
<p>&quot;This means less spending, smaller deficits, lower taxes, more contracts, more dialogue, more freedom, more suppleness. But it is totally false to say a policy of economic freedom is one of less social protection,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Balladur was prime minister from 1993 to 1995, when he lost a bid for the presidency to conservative rival Jacques Chirac and was replaced by Chirac ally Prime Minister Alain Juppe.</p>
<p>Former finance minister Alain Madelin, who was sacked by Juppe in August 1995 for espousing free-market reforms, said at a campaign rally on Monday night that France needed a new momentum towards freedom.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'elan' of freedom, of freedom for companies and freedom of work to find a job,&quot; he told supporters in the Paris suburb of Asnieres.</p>
<p>&quot;The elan of freedom to reform the state, to reinforce social cohesion and discover what the president of the republic called the living social model.&quot;</p>
<p>Madelin carefully avoided using words such as &quot;flexibility&quot; and &quot;liberalism&quot; that are seen in France as the watchwords of an uncaring brand of capitalism with less social protection.</p>
<p>Balladur also shaded his words and stayed away from a call for increased labour market flexibility.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialists have accused the ruling centre-right majority of moving toward &quot;harsh capitalism&quot; and planning a new round of economic austerity so France can qualify for a single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Juppe has denied the charge and said the coalition will stick to steady, gradual economic reforms.</p>
<p>Balladur said he was in favour of a single European currency because it would support economic growth, but that it was foolish to focus only on figures when trying to respect the economic criteria to qualify.</p>
<p>He said France had to go further in cutting deficits, spending and taxes to liberate a stronger entrepreneurial spirit and more economic dynamism.</p>
<p>He said public deficits must be cut to two percent of gross domestic product in five years. France's public deficits were 4.2 percent of GDP in 1996 with economic growth of 1.3 percent. Under the criteria for a single currency, the deficit is meant to be three percent or less in 1997.</p>
