<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will use any meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to restart implementation of Palestinian self-rule, PLO officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Anything short of implementation of agreements stalled since Netanyahu took office in June, would make it difficult &quot;to quell the spirit of the renewed Palestinian uprising against Israelis&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Netanyahu telephoned Arafat from Germany and asked to meet him upon his return later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Israeli troops have killed 40 Palestinians and Palestinian forces have killed 11 Israelis in two days of clashes sparked by the opening of an Israeli tunnel in Arab east Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The President has not given Netanyahu a response yet, but the Americans, seeking calm, are urging Arafat to meet him,&quot; one one official said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are contacts between the two sides and I believe the meeting could take place tonight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>PLO officials believe Arafat is in a strong position and enjoyed Arab and international support after the clashes to put pressure on Netanyahu.</p>
<p>PLO officials said the U.S. and Europe were keen to see an end to the battles, but Arafat wants an extension of the self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza as agreed under the 1993 Oslo accord.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said he is opposed to trading occupied Arab land for peace. He has yet to implement an accord agreed upon by the previous government to redeploy Israeli troops from the West Bank city of Hebron</p>
<p>&quot;We do not object to meetings, but these meetings have to lead to implementation of the peace agreements, and to a halt of Israeli violations practised against our holy sites and our people's rights,&quot; said Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, general secretary of the Palestinian presidency.</p>
<p>Another PLO official said: &quot;Arafat will not accept now photo opportunities, or verbal promises or deferring issues to unauthorised committees.&quot;</p>
