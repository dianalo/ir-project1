<p>Precious metal prices with the exception of silver edged higher on Monday afternoon aided by the weaker dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>Earlier dealers put the day's likely gold range at $351.00-$353.00 pending a breakout which they said go in either direction.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $353.05 per ounce after $352.45 in the morning and $353.30 on Friday afternoon which climaxed a steady fund-led short covering recovery from the 3-3/4 year low fix of $336.90 struck on February 12.</p>
<p>The dollar's retreat to below 122 yen encouraged Japanese buying earlier and assisted in taking platinum to its fix of $373.00, its highest since December 23, 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some selling in both platinum and palladium earlier but a combination of the stronger yen and continuing confusion about the resumption of Russian exports to Japan turned that round,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Part of the interest in platinum came from investment funds which had been active buyers against the 1997 Russia-Japan supply negotiations being delayed this year.</p>
<p>They were also involved in platinum-gold spread plays which took the premium of platinum over gold to over $25.00 last week.</p>
<p>A Russian trade representative said today that platinum group metal exports would be much lower in 1997 than 1996 and that no palladium would be exported to Japan in March.</p>
<p>The official  Y. F. Zhigulov could not give a date for the delayed talks with Japan and was unable to confirm recent comments that deliveries would begin in April.</p>
<p>By 1500 GMT platinum was trading at $373.00/$374.00 off an intraday high bid of $373.80 while palladium was indicated at $137.75/$138.75 down from a intraday high bid of $139.50.</p>
<p>The prices compared with Friday's closes of $369.00/$370.00 and $135.75/$136.75 respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;As well as the questions about supply, there are good signs that industrial demand for these metals will pick up this year after being weak in 1996,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Figures released from Japan's Financial Ministry showed palladium imports last December were down 29.2 percent on the same month in 1995 while platinum imports increased 2.4 percent comparing the same two months.</p>
<p>Silver was unchanged to slightly lower most of the day and at 1520 GMT was indicated at $5.20/$5.22, down two cents.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was consolidating after rising on gold-silver ratio plays and physical demand.</p>
