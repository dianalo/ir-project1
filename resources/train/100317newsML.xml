<p>Traders said lower Bombay Stock Exchange trends had a dampening affect on the share prices in Delhi. The Bombay sensex closed 98.41 points, or 3.17 percent, down at 3002.86.</p>
<p>&quot;Market was full of different rumours on former prime minister Rao's case which was up for hearing in the Delhi High court today,&quot; said Suresh Aggarwal of brokers Jaimata Securities.</p>
