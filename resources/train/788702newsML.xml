<p>The Teamsters union and United Parcel Service went back to the bargaining table Thursday but showed few signs that the strike crippling the nation's largest package delivery company would end soon.</p>
<p>After eight hours of closed-door talks, the union issued a statement saying UPS had &quot;made it clear that it is still not prepared to reach an agreement that provides major progress on wages and pensions, full-time jobs, contracting, and job safety and health.&quot;</p>
<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey urged union members to keep up pressure on the company &quot;this weekend, next week, and for as long as it takes.&quot;</p>
<p>Carey walked out of talks with UPS and called a strike at midnight EDT on Monday after UPS refused Teamster contract demands, including the conversion of part-time jobs into full-time positions.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to resume negotiations with the help of a federal mediator Thursday, but details about the nature of the talks were not forthcoming.</p>
<p>Entering the talks, Carey said he would be looking for signs of flexibility from UPS managers.</p>
<p>&quot;We're making progress, I'll stay to the weekend, whatever is necessary, but if it's just a smokescreen, we're out of here,&quot; Carey told reporters.</p>
<p>UPS Chairman James Kelly said he welcomed the opportunity to talk but repeated his call for the Teamsters to put UPS' contract offer to the 185,000 striking union members for a vote.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have a last, best and final offer on the table,&quot; Kelly told reporters as he went into the talks. &quot;We are perplexed and don't understand why the Teamsters won't let us send that out to our people.&quot;</p>
<p>Federal mediator John Calhoun Wells tried to deflate hopes for a quick settlement, noting that the talks were mainly logistical rather than a formal negotiating session.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's very important that we not have unrealistic expectations,&quot; Wells said. &quot;These are very, very difficult issues on the table.&quot;</p>
<p>Carey said Wednesday that if UPS was unwilling to negotiate big changes to its offer, there could be no contract. &quot;We have seen no sign that the company has changed its attitude, so we are not particularly optimistic about these new talks,&quot; Carey said.</p>
<p>The resumption of talks was welcomed by businesses, which face headaches moving packages and higher shipping costs from overloaded UPS rivals.</p>
<p>America's blood centres, which collect about half of the nation's blood supply, said they were experiencing delivery problems of blood and blood components, affecting critically ill patients.</p>
<p>More than 60 units of red blood cells and 30 units of random donor platelets were destroyed because so-called overnight delivery was delayed.</p>
<p>A prolonged strike could also damage the economy, Federal Reserve Governor Susan Phillips said Thursday. &quot;If it goes on for a long time, we'll start to see some economic impact,&quot; Phillips told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, she added: &quot;I'm not too worried at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, UPS filed court motions in several states seeking to prevent striking workers from interfering with company operations. &quot;Quite frankly in a number of different areas, they have been impeding our ability to do business,&quot; spokeswoman Jennifer Jiles said.</p>
<p>The motions were filed in federal courts in Massachusetts, California and other states, she said.</p>
<p>The strike began at a minute past midnight EDT Monday (0401 GMT) after a last-ditch 17-hour marathon negotiation collapsed.</p>
<p>The Teamsters blamed the strike on the company's refusal to create thousands of full-time jobs each year from part-time positions and to stop handing union work to outside suppliers.</p>
<p>Between 120,000 and 130,000 union-represented workers are part-time. The union represents about two-thirds of the 300,000 workers at Atlanta-based UPS.</p>
<p>UPS said the real issue was the Teamsters' refusal to let the company withdraw from a pension plan that includes 30 other companies, mostly trucking firms. UPS says running its own plan would save money in the long run. The union says one plan would be too risky should that employer fail.</p>
<p>Since the strike began, UPS has been handling less than 10 percent of its normal shipments, using 50,000 non-union employees to do the work of striking loaders, sorters and drivers. The company said more than 97 percent of the Teamsters were on strike.</p>
