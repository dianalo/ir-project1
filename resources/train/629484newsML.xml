<p>Police defused a bomb in a polling station in the Mediterranean city of Marseille on Sunday as France held the second round of parliamentary elections, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a detonator, it seemed ready to go off,&quot; a police spokesman said. The device comprised six sticks of dynamite and was placed in a school used as a polling station for the day. Corsican separatists have planted several bombs in southern France.  </p>
<p>About 35 people were evacuated from the building after the bomb, weiging about two kilos (4.4 lb) was found at about 2.20 p.m. (1220 GMT). Police explosives experts defused the device.</p>
<p>Police said the bomb may have been planted on Saturday night. &quot;We don't know if it was the school or the polling booth that was targeted,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Police made no arrests but were investigating suspicions that Corsican guerrillas, battling for more than two decades for greater independence from France, may have been responsible.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the hardline FLNC Corsican guerrilla group claimed responsibility for a bomb attack overnight on a post office in Marseille. The bomb caused damage but no casualties.</p>
