<p>Iran's deputy foreign minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi has arrived in Ankara amid growing tension between the two neighbours in the wake of Turkey's month-long incursion into northern Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;He brought a message from (Iranian President Hashemi) Rafsanjani to President Suleyman Demirel,&quot; a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know what the message says at the moment. He is expected to meet Demirel later (on Tuesday),&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Boroujerdi arrived late on Monday and was to meet Demirel at 8 pm (1700 GMT), officials said.</p>
<p>The Turkish military has accused Iran, among other countries, of supplying separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party with sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles used to shoot down two Turkish army helicopters.</p>
<p>Iran has publically denied the accusations.</p>
<p>Turkish media reported that Iran has demanded Turkey's forces not enter the Hakurk region of northern Iraq, near the point where the three neighbouring countries meet. The troops, backed by air power, entered Iraq on May 14.</p>
<p>Turkey's Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan locked in a feud with the military over Islamic activism and his desire for closer ties with Iran, also warned the army about the region, the media said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got very close to the Iranian border. It is a very sensitive area. We must be very careful,&quot; the daily Sabah quoted Erbakan as telling the army's chief of staff on Monday.</p>
<p>The Iraqi National Congress, citing satellite telephone links with the area, said about 2,000 guerrillas of the PKK, backed by other local forces, had clashed with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) close to the Iranian border.</p>
<p>The PKK, were joined by the Kurdish Hizbollah, the Kurdistan Conservative Party and the Kurdistan Social Democratic Party -- all believed to have close ties to Iran, the INC spokesman said.</p>
<p>Between 700 to 1,000 PKK guerrillas had earlier crossed into Hakurk from neighbouring Iran armed with Soviet-designed Grad multiple missile launchers, he said.</p>
<p>The region, however, remains closed to all journalists, making any independent confirmation impossible.</p>
