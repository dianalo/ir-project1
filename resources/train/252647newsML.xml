<p>Anti-graft hero Antonio Di Pietro, whose probes brought a wave of arrests, is getting a taste of his own medicine -- depicted as a jailbird by the makers of Italian Christmas crib figurines.</p>
<p>Naples artisan Guiseppe Ferrigno who crafts traditional and novelty clay figures for nativity cribs popular in Italy, on Thursday unveiled his latest creation showing a downcast Di Pietro banging on the metal bars of a prison cell.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not political but I've been reading the papers and seeing things as they are,&quot; said Ferrigno, 61.</p>
<p>Di Pietro, who was the star of the 'Clean Hands' pool of magistrates whose corruption probes toppled the ruling political class until he quit two years ago, was himself placed under investigation last month for alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>He has not been charged or arrested.</p>
<p>The enquiry prompted Di Pietro, still one of the most popular public figures in Italy, to resign as public works minister and Italians are gripped by the case.</p>
<p>However, Di Pietro still has strong support in Naples.</p>
<p>Artisan Angelo Lofredo, who creates a range of characters from the &quot;Clean Hands&quot; investigations, said his figurine depicting Di Pietro as a hero in his formal magistrates robes was still the top seller of the range.</p>
