<p>Peru wants to take advantage of India's technological expertise and in return can offer its own vast mineral resources, visiting President Alberto Fujimori said on Monday.</p>
<p>Fujimori, who arrived in New Delhi late on Sunday on a four-day official visit, told reporters he would hold talks with Indian leaders on common security issues linked to insurgency.</p>
<p>Peruvian troops killed 14 leftist guerrillas to end a 127-day hostage crisis in Lima last month.</p>
<p>Fujimori spoke at the presidential palace after being received by President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the most important aspect is trade ties,&quot; said Fujimori, who was set to address business leaders in New Delhi on Tuesday. &quot;India has technology and at the same time, Peru has mineral resources that may be useful to India.&quot;</p>
<p>The visit, the first by the Peruvian leader to South Asia, was expected to raise the profile of the Latin American nation in India, which began opening its markets in 1990.</p>
<p>Peru and India signed six agreements, including one on promoting joint ventures and travel between the two countries to boost tourism and another on joint efforts to strengthen knowledge and expertise on Antarctica.</p>
<p>The other agreements were on consultations between the foreign offices, cooperation on diplomatic expertise, technical cooperation through deputation of experts and agricultural research.</p>
<p>After the agreements were signed, Gujral said he hoped to visit Peru in the near future after an invitation from Fujimori. The two leaders said they had discussed &quot;South-South&quot; cooperation between developing countries during their talks.</p>
<p>Earlier, asked whether he would hold talks on armed militancy, Fujimori said: &quot;Certainly there will be some comments with the president and prime minister. I think the world has to keep peace in order to achieve development.&quot;</p>
<p>India is grappling with armed separatist movements in Kashmir, its northeast and pockets of the east and south.</p>
<p>Peruvian troops killed 14 rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement on April 22 while releasing 72 hostages who were being held in the Japanese ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>&quot;I have conveyed my deep appreciation (to Fujimori) in dealing with the siege and hostage crisis in Lima,&quot; Gujral said.</p>
<p>Last week, Peruvian security forces captured two military leaders of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group, which is feared to be starting a new campaign of violence.</p>
<p>The Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement last week that the two nations faced similar human rights challenges.</p>
<p>&quot;In many ways, the challenges and crises encountered by Peru in the last few years, including terrorism and pressure from developed countries on issues concerning human rights, are also echoed in our experiences of the past few years,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>In 1996, India exported goods worth $41 million to Peru, mainly motorcycles, bicycles, tyres and tubes, three-wheel vehicles, pharmaceuticals and automobile and bicycle parts.</p>
<p>India's imports, mainly fishmeal, zinc and pima cotton, totalled $15 million.</p>
