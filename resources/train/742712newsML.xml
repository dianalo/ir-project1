<p>Bougainvillean rebels plan to release five Papua New Guinea soldiers held hostage since September 1996 as a sign of goodwill, according to a statement released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;After exhaustive consultation amongst our leaders and my delegation, we are now, as our goodwill to the people of Papua New Guinea, agreed to release the five POWs held in South Bougainville,&quot; the statement, dated July 18 but released by New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon's office on Tuesday, said.</p>
<p>The statement was signed by Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) Commander General Sam Kauona, BRA chief of operations Ishmael Toroama and Southern Commander Peter Naguou.</p>
<p>It said the hostages would be handed over to New Zealand government representatives on board the frigate Canterbury on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The place of the handover would be settled by negotiation between New Zealand and the BRA.</p>
<p>McKinnon welcomed the announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision reflects the unity which has emerged at Burnham and underpins a widespread desire for peace between all parties to the conflict. It is a very promising development,&quot; McKinnon said.</p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Saturday called on the rebels to release the five, and welcomed the signing of a peace declaration by BRA and PNG-backed Bougainville officials on Friday after two weeks of talks at the Burnham military camp near Christchurch.</p>
<p>Officials from the BRA and its political wing and the Bougainville Transitional Government (BTG) signed a declaration pledging to negotiate with the government, which was not a party to the talks, starting in September.</p>
<p>They also agreed to work towards a ceasefire, the demilitarisation of Bougainville and for an international peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>Thousands have died in the Bougainville conflict since landowners revolted in 1988 over damage caused by the huge Panguna copper mine, and the royalties they received from it.</p>
<p>The mine is owned by a unit of the Anglo-Australian giant Rio Tinto Ltd.</p>
<p>Pacific affairs commentator David Robie told Radio New Zealand from Port Moresby the release of the hostages could act as a kind of circuit-breaker.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government tomorrow could certainly take this to good advantage to move steadily and strongly towards peace,&quot; he said.  </p>
