<p>South Africa's SA Bias Industries Ltd said on Thursday that it plans to delist its shares from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) following tough conditions in the clothing and footwear sector and a consistently poor performance in its share price.</p>
<p>The clothing firm said that the delisting will take place on September 25 if approved by shareholders and the other necessary legal authorities.</p>
<p>It said that although SA Bias was on a sounder footing now, after substantial losses in the previous financial year due, it seemed unlikely that its share price would reach a point where the firm would be able to make use of the market to raise funds, diversify or expand.</p>
<p>SA Bias said it expected interim earnings in the year to June 30 to be approximately 16.0 cents a share and the dividend five cents each. The results are due to be published on July 31. Another factor supporting a delisting was the tightly-held nature of SA Bias which is 90 percent held by Sabvest Ltd . Trading in the share was therefore limited.</p>
<p>SA Bias said that it proposed that the Sabhold Group Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sabvest through which it holds the SA Bias shares, should obtain total ownership of SA Bias through a payment to minority shareholders of 270 cents a share.</p>
<p>SA Bias shares finished at 250 cents on the JSE on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In addition shareholders would be entitled to receive the five cents interim dividend.</p>
<p>The firm said the difficult trading environment had arisen due to price and quality pressure from the high level of imports, both legal and illegal, into the domestic market. As ar result most of the clothing manufacturing shares listed on the JSE had traded at a considerable discount to their net asset values. </p>
