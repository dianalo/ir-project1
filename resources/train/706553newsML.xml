<title>SOUTH KOREA: Bank of Korea to liberalise savings rates.</title>
<headline>Bank of Korea to liberalise savings rates.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-07-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The central Bank of Korea (BOK) said on Thursday it would allow banks to set their own interest rates on savings accounts from July 7.</p>
<p>Under current regulations, South Korean banks have set their annual interest rate on savings accounts at three percent.  </p>
<p>A BOK statement said interest rates on savings accounts for individuals would be also liberalised, even if account holders withdrew their money less than three months after deposit. The rates are currently set at three percent.</p>
<p>The central bank earlier had freed rates on deposits of more than three months.</p>
<p>The liberalisation is part of a cautious South Korean programme that was launched in 1991.</p>
<p>But decontrol on all demand deposits would not be considered until after 1998, as savings are a major source of money for banks.  </p>
<p>The central bank said it would allow banks to introduce money market deposit accounts from next Monday.</p>
<p>The market-sensitive account would offer interest rates comparable to money market rates. Depositors would be able to withdraw their money on demand and interest rates would normally be higher, a BOK statement said.</p>
<p>The statement said the central bank expected the new product to improve competitiveness among banks and non-banking financial institutions.</p>
<p>To raise the funding capability of banks, the central bank said it also would allow banks to issue three-year bonds.  </p>
<p>The bond issue amount would be limited to no more than 50 percent of the bank's equity capital. But in the first year, issues would be limited to no more than 25 percent of their equity capital.</p>
<p>The central bank forecast bonds issued by banks would total 4.8 trillion won over the next year, compared to South Korea's total estimated bond issues of 36 trillion won.</p>
<p>The estimated first-year bond issuances would account for 1.8 percent of total money raised by banks at the end of April, 1997. Banks would not be allowed to sell bonds before their maturity date.  </p>
<p>Such bond issues are currently allowed only for specialised banks such as the Korea Development Bank, Housing and Commercial Bank, Long-term Credit Bank and Industrial Bank of Korea.</p>
<p>Some state restrictions on banks' asset management would also be relaxed this month.</p>
<p>Loan obligations to small- and medium-sized companies by regional banks would be reduced to 60 percent of their total lendings from the current 70 percent. The Industrial Bank of Korea's obligation would be cut to 80 percent from 90 percent.</p>
<p>But the loan obligation for city banks would remain unchanged at 45 percent.  </p>
<p>The central bank also lifted restrictions which barred banks from extending loans for condominium construction. The statement said condominiums had become popular lesuire facilities.</p>
<p>The statement said the liberalisation of savings rates by banks would be expanded to 81.6 percent from the current 60.5 percent with the moves.</p>
<p>A central bank official said interest rates on passbook, checking and household accounts would be freed at some time after January 1, 1998.</p>
