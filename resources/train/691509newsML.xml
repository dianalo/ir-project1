<p>Key IMM currency futures ended moderately lower after a session of steady losses.</p>
<p>September yen futures erased all of Tuesday's gains and broke through several support levels and September marks ended not far from contract lows.</p>
<p>The dollar, stocks and bonds were strong all session.</p>
<p>&quot;It was steady pressure all day and they closed the dollar toward its highs,&quot; an IMM currency analyst said. &quot;We've got a big week next week and alot of volatility ahead of us.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said all eyes were now on next week's heavy U.S. economic calendar.  </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee meets July 1 and 2, national purchasing management and June jobs data will be released, and trade will shut early Thursday and be closed Friday for U.S Independence Day.</p>
<p>Traders said action was only light to moderate Friday.</p>
<p>Currency weakness began overnight and continued all session, further hampered by U.S. data this morning.</p>
<p>The dollar gleaned added strength from the U.S. final first-quarter gross domestic product, revised to up 5.9 percent from the latest preliminary reading of 5.8 percent. A Reuters poll had pegged an average forecast of up 5.9 percent.  </p>
<p>The overnight moves got started when yen took a hit on dampened expectations for a rate rise in Japan. Concerns over a soft common European currency plagued marks and Swiss, traders said.</p>
<p>Day session trade just extended those moves, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It really wasn't a very dramatic day, despite the price action,&quot; an IMM currency trader said. &quot;I trickled lower all day but it wasn't great volume and it wasn't poor volume,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted bank buying late in the day in September marks at $0.5780, stemming losses.  </p>
<p>Marks slid to $0.5780 during the session, not far from the $0.5770 contract low set June 6.</p>
<p>At the close, Sept yen was off $0.000101 to $0.008827, marks were off $0.0044 to $0.5782, Swiss francs fell $0.0084 to $0.6941, sterling fell $0.0018 to $1.6596, Canadian dollars rose $0.0010 to $0.7282 and Mexican pesos were $0.000100 higher at $0.121650. ((Derivatives desk 312-408-8750))</p>
