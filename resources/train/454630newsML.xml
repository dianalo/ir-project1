<headline>Asian crude firmer, Oman differentials talked down.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian crude prices were firmer on Wednesday but Oman differentials were being talked lower, in what some said was a tactic to spook the market.</p>
<p>Overnight Brent and NYMEX futures surged as prices broke out of their previous range. A barge accident on the Mississippi river in the U.S., which has closed down the river to barge traffic, added to the bullish tone.</p>
<p>But physical trading in Asia remained subdued.</p>
<p>Oman was heard twice traded at MPM -2/3 cents.</p>
<p>However, traders were sceptical of the trades because one of the sellers denied his deal.  </p>
<p>And traders said the other deal could have been talked to spook the market and get prices lower.</p>
<p>Traders assessed Oman around flat to MPM.</p>
<p>Other Middle East grades were quiet.</p>
<p>Minas crude for April was offered by producers at flat to ICP, but few bidders were on show amid expectations of an overhang of the crude in April.</p>
<p>Tapis remained on offer from a producer at quotes plus $1.00 and a major was offering a late April Cossack crude, aiming to achieve a premium in the 20s.</p>
