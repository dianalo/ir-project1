<p>Devon Malcolm grabbed three wickets for 14 runs in 20 balls as England checked Australia's progress in the fifth Ashes test on Friday.</p>
<p>England captured five wickets for 103 on the second morning at Trent Bridge, but Australia were still in a strong position when they went to lunch at 405 for eight.</p>
<p>There was more bounce and swing on a humid day, with a number of deliveries lifting sharply, which enabled Andy Caddick and Dean Headley, then fellow paceman Malcolm, to peg back Australia after they resumed at 302 for three.</p>
<p>Mark Waugh was first to go, having added only eight to his overnight 60. He was trapped leg before by Caddick, ending a partnership of 86 with his twin brother Steve.</p>
<p>Three overs later Ricky Ponting played on to Headley for nine.</p>
<p>Malcolm came on as first change and further upset Australia's hopes of a huge total by dispatching Ian Healy, Shane Warne and Steve Waugh.</p>
<p>Healy, who had been struck painfully on the forearm by Headley, edged Malcolm to slip, having made 16, and Warne went in a similar way without scoring.</p>
<p>Steve Waugh proved harder to shift, driving and cutting beautifully, but on 75 his forward defensive stroke was beaten by a superb delivery from Malcolm which left the batsman just enough to uproot the off stump.</p>
<p>Paul Reiffel (19 not out) and Jason Gillespie (9 not out) were together at lunch.</p>
<p>Australia lead 2-1 in the six-test series and need only draw here to retain the Ashes, of which they are holders.</p>
