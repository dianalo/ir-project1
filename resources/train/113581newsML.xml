<p>Spot wholesale electricity prices in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region rose Monday amid reports of reduced output from the Limerick nuclear unit 1, market sources said.</p>
<p>Output at the 1,163 megawatt (MW) nuclear power plant in Pottstown, Pa., was heard reduced by 400-450 MW as technicians were repairing a condenser pump, industry sources said.</p>
<p>They added Limerick 1 was expected to begin toward full power later today, following completion of repairs.</p>
<p>PECO Energy Co, the operator of Limerick, declined to comment on the repair at Limerick 1.</p>
<p>A number of participants downplayed the significance of the reduced production from Limerick 1 because of moderate weather all along the eastern seaboard, especially for Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's dull, flat load day,&quot; a regional trader said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic are expected to peak in the 60's Fahrenheit range.</p>
<p>Peach Bottom 2 nuclear unit in Delta, Pa., also operated by PECO, resumed 100 percent output after being taken off line last Wednesday due to a problem with the oil line to the generator, PECO confirmed.</p>
<p>The return of Peach Bottom 2 would offset the brief power reduction at Limerick 1, market sources said.</p>
<p>In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool, firm, peak electricity prices for Tuesday delivery climbed to the $22.50-$23.25 a megawatt hour (MWh), up from Friday's $21.25-$22.00 range for Monday.</p>
<p>Firm, peak PJM power for the rest of the week was quoted at $22.50-$23.50, up sharply from a quote of $20.00-$21.00 on Friday.</p>
<p>PJM electricity for the balance of October was discussed at $22.00-$23.00, wider than Friday's range of $22.50-$23.00.</p>
<p>November PJM prices were assessed at $22.65-$22.75, better bid than Friday's $22.50-$22.75 range.</p>
<p>December PJM power was pegged at $26.75-$27.00, compared with a quote near $26.75.</p>
<p>For the balance of the fourth quarter, PJM electricity was talked at $23.75-$24.00.</p>
<p>First-quarter 1997 PJM was quoted at $28.15-$28.50 while January/February 1997 PJM electricity was assessed at $30.50-$30.65, up slightly from Friday's $30.45-$30.75.</p>
<p>Second-quarter 1997 PJM deliveries were discussed at $21.75-$22.25.</p>
