<p>India's leading industrialised states on Tuesday vied with each other to lure private investment.</p>
<p>Politicians from the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra -- India's most industrialised states -- and from Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's Karnataka state in south India invited investors at a conference in Bombay to do business in their regions.</p>
<p>Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi announced &quot;Advantage Maharashtra&quot;, a conference to be organised by the state next month, where more than 50 projects totalling around $5.0 billion would be offered to private investors.</p>
<p>&quot;I have requested those who want to invest to come with cheques in their hands...I will take the cheques and give them the projects,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>R.V. Deshpande, Industry Minister of Karnataka, whose capital Bangalore is described as India's Silicon valley, listed the advantages of his state, which he said included skilled manpower and a low rate of labour disputes.</p>
<p>Deshpande said his state had the country's largest deposits of gold and provided a major portion of India's coffee and silk output.</p>
<p>Karnataka was likely to become the centre for private investment in steel and cement by 2000, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be producing more than 18 million tonnes of steel by the year 2000,&quot; Deshpande said.</p>
<p>Gujarat's Chief Minister Shanker Sinh Vaghela pointed out that his state was &quot;number one in industrial investment.&quot;</p>
<p>He told investors recent political differences had not affected the state's bureaucratic network, which acted swiftly to clear private investment.</p>
