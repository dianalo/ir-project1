<title>FRANCE: French stocks start lower on profit-taking.</title>
<headline>French stocks start lower on profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Profit-taking took French shares lower at the opening on Friday, after the market's sharp gains of the last few days and yesterday's 1.23 percent rise, traders said. A softer Wall Street also contributed to the easing.</p>
<p>But the market was well supported, with non-resident investors still finding Paris attractive. &quot;They are forced to come in, the market is going up,&quot; said one trader. Company earnings were considered good, particularly retailer Promodes.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was down 14.85 points or 0.55 percent at 2,684.07 at 0927 GMT while the CAC-40 futures contract was down 12 at 2,692 from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was one billion francs</p>
<p>The retailing sector featured, with Promodes bucking the market, rising 5.73 percent to 1,882 francs. Casino also outperformed, advancing 0.14 percent to 276.4 francs.</p>
<p>Promodes pleased with net attributable profit up 22 percent and a raised dividend, while Casino was seen as catching up on operating margins and benefiting from restructuring.</p>
<p>BNP starred among bank stocks, rising 0.84 percent to 274.5 francs after doubling net attributable profit. Societe Generale was steady.</p>
<p>Broadcaster Canal Plus gains 1.42 percent to 1,069 after British Sky Broadcasting Plc (BSkyB) and the private Kirch group dropped plans to launch the DF1 German digital television service which would have split the German market. Canal Plus is teamed up with Bertelsmann for the Premiere service.</p>
<p>Pechiney falls 2.56 percent to 263.1 francs. The aluminium group reported a net loss of 2.98 billion, higher than some forecasts. Oddo had pencilled in a loss of 2.45 billion.</p>
<p>Food group Bongrain gains 2.6 percent to 2,208 after posting net profit down 15.8 percent but holding the dividend. Some analysts view the stock as undervalued.</p>
