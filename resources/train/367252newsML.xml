<title>FRANCE: French stocks end touch lower in solid volume.</title>
<headline>French stocks end touch lower in solid volume.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>French shares closed on Monday with narrow losses, after trading most of the day in positive territory.</p>
<p>Traders said a slightly softer Wall Street took the shine off Paris stocks but the market was generally well supported, with fresh money pouring in as investors who missed January's bull run attempt to catch up.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 2.15 points or 0.08 percent at 2,595.37, while the CAC-40 futures contract was up at 2,603 from 2,601 on Friday's close.</p>
<p>Volume was a hefty 8.2 billion francs.</p>
<p>Retailer Pinault-Printemps-Redoute strengthens 3.25 percent to 2,445 francs. The stock is seen as one of those which missed the market's rise in January and is benefiting from a catch-up by investors who held back from buying in expectation of a major consolidation, which has yet to come.</p>
<p>Brokers point to a possible trigger for the rise in Pinault shares following news the CDR holding company is selling its 25 percent stake in Artemis, which is 75-percent owned by Francois Pinault and which holds the interest in Pinault-Printemps.</p>
<p>Alcatel Alsthom, Eiffage, Bouygues and Promodes are among other laggards staging big gains.</p>
<p>Alcatel gains 3.04 percent to 576 francs, Promodes up 4.16 percent to 1,627, Bouygues up 3.2 percent to 580 and Eiffage rises 5.64 percent to 337.</p>
<p>Financials put in solid gains, led by CCF, which adds 7.09 percent to 275 francs, Societe Generale, which was helped by a Goldman Sachs upgrade to market outperformer, put on 2.48 percent to 662, while Axa gains 1.45 percent to 378.7.</p>
<p>Brokers said Axa's U.S. Equitable unit is expected to post strong earnings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Michelin extends gains, rises 3.33 percent to 354.</p>
