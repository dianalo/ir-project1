<p>Kuwait stepped up a diplomatic offensive on Tuesday to win support from 1991 Gulf War Arab allies following opposition from some countries to U.S. military strikes against Iraq.</p>
<p>Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Saud al-Sabah left around dawn for Egypt to discuss steps taken so far in Washington's latest standoff with Iraq and would go on from Cairo to Syria, officials said.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Sheikh Ahmad Hamoud al-Jaber al-Sabah left late on Monday for talks with some of the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), some of whom apparently have reservations about a U.S. military buildup in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;We know who our enemy is -- and we know who our friends are. The future of this country is above any other consideration,&quot; columnist Bader al-Asfar wrote in al-Watan about Kuwait's repeated post-Gulf War security flare-ups with Iraq.</p>
<p>Egypt and Syria are the Arab world's two main military powers which formed the Damascus Declaration alliance with the GCC days after a U.S.-led coalition ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait in 1991.</p>
<p>The oil-rich, Saudi-dominated GCC also groups Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah flew to Britain on Monday night from France following talks in Egypt with President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti campaign follows hard on the heels of a lightning bout of U.S. lobbying of its Western partners to preserve the old coalition against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Opposition by most Arab allies, France and Turkey to direct involvement in possible U.S. military strikes against Iraq is making it difficult for Washington and Kuwait to justify additional action without further splits in the alliance.</p>
<p>Kuwait on Monday agreed to receive more U.S. soldiers and stressed it would not hesitate to take further measures to deter what it sees as threats by former occupier Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;The (U.S.) ground troops, which are on their way to Kuwait, will be in Kuwait soon, or sooner than later,&quot; Sheikh Saud said on Monday.</p>
<p>But a spokesman at a U.S. military storage facility in Kuwait said on Tuesday the troop deployment to Kuwait remained on standby and no order to travel had been given.</p>
<p>U.S. Army Sergeant James Yocum, a spokesman at Camp Doha military facility north of Kuwait City, told Reuters Television that as of the last information he had received the soldiers were still on standby and &quot;have had no movement order&quot;.</p>
<p>Kuwait has defended its decision to allow additional U.S. troops and eight Stealth fighter-bombers to be based in Kuwait as part of Washington's military buildup in the Gulf for possible wider strikes against Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry was in London on Monday to brief French and British counterparts on the Iraq crisis at the end of his Gulf tour. He also visited NATO ally Turkey to secure support for a possible showdown with Iraq.</p>
<p>Britain strongly backed President Bill Clinton's action.</p>
<p>But France has distanced itself from U.S. cruise missile strikes on Iraq two weeks ago in retaliation for Saddam's sending of troops into northern Kurdish areas to back a faction which has since gained control over the area.</p>
<p>Many U.S. Arab allies and Turkey, Iraq's northern neighbour, gave Perry few concrete signs of support in his search for a tightening of military and economic pressure against Baghdad.</p>
