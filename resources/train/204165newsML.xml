<p>A federal court Tuesday paved the way for the proposed multibillion-dollar merger of Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp to proceed, by denying rival railroad company Norfolk Southern Corp.'s request to block the deal.</p>
<p>After a two-day hearing, U.S. District Judge Donald Van Artsdalen forcefully rejected arguments by Norfolk Southern, which has made a $10 billion cash bid for Conrail, that Conrail's board violated its duties under Pennsylvania law and misled shareholders in agreeing to merge with CSX.</p>
<p>CSX initially offered $8.1 billion in cash and stock for Philadelpia-based Conrail, then raised the bid to $8.5 billion earlier this month.</p>
<p>The decision allows CSX to proceed with the first step of the merger, a $110-per-share tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail shares. The Richmond, Va., railroad's tender offer closes at midnight Wednesday.</p>
<p>Norfolk, Va.-based Norfolk Southern immediately appealed the decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking it to block the deal pending resolution of the appeal.</p>
<p>Conrail and CSX said in a joint statement, &quot;We are gratified with the court's decision, which enables us to proceed as planned with the CSX tender offer -- the first step of a CSX-Conrail merger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are fully committed to completing out strategic merger and we believe it clearly is the superior business combination,&quot; the companies said.</p>
<p>The case is seen as a major test of Pennsylvania's corporate law, which allows company boards to consider a wide variety of &quot;constituents,&quot; including a company's employees, suppliers, customers and surrounding communities when evaluating takeover offers.</p>
<p>The law was passed in the wake of 1980s takeover battles that scarred several Pennsylvania firms, and it runs counter to law in Delaware, the legal home of most major U.S. corporations,  which holds shareholder interests must be paramount when evaluating competing bids for a company.</p>
<p>In a lengthy recitation of his decision, Van Artsdalen said, &quot;This duty (of the directors) is to the corporation, not necessarily to the shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Basically, the law of Pennsylvania leaves decisions such as what is best for the corporation to be taken by the duly elected board of directors, rather than be subject to second-guessing by the courts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said there was no evidence presented that Conrail directors violated their duties to the company.</p>
<p>Van Artsdalen also rejected arguments by Norfolk Southern that the Conrail-CSX deal effectively coerced Conrail shareholders into accepting it by offering high cash terms to buy enough shares to win a shareholder vote for the merger and by offering a lower value in CSX shares for the remainder.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see any coercion, but only several options,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ruling, if upheld by the appeals court, would make the decisive forum for the merger a December meeting at which Conrail shareholders will be asked to waive, for CSX, a state law that effectively requires a company to pay cash for all shares once it has acquired a 20 percent stake.</p>
<p>CSX has said it would pay cash for 40 percent of the Conrail shares and swap CSX shares for the rest.</p>
<p>Testifying at the hearing Tuesday, Conrail Chairman David LeVan said the firm was still trying to wring an improved offer from CSX. &quot;We're in discussions about some enhancement of value or some protection of value for the transaction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Conrail board member E. Bradley Jones testified that Conrail saw the impending shareholder vote as an opportunity to obtain an improved bid. &quot;The greatest hope that we have is that there will be a recognition by CSX that they have a great chance of losing the ... vote,&quot; at current prices, he said.</p>
