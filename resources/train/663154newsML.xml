<p>Komercni Banka, the most heavily weighted banking issue on the bourse, led the PX50 index into the doldrums in exceptionally quiet trading on Monday.</p>
<p>The PX50 was unchanged on 506.0.</p>
<p>Komercni fell 21 crowns to 2,009 but despite being the second most actively traded share during continuous trading chalked up just 1.2 million crowns in turnover.</p>
<p>Dealers said Komercni was mainly the victim of worries about the Czech economy although they conceded that the bank's position as the biggest commercial bank made it relatively more exposed to the downturn in the business cycle than other banks.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the major focus is on the economy than on the bank itself,&quot; said Lubomir Vystavel of ING Barings.</p>
<p>Vystavel added that the absence of SPT Telecom and CEZ, by far the two most heaviliy capitalised Cech shares, had probably had a knock-on effect in terms of interest for Komercni and the market as a whole.</p>
<p>The ownership deadline for dividend payouts to Komercni shareholders is June 25. Komercni will pay a 101 crown gross dividend.</p>
<p>Overall, turnover plunged to 408 million crowns.</p>
