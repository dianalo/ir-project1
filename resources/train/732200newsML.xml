<title>THAILAND: Mandela urges Thais to increase investment.</title>

<p>South African President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday urged Thai leaders to invest more in his country, Thai officials said.</p>
<p>Mandela, who arrived on Wednesday for a two-day visit to strengthen relations and improve trade with Thailand, made the comments during talks with Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and other officials.</p>
<p>The South African leader told the Thai officials there were plenty of opportunities in his country and said basic infrastructure had improved over the past few years, government spokesman Varathep Ratanakorn told reporters.</p>
<p>Varathep told Reuters earlier Chavalit also planned to discuss ways to boost tourism and improve trade between the two countries.</p>
<p>Last year two-way trade totalled about 10.4 billion baht ($347 million) and Thailand had a slight trade deficit with South Africa, Varathep said.</p>
<p>Mandela, whose visit to Thailand is the last stop on a three-nation tour, appeared tired and moved gingerly as he inspected the guard with Chavalit before their meeting.</p>
<p>Wearing a suit and tie instead of his trademark patterned shirts, the 78-year old leader was assisted several times by Chavalit during the welcome ceremony at Government House.</p>
<p>Mandela, who will receive an honorary doctorate from Chulalongkorn University on Thursday, arrived in Thailand after visits to Indonesia and Britain.</p>
