<p>Takashimaya Co Ltd said on Monday that 2.9 million people had visited its new Tokyo branch in the 17 days since its opening on October 4 and that sales at the store for that period totalled 7.9 billion yen.</p>
<p>The company said earlier it had forecast sales at the store in Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's busiest shopping districts in central Tokyo, at 80 billion yen in the initial year of operation.  </p>
<p>Takashimaya's Shinjuku store is in a huge 11-floor shopping mall which also houses large book and music stores, an indoor amusement park, beauty parlours, a 3-D theatre and other facilities. Takashimaya invested 160 billion yen in the 55,000 square metre mall.</p>
<p>&quot;I think shoppers' initial enthusiam towards the new store will last longer than originally thought,&quot; Takashimaya president Tatsuro Tanaka told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said a nationwide food poisoning epidemic earlier this year and a racketeering incident involving some Takashimaya officials had had almost no impact on its sales in the six months to August 31.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, some Takashimaya officials were arrested on suspicion of violating Japan's commercial code by paying money to racketeers to ensure the company's 1995 shareholders' meeting went smoothly.</p>
<p>Sales of food at many retailers in Japan were hit this summer by a widespread food poisoning epidemic, caused by the O-157 strain of the E. coli bacteria.</p>
<p>Takashimaya announced on Monday that its parent sales for the half year to August 31 were 511.53 billion yen against 346.23 billion yen in the same period last year.</p>
