<headline>Canada bonds end stronger in thin, illiquid market.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1996-12-20</dateline>

<p>Canadian bonds closed stronger on Friday, with spreads to U.S. long bonds narrowing sharply, but with gains seen as negligible in light of very low trading volumes, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are closing positive with a pretty firm tone, but once again the caveat how low volume is. It's easy to push around prices,&quot; said Jeoff Hall, a Canadian market analyst with financial analysis firm Technical Data.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.95 to C$111.40 to yield 7.043 percent. The U.S. 30-year bond fell 3/32 to yield 6.59 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the benchmark bonds narrowed to 45 basis points from 52 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if I'd really say it's positive. It's more just illiquid. No one is trading it, so the people who want to push it can push it,&quot; said one T-bill trader.</p>
<p>Dealers said most desks were thinly staffed with the holiday season and an industry luncheon in Toronto keeping many traders away.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds made sharp gains despite stronger than expected Canadian economic data.  </p>
<p>Canada's wholesale trade rose a higher-than-expected 1.7 percent seasonally adjusted in October, Statistics Canada said this morning.</p>
<p>The government agency also said the preliminary estimate of average weekly earnings for Canadian workers in all industries except agriculture and fishing rose a higher than  3.0 percent in October from a year earlier.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada 7.0 percent bond due 2006 rose C$0.43 to C$104.25 to 6.414 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond fell 3/32 to yield 6.34 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the bonds narrowed to 7 basis points from 14 basis points at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month cash bill traded at 2.88 percent against the U.S. bill at 5.02 percent.</p>
