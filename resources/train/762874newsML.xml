<p>King Hussein discussed on Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak efforts to overcome obstacles to progress in the stalled Middle East peace talks, officials said.</p>
<p>They said King Hussein, who met Mubarak during a stop at Amman airport from Damascus where he had talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, also discussed coordinating their positions on latest efforts to push ahead stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting continues what we have become accustomed to from time to time. It was an opportunity to discuss matters relating to the peace process, the region and bilateral ties,&quot; the monarch told reporters after Mubarak's departure.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to demand ensuring a just, permanent and honourable solution to the central cause in this part of the world and naturally we support our Palestinian brothers to the utmost of our capabilities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>King Hussein also praised active Egyptian diplomacy in the region to help jump start Israeli-PLO peace talks in crisis since March when Israel broke ground on a 6,500-home Jewish settlement on an Arab East Jerusalem hill.</p>
<p>The monarch said Jordan's role was a supportive one.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been working closely together, Egypt has played a very major role which only Egypt can play and our position has been a complementary one to Egypt in all that has happened so far,&quot; the monarch said.</p>
<p>King Hussein also briefed Mubarak on talks held earlier in Amman with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy which encouraged some optimism about renewed progress, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt he (Levy) gave us the impression that he was concerned with the peace process...and that he had a programme that created optimism about its possible implementation soon to help resolve outstanding issues and then continue peace talks with the Palestinians,&quot; the king said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's diplomatic activity comes a day after Israel put the brakes on a plan to build a new Jewish enclave in Arab East Jerusalem and agreed to resume talks with the PLO on meeting commitments made under their interim peace deals.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Fayez al-Tarawnah said after talks with Levy that Jordan was relieved by Israel's move to defuse tension by halting permits of the new settler plan, saying it was a confidence building step which could relaunch peace talks.</p>
