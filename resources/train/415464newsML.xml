<p>Spending on new construction increased modestly in January, the Commerce Department said on Monday, as builders shook off the impact of bad weather that slowed activity in December.</p>
<p>Spending increased 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $589.8 billion. That followed a revised 0.9 percent decline in December instead of the 0.7 percent drop the department previously reported.</p>
<p>Storms and flooding in December, especially in the West, slowed down many building projects but January weather was less extreme.  </p>
<p>January construction activity was stronger than anticipated by Wall Street economists who had forecast spending would be unchanged from December.</p>
<p>All the gain came in privately financed projects, where spending increased 0.5 percent to a record $445.7 billion after declining 0.3 percent in December.</p>
<p>Spending on new homes and apartments was up 0.4 percent in January to $249.7 billion a year after a slim 0.2 percent december gain. For nonresidential buildings like offices and hotels, January construction spending increased 2.9 percent to $153.8 billion after dropping 3 percent in December.</p>
<p>Government spending on construction projects was flat in January at an annual rate of $144.1 billion. Spending fell on contruction of water supply plants, sewers and new housing projects in January but was up for schools, hospitals and other public buildings.</p>
<p>After allowing for inflation, total construction spending was up 0.5 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted $506.7 billion annual rate after a 1.1 percent drop in December, the department said.</p>
