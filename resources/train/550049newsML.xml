<p>Hungary's top policemen said on Wednesday the recent arrest of 13 people suspected of illegal fuel sales and extortion could also bring an end to a wave of bombings which began last September.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust that we can successfully bring the bombings to an end,&quot; national police chief Laszlo Forgach told a news conference.</p>
<p>Another police official said the bombings were devised to divert police attention from fuel tax and excise duty evasion amounting to billions of forints.</p>
<p>&quot;Huge amounts of kerosene were traded evading taxes and we are in the process of following the thread to the end-users through the numerous links in the chain,&quot; said Colonel Istvan Miko of the National Police.</p>
<p>Police said earlier that almost two dozen explosions of grenades and petrol bombs, mainly in Budapest since September, were linked to an escalating gang turf war.</p>
<p>Forgach said threats against top police officials and of possible attacks on police premises since the April 27 arrests were a measure of police success against the criminals.</p>
