<p>South Korea's state banks will seek to expand overseas borrowings as part of government efforts to support the local currency, the finance ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>As part of steps to encourage the inflow of foreign funds, the ministry was also considering speeding up the expansion of the foreign stock ownership limit, it said.</p>
<p>The government has said that the ceiling on foreign ownership will be raised in 1997 from 20 percent to 23 percent of a listed company.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will consider the expansion at en early date and in addition to the plan,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The ministry, citing a large current account deficit that pressured the local currency, said the government would encourage locally-based firms to seek overseas loans.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to promote expansion of overseas borrowings by banks such as Korea Development Bank and Korea Export and Import Bank,&quot; the statement said. Both banks are run by the state.  </p>
<p>The ministry said foreign manufacturers in South Korea would be allowed to freely borrow abroad if the money was to be used for operating expenses.</p>
<p>The won's value has fallen about six percent against the dollar since the beginning of this year. The won ended Friday at 897.50 to the dollar after touching a record low of 899.30 during the day.</p>
<p>The current account deficit rose to $2.45 billion in February from $1.97 billion a year before, according to Bank of Korea (central bank) figures. The deficit for 1996 was $23.72 billion against $10.06 billion in 1995. The government said it wanted to reduce the deficit to $18 billion this year.</p>
<p>The ministry earlier this month repealed ceilings on local banks' overseas borrowings and lifted the limit on equity-linked bond issues abroad by local companies.</p>
<p>Some foreign exchange dealers forecast the dollar should test the 930 won level in May as dollar demand to pay imports was unlikely to weaken.</p>
