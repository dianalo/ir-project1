<p>German financial leaders on Saturday moved to quell fears that surging unemployment rates threaten Germany's chances of meeting European economic and monetary (EMU) budgetary criteria, saying the jobless problem was grave but not insurmountable.</p>
<p>After a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations, following a week that saw the release of Germany's worst jobless data since the 1930's Depression, Finance Minister Theo Waigel acknowledged the severity of the unemployment issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth alone is not enough to solve labour market problems,&quot; Waigel told reporters, as he forecast 1997 German economic growth between 2.25 to 2.50 percent, which he said was &quot;significantly better than we could have hoped six months ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Waigel also said Germany could still meet the fiscal criteria set down in the Maastricht Treaty, which says budget deficits must not exceed three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, if unemployment fell as expected this year.</p>
<p>Thursday's jobless report showed January unemployment surged by half a million to a post-war record of 4.66 million, prompting widespread concern that German hopes of fulfilling the requirements needed to take part in EMU from January 1999 were under threat.</p>
<p>In 1996, when jobless rates were high but significantly below current levels, Germany badly overshot Maastricht goals for deficits, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3.6 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;More structural efforts will have to be made,&quot; Waigel admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to take the kind of action which our close neighbours, like the Netherlands, have already taken and with much success. This is not only a challenge for politicians, but also for employers and trade unions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Germany is aiming to halve unemployment by the year 2000 and has stuck by that goal in the face of public derision.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl said earlier this week that proposed tax and pension reforms would boost the economy in general while labour reforms to make it more attractive to hire staff would help to create 100,000 to 200,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, also attending the G7 meeting, chimed in to say he did not believe the jobless rate would keep Germany from meeting EMU criteria and said he was confident every effort would be made to make the fiscal grade.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not an easy task, but I hope they (politicians) will succeed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite his overall cautious optimism, Waigel could not be drawn specifically on whether Germany viewed the three-percent budget deficit-to-GDP target as a fixed and unassailable cut-off point, remarking merely &quot;three is three.&quot;</p>
<p>There has been speculation that the ruling in 1998 on which countries can launch the euro could be flexible on that point.</p>
<p>Turning to broader issues, Waigel said German fears that the future single European single currency would be less stable than the much-cherished deutschmark were unjustified.</p>
<p>But he said it was too early to tell which countries would be ready to take part in the first wave of the euro launch and brushed aside queries about Italy's chances of taking part, following the reassuring line taken by Kohl after his meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just the start of February. Every country has a chance to meet the criteria,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the dollar's recent surge against the mark, a main topic of the G7 meeting which Germany chaired, Waigel said he was satisfied with the current level of the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted a stronger dollar, and that is what we have,&quot; the Finance Minister said.</p>
<p>The G7, which includes the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, Canada and Britain, issued a joint statement saying the dollar's plunge in spring 1995 had now been corrected.</p>
<p>That message, Waigel said, should be sufficient to send a clear and positive signal to financial markets.</p>
