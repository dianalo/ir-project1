<p>Louisiana's attorney general has named about 120 insurance companies, including The Hartford and Lloyds of London, as defendants in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry seeking to recover &quot;billions&quot; in Medicaid costs.</p>
<p>&quot;This petition leaves the tobacco companies' insurers little choice,&quot; state Attorney General Richard Ieyoub said in a statement. &quot;They either pay up or they join us.&quot;</p>
<p>Louisiana is the only state to directly sue insurers over tobacco and the costs of treating illnesses stemming from its use. Twenty-two other states have focused on tobacco companies in their litigation trying to recover costs incurred by their Medicaid health care programmes for the poor and disabled. Louisiana is arguing the tobacco companies are covered under their general liability policies, Drew Ranier, counsel to the attorney general, said Thursday.</p>
<p>The petition filed in Louisiana's 14th Judicial District Court last Friday names about 120 insurance companies and involves 750 general liability policies written from 1950 to 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the start of the insurance coverage wars,&quot; said Robert Carter, a policyholder attorney in the Washington office of the McKenna &amp; Cuneo law firm.</p>
<p>&quot;At a minimum, it's a recognition the insurance industry is going to be a major player in the tobacco litigation,&quot; he said. It also &quot;reinforces what the policyholder bar has been saying, and that is that the tobacco liabilities should be and are properly covered under liability insurance policies.&quot;</p>
<p>Ieyoub said he will move ahead to use the legal discovery process to determine what secret insurance industry documents are available.</p>
<p>&quot;This opens a second front against the tobacco companies who have caused hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths and illnesses in our state, and have lured children to become addicted to tobacco,&quot; Ieyoub said in the statement issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the revelations about the tobacco industry excesses have come out in the discovery process, and this will open a new set of doors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ranier said many policies do not exclude tobacco liabilities as insurance companies contend or those exclusions do not apply to the state's case.</p>
<p>&quot;If the insurance companies contend otherwise, we want to see the evidence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Insurers that argue the policies do not cover intentional acts will be forced to prove the tobacco companies knew tobacco was harmful when they were seeking coverage, Ranier said. &quot;If they don't want to provide coverage, they must become our allies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, Denise Bottcher, said the state's tobacco-related Medicaid costs are currently about $300 million a year and the state is seeking recovery of past and future costs.</p>
<p>The state estimates that those total costs to be &quot;in the billions,&quot; Bottcher said.</p>
<p>She said the total amount will depend on the number of years for which the state seeks compensation.</p>
<p>Insurers named in the lawsuit include Aetna Inc., Lloyds of London, American International Group Inc., The Hartford, Liberty Mutual Group, Home Insurance, St. Paul Cos. Inc., ACE Ltd., EXEL Ltd., CIGNA Corp. and Continental Corp., which was bought by CNA Financial Corp.</p>
<p>CNA Financial said it was reviewing the documents and had no immediate comment on the petition, and  American International Group declined to comment. Other insurers were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Philip Morris Cos. Inc. blasted the petition as &quot;nothing more than an attempt to divert attention from the baseless nature of the underlying lawsuit&quot; against the tobacco industry. It noted it had not submitted any claims to its insurers related to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Louisiana filed the petition under the direct action statute, which allows injured parties to directly sue insurance companies that have insured the people or corporations responsible for their injuries. Louisiana is one of the only states with this protection.</p>
<p>In a related matter, a settlement between Liggett Group Inc. and 22 state attorneys general may turn up the heat on the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Liggett, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd., agreed to cooperate with the states in their tobacco probes and to hand over documents. The company also agreed to put a warning label on cigarettes saying smoking is addictive.</p>
