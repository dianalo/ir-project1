<p>Dutch retail and business services group Vendex International NV announced plans on Monday for a 2.5 billion franc takeover of French temporary employment agency BIS SA.</p>
<p>Vendex said it also planned a separate Amsterdam bourse listing for its business services division which consists of temporary help and commercial cleaning units.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of analysts' reactions to the news:</p>
<p>Peter Wortel, Delta Lloyd Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition is a good thing for Vendex and fits in nicely with the group's strategy. The spin-off of the business services division is a good idea as it will give investors a clearer idea about valuation measures such as price-earnings ratios. Vendex consists of three different divisions at the moment and the spin-off will make things clearer. It is a big acquisition...But for Vendex as a whole it is a good step.&quot;  </p>
<p>Arie Gravendeel, Rabo Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Vendex's share of the French temporary help market will increase from three percent to around 17 percent as a result of this deal and that's a good thing. A move in France had been in the air and I'm pleased to see it go ahead. The price they are willing to pay is fine. The French temporary help market is not too strong at the moment, but that is an economic story and it will improve. Then they will be among the first to benefit from the upturn. They should be able to pay for the whole deal from their own resources...The plan to spin off business services should boost the share price.&quot;  </p>
<p>Jurgen Veenker, MeesPierson.</p>
<p>&quot;This looks like a good move to me. Vendex wanted to grow in the services sector and will more than double its turnover in services with this move. BIS has a strong position in France and I expect the French temporary help market to improve. Being big is important to attract both customers and temporary workers... As for the financing, this should not weigh too heavily on Vendex. The sale of the KBB-stake (in 1996) has brought in cash and will enable the company to borrow more easily. We had Vendex on 'hold' but were considering an upgrade. That will probably go ahead after what we've heard today.&quot;  </p>
<p>Keith Wills, Goldman Sachs:</p>
<p>&quot;Vendex is aiming for wider European coverage for temporary work and as such it is a good step. It looks like a good price, they are willing to pay for BIS. The spin-off makes it easier for investors to understand the vehicle...there was no obvious synergy between retail and business services.&quot;</p>
