<title>FRANCE: Fifth French paedophilia suspects commits suicide.</title>

<p>A fifth suspect in France's mass crackdown on paedophilia has committed suicide, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The man, a schoolteacher whose identity was not disclosed, hanged himself in the western town of Royan, north of Bordeaux, after being released from custody and placed under judicial investigation for possession of child sex video cassettes.</p>
<p>&quot;This primary school teacher hanged himself. His body was found on Tuesday,&quot; a gendarmerie officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>The teacher was one of more than 800 people rounded up in a highly publicised nationwide police dragnet last week ordered by a public prosecutor in the town of Macon. Human rights groups and defence lawyers denounced the operation as unnecessarily spectacular.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou suggested this week police and the media had gone overboard on the paedophilia hunt, and government spokesman Catherine Trautmann warned against making a spectacle out of the tragic.</p>
<p>A total of 323 people were placed under investigation, the first step to possible prosecution, and 24 remanded in custody in a nationwide operation involving 2,500 police. Those rounded up included teachers and clergymen.</p>
<p>The highly-publicised raids initially targeted some 800 individuals whose names were found on a computerised mailing list of a firm based in Macon which sold pornographic video cassettes involving under-age boys.</p>
<p>The French League of Human Rights accused investigators of unnecessarily humiliating suspects and using &quot;witch-hunt&quot; tactics. But Macon prosecutor Jean-Louis Coste said human rights activists should be most concerned about children who suffered abuse.</p>
