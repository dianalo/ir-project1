<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Wednesday he was forming a new government of liberal reformers in a reshuffle the Communist opposition branded &quot;ruinous&quot; for Russia and vowed to fight.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, firmly back at the helm after many months of illness, has given the premier one week to reorganise his cabinet. Only Chernomyrdin and new First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais are assured of keeping their jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Professional market economists, firm supporters of the president's course of reforms, will come into the government,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.</p>
<p>The prospect of more free market moves under Chubais, once Russia's privatisation supremo, was enough to drive Moscow's communist-dominated parliament to vote for a furious, though non-binding, motion condemning the reshuffle.</p>
<p>As yet, however, Chernomyrdin has named no names but said new ministers will be under 50 with administrative experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there are all possibilities of forming a united and effective team of serious and responsible professionals,&quot; Chernomyrdin said, adding personnel changes could be announced sooner than the seven-day deadline set by Yeltsin on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament, dominated by Yeltsin's communist and nationalist opponents, approved by 230 votes to 122 a toughly worded resolution condemning the moves.</p>
<p>&quot;The changes carried out in the government again illustrate the desire of the current authorities to continue the ruinous social-economic course which has brought Russia to the brink of catastrophe,&quot; said the resolution. It carries no legal force.</p>
<p>&quot;They are an eloquent testimony to the readiness of the leadership to subject Russia and her vital interests to the diktat of the International Monetary Fund and foreign capital,&quot; said the resolution, drafted by the Communist faction.</p>
<p>Opposition deputies have been particularly enraged by Yeltsin's decision to draft Chubais, a 41-year-old liberal, back into the government to oversee economic reforms. The resolution called his appointment a &quot;direct challenge to social opinion&quot;.</p>
<p>The Duma has limited powers under a 1993 constitution, drawn up after Yeltsin subdued its Soviet-era predecessor with tanks.</p>
<p>Since Chernomyrdin stays put in the reshuffle, the Duma will have no right of review over the new cabinet appointments.</p>
<p>But more seriously, the communists have threatened a general no-confidence motion which, if voted through twice, would force Yeltsin to either dismiss the government or dissolve the Duma.</p>
<p>Given Russia's deep-seated economic and social problems, a fresh election might return an even less cooperative parliament.</p>
<p>Trade unions, backed by the communists, are planning a nationwide day of strikes on March 27 to protest against long delays in the payment of wages and pensions.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department on Tuesday welcomed Yeltsin's changes, saying they showed that Yeltsin was back in control and determined to press on with reforms after many months' absence from the Kremlin due to heart problems and pneumonia.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Interfax news agency on Wednesday that Yeltsin would devote the bulk of his time now, not on the reshuffle, but preparing his Helsinki summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton on March 19 and 20.</p>
<p>Key issues will be European security, including arms limitation, and NATO's plan to expand in eastern Europe -- much against Russia's wishes. Yastrzhembsky said bilateral relations, especially economic matters, were also on the agenda.</p>
<p>Yeltsin would continue to discuss the government shake-up.</p>
<p>&quot;But the ball is now in the prime minister's court. Concrete proposals should come from him,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, chief negotiatior with NATO, is expected to stay on. Another likely to keep his job is Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov. On a trip to Moldova, he said he expected his crime-fighting role to continue unchanged.</p>
