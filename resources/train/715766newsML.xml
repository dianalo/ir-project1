<p>The All Blacks headed for South Africa on Wednesday to begin their defence of the Tri-Nations rugby crown, with coach John Hart describing the next 2-1/2 weeks as the toughest challenge of his two seasons in charge.</p>
<p>New Zealand clash with South Africa at high altitude in Johannesburg on July 19, and then face a demanding trip the day after to Melbourne, where they meet Australia on July 26.  </p>
<p>The All Blacks had an arduous campaign last year, when they finished with four tests in South Africa on successive weekends, but Hart said the itinerary this time made the task harder still.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year was really tough, but we had a test team that was resting between games and there was not a lot of travel,&quot; NZPA reported Hart as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The travel factor this time could be a killer -- going up there and then a day after playing South Africa flying to Melbourne.&quot;  </p>
<p>The All Black management has opted to leave New Zealand a little earlier than usual to allow the 26-strong squad to have a gradual build-up.</p>
<p>For the first three days, the footballs will be put away and the accent will be on fitness work and relaxation. Preparation for the Johannesburg test will start in earnest a week out.</p>
<p>Of new coach Carel du Plessis' the South Africans, Hart believed they were potentially a better side than last year's Springboks.</p>
<p>He felt they should have whitewashed the British Lions rather than losing 1-2 in their just-completed series.  </p>
<p>&quot;They lost the first two tests because of goalkicking and they rectified that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they have more options in the backs than last year and their forward play has advanced. Our match might turn out to be one of the most physical tests we've seen.&quot;</p>
<p>Hart added that the Springboks' second series defeat at home in two years would make them more dangerous opponents.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't help us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But then again, the tri-series is a special competition and both sides will be pretty desperate to get the first one.&quot;  </p>
<p>New Zealand won the inaugural Tri-Nations competition last year with a 100 percent record from their four matches.</p>
<p>They were the only team to secure victories away from home and Hart said doing the same again would be the key to retaining the title.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to win one of these two away matches,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we lose both, it will be virtually impossible for us to win the tri-series.&quot;</p>
<p>The All Blacks' home matches in the competition are in Auckland on August 9 against South Africa and in Dunedin on August 16 against Australia.  </p>
