<p>Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila appealed to the United Nations on Sunday to help 170,000 Hutu refugees who fled a camp his troops overran but said there could be no immediate ceasefire.</p>
<p>&quot;Many hundreds of refugees are coming and our men have been ordered not to harm them...the United Nations is invited to go to Tingi Tingi to help the refugees to return home and help repatriate them,&quot; Kabila told a news conference in the eastern city of Goma.  </p>
<p>Kabila said his forces captured Lubutu, 200 km (125 miles) southeast of Zaire's third largest city Kisangani, and nearby Tingi Tingi after heavy fighting on Saturday afternoon. He said rebel forces could only agree to a ceasefire after direct negotiations with President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>&quot;The refugees were being held hostage by Mobutu's mercenaries and former Rwandan soldiers, they have now been liberated,&quot; Kabila said. He added that he thought the bulk of the refugees were heading towards Kisangani by foot.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't erect another camp, and if the refugees all return to Tingi Tingi they can be helped there while a humanitarian corridor is opened to allow them to return home,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An estimated 170,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees set up a makeshift camp at Tingi Tingi after fleeing camps further east. Zairean rebels have seized a strip of territory 1,000 km (625 miles) long in the east of the country in a campaign against Mobutu's army that started last October.</p>
