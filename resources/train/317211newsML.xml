<title>AUSTRALIA: CRICKET-REIFFEL BACK, BICHEL CALLED UP BY AUSTRALIA.</title>
<headline>CRICKET-REIFFEL BACK, BICHEL CALLED UP BY AUSTRALIA.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-01-19</dateline>

<p>Australia's attack was bolstered on Sunday by the return of Paul Reiffel and the call-up of fellow paceman Andrew Bichel for the fourth test against West Indies.</p>
<p>The selectors were also satisfied that top-order batsman Mark Waugh had recovered sufficiently from a hamstring strain to take his place against a resurgent West Indies for the match starting in Adelaide on Saturday.</p>
<p>Australia took a 2-0 lead early in the five-test series as West Indies endured a seven-match losing streak during a miserable start to their tour.</p>
<p>But West Indies thrashed Australia by six wickets in the third test in Melbourne last month and qualifyied ahead of their hosts for the three-match World Series limited overs final against Pakistan.</p>
<p>Reiffel had not played since suffering a hamstring strain in a World Series match against Pakistan on January 1.</p>
<p>Bichel's outstanding domestic form gave him the chance to replace the injured Jason Gillespie and earn his first test cap. Gillespie suffered a side strain during the third test.</p>
<p>Bichel leads the domestic first-class averages with 29 wickets at an average of 17.48 and has taken five wickets in an innings four times this season. He also played in Australia's last four limited overs matches.</p>
<p>Reiffel will play the first two days of a four-day match for his Victoria state side's second X1 as a final fitness test. Stuart is the most likely replacement should Reiffel fail to prove his fitness.</p>
<p>Waugh strained a hamstring while batting in a limited overs match against West Indies a week ago.</p>
<p>Team from: Mark Taylor, Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Greg Blewett, Michael Bevan, Ian Healy, Paul Reiffel, Shane Warne, Andrew Bichel, Glenn McGrath.</p>
