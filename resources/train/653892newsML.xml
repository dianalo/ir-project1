<p>Shareholders of modem maker U.S. Robotics Corp. and networking company 3Com Corp. Wednesday approved the merger of the two companies in a stock deal now valued at about $8.5 billion.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close on Thursday, June 12, which will also be the last day of trading for U.S. Robotics stock. After that the companies will trade under the 3Com name.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics shareholders will receive 1.75 3Com shares per U.S. Robotics share. After the merger, U.S. Robotics holders will own about 47 percent of the combined company.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight percent of the U.S. Robotics shares were voted in favour of the merger and about 3 percent against. A total of 61.4 percent of all outstanding shares voted.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics said 64 percent of the 123 million 3Com shares voted were in favour. 3Com has 178 million shares oustanding. Special meetings were held simulataneously in Chicago and California, where 3Com has its headquarters.</p>
<p>The merger creates a computer networking company with $5.5 billion in annual revenues and more than 13,000 employees in 45 countries. At this point, U.S. Robotics said it does not expect layoffs.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the merger) will go smoothly but they have to work very hard at it,&quot; said Amar Senan, an analyst for investment bankers Volpe, Welty and Co. &quot;They're operating in very fast-moving markets and they have to work hard to make sure they don't slip.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics, whose modems are on more desktops around the world than any other company's, will lose its name as a company, but the combined organisation will continue to market its products under the U.S. Robotics brand.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics initially came under fire for selling itself cheap in the short-term, and stock of both companies fell significantly in the weeks following the announcement. But both have since rebounded, making the deal worth more than the $7.3 billion initially estimated.</p>
<p>Analysts said the combined entity will take on the networking giant Cisco Systems Inc., which neither company could tackle alone. The merger of Ascend Communications Inc and Cascade Communications Corp. means stiffer competition in the remote access market as well, where U.S. Robotics is currently a leader.</p>
<p>Cowell said the benefits of the merger will surface immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a sales and marketing force in regions of the world we are not present in, and they have the need for the kinds of products we have to offer,&quot; Cowell said. &quot;Those are the kinds of synergies we expect we can begin to see pretty quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics said there were a total of 11 shareholder lawsuits filed against the company in connection with the merger, but all were settled and are not expected to have an impact on the merger or a material financial effect on the company.</p>
<p>Cowell will serve as vice chairman of the combined company and has a two-year contract on the board of directors. A shareholder asked if he plans to stay with the company after that agreement expires, but he did not commit.</p>
