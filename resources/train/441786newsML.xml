<p>German shares tumbled more than two percent in early active bourse trade on Thursday, catching up with losses in IBIS trade from Wednesday and also fresh losses tied to overnight Wall Street losses.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index was down 73.98 points at 3,341.42 points, while the IBIS DAX, which reflects all-day dealings, was down 41.25 points at 3,341.15 points.</p>
<p>Traders said the drop may be the start of a long-awaited market correction in response to the recent heady gains, including a 20 percent rise in the DAX in the last 10 weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's healthy and not much of a worry,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The drop is pretty much in line with what a lot of people have been expecting for some time,&quot; the Frankfurt trader said. &quot;This should help make the market a bit more attractive.&quot;</p>
<p>Chemical shares remained in the spotlight as Hoechst AG kept up its decline from Wednesday tied to disappointment over the shelving of plans for Hoechst to list its Hoechst Marion Roussel pharmaceuticals unit on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>Hoechst shares, which fell 10 percent on Wednesday, were down 1.55 marks at 68.90 marks in bourse trade but off the session low so far at 68.30 marks.</p>
<p>Other chemical sector shares, including Bayer AG, BASF AG and Schering AG, were all also lower in early dealings.</p>
<p>Shares in engineering group Deutz AG slumped 1.75 marks to 12 marks on profit-taking after surging in recent days after a report in Germany's Platow Brief saying the company, formerly known as Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, would return to a profit this year. Deutz plans to release its results on May 15.</p>
<p>Carmaker Volkswagen AG was down 21.50 marks at 930 marks despite a Wall Street Journal report saying its Audi luxury unit was contemplating a U.S. factory site.</p>
