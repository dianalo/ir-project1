<title>VIETNAM: Vietnam abolishes tax on overseas remittances.</title>

<p>The Vietnamese government said on Tuesday it had scrapped a tax on money and gifts sent from overseas following a sharp drop over the past year in remittances going via the national banking system.</p>
<p>State-controlled dailies said the cancellation had been agreed to by a National Assembly committee last week that also raised the threshold for tax on personal incomes to two million dong per month ($179) from 1.2 million ($107).</p>
<p>The tax on remittances -- equivalent to five percent on amounts over two million dong and applied to irregular payments -- was aimed at cashing in on the estimated $1.0 billion that flows into Vietnam each year from overseas Vietnamese.</p>
<p>But Tuesday's newspapers quoted a National Assembly statement that conceded the policy had done more harm than good by encouraging the transfer of money and gifts into Vietnam via unofficial channels.</p>
<p>&quot;...more serious than the fall in money sent through the banks and the post office was the danger of widespread misunderstanding among overseas Vietnamese of the Vietnamese government's intentions,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Western bankers said the tax on remittances had been on Vietnam's statute books for some time before being applied with vigour last year, causing a drop of at least 50 percent in money being sent into Vietnam through the national banking system.</p>
<p>&quot;One bank complained to me they were getting loads of remittances of less than two million dong,&quot; said a foreign banker, referring to the limit below which payments were tax exempt.</p>
<p>An estimated two million Vietnamese live overseas, most of them having fled their homeland as refugees following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.</p>
<p>Hanoi has traditionally regarded overseas Vietnamese with suspicion, but in recent years has been moving to restore relations by encouraging them to participate in the rebuilding of its poverty-stricken and war-ravaged economy.</p>
