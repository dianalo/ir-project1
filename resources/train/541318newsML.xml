<p>Shares were seen opening flat to slightly easier on Friday after U.S. blue chips fell overnight on rate hike jitters and Nokia ended a shade below its Helsinki close, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be about flat or a bit lower today,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Forestry shares would be in focus after a rally on Thursday, and after news that Enso was in talks to buy German paper maker Holtzmann, brokers said.</p>
<p>Ericsson's Q1 earnings report, due in the afternoon, would also be watched as a cue for Nokia, they said. Nokia's Q1 earnings are due for release on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Banks could be interesting after a good result from Alandsbanken ... and as we start looking ahead to Merita's result,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Alandsbanken on Friday morning reported first-quarter operating profit after credit losses up to 13.9 million markka from 11.2 million a year ago.</p>
<p>But brokers said that end-of-week mood as well as caution ahead of Nokia's result and a raft of key U.S. econmic indicators next week could dampen trade.</p>
