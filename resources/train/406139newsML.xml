<p>Gasunie, the Dutch gas monopoly, is prepared for an expected loss of market share in a freer European gas market but believes higher exports and the marketing of its know-how will compensate, Gasune General Managing Director George Verberg said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview Gasunie can and must exploit its long experience of gas supply and transfer its knowledge to growing markets. It will offer services to developing players, notably Gazprom and even market their gas.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will still depend on long established players,&quot; Verberg said.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has been Europe's dominant gas producer since the early 1960s and currently sells 80 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year to Dutch and international distributors.</p>
<p>However, just as the Western European market is set for growth of at least four percent per year as the dash for gas crosses from Britain, the Dutch find themselves overshadowed by larger producers Norway, Russia and Algeria.</p>
<p>Verberg believes domestic and foreign suppliers will eat into Gasunie's market share as the Dutch allow negotiated access and free up larger captive customers.</p>
<p>&quot;I have told my people don't be surprised if we lose 20 percent of the market share,&quot; Verberg says.</p>
<p>He adds that any rising exports could compensate for any loss in domestic sales.</p>
<p>&quot;If we lose market at home, it is envisaged that we will get that amount of volume available for exports,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Gasunie has not yet been relegated to the second league of suppliers. It is confident it can continue selling its 80 bcm per year for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>&quot;We check this every year and every year the producers are coming to us telling that they are having success in finding new reserves,&quot; Verberg says.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to play a reasonable role in trading gas volumes although we will not overstretch our capabilities,&quot; he adds</p>
<p>In January, Gasunie signed an agreement with Ruhrgas to sell 90 bcm for six years for 15 billion guilders.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company signed a letter of intent with Polish Oil and Gas Company to sell an annual two bcm of gas per year. A deal would also involve Gasunie assisting with marketing activities in Poland.</p>
<p>Gasunie are also among a group of companies competing to sell gas to the Czech Republic which wishes to diversify its supply, currenly coming solely from Russia.</p>
<p>In most of its discussions, it plans to offer more than just the gas.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is any request from a market partner in our capabilities, we are willing to make them available... We are selling our know-how,&quot; Verberg says.</p>
<p>The freedom to engage in such deals is partly the result of its agreement with Gazprom, concluded last May. Gasunie will import gas from 2001 for 20 years, originally at a rate of 1 bcm a year, but rising to four.</p>
<p>Gasunie will also provide Gazprom with services including storage, transit and technological support. Verberg even speculated that Gasunie could begin marketing Gazprom's gas to countries such as Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategic alliance with Gazprom is quite a mutually beneficial thing with the two complementing each other's strong points. Gazprom has huge reserves. We think we can add services...That combination could be an interesting match,&quot; Verberg said.</p>
<p>Verberg adopts a neutral but pragmatic stance towards encroaching liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not like rules in themselves. but given the fact that we will have new rules..., it's better to prepare now, as soon as possible. We think we can handle it. We are ready for the new rules,&quot; he says</p>
<p>He did not say how Gasunie intended to combat a wave of cheap gas imports, whether from Britain or elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;You should just wait and see what we do,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Gasunie is 50 percent owned by the Dutch state and 25 percent each by Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon Corp unit Esso.</p>
