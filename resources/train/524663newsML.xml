<headline>Thai baht eases, interbank rate lower late.</headline>

<p>The Thai baht was slightly down against the dollar in late trade on Monday in line with the U.S. currency's movement up abroad, dealers said.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted at 26.057/26.067 to the dollar late compared with 26.050/26.053 in early morning.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing exciting today. The baht/dollar trade was tracking the greenback's direction against the mark and yen,&quot; one dealer at a local bank.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand fixed the mid-rate at 26.06 per dollar against 26.08 on Friday.  </p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate fell to 7.50 percent late from 8.00 in early morning and 7.75-8.00 late on Friday on some inflows of foreign funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some inflows of foreign funds. This helped raise money supply in the banking system,&quot; said one money market dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank's reserve requirement due tommorow was unlikely to have much impact on the liquidity as most banks had already raised sufficient funds.</p>
<p>All commercial banks have to meet the Bank of Thailand's reserve requirement on seventh and 22nd of each month.  </p>
<p>The one-month baht/dollar swap premium was quoted at 5.20/5.70 satangs per dollar late versus 5.00/6.00 in the morning.</p>
