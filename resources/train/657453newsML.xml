<p>September T-bond futures will find solid support around the 110-09,08 area on Thursday from any storms caused by U.S. retail sales data later this session, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>But the recent upmove was looking strained.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at the mature end of this move but there may be 1-1/2 to two points on the upside,&quot; said Norman Beauchamp, head of derivates at Cooperative Bank in London.</p>
<p>T-bonds were at 110-18 at 0954 GMT, down 1/32.</p>
<p>Analysts said initial support came in at at 110-12, the low on June 10 and so far this session but 110-09,08 was key.</p>
<p>The 110-09 level came from the top of the previous range on May 13 while the top of the channel drawn off the December and February highs came in at 110-08, Beauchamp said.</p>
<p>&quot;On June 6 we broke out of the top of the channel and got to the 111-09 area and we've come back to test it,&quot; Beauchamp said. &quot;Now we need to push ahead from here.&quot;</p>
<p>Beauchamp said the first target would be the 111-09 high. Beyond there, the 112-16 area would come into play. That level was a high on February 20, just near the February peak.</p>
<p>Stavros Loizou, manager strategic trading at Fuji Bank in London, put support below 110-08 at 109-27.</p>
<p>&quot;Below that the market is going to target 109-15,&quot; he said. On daily charts 109-27 was the high on May 21, while 109-15 was the low last Friday from where the contract rallied.</p>
<p>September Eurodollars were quoted at 94.025, down 0.005 while December were at 93.810, down 0.005.</p>
<p>U.S. May retail sales at 0830 GMT were forecast to show a rise of 0.4 percent in the month after a 0.3 percent decline in April, according to a survey by Reuters. Excluding autos, sales were seen up 0.3 percent versus a 0.1 percent drop.</p>
