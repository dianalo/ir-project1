<p>Katherine Hensel, director of Chancellor LGT's North American Equity Research team, said he believed major U.S. banks were unlikely to continue to raise their return of equity (ROE), currently around 20 percent.</p>
<p>However, Hensel, a respected and experienced bank analyst in New York, also said that on a relative basis to other banks worldwide, U.S. banks would still &quot;look good,&quot; even if their ROE's would not be growing that much.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be asking a lot to see the ROE go much higher than here,&quot; Hensel told a briefing at the International Monetary Conference (IMC).</p>
<p>She said U.S. banks had experienced a tremendous improvement in their credit quality after the tough time in the late 1980s and had exited the difficult period &quot;over-reserved.&quot;</p>
<p>This had enabled U.S. banks to invest heavily in technology, rather than having to set aside large sums for loan-loss provisions, as many European banks.</p>
<p>She added the top five U.S. banks account for one-third of the totaly spending by U.S. banks on technology.</p>
<p>However, she expected to see some deterioration in credit quality as the slow growth environment widens.</p>
