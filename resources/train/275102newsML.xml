<p>Israeli and Palestinian leaders moved closer to another landmark accord, boosting hopes for Middle East peace on Christmas Day in the land where Jesus was born.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Yasser Arafat met on Tuesday in the Gaza Strip and a senior Israeli official predicted a deal within a week to give Palestinians self-rule in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross extended his three-day-old mission indefinitely, saying that the two leaders, who last met 12 weeks ago, had told negotiators to meet on Christmas morning and that Netanyahu and Arafat would meet again soon.</p>
<p>&quot;We say to our political leaders: Thank you for each positive step towards peace, for all the efforts that were made on this particular day,&quot; Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, a Palestinian, said at a midnight mass joined by Arafat in Bethlehem, Jesus's birthplace.</p>
<p>Israel and the PLO had accused each other of foot-dragging in the talks on an Israeli troop redeployment that would give Palestinians control of 80 percent of Hebron, holy to both Jews and Moslems.</p>
<p>Hebron is the last Israeli-occupied town due for self-rule under peace deals dating back to 1993 between Arafat and Netanyahu's left-centre predecessors. Bethlehem, for instance, was handed over by Israel just before Christmas last year.</p>
<p>The right-wing Netanyahu has conditioned a Hebron agreement on guarantees for the safety of the 400 Jewish settlers in the heart of the town of 100,000 Arabs which was captured by Israel with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Arabs view the long-delayed withdrawal, promised by Israel's former Labour government, as a test of Likud party leader Netanyahu's intentions following his election in May on a promise to take a tough line on the security of Israelis.</p>
<p>&quot;We're speaking about the first agreement between the Likud government of Benjamin Netanyahu and the PLO,&quot; Dore Gold, an adviser to the Israeli leader, told the U.S. Cable News Network, predicting agreement in a &quot;very few days&quot;.</p>
<p>It was an at-times stormy summit with Arafat even threatening to walk out. But Palestinian participants called it a positive turning point in the Netanyahu-Arafat relationship with the Israeli leader voicing understanding for their view.</p>
<p>The pending deal did not sit well with some in Netanyahu's own cabinet, including hawkish former general Ariel Sharon, who said that after seeing the military plans for Hebron for the first time &quot;my worries have only increased&quot;.</p>
<p>Arafat, a Moslem, and his Christian-born wife Suha joined the festivities in Bethlehem, a town of 40,000 Moslem and Christians heavily reliant on a tourism business damaged by a surge this year of Arab-Israeli violence.</p>
<p>Palestinians complain about a closure imposed by Israel on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to two million Palestinians, because of Islamic suicide bombings that killed 59 people in Israel in February and March.</p>
<p>&quot;Our peace will not be established through military machinery, through security measures...through restricting freedoms, demolishing houses or confiscating land to establish settlements on them,&quot; the Latin patriarch said at the mass.</p>
<p>Israel prepared to bury two soldiers killed by pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas in a bomb attack in a south Lebanon occupation zone. Their deaths raised to 27 the number of Israelis killed in Lebanon this year, four more than in 1995.</p>
