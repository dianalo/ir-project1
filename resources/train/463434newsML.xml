<p>Turkish prison inmates clashed with guards on Monday in fighting at a jail in western Turkey which left at least five injured, human rights officials said.</p>
<p>Four guards and one para-military gendarme were taken to hospital from Buca jail in the city of Izmir, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have learned that many prisoners were injured in the fighting between them and the guards and gendarmes,&quot; said Yuksel Alp from the Turkish Human Rights Association.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the prisoners said one guard had also been taken hostage.</p>
<p>Firefighters had to extinguish a fire that apparently broke out in a section of the prison holding members of the left-wing guerilla group Dev Sol, eye-witnesses said.</p>
<p>But Turkish television channel NTV reported that the fighting had died down and negotiations between the prisoners and authorities were in progress.</p>
<p>The state-run Anatolian news agency said left-wing militants were involved in the riot.</p>
<p>Alp said relations between the prison guards and inmates had worsened since guards carried out a search for a suspected escape tunnel in February.</p>
<p>&quot;From that date there has been continuous tension,&quot; he said. Buca houses many leftist and Kurdish rebel prisoners.</p>
