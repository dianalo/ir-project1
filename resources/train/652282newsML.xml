<headline>Funscape to acquire Oilex.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Funscape Corp has agreed to acquire Oilex Inc in exchange for seven million shares, investor Allen Burditt II told Reuters.</p>
<p>He also said this transaction will be followed by the acquisition of 800 oil wells from Rife Oil for additional shares.</p>
<p>A formal announcement of the transactions is expected in about an hour.</p>
<p>After both mergers, Burditt said, he will hold about 2.5 million Funscape shares, roughly 15 percent of the 13.2 million expected to be outstanding.  </p>
<p>Burditt said another 2.5 million shares will be held by Sawyer Adecor, while Rife Oil will hold about 2 million shares and Oliver Timmons one million.</p>
<p>Burditt said Funscape has agreed to exchange one share for each 5.1 outstanding Oilex shares.</p>
<p>At Funscape's Tuesday closing price of $4.25 a share, the proposal values Oilex stock at $0.83 per share. The stock closed Tuesday at 21/32.</p>
<p>Burditt said the merger is expected to be a tax-free transaction and pointed out that the new company will also acquire Oilex's $6.5 million tax loss carryforward.  </p>
<p>Funscape is the owner of Oil Retrieval Systems Inc, the maker of the portable swabbing units used by Oilex to produce shallow, low volume oil wells.</p>
<p>Oilex held 20 percent of Oil Retrieval before that company was acquired by Funscape for 2.5 million shares last month.</p>
<p>The Oilex stake was acquired in January as part of an agreement giving the company a 30-day preferential first right of refusal to all portable swabbing units Oil Retrieval built on speculations, without prior orders.  </p>
<p>That agreement also gave Oil Retrieval a 25 percent interest in Oilex's Revilo unit in exchange for providing a minimum of three portable swabbing units in 1997.</p>
<p>Funscape's annoucement of the acquisition quoted its president, M.O. Rife III as saying, &quot;The combination of the companies with their technology, producing properties and combined oil and gas manufacturing and management expertise allows for a fully integrated synergistic application of resources.&quot;</p>
<p>The merger will create a company elgible to trade on Nasdaq's small caps market, Burditt said.  </p>
<p>Oilex director Ricard Clark said in the &quot;worst case&quot; the company should have production of 5,000 barrels per day from its swabbing operations resulting in revenues from that source alone of $20 million a year.</p>
<p>Clark said he has accepted an invitation to serve on the merged company's board.</p>
<p>He told Reuters the company has found a new facility that will let it double production of the portable swabbing units by year end -- to a pace of six per month.  </p>
<p>After the merger transaction is completed, Burditt said, the company will be &quot;ready to get a line of credit to fund infill drilling&quot; in the fields it controls.</p>
<p>The company now has 1,400 infill drilling sites.</p>
<p>Clark noted this is a very low risk form of oil drilling which increases the number of wells in a developed area to the maximum allowed by local regulations.</p>
<p>He said there are 10,000 abandoned wells in Texas alone which could be produced with portable swabbing technology.  </p>
<p>On a daily basis, or as wells dictate, the portable swabbing unit lowers, by cable, swabbing tools inside the casing of a well bore to a depth where fluid is encountered and pulls (swabs) 4 to 5 barrels of oil, gas and water back to the surface through a housing on the unit and delivers the fluids to the unit's 40 or 70 barrel holding tank.</p>
<p>Oilex said this procedure takes about ten minutes.</p>
<p>To accomplish the same by conventional means takes up to 24 hours, it points out.</p>
<p>Once the new company is swabbing 1,000 wells per day, Clark continued, its cost will be less than $4 per barrel.</p>
<p>In the future, Burditt said, the company will look at leasing the portable swabbing units to other operator for $4,000 to $5,000 per month and providing operating expertise in return for a piece of the lease being operated.</p>
<p>&quot;I do want (the company) to be an acquisition target a year and a half out,&quot; Burditt concluded.</p>
