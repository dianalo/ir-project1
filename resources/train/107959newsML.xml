<title>MEXICO: Mexico peso closes weak in late trade on dlr cover.</title>
<headline>Mexico peso closes weak in late trade on dlr cover.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Mexican peso closed below the 7.60 psychological barrier on Thursday in heavy trade, as foreign investors sold pesos to cash in on rising U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Dealers said locals were forced to cover their dollar positions when foreigners began buying dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors stepped in to buy dollars in the morning and settled deals with locals who had none to sell, so the (locals) put the market under pressure when they had to cover in late trade,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed down three and 2.1 centavos, respectively, at 7.6165/7.6190 and 7.6010/7.6060 per dollar.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think that volume today was among the heaviest for the year, it was too much, there were several orders of $100 million each,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield was up to 6.89 percent as the foreign exchange market was closing in Mexico, compared to 6.80 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Demand for dollars was particularly heavy in the 48-hour market, as they would not have to be paid for until next Tuesday, after Monday's public holiday in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;Many dealers sold dollars in the same-day market and bought them back at 48 hours,&quot; a trader said, adding that this often happens on Thursdays.</p>
<p>Traders expected the peso to remain around 7.63 per dollar on Friday as some dealers had yet to cover dollar positions at the close on Thursday.</p>
<p>They finally noted that they awaited the reaction of the U.S. long bond to Friday's publication of U.S. producer prices.</p>
