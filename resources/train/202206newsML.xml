<p>South Africa is looking to lease out more oil storage capacity as large crude stockpiles, built up during the apartheid era, are run down, the managing director of the Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kobus van Zyl told Reuters that a long-awaited environmental impact study on storing crude at the Saldanha Bay tank farm should be complete early next year.</p>
<p>After that, a similar study will be conducted into the feasibility of storing refined oil products at the SFF's 12-million-barrel Milnerton storage tanks on the outskirts of Cape Town.</p>
<p>Van Zyl said South Africa aimed to reduce its 49 million barrel stockpile to internationally accepted norms of three months' supply.</p>
<p>Energy minister Penuell Maduna said earlier this month the government would cut the stockpile to 90 days' supply, or 36 million barrels. But Van Zyl said the actual figure would be 39 million barrels -- a more up-to-date estimate of consumption.</p>
<p>Iran last year indicated that it might be interested in leasing 15 million barrels of the 45 million barrels of oil storage space at Saldanha.</p>
<p>The deal was held up by local communities' insistence that an environmental impact study be undertaken to ensure that delicate wetlands around the harbour would not be affected by tanker traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not negotiating with the Iranians at the moment, we are trying to get that environmental impact assessment behind us, and after that we will start talking to the Iranians,&quot; Van Zyl said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the oil market today, they (the Iranians) don't need it. But after today, there is tomorrow, and one never knows.&quot;</p>
<p>The Milnerton tank farm is one of the two tank farms SFF owns in Cape Town and Van Zyl said it was now being gradually emptied so that it could be commercialised and leased out, possibly to an international client.</p>
<p>The other SFF tank farm at Killarney is already leased by Caltex to store crude and product.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not at the moment actively looking for customers for Milnerton, but it is the intention in future to do that,&quot; Van Zyl said.</p>
<p>The 12-million-barrel tank farm was built 30 years ago and currently has a replacement cost of about 500 million rand. Van Zyl said that it was likely that the environmental study would take a year and that the tank farm would be leased out in 1998.</p>
<p>Because of the shallowness of Cape Town harbour, which is not suitable for very large crude carriers (VLCCs), Van Zyl said that it was probable that Milnerton would be used to store refined product, which was transported in smaller vessels.</p>
<p>Van Zyl said that SFF had conducted a &quot;fairly comprehensive&quot; study into the demand for tank farms and there was &quot;a lot of international interest in the tank farm by traders etcetera&quot;.</p>
<p>Van Zyl said surplus oil stocks were gradually being sold off to Natref -- the inland refinery owned by Sasol and Total -- and SFF should reach the 39 million barrel target some time next year.</p>
<p>The oil being sold off was from stocks kept at underground coal mines at Ogies and the aim was to eventually have 29 million barrels stored at Saldanha and 10 million barrels at Ogies, he said.</p>
