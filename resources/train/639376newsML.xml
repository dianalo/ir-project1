<p>British glassmaker Pilkington Plc has a lot to prove over the next 12 months but could make a brave long-term bet, analysts said on Thursday, after fragile European markets pegged the company's 1996/97 earnings back sharply.</p>
<p>Pilkington's share price slumped almost five percent, after it reported pre-tax profits of 132 million pounds ($215.4 million) and warned that price levels had suffered from overcapacity in its core European markets.</p>
<p>But after meeting the company to discuss the results analysts said that, provided it delivers promised cost cuts, the news is not all bad.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a stock for widows and orphans but there are funds out there who invest for the long term. You've got to forget the next 12 months. On that basis there is value present,&quot; said Credit Lyonnais Laing's Michael Ruby.</p>
<p>Pilkington appointed Paolo Scaroni chief executive last month, with a mandate to slash billion pound overheads and boost both profits and cash returns.</p>
<p>There was little evidence of progress after his first 15 days in the job, but analysts said the group expected cost cutting benefits to emerge during the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Finance director Andrew Robb earlier told Reuters in an interview that Pilkington had failed to uphold all of a 20 percent price hike it imposed in April -- although he planned to raise prices again this summer.</p>
<p>This news, together with the company's sober assesment of prevailing market conditions, was sufficient to knock sentiment but ought not drive the stock down much further.</p>
<p>&quot;The share price fall has been a fair reaction and it's now around the right sort of levels, judged on the temper of the meeting,&quot; said Andrew Melrose at Paribas Capital Markets.</p>
<p>By 1145 GMT, the stock had slipped seven pence to 116-118 pence on volumes of over 12 million shares.</p>
<p>But Melrose said the economics were swinging in Pilkington's favour and saw grounds for modest optimisim.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no new capacity coming on-stream and utilisation levels are running close to full strength. As business volumes pick up, we should detect a greater firmness of prices.&quot;</p>
<p>Pilkington said it would hike prices by eight percent on July 1 -- a move which Robb hoped would help double operating margins from present weak levels of 4.0-5.0 percent, placing them on a par with rival Compagnie de Saint Gobain SA.</p>
<p>Melrose, looking past the difficults of the current year, forecast a target share price of 145 pence if these benefits began to surface. The stock has lost around a pound since September last year.</p>
