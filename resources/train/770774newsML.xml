<title>SWEDEN: Hoarding lifts Swedish Match's July sales.</title>
<headline>Hoarding lifts Swedish Match's July sales.</headline>

<p>Swedish tobacco company Swedish Match said on Thursday that hoarding ahead of an August 1 tax hike on tobacco in Sweden boosted its domestic cigarette sales by 50-60 percent in July.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate hoarding lifted sales by 50-60 percent compared to a normal July month when we sell between 650 and 700 million cigarettes,&quot; Swedish Match spokesman Bo Aulin said.</p>
<p>The effects of hoarding was just as large for pipe tobacco and rolling tobacco, maybe even greater, Aulin told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hoarding affected sales of moist tobacco less, by 15-20 percent, partly because it is perishable and therefore hard to store, he said.</p>
<p>When Swedish tobacco tax rises on August 1 Swedish Match will raise cigarette prices by an additional 11 percent to 5.28 crowns a packet, lifting the price of a packet of Blend brand by a total of 22 percent to 44.50 crowns in the store.</p>
<p>Aulin expects the rise to decrease sales volumes by 10-15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are counting on a price flexibility on cigarettes of 0.6 percent which with a price hike of more than 20 percent would give a fall in sales volumes by 10-15 percent,&quot; Aulin said.</p>
<p>Swedish Match has also raised cigarette prices as the stronger dollar makes raw materials more expensive. The company hopes that it will be able to compensate for the expected tax-related fall in sales.</p>
<p>&quot;The price hike is probably not enough to compensate for the fall (in sales) but hopefully there is a transfer to other products, mainly snuff and rolling tobacco, so we hope to keep or maybe even strengthen profitability,&quot; Aulin said.</p>
