<p>The dollar should remain firm if slightly lower until the end of June, but is likely to edge down over the longer term, leading economists predicted in a Reuters poll released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The forecasts, from 29 private economists in Tokyo and London, produced an average forecast for the dollar level at the end of June of 122.52 yen. The greenback stood at about 127 yen in early afternoon trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted from April 1 to April 4.</p>
<p>Some of the economists cautioned that dollar rises since the survey was conducted could skew their forecasts slightly upwards. The dollar hit 127.16 yen on Thursday morning in Tokyo, the highest since August 1992.</p>
<p>The survey covered 33 brokerages and research bodies, although not all those polled responded to all questions.</p>
<p>Most economists said that one of the most important factors determining the dollar's level was U.S interest rates, with recent economic data spurring speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve could follow last month's interest rate rise with yet another tightening relatively soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. could well see another rate rise, perhaps even in May. But as this takes effect, the pace of U.S. economic growth may slow, weakening the greenback later in the year,&quot; said Joji Iguchi, an economist at NLI Research Institute.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve raised rates on March 25, when, in a widely expected move, it increased its Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent.</p>
<p>NLI predicted a dollar rate of 118.00 yen at the end of June, 115.00 yen at the end of September and 112.00 yen at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Hideki Naito, an economist with MMS International, said U.S. interest rates could well lead the market, and agreed that any further tightening could spark sales of U.S. Treasury bonds, weakening the dollar.</p>
<p>Combined with a gradual improvement in the Japanese economy, this was likely to help boost the yen a bit, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the rise in Japan's consumption tax may cool economic growth for a time, the impact is likely to wear off towards the end of the year,&quot; he said. The tax was raised to five percent from three percent on April 1.</p>
<p>MMS International predicted that the dollar would be near 122 yen by the end of June, although Naito said this forecast might have to be revised up, perhaps to 123 yen. But he said an end-September forecast of 120.00 yen and end-December forecast of 115.00 yen were likely to remain largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Economists said they would also be watching Japan's current-account surplus. The February surplus, announced Monday, rose 15.4 percent to 865.2 billion yen ($6.86 billion) from a year earlier and followed a rise in January, the first in 17 months.</p>
<p>Not everyone predicted a weaker dollar.</p>
<p>Jesper Koll, head of research at J.P. Morgan, said rock-bottom Japanese interest rates are likely to keep on promoting a flow of capital overseas as Japanese investors seek higher interest rates, thereby pushing the dollar higher.</p>
<p>&quot;In spite of a marginal increase in the current account surplus, it will be capital flows (overseas) which will drive the market... The yen will only strengthen when the Bank of Japan (BOJ) raises its interest rates faster than the Fed does, and that is unlikely over the next nine to 12 months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan forecast the dollar at 127 yen by the end of June, 130 yen by the end of September and 127.00 yen by the year-end.</p>
<p>The highest forecast for the end of June was 127.50 yen and the lowest 115.00 yen. Mean average forecasts showed the dollar at 120.62 yen at the end of September and 117.74 yen at the end of December.</p>
