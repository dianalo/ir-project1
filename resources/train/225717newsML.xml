<p>Thousands of protesting farmers cut Greece's main north-south road and rail links for a second day on Friday to push demands for higher produce prices and fuel subsidies.</p>
<p>The farmers blocked the national highway and railway near the central town of Larissa with 5,000 tractors, cutting off almost all land traffic between Athens and Greece's second city of Salonika in the north, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are gradually taking over the smaller streets through which we have been diverting motorists,&quot; a police official said.</p>
<p>The farmers, who began the blockade on Thursday, said they would keep up their protest until their demands were met.</p>
<p>Hard-hit by low produce prices set by the European Union, the farmers have blocked the highway in three other points and called for a meeting with socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis.</p>
<p>&quot;This mockery must stop now,&quot; Yannis Pattakis, a farmers' union leader in Larissa told reporters. &quot;This is a survival issue and we demand an immediate solution or we will stay here for as long as it takes.&quot;</p>
<p>Similar blockades in March last year cut the country in half for more than two weeks and ended only after a personal plea by late socialist prime minister Andreas Papandreou.</p>
<p>On Friday, television showed a sea of tractors and hundreds of farmers holding up traffic outside Larissa. Many farmers flew black flags and lit fires in the streets to combat freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>Simitis turned down the demand for a meeting but sent two ministers to Larissa to start negotiations with the protesters.</p>
<p>The farmers want a reduction of value added tax (VAT) on tractors and lower prices for fertiliser, petrol and seeds.</p>
<p>They also want higher price-supports for produce, especially cotton, and a settlement of debts of farmers' cooperatives with the state Agricultural Bank amounting to $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Stephanos Tzoumakas said the protests were politically motivated by the conservative and communist opposition parties.</p>
<p>The nationwide farmers' protests and strikes on Thursday by labour unions to protest against the 1997 budget, unveiled on Friday, was the first tough challenge for Simitis since he won elections in September.</p>
<p>Much of Greece ground to a halt on Thursday during a 24-hour general strike by thousands of workers disrupting transport, schools, hospitals and public services.</p>
<p>National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou said the budget would be the toughest in 15 years as Greece struggles to get its economy in line with its EU partners.</p>
<p>Simitis has said his priority is to join European monetary union (EMU) by 2001, two years after the main core of European Union states plans to launch the Euro single European currency.</p>
<p>Papandoniou has vowed to tax the wealthy hard but he has rejected requests from organised labour to ease economic burdens on lower-paid workers.</p>
