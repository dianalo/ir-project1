<p>Brazil's coffee council is moving in favor of lending government coffee stocks to the domestic soluble industry in answer to complaints it cannot afford to buy coffee at current high prices, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have some coffee stocks which we didn't get rid of in recent auctions and this would be a solution for us to dispose of it,&quot; said Mauricio Assis, head of the primary commodities department at the Industry and Commerce Industry.</p>
<p>The quantity in question could be up to 770,000 60-kg bags although this figure has yet to be finalised, Assis said after a meeting of council members.</p>
<p>The government would lend soluble industries the poorer-quality coffee over a maximum of three years and would be repaid in kind, charging an interest rate which has to be set.</p>
<p>The final plan will depend on Brazil's National Monetary Council which was due to discuss the idea at a meeting today.</p>
<p>&quot;We are against a special auction directed exclusively at the soluble industry and therefore these loans are the best solution,&quot; said Gilson Ximenes, president of the growers' National Coffee Council.</p>
<p>Soluble coffee makers would in addition have to invest five percent of the total value of the coffee in marketing abroad.</p>
<p>The next formal session of council, known as the CDPC, is tentatively scheduled for July 14 in Santos, Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>At the CDPC meeting the Agriculture Ministry will present its new crop-forecasting system which should be in place in time for the 1998/99 crop.</p>
<p>The primary commodities department of the Industry and Commerce Ministry will also present a report on the future management of the government warehouse network.</p>
<p>This weekend an armed gang stole 2,000 bags of coffee from a government warehouse in Parana state.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be even more careful than we are because some of these warehouses are near to the border with Paraguay,&quot; Assis said.</p>
