<title>USA: Subdued mortgage-backed mart down pre-Greenspan.</title>
<headline>Subdued mortgage-backed mart down pre-Greenspan.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-21</dateline>

<p>Discount mortgage coupons were off as much as 5/32 late Monday, while current coupons were down 3/32 to 4/32 in light activity ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress.</p>
<p>Market players said the day's activity was subdued in anticipation of Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins address Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Greenspan will offer his semi-annual remarks about the economy and monetary policy to a House Banking subcommittee on Tuesday and to the Senate Banking panel on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;It has been lethargic at best. We are not seeing much,&quot; said a New York trader.</p>
<p>Dale Westhoff, director of mortgage research at Bear Stearns &amp; Co Inc., said there has been good two-way activity, indicating an absence of consensus among participants when it comes to the future of interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of two-way flows. There is a lot of disagreement,&quot; he said, adding that participants who are &quot;even mildly bullish&quot; on Treasuries are moving down in coupon or buying Treasuries.</p>
