<headline>HK blue chips close modestly up, H-shares soar.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hong Kong stocks closed modestly higher on Wednesday after trading sideways throughout most of the day as the market took a breather following hefty gains over the previous five sessions, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index rose 26.57 points, or 0.20 percent, to close at 13,605.91 after see-sawing between 13,533 and 13,649.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading has been kept in a narrow range today,&quot; said Ben Kwong, director of research at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>But the H-share index set a record closing high of 1,143.43 points, up 32.88 points, or 2.96 percent. Brokers said the China firms benefited from rotational buying as blue chips lost steam.</p>
<p>&quot;Some funds are seen shifting to China enterprises (H-shares) from banking and property stocks,&quot; Kwong said.</p>
<p>Blue chips had accumulated gains and now should see some consolidation, he said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index has risen 1,005.49 points or 7.98 percent in the last six sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;A correction is possible but the Hang Seng should see firm support at 13,200,&quot; said Tony Yung, research director at Tai Fook Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Brokers said Wednesday's large trading volume showed market momentum remained strong.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$14.76 billion compared with HK$15.40 billion on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yung noted some investors sold expensive red chips for H-shares that have lagged behind the recent market rise.</p>
<p>Guangdong Investment eased HK$0.05 to HK$7.10.</p>
<p>Tianjin Bohai led the H-share gainers with a rise of HK$0.19 to HK$1.12.</p>
<p>Jilin Chemical jumped HK$0.15 to HK$1.57. Brokers said the shares were boosted by rumours over a possible asset injection following a group reorganisation.</p>
<p>Late buying pushed up leading blue chip HSBC Holdings by HK$2.00 to an all-time closing high of HK$207.00.</p>
<p>Cheung Kong added HK$0.50 to HK$73.50 and Great Eagle rose HK$0.40 to HK$26.50.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Telecom edged up HK$0.10 to HK$14.20 on buying carried over from Tuesday. Brokers said renewed rumours that a Hong Kong blue chip or China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications might take a stake in the utility encouraged buyers.</p>
<p>May Hang Seng Index futures were unchanged at 13,620 and June contracts advanced 10 points to 13,660.</p>
