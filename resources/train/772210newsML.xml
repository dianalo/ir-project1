<p>Poor farmers in a downtrodden patch  of southeastern Mexico on Friday threatened to join a mob of vigilantes  who rounded up 17 alleged criminals this week and burned their homes.</p>
<p>In a revenge spree this week for a spate of crop thefts, hundreds  of villagers in the community of Independencia held the 17 men for  20 hours before they were rescued by state police and turned over  to Tabasco state authorities.</p>
<p>The assualt began on Wednesday when five homes belonging to the suspects  were set ablaze.</p>
<p>In five neighbouring villages in an area known as C-17 Plan Chontalpa,  locals enraged over the increase in petty crime threatened to set  up their own armed vigilante mobs to join those in Independencia.</p>
<p>&quot;We know who they are and we're going to get together to begin to  catch them ourselves,&quot; Ovidio de la Cruz Surita, representative of  some 7,000 families in the area, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Authorities in Villahermosa, the state capital of Tabasco some 30  miles (48 km) northwest of Cardenas, confirmed that vigilante attacks  were on the rise, and said they were deciding whether to prosecute  the ringleaders.</p>
<p>The original incident, in Independencia, almost boiled over into lynchings  when villagers caught the 17 they suspected of assaults, robberies  and the stealing of crops.</p>
<p>&quot;We want justice. We don't want them here,&quot; Jose Garica Garcia, elected  leader of Indepedencia, told Reuters on Thursday. Garcia, however,  was not a member of the mob.</p>
<p>Tabasco is a tropical state near the Yucatan peninsula, where corn  and sugar cane are key crops. But land is scarce and polluted as a  result of intense oil drilling in the region by state oil monopoly  Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex).</p>
<p>Attempted lynchings have become the latest form of score-settling.  Earlier this year three alleged thieves were taken from their homes,  beaten, doused with gasoline and nearly set alight.</p>
<p>Villagers on Thursday said the band's recent attack on a married couple  was the last straw in an alleged crime spree.</p>
<p>After rounding up the 17 men, the mob took them to the centre of town,  where a list of allegations was read publicly and the men declared  guilty. It was then that police intervened, witnesses said.</p>
