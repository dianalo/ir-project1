<p>State-owned Air Tanzania Ltd's (ATC) chairman has rejected talk of merging with Uganda Airlines and Alliance Air because there are currently no legal provisions to allow it.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot merge because there is a law -- an act which established Air Tanzania and it does not allow a merger. The law is still operational unless the parliament amends the law,&quot; ATC chairman Abbas Sykes told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said a merger deal with ATC should involve a reputable international carrier such as Deutsche Lufthansa AG or British Airways Plc.</p>
<p>&quot;That would be ideal -- they've got the muscle. You cannot survive if you are both weak,&quot; he said. He cited the partnership between Kenya Airways and Royal Dutch Airlines KLM as a good example of the sort preferred by the ATC board.</p>
<p>Sykes spoke in reaction to a proposal last month endorsed by Tanzanian Transport Minister William Kusila for a merger of the national carriers of Uganda and Tanzania with Alliance Air, which Uganda and Tanzania own with South African Airways.</p>
<p>The proposal has been greeted with strong opposition by ATC's board who claim the deal could embroil ATC in a massively loss-making venture.</p>
<p>Sykes denied claims that the ATC board would resign if the merger went ahead, saying the board was unified in its opposition and would &quot;fight it out&quot;. He said the merger proposal was frought with risk because the airline's losses over two years of operation exceeded $20 million.</p>
<p>&quot;In less than two years they've made losses more than $20 million -- their aircraft are leased -- there's no profit,&quot; Sykes said. The ATC chairman said of the three airlines, only ATC owned its own aircraft, two short/medium haul Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft and a 60's vintage Fokker, F-27 turbo-prop.</p>
<p>&quot;Take Kenya -- they will benefit quite a lot from KLM. There's transfer of technology, employment and training. But Alliance?,&quot; Sykes added.</p>
<p>He said the wrangle over the merger had delayed moves for ATC's privatisation which he saw as now taking place &quot;sometime next year.&quot; He said the transport ministry's enthusiasm in pushing for a merger was curious given the government's stated aim to let the private sector run the economy.</p>
<p>The concept of a regional airline merger dates back about three years, Sykes said. The original proposal sought a merger of national carriers of Southern Africa Development Community nations in order to compete with major international airlines.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Uganda Airlines, Alliance Air or the governments of Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
