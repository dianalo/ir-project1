<p>IPE Brent futures trundled along at slightly lower levels in a thin, featureless market on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>June IPE Brent was four cents lower at $18.23 a barrel at 1422 GMT, while May gas oil was $1.75 higher at $167.50.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not very exciting,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said there had been a small amount of arbitrage play at the open of NYMEX.</p>
<p>&quot;A few U.S. players came into buy Brent,&quot; said one trader, &quot; The June-June spread was at 1.70 cents a minute ago, the highest it's been over the past four to five days.&quot;</p>
<p>Bar the arbitrage and spread plays there was very little in the market to give it some focus, traders said.</p>
<p>Most, however, were keenly awaiting American Petroleum Institute (API) U.S. oil stock data due to be released late on Tuesday after the IPE has closed for the day.</p>
<p>In the week ended April 18, API data showed U.S. crude stocks rose 1.38 million barrels to 312.79 barrels, while distillate stocks fell 4.68 million barrels to 96.30 million barrels and gasoline stocks fell 1.95 million barrels to 194.59 million barrels.</p>
