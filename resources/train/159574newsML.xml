<p>By Peter Campbell*</p>
<p>As GEORGE SNOW said on Lord Howe Island on Wednesday, just owning the fastest maxi yacht in Australia dosen't automaticaly assure you of breaking long-standing race records.</p>
<p>You need fresh winds in your favour all the way.</p>
<p>That certainly wasn't the case in the Fujitsu Gosford to Lord Howe Island Yachting Classic in which Snows maxi Brindabella took line honours, but 24 hours outside Helsal II's race record of 40 hours for the 408 nautical mile course across the Tasman Sea.</p>
<p>With light winds almost all the way, it was the slowest race race since 1983.</p>
<p>&quot;But it does encourage you to be back again next year.... and that's our plan with Brindabella,&quot; the Capital Properties director said at the open-air trophy presentation under Lord Howe Island's unique kentia palms.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from that, Lord Howe Island is one of the two greatest destinations in the world for an ocean passage race,&quot; Snow added after accepting the historic Pine Trees' Lord Howe Island Cup.</p>
<p>The outer favoured destination, of course, is Hobart where Snow is hoping for stronger winds to crack that record that has stood for 21 years.</p>
<p>Snow and his crew had great expectations of an early finish soon after the fleet set sail from Broken Bay on Saturday in a fresh south-easter.</p>
<p>The GPS was giving them at ETA of ten o'clock Sunday night.</p>
<p>They finally crossed the line at 5am Tuesday.</p>
<p>The slow race favoured the older yachts, with the added bonus of a variable cruiser/racer allowance.</p>
<p>First place in the IMS category went to Morning Tide, an S&amp;S35 owned by ALLAN FENWICK, one of only two yachts representing the Gosford Sailing-Club which runs the race to lord Howe Island.</p>
<p>Morning Tide was launched in 1974, the same year that the annual race to the island was first held.</p>
<p>Second place went to Polaris, a Cole 43 owned by JOHN QUINN, the &quot;man overboard&quot; survivor of the galeswept 1993 sydney to Hobart, third to Impeccable, whose owner/skipper JOHN WALKER is now in his early 70s.</p>
<p>So the good news is that Brindabella will be back again and so will the sponsors.</p>
<p>Yachting enthusiast, JOHN McINERNEY, general manager of Fujitsu ISTG, again sailed in the race, this year with WARWICK SHERMAN aboard A-Crewed Interest, and at the trophy presentation announced ongoing support for the race.</p>
<p>CYCA COMMODORE MISSED THE BOAT</p>
<p>A very late and disappointing withdrawal from the Lord Howe Island Race was Cruising Yacht club of Australia Commodore PETER BUSH with his fast Elliott 55, Ranger.</p>
<p>Bush who is marketing manager with Arnotts, apparently had to cancel his first race to the island because of unexpected business commitments.</p>
<p>He had planned to present a crystal dish to the community of Lord Howe Island in appreciation of their support for the yacht race. Instead, he asked George snow to make the presentation to the Lord Howe Island Board CEO, Mrs JUDY MORTLOCK, herself a strong supporter of the event.</p>
<p>LEXCEN CUP HELD BY WESTERN AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>The Lexcen Cup interstate fleet racing championship sailed each year on the Swan River has been won against by Western Australia, with its crew skippered by DAVID CLARKE, the former New Zealand America's Cup sailor who now lives in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Tasmania finished second and New South Wales third, an exceptional effort by a crew of teenage sailors from the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club led by 17 year-old skipper JAMES SPITHILL.</p>
<p>The regatta, which commemorates the late BEN LEXCEN, designer of America's Cup winner Australia II, is continuing this weekend with match-racing for the Lexcen Shield.</p>
<p>ENTRIES CLOSE FOR SYDNEY TO HOBART</p>
<p>Today is the deadline for lodging of applications to enter this year's Telstra Sydney to Hobart race, with the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia expecting a late rush from yacht owners.</p>
<p>In fact, the club expects that applications from some ovrseas competitors and forgetful locals will still be &quot;in the mail&quot; next week.</p>
<p>Once they have been accepted by the CYCA Sailing Committee as eligible to compete in the 630 natuical mile Category 1 safety race, owners have until the end of November to lodge an official entry.</p>
<p>One boat that is now unlikely to compete is the Whitbread 60, Elle Racing, which Sydney sailor ADRIENNE CAHALAN and her all-women crew are using to train for their Whitbread Round the World late next year.</p>
<p>The CYCA won't accept the entry unless it complies with all the rules of the Sydney to Hobart and that includes having a valid IMS certificate (to verify stability requirements) and sailing without using the water ballast that is allowable in the Whitbread Race.</p>
<p>Water ballast is not acceptable under CYCA rules on the grounds that it gives an unfair advantage to W60 against convential ocean racers.</p>
<p>Another yacht not heading for Hobart this yar is Infinity III, owned by Sydney solicitory MARTIN JAMES.</p>
<p>Infinity III, the former Brindabella, will be heading north in the Royal Alfred Yacht Club's Pittwater to Coffs Harbour Race which starts on December 27.</p>
<p>RPAYC Commodore BRUCE STAPLES was among the competitors in the Lord Howe Island race, sailing his much-travelled Farr 40, Witchcraft II, and he is confident of a fleet of more than 100 yachts trading north to Coffs Harbour this year.</p>
<p>Staples was joined by the Alfreds' immediate past Commodore, RICHARD HUDSON, sailing Indian Pacific, and John Quinn with Polaris, in winning the Lord Howe Island race Club Team trophy against teams from Gosford Sailing Club, Middle Harobur Yacht Club and the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia.</p>
<p>GASCOIGNE CUP WIN TO ARABESQUE</p>
<p>While the small fleet was heading off to Lord Howe Island last Saturday, more than 70 yachts were contesting the Gascoigne Cup, the historic short ocean race held each year by the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron.</p>
<p>Winner was Arabesque, a Holld 43 skippered by PHIL WATTS, who is also chairman of the Squadron's offshore committee and a strong supporter of the successful combined clubs offshore racing programme.</p>
<p>Runner-up, in an excellent performance, was Aspect Computing, skippered by David Pescud and sailed by a crew all suffering from some form of physical disabilities, from Parkinson's disease to the bowman who is a double leg amputee.</p>
