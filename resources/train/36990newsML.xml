<title>ROMANIA: Romania and Hungary sign military pact.</title>

<p>Romania and Hungary signed a military security accord on Friday boosting ties between the armies of the two once uneasy neighbours.</p>
<p>The pact, which calls for notification of military movements and exercises close to their borders, was signed in the western city of Arad by Romanian defence minister Gheorghe Tinca and his Hungarian counterpart Gyorgy Keleti.</p>
<p>The accord comes 10 days before the two countries are due to sign an overall friendship treaty that should end years of disputes over the status of the large Hungarian minority in Romania.</p>
<p>While Budapest expressed concern for the welfare of its 1.6 million kinfolk Bucharest worried that granting rights to ethnic Hungarians would lead to Yugoslav-style secession. The treaty, to be signed in Timisoara, should end such mutual doubts.</p>
<p>Tinca hailed the military accord as evidence of the two countries' maturing relationship and suitability for NATO membership, a major foreign policy goal for both nations.</p>
<p>&quot;It is worth telling (NATO) capitals about what we have achieved, about the fact there is a political process in full progress between our two countries,&quot; the independent Mediafax news agency reported Tinca as saying at the meeting.</p>
<p>Although rows over Hungarian rights have soured relations since both countries rejected communism in 1989, economic links have grown and the two countries' armies have been quietly cooperating.</p>
