<p>India's central bank has directed the country's banks to freeze all the accounts of 40 firms belonging to the CRB group of companies, which failed in May.</p>
<p>&quot;The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today advised all commercial banks to take the necessary action as indicated in the order of the High Court of Delhi,&quot; the RBI said in a statement issued late on Saturday.</p>
<p>Thousands of investors lost their savings when the CRB group of companies, with interests spanning financial services, textiles and building materials, collapsed last month.</p>
<p>Federal investigators have placed its liabilities at 9.3 billion rupees, and said recently they hoped to wind up their inquiry into the group's affairs by the end of August.</p>
<p>The RBI statement said the Delhi High Court had recently ordered that the bank accounts of all the group firms be frozen. It also barred the directors of the CRB firms from disposing of any assets, whether the firms' or their own, it added.</p>
<p>The RBI listed each of the firms to which the orders apply.</p>
<p>The group's chairman, C.R. Bhansali, who is being questioned by Indian federal police, has said he wants to return all the money to his investors.</p>
