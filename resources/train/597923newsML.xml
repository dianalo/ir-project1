<title>MALAYSIA: KFC chief's exit amicable - official.</title>
<headline>KFC chief's exit amicable - official.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The resignation of KFC Holdings (Malaysia) Bhd's chief George Ting from his post was entirely amicable, a company official told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The speculation that there was a squabble between Ting and KFC is all rubbish. There was no squabble,&quot; said the official, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The announcement by the fast-food retailer earlier on Tuesday of Ting's departure as chief executive officer and managing director had caused speculation that there may have been disagreements at board level.</p>
<p>The official said Ting had left in order to pursue his personal business interests.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very friendly parting,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>The official added that Harris Beh, the company's current group executive director would be the natural successor to Ting, but said that he had not been made aware of any formal decision at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally he should be the one, as he is a major shareholder as well,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>Speculation that Ting's departure would jeopardise the franchise agreement between the company and U.S.-based PepsiCo Inc was also denied by the official.</p>
<p>&quot;That no longer applies. P.I. (PepsiCo Inc) have known for some time about the situation with Ting,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>KFC stock fell 30 cents to 10.30 ringgit at the Tuesday close on volume of 2.1 million shares traded. It earlier fell as much as 70 cents.</p>
