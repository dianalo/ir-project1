<title>AUSTRALIA: NSW pricing body releases new gas network draft.</title>
<headline>NSW pricing body releases new gas network draft.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>The New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal on Wednesday released its draft revised proposal for third party access to the state's gas pipeline distribution system.</p>
<p>The revised guidelines follow criticism of the initial proposal, released last September, to end the Australian Gas Light Co monopoly over the distribution system.</p>
<p>The proposals, which would allow third parties to buy gas and transport it through the AGL network, are part of plans to boost competition in the state's natural gas market. The initial proposal, broadly criticised by the industry, was &quot;clearly  </p>
<p>unacceptable to the market place&quot;, the tribunal said.</p>
<p>The revised guidelines offered larger reductions in average prices for gas transportation for contract market customers.</p>
<p>Average charges would fall from A$2.26 per gigajoule in 1995/96 to A$1.05 by 1999/2000, it said.</p>
<p>The pricing structure had also been changed to better reflect the distribution system used by customers, while technichal terms and conditions were less onerous.</p>
<p>&quot;The tribunal believes that the varied undertaking now meets the main requirements for commencing open access to AGL's natural gas distribution network,&quot; chairman Tom Parry said.  </p>
<p>AGL chairman Len Bleasel said in a statement he believed the industry should now move to open access on all gas distribution in Australia.</p>
<p>Bleasel said the main benefits from third party access would flow from competition among alternative sources of natural gas.</p>
<p>Two consortiums have plans to build pipelines linking Victoria and New South Wales, which would open competition between the Cooper Basin in South Australia and Bass Strait in Victoria. Comments on the revised draft are due by June 18.</p>
