<p>The Sudanese opposition said on Wednesday a Sudanese general and some of his men had joined the rebel forces in their fight against the Islamist government.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome Major General Ali Seddique, commander of the second infantry brigade ... with some of his forces yesterday (Tuesday) evening joining the National Democratic Alliance forces,&quot; the NDA said in a statement.</p>
<p>The opposition group said the general defected near the town of Khashm al-Girba, some 400 km (250 miles) east of Khartoum. It did not say how many soldiers defected with him and the report could not confirmed independently.</p>
<p>In January the Sudanese opposition forces launched an offensive along Sudan's eastern borders. They said they hoped this would provoke a popular uprising in Khartoum.</p>
<p>The fighting appears to have reached stalemate and the rebels continue to hold at least two Sudanese towns close to the Sudanese-Ethiopian border.</p>
