<p>Counting resumed on Sunday in Ireland's cliffhanger election with opposition Fianna Fail leader Bertie Ahern confident he could garner enough independent support to clinch a narrow majority in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Bertie Ahern has bound a fair few coalitions of different kinds together in his life,&quot; Ahern told Ireland's state RTE broadcasting network. &quot;It's there to be won.&quot;</p>
<p>But Prime Minister John Bruton was equally confident that the resumed count would deliver enough seats in the 166-seat parliament to return his centre-left &quot;Rainbow coalition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Rainbow will do it,&quot; said Bruton, fighting history to be the first Prime Minister to be re-elected in almost three decades.</p>
<p>With counting complete in 34 of the 41 constituencies, Fianna Fail had 72 seats and its Progressive Democrats ally a disappointing two after a mauling at the polls.</p>
<p>Bruton's Fine Gael had 46, its Labour ally 14 and Democratic Left junior partner three, for a total of 63.</p>
<p>But the balance of power seemed to lie with Independent parties including the Greens, which had two seats, small rural parties with six seats and the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, which will enter parliament for the first time in 75 years.</p>
<p>Independent parties, often based in the countryside with largely local agendas, have polled around 10 percent of Friday's vote, according to the latest count.</p>
<p>Both the main coalitions have made plain that they will not do any electoral deal with Sinn Fein until its Irish Republican Army (IRA) allies restore a truce in their 28-year war against British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>An inconclusive vote appeared the worst possible outcome for financial markets which had feared a hung parliament and the absence of a firm government to spell out economic policy for domestic and international investors.</p>
<p>&quot;What the market really does not want to see is a hung parliament. That is the greatest negative,&quot; Padhraic Garvey, economist at Riada Stockbrokers told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ahern's challenge was blunted by the poor showing of the Progressive Democrats of Mary Harney, which polled around 4.7 percent of votes and was set to lose many of its eight seats.</p>
<p>Bruton's coalition was torpedoed by the poor showing of Dick Spring's Labour party, which has held a balance of power in several governments over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>Voters spurned Labour, probably to punish the party for pulling out of a Fianna Fail-led coalition in 1992 when it joined Bruton in government.</p>
<p>&quot;We seem to be the fall guys,&quot; a rueful Spring commented as results came in showing that his party's support has ebbed from around 20 percent in 1992 to 10.5 at the weekend. &quot;It strikes me that neither side will have a majority.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring, and his chief lieutenant, Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn, ruled out any new coalition with Ahern's Fianna Fail, which may have to look to Independents and Greens for help.</p>
<p>But Quinn said every party would have to look at its options once final results are known on Sunday, although he and other spokesmen ruled out a pact with Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said: &quot;It is our fervent hope that it is a strong government, able to act decisively on rebuilding the peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;Sinn Fein will endeavour to work with it, to realise the hope and expectation which undoubtedly exists following three elections on this island, the change of government in Britain and the outcome of today's election.&quot;</p>
<p>On May 1 Adams and his chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, were elected to the British parliament with a record 16 percent of the vote against 11 percent five years earlier.</p>
<p>They refuse to take their seats because it would entail swearing allegiance to Britain's Queen.</p>
<p>But Caoimhghin O Caolain, Sinn Fein's successful candidate in Cavan Monaghan, will be taking his seat in the Irish parliament because of a change of strategy by the party in 1986 when it decided to end its boycott of the Dublin assembly.</p>
