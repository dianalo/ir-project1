<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - With the Reserve Bank meeting next week, economists were surveyed on their outlook for rates. They were asked two questions -- what is the chance of a rate cut being delivered in February? And if a cut has not been delviered by the end of February, what is the chance that there still would be another cut? The median forecasts were a 40 percent chance of a cut in February, rising to 50 percent if the cut has not been delivered by the end of February.</p>

<p>RETAIL TRADE - Tuesday's data, released on the day the RBA board meets, is expected to provide fuel to the interest rates bulls in the market. A small rise is expected in the month, in line with some retailers reporting poor Christmas sales. Some of those at the top end of forecasts said the reported weakness had been exaggerated, confined mainly to apparel. The quarterly data  </p>
<p>are expected to show real retail trade falling in the quarter, and therefore making a detraction from fourth quarter GDP. With the first component of the growth data a negative, some economists said it would get the market talking about the possibility of a negative GDP figure, even though this was unlikely at this stage.</p>
<p>WAGES - Average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) may not exactly be the most interesting sounding statistic, but it is seen by some as the key factor determining whether or not rates fall in February. A good number here, following on the  </p>
<p>favourable December quarter inflation data, would leave few obstacles in the way of a rate cut, economists said. The median forecast would have wages growing at a slower pace than in the previous two quarters and see the annual rate at its lowest level since August 1994 - all favourable for another rate cut.</p>
