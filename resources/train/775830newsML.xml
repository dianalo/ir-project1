<title>USA: Supply cuts in Colombia aid U.S. sour crude levels.</title>
<headline>Supply cuts in Colombia aid U.S. sour crude levels.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sour crude grade barrels in the U.S. Gulf spurted higher Monday, along with the outright price of crude, after Colombian Cano Limon field production was shut-in due to a new rebel bombing campaign.</p>
<p>September West Texas Intermediate/Cushing talked late at $20.70-80 a barrel, up some 50 cents from Friday.</p>
<p>For the second time in a month, Occidental Petroleum Corp declared force majeure on the 175,000 barrels per day (bpd) field after bombs damaged the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline.</p>
<p>Talk of a later-than-expected return of Tosco Corp's Bayway, New Jersey refinery to full operational status also propped the energy sector, notably aiding gasoline values.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the supply picture, Iraq moved one step closer to starting oil exports for the second round of the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; accord. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan approved Baghdad's aid distribution plan, made necessary for resuming liftings.</p>
<p>All that stands in the way of selling oil contracts is for Iraq to submit a pricing mechanism to U.N. oil overseers. Iraq envoy to the U.N., Nizar Hamdoon, told Reuters earlier Monday that Iraq would likely handover the pricing plan on Tuesday. Hamdoon said he expected no further delays in implementing the stalled accord.</p>
<p>Traders have pegged the end of this week, or early next week for first liftings out of the Ceyhan terminal. It was not known how much crude Iraq would, or could, export for the first period of the accord.</p>
<p>Baghdad has only around one month to sell up to $1 billion of oil under terms for the $2 billion accord.</p>
<p>Grade differentials reacted most strongly to the supply troubles in Colombia. Dealers said that fact, and the end of Venezuelan offerings for the near-term, bolstered West Texas Sour/Midland to discounts of only $1.32 under September WTI.</p>
<p>Friday saw WTS/Midland talk at a minus $1.40-45 clip.</p>
<p>Other barrels attracted scant attention when compared to the WTS move, with dealers spotting trades for Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James at 25 and 26 cents over benchmark, steady to a touch firmer than Friday.</p>
<p>WTI/Cushing Postings Plus moved between $1.99 and $2.01, with Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire done at -20 cents. Midland showed the slightest hint of moving out of well-established ranges, selling at a 27 and 28 cents discount to the marker.</p>
<p>Other news saw Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA announce it will raise throughput at its fire-stricken Curacao refinery by 10,000 bpd to 115,000 bpd over the next 17 days.</p>
<p>Full repairs at the 310,000 bpd facility will take a couple of months, following a serious fire last Thursday.</p>
