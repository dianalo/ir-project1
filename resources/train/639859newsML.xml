<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam's second son was formally charged on Thursday with taking kickbacks worth $3.6 million and evading taxes, prosecution officials said.</p>
<p>Kim Hyun-chul was arrested last month, dealing what many believe was a mortal blow to his father's credibility.</p>
<p>Under Korean law, Kim could be jailed for life for tax evasion. The maximum prison sentence for bribery is five years.</p>
<p>According to the charges, the younger Kim -- nicknamed the &quot;crown prince&quot; -- took his first kickback in March 1993, the month after his father came to office. It is alleged he accepted money to secure a cable television licence.</p>
<p>Since then, he received a total of 6.61 billion won ($7.4 million) from businessmen, 3.22 billion in the form of bribes, the charges allege.</p>
<p>He also was accused of pocketing kickbacks for help in securing a road-building contract, and on one occasion to influence a court judgment during the corruption trial of former president Roh Tae-woo.</p>
<p>The indictment said the younger Kim evaded taxes of 1.48 billion won on the gifts from businessmen, hiding the money in accounts using borrowed names.</p>
<p>One of the president's first acts on taking power was to abolish false-name accounts to flush into the open vast sums of black money squirrelled away during decades of corrupt rule by military-backed government.</p>
<p>That move led to the arrest and jailing of Roh, and another former president, Chun Doo Hwan.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the end of our investigation,&quot; senior prosecutor Shim Je-ryoon told reporters.</p>
<p>Shim said there were lingering suspicions over Kim Hyun-chul's links to a loans-for-kickbacks scandal involving Hanbo Steel, which collapsed in January. A court last week jailed the founder of Hanbo, key presidential aides, politicians and top bankers for their roles in the affair.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had previously said they could find no connection between Hanbo and the junior Kim. But Shim said: &quot;If new evidence emerges, we will pursue the investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Opposition parties allege the president's 1992 election campaign was partly financed by Hanbo, and that after massive overspending, unused election funds were laundered by Kim Hyun-chul.</p>
<p>Adding weight to those allegations, state prosecutors on Thursday also indicted a former top intelligence official, Kim Ki-sup. Shim said Kim Ki-sup managed seven billion won for his close friend, the president's son, and the money may be political funds.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot call it an election fund because we cannot confirm where the money came from and for whom it was intended,&quot; said Shim.</p>
<p>Kim Ki-sup was charged with receiving 150 million won in bribes to help obtain a cable television licence.</p>
<p>Shim said the prosecution found no hard evidence that Kim Ki-sup leaked top security information to Kim Hyun-chul.</p>
<p>President Kim's refusal to reveal details of his campaign spending has sparked public outrage and gave fresh impetus to a leftwing student organisation, which organised violent campus agitation starting last Friday.</p>
<p>One riot policeman died last Monday during rioting, and on Wednesday leftwing students admitted beating a man they suspected was a police informant. The man subsequently died.</p>
<p>Hundreds of riot police and students have also been injured in the trouble.</p>
