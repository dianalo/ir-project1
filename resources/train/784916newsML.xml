<p>The Singapore high sulphur fuel oil market fell on Thursday on strong selling pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was due for a correction after the recent spike and the physical sellers came out to sell the market down,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>A 20,000 tonne cargo for September 2-6 lifting traded at $102.00 per tonne, down $2.00 from Wednesday's lowest offered level. Another cargo for August 26-30 lifting was offered at $104 per tonne, traders said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the downward revision was expected but said the slide is expected to be tampered by the upcoming winter demand.</p>
<p>But prices for 380-cst were steady due to strong demand for bunkers and as a result the 180/380 cst spread narrowed to about $2.50 per tonne from $3.00.</p>
<p>A trader was bidding for a 380-cst cargo at $99.00 per tonne.</p>
<p>The lower physical price led to a late day sell off on the swaps market where August and September paper were last quoted at $102.50/$103.00 per tonne.  </p>
<p>Both months traded to an intra-day high of $103.50 per tonne, brokers said.</p>
<p>Traders said Taiwan's award for low pour and high pour fuel oil at a $4.00 per tonne spread compared to $9 in its previous tender was in line with the tight 180/380 cst spread seen in Singapore.</p>
<p>Taiwan bought by tender at least one 38,000-tonne cargo each of low and high pour 0.5 percent sulphur fuel oil at $128 and $124 per tonne, respectively.  </p>
<p>Industry sources said Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) might have bought two low pour cargoes, but a CPC official declined to confirm.</p>
<p>The cargoes are for delivery in the second half of September on a cost-and-freight basis to Keelung, Taichung or Shenao.</p>
<p>In its last tender, Taiwan bought two cargoes at $129 and $120 per tonne for September delivery.</p>
<p>The first low pour cargo was awarded at $129 for September 1-10 delivery and the high pour cargo at $120 for September 21-30 delivery.  </p>
