<p>Bombay stocks powered to a strong close on Wednesday, extending the market's two-day old winning streak with shares of multinational companies topping the day's action, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some kind of bullishness is partly due to expectations by the investing community that the revised carry-forward report will be accepted by the Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India (SEBI),&quot; Alok Sethi, director at Natwest Markets, told Reuters. A SEBI-appointed panel on Tuesday submitted recommendations for an easier carry-forward trading system.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, the markets had dipped reasonably and (last week) and so we are kind of recovering,&quot; Natwest's Sethi said.</p>
<p>Political worries forced the Bombay index to post its biggest week-to-week fall, down five percent last week. The Bombay index has since recouped three percent of the losses.  </p>
<p>Hectic bidding was noticed in fast-moving consumer goods stocks (FMCG) by foreign funds and local funds, traders said.</p>
<p>They said newspaper reports that the U.S.'s Alliance Capital planned to float a $60-million offshore fund targeting Indian FMCG stocks led to renewed action in these shares.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking to people. If there is interest in the fund, we might take a decision next month,&quot; an official at Alliance Capital told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shares of Colgate rose 12.0 rupees to 317.25, Nestle gained 6.75 rupees at 293.50, Hindustan Lever added 26.20 at 1,362.0 and Ponds jumped 71.75 to 1,805.0.</p>
