<p>Sales at retail stores posted a surprisingly strong rise in September, the Commerce Department said on Friday, largely because of a surge in business for new-car dealers.</p>
<p>Total retail sales increased last month by 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $205.7 billion after a steeply revised 0.2 percent decline in August sales.</p>
<p>But excluding automobile business, September retail sales were up a more modest 0.4 percent. That followed a revised 0.5 percent August drop that was the biggest decline since a 0.6 percent fall in October last year.  </p>
<p>(May be bylined Glenn Somerville)</p>
<p>The overall 0.7 percent increase in September retail sales was well above Wall Street economists' forecasts for an 0.2 percent gain.</p>
<p>During September dealer sales of new cars rose 1.7 percent to $50.8 billion after a revised 0.5 percent August increase that previously was reported as only a 0.1 percent rise.</p>
<p>Analysts said beforehand that the department's survey of auto dealers had undercounted sales in August and likely would require a large revision. New cars account for about one-fifth of total retail sales, so swings in demand or problems in counting sales strongly affect the overall monthly figures.</p>
<p>Sales by general merchandise stores rose 0.3 percent to $26 billion after a 0.8 percent rise in August. At apparel stores, sales of clothing fell 0.1 percent after falling 0.5 percent in August.</p>
<p>Overall sales of durable goods, which includes cars and other long-lasting items, rose 0.9 percent in September after a 0.1 percent decline in August. Sales of non-durables like food and clothing increased 0.6 percent last month after falling 0.3 percent in August.</p>
<p>August sales previously were reported rising 0.2 percent but that was sharply revised to a show a 0.2 percent decline.</p>
<p>Sales of building materials increased 0.1 percent last month to $11.1 billion after dropping 2.2 percent in August.</p>
<p>Sales by food stores rose 1.2 percent to $35.6 billion last month following a 0.5 percent August drop.</p>
<p>Gasoline service station sales increased 0.6 percent to $13 billion after dropping 0.8 percent in August.</p>
