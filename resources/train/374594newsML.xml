<p>Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings Inc's new chief executive officer Frank O'Connell said Thursday the greeting card firm has $98 million in cash and is ready to romance acquisition targets -- the first time in years the beleaguered company has been able to do so.</p>
<p>As reported, Gibson sent a Valentine to shareholders, posting fourth quarter earnings of $0.39 a share.  That beat First Call's $0.29 consensus analysts' estimate and topped the year-ago $0.29 a share (which excludes a unit sold in 1995).  </p>
<p>&quot;I think first what we're looking for is probably a decent-sized acquisition that really gives us some critical mass and acceleration on a path (beyond greeting cards only),&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Cincinnati-based Gibson suffered 1994 derivatives losses, lost several key customers and sold an unprofitable unit.  It fired its previous top executive a year ago.</p>
<p>With less than 10 percent of the U.S. greeting card market, it is a distant third to Hallmark Cards Inc, estimated to have more than 40 percent, and American Greetings Corp, with about one-third.  </p>
<p>O'Connell declined to specify acquisition targets but said they might, like Gibson's candle business, be in areas that &quot;create a romantic environment&quot; and complement greeting cards.</p>
<p>Or they might be firms that can provide entree to retail outlets such as bookstores, music stores and video stores.</p>
<p>Gibson's licensed lines such as &quot;Space Jams&quot; and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; are a great video tie-in, he said, adding such outlets would provide alternatives to the highly competitive mass merchandiser/supermarket/drug store arena.  </p>
<p>O'Connell, who arrived at Gibson in August, said he plans to reach new target audiences including teens and children with &quot;alternative&quot; greeting cards and puzzles and toys such as model kits of Batman's car, the Batmobile.</p>
<p>O'Connell's strategy is for &quot;an entertainment company in the relationship business,&quot; he said.  He sees greeting cards as a medium to enhance relationships and to connect people beyond traditional greeting cards' reach -- for example, grandparents to grandchildren whose parents divorce, he said.  </p>
<p>He plans to also grow the greeting card business with new lines such as recently launched &quot;Ripple Effects&quot; textured cards with what he termed &quot;bold graphics and crisp verse.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Connell formerly headed trading card manufacturer SkyBox International, now part of Marvel Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>Analyst Eric Bosshard, with Midwest Research/Maxus Group, said that since Gibson spurned a $290 million bid from rival American Greetings last year due to antitrust concerns, he sees &quot;a sense of urgency to generate some earnings growth.&quot;</p>
<p>New products, new licensing agreements and acquisitions will key top-line revenue growth, Bosshard said, adding he expects &quot;a couple&quot; of acquisitions this year.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter benefitted from a currency gain, Bosshard said, but earnings were still ahead of his expectations and reflected progress on expenses.</p>
<p>Gibson also topped analysts' expectations for the year, reporting $1.34 a share versus First Call's consensus $1.22 and 1995's $1.00.  Sales for the year were $390.2 million versus 1995's $388.9 million.</p>
<p>O'Connell declined to forecast earnings.</p>
<p>The stock rose 1-1/16 to 20-9/16 on Nasdaq.</p>
