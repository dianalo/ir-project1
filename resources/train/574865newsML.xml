<p>French President Jacques Chirac, enmeshed in a snap parliamentary election campaign, took a trip to the Cannes film festival on Sunday for a high-profile luncheon surrounded by glamorous cinema stars.</p>
<p>French presidents generally try to remain above politics during campaigns, but that did not prevent Chirac from presiding over a glittery luncheon at the Cannes Palais des Festivals, where he sat between actresses Isabelle Adjani of France and Gong Li of China.</p>
<p>Chirac, the first sitting president to visit Cannes during the annual film festival, was soon seen on television newscasts chatting and laughing with the two stars.</p>
<p>Both women are on the Cannes jury which hands out the festival awards including the coveted Golden Palm, and Adjani is its president.</p>
<p>Also attending the luncheon were a number of past Cannes Golden Palm winners including Michelangelo Antonioni, Francis Ford Coppola and Shohei Immamura.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to be here to pay my respects to the great personalities of the seventh art, but I am especially pleased to pay homage to the French cinema, which is vibrant, growing and successful,&quot; Chirac said in brief remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;Our film industry is an important asset to our culture, our influence and our economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The festival is feting its 50th birthday this year, with a star-studded gala on Sunday night. But Chirac returned to Paris after just three hours in the Riviera resort town, despite widespread rumours he would change his plans and stay.</p>
<p>Chirac stunned the French political world last month by dissolving parliament nine months ahead of schedule and setting a snap parliamentary election for May 25-June 1 though his centre-right government enjoyed an overwhelming majority in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>He said he wanted a renewed assembly with a five-year mandate for reform.</p>
<p>But his political gamble is up in the air as polls portray a tight contest, with the left within striking distance of ousting the centre-right from power.</p>
<p>French presidents typically stay off the campaign trail. But Cannes was his second high-profile weekend public appearance.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, he attended the French soccer cup final at Paris' Parc des Princes stadium.</p>
