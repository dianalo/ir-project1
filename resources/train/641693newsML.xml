<p>The depreciating Taiwan dollar again tested longstanding support on Thursday, but last-minute U.S. dollar sales -- likely orchestrated by the central bank -- pulled it back to a slightly higher close, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit dived to as low as T$27.912 on active buying of the U.S. dollar by many interests, but the rate closed at its intraday high of T$27.890, virtually unchanged from Wednesday's T$27.891 finish.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was an active US$276 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;It really looks like the central bank's invisible hand is actively defending the Taiwan dollar, but it's difficult to prove,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank has become very good at intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank defended the dollar at T$27.5 for years, but said in mid-1996 it was abandoning the policy, hinting a depreciation was welcome in the interest of stronger exports.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar has been on a long, slow decline since mid-January and recently has repeatedly flirted with T$27.9, prompting dealers to predict it would break support at $T28 in the second half -- but not until the central bank is ready.  </p>
<p>A T$27.892 close would be the lowest since January 7, 1989.</p>
<p>Quarter-end commercial demand for the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar's recent general strength overseas were the main reasons for persistent buying of the greenbank, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;With U.S. dollar demand continuing to be strong, the market will not give up testing the T$27.90 level on Friday,&quot; the dealer said. &quot;But the central bank's attitude pretty much sets the rate.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank appeared to be determined not to let the local unit fall below the T$27.90 support level at close for the time being, dealers said.  </p>
<p>A range of T$27.89-92 was seen for Friday.</p>
