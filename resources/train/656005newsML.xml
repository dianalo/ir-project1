<p>The Tallinn stock exchange on Thursday saw heavy trade again and prices maintained their upward momentum, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said that some players were expecting bank profit forecasts for 1997 to be revised higher amid talk of takeovers and mergers in the bank sector.</p>
<p>The Talse index rose 1.47 percent to 261.06 on total trade of 81.5 million kroons versus 88 million kroons on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said market players seemed to believe that prices are set to rise further.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market is able to retain such a high turnover, then the trend (to rise) will continue,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors buying in large blocks were behind the demand but also dealers themselves were taking positions.</p>
<p>Hansapank was most active on 24.8 million kroons and rose 2.05 kroons to 138.30 kroons. Hoiupank added 3.05 kroons to 136.5 kroons on turnover of 22.6 million kroons.</p>
<p>The market has been energised by talk of takeovers in the banking sector. Hoiupank has announced it was considering a merger with any local bank and said Forekspank was the most interesting.</p>
<p>After positive May results, banks are also expected to upgrade their full-year 1997 profit forecasts.</p>
<p>Trade on the free market was 12.2 million kroons on Thursday with Norma the most active at 4.95 million kroons, adding 1.5 kroons to 71 kroons.</p>
