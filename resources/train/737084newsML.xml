<p>Stanley Leisure Plc plans further additions to its 566-strong betting shop chain and could end up owning some of the William Hill units, chief executive Mike Kershaw said on Thursday.</p>
<p>William Hill, Britain's second largest chain with over 1,500 shops, is set to be sold by debt-laden owners Brent Walker Group Plc. Bass Plc is tipped as the likely purchaser but may have to sell off some shops to avoid monopoly concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some fall-out from any William Hill deal,&quot; said Kershaw, who added that Stanley would continue to pick up shops from independent operators who decide to sell up.  </p>
<p>A strong performance from its racing division helped Stanley increase its year pre-tax profits to 19.4 million stg from 14.8 million.</p>
<p>Racing division profits before financing costs leapt almost 80 percent to 13 million stg, boosted by a 1.5 million contribution from acquisitions.</p>
<p>Stanley had a net increase of 101 shops last year following its acquisition of the Gus Carter chain in north-east England and sites in the south.</p>
<p>The introduction of fruit machines to shops in June last year has proved popular. Kershaw said he would like to see an increase in the size of stake and jackpot from their current levels of 25p and 10 stg respectively.</p>
<p>Kershaw repeated the industry's demand for the law to be changed to allow betting on the UK's national lottery.</p>
<p>Stanley had pre-tax profit of almost 11 million stg from its 21-unit casino division, up by 4.6 percent.</p>
<p>The company is hoping to reap the benefits of deregulation introduced in April which extended drinking hours in casinos, permitted the use of debit cards and cut the membership waiting period.</p>
<p>Further deregulation including permits for casinos in 20 new areas is in the pipeline. Kershaw said Stanley would probably look to add a further three casinos to its portfolio when the rules are relaxed.</p>
