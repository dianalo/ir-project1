<headline>Ireland's Bruton optimistic for IRA ceasefire.</headline>

<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said on Tuesday that he was hopeful that the Irish Republican Army would restore the 17-month ceasefire that it ended in February with a bomb blast in London.</p>
<p>Speaking to a correspondent in Washington, Bruton said: &quot;The conditions may exists in which a ceasefire might be called.&quot;</p>
<p>The Irish leader, who is on a trip to Washington, made it clear that he had no specific information but he said that without a ceasefire there would be a defensiveness and an unwillingness to compromise.</p>
<p>He told the BBC that he believed there should have been a ceasefire before the summer but the time had come when the IRA leadership might be ready to make a decision to restore the ceasefire.</p>
<p>The BBC correspondent said Bruton was speaking about his feelings and not because he had received any specific information. He was working on the basis of his political judgement, he added.</p>
<p>His comments came as Northern Ireland peace talks resumed in Belfast after a summer break. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has been barred from the all-party talks because the IRA has refused to renew the truce in its 25-year war against British rule in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Bruton said bilateral talks in Northern Ireland between the the Ulster Unionists, the chief voice of majority pro-British Protestants, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the main moderate nationalist party of the Catholic minority who want a United Ireland through peaceful means, could create the conditions for a new ceasefire.</p>
<p>Up until now the IRA has shown no signs of agreeing to a new ceasefire. Since it broke the truce with a huge bomb in London's Docklands financial district in which two people were killed it has issued a series of statements accusing Britain of raising last-minute preconditions to Sinn Fein participation in the talks, sponsored by Britain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams has said he wants to see the cessation restored but the IRA leadership has been reluctant to once again lay down its arms.</p>
