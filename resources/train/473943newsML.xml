<p>South African President Nelson Mandela arrived in New Delhi on Thursday on a three-day official visit to India, officials said.</p>
<p>Mandela, on his second official visit to India, was scheduled to attend a ceremonial reception at the presidential palace and attend an official banquet hosted in his honour by President Shankar Dayal Sharma later on Thursday.</p>
<p>South African diplomats said Mandela was due to discuss the future of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation with Indian officials.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers of Non-Aligned Movement nations are scheduled to meet in New Delhi on April 7 and 8.</p>
<p>Mandela, accompanied by South African Transport Minister Mac Maharaj, was also scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and vice-president Kocheril Narayanan on Thursday.</p>
<p>Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who visited India last December, had called for a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; between the two nations to redefine the agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement, which groups 112 developing countries who seek non-alignment to any superpower.</p>
<p>South African diplomats said Mandela and Maharaj would discuss the possibility of making South Africa a transshipment point for trade between India and South America.</p>
<p>They said Mandela would also appeal to India to support Cape Town's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2004.</p>
<p>Mandela first visited India in 1990 to receive the Bharat Ratna award, the country's highest civilian honour. His first official visit was in 1995.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade between the two nations rose to $600 million in 1996 from $80 million in 1993, when they restored diplomatic ties. It is poised to cross $1.0 billion in 1997, according to Indian foreign ministry statistics.</p>
<p>India and South Africa are co-founders of the 14-member Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation which aims at forming a regional free trade bloc.</p>
<p>India was the first country to sever trade relations with Pretoria in 1946 in protest against the apartheid polices of racial segregation, which Mandela opposed as leader of his currently ruling African National Congress (ANC).</p>
