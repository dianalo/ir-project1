<p>Morgan Stanley said it was raising its forecast for Argentine economic growth this year to 4.5 percent from 4.0 percent, and to 4.5 percent from 2.9 percent for 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel more positive about the growth fundamentals in the country for both 1997 and 1998 and beyond,&quot; said the investment bank in an equity research briefing note.  </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley acknowledged that its forecasts contrast with most analysts' predictions of 5-6 percent growth this year, but said its feeling was that the likelihood of U.S. rate rises was &quot;a major risk to a higher growth scenario.&quot;</p>
<p>It expects relatively strong consumer spending growth in the second half of 1996 to carry over into 1997, but that the &quot;torrid&quot; growth of late last year would cool down.</p>
<p>&quot;For 1998, we believe that the 4.5 percent pace is sustainable throughout the year, provided the Brazilian currency remains in our forecast range and barring new political surprises in Argentina bearing on the October elections (in Congress),&quot; the bank said.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also underlined its concerns about the lack of job creation and lending by Argentine banks and about the need for Argentina's budget deficit to remain at or below 2.0 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
