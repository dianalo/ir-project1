<p>New England at first got a bigger kick from free trade agreements the United States signed with its neighbors than the rest of the nation but growth has slowed, a Federal Reserve official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jane Sneddon Little, assistant vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who noted that she was expressing her personal views, pointed to figures from the Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research that showed the value of New England's exports to Canada rose to 30 percent in 1996 from 21 percent in 1987, when compared with shipments sent to other destinations.</p>
<p>During that period, the same gauge showed the total value of U.S. exports to Canada fell to 21 percent from 22 percent, Little said, in an address to the Annual Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers.</p>
<p>The United States and Canada put a free trade pact in place in 1989, followed by one with Mexico in 1994, according to the Fed official.</p>
<p>New England exports found a better market in Canada. The value of shipments to Mexico only grew to three percent from two percent from 1987 to 1996, she noted, citing the natural advantage the New England states gained from its proximity to the Canadian border as well as its attractive product mix.</p>
<p>However, Little pointed out that New England no longer was getting the same benefit from the traditional manufacturing sector, which has downsized, or from top-notch research institutions that now have more competition.</p>
<p>Further, the region's trade with its northern neighbor initially was boosted by the fairly high number of companies that have affiliates across the border. As these entities were reorganized, some of the gains they made slowed. And a decline in the semiconducter sector last year also hurt New England's region's exports, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that much of New England's period of good financial performance occured in the early years,&quot; she said, but later added that she expected trade to continue rising, though perhaps a bit more slowly.</p>
<p>Sore spots remained between the two countries, with questions raised about ways to smooth trade disputes and one Canada official noting pointedly that the U.S. Jones Act protects domestic shipping from competition.</p>
<p>Timothy O'Neill, exceutive vice president and chief economist of the Bank of Montreal, pointed out that while Canada has raised more trade disputes, the dollar value of the U.S. complaints has been bigger.</p>
<p>He proposed that one way to reform the complaint process might be to limit it to major battles. &quot;The most useful one (change) I think might be just to raise the bar on what disputes can be brought forward, what amount...for example, or what share of importing is going to be allowable, what level of subsidy will trigger a dispute.&quot;</p>
<p>The economist recommended against setting up special trade pacts for different industries, like natural resources, as has been proposed, saying more broad-based agreements were preferable.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with that is you end up, in effect, moving to a more sector-managed trade environment and I don't think in the end that that will be of benefit to participating countries.&quot;</p>
