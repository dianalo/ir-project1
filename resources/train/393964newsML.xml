<headline>Treasury's Rubin -- strong dollar in U.S. interest.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, in a statement accompanying a semi-annual report on foreign exchange, repeated on Friday that a strong dollar was in the U.S. interest and it has been strong for some time now.</p>
<p>The report covering the six months through last Oct 31, said that no major trading partners were manipulating exchange rates for advantage and termed that time a period of &quot;welcome stability&quot; in currency markets.</p>
<p>&quot;A strong dollar is in the United States' interest. We have had a strong dollar for some time now,&quot; Rubin said in a statement released with the report.  </p>
<p>The Treasury report to Congress is required by law.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on its review, Treasury has determined that none of our major trading partners has manipulated its exchange rate...during the period examined,&quot; Treasury said.</p>
<p>But it made clear that U.S. authorities will continue to monitor the exchange rate policies of its trading partners closely and will encourage them to drop controls over capital movements and provide greater exchange rate flexibility.</p>
<p>At the same time, Treasury said major industrial nations, in general, do not try to target specific exchange rate levels or to artifically sustain an undervalued currency.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, just as we believe that it would be inappropriate for the United States to manipulate exchange levels to gain competitive advantage, we believe such an approach to be equally inappropriate for other major industrialized countries,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report said that China has made &quot;significant progress&quot; in liberalizing its foreign exchange system and &quot;as of the end of the period covered by this report, was close to achieving full current account convertibility.&quot;</p>
<p>But it said China at the same time was increasing control over some capital account transactions.  </p>
<p>The Treasury report suggested China permit more exchange rate flexibility, which it said would permit China's currency, the yuan, to rise in value and reduce its trade surplus with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Treasury said a key factor in the growing U.S. trade gap with China was the shift in trade and investment from other Asian countries like Taiwan and Singapore as manufacturing has moved to China in search of lower wages.</p>
<p>The report said the United States has little to fear from the scheduled Jan 1, 1999, introduction of European economic and monetary union, known as EMU.  </p>
<p>&quot;While EMU is a major event with important consequences for Europe, the economic implications of a successful EMU for the U.S. are likely to be limited,&quot; Treasury said.</p>
<p>But it said the United States would carefully monitor the transition to ensure its competitive position was not adversely affected through discriminatory access to payments systems or financial markets.</p>
<p>The report painted a generally favorable picture for the global economy, forecasting a 2.2 percent expansion in national goods and services output for major industrial countries during 1997.</p>
<p>It added that consumer price inflation among industrial nations was likely to remain low at around 2.3 percent this year.</p>
