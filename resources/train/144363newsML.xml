<title>UK: London gold moves sideways, platinum crumbles.</title>
<headline>London gold moves sideways, platinum crumbles.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold and silver moved uneasily in tight price bands on Friday, searching for market direction after coming off a steady price surge earlier this week.</p>
<p>But platinum tumbled to recent lows on New York-led technical selling, dropping briefly below the price of gold for the first time in nearly three years.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $382.55 an ounce, up slightly from the morning's fix of $382.20 but nowhere near the week's highs around $384 an ounce. Although gold was finding some support around $382 an ounce, it appeared to lack the momentum to carry it higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold's bursts of strength is running out of steam, as is that of platinum,&quot; technical analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said in a commentary.</p>
<p>The market registered no reaction to a rebound in U.S. durable goods orders in September after a sharp drop in August. It also sparked minimal response in U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>But the South African rand was at an all-time low after plunging below 4.60 to the dollar on Friday, which was seen possibly encouraging selling by gold producers.</p>
<p>Gold, with the rest of the precious metals in tow, had notched up about $4.00 at the start of the week in an apparent recovery from a downtrend since early September.</p>
<p>But a tumble in silver prices on Thursday afternoon dragged gold and the other precious metals lower.</p>
<p>Silver was indicated unchanged from Thursday's London close at $4.90/$4.92 an ounce.</p>
<p>Platinum, which had drifted lower with gold on Thursday and slumped further overnight, took another hit shortly after its afternoon fixing of $384.25 an ounce.</p>
<p>Prices crumbled to recent lows near $380 an ounce, then quickly rebounded slightly higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The price was pushed down and some stops on NYMEX (New York's futures market) were hit. This is a technical move, because there's a dearth of fundamental news,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting some support technically and because it's flat with gold,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Platinum was indicated at $382.50/$383.50 an ounce, down $3.10 an ounce from Thursday's London close, after hitting a high of $388.50 an ounce earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Its sister metal palladium was slightly easier at $116.25/$117.25, down $1.00 from Thursday's close.</p>
