<text>
<p>Vietnam's President Anh was being treated in a Hanoi hospital on Sunday for blood pressure problems, but there were mixed reports about the severity of his condition.</p>
<p>Medical staff at Hanoi's prestigious 108 Army hospital said the 75-year-old president was being treated there but declined to discuss details of the case.  </p>
<p>One government official, who declined to be named, said Anh, 75, was unconscious and suffering haemorrhaging around the brain. He said doctors were having difficulties dealing with his condition.</p>
<p>But others played down the reports. A hospital staff member said Anh had been ill during the past week but was recovering and might be discharged later on Sunday.</p>
<p>General Anh is one of three top leaders in Vietnam and was appointed president in September 1992.</p>
<p>The other members of the collective triumvirate are Party chief Do Muoi, 79, and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 73.</p>
