<p>Emergency repair workers fought overnight to repair dykes to prevent the River Oder along Germany's border with Poland breaking its banks and flooding thousands of thousands, German officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Matthias Platzeck, environment minister in the eastern German state of Brandenburg, said plans were being made for possible evacuation of the region, after floods sweeping central Europe claimed scores of lives in neighbouring Poland.</p>
<p>Speaking on local Berlin radio, Platzeck said around 350 leaks had to be monitored in dykes around the river, where water levels are at record high levels.</p>
<p>About 20,000 people live in Germany's Oderbruch area on the Polish border -- a low-lying area that would face certain flooding if the river broke its banks. But officials fear other areas could be affected by possible flooding.</p>
<p>Brandenburg interior minister Alwin Ziel said he expected the floods, which swept through central Europe claiming dozens of lives last week, to result in high water levels in the east German region for the next two weeks at least.</p>
<p>&quot;The important question is whether the dykes can stand up...I have grave concerns about this and that's why we have to take this so seriously,&quot; said Ziel, also speaking on radio.</p>
<p>The warning came as the nearby state of Lower Saxony said it was making an extra 800,000 sandbags available to Brandenburg to support the banks of the Oder, whose level has in some places swollen to to nearly three metres above normal.</p>
