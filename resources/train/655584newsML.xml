<p>Chile will make a formal complaint to Bolivia after sports organisers there displayed an altered version of the Chilean flag at a Latin American soccer tournament, Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said Thursday.</p>
<p>Calling the incident a case of &quot;bad manners,&quot; Insulza said Chile will complain to Bolivian authorities over Chile's flag being displayed without the large white star in its upper left-hand corner at the Copa America soccer tournament.</p>
<p>Chile's national soccer team refused to march behind the starless flag as it was paraded around a Bolivian stadium at the tournament's opening ceremonies.</p>
<p>&quot;This sort of thing makes the Bolivian people look bad. It's organising a sports competition being shown all over, and everyone sees these demonstrations of bad manners,&quot; Insulza told reporters.</p>
<p>Insulza said he would ask the Chilean consul for details on the incident and make a complaint &quot;to express our irritation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They need to be told that this sort of thing is just not done, and that it's not good for their image,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Insulza did not say whether he thought the Bolivians deliberately altered the Chilean flag or if it was a careless omission. But Chile's national soccer coach said he considered the incident a deliberate show of disrespect.</p>
<p>Bolivians have bitterly resented their neighbours to the south since the War of the Pacific in the 1880s, in which Bolivia lost much of its territory and its outlet to the Pacific Ocean to Chile.</p>
<p>Anti-Chilean feeling in Bolivia occasionally erupts into attacks on Chilean investments, and the two countries do not have full diplomatic relations.</p>
