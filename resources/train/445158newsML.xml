<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul stocks close lower on weak fundamentals.</title>

<p>Seoul stocks closed Saturday's half-day session lower after the early technical rebound was outpaced by selling on weak fundamentals, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite index closed at 641.83, down 0.25 of a point. It fluctuated from 638.39 to 647.14 during the session.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall mood continued to be bleak as investors saw no change in the fundamentals, such as high interest rates,&quot; said Koh Kyung-bae of Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Friday's finance ministry announcement that it had scrapped ceilings on foreign borrowings by banks and companies had little impact on trading.  </p>
<p>Declining stocks led advancers by 440 to 326.</p>
<p>Midopa Department Store, Dainong and Shindongbang -- which have been at the centre of a hostile takeover talk -- all fell to daily limits as investors saw the talk had died as a market-moving factor.</p>
<p>The Sungwon Group said on Friday it would sell its holding of Midopa shares to Dainong, Midopa's largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Midopa fell by 2,000 won to 23,400, Dainong by 500 won to 5,850 and Shindongbang by 2,500 won to 28,900.</p>
