<headline>EMU debate on Spain, Italy worries markets -banker.</headline>
<dateline>DAVOS, Switzerland 1997-02-03</dateline>

<p>A senior Dresdner Bank AG executive said on Monday he was very concerned that financial markets were unsettled by the debate about whether Italy and Spain will be among the first participants of European Economic and Monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;This (discussion) is something which has to be ended very soon. Otherwise, the markets will be in very high uncertainty through 1997, which could lead to difficulties,&quot; management board member Ernst-Moritz Lipp told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Lipp said &quot;a clear word soon&quot; that only a small block of countries was entering EMU would give financial markets certainty.</p>
<p>Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Lipp said he did not think Italy and Spain would be able to join monetary union at the scheduled start date on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>His comments follow remarks over the weekend by other German bankers who held out the prospect of turmoil on financial markets if countries like Italy joined from the start.</p>
<p>The bankers said market confidence in euro stability could only be won if EMU was at first limited to countries with hard currencies.</p>
<p>Lipp said &quot;the most probable scenario is that it will be Germany, France and smaller countries like the Benelux and Austria. But I am very worried about the actual discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;There are convergence trades. There is speculation on Spain and Italy coming into EMU, but it is a highly politicised assumption because Spain may fulfill the criteria and Italy not and then, the discussion would be on whether it is appropriate to have Spain in and Italy not.&quot;</p>
