<title>UK: Prudential sells M&amp;G Re to Swiss Re.</title>
<headline>Prudential sells M&amp;G Re to Swiss Re.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prudential Corp said on Tuesday it had agreed to sell its M&amp;G reinsurance operation to Swiss Re, realising 1.75 billion stg.</p>
<p>Prudential will receive proceeds of 1.704 billion stg in cash, and also realises a special dividend of 50 million stg.  </p>
<p>The sale of M&amp;G, resulting from a strategic review of Prudential, was agreed on Monday and should be completed by the end of the year. It is subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Prudential had said in June that it intended to float part of M&amp;G on the stock market later this year. But a trade sale had not been ruled out.</p>
<p>&quot;Since this (June) announcement, we have received a number of approaches from potential trade purchasers,&quot; said Prudential group chief executive Peter Davis in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have decided that a sale of the whole company at the agreed price, which we believe substantially exceeds what we could have achieved through a public offering, is clearly in the best interests of our sharehlders,&quot; said Davis.</p>
<p>He said the deal would allow Prudential to concentrate its resources on developing its retail financial services business in the UK, United States and Asia.</p>
<p>The group has for some time been looking to buy a building society or life assurer in Britain.</p>
<p>M&amp;G last year had gross written premiums of 1.3 billion stg and net assets at the end of 1995 of 1.1 billion stg.  </p>
<p>Pre-tax profits were 326 million stg and post-tax operating profit was 135 million stg.</p>
<p>M&amp;G is predominantly focused on life and health reinsurance and has a worldwide network of 27 offices.</p>
<p>Swiss Re had been beaten to the purchase of U.S. property and casualty reinsurer American Re, which was bought by Munich Re for $3.3 billion earlier this month.</p>
