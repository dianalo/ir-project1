<p>Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said in remarks published on Sunday that defence and training pacts with Israel remained intact despite the rise of an Islamist-led government in Ankara.</p>
<p>&quot;I am making clear: the Turkish-Israeli military cooperation, as with cooperation in all other areas, will continue in the future without interruption,&quot; he told the Israeli daily Haaretz in an interview in the Turkish capital.</p>
<p>Israel and Turkey signed an agreement in February allowing Israeli air force jets to train in Turkish air space.</p>
<p>The accord drew strong protests at the time from Islamists, whose leader Necmettin Erbakan has toned down his criticism since becoming prime minister 2-1/2 months ago. A month ago the two countries signed a defence industry cooperation deal.</p>
<p>Demirel said it was a mistake to call the present Turkish government &quot;Islamist&quot; since it was a coalition created in accordance with the law by two political parties represented in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover the principles of foreign policy of Turkey stay put,&quot; he said in the weekend interview.</p>
<p>Demirel said it was no secret that neighbouring countries such as Iran and Syria were worried. But he emphasised that neither accord was directed against a third country.</p>
<p>He reiterated Ankara's plans to set up a temporary security zone in northern Iraq to prevent infiltration by separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) using bases there to launch attacks for self-rule in southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>Turkey had said the recent sweep of northern Iraq by another Baghdad-backed Kurdish faction, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), increased the need for a cordon.</p>
<p>&quot;Because the recent events have made the authority vacuum worse in northern Iraq, Turkey stands by the need to take a series of steps in order to maintain its security and protect innocent citizens.</p>
<p>&quot;In this framework we have decided to declare the zone parallel to our border at a depth of 5-15 kms (three to nine miles) a 'temporary danger zone',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said there would be no permanent military presence but that intelligence and monitoring measures would be used.</p>
<p>Demirel also assailed what he called &quot;Syria's support for the Kurdish terror of the PKK against Turkey.&quot;</p>
<p>He said: &quot;Syria is interested in undermining the stability of and weakening Turkey. Damascus supports all the organisations whose purpose is to change the government in Turkey.&quot;</p>
