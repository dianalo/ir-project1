<p>Negotiators from Zaire's warring sides met face-to-face on Saturday morning for the first time at the start of peace talks to try to reach a solution to the six-month civil war in the vast Central African country.</p>
<p>The talks were given added urgency late on Friday by an appeal from the United Nations Security Council to both sides to let aid agencies help refugees dying of malnutrition and diseases return home.</p>
<p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki welcomed the representatives of President Mobutu Sese Seko's government and rebels of Laurent Kabila in the cabinet room of South Africa's government headquarters.</p>
<p>Mbeki said the outcome of the talks could have a profound impact not only on Zaire but on the continent as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to say that the delegations have the power to take decisions about the matters they are discussing and hopefully that will allow us to move the process forward rapidly.&quot;</p>
<p>Their task was outlined this week by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who said he hoped the Zairean government and the rebels would set a date for both a ceasefire and proper negotiations during their talks in South Africa.</p>
<p>Before shaking hands with Mobutu's envoys, the head of Kabila's delegation, Bizima Karaha, told reporters at the talks: &quot;We asked for these negotiations more than five months ago.&quot;</p>
<p>As he welcomed Mobutu's representatives, who stared ahead stonily, he said: &quot;It is a good signal that they are here.&quot;</p>
<p>Karaha had threatened on Friday to return to Zaire if the government delegation did not demonstrate it was prepared to talk in earnest.</p>
<p>He said Zaire, like the rest of Africa, wanted to be free of &quot;misery, diseases and dictatorship&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why we are here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Karaha said he hoped the government delegation, having made it to the talks, would continue to have the courage to negotiate, especially since the people of Zaire wanted democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>Despite diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire, the rebels continued their advances in the mining regions of central Zaire.</p>
<p>Rebel forces, which have seized control of about a quarter of the country in just six months, entered Zaire's diamond capital of Mbuji-Mayi early on Saturday, mining sources in the town said.</p>
<p>Rebels have also been slowly encircling Lubumbashi, Zaire's copper-mining hub, which they say is their next target.</p>
<p>The talks began with Kabila's representatives seated to the left of Mbeki and Zaire's delegation to his right, alongside U.N. envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.</p>
<p>Richard Wenu, a spokesman for Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL), told Reuters the negotiations would take place in English. Officials said it was not clear how long the talks would take.</p>
<p>Talks were delayed by over an hour because of the late arrival of Zairean Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda, one of Mobutu's representatives, who arrived on Saturday morning.</p>
