<p>Following are comments from economists to German September unemployment data that were released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The number of people out of work in all of Germany rose 39,000 to 3.991 million on a seasonally-adjusted basis in September. The unemployment rate, based on unadjusted data, eased slightly to 10.1 percent from 10.2 percent in August.</p>
<p>Rainer Veit, senior economist, Deutsche Bank:</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly a setback for hopes that the economy is gaining momentum,&quot; Veit told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't suppose today's labour market data will lead to any changes in forex rates. The Bundesbank can live with today's foreign exchange rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Shanda Persaud, San Paulo Bank, London:</p>
<p>&quot;German exports are up and domestic orders are down and that's coming through in these unemployment figures,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We wont nececessarily see an increase in the balance in favour of a repo cut. But it could make the Bundesbank think more about the direction of the economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>Matthias Haffner, BZW:</p>
<p>&quot;Its definitely a disappointment, and any hope that the recent positive economic indicators that we've seen during the last few months will already have an impact on the labour market have been proven false,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like companies are still very reluctant to hire new people, possibly also because of the insecurity with relation to changes in labour legislation, for example, in sick-pay.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether the data showed that economic growth was faltering, Haffner said &quot;Other economic indicators do not point in that direction yet. I do not believe that this single number is a sufficiently well-founded reason for the Bundesbank to think seriously again about lowering interest rates.&quot;</p>
