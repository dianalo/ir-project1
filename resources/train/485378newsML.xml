<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch ING group profits surge to record.</title>
<headline>Dutch ING group profits surge to record.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands</dateline>

<p>Financial services giant ING Groep NV said Thursday that its profits jumped by 25 percent to a record 3.32 billion guilders ($1.8 billion) last year.</p>
<p>The banking and insurance group, which said it would make a modest share offering in the United States, said almost all its banking, insurance and investment activities achieved considerably improved results.</p>
<p>Analysts applauded the results, which were at the upper end of expectations, and ING shares were steady in Amsterdam, defying the downtrend in the Dutch market.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong results achieved in 1996 are in part a reflection of the favourable general economic trends in the countries in which ING operates,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>ING, which rescued the collapsed British merchant bank Barings in 1995, said the consolidation of Barings and Poland's Bank Slaski contributed to a 34 percent jump in commission income and a 22 percent rise in operating spending.</p>
<p>The Dutch group said the excellent stock market climate also boosted commissions and was a factor in a 72 percent surge in securities trading income.</p>
<p>The increase came despite provisions before tax for future expenses, related partly to the cost of the introduction of a single European currency and computer and other changes related to the millennium.</p>
