<p>Residents of  Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, welcomed a truce agreed between the country's military rulers and other West African states, but many remained wary even though the ceasefire was holding on Saturday.</p>
<p>Junta envoys and foreign ministers from four countries representing the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) agreed at a meeting on Friday in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, on an immediate halt to all fighting in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceasefire...is holding on all the fronts,&quot; Sierra Leone military spokesman John Milton told reporters.</p>
<p>Nigerian troops seeking to reverse a May 25 coup that ousted civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah have clashed with junta forces and former rebel soldiers who rallied to the coup.</p>
<p>The question of whether Kabbah should return as president was left unresolved on Friday. The two sides will meet again on July 25 to discuss ways of restoring &quot;constitutional order&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We know now that they (the junta) are going,&quot; said one trader at the huge Victoria Park market in the centre of Freetown. &quot;It will only be a matter of months. We can wait. We have been through worse.&quot;</p>
<p>But one man in a bar declined to toast the Abidjan agreement with fellow drinkers.</p>
<p>&quot;I am angry about the outcome of the meeting. I did not want ECOWAS to give these khaki boys one more week to come back and discuss how and when they are going. That means we are going to continue to suffer under them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The price of rice had doubled, he said, and there were hardly any doctors left in Freetown.</p>
<p>&quot;If it wasn't for the Red Cross, which has opened some clinics in the city, many people would have died by now from sickness,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Junta officials in Abidjan said the end to hostilities meant that a crippling blockade of the country's borders, as well as the roads into Freetown and its main airport, would be lifted.</p>
<p>Some residents were worried about how undisciplined soldiers and rebels, who have already gone in for widespread looting, would respond to a call to return to their barracks.</p>
<p>State radio said on Saturday that the junta was cracking down on people masquerading as soldiers or policemen.</p>
<p>It also said that military leader Johnny Paul Koroma had addressed the army on Friday and reported him as saying: &quot;You are to report to your respective units and stop parading the streets aimlessly. Any soldier caught in the street without a valid pass will be severely dealt with.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately, the radio reported that the junta had called for a &quot;constructive dialogue&quot; with the secretariat of the Commonwealth after the 53-nation body, grouping former British colonies, suspended Sierra Leone on July 11.</p>
<p>The radio said Koroma had told the Commonwealth the junta wanted to restore democracy as soon as possible, and he had invited the secretariat to send a delegation to Freetown to discuss how this could be done.</p>
<p>The radio said a timetable for a return to democracy could have been laid down by now &quot;had it not been for the threat of armed violence in Sierra Leone caused by Nigeria&quot;.</p>
