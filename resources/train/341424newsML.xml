<headline>RESEARCH ALERT-NatWest lowers 3Com outlook.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- NatWest Securities analyst Stephen Koffler said he was lowering his revenue estimate for 3Com Corp's fiscal third quarter ending in February after the company &quot;came clean&quot; on sales channel weakness in December in an analysts meeting.</p>
<p>-- He reduced his third quarter revenue outlook to $855 million from $870 million.  Nonetheless, he said he expected the lower top line number to have negligible impact on 3Com's third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>-- Koffler maintained his 12-month target price of $95.  </p>
<p>-- In published comments, the analyst said he was &quot;not particularly impressed&quot; with 3Com's latest Fast IP news announcement.</p>
<p>-- Fast IP is designed to allow customers of 3Com's local area network products to seamlessly communicate over wide area network systems offered by companies like Cascade Communications Corp and Ipsilon Networks Inc.</p>
<p>-- &quot;We do not think (Fast IP) will make a dent in Cisco's dominance of the enterprise networking market,&quot; Koffler wrote, referring to 3Com's rivalry with Cisco Systems Inc, the recognized leader in the network equipment industry.</p>
<p>-- &quot;We believe that Cisco's tag switching will be extremely successful in the enterprise market and will probably eclipse 3Com's Fast IP,&quot; Koffler said.  Tag switching is Cisco's own technology for reducing Internet communications bottlenecks in end-to-end local- and wide-area networks.</p>
<p>-- Referring to the third quarter revenue softness, he said he was cutting his growth rate assumption for 3Com's core network adapter card business to the low 40 percent range from the high 40s, &quot;based on management's comments and our own channel checks in January.&quot;</p>
