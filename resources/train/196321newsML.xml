<p>The formal closing of Peru's Brady deal with its commercial creditors, originally scheduled for December 20, could be postponed until January, an Economy Ministry source said Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still working to close in 1996, but we are not certain that we will close in 1996,&quot; said a top ministry official, who asked not to be named.  </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the government signed a preliminary Brady bond debt accord with its commercial creditors containing most of the final details for the restructuring of $4.4 billion of principal and interest.</p>
<p>&quot;We were supposed to announce the closing date (last) Friday. We did not because we want to announce the date when we are sure we have everything in place for the closing,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The government still had many &quot;mechanical processes&quot; to finalize before the closing, he added, without giving details.  </p>
<p>Economy Ministry officials have said the precise financing of the Brady deal, and the &quot;reconciliation&quot; of some interest, or agreement with bank creditors on exactly how much interest is owed, are the main points still to finalized in the plan.</p>
<p>The government has said that 180 commercial creditors, accounting for 99 percent of the debt included in the agreement, had selected one or more of the options available in the plan which include discount bonds, par bonds, front-loaded interest rate bonds (Flirbs) and debt buyback.  </p>
<p>Creditors' initial selections have been for 50 percent of the debt total to be covered by front-loaded interest rate bonds, 30 percent by debt buyback, 15 percent in discount bonds and five percent par bonds.</p>
<p>However, Peruvian officials have said they want to reduce the Flirbs to 40 percent or less, and would prefer to increase the portion of discounts to around 25 percent.</p>
