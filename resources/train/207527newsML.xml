<p>The British Foreign Office said on Thursday it was calling in the Belarus ambassador to &quot;express concern&quot; at the political situation in the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has drawn wide international criticism for his plans to hold a referendum this weekend on widening his powers and his refusal to compromise with his parliamentary opponents.  </p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;We are calling in the Belarus ambassador tomorrow morning to express our own concern at the political situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Ambassador Vladzimir Shchasny would see Foreign Office Permanent Under Secretary Sir John Coles on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Hopes for a compromise between Lukashenko and his parliamentary opponents dimmed on Thursday after the Belarussian leader snubbed a Russian peace initiative.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, who stayed away from talks with Russian parliamentary leaders on Wednesday, pressed ahead with his campaign for a referendum on Sunday to widen his powers.</p>
