<p>Chinese researchers are racking their brains to make endangered giant pandas enjoy and engage in sex, the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Researchers...are studying techniques of enhancing the sexual desire and performance (of pandas),&quot; Xinhua said, quoting researchers at the Chengdu Giant Pandas Reproduction Research Base in the southwestern province of Sichuan.</p>
<p>&quot;Only 10 percent of giant pandas are able to mate naturally,&quot; one researcher said. &quot;So it's very difficult to have them make love and get pregnant naturally.&quot;</p>
<p>Pandas can become pregnant only once a year and give birth to one to two cubs at a time.</p>
<p>&quot;The female giant pandas always show indifference and contempt to the approaching male giant pandas during the mating season,&quot; the researcher said.</p>
<p>The breeding centre is also studying ways to improve the survival rate of baby pandas and has had modest success with artificial insemination, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>It has bred 42 giant pandas by artificial insemination since 1980, the news agency said. Only 23 survived and the rest died before they turned six months old.</p>
<p>Covering an area of 30 hectares (74 acres), the breeding centre houses about two dozen pandas.</p>
<p>Only 1,000 giant pandas exist in China's wilds, mostly in the bamboo forests of Sichuan province.</p>
<p>Their numbers have dwindled as humans encroach on their habitat and hunters kills them for their pelts, which can be sold for large sums.</p>
