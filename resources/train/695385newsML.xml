<title>USA: Boyd Gaming $250 mln junk bond deal postponed.</title>

<p>Boyd Gaming Corp has postponed a $250 million junk bond offering becuase it was unsatisfied with the price level available in the market, a Boyd spokesman said.</p>
<p>The company planned to raise $250 million though an offering of senior subordinated notes to refinance debt including $185 million in outstanding 11 percent senior subordinated notes.</p>
<p>A Boyd spokesman said Boyd hopes to raise the funds via a note offering &quot;when pricing makes the most sense for the company.&quot; He declined further comment.  </p>
<p>Salomon Brothers Inc, the underwriter of the offering, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Market sources said that Boyd had originally hoped to price the 10-year bonds (B1/BB-) around 300 basis points over comparable Treasuries.</p>
<p>It was unable to achieve that price primarily due to poor market conditions created by the recently large number of new junk bond issues, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of this is also a reflection on the gaming sector,&quot; said one high-yield bond gaming analyst. &quot;A lot of people recognize that the gaming sector is very rich and very few are willing to put new money to work in it.&quot;</p>
<p>The analyst suspected Boyd is likely to reattempt the offering before December 1, 1997, when its 11 percent bonds become callable.</p>
