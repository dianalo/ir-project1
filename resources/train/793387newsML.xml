<title>CANADA: BASF, BOOTS FACE CANADA LAWSUIT.</title>
<headline>BASF, BOOTS FACE CANADA LAWSUIT.</headline>
<dateline>VANCOUVER 1997-08-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Canadian lawyer has launched a class action lawsuit over the thyroid medication Synthroid against Germany's BASF AG, Boots Co Plc of Britain and affiliated companies in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Lawyer David Klein said he had filed a writ of summons in British Columbia launching the lawsuit under class action legislation. A judge has not yet ruled whether the suit qualifies for class action status.</p>
<p>The suit names BASF, its Knoll Pharmaceutical Co subsidiary in the United States, Knoll Pharma Inc in Canada, other BASF units in Canada and the United States, Boots and its U.S. subsidiary.</p>
<p>According to a copy of the filing provided by Klein, the action alleges Boots and Knoll &quot;took affirmative steps to conceal&quot; from the public the results of a 1987 research study that found Synthroid was no more effective than two cheaper generic drugs also used as thyroid medication.</p>
<p>The companies &quot;waged a campaign to discredit the study and block its publication&quot; to prevent regulators and doctors &quot;from learning that Synthroid was bioequivalent to cheaper preparations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the defendants' knowledge of the findings of the study, they continued to represent to prescribing physicians that their product, Synthroid, was superior to other less expensive preparations of levothyroxine,&quot; the suit alleges.</p>
<p>The legal action follows news earlier this month that Knoll had reached an agreement in principle to settle a series of class action lawsuits in the United States. That settlement involves payment of US$98 million by the company if the class has five million or fewer members.</p>
<p>The settlement stemmed from an US$8.5 billion suit filed in April. That suit said Knoll controlled 84 percent of the US$600 million levothyroxine market in the United States.</p>
<p>Asked to respond to the Canadian lawsuit, Knoll Pharma Inc in Markham, Ontario issued a statement saying that the &quot;efficacy and safety of Synthroid were not issues in the study or settlement.&quot; It also said that none of the generic drugs used in the study have ever been available in Canada.</p>
<p>The Canadian unit also reissued an earlier statement from Knoll in the United States saying that the U.S. settlement in no way implied or acknowledged any wrongdoing and was undertaken to avoid expensive litigation. It also criticized the original study.</p>
<p>BASF acquired Boots' drug division including Synthroid in 1995. Boots officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The British Columbia lawsuit is open to any resident of Canada, except those of Ontario and Quebec, who bought Synthroid starting in 1991.</p>
