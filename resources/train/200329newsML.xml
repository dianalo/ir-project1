<p>Indian call money ended Tuesday easier on reduced demand for funds with closing quotes at 10 percent against the day's opening 10.25-10.50 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most of the day's deals were done around 10.25 percent, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a distinctly softish tone today,&quot; a dealer at a foreign bank said. &quot;Rates kept drifting down through the day as there was not much demand for funds.&quot;</p>
<p>He said call money was expected to remain easy during the rest of the week as the banks' reporting Friday approached.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for funds will ease as Friday comes closer,&quot; he said. &quot;This will ease pressure on call money rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Prices of government securities remained steady in dull trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are few buyers in the market at the moment,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;With market players uncertain which way call money rates will move, there is some nervousness...There are mainly sellers in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The 13.50 percent 1997 government of India stock traded on Tuesday at 102.45 rupees against its last traded price of 102.50 while the 13.50 percent 1998 stock was unchanged at 102.43 rupees, dealers said.</p>
<p>No trades were reported in certificates of deposit and commercial paper.</p>
