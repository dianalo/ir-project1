<p>President Mobutu Sese Seko has thrown his weight behind moves to send home more than a million Hutu refugees caught at the centre of warfare in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Canada stepped forward on Tuesday with an offer to lead a multinational force to secure food aid and passage for the refugees scattered by three weeks of violence in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called on the United Nations Security Council to authorise sending a relief force to Zaire &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If the world does not act, more than a million lives are at stake,&quot; Chretien told a news conference in Ottawa.</p>
<p>But judging by the firm statement by Mobutu -- until now the protector of Hutus who fear revenge at home for a massacre of Tutsis -- the force's main task would be providing safe conduct back to Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;The refugees are the source of many problems,&quot; Mobutu told a television interviewer in France where he is convalescing after cancer surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;So everyone should go home and each government take the responsibility of looking after its citizens,&quot; he said in the interview broadcast on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Most of the Hutus are Rwandans who fled after the 1994 massacre of up to a million Tutsis or their sympathisers. But some are Burundians who fled massacres in their own homeland.</p>
<p>The governments of Rwanda and Burundi, both led by Tutsis, as well as the Zaire authorities, want the Hutus back in their countries. So do ethnic Tutsi rebels who have seized Zaire's two eastern provinces where refugee camps were located.</p>
<p>Many of the refugees say they want to go home but that they are being prevented by armed Hutu hardliners, most of them former Rwandan soldiers who led the 1994 genocide.</p>
<p>Hardline Hutus, apparently using refugees as human shields, are battling ethnic Tutsis around Mugunga camp near Goma. The situation in the camp has been unclear since the Tutsis defeated the Zairean army in recent fighting.</p>
<p>Most of 1.2 million camp refugees and hundreds of thousands of Zairean villagers fled into the jungle, where aid workers say thousands could die of hunger or disease.</p>
<p>Chretien said the first Canadian troops could be deployed within 48 hours of a U.N. decision. The first deployment would be a special 350-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), formed by the Canadian military to provide humanitarian relief at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of Canada I am urging the United Nations Security Council to pass a resolution mandating a Canadian-led international military force to take action as soon as possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chretien said Canada would initially contribute up to 1,500 personnel to any multinational force and this could rise to between 6,000 and 10,000 when the force was fully deployed.</p>
<p>Among the countries that have expressed a willingness to join the force are France, Spain, Italy, South Africa, Ethiopia and Mali. Still key to the operation are anticipated responses from the United States and Britain before the U.N. Security Council formally approves the operation.</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday inched closer to a decision on whether to support the dispatch of a multinational force.</p>
<p>A military-led U.S. assessment team has been sent to the troubled Central African region.</p>
<p>The White House and State Department said no decision had been made yet on whether to back such a force or whether Washington would play any role, such as contributing troops.</p>
<p>&quot;It's (Canadian leadership proposal) on the table. It's in play. It's something we're actively considering,&quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.</p>
<p>France has been pushing for a multinational force to go into Zaire but it is not trusted by the Rwanda government, which accuses Paris of helping Hutu killers escape during a similar intervention by French troops in 1994.</p>
<p>Major powers, notably the United States and Britain, also reacted coolly to the French idea but have lately warmed up to some form of participation.</p>
<p>How the force goes in, and notably where the French are stationed, would have to take account of the strong views of both Rwanda and Zaire whose consent is key, diplomats say.</p>
<p>Aid sources in the Zairean capital said the military operation would most likely be based in Zaire and go along with Zaire's demand for a protected east-west corridor along which the refugees could return home.</p>
<p>U.N. envoy Raymond Chretien, who is negotiating a mandate for the intervention force, returned to Kinshasa on Tuesday for talks with Zaire authorities, continuing his shuttle diplomacy between Zaire and Rwanda.</p>
