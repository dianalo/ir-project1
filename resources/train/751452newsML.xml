<p>The Israeli cabinet approved an 800 million shekel cut in the 1997 budget after a stormy meeting that stretched into the early hours of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The cabinet voted 12-4 in favour of the cuts proposed by the Treasury with some adjustments put forward by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The cuts included 600 million shekels from general operating budgets, 180 million shekels to make up for Israel's agreement to transfer $50 million in U.S. aid to Jordan, and 20 million shekels to fund distribution of gas masks to the public.</p>
<p>In the session described by observers as turbulent, Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai walked out in protest against cuts in defence spending.</p>
<p>Instead of an across-the-board 0.6 percent cut in all ministry budgets, cuts in the labour and welfare, education and health ministries were cut by 0.4 percent while cuts in other ministries were increased to 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>The defence ministry cut was preserved at 0.6 percent.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman, speaking to reporters after the vote, expressed satisfaction with the result.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has met its commitments regarding the budgetary deficit target as fixed in the law,&quot; Neeman said, adding that &quot;1997 shows the way for the 1998 budget.&quot;</p>
<p>The cuts were the third round of budget slashing since the draft 1997 budget was presented last autumn. The government had earlier approved some 7 billion shekels in cuts and revenue raising measures.</p>
<p>But slower than expected economic growth forced the government to retrench further.</p>
<p>The latest round of cuts are aimed at preserving the deficit at 2.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). That figure is slated to fall to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1998.</p>
<p>Asked whether the cuts would allow the government to meet the 1997 deficit target, Neeman said: &quot;We will make every effort to achieve this.&quot;</p>
<p>Treasury sources said earlier this week it was unlikely that the target would be reached unless there were cuts amounting to about 2 billion shekels.</p>
<p>The Treasury is due to begin its first discussions on the 1998 budget next week.</p>
<p>Neeman said the smaller cuts in the labour and welfare, education and health budgets were intended to help those ministries cope with their budgetary crises. The three ministers were nevertheless among those who voted against the cuts.</p>
<p>In a statement issued prior to the meeting, Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel said the 600 million shekel general budget cut was the minimum required to keep the deficit on target.</p>
<p>&quot;Failure to hold to the deficit target will strike a blow to the confidence in the government's economic policy and Israel's financial standing, as expressed in the country's credit risk rating in world financial and money markets,&quot; the central bank said in a statement.</p>
