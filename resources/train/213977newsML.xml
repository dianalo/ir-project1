<p>A high turnout in a controversial referendum in Belarus appeared to point to victory for hardline President Alexander Lukashenko's plans to rewrite the country's constitution as Belarus waited to hear its fate on Monday.</p>
<p>Lidiya Yermoshina, put in charge of running the voting by Lukashenko after he sacked her predecessor who had criticised the referendum, said on state television that turnout when polls closed was 84.05 percent, or 6,161,686 people.</p>
<p>&quot;The election has taken place...The counting of the results is being carried out openly,&quot; she said, speaking after the 6,500 polling stations closed at 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Sunday.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted sources in Lukashenko's administration as saying most voters had backed the president, who wants to widen his powers and extend his term beyond 2000.</p>
<p>Yermoshina's predecessor, Viktor Gonchar, who was appointed by parliament and had vowed not to approve the results, told Reuters it was clear the turnout figure had been falsified.</p>
<p>&quot;Even during the presidential campaign (in 1994), when political activity was at its highest, it was lower. The figures are simply fantastic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gonchar said the turnout in big towns had been particularly high during the last four hours of voting. &quot;This would be understandable in summer, but not in late November,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Preliminary results were not available at Yermoshina's Central Commission for Elections and Referendums, but Itar-Tass news agency quoted an unnamed commission official as saying that a majority of voters had backed Lukashenko.</p>
<p>At least half of the registered 7.2 million voters have to say &quot;yes&quot; to Lukashenko's new constitution, one of seven questions on the complex ballot paper, for him to claim victory. Voting began on November 9.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, 42, scheduled a mid-morning news conference and appeared confident of trouncing his parliamentary opponents after a one-sided campaign in which he monopolised the media and sacked the head of the electoral commission.</p>
<p>He told voters they lived in &quot;a small island of order and stability in an ocean of chaos and anarchy&quot; which covered the rest of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>A five-member European parliament team arrived in Minsk at the invitation of parliament speaker Semyon Sharetsky to monitor the overnight count.</p>
<p>But its leader Herbert Bosch told Reuters it had not been allowed to watch the count but it had not sought accreditation in advance as &quot;it would have gone too far in terms of validating the referendum&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some irregularities yesterday, but the question is whether the whole procedure is regular or not,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not understand why Russia only needs one day to carry out a referendum while little Belarus needs two weeks,&quot; he added, referring to early voting which is permitted in the country's existing constitution.</p>
<p>Lukashenko has ignored Western criticism of his increasingly authoritarian rule under which the media have been gagged, free trade unions banned and leading nationalist opponents have fled into exile.</p>
<p>Several hundred people demonstrated in Minsk against Lukashenko on polling day but the capital was otherwise calm, reflecting Lukashenko's control over the security apparatus and the lack of strong opposition leadership in the republic bordering Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Rural voters in Belarussia's thousands of villages looked certain to give their support to Lukashenko's plans to rewrite the constitution to extend his term in office and increase his control over rival institutions.</p>
<p>However, the president, in genial mood as he voted on Sunday, ruled out any immediate move to dissolve parliament, where deputies are trying to impeach the president.</p>
<p>The outcome of the poll, decreed by Lukashenko to be mandatory, was being closely watched in Russia, which brokered a compromise between Lukashenko and parliament on Friday which collapsed after less than a day.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, the most pro-Russian of all leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, has effectively blunted criticism from Moscow of his policies by identifying himself as the guarantor of closer integration between the two states.</p>
