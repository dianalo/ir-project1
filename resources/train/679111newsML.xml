<p>The body of a murdered French woman has been found in a well in the Algerian village of Bouzeguene, 90 km (60 miles) east of Algiers, an Algerian newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 55-year old woman, married to an Algerian, had regularly spent her holidays in the Berber village, said Liberte newspaper, quoting local residents. It said the woman was killed &quot;some days ago&quot;.</p>
<p>Her suspected murderer had been arrested as he was trying to flee to neighbouring Libya, said the newspaper.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the murder was linked to Algeria's political violence pitting Moslem guerrillas against the North African country's government.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people, including more than 100 foreigners, have died in the five and half years of strife. Most of the foreigners were French nationals.</p>
