<title>USA: Union Texas to buy share in Algeria blocks.</title>
<headline>Union Texas to buy share in Algeria blocks.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Incm said Thursday that it has agreed to buy a 30 percent working interest in an exploration joint venture in the Ghadames Basin in Algeria.</p>
<p>Union Texas is acquiring its interest in two blocks in the Ghadames Basin from Phillips Petroleum Co Algeria, a subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum Co, which will remain operator and holds the remaining 70 percent working interest, Union Texas said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Since 1990, at least 10 new hydrocarbon discoveries have been made in the Ghadames Basin, which are believed to total in excess of 2 billion barrels of oil.</p>
<p>&quot;This joint venture in the Bordj Messouda Blocks offers Union Texas an outstanding opportunity to enter a high-quality exploration play in Algeria,&quot; said Union Texas Chairman and CEO John Whitmire.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the past several years, a number of very significant oil discoveries have been made in this highly prolific area in Algeria. We believe this area holds superior exploration potential and we are excited to join this venture.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Bordj Messouda joint venture represents the seventh new exploration venture that Union Texas has joined since early 1997. In previous announcements, Union Texas has reported that it is joining new ventures in China, Yemen, Jordan, Bolivia, Greece and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Union Texas also reported today that it has received final approval from the Natural Resources Authority of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to acquire a 50 percent working interest from a subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corp in an oil and gas production-sharing contract in Jordan. Two stratigraphic test wells are planned to be drilled in 1997 to evaluate the area's stratigraphic column and confirm the presence of a working petroleum system.</p>
<p>Union Texas also is pursuing other high-potential exploration ventures to further expand its exploration portfolio. The company plans to participate in 25 to 30 exploration wells during 1997, including exploration programs at its producing ventures in the U.K. North Sea, Indonesia and Pakistan, up from 13 exploration wells in 1996.</p>
