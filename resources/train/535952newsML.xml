<p>U.S.-EU meat talks this week were constructive and some progress was made, but there was still no deal reached to settle a fight over meat imports, said Agriculture Department trade adviser Paul Drazek.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a constructive meeting, with as usual some bumps in the road, but some progress was made,&quot; said Drazek in an interview with Reuters Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We narrowed the differences overall this past week, but the differences aren't gone,&quot; said Drazek. But saying the talks were in a &quot;sensitive stage,&quot; he refused to expand on exactly what differences were narrowed.  </p>
<p>Drazek said that the issue of decontamination in the U.S. poultry process remains a &quot;major problem and still a concern.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The use of antimicrobial treatments (in poultry) is still an issue between us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Senior EU negotiator Lars Hoelgaard briefed reporters earlier before he and other EU officials returned to Europe, and he said there had been constructive talks on poultry.</p>
<p>When asked if the two sides were closer on the poultry issue, however, Drazek said, &quot;I don't want to say yes or no.&quot;</p>
<p>Drazek also refused to answer if an agreement excluding poultry was being considered. &quot;I think it would be best if I didn't answer that at this point,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Drazek noted that the so-called regionalization issue has suddenly become important again, but said the U.S. position is that it had been resolved some time ago.</p>
<p>He said Europe wants Washington to treat it as one entity, and that U.S. officials said they would do as much as they can &quot;in the scope of our statutes and regulations.&quot;</p>
<p>The failure to reach an agreement in the veterinary equivalency talks has already halted U.S. poultry shipments to Europe. Washington has said it will remove over 100 European meat and poultry plants from its list of approved exporters on April 30 if no agreement is reached, which could stop some $300 million worth of EU meat exports.</p>
