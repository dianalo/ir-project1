<title>JAPAN: Tokyo naphtha prices hit lowest level in 6 months.</title>

<dateline>TOKYO 1997-04-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tokyo naphtha prices nosedived to a six-month low in afternoon trade on Monday due to planned naphtha cracker turnarounds in South Korea in May, arbitrage cargoes from the West as well as bearish crudes, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a reaction to Western cargoes coming and Korean shutdowns, plus weaker crudes,&quot; one naphtha trader said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for the prompt trading period, which now is first-half June, was quoted at $208.00/209.50 per tonne, the lowest since early October.</p>
<p>It was assessed at about $213.00/214.50 in late dealing on Friday.  </p>
<p>Second-half June was indicated a scant 50 cents lower than than the first-half June level. On Friday, one second-half June cargo was traded at $215.00 and another one at $214.00.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices have been sliding constantly since mid-March in line with crudes, after having shot up by more than 30 percent in the second half of 1996.</p>
<p>Traders expected prompt naphtha cargoes to find a bottom soon, and not to fall below the $200 level because the arbitrage window from Europe is currently closed.</p>
<p>In spreads, the backwardation was squeezed further, with first-half June/first-half July discussed at 50 cents/$1.50</p>
