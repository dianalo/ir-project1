<p>British broker Willis Corroon Group Plc said on Friday the decision to liquidate its Sovereign Marine &amp; General Insurance subsidiary would have no financial impact on the group.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, expressed concern about the effect on the group's broker relationships.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a moral issue here that this leading global broker has walked away from some of its responsibilities, albeit that Sovereign has been in run-off for some years. They don't think they can be sued and any action will have to be taken against Sovereign,&quot; said Merrill Lynch insurance analyst Roman Cizdyn.</p>
<p>Willis shares fell 10 pence to 133-1/2 pence after news of the move, following the unexpectedly adverse outcome of the arbitration of a dispute with a reinsurer of two of Sovereign's casualty surplus treaties.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the company described the share price reaction as &quot;knee-jerk&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no financial impact other than the removal of what people had been concerned about for some time - the need to make further provisions,&quot; said Willis director of corporate communications Peter Stevens.</p>
<p>The provision question, however, was not the end of the matter according to Credit Lyonnais analyst Robin Savage.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike a stand alone insurance company, this insurance underwritng operation is owned by a broker, which has relationships across the world,&quot; said Credit Lyonnais insurance analyst Robin Savage.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is can it actually stand by and let its underwriting operation go into insolvent liquidation and not make the payments. If it does, what is that going to do to is broking business?&quot;</p>
<p>Stevens said the circumstances surrounding the arbitration were confidential.</p>
<p>But he said neither Willis nor its legal advisers had expected the award, which had prompted the directors of Sovereign to request further financial help.</p>
<p>That led Willis to decide it was no longer in shareholders' interests to suport Sovereign, said Stevens.</p>
<p>Provisional liquidators have been appointed to Sovereign, which ceased underwriting and was placed into run-off during 1991.</p>
<p>Sovereign's underwriting reserves were strengthened in 1991 and 1992, resulting in underwriting losses of 58 million stg being charged against the group's results for those years.</p>
<p>Further underwriting losses totalling 14.8 million stg were similarly charged in the subsequent four years.</p>
