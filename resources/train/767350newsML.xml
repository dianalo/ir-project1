<p>Australian shares are expected to continue their strong run for the rest of 1997 despite the subdued reaction to the cut in official cash rates announced on Wednesday, equity strategists said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think for the longer term it is undeniably a positive for the market,&quot; Bankers Trust Investment Bank equity strategist David Rees told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia cut official cash rates by 50 basis points to 5.0 percent, which edged the All Ordinaries index up 11.9 points to 2,743.8 by 2.20 p.m (0420 GMT).  </p>
<p>The cut was largely priced into the share market after the release of inflation and wages data last week and it is now expected to digest the forthcoming corporate reporting season before it takes it next cue, equity strategists said.</p>
<p>Economists said lower rates would reduce corporate borrowing costs and the monetary easing would boost economic activity, both of which should result in higher future earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the impact will come from company earnings to the extent that the rate cut will give confidence that earnings in cyclical industrials will start to improve,&quot; said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Society.  </p>
<p>Equity strategists said the rate could stimulate the housing sector and benefit companies ranging from building suppliers to household goods manufactures. Engineering groups, retailers and media are also seen winning from an expected economic pick-up.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the more significant impact for companies will be on the demand side in respect to what it does to the housing sector and retail spending,&quot; Bankers Trust's Rees said.</p>
<p>&quot;It helps companies on the interest cost side, but it is market expansion that is the more important factor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The RBA said economic growth in 1997 had been picking up, but it remained moderate.  </p>
<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the March quarter. This growth rate is likely to be reflected in subdued corporate earnings for the year to June 30.</p>
<p>Strategists said monetary easing was timely as it will give companies something positive to say for the 1997/98 earnings period after a flat 1996/97 year.</p>
<p>&quot;What the reporting season is telling us is that things have been tough, but companies may think things are going to be less tough in the future,&quot; Rees said.  </p>
<p>Rees said there was a reasonable prospect that there might be stronger earnings growth over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index has risen about 13 percent since the start of 1997, hitting a record high of 2,757.9 on July 3, but has consolidated since then.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Australia chief economist Dennis Mahoney said the interest rate cut was good news for the market, but it was no surprise that there was little movement in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment I think the share market is very wary of good news,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;You would have thought with bond yields looking good, the dollar holding up, that the share market would be more buoyant than it is,&quot; Mahoney said.</p>
<p>Bond yields are near their lowest level since deregulation of the financial markets in the early 1980s. The Australian 10-year treasury bond was seven basis points down 6.47 percent.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar took the easing in its stride, rising above the US$0.7450 level.</p>
<p>Strategists said the market will now have to wait for the expected economic boost.  </p>
<p>&quot;Unemployment and retail sales will need to pick up over the next couple of months. If they don't, they will be factoring in another cut,&quot; said Bob Hogg economist strategist at Commonwealth Financial Services.</p>
