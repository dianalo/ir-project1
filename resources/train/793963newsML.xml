<p>The Central Bank of Tunisia has issued 12.5 billion yen worth of 4.35 percent 20-year samurai bonds due August 15, 2017, banking sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The samurai bonds were priced at par, with twice-yearly coupon payments.</p>
<p>&quot;The launch was at first for 10 billion yen, and because it was successful, it was increased by 25 percent to 12.5 billion yen at the demand of the issue's lead manager Nikko Securities Co Ltd,&quot; a banker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Over 50 percent of the issue was subscribed by Japanese investors and the remainder by institutional investors in other financial places,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The deal was signed on August 6  by a the Tunisian Central Bank with the issue's lead manager Nikko Securities Co Ltd and lead trustee Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>It was Tunisia's sixth samurai issue since 1994, taking the total amount to 112.5 million yen.</p>
<p>&quot;This sixth issue won a longer maturity of 20 years, the previous maturities were between five and 15 years,&quot; a banker noted.</p>
<p>Banking sources said there was talk in the debt market that Tunisia was planning its first issue on the U.S. debt market. It would be Tunisia's first issue on the yankee market.</p>
<p>&quot;The last long term samurai issue confirms that the Tunisian risk is accepted by foreign investors,&quot; a banker said.</p>
<p>Tunisia's long term ratings are BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's, BBB+ by the Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI), and BBB3 by Moody's.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said in April 1997 the outlook on Tunisia's rating was stable and that it reflected solid public finance, a conservative monetary policy track record, a moderate external debt and debt service, gradual removal of price, trade, credit and labour market distortions.</p>
