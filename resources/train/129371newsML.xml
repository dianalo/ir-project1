<p>Germany's ruling Christian Democrats (CDU) open an annual congress on Monday that could be a triumphal procession for Chancellor Helmut Kohl if his own allies would only stop raining on his parade.</p>
<p>Kohl, 66, will soon set the record as the longest-serving post-war chancellor.  Already in the history books as the man who reunited his divided nation, he towers over the political scene both in Germany and across Europe.</p>
<p>But his 14-year government flirted with collapse last week as it struggled to square the circle of lowering its budget deficit to qualify for monetary union in Europe without angering voters by raising taxes back home.</p>
<p>Critics in the ruling party's ranks say his goal of halving widespread unemployment by the year 2000 is an illusion and his assurances about the solvency of the pension system are hollow.</p>
<p>Even one of Kohl's closest aides, Eduard Ackermann, sees a rough ride ahead for the coalition of the CDU, the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free Democrats (FDP).</p>
<p>&quot;In the next two years, the CDU, CSU and FDP will have their hands full trying to convince their voters they are better at dealing with the economic and financial problems facing our country,&quot; wrote the communications advisor who was in Kohl's &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; from 1982 until he retired in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Conflicts over labour and social policies in Germany will certainly get even worse over the next few years,&quot; Ackermann wrote in his new book &quot;Politicians.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl, who will overtake his mentor Konrad Adenauer as Bonn's longest-serving chancellor on October 31, has no worry about being reelected CDU chairman in the leadership votes due at the two-day congress in the northern city of Hanover.</p>
<p>But a planned debate about tax reform, meant to portray the party as a beacon shining towards a more competitve and prosperous Germany, will be overshadowed by the embarrassing flip-flops the government performed over its budget last week.</p>
<p>They highlighted the problems Kohl faces as he tries to downsize Germany's comfortable welfare state, squeeze budget deficits into the tight Maastricht corset, govern with a razor-thin majority and still hand out the favours that have kept his voters happy all these years.</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD), flexing their majority muscles in parliament's upper house, threw Finance Minister Theo Waigel's budget sums off by billions of marks by refusing to delay a planned increase in child benefit payments.</p>
<p>Waigel's CSU and the liberal FDP, whose main vote-getter is its ceaseless call for tax cuts, then squabbled for days over whether to raise petrol tax to fill the gap.  There were times when the centre-right coalition looked doomed.</p>
<p>In the end, they put off a promised cut in yet another tax, the hated solidarity surcharge levied to help rebuild the ex-communist east.  It all smacked of cynical horse-trading and the shaky FDP lost a tax cut it had staked its reputation on.</p>
<p>&quot;A tragic situation -- whatever the government did, it was bound to lose face,&quot; the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote.</p>
<p>Kohl suffered another setback recently over his plan to reduce generous sick pay benefits.</p>
<p>The government passed a bill allowing the cuts but scrambled for cover when workers staged wildcat strikes.</p>
<p>Kohl, whom the Sueddeutsche Zeitung recently called &quot;the status quo personified,&quot; has long profited from the confusion and rivalries that have torn apart the opposition SPD.</p>
<p>But the latest opinion poll by the Elections Research Group produced a standoff between the two blocs in parliament -- 46 percent for the government and 46 percent for a potential coalition of the SPD and the environmentalist Greens.</p>
<p>In a hint that historical stature need not lead to votes at the polls, 68 percent of those responding said Kohl had done well during his 14 years in office -- but only 48 percent wanted him to run for re-election in 1998.</p>
