<p>British business chiefs on Wednesday welcomed the government's &quot;new deal&quot; to combat youth unemployment, but some they said they still had some doubts about how the scheme would work.</p>
<p>Bosses from more than 40 top UK companies attended a working breakfast with Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown where he sought their support for his &quot;welfare-to-work&quot; scheme, the centrepiece of the July 2 budget.</p>
<p>He needs companies to sign up to the scheme which offers state subsidies to firms willing to take on young unemployed people for six months of work experience and training.</p>
<p>&quot;Directionally this is a good idea, but it will only be a good idea practically if it is based on new jobs and not job substitution,&quot; Dixons Group Plc's deputy chairman Mark Souhami told Reuters after the breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;Providing the government looks at this as a long- term plan -- which it assures us it does -- it would be churlish for business not to give it support.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the principal worries is that companies will simply use the scheme as a source of cheap labour and cut the size of their staff accordingly.</p>
<p>But John Neill, group chief executive of Unipart who was also at the breakfast, said this would not happen.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not going to be a process for getting cheap employment in the short term. We will try and find some young people who want to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>And Ian McAllister, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said there was a strong case for giving young people the very basic skills to make them employable.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the problems we have had is that many of them don't have the necessary basic skills in order to make them acceptable to employers.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown told the business chiefs the programme was crucial to break the &quot;vicious downward cycle&quot; of unskilled youngsters spending lifetimes out of work.</p>
<p>Three billion pounds of public money will fund the scheme, which will be piloted in January for an official launch in April.</p>
<p>The cash comes from a one-off windfall tax on the profits of recently privatised utilities, which will hear details of the levy in the budget.</p>
<p>Peter Davis, chief executive of insurance giant Prudential and head of the welfare-to-work programme, said this jobs scheme was markedly different to previous efforts to help the unemployed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a long-term scheme, not a short term fix, which is the key difference,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Also, it is more flexible, combining training and employment for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>The government will give companies up to 750 pounds to help meet the cost of training each young person taken on.</p>
<p>Business chiefs said they saw differences too.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the nice things about this is we have not been given a scheme and told to get on with it. What struck me this morning is the way the government is prepared to be flexible. Its a very different approach from usual,&quot; said Dixons' Souhami.</p>
<p>But a representative of smaller businesses said while he welcomed some aspects of the scheme, he had clear reservations.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very pleased the government is looking at making the administration as simple as possible, like combining it as far as possible with existing forms so it doesn't lead to unnecessary work,&quot; said Donald Martin, chairman of economic affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;But it already has all the hallmarks of being run by big business when the reality is that a lot of big firms are actually shedding staff. One has to wonder if this scheme will help them cut their costs.&quot;</p>
