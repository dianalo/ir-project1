<text>
<p>New York State Gov George Pataki on Thursday proposed a new $50 million pool for new taxpayer relief to promote jobs, but declined to disclose details as the plan is being thrashed out with lawmakers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are some areas where we should look for specific reductions, but I'll wait until we have those negotiations with the Assembly and the Senate to talk about those,&quot; he told reporters in Albany.</p>
<p>In a sign of the fight brewing over how successful the Pataki Administration has been in creating new jobs, the governor lashed out at Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan), who has been highly critical.</p>
<p>&quot;...Every time we have worked to cut taxes more, the Speaker has been reluctant and at times blocked those (incentives), so we're just going to continue with what we know is the right course to improve the economic climate in this state,&quot; said Pataki.</p>
<p>The governor on Wednesday, in his State of the State address, proposed a new, multi-year plan to cut property taxes. Pataki is due to disclose his budget for fiscal 1998 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Silver on Wednesday said that New York state's economic rebound was lagging sharply behind the country's recovery from the recession. &quot;While the nation has been riding the train of economic recovery for the last two years, New York is still waiting at the station, and that is deeply troubling to me,&quot; he said, in prepared remarks.</p>
