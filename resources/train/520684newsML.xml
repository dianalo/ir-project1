<p>Lawmakers sparred Friday over legislation to would boost cigarette taxes to pay for health insurance for children, with an opponent saying the increase would never fly and could hurt efforts to get a bill.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Arlen Specter told a Senate Labour Committee hearing the legislation to nearly triple the federal cigarette tax likely would not pass. He warned that lawmakers would &quot;debate taxes and not childrens' health care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This issue should move ahead without becoming embroiled in the tax issue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Specter has introduced a bill to cover about 40 percent of the 10 million uninsured children through state block grants and vouchers to families. He would fund it by having the federal government sell part its public broadcast assets to private companies.</p>
<p>But Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, under fire from party leaders, refused to back away from a childrens' health bill he has introduced with Massachusetts Demcocrat Edward Kennedy that would nearly triple the 24-cents-per-pack tax.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't do anything here there are 10 million kids (without insurance),&quot; Hatch told the committee. &quot;I can't think of a better funding source than the very industry that's causing a lot of problems in our society.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hatch-Kennedy bill would increase the federal tobacco tax to 67 cents per pack from the current 24 cents, raising $30 billion over five years. Two-thirds of that money would go to states to set up childrens' health programmes. The other $10 billion would be used for deficit reduction.</p>
<p>A bipartisan coalition introduced a similar bill in the House. The measure would cover at least 5 million children.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott does not support Hatch's proposal and Utah Republican Robert Bennett last week removed his name as a sponsor, saying he had made a mistake.</p>
<p>After his testimony, reporters asked Hatch whether any Republicans had refused to co-sponsor his bill due to pressure from the leadership. &quot;No one said that directly,&quot; he answered.</p>
<p>While not endorsing all the specifics of the Hatch-Kennedy bill, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said he believed a tobacco tax was a reasonable funding mechanism. &quot;The cigarette tax is not an unpopular tax to raise, except perhaps within the confines of the (Capital) beltway,&quot; Dean, a Democrat, testified.</p>
<p>He said Vermont's programme of expanded health coverage for uninsured children had more than paid for itself through better health outcomes and a satisfied public.</p>
<p>&quot;In a country where we are willing to cover everyone over age 65 without regard to the ability to pay, why are we unwilling to do the same for kids?&quot; he asked.</p>
