<p>Economic factors, especially high interest rates, are likely to keep depressed Indian stocks under pressure again this week, analysts and brokers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The worst thing is high interest rates. It is killing the industry,&quot; broker Rohit Chothani said.</p>
<p>Prime lending rates have fallen from a peak of 20 percent per year but are still high at 15.5-18 percent. Banks are flush with funds but there are few takers.</p>
<p>The prime rate is the interest that banks charge their blue-chip clients. Other firms have to pay 18-22 percent.</p>
<p>Traders expect the Bombay Stock Exchange's top-30 stocks index to be range-bound this week.</p>
<p>The index rose 59.25 points, or 1.91 percent, to 3,160.52 last week following a tumble of 153.46 points, or 4.71 percent, the previous week.</p>
<p>High deposit rates of 14 percent and a perceived rise in government borrowings are two factors bankers cite for current high lending rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't see long-term interest rates falling. The outlook is grim,&quot; said Rajashekar Iyer, research head at Bombay-based Kotak Securities.</p>
<p>He said government borrowings were almost certain to rise because depressed market conditions made it difficult to plan divestment in state firms.</p>
<p>Analysts said curtailed cash flows, slowing offtakes and inventory pile-ups and higher working capital requirements would erode bottom lines of companies.</p>
<p>They said the central Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was expected to inject liquidity into the system to bring down interest rates when it announced its monetary policy for the second half of fiscal 1996/97 (April-March).</p>
<p>Bankers said the policy was not expected to be announced before next Saturday.</p>
<p>The policy for the next six-months, a busy season due to higher demand for funds because of crop harvests, is usually announced by the first week of October.</p>
<p>&quot;Any measures announced by RBI which have the effect of lowering interest rates is expected to spur demand and help prop the sagging industrial growth,&quot; Nucleus Securities said.</p>
<p>A loosening of purse strings would stoke inflation which is already on the upsurge. But some analysts believe this will lure buyers to stocks from debt instruments.</p>
<p>Inflation, measured by the wholesale price indiex, is currently hovering around 6.0 percent, compared with around 5.0 percent for the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;From a foreign investor's viewpoint, inflation would eventually push down the value of the rupee... but a gain in the stock market as local investors switched out of debt into equity would probably more than outweigh exchange losses.&quot; Rupa Bose, of Paribas Capital Markets, said in a recent report.</p>
<p>The reporting season moves into full gear this week with Reliance Industries scheduled to release on Friday results for the first six months to September 30.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of analysts projected the petrochemical major's earnings would shrink 25 percent, hit by poor market conditions.</p>
<p>But the share price of electrical machinery firm Asea Brown Boveri, which jumped 65.75 rupees, or 8.76 percent, to 816.25 on Friday, is seen rising in anticipation of a liberal bonus issue when its board meets on October 17.</p>
