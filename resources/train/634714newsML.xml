<p>Anti-smoking lawmakers Tuesday unveiled legislation to clamp down on secondhand smoke and curtail cigarette sales to minors, warning tobacco firms they were in for a rough ride in Congress.</p>
<p>The lawmakers said the new measures were designed to send a clear signal to cigarette makers and state attorneys general as they continue tense negotiations aimed at settling a score of tobacco-related lawsuits.</p>
<p>Industry officials have indicated they may be willing to accept new federal controls as part of an overall settlement of state lawsuits seeking to recover Medicaid costs of tobacco-related illness. In return, the companies want concessions, including protection from future litigation.</p>
<p>Any broad settlement would have to be approved by Congress. Smoking opponents have made it clear they will not agree to a deal granting wide immunity. They also want public health protections similar to the bills announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;These bills make the settlement more specific. We don't want settlement at any cost. We want a settlement that's good for America. That's good for the public health of our nation,&quot; said Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.</p>
<p>New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg, saying the tobacco talks appeared to be stalled, warned Congress would not sign off on any immunity for cigarette makers. But he stopped short of promising to block any deal he did not like.</p>
<p>Later this week, a coalition of major health groups will convene in Washington to begin drafting public health guidelines they want included in any settlement. The effort will be led by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and former Food and Drug Administration head David Kessler.</p>
<p>One of the bills announced Tuesday would curtail smoking in public and private nonresidential buildings used regularly by more than 10 people. Building owners could either ban all smoking or restrict it to separately ventilated areas.</p>
<p>In addition, it would ban smoking on all domestic and international airline flights originating in the United States, no matter the carrier. Current law bars smoking on flights of six hours or less.</p>
<p>The second measure would require tobacco companies to reduce the number of children using their products by 90 percent over six years. Companies that did not comply would pay a fee of $1 per pack of cigarettes, pouch of tobacco or other product. The fee would rise each following year.</p>
<p>The lawmakers asked President Clinton to ban smoking in federal buildings. California Democratic Representative Henry Waxman, a longtime tobacco foe, will introduce the bills in the House.</p>
<p>Lawmakers admitted the bills face a tough battle. Since they are not likely to be approved by any committee, they may try to offer them as amendments to other legislation.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry has been sued by 29 attorneys general seeking to recoup Medicaid costs of smokers. Negotiations have been pressured by the fact that Mississippi is scheduled to bring the first of those cases to trial on July 7.</p>
