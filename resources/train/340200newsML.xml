<title>UK: IPE Brent gains on technicals, U.S. heating oil.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent gains on technicals, U.S. heating oil.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures were stronger on Wednesday, underpinned by good technical support, and amid a perception that latest heating oil stocks data from key U.S. market were more bullish than had been anticipated.</p>
<p>March Brent was trading at $22.68 a barrel at 1526 GMT, 43 cents up. February gas oil was $2.75 a tonne up at $203.25.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got to look at (NYMEX) heating oil and that is leading the way,&quot; one IPE floor trader said.</p>
<p>Latest data from the Americal Patroleum Institute (API) showed a weekly draw in U.S. heating oil inventories of 2.85 million barrels, slightly more than had been expected.  </p>
<p>Traders said that March Brent's failure to break lower through the psychological level of $22.00 a barrel had encouraged the bulls.</p>
<p>This extra confidence, according to one trader, had led to covering of some short positions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our perception is that there are still a few shorts in the market and this is being seen as an opportunity to neutralise the market a little.&quot;</p>
<p>A forecast of below-normal temperatures in the key heating oil markets in the northeastern U.S. was giving the market an added boost, he added.</p>
