<p>Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer slammed critics of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) huge gold sale, saying on Friday speculators were responsible for the gold price slump, not the government or the RBA.</p>
<p>Fischer said &quot;24 year-old screen jockeys with braces&quot; in the world's financial markets had to accept more of the responsibility.  </p>
<p>&quot;If they've got to close out or hedge with pain the speculative positions they've taken, I'm not going to shed one tear for them,&quot; Fischer told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio in South Africa.</p>
<p>The gold price was set by traders around world, and it was unfair to blame Canberra, he said.</p>
<p>World gold prices slumped to 12-year lows after the RBA announced last week it had sold two thirds of its reserves.</p>
<p>The RBA, which reduced its holdings from 247 tonnes to 80 tonnes over the last six months, said it would invest the proceeds from the sale in foreign currency assets like bonds.  </p>
<p>Earlier in a newspaper interview published on Friday, RBA governor Ian Macfarlane defended the bank's gold sales and said miners had exaggerated the price impact of the RBA sale and helped to undermine the price through big forward selling.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (miners) somewhat exaggerate our impact on the overall world market,&quot; the paper quoted Macfarlane as saying.</p>
<p>He said the gold price had been heavily influenced over the past year by European central bank sales and by proposals by the International Monetary Fund to sell gold to fund debt relief.  </p>
<p>He also cited a research paper from the U.S. Federal Reserve which proposed the U.S. central bank sell down its gold reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;Heavy forward selling by producers has not helped either,&quot; the RBA governor added.</p>
