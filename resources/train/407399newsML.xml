<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto joined in international criticism of Israel on Thursday, saying the decision to build homes for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem was a &quot;negative element&quot; to the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision acts as a negative element for the Middle East peace process and I personally regret it,&quot; a Japanese government official quoted Hashimoto as telling visting Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister David Levy.</p>
<p>Israel's decision on Wednesday to approve the building of thousands of new Jewish homes in East Jerusalem sparked criticism from its key ally the United States and Palestinian warnings that it could unleash bloodshed.</p>
<p>Hashimoto said that Japan was willing to play its part in promoting peace in the region and urged Israel to persevere.</p>
<p>Levy was in Tokyo on a five-day visit from Wednesday to meet Japanese government and business leaders.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda echoed Hashimoto's concern in a separate meeting with Levy, saying Wednesday's decision was going to cast a shadow on the positive atmosphere which had been growing between the rival forces since the peace agreement.</p>
<p>Levy defended his government's decision, describing the move as an attempt at co-existing with the Arabs.</p>
<p>The plan involved housing for both the Jews and the Arabs, and was &quot;a serious attempt at co-existing with the Arabs,&quot; a Japanese official quoted Levy as telling Ikeda.</p>
<p>Israel's ministerial committee on Jerusalem approved the construction of 6,500 homes for Jews, and another 3,000 housing units to be built for Arabs.</p>
<p>Palestinians have charged Israel was trying to pre-empt a decision on the final status of Jerusalem, which is supposed to be decided in future talks that must be completed by 1999.</p>
<p>The United States said the decision &quot;further complicates an already complicated situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu, mounting a defence of the plan, said on Thursday: &quot;We will not tolerate violence... If we're challenged violently we'll have to respond very firmly, but I hope it doesn't come to that.</p>
