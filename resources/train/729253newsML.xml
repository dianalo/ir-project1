<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen mostly steady, with a possible weak tone, following hefty hog sales early this week ahead of a heat wave seen lasting through Thursday, hog dealers and packer buyers said.</p>
<p>The hog marketings provided adequate supplies of hogs for packers' nearby needs, they said.</p>
<p>Some of the hogs coming to market on Tuesday were said to be advance marketings by farmers who did not want to sort and ship hogs amid the expected heat and humidity this week, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Meteorologists predicted high temperatures in the Midwest would range from the low- to high- 90 degrees Fahrenheit area through Thursday. The only rain in the forecast was for Friday and was not expected to be heavy or widespread.</p>
<p>The interior Iowa/southern Minnesota top price on hogs delivered to plants was seen at $61.50. Top Illinois prices at the plant were projected at $60.50 and Indiana/Ohio top hog values were seen at $61.00, sources in those areas said.</p>
<p>Any weakness that develops in the market was expected to be short lived, particularly if marketings tighten and pork product prices continue trending higher, market sources said.</p>
<p>Active marketings also were tied to farmers taking advantage of this week's higher prices, which likely encouraged them to sell hogs earlier than planned, they said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota top hog prices Tuesday closed at $61.50, up $0.50 to $1.00 from Monday and up $2.50 since Friday, USDA statistics showed.</p>
