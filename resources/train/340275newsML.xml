<p>A 209 shilling plunge in power monopoly Kenya Power &amp; Lighting dragged the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) 20-share index down 28.03 points on Wednesday to close at 3520.28, brokers said.</p>
<p>Turnover was posted at 65.425 million shillings on 1,396,366 shares from 25.553 million shillings on 425,837 shares.</p>
<p>Brokers at the Nairobi bourse said the dip was expected because the share was trading without dividend or bonus beginning today. The company had announced a dividend of eight shillings and a bonus of two shares for every one held.</p>
<p>The share closed at 90 but they predicted the price would go up on speculation of the company revaluing its assets which they thought would be confirmed at the anuual general meeting to be held on February 28.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is looking forward to further privatisation of the company now that it has announced that it will separate its power generation functions from distribution functions,&quot; a financial analyst from leading brokerage house Shah, Munge &amp; Partners said.</p>
<p>The special one-hour-hold board and three day offer board boosted turnover at the NSE. Some 459,000 shares of Firestone East Africa at 33 from 30 and 512,000 shares of Kenya Breweries at 55.50 from 52.50 were traded on the three day board. Foreigners dealt 50,000 shares of Kenya Power at 90 from 299.</p>
<p>In the financial sector heavy demand from both foreigners and local investors sustained the Kenya Commercial Bank's firm tone, trading at 90.50 from 89. There was some modest demand for Barclays Bank at 112 from 110, and Standard Chartered Bank at 53.50 from 52.</p>
<p>Investors, especially foreign investors, have been buying Kenya Commercial Bank heavily in the belief that the price is undervalued. During its public share offer in October last year the share went for 50 while its net asset value was put at 57.</p>
<p>The race, brokers predicted, will be between Barclays Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank and Standard Chartered. Bourse officials said that going by history, Barclays might be the first to announce.</p>
<p>Express Kenya traded at 76 from 85.50, while Uchumi closed at 40 unchanged, trading without bonus.</p>
<p>Sasini Tea &amp; Coffee was unchanged at 75, while Rea Vipingo traded at 10.10 from 11.30.</p>
