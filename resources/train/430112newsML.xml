<p>A Norwegian employee of Swedish construction group Skanska AB has been kidnapped by suspected Marxist rebels in northwest Colombia, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Stein Vatne, 46, is a foreman at Skanska's hydroelectric power project in Urra in northwest Cordoba province. He left Urra by plane on Feb. 20, according to a company spokesman in Stockholm, and was reported to have travelled from provincial capital Monteria by car on his way to see his family in Ecuador.</p>
<p>Police said a car was found abandoned on Feb. 21 on a stretch of road between Taraza and Valdivia, in neighbouring Antioquia province. Vatne's employers raised the alarm at the end of February when Vatne, who has lived and worked in Latin America since 1986, failed to show up in Ecuador or return to Urra.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said subsequent investigations showed Vatne had been dragged from his vehicle at a roadblock set up by Revolutionary Armred Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels. Two engineers working for Skanska were kidnapped in December 1994 on their way to work and were released unharmed after six months.</p>
<p>Last year there were more than 1,300 reported kidnappings in Colombia -- the highest rate of abductions anywhere in the world. About half were attributed to guerrillas who seek to fill their war chests with ransom payments and the proceeds of extortion.</p>
