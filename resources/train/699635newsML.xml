<headline>FOCUS-European bourses rebound on stronger dollar.</headline>

<p>European bourses bounced back strongly on Tuesday, with Paris hitting a trading high, feeding in part off a stronger dollar which held out the prospects of cheaper exports.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency itself raced to 40-month peaks against the mark, driven by American figures showing strong economic growth and a growing belief that the European single currency would be turn out to be soft.</p>
<p>The surpise rally in European stocks was driven by domestic factors as well as the dollar and came despite a negative close on Wall Street overnight which ended the market's strongest quarter in more than a decade.</p>
<p>The biggest leap came in Paris where shares climbed 2.25 percent to 2,925.53 points on the CAC-40 blue chip index, eclipsing the previous intra-day high of 2,903.18 set last Friday.</p>
<p>The rebound from Monday's losses of 1.1 percent was powered by the robust dollar and technical factors linked to the expiry of share options contract on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>London shook off nerves before Wednesday's British budget and chalked up gains of 1.26 percent amid renewed bid speculation and buying interest in the futures market.</p>
<p>More bid speculation about NatWest Bank played a part, dragging the banking sector sharply up. NatWest shares were up 27-1/2p to 835p after hitting 855p.</p>
<p>&quot;The futures took the market to these dizzying heights without a doubt,&quot; said one senior trader. &quot;And the bank sector is very much involved, particularly NatWest.&quot;</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, the IBIS index of electronic trade climbed by 1.25 percent as the stronger dollar helped to lift the market from Monday's losses.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a good potential for the market to keep up this recovery,&quot; said one Frankfurt trader, noting that the dollar was trading above 1.74 marks in European dealings.</p>
<p>Chemical and carmaker shares, which benefit from the weak mark helping exports, were leading the advance. Hoechst AG, Bayer AG and BASF AG were all higher on news that broker CSFB had upgraded Hoechst to buy from hold.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar hit 1.7465 marks in early trade before easing back slightly, compared with 1.7432 marks at the European close on Monday. It was also up about half a yen.</p>
<p>The dollar was benefiting from its safe haven status amid renewed uncertainty about the strength of the euro after a big split within Germany's ruling coalition over terms of entry for the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again the soft euro argument has gained the upper hand,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank, adding the dollar was also supported by U.S. data on Monday signalling growth could be picking up again after several months of slowing.</p>
<p>Analysts also expect healthy signals on the U.S. economy to come from Tuesday's National Association of Purchasing Management survey, due a 1400 GMT, which will be good news for the dollar.</p>
<p>The market will be keeping a close watch on the U.S. central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which starts at 1300 GMT. No announcement is expected before Wednesday but economists surveyed in a Reuters poll were unanimous in predicting no change in rates</p>
<p>In bullion markets, gold was fixed at $333.60 an ounce, its lowest since March 30, 1993. Traders saw support if the price fell below $332.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1115 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 114.99 yen and 1.7454 marks, compared with 114.54 and 1.7432 in late European trade on Monday.</p>
