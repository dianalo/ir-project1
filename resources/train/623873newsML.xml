<headline>Reliance leads rally in Bombay blue chips.</headline>
<dateline>BOMBAY 1997-05-29</dateline>

<p>Bombay blue chips staged a smart rally on Thursday, with action focussed on market-favourite Reliance Industries after fund buying drove the stock nearly five percent higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Shares of Reliance Industries gained 13.25 rupees, or 4.7 percent, to 296.25 -- the day's high with 7.04 million shares traded at the Bombay exchange.</p>
<p>The stock ended 13.05 rupees higher at 296.0 on the National Stock Exchange in volumes of over 18.11 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been renewed fund buying in many blue chips,&quot; said Kirti Doshi, dealer at Biyani Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Reliance was the main mover.&quot;</p>
<p>Bombay's top 30-share index closed 38.0 points, or 1.03 percent, higher at a provisional 3,723.31, above 3,659.39 -- intra-day high.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has rallied at a time when everyone was taking a pessimistic view,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign brokerage. &quot;Funds are keen bidders in their universe of stocks -- multinational, refinery and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>
<p>Announcement of poor company results led shares to a weak start on Thursday, but strong bidding by foreign funds reversed the sagging market trend, traders said.</p>
<p>Shares of Colgate-Palmolive (India) ended 2.75 rupees down at 279.50 after the firm said on Wednesday its 1996/97 net rose marginally to 780.3 million rupees, from 775.8 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Engineering firm Larsen &amp; Toubro rose 2.50 rupees to 206.25 ahead of its 1996/97 (April-March) results due later on Thursday, market participants said.</p>
<p>Larsen said its financial results are expected to be announced by around 5:30 p.m. (1200 GMT) after a meeting of its board of directors.</p>
<p>In a snap poll ahead of the firm's results, analysts from leading securities houses forecast an average net profit of 4,326.50 million rupees, up from 3,886.90 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>Net profit forecasts ranged from a low of 4,186 million rupees to 4,530 million.</p>
