<title>USA: Soybean, coffee prices close lower, crude oil firm.</title>

<p>Soybean prices closed lower on Thursday as rumors swirled about imports of Brazilian soybeans into the United States, the world's largest soybean producer.</p>
<p>Soybeans, which hit an 8-1/2 year high earlier this week at the Chicago Board of Trade amid booming demand from domestic processors, on Wednesday had fallen nearly the 30 cent per bushel limit when a trading house, Glencore, said it had sold 45,000 metric tons of soybeans to a U.S. buyer.</p>
<p>On Thursday March soybeans closed another 1-1/2 cents a bushel lower at $8.21, after trading as low as $8.12.</p>
<p>After the close of trading Thursday, a small Kentucky processor, Owensboro Grain Co, confirmed that it had bought 150,000 tons of &quot;optional origin&quot; soybeans this week -- meaning the beans could come from the United States or from other producers including Brazil, Argentina or Paraguay.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is still showing a negative tone left from yesterday's heavy break,&quot; said Jason Roose, analyst with U.S. Commodities. &quot;South American prices are a lot cheaper and we're coming into harvest. At these high levels, are we going to be competitive?&quot;</p>
<p>Soybeans are processed or &quot;crushed&quot; to produce soymeal, a high-protein livestock feed, and soyoil, widely used in food and industrial products. The U.S. Agriculture Department on March 11 estimated that U.S. processors would crush a record 1.42 billion bushels in the year to September 1 on booming demand.</p>
<p>March corn futures closed up 3 cents a bushel at $3.00-3/4 after the Agriculture Department reported higher than expected export sales of 1.009 million tons in the week to March 6.</p>
<p>Traders had expected sales of 700,000 to 800,000 tons and the news calmed some fears that China, which has registered large recent sales to South Korea, may hurt U.S. exports.</p>
<p>&quot;It's coming back and the export sales were good,&quot; said analyst Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee prices fell sharply on an easing in supply concerns.</p>
<p>May coffee closed down 13.85 cents per pound at 182.25 cents, a drop of seven percent on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals are slowly changing,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walter Spilka. &quot;Higher prices for coffee will bring more coffee into the market. Colombia is selling old-crop coffee to make money. Brazil is selling old-crop coffee to make money.&quot;</p>
<p>He pointed to a report from the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters saying Brazilian coffee exports so far this year have reached 2.33 million 132-pound bags, nearly twice the 1.18 million bags shipped in the first two months of 1996.</p>
<p>Since early December, coffee futures prices have nearly doubled as worries about low stock levels in both consuming and producing nations, coupled with projections for smaller crops in many Latin American countries, fueled supply woes.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil prices rose on indications that imports from Europe would slow.</p>
<p>April crude oil ended at $20.70 a barrel, up 8 cents.</p>
<p>North Sea loadings of Britain's benchmark Brent crude oil were scheduled to slow down in April, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Brent loading program assisted us here as the strength in London was carried over to the NYMEX,&quot; said Prudential Securities oil market analyst Richard Redash.</p>
<p>In refined products, a cold snap expected to hit the northeastern United States early next week boosted heating oil prices. April heating oil ended 0.14 cent per gallon higher at 54.22 cents, while April gasoline closed 0.40 cent per gallon lower at 64.23 cents.</p>
