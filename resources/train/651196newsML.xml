<headline>Belgian Post Office in the red, sees more losses.</headline>

<p>Belgium's Post Office, one of the country's largest employers, lost 741 million Belgian francs in 1996 and forecast another two years of losses.</p>
<p>A profit of 342 million francs in 1995 was wiped out as the government withdrew two billion francs of subsidies as part of efforts to turn the Post Office into an autonomous state company along the lines of state railways SNCB/NMBS and partly state-owned telecoms group Belgacom.</p>
<p>Last year's results were also hit by additions to reserves for the early retirement of staff. The Post office gave no figures for the provisions, noting only that total costs stood at 66.33 billion francs in 1996.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andre Bastien told a news conference the Post Office was overstaffed and needed to cut salary costs to become competitive ahead of the January 1, 2003 liberalisation of cross-border mail services.</p>
<p>Bastien said negotiations with unions about staff cuts had already started. The Post Office employed 46,935 in 1996, up from 46,597 in 1995.</p>
<p>The Post Office was in talks with companies in various European countries about dealing with the liberalisation of the parcel delivery sector and competition from groups such as DHL.</p>
<p>The company was focussing investment on information technology and security rather than setting up new offices. Real estate investment had been blocked for two years.</p>
<p>Spending on security centred on its 6,600 offices and on money delivery vans. Raids on such vans, not only Post Office ones, have dropped off after the government this year imposed new measures on safety including mandatory police protection.</p>
<p>Bastien said the Post Office was struggling to find a solution for attacks on its postmen -- at record levels in 1996 -- and the resulting high level of absenteeism.</p>
<p>Belgian postmen often carry large sums of cash or cheques since social security beneficiaries receive payments in the mail rather than directly into their bank accounts.</p>
<p>Bastien said results at the Post Office's banking and insurance operations had been as expected, but gave no details. Post Office Insurance had been operational for less than a year. News on banking was due in a few months' time.</p>
