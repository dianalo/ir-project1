<p>South African President Nelson Mandela said on Friday that his country would play a role in peace talks next week between Zairean rebels and embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko, but within U.N. initiatives.</p>
<p>Mandela, responding to a question on South Africa's hosting of the talks, implicitly confirmed a South African government source who said earlier on Friday in Johannesburg that the two Zairean sides would meet in South Africa next week.</p>
<p>Mandela told a news conference in New Delhi on the second day of a three-day visit to India that South Africa played a role but only as an extension of Afrrican regional efforts and initiatives by United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in that context that the role of South Africa should be assessed,&quot; said. &quot;We must not exaggerate the role played by South Africa in that country.&quot;</p>
<p>The Johannesburg source, confirming rebel statements in Zaire earlier on Friday, told Reuters senior Foreign Ministry officials had started laying the groundwork for negotiations, which were likely to take place on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>Forces led by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) under Laurent Kabila have seized about one-quarter of Africa's third-biggest country. They insist that a ceasefire in the six-month civil war can only be declared after negotiations have begun.</p>
<p>&quot;If nothing changes, then the talks will be in South Africa and will begin either on Monday or Tuesday,&quot; Moise Nyarugabo, secretary-general at rebel headquarters, told Reuters in the eastern Zairean city of Goma.</p>
<p>Nyarugabo said the essential issue for the talks would be to negotiate the transfer of power from Mobutu to a transitional government led by the rebel alliance under Kabila.</p>
<p>&quot;The two parties (in Zaire) have come to South Africa and the deputy president (Thabo Mbeki) has done excellent work in bringing the two parties together,&quot; Mandela said.</p>
<p>He said his deputy played a key role in bringing the Kinshasa government and rebels to talk, but not entirely on its own. &quot;If you put it in that context, we acknowledge we have made a contribution,&quot; Mandela said.</p>
