<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan tightens rules on China investment.</title>
<headline>Taiwan tightens rules on China investment.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Taipei on Wednesday announced new restrictions on Taiwan's investments in rival China, including a US$50 million project cap, but vowed to drop the rules if Beijing renounces the right to retake the island by force.</p>
<p>&quot;At a time when cross-strait (Taiwan-China) relations are so tense, we do not wish to have overly large investments or public construction investments&quot; in the Chinese mainland, economics minister Wang Chih-kang told a news conference.  </p>
<p>&quot;But if the Chinese communists announce they are giving up the right to use military force to solve cross-strait problems, I myself believe the restrictions should be dropped,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, effective July 1, Taiwan firms are explicitly forbidden to invest in mainland infrastructure projects such as railways, roads and power plants -- throwing up a new obstacle to Formosa Plastics Group's planned US$3 billion mainland power station.</p>
<p>The ministry said it also had set a ceiling of US$50 million on single-project investments by Taiwan interests.</p>
<p>Total investments by any single firm listed in Taiwan's main or over-the-counter stock exchange would vary according its size but no single project could exceed the cap, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct investment and trade with China since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Since a political thaw began in the late 1980s, some 30,000 Taiwan firms have poured over US$30 billion into the mainland -- routing their investments through third countries. As a result, Taiwan has become one of China's top overseas investors and China one of Taiwan's most important markets.</p>
<p>Communist China regards Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel-held province that must be brought under mainland sovereignty, preferably through peaceful means but by force of arms if necessary.</p>
