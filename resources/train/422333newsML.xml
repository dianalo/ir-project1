<p>China said on Wednesday it had arrested several suspects and solved last week's bomb attacks on three buses in the far west region of Xinjiang that left nine people dead and 74 injured.</p>
<p>Suspects who planted the bombs and people who sold detonators used in the attacks have been arrested, the official Xinjiang Daily said in a front-page story.  </p>
<p>Police are interrogating the suspects and are still hunting for others still at large, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The newspaper called the bombing attacks a &quot;planned and coordinated act of destruction by a terrorist group&quot;.</p>
<p>Three bombs planted on buses blew up within minutes of each other in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, on February 25 in an apparently coordinated attack that coincided with funeral rites in Beijing for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Three people died on the spot, six died later in hospital and 74 people were injured, an official told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday.</p>
