<dateline>DALLAS</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kimberly-Clark Corp. on Monday reported slightly lower earnings for the second quarter, saying its results were hurt by the combination of Scott Paper Co.'s operations, which it acquired in 1995.</p>
<p>The company had net income of $363.5 million, or 65 cents per share, vs. $364.7 million, or 64 cents per share, in the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Sales fell 6.7 percent to $3.1 billion from $3.34 billion.</p>
<p>Following the news, Kimberly-Clark's stock lost $3.375 to $48.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The company said that, excluding the revenues from businesses sold last year to meet the regulatory requirements of its acquisition of Scott Paper, sales were down only 1 percent.</p>
<p>As part of Kimberly-Clark's $9.4 billion acquisition of Scott, which was completed in December 1995, the U.S. Justice Department required the company to sell off some assets.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating profit was adversely affected by strategic changes related to the combination of Kimberly-Clark's and Scott Paper Co.'s away-from-home businesses in North America,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Sales of personal care products rose 10.6 percent to $1.33 billion in the second quarter, but tissue sales dropped 15.1 percent to $1.63 billion and newsprint and paper sales plummeted 28.5 percent to $176.8 million.</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark said its personal care business should continue to perform well, particulary in North America and Latin America.</p>
