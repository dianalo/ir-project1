<p>Crude prices were firmer in Asia on Friday, with Abu Dhabi Umm Shaif and Dubai crude trading at firmer spot market premiums, traders said.</p>
<p>Umm Shaif switched hands between majors at ADNOC plus 14 cents, up sharply from the last deal at plus one cent.</p>
<p>Traders said values were pushed up because supplies are scarce compared to usual months due to a turnaround at the Umm Shaif field. They said supplies of Lower Zakum were also low, because of field maintenance.</p>
<p>Only one cargo of Lower Zakum remains in the market, traders said.  </p>
<p>May Dubai switched hands at front-month quotes plus 33/34 cents, up from the last deal levels of plus 28.5 cents, traders said. They said the cargo may have a specific loading date, which would explain the higher price.</p>
<p>In other Abu Dhabi grades, Murban traded twice at ADNOC flat on Wednesday, unchanged from the last deals, once between majors and a second time from a major to Kenya, traders said.</p>
<p>Market rumours held of a U.S. major planning to ship 900,000 barrels of Nigerian Pennington to Asia, possibly Japan.</p>
<p>Traders said the purchase would be economical given current Brent/Dubai spreads and weak Dated Brent prices.  </p>
<p>The U.S. major is believed to have plans to replace Abu Dhabi grades for Nigerian crudes, traders said.</p>
<p>In paper spreads, May Brent/Dubai was assessed at around $1.50/1.60, unchanged from overnight U.S. levels. May/June Dubai was assessed at about 22 cents, after trading at 20 cents on Thursday. May Cash Brent was assessed at $20.30/20.40, unchanged from midday Asian levels.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected end-users, who have been relatively relaxed this week, to become more active next week as refining programmes become clear.</p>
