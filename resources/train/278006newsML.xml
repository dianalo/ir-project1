<headline>CBOT soybeans end mixed, hit by wheat/corn slide.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-27</dateline>

<p>CBOT soybean futures closed mixed with a late break in wheat and corn pressing the market along with near-ideal crop weather in South America's soybean growing areas, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;When wheat and corn broke late it put pressure on the soy complex,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Soybeans were firm in early dealings on active exports of U.S. soybeans and soy products, the traders said.</p>
<p>USDA Friday said net export sales of U.S. soybeans during the week ended December 19 totaled 695,000 tonnes, near the top of trade estimates for 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The previous week, 707,800 tonnes of soybeans were reported sold which demonstrates the steady and active pace of export sales of soybeans.</p>
<p>But the market remains quiet and in a holiday mode with near-ideal crop weather in South America cited.</p>
<p>&quot;Weather in South America is ideal but I agree the bean number (export) is pretty good especially for a holiday week,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Soybeans closed one cent per bushel higher to 3/4 lower, with January down 1/4 at $7.01-1/2.  </p>
<p>Traders said the weekly National Oilseed Processor's Association crush report was neutral to mildly bearish. The soybean crush in the U.S. during the week ended December 25 was at 29.68 million bushels, slightly below expectations for 29.7 to 30.4 million bushels.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated at 20,000 contracts, below the 25,399 traded Thursday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>In soybean options, Cargill Investor Services bought 500 November $7.00 puts and sold 500 May $7.50 puts at five cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Soybean options volume was estimated at 6,000 contracts, above the 4,313 traded Thursday.</p>
