<title>NETHERLANDS: Upward pressure on Dutch money rates seen fading.</title>
<headline>Upward pressure on Dutch money rates seen fading.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-11-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch money rates edged up in an overall quiet market as Belgium, France and the U.S. closed on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said rates were slightly higher as traders started clearing their books near the end of the year, but said the rise in rates was likely to come to a halt.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dutch state has raised quite a lot of liquidity through its Dutch Treasury Certificates programmes and comparatively, needs little more,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The Dutch 1996 borrowing requirement was set at 39.1 billion guilders, of which 28.0 billion guilders has been raised through bond issues.</p>
<p>DTCs, the short-term borrowing programme, have added another 10.1 billion guilders, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;This could mean that the Dutch state only needs another one billion guilders in 1996,&quot; said one dealer. But other market participants said it could be slightly more.</p>
<p>&quot;Slowing demand from the state could lessen the upward pressure on Dutch deposits,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Call money rates were stable at a bid range between 2.62-68 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month deposits rose two basis points to 2.92 percent bid and six-month paper added four basis points to 3.02 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said some trades in three-month deposits were done at 3.02 percent. &quot;Japanese banks usually accept a higher rate,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The guilder was at 112.1375 per 100 marks from 112.175 on Friday.</p>
