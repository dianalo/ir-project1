<title>USA: Wilmington police face marchers calling for reform.</title>
<headline>Wilmington police face marchers calling for reform.</headline>
<dateline>WILMINGTON, Del. 1997-03-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>About 400 people marched on Wilmington police headquarters Sunday to demand reform after a week of racial tension that forced the city's first black police chief to step down.</p>
<p>The marchers, many singing hymns and holding palm fronds to mark Palm Sunday, called on officials to examine what they said was a pattern of excessive police force against minorities.</p>
<p>The charges sprang from a confrontation Tuesday in which the Rev. Lawrence Livingston, a black Methodist pastor, was arrested after a scuffle with white patrolman Kurtis Crawford.</p>
<p>Livingston, 39, was ticketed by Crawford for running a stop sign and a red light. In Crawford's affidavit, he said he was forced to unholster his gun, use pepper spray and his police baton after Livingston became aggressive.</p>
<p>The dispute led Wilmington's first black mayor, James Sills, to sack Chief Samuel Pratcher, a 25-year veteran and the first black to head the force, Friday after he refused to remove Crawford from active duty until an investigation into the incident was completed.</p>
<p>&quot;It was in the best interest of the officer and the community for him to be removed from street duty,&quot; Sills said Sunday.</p>
<p>A source close to the police said there had been anonymous telephone threats against Crawford, who has since been reassigned to administrative duty.</p>
<p>Although Livingston has not filed a complaint, claims of excessive force by a local church coalition and NAACP state president Keith Booker have triggered a federal investigation into possible civil rights violations and a renewed call by Mayor Sills for a police civilian review board.</p>
<p>Although about half of Wilmington's 73,000 residents are black, only about 36 percent of the police force come from minority groups.</p>
