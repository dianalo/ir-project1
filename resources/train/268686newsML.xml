<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures plunged 435 points by the close of Thursday's trade as a weak technical outlook reinforced overall bearish sentiment and triggered a fierce sell-off, dealers said.</p>
<p>Stop-loss sales were triggered on the move down causing the benchmark Nikkei 225 March contract to finish just 50 points above a year low of 19,600. Volume was a moderate 20,500 lots.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average fell 522.36 points to close at a low for the year of 19,570.67.  </p>
<p>&quot;It held above 19,950 till about 1:00 p.m. (0500 GMT). Then people came back from lunch and found the technical pattern confirmed a down move so they just sold it off,&quot; said a dealer with a local institution.</p>
<p>&quot;The move down was so fast that it took out the (previous year low) of 19,610 that we saw on the June contract,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said it would take a while for the market to bounce back as there was significant volume behind the drop.  </p>
<p>&quot;The first resistance is at 19,950 but that's 300 points away and it's going to be a tough climb,&quot; he said. &quot;Any kind of bounce will invite some selling because now (the trend) is no longer sideways to down. It's just down.&quot;</p>
<p>On the downside, a move below support at 19,550 could expose the March Nikkei to a potentially steep fall below 18,000.</p>
