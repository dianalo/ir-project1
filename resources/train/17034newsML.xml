<p>A formal ban on Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels, under consideration in Colombo, appears aimed at prodding the West to crack down on rebel activity, but analysts on Tuesday wondered how effective it could be.</p>
<p>The government has not outlawed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) because it wanted to leave open the option of resuming talks with the rebels to end the 13-year-old war in which the government says more than 50,000 people have died.</p>
<p>But Dharmalingam Siddharthan, head of the pro-government Democratic People's Liberation Front, said government ministers had asked his party for an opinion on outlawing the LTTE, which is fighting for a homeland in the north and east.</p>
<p>&quot;We said we don't see any benefit since the ground reality will remain the same whether they are banned or not,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;The government will also show that it is no longer interested in peace talks.&quot;</p>
<p>Government officials and ruling People's Alliance members of parliament said hardliners in the government and military were pushing for the ban hoping it would curb the rebels' international propaganda and funding.</p>
<p>Hardliners noted that Western governments had told Sri Lanka they could not crack down on rebel activities on their soil as long as the LTTE did not break their law and remained a legal organisation in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The LTTE has been described as a multinational corporation with offices in many Western capitals.</p>
<p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga summoned a special cabinet meeting to discuss banning the group last week but put off making a decision, government officials said.</p>
<p>Siddharthan, whose party promotes the interest of minority Tamils but in cooperation with the largely Sinhalese government, said a ban would have little impact on the LTTE's military strength or its overseas activities.</p>
<p>The Tigers were difficult to identify as they worked mainly through front organisations, he said.</p>
<p>Attorney-General Sarath Silva told Reuters the LTTE could be outlawed under 1978 legislation, which banned the group for one year, or under emergency regulations, but denied reports the government had consulted him on the matter.</p>
<p>The Tigers broke off peace talks in April last year, refusing to look at a government peace plan which offers Tamils extensive autonomy.</p>
<p>A British High Commission spokesman said he did not believe that banning the LTTE would result in Britain closing down the group's London office used as the rebels' propaganda base.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't been contacted by the Sri Lankan government about banning the LTTE,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;It is unlikely we could close down the LTTE's London office as long as they don't violate British law.&quot;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka was likely to raise the issue with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind when he visits the island for talks on Friday, he said.</p>
<p>The proposal to ban the LTTE comes as some Western governments take an increasingly critical view of the rebels.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department's coordinator for counter terrorism, Philip Wilcox, said last week Washington sympathised with the predicament that Colombo faced.</p>
<p>He promised that Washington would &quot;do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of American soil to perpetrate violence against&quot; the Sri Lankan government.</p>
