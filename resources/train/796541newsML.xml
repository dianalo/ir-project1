<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted on Wednesday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat crack down on Moslem militants before Israel eased sanctions on Palestinians.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, speaking after talks with King Hussein of Jordan, said he was ready to relax a closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as soon as Palestinians crushed &quot;terrorists&quot; behind the suicide bombers who killed 14 people in Jerusalem last month.</p>
<p>He pointedly described the Palestinians as &quot;partners&quot; and said Israeli moves, which prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from getting to work and blocked the transfer of millions of dollars of customs revenues, were &quot;not designed to encumber or discomfort the population&quot;.</p>
<p>But despite the placatory tone he gave no hint he would ease the sanctions unless Arafat acted first.</p>
<p>&quot;What we would like to see is the fulfilment of the commitment to battle the terrorists and as we see action, any action taken in that direction, we shall adjust and change our measures accordingly,&quot; Netanyahu told a joint news conference.</p>
<p>Netanyahu also said he was prepared to discuss with the Palestinians the fate of Jewish settlements in areas occupied by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war. Settlements is one of the most contentious issues in any final peace deal.</p>
<p>&quot;We can and we will discuss our differences, including on the issues of settlements, around the negotiating table...and hopefully come to a final settlement and end once and for all the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>King Hussein, who has questioned Netanyahu's commitment to peace, said the region was passing through dangerous times.</p>
<p>He said he hoped Netanyahu &quot;with his colleagues (will be able) to make their full contribution to peace through the cessation of one and all of acts which jeopardise peace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not expect that this meeting would resolve problems in a dramatic way. I conveyed my concerns, he conveyed his... and we both realise the danger of the moment,&quot; the king said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he had information that militants were planning more attacks in Israel.</p>
<p>Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said settlements were just one of several &quot;final status&quot; issues which Netanyahu's government was committed to discuss under the 1993 Oslo peace accords which granted Palestinians limited self-rule.</p>
<p>&quot;If this Israeli government is committed to Oslo agreements, it should have started final status talks which have not resumed since May last year,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Jordan summit coincided with a mission by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross to restore security cooperation between Israel and the PLO.</p>
<p>Ross has shuttled between Netanyahu and Arafat since Sunday, managing to bring Israeli and Palestinian security officials together for intelligence sharing.</p>
<p>But the Palestinian side links security cooperation with political progress in peacemaking and demands a halt to Israeli settlement building in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Ross said he believed Israel would ease its closure of the West Bank and Gaza once security cooperation resumed.</p>
<p>He was expected to meet again with Arafat and Netanyahu on Wednesday before heading home to prepare a possible first visit to the region by Albright later this month.</p>
<p>But Palestinians said U.S. mediation had been undermined by the temporary closure of the PLO's Washington office. The office's permit expired on Tuesday night after Congress failed to pass its annual foreign aid bill before summer recess.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a seriously wrong decision at this particular time when Ross is here trying to revive the peace process,&quot; senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.</p>
<p>Talks on expanding Palestinian self-rule set out in a 1993 interim peace accord with Israel have been been dormant since March when Netanyahu's government allowed construction to begin of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The twin suicide bombing plunged their already precarious ties deeper into crisis. Netanyahu accused Arafat of tacitly condoning militants who oppose the Israel-PLO peace moves.</p>
<p>Arafat has insisted he is making a &quot;100 percent effort&quot; on security and accuses Israel of using the bombing as a pretext to weaken his legitimacy.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Israeli workers tore down nine illegal Arab homes under construction in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope to establish as the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move that failed to win international recognition. Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to drive them out of Jerusalem.</p>
