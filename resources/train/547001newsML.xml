<p>Gov. William F. Weld's long list of priorities became much shorter this weekend when President Clinton tapped him to become ambassador to Mexico.</p>
<p>Instead of nearly two years to get through a laundry list that contained sizable undertakings such as convincing the Legislature to authorize an Indian casino in Southeastern Massachusetts, find funding to construct a new convention center in Boston, and continue supporting the education reform act, Weld's days are now measured in weeks and months.</p>
<p>Intending to remain in his post until confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Weld expects to vacate his office sometime this summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The one thing I would like to take the best shot at getting done before I leave is a balanced budget, which as you know is due July 1, and try to get some further tax relief for the citizens of Massachusetts,&quot; Weld said in his first meeting with State House reporters since accepting the State Department job.</p>
<p>&quot;The other area that is at the top of the plate right now is theimplementation of the education reform law, making sure that the tracking, the assessment, the testing, the accountability gets imported into that system,&quot; a smiling Weld said.</p>
<p>Education reform is fully funded in the budget that passed the House two weeks ago.  However, none of the seven tax cuts Weld included in his budget made it past the House's ax-wielders. The Senate will debate the budget next month, and it is expected to land on Weld's desk in June.</p>
<p>When Weld arrived on Beacon Hill Tuesday afternoon from Philadelphia, where he met with Clinton, he learned that the Legislature will likely reject his bid to allow a casino to be built in Fall River, where the Wampanoag Tribe had hoped to build one.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm probably the biggest supporter of the compact which we negotiated with the Wampanoags,&quot; he said.  &quot;I believed in it from the beginning and I thought we made adjustments to try to effectuate a political calibration that would help its chances going through the Legislature.&quot;</p>
<p>Now any bills expanding gaming in the commonwealth will likely have to be supported by Lt. Gov. Paul Cellucci, who will become acting governor if  Weld, as expected, is approved for the ambassadorship.</p>
<p>As he has for most of the past seven years, Weld insisted there is little difference philosophically between him and Cellucci.</p>
<p>Although he had contemplated running for a third term before receiving Clinton's offer, Weld predicted that Cellucci will be a strong candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not prepared to say that I would necessarily be a better candidate next year than Paul Cellucci,&quot; he said. &quot;He'll be taking  a fresh shot at it and bringing a lot of vigor to the race, and I think he can run a heck of a race.  He can make the same arguments I can make.&quot;</p>
<p>Weld said that he expects some people who have contributed to him anticipating a third term to be disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect there would be some disappointment there,&quot; Weld said.  He added later, &quot;Any contributor who wants their money back, we'll give them their money back.&quot;</p>
