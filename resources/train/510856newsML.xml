<p>The consolidation of Britain's securities industry continues apace, according to a survey published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 1997 Reuters survey of UK larger company investment research, sales and trading, compiled by Tempest Consultants, said the relatively small numbers of fund managers, analysts and salespeople voted for indicated &quot;growing concentration within the industry&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Viewed from all three corners of the equity triangle, growing concentration through corporate activity is the natural consequence of the relentless pressure,&quot; the survey said.</p>
<p>It said this pressure stemmed from expansion plans at both securities houses and fund management groups, higher market levels and greater revenues and profits.</p>
<p>The largest companies were becoming more dominant as a result of globalisation, deregulation and a drive for shareholder value. This in turn is leading to the further growth of sector coverage by &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;sell&quot; side research departments.</p>
<p>It was also resulting in the exploitation of global investment banking opportunities bu the most focused and integrated firms.</p>
<p>An increasing concentration of British equity funds resulted from competition and an increased focus on costs, process and performance as well as further outsourcing of in-house company pension funds and mergers and aquisitions arising from bank and insurance company competition.</p>
<p>These factors are leading to a migration of funds to the best performers and have already resulted in the absorption of eight significant fund management groups during 1996/97, with more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>They have also led to larger funds being managed by fewer managers, the survey said.</p>
<p>The survey also stated that there are too many analysts following too many companies, too many brokers selling to fewer fund management groups and merger activity arising from competition and a need for more capital adequacy.</p>
<p>This increasing concentration of brokers' analysts meant the securities industry was shouldering high costs, there was increasing discrimination between winners and losers and a shakeout is on the cards when the market turns.</p>
<p>Other themes highlighted included a strong increase in demand for on-line research.</p>
<p>It also found serious gaps were developing between what fund managers wanted and what they actually got and this was leading fund management groups to use fewer brokers and increase their own in-house research.</p>
<p>Fund management groups were making greater use of in-house crossed dealing and programme trading and the proportion of British equity trading which bears commission has dropped, the survey found.</p>
<p>And while dealers at fund management groups are warming to the prospect of an order driven system, they still think liquidity and speed of execution will suffer.</p>
<p>Another theme to have emerged from the survey is that finance directors of the quoted companies were increasing their direct contact with fund managers and prefer one-to-one meetings with fund managers and brokers' analysts rather than group meetings, identifying with individuals rather than teams.</p>
