<p>A sickly Pete Sampras saw his French Open hopes laid to rest for another year on Friday as the world number one joined ex-champion Thomas Muster on the well-trodden seeded path out of Roland Garros.</p>
<p>Sampras, in sparkling form in his opening two rounds at the only grand slam event he has never won, was weakened by a pre-match stomach upset as he went down in four sets to Swedish birthday boy Magnus Norman.</p>
<p>Muster's eventful tournament also ended abruptly on Friday when he was hustled out by little-known Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, ranked one place below Norman at 66 in the world.</p>
<p>Half of the top 10 men's seeds have now failed to make it beyond the third round but not surprisingly it was Sampras's exit which created the biggest stir, despite his relative lack of success on clay.</p>
<p>There had been signs the 25-year-old American, with nine Grand Slam titles already in the bag, was getting to grips with the surface and his determination &quot;to do anything it takes&quot; to win at Roland Garros made him a serious contender this year.</p>
<p>But even champions need a little luck and his clear discomfort beneath a hot sun was all the encouragement Norman needed to come of age in Grand Slam tennis on his 21st birthday.</p>
<p>He finally triumphed 6-2 6-4 2-6 6-4 in two and a half hours, converting the first of three match points to end a potential Sampras comeback from the wasteland of two sets down.</p>
<p>Muster, champion in 1995 and seeded fifth this time, might have imagined he was in for a quieter time after a searching five-set examination in the first round against Germany's Marc Kevin Goellner and a bad-tempered clash with American Jeff Tarango on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Instead he was beaten 6-7 6-1 6-3 3-6 6-4 by a player he last encountered in a notoriously acrimonious Davis Cup contest between Austria and Brazil in Sao Paulo last September.</p>
<p>Kuerten was one of the players on the other side of the net when Muster stormed off court during the doubles rubber complaining he had been spat on and abused by the crowd, a walkout which led to Austria being fined by the International Tennis Federation.</p>
<p>On neutral ground, however, the Austrian could not escape an opponent whose athletic display suggested he may have a promising future at the top level.</p>
<p>Dressed in a bright yellow shirt, blue shorts and blue shoes, the 20-year-old from Florianopolis was often a blur of colour as he dashed around court one and for once Muster's legendary fitness and determination were not enough to save him, even when he led 3-0 in the final set.</p>
<p>&quot;He definitely has a cracking forehand and took advantage of my shorter balls. It was a good win for him,&quot; said Muster.</p>
<p>&quot;Losing today was very disappointing because I had a good draw and a good chance to go far in this tournament. I had my chances here and didn't take them, especially in the fifth set.&quot;</p>
<p>In the women's singles, Steffi Graf was forced into only her third tie-break in the early rounds at Roland Garros for a decade by Spain's Magui Serna but still progressed 7-6 6-1.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not at 100 percent yet but every day I go out there I'm feeling better,&quot; said Graf, out of the game for much of this year with a knee injury. &quot;I'm moving around the court a lot better, but the stability in my game is missing.&quot;</p>
<p>Karina Habsudova of Slovakia became only the second women's seed to fall when she lost 6-3 6-2 to Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir.</p>
