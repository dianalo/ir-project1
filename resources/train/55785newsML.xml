<title>USA: Dole closing in on Clinton in ABC News poll.</title>
<headline>Dole closing in on Clinton in ABC News poll.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-16</dateline>

<p>Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole has jumped to within eight percentage points of President Clinton in an ABC News poll released Monday, the closest that poll had been in three weeks.</p>
<p>A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll that also was released Monday showed Clinton with a 17 percentage point lead over Dole.</p>
<p>The ABC national survey of 623 &quot;likely voters&quot; taken from Wednesday to Sunday put Clinton at 49 percent, Dole at 41 percent and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot at 5 percent. There was a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Just a week ago, the same poll showed Clinton up by 15 percentage points, 53 to 38 percent, with Perot at 5 percent.</p>
<p>A larger ABC News sample of 735 registered voters in the poll released Monday found Clinton leading by 12 percentage points, 50 to 38 percent, with Perot trailing at 7 percent.</p>
<p>ABC said Dole's eight-point margin was still &quot;a large gap&quot; although the Republican cut Clinton's lead nearly one half in a week.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Republican convention in San Diego, an Aug. 18 ABC News had Dole within one percentage point of Clinton, 44 to 43 percent with Perot at 9 percent.</p>
<p>The CNN/USA Today tracking poll released Monday put Clinton 17 percentage points ahead of Dole, 51 to 34 percent, with Perot at 8 percent among 700 likely voters. Seven percent of those polled were undecided.</p>
<p>Perot's 8 percent showing was his highest in the continuing CNN/USA Today series. He has moved up three percentage points since a Sept. 9-11 poll.</p>
<p>The new poll, with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points, was taken Sept. 12-14.</p>
<p>Clinton's margin in the latest survey was up one point over Dole from the last poll, Sept. 11-13, that had Clinton at 51 to Dole's 35 percent. In that survey, Perot had 7 percent.</p>
<p>In a related development, a Media Studies Centre research paper said pollsters may be underestimating Perot's strength since in 1992 polls consistently measured his support five percentage points lower than his actual election percentage of 19 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Perot is a pollster's nightmare,&quot; the study said, arguing that pollsters use techniques often ill-equipped to measure a third party challenge. The Media Studies Centre is affiliated with the Freedom Forum nonpartisan foundation dealing with free press and free speech.</p>
