<headline>Gold static amid May Day holidays, awaits New York.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold was markedly quiet at easier levels on Thursday with most of Europe was shut for May Day holidays, but dealers expected some thrills from New York.</p>
<p>Precious metals saw some lending into platinum that eased tight liquidity conditions, while silver shared gold's lethargy.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed a touch easier at $339.55 an ounce, while spot gold was quoted at $339.60/$339.90, down 70 cents.</p>
<p>Feelings toward gold remained overwhelmingly bearish with fears of future central bank sales keeping bullion's prospects strictly capped under $350.00, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar, rushing to multi-year highs, added to the pressure.</p>
<p>But dealers said the market could manage to glean some support and crawl back above $340.00 following Wednesday's blip to $341.25, which was subsequently negated at the close.</p>
<p>&quot;It bounced from the $338-$339 level every time it got there. I think it might be edging its way back above $340 today,&quot; said one London dealer.</p>
<p>Strong U.S. GDP, pointing to an inflation pick-up, jolted Comex gold futures out of their listless mood, but only briefly, after Tuesday's benign U.S. figures favoured bonds instead.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being we are stuck in the $336-$341 range,&quot; said gold dealer Morris Emmanuel at Swiss-based Socofinance.</p>
<p>The market will be searching for new clues on the likelihood of U.S. rate hikes from Friday's key non-farm payrolls.</p>
<p>Most technical analysts maintain a bearish stance on gold while a downtrend line extending from $363.95 remained in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially place (support) at $338.50, which if breached would suggest a target of $330,&quot; said analyst Martin Squires of brokers Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>On the upside, resistance was heavy at $342.50. In the unlikely event of a rally beyond that point, gold would be faced with the rock-solid barrier of $345.00, analysts said.</p>
<p>Platinum forward rates softened early with one-month leasing quoted at eight percent from 9-10 previously.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody has lent the metal out,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>But last month's activity on protracted delays in Russian supplies was receding.</p>
<p>&quot;The market seems to have lost its way a little bit. These stories are getting a bit stale after a while,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>Spot platinum was quoted 40 cents higher at $372.00/$373.00, while palladium shed $1.00 to $155.25/$156.25.</p>
<p>Silver stood three cents down at $4.67/$4.69 and its potential gains were seen limited to $4.73 for now.</p>
