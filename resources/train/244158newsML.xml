<p>European bourses, which began sharply higher having decided &quot;grey Friday's&quot; global turmoil was an overreaction, were further encouraged on Monday by a stronger start on Wall Street.</p>
<p>And in foreign exchange trading, the dollar strengthened nearly a pfennig, taking it well above the 1.55 mark level. Analysts said the European currency focus had switched from the shaky U.S. stock and bonds markets of last week to intensifying negotiations over European monetary union.</p>
<p>London, Paris and Frankfurt, which all began more than one percent up before marking time awaiting Wall Street, received a boost when the Dow Jones Industrial Average began bullishly and gained more than half percent shortly after Wall Street opened for business.</p>
<p>Shares plunged in a worldwide selloff on Friday, badly shaken by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warning about &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in asset markets. The dollar and bonds were also dragged down.</p>
<p>However, on Monday, a raft of senior finance officials sought to calm market nerves jangled by Greenspan's comments.</p>
<p>Early on Bank of England governor Eddie George described the market response to his speech as an overreaction and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Greenspan was merely raising a question about stock market levels.</p>
<p>Then, in Basle, Switzerland, the world's leading central bankers also dismissed the financial markets' plunge last week as excessive.</p>
<p>The Group of 10 (G10) central bankers suggested Greenspan had only raised the question of whether &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; had pushed stock prices higher, not declared that it had.</p>
<p>London's blue chip FTSE 100 index bounced back to the day's highs around 40 points up, despite jitters about talk of an early election following the latest outbreak of tensions in the ruling Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The FTSE had ended Friday 88.2 points off at 3,963.0 -- its biggest one-day loss in percentage terms since February 1994.</p>
<p>Anglo-Austrian diversified manufacturer BTR rose on positive comment after its trading statement and B.A.T industries rose amid fresh merger talk.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt German shares extended morning gains of almost 2.5 percent gains in afternoon electronic dealings as sentiment was buoyed by the firmer Dow and stronger dollar, which makes German exports more attractive.</p>
<p>In floor trading the 30-share DAX index of bourse activity closed up 65.28 at 2,857.24. The IBIS DAX index on post bourse electronic trading was up 33.51 points at 2,866.04.</p>
<p>A centre of attention was Volkswagen, which jumped on news that VW chief Ferdinand Piech was going to convey regrets to U.S. auto giant GM over the industrial espionage row between the two companies.</p>
<p>It was a similar story in Paris, where shares regained their early sharp gains on the back of Wall Street. Though Paris was nearly one percent up, it had still only recouped part of Friday's 2.26 percent slide</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery is limited, which shows that the market remains fragile,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>On the currency front, the dollar too was at the session highs having rallied against the German mark as global stock and bond markets recovered their poise and traders looked to a week full of high-level European Union (EU) meetings.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac were meeting in Nuremberg ahead of the Dublin European Union summit next weekend, but even before the meeting Franco-German tensions were apparent.</p>
<p>Senior officials from Paris and Bonn made statements defending their divergent views on how to set up a &quot;stability pact&quot; to defend the planned currency, the euro.</p>
<p>And a delegation source said Monday afternoon that the two sides had made little progress in resolving their differences over a the pact, seen as vital to ensuring fiscal discipline within European monetary union.</p>
<p>By 1530 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.5549 marks compared with 1.5465 late on Friday. Against the yen, it was at 113.46 compared with 112.95 late last week.</p>
<p>While analysts and officials said the reaction to Greenspan's comments was exaggerated by year-end profit-taking, British analysts said the risks of a rate rise at the Fed's policy-making meeting on December 17 had risen, and that was boosting the dollar.</p>
<p>The dollar should further gain support from talk of a further trimming of the key German securities repurchase rate and a pan-European desire for a stronger dollar against European currencies, they said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 113.46 yen and 1.5549 marks against 112.95 yen and 1.5465 marks in late Europe on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares were 36.4 points higher at 3,999.6.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 20.03 at 2,260.75.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 65.28 at 2,857.24.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $369.00 compared with its Friday close of $369.65 ounce. Silver was also easier at $4.81.</p>
