<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shares end higher on good sentiment.</title>
<headline>Israeli shares end higher on good sentiment.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli shares closed higher on Thursday in active trading as the market maintained its bullish mood, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 1.11 percent, or 2.27 points, to 206.21 on all-share turnover of 96 million shekels against 102 million shekels on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index gained 0.86 percent to 216.41.</p>
<p>&quot;The mood in the market is very positive. Share prices continue to rise, but there is no logical explanation. Even the rise of the shekel against the dollar could not spoil the party,&quot; said Doron Tsur, head of research at Sahar Securities.</p>
<p>In the local foreign currency market, the representative rate for the dollar was fixed on Thursday at 3.2770 shekels against 3.2900 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;December is usually a good month for the market. Activity is strong and investors feel that we are in the middle of a bullish period. Market sentiment is positive, although this could change very quickly,&quot; Tsur added.</p>
<p>&quot;The market continues to show strength and new money is coming in,&quot; said Ronen Kaufman at Nesuah Trading and Investment. &quot;The most active players are local investors while foreign investors are sitting on the fence.&quot;</p>
<p>The main gainers, like on Wednesday, were the small- and medium-capitalization stocks, Kaufman added.</p>
<p>Elbit Medical Imaging surged the maximum 10 percent to 1,376 after its Nasdaq-traded share jumped 16.7 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Koor Industries, which gained 0.5 percent to 28,088 on volume of 8.7 million shekels; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which fell 0.25 percent to 154,904 on turnover of 7.6 million shekels; and Bank Leumi, which gained 0.25 percent to 435 on volume of 2.8 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.28 shekels)</p>
