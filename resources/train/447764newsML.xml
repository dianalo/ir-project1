<p>Koll Arcadia Investors and Colony Capital Inc said Monday they had proposed to recapitalize the Santa Anita Cos, a real estate investment trust.</p>
<p>Koll and Colony said they would provide up to $27 in cash to shareholders of Santa Anita, which is based in Arcadia, California.  </p>
<p>Koll, an investment partnership composed of principals of the Koll Cos and equity fund Apollo Real Estate Investors II LP, had made a previous recapitalization offer.</p>
<p>It and Colony, which joined Koll in its revised proposal, said they would contribute an aggregate of $116.5 million in new equity capital and have Santa Anita distribute a special dividend of $11 per share to shareholders from the proceeds of new financing.  </p>
<p>They said they would use about $61.5 million of the amount to fund a self-tender for 5.6 million SAR shares in which existing shareholders would be given the option to receive $16 in cash (in addition to the $11 per share special dividend) for each share acquired in the tender, or $11 in cash plus a warrant valued at $5.</p>
<p>Investment fund Gotham Partners LP will act as a stand-by purchaser to acquire warrants from the companies for stockholders choosing the cash option, they added.  </p>
<p>Koll and Colony said their proposal would result in the distribution of more than $230 million to Santa Anita stockholders. They said they would own about 70 percent of the recapitalized companies and receive a majority of the seats on the boards of directors.</p>
<p>Colony Capital Inc is a Los Angeles investment firm that invests on behalf of Colony Investors II LP, an equity fund. Colony owns about 8.0 percent of the paired stock of Santa Anita.</p>
<p>Koll, which owns 8.7 percent in the companies, had made a previous offer to give Santa Anita shareholders $27 a share and provide the racetrack and real estate firm about $91.5 million in equity, according to a report from the financial daily newspaper The Wall Street Journal.</p>
