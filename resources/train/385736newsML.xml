<p>In the world of toboggan racing the art of winning may be knowing the right mix of wax and weirdness.</p>
<p>&quot;This is like the only athletic event where eating and drinking a lot beforehand may help,&quot; said Susan Chace, an organiser of the National Toboggan Championship, held here earlier this month. The off-beat event features North America's only wood toboggan chute, a 400-foot (122 metre)- long snow-packed trough that looks like a low-tech bobsled track without the curves.</p>
<p>Toboggans are long, flat-bottomed sleds usually made of thin wooden boards, curved up at one end, whereas bobsleds are relatively hi-tech devices with fiberglass bodies that sit on runners. Tobbagan teams with names such as Kevorkian's Alternative -- a reference to the well-known suicide doctor -- Crash Test Dummies and The Tobogganers Formerly Known as Prince careened down the chute and onto a frozen pond.</p>
<p>This coastal Maine town of 4,000 residents has had a toboggan chute since the 1930s. The community-owned equipment fell into disrepair in the 1980s but was rebuilt with voluntary labour and materials.</p>
<p>ONLY U.S. WOODEN TOBOGGAN CHUTE</p>
<p>&quot;Then, of course, somebody said, 'Oh we've got to race,'&quot; Chace said. &quot;We figured we have the only wooden toboggan chute in the country, so we can also declare ourselves the national championship.&quot;</p>
<p>The race is now in its seventh year and draws more than 200 competitors from as far as California. They range in age from teenagers to two men who admitted they were &quot;70-odd.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It all comes down to what you put on the bottom of your sled and your attitude,&quot; said Linda Newell, who with her real-life sister, Betty Emmons, donned a Catholic nun's headgear to run the race as &quot;The Sister Act.&quot;</p>
<p>Although most competitors acknowledged their sleds were the kind found in any sporting goods store, each team jealously guarded at least one trade secret -- the wax or other lubricant used to ease the toboggan's slide.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who know don't say and those who say don't know,&quot; said Tom Sadowski, who has competed in six of the races.</p>
<p>RACCOON FAT THE SECRET?</p>
<p>Among the suggestions given a reporter: Lemon Pledge furniture polish, blueberry candle wax and a &quot;mystery wax formula&quot; that was said to feature raccoon fat. &quot;They claim to pick up roadkill all year long,&quot; one racer said, pointing to where raccoon fat advocates were working on their toboggans.</p>
<p>A wrong wax choice can prove embarrassing. A few racers whose toboggans got stuck on the snow midway down the chute were greeted with calls of &quot;Push! Push!&quot; from the crowd.</p>
<p>&quot;At least we didn't get lost on the course,&quot; rationalised one first-time racer from Massachusetts whose toboggan stopped ignominiously a few yards (metres) from the finish line.</p>
<p>The focus on selecting the right wax might also be explained by the fact that once the sled is launched there is little for the racers to do but hang on.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't need any skill,&quot; Chace admitted. &quot;It's hard to be hi-tech.&quot;</p>
<p>Toboggan racing enthusiasts contend the time may be right for their sport's comeback. &quot;I think that's why people like it -- because it is so dumb,&quot; Chace said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Organisers of the National Toboggan Champshionship expect their event to grow. Racers have already reserved spots in next year's competition and the event may be reorganized to allow more teams.</p>
