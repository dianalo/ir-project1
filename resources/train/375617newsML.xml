<p>Cubic Corp Chief Financial Officer Bill Boyle said he expects fiscal 1997 earnings per share to grow to $1.35 from last year's $1.23 and sees rapid growth in the next few years.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd hate to be overly bullish, but long-term we see very substantial growth,&quot; Boyle told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We anticipate (growth) in 1998 and 1999 individually will be greater than what we expect in 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will grow at a faster rate each year over the next three years.&quot;</p>
<p>Boyle said he expects growth from 1997 to 1998 will approach 20 percent, bringing earnings to $1.62 a share.</p>
<p>Boyle also added that he expects flat to lower revenues this year as Cubic adjusts to the sale of its toll road business, but then sees growth of 10 percent to 15 percent annually &quot;for as far ahead as we can see right now, and that could be conservative.&quot;</p>
<p>Cubic had 1996 revenues of $407 million.</p>
<p>Formed in 1951 San Diego-based, Cubic specializes in tactical training equipment for the defense industry and public transport revenue collection services.</p>
<p>During the Vietnam war, Cubic began to focus on defense tactical training.  Cubic developed technology to record and playback airborne &quot;dog-fights&quot; which helped train pilots.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for the defense business is very good but in the short run there is a problem,&quot; Boyle said. &quot;It is costing us a little bit more to develop (Miles 2000) than we thought which is a short term depressant on earnings this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Miles 2000 is a training system using laser &quot;bullets&quot; to train soldiers while reducing the risk of casualties. Cubic has a contract for the product with the U.S. Army and Marines.</p>
<p>The contract could be worth $500 million if all options are excercised. Cubic predicts potential foreign sales of Miles 2000 could be in the same ballpark.</p>
<p>Despite higher costs, Boyle said the defense business should still be profitable in 1997. &quot;Long term it's going to be a tremendous business for us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This is also a watershed year for the revenue collection business it operates around the world in several cities, including New York, Washington, London and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Cubic is near to closing negotiations for privatization of the London Underground's revenue collection, the first ever such privatization. &quot;That competition has essentially been won,&quot; Boyle said, adding the contract could yield $500 million with most of the revenues coming in the first three years.</p>
<p>Orders from the London system were suspended during the negotiations resulting in lower 1997 revenues for Cubic.</p>
<p>Boyle said New York, Montreal and Sydney have contacted Cubic about possible privatization projects and expects a lot of growth in this area if privatization catches on.</p>
<p>Boyle said the company should end 1997 with a backlog of about $400 million, up from $312 million a the end of 1996.</p>
