<p>Czech Finance Minister- designate Ivan Pilip said on Thursday that resolving the current crown crisis and cleaning up the country's capital markets were top priorities he faced when he takes his position at the ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;There are three top priorities: first stabilisation of the currency with the closest possible cooperation with the central bank; renewal of conditions for all forms of collective investment in capital markets,&quot; he said adding the third priority was reaching social agreements with labour.  </p>
<p>Pilip, who was named as Finance Minister on Wednesday but must still be officially confirmed by President Vaclav Havel, staked his political future on the success of the government measures saying he would not only leave his post, &quot;but possibly leaving politics for good&quot;.</p>
<p>Sitting beside Pilip at a news conference of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said three things were necessary for the success of the package announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He said Havel's support, maintaining the integrity of the coalition and at least a basic temperance by the opposition and unions were needed to allow the measures to succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very important that this solution has the support of the President. So far we understand it as conditional...We will develop efforts for this support to become real and authentic,&quot; Klaus said.  </p>
<p>Klaus, in a dramatic acknowledgement of the Czech economy's problems, announced on Wednesday sweeping cabinet changes and a six-point recovery plan, including spending cuts and a public sector wage freeze.</p>
<p>The government moves followed two turbulent weeks for the currency as investors, alarmed at yawning trade and current account deficits as well as political uncertainty, dumped the crown.</p>
<p>The fresh spending cuts, put by deputy premier Josef Lux at &quot;tens of billions&quot; of crowns, come on top of 25.5 billion crowns in cuts announced in another austerity package in April.</p>
<p>The cuts will need the approval of parliament where the ruling three-party coalition has the slenderest majority.</p>
<p>Havel said in a statement earlier on Thursday that while the programme agreed late on Wednesday could possibly resolve the immediate situation, it did not address what the government intended to do in the longer term.</p>
<p>He expressed &quot;several doubts&quot; about the plan in a meeting with the three coalition leaders on Thursday, but indicated he might confirm the cabinet changes on Monday.</p>
<p>He said it &quot;still does not mention even a word about long-term programme aims of this coalition and government, and does not, in the new situation, develop and make concrete its programme statement.&quot;</p>
