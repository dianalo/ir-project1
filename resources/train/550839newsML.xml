<title>USA: CBOT wheat ends up on soybean rally, technicals.</title>
<headline>CBOT wheat ends up on soybean rally, technicals.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures ended higher on a rally in soybeans plus follow -through technical strength from the firm tone Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said the wheat market was due for a technical bounce after a recent sharp drop in the market.</p>
<p>Export activity also was mentioned.</p>
<p>&quot;The overnight sale may have helped and Pakistan coming up, the big one is Pakistan,&quot; said Dale Gustafsen, grain analyst for Smith Barney.</p>
<p>USDA early Wednesday said U.S. exporters reported a sale of 110,000 tonnes of wheat to unknown destinations.</p>
<p>Pakistan is slated in the market Saturday for 315,000 tonnes of U.S. or Australian white wheat.</p>
<p>The market also remained edgy over freeze damage estimates in the U.S. hard red winter wheat crop. An Oklahoma State University survey released Wednesday said Oklahoma's 1997 hard red winter wheat output potential was cut by 40.9 percent because of the freeze in early April. Oklahoma is now expected to produce 121.34 million bushels this year, below the previous estimate for this year's output of 205.39 million.</p>
<p>Wheat closed 2-1/2 to 12 cents per bushel higher, with May up 12 at $4.23. July was up 10-1/2 at $4.33-1/2.  </p>
<p>The market shook off bearish influences from the posting Wednesday of 3.12 million bushels of wheat for potential delivery on the May contract. The market was expecting roughly two million bushels to be posted. Wednesday was first notice day for deliveries on the CBOT May agricultural futures contracts.</p>
<p>Traders also said the rally gained momentum despite slightly bearish input from Canada. Statistics Canada Wednesday pegged 1997 Canadian intended wheat seedings at 28.8 million acres, slightly above Canadian trade expectations.</p>
<p>Traders also said the market was edgy about uncertain weather prospects in France. Recent showers in France helped slow deterioration of the wheat crop but more rain is needed to ensure adequate production.</p>
<p>French Farm Minister Philippe Vasseur said that the situation could become serious unless rain fell again within next few weeks.</p>
<p>In spread trading, Goldenberg Hehmeyer did 1.5 million bushels of May/July at 11-1/2 to 10-1/2 cents, premium July, traders said.</p>
<p>Funds bought at least 11.0 million bushels of wheat and Refco Inc bought 4.5 million bushels of July, traders said.</p>
<p>O'Connor and Co bought two million bushels of July and FIMAT Futures bought 2.5 million bushels of July, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 20,000 contracts, below the 20,495 traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>In wheat options, Prudential Securities bought 100 July $4.30 calls and sold 100 July $4.70 calls at 12 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat options volume was estimated at 12,000 contracts, above the 8,060 traded Tuesday.</p>
