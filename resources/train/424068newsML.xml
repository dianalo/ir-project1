<headline>Ag Dept reaches agreements with fruit, nut coops.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Agriculture Department said Thursday it reached compliance agreements with four major fruit and nut cooperatives and decided not to bar them from government programmes.</p>
<p>The agreements were signed with four cooperatives affiliated with Sun-Diamond Growers of California -- Diamond Walnut Growers Inc., Sun-Maid Growers of California, Sunsweet Growers Inc. and Valley Fig Growers.</p>
<p>The agency also lifted a ban on Hazelnut Growers of Oregon because it said the cooperative was not as closely associated to Sun-Diamond as previously indicated. However, Sun-Land Products of California, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun-Diamond, is being barred from doing business with the government for three years.</p>
<p>Sun-Diamond, the nation's largest fruit cooperative, was barred from participating in government programmes on Dec. 18, 1996, for a period of three years after it was convicted for giving illegal gifts to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, participating in an illegal corporate campaign contribution scheme for Espy's brother Henry and violating federal campaign contributions laws.</p>
<p>Richard Douglas, former senior vice president of Sun-Diamond and at one time an influential Washington lobbyist, also was barred for his activities concerning Sun-Diamond's criminal acts.</p>
<p>The charges against Sun-Diamond arose from the special investigation of Mike Espy being conducted by Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz. Espy is being investigated for allegedly accepting illegal gifts and favours while he was a cabinet member from companies his agency was in charge of regulating.</p>
<p>The compliance agreements require the establishment of a corporate code of business ethics and conduct, ethics training for employees, training of all employees in appropriate methods of dealing with government employees, revision of travel and entertainment expense policies and other actions.</p>
<p>The government will receive quarterly reports on the new policies and will conduct unannounced audits. Failure to comply with any part of these agreements could lead to an immediate bar by the Agriculture Department.</p>
