<title>USA: JonBenet's parents give police names of suspects.</title>
<headline>JonBenet's parents give police names of suspects.</headline>
<dateline>BOULDER, Colo. 1997-03-10</dateline>

<p>The parents of murdered 6-year-old beauty pageant winner JonBenet Ramsey have furnished police with between six and 12 names of potential suspects, a newspaper said Monday.</p>
<p>The Rocky Mountain News, quoting sources, said the girl's parents, John and Patricia Ramsey, had given police the names during informal conversations since the girl's body was found in the basement of the family's plush Boulder home on Dec. 26.</p>
<p>City spokeswoman Leslie Aaholm would not confirm the number of suspects but said police have had informal communications with the parents even though the Ramseys have refused to be interviewed formally.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made and no suspects named, although last week police said JonBenet Ramsey's older half-brother and half-sister had been eliminated as suspects. One person whose name was furnished to police by the girl's father told the newspaper he had been interviewed by officers several times.</p>
<p>The man, who agreed to talk to the paper on the condition his identify not be revealed, was a former employee of Access Graphics, the Boulder computer firm headed by John Ramsey. He had left after an undisclosed disagreement with the company.</p>
<p>The girl's body was found by her father about eight hours after her mother said she had found a ransom note. According to published reports the girl had been sexually assaulted.</p>
