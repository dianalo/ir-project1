<text>
<p>A house belonging to accused French Nazi collaborator Maurice Papon, who is due to stand trial for crimes against humanity, has been broken into, police sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said investigators found no reason to link the break-in in the Paris suburb of Pontault-Combault, to a court case in which Papon is accused of organising the deportation of 1,560 Jews to Nazi death camps.</p>
<p>They said the house  had been vandalised and an investigation was under way to establish if anything was stolen.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court last month ordered Papon, 86, to face an assize court for his wartime activities, quashing his last-ditch attempt to avoid trial after 16 years of legal wrangling.</p>
<p>Papon was secretary-general of the southwestern Bordeaux region under German occupation during World War Two.</p>
<p>He enjoyed a brilliant post-war career as Paris police chief from 1968 to 1974 and budget minister in the 1970s before his wartime record became known. He denies the charges and says he remained at his job on orders of the Resistance.</p>
