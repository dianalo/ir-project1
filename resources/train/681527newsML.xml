<p>The haircut was the give-away. Military in length and made for a uniformed cap, it belonged to a Northern Ireland policeman dressed in casual clothes on a shopping trip with his wife in downtown Belfast.</p>
<p>But he refused to recognise the man hailing him, even though, just a day earlier, they had spent some time talking about the province's future when he was uniformed and carrying a gun.</p>
<p>Days after the IRA murdered two of his colleagues, this Northern Ireland policeman, like many in the 12,00-strong force, just wanted to be invisible.</p>
<p>The dead men were the 300th and 301st members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be killed in the 28-year Northern Ireland conflict, shot dead in the southern town of Lurgan by IRA hit-men who killed with clinical precision.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) chose them and their high-profile green uniforms because they represent the British rule the guerrillas are sworn to end and are also mainly Protestants, who want the province to stay British.</p>
<p>Being a policeman or policewoman in Northern Ireland means a well-paid job in an economy with 11 percent unemployment, being a target for guerrillas on both sides of the sectarian divide and, in many cases, having to live in a certain anonymity.</p>
<p>Most police give photographs of their passing out parades pride of place on the mantlepiece or entrance to their homes.</p>
<p>But in Northern Ireland they are hidden in drawers so that no unannounced visitor will ever know that there is a member of the RUC in the house.</p>
<p>Every day they they peer under their cars for booby-trap bombs. Only close neighbours know what their occupation is. The tell-tale green police shirts are rarely on the washing line.</p>
<p>Days after IRA blew holes in a peace process, the RUC is back on the front-line of a growing guerrilla war.</p>
<p>POLICE ARE THE IRA'S MAIN TARGET</p>
<p>Throughtout the conflict, the RUC and British troops who guard their patrols have been the IRA's chief target in country lanes, at town checkpoints and even city centres.</p>
<p>For 17 brief months of an IRA truce they abandoned their customary flak jackets and automatic rifles and went after what they call ODC's - Ordinary Decent Criminals - and, residents say, had an unprecedented purge on speeding motorists.</p>
<p>But that honeymoon ended when the IRA ended its truce in February last year with the bombing of London's Canary Wharf complex which killed two and reignited the conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Canary Wharf bomb went off, my heart sank. I thought to myself 'we're on a slide. It's starting again',&quot; recalled a veteran officer, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>He had seen at first hand the depths of a 1969-1994 IRA guerrilla war that erupted in daylight on street corners or along darked country lanes in a conflict that killed 3,200.</p>
<p>Officers torn apart by guerrilla rockets. Bewildered parents being led into hospitals to identify loved ones found bound, gagged and shot, victims of sectarian murder gangs.</p>
<p>IRA TOLD TO TARGET SECURITY FORCES</p>
<p>A senior British security source said IRA &quot;volunteers&quot; have been told by their commanders to attack Northern Ireland soldiers and police officers, preferably while on duty and in uniform, in an escalation of a war to end British rule. &quot;The threat is high against security forces right across the province,&quot; the source told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The IRA is quite well supplied. Alongside all their commercially-produced weaponry, they have also always relied heavily on home-made weapons which are just effective.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lurgan IRA murders were the first of police officers since the IRA ceasefire ended and marked a return of the guerrillas to their Northern Ireland battleground after months of relative calm.</p>
<p>The killings took place weeks before the annual &quot;marching season&quot; by Protestants takes place, a flashpoint period which last year descended into the worst civil strife the province has seen for decades.</p>
<p>In July last year police chiefs banned a traditional march from a church at Drumcree through the Catholic Carvaghy area of the southern town of Portadown because Catholics objected and said the march amounted to intimidation.</p>
<p>The ban was lifted after Protestants paralysed the province with riots, road blocks and fires. The march went ahead, triggering days of Catholic rioting instead.</p>
<p>Throughout the men and women of the RUC were targets for both sides. &quot;We know where you live, we know where your houses are,&quot; Protestant extremists taunted police who blocked their path at Drumcree.</p>
<p>In Londonderry, a Catholic stronghold, police were showered with hundreds of petrol bombs, rocks and missiles in an explosion of anger that took thousands of police and days to douse.</p>
<p>Distrusted by sections of Catholics and regarded by many Protestants as a bulwark for preserving treasured British links, RUC officers say they have been pitched into a no-win position in the middle of age-old rivalries.</p>
<p>&quot;We get it from both sides. We're caught in the middle of this. We're marked men, whatever we do,&quot; said the police officer who preferred not to be recognised while shopping in Belfast.</p>
<p>It is a normal precaution. Children are gently reminded not to leave doors open and to not to talk too much about &quot;what dad does&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;You try to strike a balance between not being careless and being alive to the fact that there are people who would maybe go to your house and plant a bomb under your car or shoot at your home,&quot; a long-serving officer said.</p>
