<p>Germany's blue-chip DAX index hit new record high in bourse trade on Thursday and ended on a new closing high. Dealers said 4,500 points was within reach, even though volumes are lower than in previous days.</p>
<p>The 4,500-point level would count as yet another landmark in the current bull-run. Technical analysts say that the current upward trend line is still intact.</p>
<p>The DAX index ended at 4,438.93 points, up 17.21 points or 0.39 percent.</p>
<p>The September DAX future earlier came to within a whisker of 4,500 when it hit 4,498 points.</p>
<p>&quot;We were a bit shaky at the beginning. Volumes are a little lower than in recent days, but I'm confident that we can reach 4,500 points at some stage over the day,&quot; a Frankfurt broker said.</p>
<p>Another successful run on Wall Street overnight underpinned early gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Index closing around one percent higher at 8,254.89 points.</p>
<p>The dollar was slightly weaker at around 1.83 marks, but remained stable and provided support. &quot;I can't think of anything original to say anymore about the dollar and the German share market,&quot; one Frankfurt broker said.</p>
<p>Among the main corporate news were industrial giant Daimler-Benz's first-half figures, which came in at around expectations.</p>
<p>Operating profit in the first half rose to 1.849 billion marks compared to 827 million marks in the same period a year previously.</p>
<p>Shares in Daimler fell after the figures and ended the session down 4.50 marks at 154.80 marks, which dealers said was mostly due to profit-taking as the share had risen around nine percent already during the week.</p>
<p>Focus over the session was again on the financial sector. Among losers were banks Vereinsbank down two marks at 101 marks and Hypo-Bank down 1.07 marks at 76.53 marks.</p>
<p>Insurer Allianz AG Holding was down 9.50 marks at 1,470 marks. Earlier Vereinsbank detailed the terms of its planned merger with its fellow Bavarian bank Hypo-Bank. It said its offer to exchange one share in Allianz for six shares in Hypo-Bank would run from August 4 to September 10.</p>
<p>The utility sector was in favour as part of a sector rotation, dealers said, with the sector in need of some catch-up having trailed other sectors, notably the banks and the chemical companies, in the recent record-breaking run.</p>
<p>Veba AG ended up 3.70 marks at 106.90 marks, Viag AG was up 3.50 marks at 793.00 marks and RWE AG was up 70 pfennigs at 81.80 marks.</p>
