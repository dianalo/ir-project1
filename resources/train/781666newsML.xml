<headline>Wills seeks 48-hr trading halt, stops sales.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>Australian tobacco group WD &amp; HO Wills Holdings Ltd said it had been forced to suspend sales to assess the full implication of a &quot;draconian&quot; increase in tobacco excise announced earlier on Wednesday and is seeking a 48-hour trading halt for its shares from Thursday morning.  </p>
<p>This follows the announcement by the Federal government of a 200 percent increase in excise on tobacco products, Wills said.</p>
<p>It said the excise change will lead to a A$500 million increase in total revenue collected by the Federal government, states and territories.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello earlier said said Canberra would replace at midnight (1400 GMT) on Wednesday taxes on petrol, alcohol and tobacco levied by state governments with a new regime of uniform national taxes.</p>
<p>The revamp was forced by a High Court decision released on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The court ruled that the state taxes, known as franchise fees, breached Australia's constitution because they were in reality excise duties which can only be levied by the Federal government.</p>
<p>Costello said the Federal excise on tobacco products would rise by A$167 a kg of contained tobacco to A$251.27 a kg.</p>
<p>Wills said that although Costello's press release said he anticipated rebates by the states of additional revenue raised, it has already been announced by some states that they will not support the rebate scheme and other states have not been able to devise a workable system for operating such a scheme.  </p>
<p>&quot;Wills is united with the rest of the tobacco industry in seeking urgent consultation with the Federal Treasurer to overcome the inequity and uncertainty that will inevitably result from the arangements announced today,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Wills, the other listed Australian tobacco group, Rothmans Holdings Ltd and the Australian subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos Inc released a joint industry statement attacking the hike in tobacco excise.</p>
<p>They particularly deplored the lack of arrangements for overpayments to be refunded to manufacturers or importers to avoid consumer price increases, a stated government objective.  </p>
<p>The tobacco companies noted tobacco products were already the most highly taxed consumer goods in Australia.</p>
<p>Wills is majority owned by B.A.T. Industries Plc.</p>
