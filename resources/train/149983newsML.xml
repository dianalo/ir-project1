<p>Mali's official daily said on Tuesday that an alleged plot to kill the country's president was revealed by a &quot;Marabout&quot; witchdoctor consulted by the plotters.</p>
<p>&quot;A Marabout in a village near Bamako consulted by the would-be assassins of the country's leaders blew the whistle after trying in vain to dissuade the plotters,&quot; L'Essoir said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bloody adventure, plotted in the greatest secrecy, would no doubt have gone uncovered had it not been for a lucky turn of chance,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>State radio and television said on Monday night a plot to destabilise Mali's democratic institutions had been thwarted. A government source said the plotters intended to kill President Alpha Oumar Konare, his prime minister and the defence minister.</p>
<p>Apparently brushing off the alleged plot, Konare on Tuesday presided over the opening of an Africa development forum in neighbouring Burkina Faso. He said in his speech there was no room for violence in a modern democracy.</p>
