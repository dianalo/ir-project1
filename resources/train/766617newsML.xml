<headline>Timely rains relieve heat stress on Kansas sorghum.</headline>

<p>Timely rains throughout much of Kansas this week aided the sorghum crop, which had shown signs of stress from hot, dry weather, crop sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point we are not stressed,&quot; said Arlan Suderman, extension agronomist in Sedgwick County.</p>
<p>However, Suderman said more rain will be needed in the next 10 days if the sorghum is to remain healthy.</p>
<p>&quot;It was really stressed the past couple of weeks,&quot; said a Wichita grain dealer. But he said one to 1.5 inches of rain in south central Kansas since the weekend &quot;saved the crop.&quot;</p>
<p>Improvement was so significant farmers this week began forward contracting a portion of their anticipated harvest, something they had resisted because of the dry conditions.</p>
<p>Also encouraging the forward contracting were strong gains in cash prices. Prices increased in unison with gains in CBOT corn futures. Since Friday, CBOT corn for December delivery jumped 20 cents per bushel to $2.63-1/2.</p>
<p>Sorghum to be delivered at harvest time was bid about $2.38-1/2 per bushel near Hutchinson versus $2.18-1/2 Friday. Similar price increases were reported in Texas and at other Kansas locations.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, Kansas sorghum was rated 68 percent good to excellent, but a state agriculture statistics official said those ratings did not reflect improvement in the crop from the recent rain.</p>
<p>Kansas harvested a record 354.2 million bushels of sorghum in 1996, but the 1997 harvest should fall short of that because of fewer acres, the official said. Kansas farmers planted 3.75 million acres versus 4.8 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The Kansas harvest should begin in late September or October.</p>
<p>About 17 percent of the Texas sorghum was harvested as of Sunday and crop sources reported good yields and quality. Much of it was being shipped to cattle feedlots in the Texas panhandle or west to California, grain dealers said.</p>
<p>Texas feedlot sources said sorghum was being used in some feed rations and more feedlots would likely use it when harvest moves north into the panhandle this fall.</p>
<p>Harvest now was confined to central Texas. Near Waco newly-harvested sorghum weighed 60 to 61 lbs per bushel versus a normal 56 lbs.</p>
<p>&quot;That is an excellent test weight,&quot; said  Madison Clement, a partner at Clement Grain Co in Waco.</p>
<p>Clement said yields were not available but he assumed they were high because of the large amount of sorghum being brought to his facility. He was paying farmers $3.85 per cwt Wednesday for sorghum versus $3.75 on Friday.</p>
<p>Texas production also should be down from 1996 because of fewer acres this year. The state agricultural statistics office reported 3.3 million acres were planted to sorghum versus 4.4 million a year ago.</p>
