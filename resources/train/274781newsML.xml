<text>
<p>The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has declared an eight-day mourning period to mark the death of the chimpanzee, Tiao, a favourite with visitors to Rio Zoo and a formidable candidate in the 1988 mayoral elections, newspapers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tiao died of diabetes Monday at Rio Zoo where he was born more than 33 years ago. He would have turned 34 Jan. 16, the equivalent of about 80 human years.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a great loss,&quot; Mayor Cesar Maia was quoted as saying by Jornal do Brasil. &quot;He demonstrated the joyfulness of Rio.&quot;</p>
<p>Flags have been set at half mast at Rio Zoo until Dec. 31 in honour of Tiao, whose greatest claim to fame was his candidacy in the 1988 mayoral elections in which he came in third with more than 400,000 votes. He was launched as a candidate by the Brazilian Banana Party to attract the protest vote.</p>
<p>Tiao's organs will be donated for scientific research purposes.</p>
