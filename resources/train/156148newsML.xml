<title>UK: LME copper slips back below $1,970, pares gains.</title>
<headline>LME copper slips back below $1,970, pares gains.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices turned tail above $1,970 during late afternoon LME trading on Thursday, with profit-taking and technical selling persuading speculative buyers to hold their fire, traders said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the market still concluded a fairly active session in the plus column, and is in good shape for another attempt on the $1,970 level and above in coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;All the ingredients are in place - stocks should be down, the spreads are tight, and there is option covering on time decay to be done,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Warehouse stock data will be of paramount importance on Friday, with the general expectation being a decline of some 5,000/10,000 tonnes. However, the current impressive run of drawdowns may be nearing an end, as some of the metal shipped from Europe is expected to land in Singapore soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The jury is still out on whether the (stock) falls are consumption or just relocation. It could be some time before we find out, because the Chinese figures (import/export) will not show for a month or so,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>If copper is destined for consumption it will be custom-cleared. If it is being moved into bonded warehouses it may well be sold back on to the world market.</p>
<p>Final three months business on the kerb was at $1,958, an $8 a tonne advance from Wednesday's closing kerb.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, zinc prices relinquished highs near $1,070 resistance, with the market in need of a breather after a run-up towards five-month highs.</p>
<p>But the short-term outlook remains bright, given current fund interest, notably the perception that international financier George Soros has a market presence now.</p>
<p>Also, there are expectations of a fall in warehouse stocks on Friday, as well as some late-January 1997 tightness. Final trade was at $1,066, up $12 from the overnight close.</p>
<p>Aluminium stumbled at the $1,450 hurdle in mid-afternoon, having earlier ridden higher in copper's slipstream through the $1,440 level. In the short term traders still favour a foray towards $1,500, but movements will be choppy.</p>
<p>Last trade today was at $1,437, still up $9 from yesterday's kerb. A stock drawdown is expected tomorrow, they said.</p>
<p>Nickel struggled to make much headway throughout the session and mostly held close to overnight levels. Final kerb business was at $7,330, against Wednesday's close of $7,340.</p>
<p>Lead's upside flurry petered out during the afternoon, with prices drifting back from the highs to close at $752, still up $4 from yesterday and a technically sound finish.</p>
<p>The tin market had occasional liaisons with the $6,000 level, but was content to remain in a narrow range. Last trade was at $5,985, little different from the overnight $5,990.</p>
<p>Alloy traded intermittently today, but was generally steadier, and three months finished at $1,288/90, up from Wednesday's close of $1,285.</p>
