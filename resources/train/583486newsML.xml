<headline>UK doctors' body says health spend must increase.</headline>

<p>British doctors on Wednesday welcomed government plans to impose a ban on tobacco advertising, but warned that Labour would have to substantially increase spending on health if the National Health Service (NHS) was to meet the needs of patient care into the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted to see a commitment to tackle the scourge of smoking as a matter of urgency,&quot; British Medical Association (BMA) Chairman Sandy Macara said in a statement. The BMA is a professional body representing British medical practitioners.</p>
<p>But James Johnson, chairman of the BMA consultants' committee, said present policies were leading to a &quot;wholly unjustified reduction in (hospital) bed numbers,&quot; far beyond what could be justified by changes in medical practice.</p>
<p>The new Labour government's plans for health were outlined in a speech earlier by Queen Elizabeth at the opening of the new parliament.</p>
<p>Besides the ban on tobacco advertising, the government said it would introduce legislation enabling hospital and other construction projects that use private capital to go ahead. The government also said it would end inequalities in the delivery of healthcare and reduce the health bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Labour said a reduction in paperwork alone would release 100 million pounds that could be redirected toward patient care.</p>
<p>The government's overall spending plans for the NHS won't be disclosed until Chancellor Gordon Brown delivers his budget to parliament. The budget is widely expected to be on June 10.</p>
<p>However, Labour's spending goals, outlined during the election campaign, foresee an average annual real increase of only 0.6 percent in the NHS's budget over the next three years.</p>
<p>Macara said the government needed to increase health spending by a real three percent each year for the foreseeable future in order to bring UK spending up to the average level of other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD).</p>
<p>The BMA said it welcomed the government's commitment to end competition among hospitals for funding and to create a more equitable system for the financing of primary health care.</p>
<p>But it expressed concern about Labour's reliance on private capital, under its Private Finance Initiative (PFI), to finance capital projects in the health sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate priority must be to let some light into the process so that doctors and the wider public can challenge the assumptions being made and ensure that our hospital-building programme will meet the needs of patient care in the next millennium,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>In her speech, the Queen said the government would introduce legislation to clarify the powers of NHS Trusts, or hospitals, to enter into partnerships with the private sector.</p>
<p>The legislation will make it possible for 73 capital projects worth 794 million pounds in the health sector to go ahead. This includes the construction of two new hospitals serving the Norfolk and Norwich and the Dartford and Gravesham areas in southern England.</p>
