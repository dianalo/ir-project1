<p>CONCERNS OVER POTENTIAL OF LIVING WAGE CLAIM</p>
<p>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is warning that business growth would be devistated if the ACTU's full &quot;Living Wave&quot; claim is granted.</p>
<p>This follows the Reserve Bank's examination, in its lastest bulletin, of the implications of the full claim being granted by the Industrial Relations Commission.</p>
<p>The Bank says the direct effect of the sought after 8-and-three-quarters percent pay rise would be to lift aggregate wage growth well over the danger level of five-per cent.</p>
<p>But the Bank also says that if that happens, it would come with higher interest rates to hold back the rate of inflation.</p>

<p>DROUGHT EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUPPORT REVOKED</p>
<p>Federal Primary Industries Minister, John Anderson, has announced drought exceptional circumstances support for parts of New South Wales and Queensland will end on December the 31st this year.</p>
<p>Mr Anderson says the climatic outlook has improved, with winter and early spring rains providing drought-breaking conditions for winter crop and pasture production.</p>
<p>In Queensland, he's revoked drought exceptional circumstances support in the shires of Diamantina and Barcoo.</p>
<p>In New South Wales, they've been revoked in parts of the the rural land protection board areas of Hay, Hillston, Brewarrina, Balranald and Nyngan.</p>
<p>Mr Anderson says exceptional circumstances support has been ended for the whole shires of Dubbo, Bathurst, Mudgee, Molong and Merriwa.</p>

<p>PARER DEFENDS FOREST MINING DECISION</p>
<p>Federal Resources Minister, Warwick Parer, says the Forest industry has an incredible record of forest rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Senator Parer has defended Cabinet's decision to allow mining in some forest areas, saying he wants areas of high mineral potential excluded from new forest reserves.</p>
<p>Mining will also be allowed in informal reserves, which are classified as less environmentally significant than dedicated reserves.</p>
<p>The States will be allowed to permit mining in dedicated reserves if the Commonwealth agrees.</p>
<p>While the plan's been criticised by conservation groups and the Opposition, Senator Parer has told ABC radio, the mining industry has a good record of working in forests.</p>

<p>MILITARY HAIRCUTS NON-DISCRIMINATORY</p>
<p>The Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner says the dismissal of a soldier's claim that defence force haircuts for men are discriminatory, shows that different treatment isn't necessarily detrimental.</p>
<p>At the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, RAAF Corporal Carl Trindorfer argued that regulations requiring men to have a short military style haircut denies them the freedom available to women.</p>
<p>In dismissing the complaint the Commission rejected the notion the Corporal received less favourable treatment, and said the uniformity of appearance is important for RAAF morale.</p>

<p>CRITICISM OVER SPORTS FUNDING</p>
<p>There's criticism from athletics officials after the announcement the AFL will recieve more than a million dollars extra Federal funding.</p>
<p>Athletics was one of the losers recently when the Australian Sports Commission announced its funding levels leading up to the Sydney Olympics.</p>
<p>And now the AFL has been promised more than a million dollars to establish its Player Academy and Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Athletics Australia chief, Neil King says it's a curious situation when our top track and field hopes must compete as virtual amateurs.</p>

<p>ACB ON PAKISTAN'S TOUR SCHEDULE</p>
<p>Australian Cricket Board chairman Dennis Rogers says any problem the Pakistan cricket captain has with his team's Australian tour schedule should be taken up with Pakistan's Cricket Board.</p>
<p>Wasim Akram says the schedule is very frustrating, because the one-day tournament could have been competed in three or four weeks.</p>
<p>Akram says instead, his team has a fortnight between international matches.</p>
<p>Dennis Rogers says the tour schedule was negotiated by the cricket boards of both countries, and those conditions would have been agreed to by Pakistan.</p>
