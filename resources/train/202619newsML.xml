<p>TransTexas Gas Corp said on Wednesday it expected to post a profit in the fourth quarter ending January 31.</p>
<p>Simon Ward, a company spokesman, said TransTexas expected &quot;to report improved earnings in its fourth fiscal quarter,&quot; citing increased production and higher natural gas prices.</p>
<p>TransTexas lost $0.17 per share, including a hedging loss of $0.09 per share, in the January 1996 quarter, which was the second quarter of a six-month transition period.</p>
<p>The First Call consensus estimate for the fourth quarter ending January 31, 1997, is earnings of $0.12 per share.  </p>
<p>Ward declined comment on the fourth-quarter First Call estimate. But he said the consensus forecast of a third-quarter loss of $0.10 per share was &quot;pretty accurate.&quot; He said the company would report third-quarter results in early to mid-December.</p>
<p>Ward also said the price TransTexas received for spot natural gas was more than $3 per million Btu Wednesday and has remained more than $2.50 per million on all sales since the beginning of November.</p>
<p>He said one presale deal for delivery next month fetched $3.45 per million Btu.</p>
<p>Ward said about 50 percent of the company's volumes are subject to spot-market and indexed pricing, explaining the indexed prices are done on a weekly or monthly basis to reflect spot pricing.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of its third quarter on August 1, the company said, its total gross production capacity has increased 45 percent to 750 million cubic feet per day.</p>
<p>That results in a net production of about 535 million cubic feet a day, Ward said.</p>
