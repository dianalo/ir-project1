<p>There are 84 days to go before the British colony reverts to China. These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>-- The ECONOMIC JOURNAL said that to maintain Hong Kong's vigorous economic growth, it should attract good-quality immigrants from China. It expressed the hope that the future Special Administrative Region government would have the power to decide which people Hong Kong accepted, so that it could set up a better welfare system for new immigrants accordingly.</p>
<p>-- The Beijing-backed TA KUNG PAO said Hong Kong people's basic rights and freedoms would be protected by the Basic Law after the handover. But, the paper said, guaranteeing most people's freedom to gather and demonstrate required regulation and organisation. If everybody acted as they pleased, the result would be chaos as if people and cars stopped obeying traffic lights, and nobody would have to freedom to walk about, it said.</p>
<p>-- The English-language HONGKONG STANDARD said news that China would sign one of the United Nations' conventions on human rights showed that Beijing had been moving in the direction of adopting these conventions for some months. China had seriously embarked on modernisation, including modernising the mind, only in recent times. The process would take time and China would change at its own pace, the paper said.</p>
