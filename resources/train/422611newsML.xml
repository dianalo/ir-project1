<p>Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Wednesday that data showing German economic output unchanged in the fourth quarter did not point to new weakness in the economy, and recovery would resume this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that seasonally-adjusted GDP was unchanged in the fourth quarter against the previous quarter does not point in any way to renewed weakness in growth,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;During 1997 the recovery should resume.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier, the Bundesbank published figures which showed that fourth quarter economic output rose by 0.1 percent against the third quarter and by 2.2 percent over a year earlier.</p>
<p>Rexrodt added that foreign demand was providing a lasting stimulus to the German economy. The continuing &quot;normalisation&quot; of the value of the mark and global economic recovery were also positive factors.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important that the spark of better demand and production prospects jumps across to domestic investment. This is a key precondition for creating new jobs and ensuring that domestic demand gathers pace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rounded figures published by the Federal Statistics Office showed fourth quarter GDP unchanged against the previous quarter and up 1.9 percent year-on-year. Economists tend to view the Bundesbank data as more accurate and reliable.</p>
