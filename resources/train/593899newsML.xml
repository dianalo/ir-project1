<title>USA: Con Edison plans Fall holding company vote.</title>
<headline>Con Edison plans Fall holding company vote.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-19</dateline>

<p>Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc expects to hold a special shareholders' meeting this fall to vote on its plans to form a holding company, chief executive Eugene McGrath said Monday.</p>
<p>The holding company proposal will need the favorable vote of the holders of two thirds of the utility's common and $5 preferred stock, he said in remarks prepared for the annual meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Owners of Con Edison's common stock will automatically become owners of the holding company's stock, on a one-for-one basis, Chief Financial Officer Joan Freilich told shareholders.  </p>
<p>&quot;Con Edison -- the company we all know today -- will become the regulated subsidiary of the holding company,&quot; she pointed out.</p>
<p>This regulated distribution company &quot;will continue to be the source of most of our earnings for the foreseeable future,&quot; McGrath said.  &quot;More than 70 percent of our net utility plant is invested in our energy delivery systems -- that's about $8 billion.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said ProMark Energy, an unregulated subsidiary formed in 1993, is exploring opportunities to partner with other companies to provide energy commodities and services.  </p>
<p>&quot;Increasingly, throughout our business, such alliances and partnerships will be characteristic of how we'll operate and how we'll grow,&quot; he pointed out.</p>
<p>McGrath said &quot;We expect a number of new ventures to provide additional growth opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>Through unregulated Gramercy Development, he said, &quot;we'll be helping develop energy and municipal infrastructure projects both in the United States and overseas.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Gramercy recently invested in a company working on developing energy projects overseas, initially in Latin America.  In addition, its executives are discussing investments in energy infrastructure projects with business leaders and government officials in China and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>McGrath said a third unregulated subsidiary will focus on energy supply.  It will participate in the competitive power generation market and could provide maintenance and construction services. ((-- Jim Brumm 212-859-1710.))</p>
