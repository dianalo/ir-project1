<p>Congress late Tuesday approved a House-Senate compromise bill that guarantees new mothers and their infants at least two days in the hospital and expands mental health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>On a vote of 388-25, the House agreed to provide $64.4 billion in funds for housing programmes, environmental protection and veterans' health care in the 1997 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It was three percent more than Congress supplied for the current 1996 year, but 3.5 percent less than President Clinton had requested.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day the Senate had deemed the bill passed upon approval by the House.</p>
<p>Unlike the strident debate over spending that occurred last fall, this measure cleared with relative ease. Clinton won funding for his prized AmeriCorps youth service programme at the 1996 level of $400 million from the Senate after the House had voted to terminate the programme.</p>
<p>It also gives veterans' health and disability benefits to children with spina bifida whose parents were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. This would take effect Oct. 1, 1997.</p>
<p>The other health reforms would not be in place until Jan. 1, 1998. Under the plan, women who have had Caesarean sections would be guaranteed at least 96 hours in the hospital.</p>
<p>Insurers would not be required to offer mental health coverage, but those who do would have to provide the same annual and lifetime maximum payment as they do for physical ailments. Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees would be exempt as would federal Medicare and Medicaid programmes. This mental health parity provision expires Sept. 30, 2001.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency will receive $6.7 billion, an increase of $140 million from 1996. Among the programmes the bill pays for are the superfund toxic waste clean up at $1.3 billion, enforcement of toxic waste disposal laws and state clean and safe drinking water revolving funds at $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was given full funding for its space shuttle programme and its international space station. The two were allotted $5.5 billion of NASA's $13.7 billion.</p>
<p>For the nation's public housing programmes, $19.5 billion would be allocated in 1997, two percent more than in 1996 and 11 percent less than Clinton sought.</p>
