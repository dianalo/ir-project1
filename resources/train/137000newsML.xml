<headline>Three convicted for bomb hoax on Florida base.</headline>

<p>A court in Jacksonville has convicted a former sailor and two civilians of making bomb threats against the Naval Air Station here, a Navy spokeswoman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marshall Mayo, aged 21, Sherrie Lynn Tatum, 20, and Justin Thompson, 20, a former sailor in the U.S. Navy, were convicted Tuesday after a five-day trial of conspiracy to make bomb threats and making threats between April and July, spokeswoman Miriam Larue said.</p>
<p>Numerous threats were telephoned into the Naval Air Station's Hangar 1000, which handles routine maintenance and houses a naval flight training squadron and four anti-submarine warfare squadrons.</p>
<p>Witnesses testified that the threats were called in so the hangar would be evacuated and the defendants sent home from work.</p>
<p>The hangar operates a 24-hour, three-shift per day operation employing more than 3,000 military and civilian personnel.</p>
<p>Mayo and Thompson face up to 15 years in prison and a $750,000 fine and Tatum could receive up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.</p>
