<p>Kimberly-Clark Corp Monday reported higher operating and net earnings in the second quarter, despite its merger with Scott Paper Co cutting its operating income by $0.04 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating profit was adversely affected by strategic changes related to the combination of Kimberly-Clark's and Scott Paper Co's away-from-home businesses in North America.&quot; a company statement said. &quot;The transition has resulted in lower sales and higher costs, with a negative impact on operating profit in the second quarter equivalent to $0.04 a share.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company posted an net income of $363.5 million, or $0.65 a share, in the second quarter, compared with $364.7 million, or $0.64 a share the year before. Excluding an extraordinary gain in the second quarter and non-operating items in both years, the company earned $0.60 a share in the second-quarter, compared with $0.56 a share last year.</p>
<p>A First Call consensus estimate of 11 brokers had put the company's earnings at $0.62 a share.  </p>
<p>The company's second quarter sales dropped 6.7 percent to $3.1 billion from $3.3 billion. However, Kimberly-Clark said sales exclusive of revenues from businesses sold in the periods dropped about one percent for the quarter.</p>
<p>Sales of personal care products rose 10.6 percent to $1.33 billion in the second quarter, but tissue sales dropped 15.1 percent to $1.63 billion and newsprint and paper sales plummeted 28.5 percent to $176.8 million.  </p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark posted a 36.2 percent rise in personal care products' operating profits to $249.3 million in the quarter. Operating profits in tissue-based products, however, dropped 18.3 percent to $206.8 million. The newsprint and paper division's operating profit dropped 30.9 percent to 43.9 million.</p>
<p>Boosted by the strong personal care products' sales and profits, the company's total operating profit rose 1.3 percent to $494.4 from $488.2 million in the second quarter.  </p>
<p>On the plus side, the company's operating margin increased to 15.8 percent of sales in the quarter from 14.6 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Our personal care business continued to perform very well, with strong volume growth in every region and improved productivity,&quot; said chief executive Wayne Sanders in a statement. &quot;We also continued to benefit from our focus on costs reductions and lower interest expense.&quot;</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark's interest expense dropped to $40.0 million for the quarter from $50.5 last year. The company attributed the drop to its paying off debt, which stood at about $1.9 billion at the quarter's end, compared with $2.5 billion last year.</p>
<p>The company said it bought back 5.6 million shares year-to-date, including 600,000 in the second quarter. It added its board has authorized repurchasing 7.8 million more.</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark's results seemed to disappoint investors Monday: The company's stock dropped 3-11/16 to 47-7/8 in morning trading.</p>
