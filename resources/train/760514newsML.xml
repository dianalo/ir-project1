<title>USA: Hercules muscles into growing corp debt arena.</title>
<headline>Hercules muscles into growing corp debt arena.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hercules Inc is expected to muscle in among other opportunistic issuers looking to capitalize on lower rates to finance debt, as anxious investors clamor for more, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market tone remains very good and supply has been easily absorbed,&quot; said one syndicate source. &quot;I imagine we'll have another busy week.&quot;</p>
<p>Currently, the yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond remains below 6.50 percent, drawing more issuers into the market.</p>
<p>Among them is Hercules' $200 million debt offering.  </p>
<p>Salomon Brothers is expected to underwrite the deal.</p>
<p>Quebecor Printing, a unit of Quebecor Inc, is a leading commercial printer in Canada and Europe and the second largest in the United States.</p>
<p>Another issuer, Taubman Realty, is expected to issue $100 million in debt via Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>IES Industries is expected to bring a $135 million 12-year issue via competitive bid on Wednesday, players said.</p>
<p>Still on the investment grade horizon is a $2.5 billion debt offering by Raytheon Co expected next week.  </p>
<p>A big week is on tap for the high-yield market as about 20 new junk issues totalling $3.5 billion are expected to hit the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Close to $700 million in domestic 144a private placement debt deals are slated to come to market on Monday, with another $350 million coming via the euro 144a market, players said.</p>
<p>Among the deals is Primus Telecommunications Group's $125 million seven-year notes via Lehman Brothers. Price talk on the issue is seen between 11.50 to 11.75 percent, syndicates sources said.  </p>
<p>Golden Ocean Group Ltd is also set to tap the market with $150 million in seven-year 144a notes, players said.</p>
<p>So far on Monday, among foreign issuers, Mexico based Axa SA de CV, a diversified manufacturer of industrial products and processed meats, sold $200 million seven-year euro 144a debt at 300 basis points via Chase Securities.</p>
<p>Guatemala is also expected to tap the euro market with a $150 million 10-year 144a debt offering, sources said.</p>
<p>Jakarta-based Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritus Ltd, the Indonesian paper firm, is slated to bring $400 million seven-year senior unsecured 144a notes via Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.  </p>
<p>Price talk on the issue is seen at 400 basis points over Treasuries, sources said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last week saw about $8.4 billion in new straight corporate debt issuance hit the market amid falling interest rates, dealers said. About $5.0 billion in high-grade debt was priced, with another $3.4 billion in junk offerings.</p>
<p>The steady pace of debt issuance is expected to continue; however, players will be watching this week's batch of U.S. economic statistics for any change in market tone.</p>
<p>&quot;We started out last week not expecting a whole lot but we came off with a very good week for issuance,&quot; said one syndicate source.</p>
<p>&quot;This week we have a lot of economic numbers so we're just waiting to see what develops,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Although no economic data is scheduled for Monday, Tuesday's reports will include U.S. employment cost index for the second quarter and July U.S. consumer confidence.</p>
