<p>The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR on Wednesday cautiously welcomed Canada's proposal for a military airdrop of supplies to Rwandan refugees in east Zaire.</p>
<p>But UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo said airdrops would still require a presence on the ground to ensure that supplies reached refugees in need instead of Hutu militiamen.</p>
<p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, has repeatedly called for the deployment of a multi-national task force in east Zaire to help aid agencies gain access to an estimated 700,000 wandering refugees scattered in the region.</p>
<p>The return home of 500,000 Hutus has weakened support for that plan, vehemently opposed by Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome any plan that would ease the suffering of these people,&quot; del Mundo said. &quot;But an airdrop would depend on ground presence. It could be a last resort. There would still be a need to determine on the ground who the recipients are.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada, leading a planned U.N.-authorised military relief effort, has proposed parachuting food over Zaire from a base in neighbouring Uganda which lacks good road links with east Zaire.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry, visiting NATO's southern command in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday ruled out sending a U.S. combat force to Zaire but said Washington was ready to take part in the Canadian airdrop proposal.</p>
<p>Several countries have tentatively offered to take part in the military relief effort but have yet to decide the next step.</p>
<p>In recent years food supplies have been parachuted to Moslems in Bosnia and to Kurds in northern Iraq where some falling crates killed or injured civilians.</p>
<p>The Hutu refugees fled to east Zaire in fear of reprisal for a 1994 Hutu-led genocide of minority Tutsis after which a Tutsi-dominated army swept to power in Rwanda.</p>
