<p>TI's orders for continuing operations for 1996 were $9.3 billion, down 23 percent from $12.1 billion in 1995. Significantly reduced DRAM prices in the components segment were the primary contributor to the change.</p>
<p>TI's net revenues for continuing operations for 1996 were $9.9 billion, down 13 percent from $11.4 billion in 1995. The decrease in the components segment was due to significantly lower DRAM prices and reduced royalties. Digital signal processors and mixed-signal/analog products grew strongly in 1996.  In the digital products segment, the sale of substantially all the Custom Manufacturing Services (CMS) business in the first quarter and the sale of the printer business in the third quarter accounted for most of the decrease.</p>
<p>PFO from continuing operations for 1996, excluding the special charges, was $374 million, down from $1439 million in 1995 primarily because of significantly lower DRAM prices and reduced royalties.  Including the special charges, loss from operations was $26 million.</p>
<p>Net loss from continuing operations including special charges in 1996 was $46 million, and loss per share was $0.24.</p>
<p>Results from continuing operations for 1995 included $257 million of profit sharing. There was no profit sharing in 1996.</p>
<p>TI's orders for continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 1996 were $2422 million, compared with $3018 million for the same period in 1995. Significantly reduced DRAM prices in the components segment and the sale of the CMS and printer businesses in 1996 in the digital products segment were the primary reasons for the decrease.</p>
<p>Net revenues for continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 1996 were $2459 million, compared with $3147 million in the fourth quarter of 1995.  The decrease was due primarily to reduced DRAM prices in the components segment and lower mobile computing  revenues, and the absence of revenues associated with the sale of the CMS and printer businesses.</p>
<p>Excluding the special charges, PFO from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 1996 was $173 million, down from $371 million in the same period of 1995. The decrease was due primarily to reduced DRAM prices. Including the special charges, operating loss from continuing operations was $35 million.</p>
<p>Net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 1996 was $40 million, and loss  per share was $0.21, compared with net income of $268 million and earnings per share of $1.38 in the fourth quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Royalty revenues were $300 million lower in 1996 than the record royalties received in 1995.  The decrease is primarily due to a reduction in royalty rates in exchange for longer-term agreements, expired licenses that have not yet been renewed, and licensees' lower DRAM revenues.  Also, first-quarter 1995 royalty revenues included a favorable adjustment of $36 million related to higher-than-estimated licensee shipments in the second half of 1994.</p>

<p>Depreciation for continuing operations for 1996 was $904 million, compared with $681 million in 1995, and $275 million in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with $185 million in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Depreciation in 1997 is expected to be about $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Components Segment</p>
<p>For 1996, orders in the components segment were down 27 percent, and revenues were down 15 percent from 1995, primarily because of the precipitous drop in DRAM prices and lower royalties.  DSPS revenues increased strongly from 1995. Components segment profits were down from 1995 because of sharply lower DRAM prices and lower royalties.  Results for the components segment include a charge of $192 million in the third quarter of 1996 related to the SSi acquisition and a charge of $61 million in the fourth quarter of 1996 for cost reduction actions.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter of 1996, orders in the components segment were down 17 percent over the same period in 1995. Segment revenues were down 18 percent from the same period of a year ago, reflecting significantly lower DRAM prices. Segment profit, excluding the special charge and catch-up royalty, declined from the fourth quarter of 1995 primarily because of sharply lower DRAM prices and lower royalties. Compared to 3Q96, segment profit excluding charges was up substantially.</p>
<p>Digital Products Segment</p>
<p>Orders in TI's digital products segment were down 13 percent in 1996, and revenues were down seven percent, compared with 1995.  Excluding the CMS and printer businesses, which were sold during the year, revenues were up 37 percent. The segment operated at a loss during the year, due to the high level of marketing expense and intense price competition in mobile computing, as well as continued investments and new product development in the software business and in communications and electronics systems. Results for the digital products segment include a charge of $125 million in the fourth quarter for cost reduction actions and asset writedowns.  </p>
<p>In addition to the charge for asset writedowns taken in the fourth quarter, TI expects to take a charge in the first quarter of 1997 for severance and other costs associated with the sale of the mobile computing business. As a result of the sale agreement, TI will not reflect operating results of the mobile computing business subsequent to 1996.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter of 1996, orders in the digital products segment were down 45 percent and revenues were down 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 1995.  Adjusting for the absence of CMS and printers, revenues were down 20 percent from the year-ago quarter.  Excluding the special charges, the segment operated at a loss for the quarter.</p>
<p>Discontinued Operations</p>
<p>For discontinued operations, a special pre-tax charge of $32 million was taken for voluntary and involuntary severance actions during the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Financial Condition</p>
<p>TI's financial condition remains sound.  During the year, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments decreased by $575 million to $978 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the pay-out of 1995 profit sharing in the first quarter. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $2063 million for the year, and the sale of TI's CMS business generated $132 million of cash in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, TI acquired Silicon Systems Inc. via a stock purchase agreement for $340 million in cash plus the assumption of a $235 million long-term note to TDK Corp. of Japan.  The cash payment, initially financed by a draw down on TI's existing line of bank credit, was permanently financed through the company's issuance on July 26 of $400 million of three-and four-year notes.</p>
<p>On January 6, 1997, TI and Raytheon Company announced that their boards of directors have approved a definitive agreement for Raytheon to purchase the assets of TI's defense operations for $2.95 billion in cash.  The transaction is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust review and is expected to close in the second quarter of 1997.  TI plans to use the net proceeds from the sale to strengthen its focus on digital solutions for the networked society.</p>
<p>The outstanding balance of commercial paper was $299 million at the end of the year, up from zero at the end of 1995.  Other financing activities included the first quarter issuance of $300 million of 6.125 percent notes due in 2006, the balance increase of Italian lira mortgage notes of $102 million in the second quarter, and the August 28 redemption, at par, of $150 million of nine percent notes due in 1999.  At year-end, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .33, up from .17 at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Unused authorizations for future capital expenditures were $795 million at December 31, 1996.  Capital expenditures are planned to be about $1.1 billion in 1997, compared with $2.1 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>The company maintains lines of credit to support commercial paper borrowings and to provide additional liquidity. These lines of credit totaled $696 million at December 31, 1996.  Of this amount, $600 million exists to support outstanding and future commercial paper borrowings or short-term bank loans.</p>
<p>The company believes that its financial condition provides the foundation for continued support of the programs essential to TI's future. Industry Segment Net Revenues</p>
