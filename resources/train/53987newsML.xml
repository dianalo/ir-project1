<p>Sierra Leone's justice minister said on Friday the government had enough evidence to convict two former military rulers for defrauding the state of $982,000 from the sale of Sierra Leonean passports to Hong Kong Chinese.</p>
<p>Solomon Berewa told a news conference that a Chinese businessman, who coordinated the passport sales in Hong Kong, had testified against Captain Valentine Strasser and Brigadier Julius Maada Bio.</p>
<p>&quot;We have enough evidence now to convict Captain Strasser and Brigadier Bio on this matter. Strasser and Bio deposited the money they received illegally in banks in Switzerland, the Channel Islands and Ghana. The government now has copies of the accounts,&quot; Berewa said.</p>
<p>He said the Chinese businessman had paid Strasser and Bio the money, some in person and some by telegraphic transfer to accounts they named.</p>
<p>A decree passed by the former military government giving its members immunity from prosecution will come before parliament shortly. Berewa said there was a strong possibility that the parliament elected in February would scrap the decree, and if so, the government would seek Strasser and Bio's extradition to stand trial. Both men are thought to be in Britain.</p>
<p>Bio ousted Strasser in a coup in January, then organised presidential and parliamentary elections the following month.</p>
<p>Berewa said charges had been dropped against former foreign minister Abass Bundu, who on Friday repaid the $210,000 he was charged with receiving from passport sales.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese have been seeking foreign passports as insurance for when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule next year.</p>
