<title>USA: Warren council to consider ban on throwing objects.</title>

<p>Warren City Council will consider a ban on throwing objects during meetings Tuesday night, after a council member said a local woman hurled a toy ice cream cone at the city attorney.</p>
<p>Councilwoman Gloria Sankuer, who proposed the ban, said the toy was thrown at city attorney George Constance two weeks ago by Olga Dziwanowski, who wants a change in the policy covering &quot;double-dipping&quot; -- the practice of collecting both city council pay and city pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a bit of a distance between the microphone and where we were sitting, so it was quite upsetting,&quot; she said. &quot;I looked at (Constance) and he was very stunned. It wasn't like he was ready to catch.&quot;</p>
<p>Dziwanowski, who has been attending city council meetings since 1969, disputed that version. She said Constance had often teased her about bringing the homemade cloth, cotton-filled ice cream cone to council meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked at the city attorney and said 'You've been wanting this for a long time. Are you ready? Catch,' and I tossed it to him,&quot; she said. &quot;I did not throw it.&quot;</p>
<p>Council members in Warren, a working class city north of Detroit, are no strangers to controversy. In the past, they have made obscene finger gestures and challenged each other to fights. Last November, Warren Mayor Mark Steenbergh was charged with ethnic intimidation and assault following an altercation with a black teenager.</p>
