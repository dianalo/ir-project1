<p>Nearly two years after a huge bomb destroyed the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, a disgruntled Gulf War veteran goes on trial on Monday accused of carrying out the worst bomb attack on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>The first task facing U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch and opposing lawyers is to select 12 impartial jurors and six alternates to sit in judgment over Timothy McVeigh, 28, who could be sentenced to death if found guilty of bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal building on April 19, 1995.</p>
<p>McVeigh, from the small town of Pendleton in western New York state, was a model soldier. He was awarded a Bronze Star for Gulf War service before he left the Army in December 1991, disappointed by his failure to qualify for the Special Forces.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege McVeigh and former Army buddy Terry Nichols, who they say shared strong right-wing, anti-government views, used a rented truck packed with fertiliser and fuel oil to bomb the federal building.</p>
<p>They say the two men wanted to avenge the raid by federal agents on the Branch Davidian sect's compound at Waco, Texas, that led to the deaths of about 80 people on April 19, 1993, exactly two years before the Oklahoma City blast. Both have pleaded not guilty. Nichols will be tried separately later.</p>
<p>The federal courthouse in Denver, where the trial was moved because of concerns McVeigh could not receive a fair trial in Oklahoma City, has been turned into a fortress. Concrete barriers ring the building and surveillance cameras scan the outside. City officials said extra police protection for the expected four-month trial will cost about $500,000.</p>
<p>Hundreds of grieving relatives of the bombing victims and many of the more than 500 people injured in the blast have been eager for the trial to get under way. Twelve seats for victims have been set aside in the Denver courtroom, while other victims and relatives will watch the proceedings in Oklahoma City on closed-circuit television.</p>
<p>Several thousand journalists have been accredited to cover the trial, but television cameras and radio microphones are barred from the courtroom.</p>
<p>McVeigh was moved before dawn on Saturday from a federal prison in suburban Denver to the courthouse, where an area has been prepared for him to live during the trial, law enforcement sources said.</p>
<p>The trial will go ahead as scheduled despite claims by McVeigh's lawyers that he cannot get a fair trial because of news reports -- denied by lead defence attorney Stephen Jones -- that McVeigh confessed to his lawyers that he was responsible for the bombing.</p>
<p>McVeigh's lawyers said in court papers last week that their review of questionnaires completed by prospective jurors had confirmed their worst fears about pre-trial publicity. The outcome of the trial had been &quot;preordained,&quot; they said in asking the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to delay the trial to allow the effects of the publicity to die down.</p>
<p>&quot;The answers to the questions contained within the juror questionnaire demonstrate that Mr. McVeigh will be convicted and sentenced to death because the minds of prospective jurors have been irreversibly poisoned against him,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>The appeals court on Friday rejected Jones's attempts to have the trial postponed on publicity and other grounds.</p>
<p>In February, Matsch sent surveys to 1,000 prospective jurors in Denver and 22 surrounding counties. About 500 were called to a meeting this month where they filled in a second questionnaire.</p>
<p>Prospective jurors will be asked about their views and knowledge of the case this week as the jury pool is whittled down. Jury selection is expected to take several weeks.</p>
<p>Legal experts predict prosecutors will base their case against McVeigh on extensive physical evidence and records and witnesses to show he rented the truck used in the bombing.</p>
<p>McVeigh's lawyers are expected to say the government has the wrong man. They have suggested that a foreign government, possibly Iraq, may have planned the bombing.</p>
