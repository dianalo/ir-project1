<p>The Italian government risks being trapped into pushing the lira back into the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) at too high a rate, the president of the employers' federation Confindustria said on Friday.</p>
<p>Giorgio Fossa told reporters that foreign countries might be purposefully pushing the lira higher to boost the competitiveness of their own domestic industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The government risks falling into a trap,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps...even other countries are pushing the lira to levels which are favourable (for them).&quot;</p>
<p>The lira tumbled out of the ERM in 1992 and lost significant ground against a basket of European currencies in the subsequent fall-out. However it has regained strength over the past year and the government wants to put it back in the ERM by year end.</p>
<p>Fossa said he thought that the central parity rate for the lira should be somewhere between 1,000 to 1,100 against the German mark. The lira is currently trading around 995 lire.</p>
<p>&quot;It should certainly not go back in at 950. Italy is already in difficulty and that level would bring it to its knees,&quot; he added. The lira has recently slipped into a range just below the 1,000 level against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The lira is now certainly over-valued,&quot; Fossa said. Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio said on Thursday he thought the lira was at roughly the right level.</p>
<p>Fossa added that the current ERM bands were too wide, and said even if the central parity of the lira was fixed at 1,000 to the mark, it could still move to the 1,150 level without being forced out of the currency grid.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is important that once we are back in (the ERM), we shouldn't immediately move out to the extremes,&quot; he said. -- Crispian Balmer +396 6782501</p>
