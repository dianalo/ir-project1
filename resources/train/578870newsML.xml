<p>Brazil was rocked by a fresh corruption scandal on Tuesday when a newspaper alleged five congressmen took bribes to vote in favour of a bill allowing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to stand for re-election.</p>
<p>Daily Folha de Sao Paulo published details of a taped telephone conversation attributed to Ronivon Santiago, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and an unidentified person in which Santiago allegedly told how he received $188,000 for his vote.</p>
<p>In the purported recordings, Santiago allegedly said the governors of Acre and Amazonas states, Oleir Cameli and Amazonino Mendes, paid off another four deputies so they would vote in favour of the bill.</p>
<p>The bill would allow Brazil's president, governors and mayors to run for a second consecutive term. It was approved in the Chamber of Deputies in January and is currently awaiting a vote in a Senate committee.</p>
<p>Two of the five lawmakers mentioned in the report strongly denied any wrongdoing in speeches made in the lower house of Congress. &quot;I will not accept this treatment,&quot; said deputy Zila Bezerra, who complained she was being hounded by the press. &quot;I demand respect. I have not been convicted of anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Acre governor Cameli also issued a statement denying the report while a spokesman for Amazonas state government said Mendes was on an official visit to Ukraine and was unable to comment.</p>
<p>A spokesman at the presidential palace said the allegations would be investigated. &quot;The president had absolutely no knowledge of these allegations and he considers them to be serious,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>But Cardoso, who wants to stand in next year's presidential elections, rejected demands from left-wing opposition parties that further voting on the re-election bill be suspended. &quot;There is no reason at all why the re-election bill should be put on hold,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>A Congress official said an internal inquiry had been set up to investigate the Folha de Sao Paulo allegations and would make its findings known within a week.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, the Senate panel mulling the reform suspended its activities for 24 hours amid an outcry over the report. Left-wing lawmakers began gathering signatures for a petition calling for a wide-ranging parliamentary inquiry into the allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;The re-election bill itself is now under suspicion. We believe it should be put on hold until the facts have been completely cleared up,&quot; said Jose Machado, leader in the Chamber of Deputies of the leftist Workers Party (PT).</p>
<p>A Senate commission is currently investigating an alleged, multi-million-dollar scam involving municipal bonds, the latest in a string of corruption scandals to rock Congress since former president Fernando Collor stood down in disgrace in 1992.</p>
