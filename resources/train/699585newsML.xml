<title>USA: NY precious metals called to open mixed.</title>
<headline>NY precious metals called to open mixed.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were called to open mixed Tuesday, with the pressure remaining on gold and silver as the dollar firmed against most major currencies for a third session overnight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile platinum group metals (PGMs) were expected to open higher after Russia failed to meet another self-imposed deadline for resuming exports.</p>
<p>COMEX August gold was called unchanged to off $0.30 from Monday's close of $335.30 an ounce after trading from $335.40 to $334.60 on ACCESS.  </p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $333.80/$334.30 early against the London morning fix of $333.60 - a fresh four-year low. In New York Monday, spot gold ended quoted at $333.70/$334.20.</p>
<p>Commodity fund selling accelerated last week as the four year low at $336.00, seen in January this year, came under pressure again, while Australian gold miners took advantage of a slide in the Australian dollar to hedge their positions by selling more gold forward, bullion dealers said.</p>
<p>COMEX gold stocks were unchanged at 844,994 ounces Tuesday, while COMEX silver stocks rose 215,492 ounces to 185,528,996 ounces.</p>
<p>COMEX September silver was called unchanged to up 0.50 cent from Monday's close of $4.648 after trading between $4.680 and $4.650 on ACCESS.</p>
<p>NYMEX October platinum was called up $2.00 to $3.00 from the previous close of $412.80, with NYMEX September palladium expected to open up $1.00 to $2.00 from $174.90 yesterday.</p>
