<p>Veteran Italian maestro Francesco Rosi entered &quot;The Truce&quot; in the Cannes festival competition on Tuesday after a 10-year struggle to film the odyssey of Holocaust survivor Primo Levi.</p>
<p>John Turturro, who won the Cannes Golden Palm for best actor in &quot;Barton Fink&quot;, plays Levi as he emerges, racked by scarlet fever and almost mute, from the Auschwitz concentration camp and zig-zags home to Turin through a Europe devastated by war.</p>
<p>&quot;I first thought of doing the film in 1987. I called Primo Levi, I asked him for the book, he was happy to give it to me,&quot; said the 74-year-old Rosi, most of whose films including &quot;Lucky Luciano&quot; and &quot;Carmen&quot; have run in Cannes.</p>
<p>&quot;We spoke on the phone for half an hour. A week later he died tragically (by committing suicide). I was traumatised,&quot; Rosi told a news conference.</p>
<p>A year and two films later, Rosi obtained the rights to the story but producers in Italy and abroad kept telling him: &quot;But nothing happens in this book.&quot; Fellow-director Martin Scorsese helped save the project in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Despite some emotional scenes, the film falls far short of Levi's classic, and loses much of the author's moral outlook as he and a band of survivors rediscover a desire to live on a nine-month journey home.</p>
<p>Industry bible Variety criticised the film as a &quot;pedestrian adaptation condensing Levi's experience into an episodic series of picaresque and poignant vignettes that fails to convey the vast human canvas or the emotional impact of (the book).&quot;</p>
<p>Turturro, who had not previously read Levi's works, was picked after Rosi saw &quot;Barton Fink&quot; in Cannes.</p>
<p>&quot;'The Truce' is the kind of film that you could never make in Hollywood,&quot; the actor said. &quot;We discussed it even before there was a script. It was one of the hardest things I have attempted to do.&quot;.</p>
<p>Levi was a partisan during World War Two and wrote &quot;If This is a Man&quot; just after his release from Auschwitz. He published &quot;The Truce&quot; in 1963.</p>
<p>Wary of cliches and eager to differentiate his films from Holocaust movies such as &quot;Shoah&quot; and &quot;Schindler's List&quot;, Rosi highlighted Levi's account as based on the death camps but focusing on a subsequent &quot;return to life&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;When I thought of making the film for the first time, people were no longer speaking about the Holocaust. It's very important to return to the theme of suffering and horror, because this horror of the concentration camp has been repeated around the world,&quot; Rosi said.</p>
<p>In a 50th anniversary festival dominated by dark tales and thrillers, zany Australian director Stephan Elliott will screen &quot;Welcome to Woop Woop&quot; at a special midnight showing on Tuesday, a surreal package about a New York hustler who wanders into deepest Australia.</p>
<p>Elliott, maker of &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; about a band of drag queens and their journey across the continent, twisted the original script for a black comedy &quot;to a much more funny way rather than a cruel way of looking at (Australia)&quot;.</p>
