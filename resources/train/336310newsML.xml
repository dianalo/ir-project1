<p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is likely to remain wary about carrying out sustained dollar selling intervention in currency markets out of concern for the limited durability of such action and the consequences of dollar-asset sales,  Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd said in a recent report.</p>
<p>It said the effect of dollar-selling and yen-buying intervention would be limited unless accompanied by a change in monetary policy. Economic fundamentals indicated that the current situation of yen weakness was likely to persist for some time, it added.</p>
<p>Dollar-selling and yen-buying operations decrease the amount of yen capital available in the market, which has the effect of driving up Japanese interest rates.</p>
<p>In the last period of heavy dollar-selling intervention, from the second quarter 1989 to the first quarter of 1991, the real call rate rose to 6.0 from 2.3 percent, the report said.</p>
<p>But with the Japanese government concerned about fiscal contraction and an anticipated slowdown in corporate earnings, there was little prospect of higher interest rates in the near future, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The effects of intervention are therefore likely to be limited and short-lived,&quot; the report said.  </p>
<p>Japan's official discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>Dollar-selling intervention would necessitate the sale of U.S. government bonds from Japan's foreign exchange reserve, the report said. Considering the high level of holdings Japanese monetary authorities have in U.S. treasuries -- about five percent of outstanding U.S. bonds, with a bias towards the short end -- this could have a significant impact on the U.S. bond market, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest employment statistics have made the U.S. bond market nervous about monetary tightening, and dollar asset sales would aggravate this sentiment. This, in turn, could have repercussions for Japan's financial markets if U.S. long rates start rising,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can only conclude that the BOJ will be wary of a sustained policy of reverse intervention, given the limited duration of the results, and the consequences of the necessary dollar asset sales,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said that while the likelihood of intervention rises as the dollar moves towards 120 yen, Japanese monetary authorities may be expected to conduct nothing more than smoothing operations designed to exert a near-term moderating influence.</p>
