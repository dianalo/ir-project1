<p>U.S. millfeed prices remained mostly steady to weaker on Wednesday, weighed down by slackened demand in several locations, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Product is down,&quot; a Carolinas dealer said, noting that cheaper substitutes, such as hominy gluten feed and soy hulls, were working their way into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the problem still is that we do not have any flour mills running very well,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Runs are reduced and merchandisers are trying to get what small amount of supplies are available to cover their sales, the Carolinas dealer said. Merchandisers buy from flour mills and sell to feed mills.</p>
<p>Another dealer said there was a little bit of spot buying into next week. &quot;The market was completely dead for two days. We had a little bit of fill-in (buying) but nothing too dramatic one way or the other,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he expects to see little excess feed available at least for next week due to the approach of the Easter holiday.</p>
