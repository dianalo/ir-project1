<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks close down, hit by profit taking.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks close down, hit by profit taking.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-01-23</dateline>

<p>Thai stocks fell sharply in the afternoon session on Thursday as investors took profit in bank and finance stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>The SET index fell 9.80 points, or 1.14 percent, to close at 849.17 on a turnover of 4.67 biilion baht ($186.8 million). The SET 50 fell 0.79 points to 63.73.</p>
<p>Modest morning gains had sent the index to its highest intraday level for more than a month and the temptation to take profit as the market struggled to build on recent gains was overwhelming, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was profit taking after recent gains, and some switching from finance and banks and into energy,&quot; said Vason Thangkavivit, head of research at Pacific Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>Falling prices of shares of the country's four largest commercial banks, and a 3.43 percent decline in the finance sector, outweighed a 2.96 percent gain in energy stocks.</p>
<p>New net settlement rule had minimal impact on liquidity in the falling market, where volume dropping to a three-day low.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't seem to help very much, no one wants to use it when the market is going down,&quot; Vason said.  </p>
<p>Though sentiment has improved since the release of fourth quarter results, Thursday's selling momentum was expected to carry over into early morning trade on Friday, Vason said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it should be sideways down tomorrow on the momentum from today, and over the next two weeks I think we could see volumes decline before the Chinese New Year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Resistance can be expected if the market approaches 870 or 900 over that period, he said.</p>
<p>Siam Commercial Bank shares were most actively traded but lost seven baht to 172, Cogeneration ended unchanged at 98 and PTTEP put on 18 to end at an all time high of 410.</p>
