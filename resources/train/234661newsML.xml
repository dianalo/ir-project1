<headline>Pakistan court says PM's advice on judges binding.</headline>
<dateline>ISLAMABAD 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the president must accept the prime minister's advice when appointing senior judges, the official news agency APP reported.</p>
<p>The ruling effectively upheld ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's contention that a premier's advice was binding.</p>
<p>But the court, in a short order, said that the prime minister's advice should be accepted on condition that the premier had consulted the chief justice of Pakistan and chief justice of each concerned high court on judicial appointments.</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari, who sacked Bhutto's government and dissolved the National Assembly (lower house) on November 5, had asked the Supreme Court to clarify the constitutional position.</p>
<p>Bhutto tangled with the Supreme Court in March when it ruled that the recommendations of the chief justices on judicial appointments should be accepted unless the president or executive branch produced sound reasons for rejecting them.</p>
<p>Opposition parties had accused Bhutto of packing the senior judiciary with political appointees. She denied the charge.</p>
<p>Leghari said in his proclamation dismissing Bhutto that she had set out to undermine and ridicule the superior judiciary, citing her alleged reluctance to implement the Supreme Court's ruling, which involved removing several judges she had named.</p>
<p>Bhutto and the speaker of the National Assembly have filed separate petitions to the Supreme Court asking it to overturn Leghari's action and reinstate the government and lower house.</p>
<p>Leghari, a former close political associate of Bhutto, used controversial constitutional powers he once swore he would never deploy to remove a democratically elected government.</p>
