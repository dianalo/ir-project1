<p>TOP STORIES - Corruption allegations will be raised by the opposition in a parliamentary motion on the government's actions in the Nong Ngu Hao airport affair. Jurin Laksanavisit, the Democrat MP who chairs the opposition co-ordinating committee, says the motion will seek explanations from the prime minister and other officials. Uncertainty over the project has damaged the country's image and caused confusion among investors, he says. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- The government has set up seven committees to address more than 100 problems presented by thousands of villagers who have gathered outside Government House. The committees were set up as a result of yesterday's meeting between core members of the protest group and government representatives. However, the leaders of the Assembly of the Poor, which organised the protest, say the villagers will continue to camp outside Government House until concrete action is taken.
