<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Buy Courts - Schroders.</headline>

<p>Schroders Securities has put furniture retailer Courts Singapore Ltd on its recommended buy list on the back of a recovery in sales.</p>
<p>In a report dated March 31 when Court shares were at Singapore $1.80, Schroders said the company had regained its market leadership position by being competitive in credit sales.</p>
<p>Court shares were untraded on Monday. Its previous close was S$1.90.</p>
<p>&quot;Weak first half results which suggested a structural decline in the company's business have been reversed, and we are confident the company will achieve 15 percent-plus earnings  </p>
<p>growth over the next few years,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Courts is the largest furniture retailer in Singapore with more than 225,000 sq ft of retail space spread over 10 stores. It caters mainly to lower income groups and sales are mainly on credit terms.</p>
<p>Schroders said the downside risks to Courts were limited with the stock trading at a four-year price earnings ratio low.</p>
<p>It said Courts would be rerated upwards when its 1997 financial results are released in May which would show a strong recovery in sales in the second half of its financial year.  </p>
<p>Schroders said despite its projected seven percent fall in 1997 earnings, it expected the stock to outperform the market significantly when investors rerate the company upwards.</p>
