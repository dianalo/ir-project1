<p>Japan expects its economic recovery to stay on track in the next fiscal year, with growth of just under two percent, the government said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Economic Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso said Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow around 1.9 percent in fiscal 1997/98 -- the lowest official forecast in four decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth may slow in the first half of 1997/98 due to a rise in the consumption tax, but Japan can achieve a sustainable recovery in the whole fiscal year,&quot; Aso told reporters.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita echoed that sentiment, telling a news conference on Wednesday that Japan's economic recovery was getting firmer.</p>
<p>The BOJ has kept interest rates at record low levels for more than a year to support the recovery.</p>
<p>Private economists -- some more bearish and some more bullish -- agreed the government's official outlook was a nod to the impact of fiscal tightening as Japan tries to get its huge budget deficit under control.</p>
<p>&quot;This time instead of expressing how economic policy ought to be, we decided on figures that are possible to achieve,&quot; EPA Vice Minister Shinpei Nukaya told reporters.</p>
<p>The government also predicted the unemployment rate would be at about 3.3 percent in 1997/98, a shade below the record 3.5 percent seen last summer.</p>
<p>The surplus in the nation's current account -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services -- was forecast to fall to about 6.9 trillion yen ($61 billion) against a revised forecast of 7.0 trillion yen ($61.9 billion) in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Authorities confirmed an earlier forecast of GDP growth of 2.5 percent this business year to next March, a prediction economists say stands a good chance of being achieved.</p>
<p>Government forecasts have not, however, always been in touch with reality.</p>
<p>During the economic slump which followed the collapse of Japan's late 1980s &quot;bubble&quot; of soaring asset prices, authorities set forecasts at above achievable levels to avoid admitting the need for deficit financing to support huge stimulative packages, economists said.</p>
<p>Private forecasts for 1997/98 range from under one percent to over two percent, with economists polled by Reuters expecting, on average, GDP growth of around 1.6 percent.</p>
<p>Behind the range of outlooks are differing views over how much impact future fiscal tightening will have, with some arguing for harsher effects while others say companies and consumers have already discounted the fallout.</p>
<p>Japan's three percent sales tax will rise to five percent from next April 1, special income tax cuts are all but certain to end this year, and public works spending will be pared back.</p>
<p>The government's official forecasts appeared to split the difference nicely.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the main message is that the tax hikes will slow the economy, but not so much,&quot; said Jeff Young, an economist at Salomon Brothers Asia. &quot;They are trying to give a nod to reality, but also say the overall economy is not so bad...and is good enough to keep the unemployment rate stable.&quot;</p>
<p>While economists welcomed the relative realism of the government's growth forecast, some said the predicted dip in Japan's current account surplus was too optimistic.</p>
<p>Data released separately on Wednesday showed Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus rose marginally in November, the first increase in two years. Economists had expected the surplus, which has been declining, to start growing sometime next year, but were surprised at the early increase. ($1=113 yen)</p>
