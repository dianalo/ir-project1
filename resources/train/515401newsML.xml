<p>SIMEX Nikkei 225 June futures got a boost from Wall Street and broke key resistance of 18,000 in the first-half trading session on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market attempted to break 18,000 several times on Tuesday but failed.</p>
<p>&quot;Dow's 135 points rise overnight gave the initial boost to break 18,000,&quot; a dealer with a European institution said.</p>
<p>&quot;After that was breached, several buy-stop orders were triggered and pushed the Nikkei up to 18,140,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At 0250 GMT, June was at 18,035 against its previous close of 17,945. Turnover was light at 4,265 lots.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the Niikei remained underpinned by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) governor's assurance that he has no intention of changing its accommodative money policy in the near future.</p>
<p>The comments were reinforced by the BOJ's money operations on Tuesday when it drained 400 billion yen from the market against an estimated 510 billion yen surplus, dealers said.</p>
<p>The April MSCI Taiwan index contract was trading around 360.1 against its previous close at 359.2. Turnover was at 489 lots.</p>
