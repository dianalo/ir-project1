<p>Tokyo stocks are expected to hover in a range from 21,500 to 22,000 in the coming week, as investors wait for a new government to draw up economic policies after Sunday's general election, brokers said.</p>
<p>Most market participants hope the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the strongest party in the previous coalition, will secure a clear majority of seats in the polls for the Lower House of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Political leadership has been weak for the past couple of years and anything is better than the current state,&quot; said Akishige Ishikura, an analyst at Daiichi Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The market thinks economic and administrative reforms, as well as deregulation measures, have a better chance of getting done under LDP supervision,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Newspaper opinions polls have forecast that the LDP will win a simple majority of at least 251 seats in the key Lower House. Members serve four years but the prime minister can dissolve the house any time.</p>
<p>If the forecasts of a LDP win hold up, it would be a remarkable comeback by the party, which has steadily built itself up since 1993, when it lost power for the first time in 38 years because of a series of financial scandals.</p>
<p>It clawed its way into a coalition government one year after the setback, but with only 211 seats in the previous parliament, had to share power with two smaller parties.</p>
<p>Brokers said institutional investors were active in the market on Friday in anticipation of the elections. They helped push the key Nikkei 225 index past two fierce resistance levels -- the end-September closing high of 21,556 and 21,603, a recent intra-day high. They said the next notch was 22,000.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Nikkei ended 188.56 points, or 0.88 percent, higher at 21,612.30. It rose more than 640 points in the course of a week.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some investors out there who are really optimistic about the polls,&quot; a broker at a medium-sized securities house said.</p>
<p>But despite the optimism of domestic investors, foreign investors are likely to remain spectators until the Japanese political picture becomes clearer and policies are outlined, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said foreigners were not likely to start buying Japanese stocks aggressively until the U.S. market bull run started to calm down.</p>
<p>Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia, said an LDP victory would be welcomed by financial markets, but stocks may not post further gains as they had risen in advance.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has largely discounted the LDP victory now -- that is not news any more,&quot; he said. &quot;We may see it move in the opposite direction.&quot;</p>
<p>Masaaki Higashida, a strategist at Nomura Securities, said the impact of the election results was likely to be short-lived.</p>
<p>He said that with the exception of Shinshinto's (New Frontier Party) opposition to a rise in the consumption tax, party policies were basically the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than who wins the elections, what the market cares about is what the new government will do,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The main opposition group, Shinshinto, has pledged that if it wins the election, it will delay an unpopular plan to increase Japan's consumption tax to five percent from the current three percent.</p>
<p>The increase is scheduled to take effect from April.</p>
