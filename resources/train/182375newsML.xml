<p>Argentine President Carlos Menem Tuesday dismissed charges by his former Economy Minister Domgino Cavallo that he was led astray by corrupt friends and presidential hangers on.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what personal friends he is referring to,&quot; Menem told local radio, describing Cavallo's remarks as &quot;hasty&quot;.</p>
<p>Menem added, &quot;If it is the case that some people have committed acts of corruption, then those who should judge are the courts.&quot;</p>
<p>At a news conference late Monday to announce he wanted to be president, Cavallo said that Menem was being misled by corrupt members of his entourage &quot;who whisper into his ear and call themselves his friends, who have tried to use him to do business for themselves or have done corrupt business.&quot;</p>
<p>The president sacked Cavallo in July after a long series of clashes by the minister with traditionalist members of Menem's Peronist Party to opposed to free market policies, and also spectacular accusations of official corruption.</p>
<p>Cavallo returned to politics vowing to crusade against corruption and accused two cabinet ministers of manipulating judges and trying to impede corruption investigations.</p>
