<p>The number of Americans filing for personal bankruptcy is expected to reach an all-time high of one million in 1996, a banking group said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are on a pace to have over one million personal bankruptcies filed this year for the first time in U.S. history,&quot; American Bankers Association chief economist James Chessen told the House Banking Committee.</p>
<p>Chessen also noted that rising U.S. consumer credit delinquencies have triggered concern in the industry, but he said they &quot;do not pose a serious threat&quot; to the financial condition of banks.  </p>
<p>Consumer credit card delinquencies have climbed steadily over the past one-and-a-half years and the trend is likely to continue for the next quarter, the banking group predicted.</p>
<p>Delinquencies have reached a level previously seen only during recessions.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we are not in a recession now, which makes the current high level of credit card delinquencies more troublesome,&quot; Chessen said.</p>
<p>A Visa USA Inc. official, also testifying before Congress, urged lawmakers to &quot;act decisively&quot; to address issues raised by the wave of bankruptcy filings.</p>
<p>During the first half of 1996, personal bankruptcy filings in the United States jumped by 26 percent over the same period a year earlier. Bank credit card losses &quot;will continue to grow unless problems with the Bankruptcy Code are addressed,&quot; said Kenneth Crone, vice president of risk management at VISA.</p>
<p>&quot;Bankruptcy no longer appears to carry the social stigma it once did,&quot; making it far easier for consumers to wipe out their debt,&quot; Crone maintained.</p>
