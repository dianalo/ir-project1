<p>Top American businessmen said on Monday they opposed sanctions against military-ruled Burma and called the Southeast Asian policy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; the right way to push Rangoon towards democracy.</p>
<p>United Technologies Corp chief George David said the Americans and their Southeast Asian counterparts agreed after a one-day meeting that unilateral sanctions on Burma would be wrong.</p>
<p>Most of the Americans, including heads of some of the country's biggest corporations, said the idea of sanctions should be shunted aside in favour of pressing Burma towards democracy from the inside.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that the policy of engagement is a better way to produce change. We're better off having engagement, participation and investments,&quot; David told reporters, who asked whether profit was the only motive.</p>
<p>&quot;I would certainly reject that,&quot; said David, chairman of the U.S./ASEAN Business Council that brought some 50 top American executives to Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the way you induce changes is by participation and by engagement, not by punishment or sanctions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>David said he expected Burma, along with Laos and Cambodia, to join ASEAN this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that would be terrific,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It has agreed Burma should join at the same time as Laos and Cambodia, resisting Western pressure to keep Rangoon at arm's length.</p>
<p>It says &quot;constructive engagement&quot; -- maintaining normal ties while pushing for change -- is the correct approach.</p>
<p>American executives who spoke to reporters all endorsed that policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a constructive engagement is much more important for the U.S. We shouldn't lose what little influence we do have by pulling out,&quot; said former treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen.</p>
<p>He called Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has called repeatedly for sanctions on Rangoon, a remarkable person, but said he did not agree with her.</p>
<p>&quot;I sympathise with her problem. However, we are a nation and we can't govern by the ideas and the recommendations of one person. I don't agree with her,&quot; Bentsen said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to look to see what we can do to liberalise the situation in Burma and protect people like her,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Walter Shorenstein, chairman of the Shorenstein Company, one of the largest privately held U.S. real estate firms, said engagement made good sense.</p>
<p>&quot;It is necessary for us to know more about each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Former secretary of state Alexander Haig was trenchant in his opposition to sanctions of any kind, calling them a &quot;very short-sighted approach&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's arrogant, it's wrong-headed and it misreads the lessons of history,&quot; Haig, president of consultants Worldwide Associates Inc, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Every analysis I have seen suggests that not only do sanctions not work, but they frequently, especially in democratic societies, create obstacles for the incumbent leaders of those societies to make the changes we want,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Haig told a news conference some of the international pressure for sanctions against Burma was the result of &quot;knee-jerk populism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The real issue is how do you make the situation better, not how do you feel good at home or how do you keep the press happy,&quot; he said.</p>
