<p>Peru moved on Friday to improve the deteriorating health of 72 hostages held by guerrillas as the Peruvian and Japanese leaders prepared for a weekend summit to map out a strategy to end the 45-day crisis.</p>
<p>A medical team visited the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence, seized by Marxist rebels on Dec. 17, and took blood samples from the hostages for analysis.</p>
<p>The tests were to help &quot;improve knowledge of the hostages' health,&quot; Red Cross spokeswoman Cecile Baux said.</p>
<p>In another sign that authorities expected the hostage crisis to drag on, Red Cross workers took about 70 thin matresses into the building. Most hostages have slept on the floor since the start of the crisis.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori, who meets Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for talks in Toronto on Saturday to discuss plans to end the siege, said before he left that the crisis could continue for weeks or months.</p>
<p>Hashimoto paid what Japanese officials described as a &quot;courtesy visit&quot; to Fujimori on Friday night, lasting one hour. No details of their conversation were available.</p>
<p>The improved medical surveillance follows growing concern about the health of the captives, most of whom are middle-aged men. Aid workers and police say hostages are being treated for hypertension, gastric problems and stress.</p>
<p>The rebels have released two police commanders since Jan. 17 to receive medical attention.</p>
<p>Following the Jan. 25 release of deputy police chief Gen. Jose Rivas Rodriguez, the government said it would set up a specialised medical team to track the hostages' health.</p>
<p>But the MRTA's international spokesman, Isaac Velazco, warned on Friday that the hostages were more susceptible to the difficult conditions inside the residence than the jungle-trained rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;We are used to this type of situation. The others (hostages) inside are not,&quot; Velazco told Reuters in an interview from Hamburg.</p>
<p>&quot;We have patience, serenity and all the time in the world to reach a political agreement,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Velazco urged Hashimoto to convince Fujimori to seek a quick political solution.</p>
<p>He said Fujimori was playing a dangerous game by suggesting he could wait months rather than give in to the rebels' demand to free 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>Hashimoto told reporters accompanying him to Toronto on Friday he would ask Fujimori to start negotiations with the MRTA.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think opening a dialogue means giving in to terrorism,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But in an interview with Argentina's Clarin newspaper published on Friday, Fujimori indicated his position was hardening as the crisis dragged on.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to give in to the terrorists' demands. As time goes by, offers made by the government are being progressively reduced,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Police surrounding the building relaxed their psychological war of nerves with the rebels on Friday, limiting activities to just one early morning blast of military marching music at the residence.</p>
<p>The police tactics, which have included throwing garbage into the residence and flying helicopters overhead, have been gradually toned down since rebels shot at and narrowly missed police aboard an armoured vehicle convoy on Monday.</p>
<p>Following the shooting, Tokyo criticised Peru for endangering the lives of hostages -- including about two dozen Japanese diplomats and businessmen.</p>
<p>In the absence of government negotiator Domingo Palermo -- who accompanied Fujimori to Canada -- Presidential Minister Daniel Hokama was designated as the government's point man.</p>
<p>Hokama said a 24-hour hot line with trained psycholgists had been set up for relatives of the hostages.</p>
