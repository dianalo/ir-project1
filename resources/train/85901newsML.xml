<p>The dollar hit a 2-1/2 year high on Monday amid growing perceptions of slow Japanese economic growth and a widening U.S.-Japan interest rate gap.</p>
<p>Pro-dollar comments from officials at a meeting of Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington at the weekend also buoyed the U.S. unit.</p>
<p>&quot;The key factor is that against a background of a modest recovery in Japan, yields will remain low encouraging Japanese investors to move funds overseas,&quot; said Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said at the weekend he saw the Bank of Japan keeping its easy monetary stance to ensure the country's gradual economic recovery.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita also said the recent fall in long-term Japanese rates may reflect changes in sentiment towards Japan's economic prospects.</p>
<p>Currency analysts said pressure to increase U.S. rates will increase amid a strengthening U.S. economy, particularly after the Federal Open Market Committee's decision last week to keep rates steady.</p>
<p>This contrasts with the sluggish pace of the Japanese economic recovery where interest rates are expected to remain steady into the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>This was reflected on Monday when Tokyo released preliminary August industrial production data that showed output slipped 1.9 percent against an average forecast of a 1.5 percent decline.</p>
<p>The dollar traded up to a peak of 111.66 yen in Europe, levels not seen since since January 1994 and up from 110.78 in late European trade on Friday. By 1330 GMT it was off its peak at around 110.55.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of talk of a substantial amount of capital flowing out of Japan in the second half of the fiscal year which starts Tuesday,&quot; said a currency dealer at the German bank in London. &quot;Whether it will be the &quot;wall of money' people have been expecting remains to be seen, but it will certainly provide some dollar support.&quot;</p>
<p>Chartists said the next dollar/yen target is minor resistance at 111.80 yen before a major upside level of 113.58, its high from early January 1994.</p>
<p>The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates was also underpinning the dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. interest rates seem to be on an uptrend now coming into next year and the end of this year, whereas German rates are fixed or on a downward bias over this time horizon,&quot; said Shahab Jalinoos, bond analyst at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>The dollar against the mark tested briefly a fresh 2-1/2 month high of 1.5291 in Europe, clearing stiff chart resistance at 1.5280 marks. By 1330 GMT it had settled back to 1.5265 compared with late Friday's level of 1.5239.</p>
<p>The weekend G7 meeting yielded few surprises for currency markets but analysts said the upbeat tone towards the dollar's recent gains would be supportive for the U.S. unit.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar was given additional support at the G7 meeting with comments from Rubin and Tietmeyer and that's really given it some underlying support today,&quot; said DKB's Lyons.</p>
<p>Both Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said they favoured a strong dollar now and into the future.</p>
