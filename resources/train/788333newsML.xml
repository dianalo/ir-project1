<headline>NYMEX natgas seen reversing after week-long rally.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-08</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were expected to open lower Friday after a weaker ACCESS session and early talk of softer cash prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>September reversed its week-long trend in over-the-counter trade as prices ranged from $2.38 to $2.39 at 0935 EDT. It settled Thursday at $2.444 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>&quot;It's payback time,&quot; one trader said, noting record-low temperatures set in Texas Thursday, cool weather across many parts of the U.S. and softening power prices caused many traders to retreat ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, September last traded 0.9 cent lower at $2.433.</p>
<p>Early Friday cash prices at Henry Hub were talked lower at $2.36-2.385.</p>
<p>Technically, September support was pegged at $2.34, and then at $2.30 and $2.25-2.27. Resistance was seen at the contract high of $2.515, and then at the continuation gap between $2.64 and $2.89 from late January.</p>
<p>In Thursday's cash, Gulf Coast prices jumped more than a 10 cents to $2.47-2.52 at Henry Hub. Midcon pipes were up a similar amount to the low-$2.40s, while New York city gate gas climbed into the $2.60s, up more than 10 cents on the day.</p>
<p>Warmer temperatures are moving into most of the Northeast, Midwest and southern plains this weekend, with continued heat forecast to remain in parts of the Southwest. However, rains are continuing to suppress temperatures in northern and central Florida. By early next week, cooler temperatures are expected to return to parts of Texas, according to Weather Services Corp.</p>
