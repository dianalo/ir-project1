<p>Irish government bonds recouped some of the losses incurred after the release of key U.S. non-farm payrolls data in late trade on Friday and further improvements are seen, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Irish bonds were going along quite well this morning, particularly in the five-year area, but it all came to grief with the release of the U.S. employment numbers which sparked talk of a U.S. rate rise,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds here have started to pick up again since and I expect to see Europe, including Ireland, going ahead again next week,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>The U.S. data showed that 262,000 jobs were created outside the farm sector in December. Wall Street economists had on average forecast only 192,000 jobs would be created.</p>
<p>The closely-watched figures followed a string of data pointing to a strengthening of the U.S. economy, making an early rise in U.S. interest rates the Federal Reserve more likely.</p>
<p>By 1605 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down 20 pence from Thursday's close at 101.10 to yield 6.22 percent, having fallen to 100.95 after the release of the U.S. data.</p>
<p>The key eight percent bond due 2006 was down 35 pence from the close to 107.90 to yield 6.84 percent but above earlier lows.</p>
<p>Dealer said Irish bonds were trading 170 basis points over German bunds in the five-year area and 94 basis points over Germany in the 10-year area. --Damien Lynch, Dublin newsroom 353-1-661-3377</p>
