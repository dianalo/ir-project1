<title>ISRAEL: Israel's Sharansky postpones Moscow visit.</title>
<headline>Israel's Sharansky postpones Moscow visit.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1996-11-20</dateline>

<p>Former Soviet Jewish dissident Natan Sharansky has postponed his first visit to Russia since being freed in an East-West prisoner exchange because of a death in the family, his office said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sharansky, now Israel's trade and industry minister, hoped to use the seven-day visit, which had been scheduled to begin next week, to boost commercial ties between the Jewish state and Russia, Israel's ambassador to Moscow said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sharansky's ministry said he was forced to postpone the visit because of the sudden death of his wife's brother and had notified Russian authorities. A new date for the trip was not announced.</p>
<p>Postponement of the Sharansky visit also meant a 70-strong Israeli trade delegation due to accompany him would not be travelling to Moscow next week, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Sharansky, 48, spent nine years in Soviet prisons before being allowed to leave for Israel in an East-West prisoner swap in 1986.</p>
<p>He had been scheduled to meet senior Russian officials for talks on the sectors of telecommunications, agricultural technology and medical equipment.</p>
<p>At a news conference in Moscow before the announcement in Jerusalem, Israeli ambassador Aliza Shenar said bilateral trade, virtually non-existent five years ago, was now worth about $500 million and expanding fast.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov visited Israel last month and Moscow is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>Sharansky was a founder member of the unofficial human rights Helsinki Group. He first applied for an exit visa to Israel in 1973 but was refused for &quot;security reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>After his imprisonment in 1978 for alleged espionage his wife Avital waged an international campaign for his release that made him one of the Soviet Union's most celebrated dissidents in the West.</p>
<p>He was released from jail on February 11 1986. He arrived in Israel to a hero's welcome that same night.</p>
<p>Sharansky became a minister in right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government after his Yisrael ba-Aliya party won seven seats in parliament after May's elections.</p>
<p>Yisrael ba-Aliya, which means Israel on the Rise, draws support from more than half a million Jews who have immigrated from the former Soviet Union since the late 1980s.</p>
