<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos said on Saturday he bested his golfmates in the first game he played since major surgery two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I played golf this morning with the score better than the others,&quot; Ramos told reporters during a ground breaking ceremony for military housing. He played with three of his advisers.</p>
<p>Ramos underwent his second check-up on Friday afternoon and was pronounced by his doctor to be well enough to play golf.</p>
<p>&quot;The prognosis is very good,&quot; Ramos said, adding that his blood pressure and cholesterol levels were back to normal.</p>
<p>Ramos, 68, was operated on two weeks ago to remove a cholesterol blockage in his right carotid artery. Officials had said it could have been life-threatening if it was not removed.</p>
<p>Ramos has scaled down his schedule after his doctors asked him to slow down.</p>
