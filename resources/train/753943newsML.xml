<headline>Digital Q4 gross margins best in 3 years.</headline>

<p>Digital Equipment Corp said its gross margins improved in the fiscal fourth quarter to 34.6 percent of revenues, up from 32.6 percent a year earlier, and were its best in more than three years.</p>
<p>Fiscal third quarter gross margins were 33.4 percent, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;This reflects continuing improvments in product cost, productivity programs and mix,&quot; Digital Chief Financial Officer Vincent Mullarkey said in a statement.</p>
<p>Digital reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.75 a share, surpassing the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.73.  </p>
<p>Revenues for the quarter declined to $3.5 billion from $3.7 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the full year, Digital's revenues dropped to $13 billion from $14.6 billion in fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>Digital said product revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.0 billion, versus $2.1 billion a year ago. Product revenues were up nine percent from the third quarter, it said.</p>
<p>Service revenues were $1.5 billion, compared with $1.6 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>Product gross profit margins were 37.2 percent of revenues, compared with 34.3 percent a year ago.  </p>
<p>Product profit margins in the third quarter were 35.3 percent.</p>
<p>Service gross margins were 31.1 percent of revenues in the fourth quarter, up one percentage point from a year ago. Service margins were 31 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Digital said its personal computer business achieved a higher level of profit for the third straight quarter, continuing a significant turnaround from the third quarter of fiscal 1996, when it was hurt by significant price competition and high levels of inventory.  </p>
<p>&quot;The progress in our personal computer business has been excellent,&quot; said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Palmer.</p>
<p>Digital said the Windows NT segment grew about 50 percent from a year earlier, driven primarily by both Alpha and Intel servers. High-performance UNIX servers also experienced growth, and the company recorded strong growth in its storage business.</p>
<p>Digital said the quarter reflects its best inventory turns ever and the lowest accounts receivable days sales outstanding since the second quarter of fiscal 1995.</p>
<p>Digital said it ended the fourth quarter with $2.5 billion in cash. It said this represents an increase of $500 million over last year, while at the same time it repurchased four million shares of its common during the quarter.</p>
<p>Digital ended the quarter with about 54,900 employees, a reduction of 4,200 from the same period a year ago.</p>
