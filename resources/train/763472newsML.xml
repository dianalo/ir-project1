<p>Sri Lanka said on Tuesday that more than 4,000 army deserters had reported back for duty during an amnesty that ended last weekend.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry said in a statement that 4,206 of some 10,000 missing soldiers had returned to their regiments after the government extended by four days the amnesty that was originally due to end on July 21.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka had announced a crackdown on deserters earlier this month, but promptly followed with a general pardon on July 10, saying it was responding to appeals by parents who had asked that their children be given more time to return to their posts.</p>
<p>The statement said the military and civil police had been instructed to hunt for soldiers who were still missing.</p>
<p>&quot;On arrest, deserters will be tried by court martial with a view to punishing them severely,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>But it also said deserters who wished to report back could do so and they would be only charged for the lesser offence of absence without official leave.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankan military is fighting a 14-year-old war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which demand a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the Indian Ocean island's north and east.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, but the LTTE put the toll higher.</p>
