<p>Toronto stocks were expected to trade higher at the open on Monday, continuing Friday's bullish reversal after nearly a week of losses.</p>
<p>Analysts said the TSE will likely be the lone moving market today as Canadians head to the polls in what is expected to be a re-election of the Liberal majority government.</p>
<p>&quot;Friday the very bullish reversal in both the Dow and the TSE bode well for continued gains today...even though the other markets will probably be quiet ahead of tonight's results. I think we could get a nice 30 to 40 point bounce in the TSE,&quot; said technical analyst Katherine Beattie at MMS International.  </p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index reversed earlier losses on Friday to end on a firmer note, gaining 11.79 points to 6382.12.</p>
<p>Canada's largest equities market lost ground for most of the week after setting record highs on Monday. Overall the key index shed 57 points from Monday's open of 6441 points.</p>
<p>Beattie said markets were counting on the re-election today of a Liberal majority government and the Reform party to form the opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;So if we get that the market will continue higher. If we get a majority Liberal and by some miracle the (Conservatives) form the opposition, that would be very bullish and would keep the TSE higher,&quot; Beattie said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only negative would be if the Liberals did not get a majority. If they don't get a majority the Canadian dollar is going to drop overnight and that's going to put dramatic pressure on all our markets tomorrow,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Public opinion polls last week gave Prime Minister Jean Chretien's Liberals a commanding lead, followed by Reform and Conservatives in a dead heat for second place. Reform was expected to gather more seats based on a strong regional performance in Western Canada.</p>
<p>In economic news, Canada's real gross domestic product, at 1986 prices, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 1996, Statistics Canada said on Monday. It said the economy grew by 3.4 percent at an annualized rate in the quarter.</p>
<p>Canada had a current account deficit of C$1.221 billion in the first quarter, seasonally adjusted, compared to a sharply revised C$545 million (revised from C$1.703 billion) deficit in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>On a monthly basis, seasonally adjusted real GDP fell 0.3 percent in March after rising 0.5 percent in February.</p>
