<p>House Republicans concluded an hours-long private meeting on Monday to discuss the fate of embattled House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with party leaders predicting he would be re-elected speaker despite pending ethics charges.</p>
<p>Ohio Republican Rep. John Boehner, chairman of the House Republican conference, said Gingrich would be re-elected speaker Tuesday as scheduled. He said only a few Republicans spoke against Gingrich during the party meeting.  </p>
<p>&quot;I really do expect tomorrow that there will be no question that Newt Gingrich will be the first Republican speaker re-elected in 68 years,&quot; Boehner told a news conference at the conclusion of the 3 1/2-hour meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting was Gingrich's first face-to-face encounter with House Republicans since he admitted to violating ethics rules and providing false information to the House ethics committee. He answered questions and explained the case to his colleagues.</p>
<p>The ethics panel will not hold hearings on Gingrich or recommend a punishment until later in January, leaving Republicans in the postiion of having to decide whether to vote for him as speaker without a public airing of the case.</p>
<p>Four of the 227 House Republicans have publicly defected, saying they will not support Gingrich when the House votes on Tuesday. Some others had not decided. In a statement issued earlier, Rep. James Leach of Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said Gingrich was too tainted by ethics breaches to hold his post.</p>
