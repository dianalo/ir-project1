<p>Thai domestic soymeal prices will probably ease further after the government abolished import quotas and cut tariffs on soybeans, soymeal and fishmeal, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prices of meal in Bangkok started to ease this week following the arrival of three cargoes of low-protein Argentine soymeal at a price of around US$306-$307 a tonne C&amp;F Bangkok, dealers said.</p>
<p>Domestic soymeal was quoted at about 10.40 baht a kg from 10.45-10.50 baht a kg a week ago.  </p>
<p>Traders and industry sources said over 120,000 tonnes of soymeal were expected to arrive in Thiland between later this month and mid-November.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the government's 1996 low-tariff quota of 830,000 tonnes (of soymeal) was almost covered,&quot; one major Thai feed producer said. &quot;The supply would be enough to meet demand for the rest of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Another trader added that short-term demand for meal was easier because of slow demand in the pig and poultry industry. But orders are expected to pick up soon to cover early demand in 1997, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The import tariff on corn was sliced to zero from three percent. But the Thai government said corn imports will only be allowed between February 20 to June 30 to protect local farmers.</p>
<p>India-origin high-protein soymeal was quoted at around $310-$312 a tonne C&amp;F Bangkok. U.S. soymeal was quoted at $320-$325 a tonne C&amp;F while Brazilian meal was quoted just below $300 a tonne C&amp;F.</p>
<p>Corn, meanwhile, was reported to be steady on the back of ample supplies entering the market. Feed grade corn was quoted at 4.70-4.75 baht a kg, unchanged from last week.  </p>
<p>Corn prices in Indonesia, however, were riding high on the back of a pick up in demand from players who had washed out foreign contracts, traders said.</p>
<p>They also brushed aside rumours the government was considering a partial ban on corn imports from next year as it would be a step back in the country's deregulation process.</p>
<p>Traders said corn was around 415-420 rupiah a kg in Jakarta, up from 390-400 rupiah a week ago. Soymeal was steady at 850 rupiah a kg.  </p>
<p>&quot;Buying interest from Jakarta is increasing, causing prices to climb a little,&quot; one trader from the key growing region of Lampung in South Sumatra said.</p>
<p>A Jakarta trader said shipments of two Panamax vessels for November/December delivery were washed out, along with another for April/May delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;My estimate is that the washouts could total more than 150,000 tonnes of mostly U.S.-origin corn,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The buyers had purchased the corn on expectations that the bull run would continue well into the next year. The difference between their purchase and current prices is about $15 per tonne. It made sense to washout,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Another trader said the washouts could total up to 200,000 tonnes and involve three to four Panamax vessels.</p>
<p>He said he expected arrivals of between 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes of corn between now and January, mostly from the United States and Argentina and small amounts from Vietnam and India.</p>
<p>&quot;These are done deals,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Traders also said they did not give much weight to rumours that Jakarta might impose a partial ban on corn imports from next year because 456,150 hectares were going to be cultivated with the crop.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see that happening,&quot; one trader said. &quot;They have begun to deregulate the sector, I don't think they will now want to impose a partial ban. It's a pipedream.&quot;</p>
<p>Increasing land under corn cultivation is aimed at reducing the country's dependence on imported corn.  </p>
<p>Another trader said about 10,000-12,000 tonnes of Indian origin soymeal arrived last week, adding that he expected another 120,000 tonnes of mostly South American orgin to arrive through until January under previously signed contracts.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, buyers sat it out on expectations that grain prices will slide towards the end of the month, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices should be softer from early next month because futures have all gone down drastically,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>Traders could not report any sales since last Tuesday. One firm seeking 50,000 tonnes of corn for November shipment to trade in Malaysia has also deferred its order, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;A&quot; grade wheat in bags was trading at 840 ringgit a tonne ex-factory/godown central region. Low-grade wheat was quoted at 500-510 ringgit. Local soymeal was at 810 ringgit a tonne while imported soymeal was going for about 805-810 ringgit.</p>
<p>Bulk corn was trading at 500-510 ringgit.</p>
