<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Wednesday Germany would meet the 3.0 percent deficit target for European monetary union (EMU) as economic growth rebounds to 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>The government's official forecast for economic growth is 2.5 percent this year, up from 1.4 percent last year, but independent economists have suggested that this figure will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is how to solve the problems that arise when despite better economic growth -- and I think it is possible we will reach two-and-a-half percent -- tax revenues are lower and outlays for unemployment benefits are higher,&quot; Waigel said in a television interview taped for broadcast on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Journalists were permitted to observe the taping.</p>
<p>Waigel said he would seek further spending cuts rather than tax increases if Germany appeared in danger of missing the criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU), and that he could not exclude an across-the-board freeze on new spending.</p>
<p>&quot;We will fulfil the 3.0 percent criterion for Germany,&quot; Waigel said, adding that Bonn must take the political initiative for the euro even though polls show two-thirds of Germans do not want it.</p>
<p>&quot;If the euro fails, Germany will suffer the most,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty says that to qualify for European monetary unions, nations should reduce their public-sector deficits to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Although the treaty allows some leeway for countries close to the goal or moving in the right direction, Waigel is adamant that the criteria be strictly interpreted.</p>
<p>Separately, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said it was vital for EMU to start on time in 1999, and any delay could lead to &quot;irritations&quot; on international financial markets.</p>
<p>In a speech to bankers in Berlin, Rexrodt said the euro was needed to deepen European integration.</p>
<p>He said EMU was also vital to anchor the monetary stability already achieved by European countries, to boost competition, increase price transparency and cut business costs.</p>
<p>Waigel said his planned comprehensive tax reform was what Germany needed to stimulate investment and create new jobs, to shake the economy out of the doldrums.</p>
<p>He said opposition Social Democrats should stop dragging their feet on reforms of the tax and social security systems, which were indispensible for Germany to lower costs and regain its attractiveness to foreign investors, he said.</p>
