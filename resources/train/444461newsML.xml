<p>The trial of the doomsday cult guru accused of the Tokyo subway gassing was temporarily halted on Friday after his lawyers boycotted a hearing on the grounds that they had had insufficient time to prepare their case.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Fumihiro Abe cancelled the day's session when the lawyers did not appear with their client and criticised them for not fulfilling their &quot;social obligation&quot;.</p>
<p>The next session is scheduled for March 27.</p>
<p>Abe said: &quot;There is a lack of understanding between the presiding judge and the defence lawyers which is impeding the process of this trial. It is extremely regrettable that the defence have not appeared and are not fulfilling their social obligation as lawyers.&quot;</p>
<p>The boycott was the latest round in a row between the three-judge court and the 12 court-appointed defence lawyers over the pace of the trial of Shoko Asahara, leader of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect).</p>
<p>Asahara, who faces 16 charges, including murder in the March 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway, which killed 12 people and harmed 6,000 others, faces death by hanging if found guilty.</p>
<p>On Thursday, chief defence lawyer Osamu Watanabe said his team wanted the four-day-a-month trial cut by one day a month to allow more time to assemble evidence and reply to prosecution testimony.</p>
<p>Watanabe told reporters the team feared Asahara was being railroaded and at the current pace of proceedings the trial would inevitably end in the guru's conviction.</p>
<p>Under Japan's laborious legal system, where judges preside at several trials in the same week, Asahara's trial is already expected to take several years.</p>
<p>His defence lawyers say they are prepared to stick with the case for 10 years if it means the guru can get a fair hearing.</p>
<p>Asahara has not entered a plea to the charges against him. The court appointed lawyers to defend him when the guru fired his own team shortly after the trial started last April.</p>
<p>Prosecution lawyers joined the fray on Friday when they read a statement to the court condemning the defence team boycott.</p>
<p>&quot;We have tried to compromise with the defence team and have agreed to reduce the number of hearings from eight to six and then four times a month, but to no avail,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>When Abe told Asahara his trial could not go ahead, the guru replied: &quot;I understand what you said. Can I talk about the incident (subway attack) now?&quot;</p>
<p>Abe, who several times has thrown Asahara out of court for interrupting proceedings, tersely told him: &quot;That is not possible without the presence of your lawyers.&quot;</p>
