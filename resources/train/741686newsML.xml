<p>Time was running out on Sunday for any last-minute concessions from Boeing Co with the European Commission set to block on Wednesday the U.S. aircraft maker's proposed $14 billion merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp .</p>
<p>Boeing executive vice president Richard Albrecht met European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert on Friday evening but the two sides failed to break a deadlock.</p>
<p>&quot;He came empty-handed. He had nothing to offer,&quot; a Commission source told Reuters.</p>
<p>While the Commission says only a &quot;miracle&quot; will prevent the deal being blocked given the short deadline -- Monday is a bank holiday to celebrate Belgium's independence -- Boeing did not seem to be contemplating major concessions.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no meetings planned either at higher or lower level,&quot; Jim Frank, the company's vice president for European affairs, told Reuters on Sunday. Albrecht was expected to be &quot;wandering around&quot; until Wednesday, he said.</p>
<p>The Commission's determination to block the merger has triggered sharp criticism on the other side of the Atlantic and President Bill Clinton warned the United States might go to the World Trade Organisation or impose sanctions if this happened.</p>
<p>At stake in the EU-U.S. fight is a strategic industry representing $80 billion in sales worldwide, evenly distributed between defence and civilian aircraft markets.</p>
<p>The Commission believes the deal would strengthen Boeing's already dominant position in the commercial sector, a conclusion rejected by the manufacturer which argues McDonnell Douglas no longer constitutes a serious competitor.</p>
<p>Boeing's opinion was shared by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which cleared the merger earlier this month.</p>
<p>Despite intense political pressure, EU leaders have sided with the Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;Britain is under very strong pressure and so are France, Italy and Germany,&quot; an EU diplomat said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;They (British officials) may be quaking at the knees and there may be others who fear retaliation, but the procedure is under way. The Commission has competence to take a final decision.&quot;</p>
<p>The EU executive has the power to reject the deal if it finds it would harm fair competition in the 15-nation bloc. Were the merger to go ahead, it is empowered to impose fines of up to 10 percent of the companies' turnover.</p>
<p>The Commission maintains that the merged company would have a share of sales of commercial planes worldwide of 70 percent compared to Boeing's present 64 percent and a customer base of 84 percent from Boeing's 60 percent.</p>
<p>Although McDonnell Douglas has become a minor player in new orders from the commercial sector, its planes -- among them the successful 100-seater DC9 and its successor MD89 -- make up 25 percent of fleets worldwide.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas's strength in the military sector  causes the Commission to fear that Boeing would benefit from defence funds to subsidise its commercial programmes.</p>
<p>But the most contentious point in the talks between Boeing and the Commission remains exclusive supply contracts signed with large U.S. airlines AMR Corp's American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines.</p>
<p>The contracts, which last about 25 years, would shut off the airlines from Boeing's only other global rival Airbus Industrie -- the European consortium between France's Aerospatiale, Daimler-Benz Aerospsce, British Aerospace and Construccciones Aeronauticas of Spain.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Van Miert has called  the pacts &quot;unacceptable&quot;, but Boeing is only willing to cut them back to 13 years, EU sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not prepared to tear up the deals with the airlines,&quot; a source close to Boeing said.</p>
<p>Antitrust lawyers well versed in EU merger control law believe the two sides will come back to the negotiating table at a later stage even if the deal is prohibited on Wednesday.</p>
