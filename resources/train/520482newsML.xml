<p>Beijing will not swerve from its policy of trust and good-neighbourliness toward Russia, President Jiang Zemin said on Friday, speaking just days before he is to visit China's former socialist rival.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter how the world changes, China will not turn away from its policy of 'good-neighbourliness, equality and mutual trust, mutual beneficial co-operation, and common development' toward Russia,&quot; the Xinhua news agency quoted Jiang as telling visiting Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov.</p>
<p>Jiang said he was confident in the future of bilateral ties, Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>Rodionov, who arrived in China on Sunday for a five-day visit, has used his trip to defend Russia's arms sales to China, saying the weapons sold were defensive in nature and would not alter the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Jiang stressed the importance of developing a &quot;strategic co-operative partnership&quot; with Moscow for the 21st Century, a policy that has become a watchword in Sino-Russian ties since President Boris Yeltsin visited China last year.</p>
<p>&quot;China attaches great importance to Sino-Russian ties, and there are many prospects and great potential for cooperation in various fields,&quot; Jiang told his Russian visitor.</p>
<p>The new China-Russia relationship was significant to safeguard peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and for establishing a just and rational new world order, Jiang said.</p>
<p>Jiang is due to leave next Tuesday for a five-day visit to Moscow, where he will sign an accord with Russia's Yeltsin and leaders of the Central Asian states of Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on cutting military forces along the former Soviet-Chinese border.</p>
<p>Rodionov's visit was the latest sign of warming relations between the two countries, although diplomats have said that decades of mutual mistrust would prevent the creation of any new China-Russia axis.</p>
<p>Jiang's trip is aimed at building closer ties and would boost Russian efforts to strengthen relations in the East as it faces difficulties in relations with the West over NATO's plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>China and Russia formed a strong alliance in the early 1950s but it degenerated into bitter rivalry for leadership of the communist world and border clashes in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>Relations have been warming since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited Beijing in 1989.</p>
<p>Visits to China by Yeltsin in December 1992 and in April last year maintained the improvement in ties, and Jiang said last year that relations with Russia had entered a new age.</p>
