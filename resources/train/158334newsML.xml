<p>Discovery Petroleum NL said on Thursday the revised offer from Premier Oil Plc still undervalues its shares.</p>
<p>Premier earlier lifted its bid to 80 cents per Discovery share from 70 cents previously.</p>
<p>Discovery said it is still to formally make a recommendation on the offer.  </p>
<p>Discovery said its board of directors were considering Premier's revised offer, which values the oil producer at A$106.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the board notes that Premier's revised offer falls at the lower end of the Grant Samuel valuation range and is significantly below the mid-point of the valuation range,&quot; Discovery said.</p>
<p>&quot;The board of Discovery believes the revised offer still undervalues Discovery shares, as it does not fully reflect Discovery's future potential and its strategic importance to Premier,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>Discovery said at its annual meeting on Monday that it had recently made data available to Premier to allow the UK oil producer to verify publicly available information on Discovery. It said Premier has ended its review of this information. Oil Search Ltd, which has a 10.1 percent stake in Discovery, is also currently reviewing this information.</p>
<p>&quot;The board of Discovery will make a more detailed announcement early next week after fully considering Premier's revised offer. In the meantime, Discovery shareholders should not accept Premier's offer but await the board's advice.&quot;  </p>
<p>At 1.10 p.m.(0210 GMT), Discovery shares were four cents up at 81 cents.</p>
