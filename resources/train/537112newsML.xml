<title>DUBAI: Mideast Gulf oil outlook - European oil competes.</title>
<headline>Mideast Gulf oil outlook - European oil competes.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1997-04-24</dateline>

<p>Stiff competition from rival European cargoes in the next week is expected to cap prices and premiums for Gulf refined oil products seeking Asian and Indian markets, traders based in the Gulf said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gulf middle distillates suffered from supply length as potential buyers in Asia and India turned to better arbitrage opportunities in the Mediterranean, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;An overhang is developing as buyers source their requirements from the Mediterranean...demand for Gulf material is subdued,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Mediterranean availability countered a potentialy bullish string of term and spot buying tenders from Indian Oil Corp (IOC) which has previously supported the Gulf market.</p>
<p>IOC has invited offers to supply the state oil firm to supply term high speed diesel and superior kerosene from June 1997 to May 1998 and has also released its regular spot diesel tender for June supplies.</p>
<p>Bids for these tenders are to be submitted by April 29.</p>
<p>In its last spot diesel tender for May deliveries, IOC surprised the market by securing 870,000 tonnes, well above initial market expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;IOC has quite a shopping list. But at this stage it is not turning the market around,&quot; said a trader in the Gulf.</p>
<p>Gulf kerosene, at $22.80 a barrel on Thursday and already labouring under a seasonal downturn in heating demand, was struggling to maintain a premium to quotes as buyers looked at supplies from further afield, traders said.</p>
<p>Kerosene was assessed around a five cents premium following unconfirmed talk in the market that one trader was awarded a 25,000 tonne cargo from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) at a slight premium to independent price quotes.</p>
<p>Gas oil faired slightly better at a 30-40 cents premium to an outright price of around $24.70 a barrel, though the grade also faced an uphill struggle to find buyers because of competing Mediterranean supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Term supply talks between Gulf refiners and customers remained focused on preliminary negotiations between Saudi Aramco and Asian customers for naphtha deliveries</p>
<p>Gulf spot naphtha premiums were assessed at around $13 on Thursday, adding to expectations that Aramco could squeeze double-digit premiums from Japanese and South Korean A-180 naphtha lifters during July to December.</p>
