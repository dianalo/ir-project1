<p>Chinese President Jiang Zemin has set reform of loss-making state firms as a priority this year and the cabinet has put aside $3.6 billion as a reserve fund to re-employ millions made jobless by bankrupt dinosaurs.</p>
<p>&quot;China's state-owned enterprises control the lifeline of the national economy and play a dominant role in national economic development,&quot; the People's Daily on Tuesday quoted Jiang, who is also Communist Party chief, as telling deputies to the National People's Congress, or parliament.</p>
<p>The thorny task of reforming loss-making state enterprises -- backbone of China's socialist system -- is the centrepiece of the annual government work report for 1997 by Premier Li Peng that was presented to parliament at the weekend.</p>
<p>Jiang did not hesitate to stress the importance of the market forces introduced to China by his mentor, late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, in forcing tens of thousands of state-owned firms to make a profit or go under.</p>
<p>State firms, which haemorrhaged money last year when losses skyrocketed 45 percent in the first nine months, faced difficulties, Jiang said. &quot;This has become an outstanding issue in our economic life,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He cited the failure of state firms, cushioned for decades by government subsidies and a state plan, to operate in line with market factors.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly, they are structurally irrational. The traditional industrial structure and the traditional product mix are no longer suited for the change from a sellers' to a buyers' market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Competition from a flood of foreign investment and booming rural enterprises was hurting state industry, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And fourth, owing to historical reasons, state-owned enterprises suffer from too high a debt burden and shoulder too heavy social burdens,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He urged breaking down regional and departmental barriers and an end to unlawful competition -- or protectionism.</p>
<p>Economic tsar, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, was more direct.</p>
<p>&quot;Bankruptcies should be standardised, mergers should be encouraged,&quot; he told deputies.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the majority of industrial products are in over-supply, state-owned enterprises should work hard to restructure instead of building new plants.&quot;</p>
<p>Zhu offered a solution to the spectre of mounting unemployment -- anathema to China's communist leaders who fear social unrest could erode their grip on power.</p>
<p>China's State Council, or cabinet, is to set aside 30 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) this year as a reserve fund for re-employment and mergers and bankruptcies of state-owned enterprises, Zhu said.</p>
<p>The funds will be used for re-employment programmes to provide jobs for workers displaced by mergers and bankruptcies.</p>
<p>&quot;Providing conditions for a good settlement of these workers is an important way to help money-losing state enterprises out of their difficulties,&quot; Zhu was quoted as saying.</p>
