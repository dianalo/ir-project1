<p>Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest bank, said on Tuesday it had raised its takeover offer to shareholders of mortgage lender BNbank by five crowns to 203.50 crowns per share excluding dividend.</p>
<p>The bank said it had received acceptance from 68 percent of BNbank's shareholders so far and that it was raising its offer to bring the deal to a quick close.</p>
<p>DnB on Monday extended its bid deadline until Thursday.  </p>
<p>DnB said the new offer price for BNbank was also valid to those who had already accepted its bid. It added that it was lifting its condition of 90 percent acceptance.</p>
<p>The bank has twice extended the deadline for its offer, which was launched in March in competition with a rival bid for BNbank by Fokus Bank. Fokus, Norway's fourth biggest bank, has a share exchange offer valuing BNbank at 2.06 billion crowns.</p>
