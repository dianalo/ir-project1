<p>There is no economic need for a UK budget on Wednesday because the public finances are in good shape, Kenneth Clarke, former chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) for the ousted Conservative Party, told BBC radio on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no need for a budget at all. In fact the public finances are in a better state than I expected,&quot; he said. &quot;This is to do with politics -- this is getting elected for a second term.&quot;</p>
<p>Gordon Brown, chancellor for the Labour government which won the May 1 election after 18 years in opposition, is due to hold a budget on Wednesday at which he is expected to announce tax rises of four billion stg or more.</p>
<p>Clarke said that Brown's aim was to control spending and put up taxation now &quot;when he doesn't need to&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Later in the parliament he will put spending up without raising taxation and he thinks that's a clever way of getting back for a second term,&quot; Clarke said.</p>
<p>But he warned that a higher tax burden would slow down the economy. &quot;He's going to deliver an economy that grows slower, unemployment that doesn't fall so fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Some financial experts argue that Brown must raise taxes in the UK to prevent the exuberant consumer sector from pushing the economy into an unsustainable boom.</p>
<p>But others say that fiscal policy is a blunt tool for demand management and say that interest rates should be allowed to take the strain.</p>
<p>There is speculation that the Bank of England will raise Britain's 6.5 percent official interest rates again next week following a surge in consumer spending and borrowing. Consumers are set to receive a financial boost totalling 30 billion stg from building society mergers and flotations.</p>
