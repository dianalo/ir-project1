<p>Buyers were conspicuous by there absence on the UK meals and feeds market on Tuesday despite sharply lower high protein soymeal prices.</p>
<p>High pro ex-mill and ex-stores was as much as six stg down with reports of some sellers seven to eight stg lower in the near months.</p>
<p>The sharp falls were triggered by a collapse in soybean futures on the Chicago market following news that the USDA had left it's soybean carryover figure unchanged at 125 million bushels.</p>
<p>&quot;You would have thought that buyers would have jumped in with both feet this morning, but they are still very cautious,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Only one trade was reported when high pro soymeal fetched 223.50 stg a tonne for spot ex-store Southampton.</p>
<p>Rapemeal was unchanged ex-mill Erith while the Liverpool and Hull mills were one stg lower.</p>
<p>Most other sectors of the market were unchanged.</p>
