<p>Significantly fewer journalists were killed on the job in 1996, but the reporter's trade remains a dangerous one in many parts of the world, press watchdog group Reporters sans Frontieres (RSF) said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite some good news, 1996 will probably not go down in history as a great year for press freedom,&quot; Reporters sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) said in its annual report.</p>
<p>The report, released to mark the international day of press freedom on May 3, said the sharp drop in the number of deaths was due to a period of calm in Algeria, a peace agreement in the former Yugoslavia and a respite in the killing in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;A total of 28 (journalists) paid with their lives for their courage in exposing unacceptable behaviour by those with power.&quot; The report listed 20 other journalists whose deaths were under investigation and 64 more who were missing on January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>The toll marks the second consecutive drop in journalist deaths after an especially deadly 1994, in which 103 journalists were killed because of their work.</p>
<p>At least 49 journalists were killed in 1995, 59 in 1993 and 61 in 1992, RSF has said. Hundreds of journalists were arrested during 1996 and 93 were in prison worldwide on January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>But despite the drop in killings, RSF drew attention to the troubling lack of investigation of most journalist deaths.</p>
<p>&quot;Hunting down journalists is becoming a risk-free activity, whether in Russia, Turkey or Latin America,&quot; the report said. &quot;More often than not, the police do not even carry out a serious investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Algeria, where Islamic fundamentalists have specifically targetted news people, remained the most dangerous place in the world for journalists. Eight lost their life there in 1996, bringing the total number of reporters, editors and photographers killed since 1993 to 57. Three are missing and one is in jail.</p>
<p>RSF said another disturbing trend was the increase in legislation aiming to gag the media in countries calling themselves democracies.</p>
<p>&quot;It is almost as if some heads of state wanted to bring back the old crime of lese majeste,&quot; the report said, pointing the finger at Africa in particular.</p>
<p>Only one murder of a journalist was reported in sub-Saharan Africa last year, down from five killed in 1995 and 77 in 1994.</p>
<p>The situation in Latin America was varied, with Cuba, Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala singled out for criticism, but Peru praised for freeing three reporters.</p>
<p>The report slammed China as the &quot;bastion of repression&quot; in Asia. &quot;The profusion of financial news emerging from communist China as it moves towards a capitalist system cannot hide the lack of an independent general news press.&quot;</p>
<p>The situation in Europe and the former Soviet Union remained difficult, with the former Yugoslavia among the most disturbing, the report said.</p>
<p>The war in Chechnya claimed the lives of four journalists and four others are listed as missing. Turkey was censured for keeping in place &quot;an arsenal of laws and regulations that severely restrict press freedom&quot;.</p>
<p>Four journalists were killed in Russia last year and two each in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines.</p>
<p>One journalist was killed on the job in Angola, Cambodia, Cyprus, Colombia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Ireland, Pakistan, Tadjiskistan and Turkey.</p>
