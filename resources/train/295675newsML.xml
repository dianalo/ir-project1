<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin is in hospital again, this time with the first signs of pneumonia, and his illness has revived fears about his ability to govern the sprawling nuclear state of 150 million people.</p>
<p>By early Thursday morning there were no fresh reports on Yeltsin's condition.</p>
<p>The first indication about the seriousness of the illness might come from Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's constitutional number two.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin was due to leave on Thursday for a short holiday but Russia's NTV commercial television said Yeltsin's illness might force the loyal premier to abandon the trip.</p>
<p>Under the constitution, Chernomyrdin would stand in for up to three months before an election if Yeltsin was unable to govern. He stepped in for a day when Yeltsin had his heart bypass operation on November 5.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, went down with a heavy cold on Monday, two weeks after his return to the Kremlin on December 23 following the heart surgery.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, the Kremlin said doctors had detected the first signs of pneumonia when they examined the presidsent.</p>
<p>&quot;In connection with this, in order to make a better diagnosis and to conduct appropriate treatment, a decision has been taken to take him to the Central Clinical Hospital (in Moscow) for several days,&quot; said a Kremlin statement.</p>
<p>A presidential spokesman said Yeltsin entered the hospital at about nine p.m. (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. The spokesman made no mention of the trigger which controls Russia's nuclear arsenal but it usually accompanies Yeltsin at all times.</p>
<p>Pioneering U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, an adviser to the Russian doctors who carried out the heart operation on Yeltsin, said he expected the president to make a quick recovery from what he believed was probably a case of flu.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is a transient condition. You know normally people recover from the flu quite well and usually within a week, 10 days, two weeks, it's all over with,&quot; he told BBC World Service radio on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is quite a bit of flu, sort of an epidemic, going on in Moscow and he developed this flu along with other members of the Kremlin, including his family.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if Yeltsin had recovered from the trauma of the heart surgery, DeBakey said: &quot;I would say pretty much yes and his heart is functioning now virtually normally.&quot;</p>
<p>DeBakey said people who underwent such heart surgery were not weakened or made delicate. &quot;Not at all. As a matter of fact they recover normally, they're back to normal condition.&quot;</p>
<p>But Yeltsin's political opponents clearly saw his new health problem as a chance to attack him.</p>
<p>General Alexander Lebed, sacked by Yeltsin as national security adviser last October for manifesting open presidential ambitions, told Ekho Moskvy radio station that the president was too old and sick to govern.</p>
<p>&quot;Our country is headed by a very sick and elderly man. He needs to retire since he can neither govern due to the state of his health nor lead a normal life,&quot; said Lebed.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's long absence from the Kremlin last year fuelled a struggle for position among Kremlin officials that culminated in Lebed's sacking.</p>
<p>Some economic problems have also mounted during his absence -- such as tax evasion which left state coffers nearly bare and led to long delays in payments of wages and pensions.</p>
<p>Yeltsin vowed to deal with those issues immediately on his return to work but clearly did not have enough time to do so.</p>
<p>The president, who has been looking pale and tired, had cancelled all appointments since Monday because of what the Kremlin said then was a heavy cold. Doctors said the cold was not related to the operation and did not threaten his heart.</p>
<p>The president suffered two heart attacks in 1995 and spent much of last year out of the Kremlin with health problems.</p>
<p>Yeltsin played a major role in ending Communist rule in 1991 and overseeing economic reforms. He has been president since 1991 and fought a tough re-election campaign last year but fell ill just before the decisive round of voting on July 3.</p>
