<p>IPE August Brent futures broke briefly above resistance at $18.17 a barrel on Friday on technical strength, short-term tightness of Atlantic Basin crudes and the temporary absence of Iraqi barrels from the market.</p>
<p>The contract was up 29 cents at $18.14 at 1441 GMT having climbed briefly to $18.23 a few minutes earlier. July gas oil was $2.25 stronger at $164.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been going sideways for a while so some of the longer-term moving averages may have crossed and caused the funds to come back in and buy,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>Traders said financial funds have been short for some time and may be looking to cover before a resuming bearish positions early next month.</p>
<p>The next technical upside target on Brent was seen at $18.17 a barrel, a previous high, $18.40 and then $18.45.</p>
<p>Traders in the physical markets attributed strength partly to the short-term tightness in the Atlantic basin.</p>
<p>A Gullfaks A cargo changed hands six cents higher than a deal done on Thursday and at least one Nigeria cargo is due to go east to India.</p>
<p>Continued tension over Iraq's $2 billion oil-for-food deal with the United Nations was also providing a bullish backdrop.</p>
<p>Iraq's Deputy Prime Minster Tareq Aziz said &quot;deliberate acts&quot; by the United States had caused a serious setback to his country's environment and a deterioration in living standards.</p>
<p>Despite the gains many dealers expected prices to resume falling soon. They said a resumption of Iraqi exports next month and excess OPEC crude are likely to weigh on the market.</p>
