<p>Czech players had contrasting fortunes in the quarter-finals of the European Community tournament on Friday with Petr Korda winning easily but Martin Damm retiring after only four games.</p>
<p>Korda trounced Belgian qualifier Dick Norman, the tallest player on the ATP tour at 2.03 metres, 6-3 6-4.</p>
<p>Damm, who had sprained his ankle in the last set of his second round match against Chilean Marcelo Rios on Thursday, was trailing German Marc Goellner 3-1 in the first set when he pulled out.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not expect him to give up,&quot; said Goellner. &quot;I saw him in the locker room before and he did about 10, 15 kangeroo jumps and I thought 'okay, he's top fit',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he soon noted that Damm, who had also played a doubles match after hurting his ankle, appeared slower and his service weaker than usual.</p>
<p>Norman said he felt somewhat tired mentally and physically after his late night shock win over fifth seed Felix Mantilla of Spain on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I just was unable to attack on Korda's service,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Korda, who will meet either Belgian lucky loser Filip Dewulf or Swiss Marc Rosset in the semifinals, said he was not feeling 100 percent but was determined to fight for victory.</p>
<p>He said he had had flu before a Davis Cup encounter with India two weeks ago.</p>
