<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures reversed direction to end slightly lower on Friday due to pre-weekend profit taking.</p>
<p>Traders said dealings were slow and they were again dominated by nearby switch trades. July/Sept spread widened again to $20-$25 from $10 on Thursday as players completed the roll-over of the July position into September.</p>
<p>The market was called higher at the open and stayed firm towards the midsession. But it lost ground slightly in the afternoon as New York put up another uninspiring session.</p>
<p>September was traded from a high of $1,895 -- the opening price -- to a low of $1,853, before finishing $4 down at $1,856.</p>
<p>Turnover was a meagre 4,872 lots and the bulk of business was in spread trading. July/Sept traded up to $28 and Sept/Nov at $20.</p>
<p>Technically, analysts expected the market to move in a wide $1,700-$2,000 band basis September in the absence of major market-moving news.</p>
<p>No major cold is in sight in Brazil's coffee areas in the next three to five days.</p>
<p>Private U.S. forecaster Weather Services Corp said temperatures were forecast near normal on Friday and above normal on Saturday and through to Tuesday.</p>
<p>Conditions were generally favourable for the trees but some disruptions to the harvest were still expected from scattered showers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Indonesian traders said there had been no news of robusta contract defaults by local firms, who were mostly holding off deals in anticipation of increases in London.</p>
<p>In other news, Peru has declared nine of its 24 regions in emergency on Friday to speed the nation's preparations for the harmful &quot;El Nino&quot; weather system that is expected to form later this year.</p>
<p>The weather phenomemon causes droughts in the south of Peru and heavy rainfalls in the country's north.</p>
