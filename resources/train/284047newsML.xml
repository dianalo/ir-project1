<headline>US money managers long on US debt over past wk - MCM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. fixed-income managers were consistently long and reflecting a bullish bias in their positions in U.S. debt markets over the past week, according to an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey.</p>
<p>&quot;The big guys are long (and) the rest of the pack is catching up,&quot; said MCM money market analyst Peter McTeague, who conducts the asset allocation survey.</p>
<p>The weekly survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark slipped to 108.2 percent in the week ended December 30 from 108.3 percent in the prior week.  </p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market.</p>
<p>A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.</p>
<p>In the &quot;next likely move&quot; category, portfolio managers representing 24 percent of total assets in the survey said they would &quot;buy,&quot; slightly lower from 25 percent the prior week.</p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward &quot;sell&quot; dropped to 10 percent, down from 22 percent in the week ended December 23.  </p>
<p>Sixty-six percent of managers said they were &quot;neutral&quot; on the market, up from 53 percent a week ago.</p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 2.20 percent, against 2.36 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>The survey showed 32 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, up from 31 percent the previous week, while nine percent underweighted it. The remaining 59 percent were &quot;neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 48 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 11 percent underweighted them.  </p>
<p>The survey included 38 domestic participants, who manage about $110 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday.  </p>
