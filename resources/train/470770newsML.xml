<title>AUSTRALIA: Ansett in business-class dogfight with Qantas.</title>

<p>Australian airline Ansett launched its new &quot;BusinessFirst&quot; service on Wednesday, joining battle with rival Qantas in an agressive pitch for the wallets and stomachs of the business traveller.</p>
<p>Ansett, owned 50/50 by News Corp Ltd and Air New Zealand Ltd, said the new class would replace its first and business class services on local flights from April 2, offering restaurant service at existing business-class fares.</p>
<p>Ansett also announced it would upgrade its gate lounges and airport club lounges to give it a new, &quot;stylish&quot; image.  </p>
<p>&quot;Ansett Australia is offering you a whole new way to fly,&quot; said the airline's general manager for sales and marketing, Rick Ellis, during a presentation at Melbourne airport.</p>
<p>Qantas, which leads Ansett in the two airlines' dogfight for market share in Australia, has also announced it will merge its first and business classes next month.</p>
<p>Both airlines decided to scrap first class because they were flying with too many empty seats at the front of the plane.</p>
<p>Ellis said the cost of the refit to Ansett's domestic aircraft would be minimal, with jets being adapted only when they were due for a major maintenance session in the hanger.  </p>
<p>&quot;The costs are fairly minimal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new Business First service will include restaurant menus and service, more leg room than traditional business class and new posture-friendly seats, Ansett said.</p>
