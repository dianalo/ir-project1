<p>Nearby London cocoa futures pared some gains towards the close on Friday after the New York market failed to extend its Thursday's run-up on lack of fresh interest, traders said.</p>
<p>Actively-traded December contract, which accounted for almost half of the total volume of 2,478 lots, moved within the 1,023-1,029 stg range in the afternoon. It ended nine stg up at 1,029 stg.</p>
<p>Benchmark September managed just a four stg gain at 991 stg, still the best finish in a week, but well below the closely-watched 1,000 stg.</p>
<p>Sept/Dec spread stood at 38 stg at the close against 33 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The market slumped to a four-month low of 965 stg earlier in the week on speculative liquidation. Traders said the sell-off was well absorbed and the market was now poised to move much higher.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a good offtake to spec selling. It will be a good week next week,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>New York's volume was a weak 1,947 lots after two hours of trading. September fell $5 at $1,511 at 1625 GMT after a strong close on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people believe the New York market would move back up again,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>But others were less optimistic, saying there were few fundamental reasons to support the rise. Cocoa is also prone to further selling by speculators who are still long in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;We are just two months away from the main crop harvest and the market traditionally never rally at this time of the year as there will be ample cocoa,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The main 1997/98 Ivorian crop is said to be developing quite well and early assessments point to another good crop at above 1.0 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Chartwise, analysts said LIFFE's September contract was seen edging back to the 1,000 stg level but selling pressure still likely to be heavy.</p>
<p>On the downside, support is seen at Thursday's low of 965, the lowest in four months. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
