<p>Taiwan share prices closed higher for the third straight day on Monday, pushing to their highest level since June, 1990 after flirting with -- but failing to breach -- strong resistance at 7,200 points, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended up 71.40 points or 1.00 percent to 7,189.47. That surpassed the 7,183.75 point close of October 3, 1994, which until Monday had stood as the highest close since a 7,339.71 finish on June 5, 1990. The index hit its historic high of 12,495.34 on February 10, 1990.</p>
<p>Turnover was a T$101.1 billion, signalling the market had emerged from a year-end holiday lull, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Brokers said there were rotational rises in construction shares, textiles, electrics, electronics and plastics.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise was a healthy one, with sectors taking turns to rise to support the overall bullish sentiment,&quot; said Alex Chen, assistant research manager at HSBC James Capel Taiwan.</p>
<p>The index has rebounded for six of the past seven sessions since taking a 1.64 percent plunge on January 4 after Taiwan provincial governor James Soong's shock resignation to protest moves to dismantle his largely redundant administration.</p>
<p>The political uncertainties have waned since President Lee Teng-hui met Soong last week, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The political worries have eased and the economic outlook is good in 1997,&quot; Chen said. &quot;The index has matched well with the surging turnover. Sentiment is really bullish.&quot;</p>
<p>The government has forecast 1997 gross domestic product growth at 6.20 percent, up from an estimated 5.70 percent rise in 1996.</p>
<p>Construction shares rose strongly as many construction firms are expected to enjoy 20-30 percent growth in 1997 earnings. BES Engineering and Pao Shiang rose the daily seven percent limit to T$29.7 and T$24.5, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Constructions will be among the best performing sectors in 1997,&quot; said Nikko Securities research chief Michael Hung.  </p>
<p>But brokers noted caution as the index neared resistance at 7,200 points as once this level is surpassed, margin-buying must be scaled back under exchange rules.</p>
<p>The margin-buying ratio would be reduced to 50 percent of share prices bought, down from the current 60 percent they can borrow from securities financing firms to buy shares. Margin loans outstanding hit a record high T$301 billion on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;This surely will limit some buying power, but the impact will be mainly psychological as many investors do not use margin buying,&quot; said National Securities manager Allen Huang.  </p>
<p>Brokers said they nevertheless expected a further firming trend with the index testing 7,200 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Once it breaks the 7,200 level, the index may surge to test 7,300, but if caution emerges, profit-taking may also occur,&quot; said Chen of James Capel. Initial support was seen at 7,150.</p>
