<p>Democratic President Bill Clinton launched his second term on Monday with a grand vision of America as &quot;a land of New Promise&quot; in a new millenium, and asked his bitter Republican rivals to help him lead it there.</p>
<p>&quot;America demands and deserves big things from us -- and nothing big ever came from being small,&quot; Clinton said, running up a flag of political truce minutes after taking his oath as the last U.S. president of the 20th century.</p>
<p>&quot;May those generations whose faces we cannot yet see ... say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the American Dream alive for all her children ... with America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout the world,&quot; he said at the outdoor Capitol Hill inaugural.</p>
<p>&quot;Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us set our sights upon a land of New Promise.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Clinton, 50, a controversial man who looked to many like a one-term flop two years ago, led his inaugural parade down Pennsylvia Avenue past throngs gathered to savor history and have some fun on a cold but occasionally sunny day.</p>
<p>Behind the black limousine carrying the president, wife Hillary and teenaged daugher Chelsea came a colourful cavalcade of floats, marching bands, baton twirlers, horses, clowns and costumed merrymakers from every U.S. state.</p>
<p>For most of the 1.6 mile parade route onlookers had to content themselves with a quick murky glimpse of Clinton smiling and waving from behind the smoked-glass of his limo.</p>
<p>Waving back, they heard his disembodied voice intoning &quot;Hello! Welcome! Thank you!&quot; through a hand-held microphone.</p>
<p>The three Clintons finally hopped out half a block from the White House, prompting cheers and chants of &quot;USA! USA!&quot; from those privileged to have ticketed seats in that area.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm more excited today than the first time,&quot; Clinton was quoted as telling senators at an inaugural luncheon.</p>
<p>Washington, for this day at least, had decked itself out in bunting, flags and high spirits instead of the dirty political linen of recent scandals and campaign fights.</p>
<p>Clinton seized the moment to make a pointed appeal to the Republican Congress to end their feuding and help him forge a leaner, cleaner government for the new age.</p>
<p>&quot;The American people returned to office a president of one party and a Congress of another,&quot; he said in a speech before thousands gathered atop Capitol Hill with a panoramic view across a red-white-and-blue bedecked Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore. No, they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach and to move on with America's mission.&quot;</p>
<p>The conciliatory message carried special resonance in a capital riven with partisan warfare.</p>
<p>Congress was only taking a day off from the wrenching procedure of punishing Republican House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich -- who offered Clinton gracious words at the congressional luncheon -- for ethics violations. It will complete that business on Tuesday with a House vote.</p>
<p>And the personal controversy spotlight will swing back to Clinton as soon as it leaves Gingrich.</p>
<p>A continuing investigation of the Whitewater Arkansas financial affair and a new one into Democratic presidential campaign fund-raising practices face him as well as an attempt by a former Arkansas state employee to sue him for alleged sexual harassment in 1991 when he was Arkansas governor.</p>
<p>But for Clinton, those were headaches for another day.</p>
<p>He took his second-term oath at 12:05 p.m. EST (1705 GMT) and turned to bestow hugs and kisses on his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>He was starting off not merely on a second term but on something of a second honeymoon with the public.</p>
<p>Several new opinion polls give him job approval ratings of about 60 percent -- the highest since he first took office in 1993 and high for any second-term president.</p>
<p>Clinton, who doffed his overcoat and braved the cold hatless in a dark blue suit, also offered grand visionary words appropriate to the occasion and the special place he occupies &quot;on the edge of a new century, in a new millennium.&quot;</p>
<p>In a speech of about 25 minutes, he cited as a source of inspiration slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, who gave his famous &quot;I have a dream speech&quot; in 1963 from a spot Clinton could see on the horizon from where he stood.</p>
<p>Monday was also a national holiday marking King's birth.</p>
<p>Clinton underscored the &quot;land of New Promise&quot; phrase as his signature slogan -- as John Kennedy once offered &quot;New Frontier,&quot; for instance -- and said that promise would range from things as grand as racial harmony to things as basic as a balanced federal budget and reforms of notoriously lax political financing laws.</p>
<p>He backed up his conciliatory gesture toward the Republicans with more centrist messages including the balanced budget pledge on which he has all but outflanked them.</p>
<p>But he went beyond that to preach of leaner government the way conservative Ronald Reagan once might have.</p>
<p>&quot;A government that is smaller lives within its means and does more with less,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He kept his foreign policy comments to generalities, saying, &quot;We will stand mighty for peace and freedom and maintain a strong defence against terror and destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>The day's festivities were to conclude with black-tie balls.</p>
