<p>The U.S. government should toughen its safeguards against &quot;mad cow&quot; disease, consumer and union groups said Thursday, asking for more research into pig diseases and a broader ban on use of animal proteins in livestock feeds.</p>
<p>They acted because of recently renewed interest in a two-decade-old study that found similarities to an illness like &quot;mad cow,&quot; bovine spongiform encephalopathy, in one brain tissue sample from a pig sent to market in New York state.</p>
<p>&quot;None of our groups think it is responsible to conclude there is a (porcine) transmissible spongiform encephalopathy,&quot; said Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower group that often works with federal employees.</p>
<p>But, Devine said &quot;it's premature to give pork a clean bill of health&quot; and said the Agriculture Department needed to do more research and disclose more of its information.</p>
<p>&quot;We share concern about the possible risk,&quot; an Agriculture Department spokeswoman said but added there were no signs of a transmissible spongiform encephalophathy in pigs.</p>
<p>While the consumer and union groups termed a re-examination of the 1979 tissue sample as inconclusive, the spokeswoman said one reviewer found no signs of TSE and another said conditions in the brain tissue could be natural, rather than a TSE.</p>
<p>In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the groups asked for stepped-up inspection of hogs before slaughter to prevent animals with central nervous diseases from entering the food supply, new studies to see if an unknown central nervous system disease exists among pigs, and including swine in screening of livestock for signs of TSE infection.</p>
<p>Consumers Union, a large U.S. consumer group, sent a separate letter to the Food and Drug Administration suggesting that pigs should be included in a proposed ban on animal protein in livestock feed.</p>
