<title>ALBANIA: Bridge to rebel-held Albanian port bombed.</title>
<headline>Bridge to rebel-held Albanian port bombed.</headline>
<dateline>MUZINE, Albania 1997-03-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A key bridge leading to rebel-held Sarande in southern Albania has been bombed, limiting access to the coastal town, a Reuters photographer at the scene said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Heavily-armed rebels were building up defences around the town near the Greek border. They blocked access roads every 100 metres (yards) with trucks and barricades to defend against any possible assault by the Albanian army.</p>
<p>Thousands of local residents are heavily armed after joining the Sarande uprising at the weekend and stealing arms from state arsenals. They are defiantly challenging President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>The Muzine road, where the bridge was bombed, is one of two land links into Sarande. Muzine is on the main road to the town from Greece. The other road comes down the coast from the north.</p>
<p>A deep crater, five metres (yards) across, was blasted in the road on the Muzine bridge and only private cars could skirt around it.</p>
<p>It was unclear which side, rebels or army, had blown up the bridge during fighting on Wednesday. It was the first clash between rebels, who seized the town during rioting over the weekend, and the regular army.</p>
<p>Four army tanks were parked on the main north-south road at the junction to Muzine. The soldiers let cars detour around the tanks without interference and head west to Sarande.</p>
<p>Several kms (miles) down the Muzine road well-armed gunmen stopped cars at the first of a series of rebel checkpoints. For the first time rebels searched cars for weapons before letting them pass.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a war on. What else can we do,&quot; one gunman said.</p>
<p>Albania has been swept by anti-government protests and riots since January when five pyramid investment schemes collapsed and thousands of Albanians lost their life savings.</p>
<p>In the Balkan country's relatively prosperous south, where there is a large ethnic Greek community, the pyramid riots have evolved into a popular uprising against Berisha.</p>
