<p>Germany's deputy foreign minister said on Thursday he was worried any eruption of violence in Albania could lead to a mass exodus abroad that would cause problems in many European countries.</p>
<p>Werner Hoyer, state secretary in the foreign ministry, told German Radio both the potential of vast numbers of refugees fleeing to countries such as Italy and Germany and the prospect of violence in Albania were of great concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Both of these are difficult problems for us. We cannot simply stand by and watch if murder and pure anarchy break out in Albania,&quot; Hoyer said.</p>
<p>&quot;But on the other hand there is the problem of refugees and it could easily turn into a massive exodus.&quot;</p>
<p>Hoyer said Germany was already carrying a large burden, having sheltered some 320,000 refugees from former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>He said many of the refugees in Germany were from the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia, largely populated by ethnic Albanians.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, a refugee movement out of Albania would represent a huge problem for us,&quot; Hoyer said. &quot;But that doesn't change the fact that, alongside the refugee problem, there is the problem of the security and human rights situation.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 20 people have been reported killed in southern Albania in violent protests sparked by the collapse of several get-rich-quick investment schemes. A night-time curfew has been ordered and troops have been called in to quell the unrest.</p>
