<p>European high sulphur fuel barges ended the week steady to a shade firmer with demand said to have improved, while low sulphur barges were steady to firmer after trading strongly earlier.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges traded as high as $84, slightly up on a day earlier, for July 10 delivery after changing hands earlier at $83.25, $83.50 for July 5.</p>
<p>Prompt barges were dealt steadily higher from $82, $82.50 to $83, the same as Thursday's late levels.</p>
<p>Demand was said to be better than a day earlier.</p>
<p>Rotterdam bunker prices were little changed in modest business totalling some 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Traders said 380 CST fuel was priced at $84/88 a tonne and 180 CST at $88/92, with Antwerp prices at the same level for the former grade and $2 higher for the latter.</p>
<p>The Hamburg market was quiet after Thursday's busy trade. Prices were steady at $92/94 for 380 cSt and $97/998 for 180 cSt.</p>
<p>No deals were heard in low sulphur barges but traders said sellers were now at the $96/$97 after Thursday's trades at that level and buyers were $1 higher at $95.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were quiet but traders said the market was steady after strong trades earlier and with not much Russian material on the market.</p>
<p>A Scandinavian refiner said it sold a 30-40 kt cargo of bunker spec material with fifty percent done at $75.50 fob and the second half at high fob quote plus $3 on Thursday.</p>
<p>One cargo of Russian cracked was said to be on offer at two means plus $1, a bit stronger than a day earlier, but other traders said the figure was exaggerated.</p>
<p>One percent was said to be steady to weaker, with traders saying that a U.K. refiner cut its offer price a little to about $94 a tonne fob.</p>
<p>The refiner later said that it sold the cargo but the deal was private and confidential, but it added that although the market was a bit tighter on supplies, demand was not big and with crude seen heading south, low sulphur should follow suit.</p>
