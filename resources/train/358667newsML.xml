<p>Britain's main opposition Labour party vowed on Wednesday to freeze the pay of MPs, senior civil servants and the military during its first year in government if it wins the forthcoming general election.</p>
<p>In an interview in the Financial Times, opposition economics spokesman Gordon Brown said Labour cabinet ministers would not take the 16,000 pound ($25,650) pay rise due after the election.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not be taking that,&quot; Brown said, referring to the increase that would push ministers' pay to 103,000 pounds ($165,100).</p>
<p>&quot;We do not think it is right to go ahead with pay rises at the very top,&quot; he added. Conservative Prime Minister John Major must call a general election by May 22.</p>
<p>Enjoying a 20-point lead in opinion polls, Labour has pushed public sector pay to the top of the political agenda.</p>
<p>Brown spoke of his determination to &quot;redistribute public spending from low to high priority area&quot;.</p>
<p>The Financial Times said the freeze, which would affect about 5,000 people, was decided in secret by Brown and Labour party leader Tony Blair.</p>
<p>Denying he was penalising senior civil servants, Brown said Labour was being fair. Senior judges and military personnel should show leadership in a pressing need to reallocate public spending. ($1=.6237 Pound)</p>
