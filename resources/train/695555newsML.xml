<title>UK: NWE gasoline up, support seen from the U.S.</title>
<headline>NWE gasoline up, support seen from the U.S.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE oil products were mixed on Monday.</p>
<p>Gasoline edged up $1 but activity was slow. Some dealers still expect support from the United States to emerge over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Naphtha was little changed despite modest crude and gasoline gains.</p>
<p>Gas oil added $2-$4 a tonne as healthy German demand lifted spot market premiums, magnifying a rally on benchmark futures.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges steadied after trading higher at $85 fob ARA, but thin demand brought the levels down to as low as $83.25, within Friday's early range. Low sulphur barges were quietly talked flat at $95/$97.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were talked firm, after two cracked Russian cargoes changed hands late on Friday at $82 cif, a little higher than trades early last week.</p>
<p>One percent was heard offered a little higher at $95 but buyers were $2 below that level.</p>
