<p>Shares in J Sainsbury Plc dropped on Friday, continuing to suffer from Thursday's sale of 30 million shares by one investor and recent reductions in earnings estimates, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>After yesterday closing at its lowest level in over two years, Sainsbury shares were down 3-1/2p at 352 by 0911 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;There has been no good news on the company in the recent past, there have been downgrades and we have had a seller of 30 million shares,&quot; said analyst David Stoddart at Henderson Crosthwaite.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows what the results will be like when the company reports interims at the end of the month and one big backer has obviously decided it doesn't want to wait (for a recovery in the stock),&quot; Stoddart said.</p>
<p>Yesterday NatWest Securities cut Sainsbury to &quot;reduce&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; and cut its earnings estimates. Other analysts are also said to have recently lowered their forecasts.  </p>
<p>Yet Stoddart said Sainsbury could yet recover its momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;Not long ago everyone was writing Tesco off,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think there is any tearing hurry to buy the Sainsbury recovery story but the idea that the company is dead and buried is stretching things. Never say never.&quot;</p>
<p>By contrast, other supermarket stocks rose. Tesco Plc was up 5-1/2p at 318-1/2, ASDA Group Plc gained 3/4p at 109-3/4 and Safeway Plc put on 2-1/2p at 346-1/2.</p>
