<p>Few companies ban employees travelling on business from meeting coworkers or clients in private hotel rooms, but some are considering this step to discourage sexual harassment.</p>
<p>While a study by the American Management Association last year found 89 percent of its member companies have a formal policy covering sexual harassment, Eric Greenberg, director of management studies for the group, said he did not know if any specifically ban hotel room visits.</p>
<p>&quot;Few companies have such guidelines,&quot; said Diane Cardaci, an employment litigator in the Morristown, N.J., office of Jackson Lewis, a national workplace law firm that advocates guidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;When you mention it they say, 'Wow! We should have something like that.' They recognise the importance of having these policies,&quot; Cardaci said.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment expert Marcia Haight, president of Haight Consulting, in Pacific Palisades, Calif., said employers should not even book employees into rooms &quot;on the same floor or in the same area, and should not have business meetings in any room where there is a bed.&quot;</p>
<p>Several employers disagree. &quot;To my knowledge we have no such (hotel) policy nor plans for any,&quot; said Lee Hoffman, public affairs specialist at Du Pont Co., in Wilmington, Del., which does have a written policy on sexual harassment. &quot;We kind of leave it (travel) to people's discretion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It boils down to using your common sense,&quot; said Burke Stinson, a spokesman for AT&amp;T Corp., another company that does not prohibit hotel room visits. &quot;Hard and fast rules should not take precedent over your experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there are a couple of sales people on the road doing business for quite some time, it seems like overkill to tell them they can't go to each other's room if they so choose,&quot; Stinson said. &quot;On the other hand, it does seem prudent if you are not familiar with your company colleague, to use caution.&quot;</p>
<p>Stinson added: &quot;The common sense question is: 'By visiting someone's room, are you sending the wrong signal or potentially compromising yourself?' If you have any information that you could be doing either, then stay away.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Jackson Lewis' Cardaci, more executives are coming around to the view that hotel meetings should be held exclusively in conference rooms and public areas.</p>
<p>At conferences and conventions, she said, &quot;It's a good idea to set up a hospitality suite. Then there's no temptation to say 'Let's go to this person's room or that person's room' when there's a public area set aside for this purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>To protect their companies and themselves from liability, &quot;You (as an employee) have to conduct yourself in a way so that a business trip is an extension of the office. This applies to a hotel, a bar, a car or a plane,&quot; said Michael Esposito, an attorney with Jackson Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;You're never going to stop the employee who intentionally and wilfully wants to violate a sexual harassment policy,&quot; he said. Guidelines are needed to protect &quot;the individual who, sometimes, inadvertantly makes a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>Esposito cited the example of one male manager who claimed he knocked on a female subordinate's hotel room door at midnight &quot;to talk to her about issues that had come up at the day's meetings.</p>
<p>&quot;Though the executive likely was guilty of nothing more than 'misguided enthusiasm,'&quot; Esposito said, &quot;unfortunately, the woman got the wrong idea and was offended by it. She refused to let him in and when they got back to the home office she complained.&quot;</p>
<p>If the firm had had a strict policy banning hotel room visits, Esposito said, the manager's action may not have occurred.</p>
