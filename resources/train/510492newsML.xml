<headline>Xerox unveils digital copiers.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-15</dateline>

<p>Xerox Corp. launched a line of four high-speed digital copiers Tuesday that can be connected to computer networks for printing, scanning and faxing.</p>
<p>Xerox Chief Executive Officer Paul Allaire said the company had reached &quot;a digital critical mass&quot; and has &quot;embraced a digital future&quot; with the unveiling of the new machines.</p>
<p>The Xerox Document Centre 220 and 230 models, which can copy 20 and 30 pages per minute, respectively, are currently available with a facsimile upgrade in the United States, Canada and parts of Europe.</p>
<p>The 220 model's list price is $8,600 and the 230 is listed at $10,500.</p>
<p>The other two models, the Document Centre 240 and 265 will be available in the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>Allaire said he expected revenues for the new products to reach $2 billion &quot;over time.&quot;</p>
<p>The new copiers' components are all recyclable or reusable, the company said. They also include intuitive touch screens and 80 percent fewer replacable parts.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very important product announcement for them,&quot; said B. Alex Henderson, a Prudential Securities analyst. &quot;It's a very important element of their corporate strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Digital is where the future growth is,&quot; said Pete Enderlin, a Smith Barney analyst, adding that its digital products now make up about 30 percent of total revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;They will account for all the growth going forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Digital copiers represent big growth potential for Xerox.</p>
<p>Jonathan Rosenzweig of Salomon Brothers estimated in a recent report that digital product revenues will grow 22 percent in the company's first quarter.</p>
<p>This compares with Xerox's total revenue growth of 7 percent in the fourth quarter. Xerox is expected to report first quarter results on April 22.</p>
