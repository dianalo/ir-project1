<title>UK: Med oil products - light ends soft, others firm.</title>
<headline>Med oil products - light ends soft, others firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-19</dateline>

<p>Med oil products were mixed.</p>
<p>Gasoline appeared a little more resistant to weakness in the energy complex amid good demand for product.</p>
<p>A refiner was heard looking for a 26,000 tonne cargo containing 95 RON unleaded gasoline, 18,000 tonnes of which contained three percent benzene, and the rest low benzene.</p>
<p>The same refiner was looking for a mixed leaded/unleaded cargo for Genoa.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices fell with crude. Offers of Skikda material were heard at around $5 over cif quotes.</p>
<p>Gas oil was steady to slightly stronger.  </p>
<p>Traders said low sulphur material was fairly tight, with a few Italian players slightly short as the introduction of EN590 regulations on October 1 approaches.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cargoes were reported offered at quotes cif high +$5.0, basis Genoa.</p>
<p>Traders said 0.2 percent material was well supported by demand out of Greece and Turkey as well as a lack of Russian cargoes. Premiums on Russian material were put at quotes cif high +$2.50 to +$3.</p>
<p>Weaker crude futures failed to undermine fuel oil prices in the Med, essentially because of tight supplies.  </p>
<p>Tight supplies of good quality high sulphur fuel oil together with Portugal's tender to buy up to 150,000 tonnes of fuel in September, October and November nudged prices $1 up to $107-109 fob.</p>
<p>Demand into Romania was still seen. A high viscosity cargo was done on Wednesday at high fob +$1.20. An Italian refinery was looking for a mid October cargo, bidding around the flat mean fob quote and being met by offers of high fob +$1.</p>
<p>Straight run supplies out of Russia remain tight with cargoes able to hold prices.</p>
