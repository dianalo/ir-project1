<p>Russia's leading department store, Trade House GUM, told investors in London it aims to boost profits and double space at its prestigious Red Square building.</p>
<p>Company vice president Anatoly Stepanov said on Thursday that GUM would spend $192 million on refurbishing its main department store, build new stores outside Moscow and see a rapid rise in profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;We are consistently increasing sales and improving service. Our aim is to more than double retail space in our building in Red Square,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>GUM's main Moscow store, which occupies a prime spot opposite the Kremlin, has been transformed from dictator Josef Stalin's &quot;Showcase of Socialism and its achievements&quot; into a stockist chic western consumer goods from the likes of Christian Dior and Levis.</p>
<p>It boasts that sales per square metre are on a par with those of stores on New York's Fifth Avenue and that its customers come from Russia's burgeoing middle class.</p>
<p>Some 78 percent of its clients are under forty years old, with a eye for the best in western consumer goods, Stepanov said.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to be the store of choice for people whose other shopping option is going overseas,&quot; he added..</p>
<p>Targetting Russia's new rich has paid off and sales have risen from $103 million in 1992 to $199 million in 1995 and are seen growing to $250 million this year.</p>
<p>Profits have also risen, and GUM expects net income to rise to $50 million in 1995 from last year's $29.5 million.</p>
<p>Its aggressive expansion plans calls for an increase in retail space at its main Moscow store to 27,500 square metres by the year 2004 from 16,000 at present and expansion into Russia's provinces with five new stores.</p>
<p>GUM is looking at foreign partners to help meet part of the costs of the $192 million building plan in the Moscow store.</p>
<p>&quot;Seventy million dollars of the capital expenditure will come from reserves and the remainder from loans and a commercial partner. We are in the final stage of talks now,&quot; Stepanov said.</p>
<p>GUM aims to build on its brand name and success in Moscow by establishing its presence in the Russian hinterland, with stores in Smolensk, Orel, Kostroma, Tambov and Magnitorsk.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is that these stores will be in profit within two years,&quot; Stepanov said.</p>
<p>GUM's transformation from state-owned monolith to the cutting edge of capitalism had been exemplfied by foreign enthusiasm for its shares.</p>
<p>Overseas investors now own 40 percent of the company and are being rewarded with five seats on the company's 15 person board.</p>
<p>The share price has rocketed from less than $10 at the start of the year to $20 now as GUM participated in the Russian share boom after Boris Yeltsin saw off his communist challenger in the country's presidential election.</p>
<p>Democracy is also good for business, GUM believes.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a wobble in sales in the run-up to the presidential election in July. But the positive outcome should improve the economic environment and demand for GUM's products,&quot; company advisor Vladimir Tiurin said.</p>
