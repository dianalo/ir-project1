<p>The Australian wool market dropped further at auctions in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle this week, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said.</p>
<p>The eastern market indicator dropped 18 cents to 589 cents a kg clean while the western indicator fell 11 cents to 531 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Contrary to the general market trend, prices for finer wool types reflected the positive outlook at the end of the market, although there were significant price differentials between spinners and best topmaking types,&quot; the council said in its weekly market report.  </p>
<p>The largest quantity to date this season, a total of 96,187 bales, was offered with 17.7 percent passed in, it said.</p>
<p>In the futures market, a total of 266 contracts were traded in the 21 micron contract in the week ended Thursday. The near October contract closed 24 cents down at 726 cents a kg clean.</p>
<p>Wool International said it sold 5,481 bales of stockpile wool, which was much lower than in previous weeks, leaving the stockpile at 2,111,270 bales.</p>
<p>Sales next week are in Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle with about 108,000 bales on offer.</p>
