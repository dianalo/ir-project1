<p>Up to four people have been killed in a fresh outbreak of tribal violence near the mining town of Timika in Indonesia's remote Irian Jaya province, residents said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police described the incident at Harapan village in the Kwamki Lama area, about five km (three miles) north of Timika, as a tribal conflict between members of the Amumgne ethnic group on one side and the Dani and Nduga ethnic groups on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Our most recent information is that only one person has died,&quot; a policeman on duty in Timika, some 4,000 km (2,500 miles) east of Jakarta, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;But we do not know how many of those who were injured or who entered hospital have died,&quot; the policeman, who declined to be named, said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is now under control but as for tomorrow or the day after tommorrow we do not know,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Residents say the death toll has reached four.</p>
<p>One account by residents said the incident started from an attempted robbery by some Nduga men on two Amungme on Wednesday night which led to a revenge attack by a group of Amungme on Nduga houses in the village on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>They said a nephew of a village official from the Dani tribe was killed in the attack after being hit on the head by a stone.</p>
<p>Later, as security forces intervened, an Amungme man working for the security department of PT Freeport Indonesia was attacked and killed by Dani men after responding to a call by police to assist in liaison between the warring groups.</p>
<p>PT Freeport Indonesia, operator of one of the world's largest copper and gold mines at Tembagapura, about 45 km (28 miles) north of Timika, is 81.28 percent owned by Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc of the United States.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government and the Nusamba foundation, controlled by President Suharto, own the balance of the firm.</p>
<p>The military is believed to have deployed 150 soldiers to quell the disturbance, but police could not confirm the number.</p>
<p>In January, six people were killed and more than 60 injured when thousands of Amungme and Dani tribesman clashed near Tembagapura after an alleged rape.</p>
<p>Indonesia, the world's most populous Moslem nation, has been beset by a series of ethnic and religious clashes in recent months in West Kalimantan province on Borneo island and the main island of Java.</p>
