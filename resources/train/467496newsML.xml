<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Tuesday that if European monetary union (EMU) fails or is delayed the value of the deutschemark would rise and lead to the loss of more jobs in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;If we have problems on the jobs market at the moment, they would get a lot worse,&quot; Kinkel told reporters at a gathering of European Union foreign ministers to mark the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.  </p>
<p>EMU failure would force up mark, hit jobs - Kinkel</p>
<p>Kinkel also said that global financial markets were now anticipating that EMU would go ahead. If EMU doesn't come, other currencies would also be devalued, he said.</p>
<p>A revaluation of the mark would make German exports less competitive and risk increasing unemployment which, at 4.7 million, is at its highest since the 1930s, economists say.</p>
<p>Kinkel added, however, that he was convinced that the currency union would begin as planned on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The euro is a question of destiny for Europe, both internally and externally,&quot; Kinkel said.</p>
