<p>The magic of Australian mining tycoon Joseph Gutnick rubbed off on the public float by his sister on Friday of Western Australian gemstone explorer Diamond Rose NL.</p>
<p>Named after the late Rose Gutnick, the mother of Gutnick and promoter Pnina Feldman, Diamond Rose shares listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday at A$1.51 (US$1.01), more than seven times their 20 cent issue price.</p>
<p>Feldman's 57.5 percent stake through the unlisted Vageta Pty Ltd, whose tenements formed the basis of the A$10 million public offering, was valued at A$92 million at the closing price of A$1.29.</p>
<p>&quot;Very successful would be an understatement. It looks like the Gutnick followers have had another winner,&quot; said one broker, who added that the stock was likely to become scarce.</p>
<p>&quot;I imagine it would be fairly tightly controlled and hard to get any stock after the first couple of days trade,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Early trade was heavy as sellers took advantage of the sharp price rise. The closing price valued the company at A$160 million.</p>
<p>Diamond exploration and spectacular share price rises run in the family for Feldman, whose brother Joseph Gutnick runs the Great Central Mining NL and Astro Mining NL stable.</p>
<p>Astro, Gutnick's diamond exploration arm, rejoined the stock exchange lists in September 1996 at A$3.05, a five-fold increase on its price before it was suspended in May 1994.</p>
<p>Gutnick, whose empire nearly disappeared after the 1987 stock market crash, renewed his exploration efforts after the leader of the Orthodox Jewish Lubavitcher sect, the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, predicted he would find diamonds and gold in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Friday's listing coincided with the late religious leader's birthday, a good omen for the devoutly religious family.</p>
<p>Diamond Rose said in its prospectus that it holds reputedly the largest known diamond bearing lamproite pipe in the world at Walgidee Hills in the southern Kimberleys in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Feldman said she wanted to find the 12 types of gemstones of the Breastplate (Hoshen) worn by the High Priest in the Temple of Jerusalem over 3,000 years ago as described in the Bible.</p>
<p>&quot;The tenements already arguably contain five definite and possibly another two of the Hoshen gemstones,&quot; she said in the prospectus.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.78)</p>
