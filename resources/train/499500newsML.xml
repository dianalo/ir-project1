<p>Relatives of hostages held by Marxist guerrillas in the Japanese ambassador's home pleaded on Thursday for faster efforts to win their release, but a top official said the government would &quot;wait as long as it takes.&quot;</p>
<p>The wife of one of the 72 men held captive inside the besieged residence for 114 days said she was tired of waiting and worrying while mediators plodded ahead with talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are demanding a solution soon to this problem. We're tired of telling people that we've been crying for four months, and we want a settlement now,&quot; said Luis de Sivina, wife of hostage and Supreme Court justice Hugo Sivina.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to trust (President Alberto Fujimori) when he says over and over that the solution will be peaceful,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>The wives of some hostages, many of them high-ranking officials in Fujimori's government, have taken a more public profile lately as talks to end the standoff have languished.</p>
<p>The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels have not held face-to-face talks with government officials since March 12, when talks broke down on MRTA demands for freedom for hundreds of jailed comrades in exchange for the hostages.</p>
<p>All but one of the 72 hostages are married. A few suffer from heart disease, diabetes and other chronic ailments. Red Cross doctors ensure they get proper medication but relatives say that's small consolation.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of these are older men ... some are not in good health,&quot; said Ana Teresa Pantoja, daughter of Supreme Court president and hostage Moises Pantoja.</p>
<p>&quot;My father suffers from high blood pressure and has a heart problem, too, so we have always been worried about his health,&quot; she said this week on local television.</p>
<p>Officials close to Fujimori say privately they will try to wear down the hostage-takers rather than make concessions to a group many Peruvians consider a band of terrorists.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is ready to wait as long as it takes in order to find a peaceful solution,&quot; Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi told reporters. A source close to Fujimori said this week that &quot;the government's strategy is to wait.&quot;</p>
<p>Fujimori has refused MRTA demands for the release of jailed rebels but has arranged asylum for the hostage-takers in Cuba and the Dominican Republic and is believed to be ready to improve prison conditions -- if they free the hostages.</p>
<p>About 20 heavily armed MRTA rebels stormed a cocktail party given by Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki on Dec. 17 and took more than 500 guests hostage. They released most of the captives but kept a high-powered group including Aoki, two Cabinet ministers and Fujimori's brother.</p>
