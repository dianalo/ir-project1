<p>Motorola Inc said Thursday it sees the world semiconductor industry reaching at least the $300 billion mark in 2001 estimated by industry groups, as additional chips are used in more devices.</p>
<p>At its annual analysts' meeting, the Schaumburg, Ill.-based technology giant said it expects the number of semiconductor uses to continue to grow as well as the number of chips used in some products.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very bullish that the $300-plus billion number in 2001 is very reachable and it could potentially go higher,&quot; said Hector Ruiz, president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Group.</p>
<p>The 1996 semiconductor industry has been pegged at about $133 billion, the company said.</p>
<p>Motorola said, for example, the average number of semiconductors used in a car is expected to double between 1996 and 2001. One new model uses 700 chips, Ruiz said.</p>
<p>The switch to digital wireless phones from the analog handsets mostly used now will triple the number of chips used in the devices, he said, adding the company is allocating more resources to chips for wireless devices.</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry suffered overcapacity and a cyclical downturn in 1996, when worldwide revenues dropped nine percent, but Motorola said it sees industry growth of six to eight percent this year. Excluding the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market, the company said that number could reach 12 to 15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the recovery to strengthen as the year continues,&quot; Ruiz said.</p>
<p>Motorola took a $170 million pretax charge in the second quarter related to its exit of the DRAM market, which is a highly competitive, commodity market.</p>
