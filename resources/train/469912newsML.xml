<p>The state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) said on Wednesday the Commerce Ministry had instructed it to tender for 50,000 tonnes of crystal white refined sugar for delivery by end-June or early July.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will issue the tender this week or early next week,&quot; a TCP official told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said 50,000 tonnes of sugar would be imported in cargoes of 12,500 tonnes each for shipment by end-June or early July.</p>
<p>&quot;We have set a late shipment date to allow more suppliers to participate in the tender,&quot; he said. &quot;We are not sure about the price but according to our information we can get an advantage of about $10 to $15 per tonne for July shipment.&quot;</p>
<p>In January the TCP imported 25,000 tonnes of sugar from the Indian Sugar General Imports &amp; Export Corporation and another 35,000 tonnes from the State Trading Corporation of India.</p>
<p>Private traders have also booked orders for the import of 150,000 tonnes this year.</p>
<p>Local sugar output had reached 1.675 million tonnes by February 28, against 1.966 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Sugar Mills Association said sugar production was likely to be around 2.65 million tonnes in 1996/97 (July-June) compared to 2.47 million in 1995/97 and three million in 1994/95.</p>
