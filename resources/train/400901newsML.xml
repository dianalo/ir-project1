<title>BRAZIL: First Brazil soy cargo starts loading at Paranagua.</title>
<headline>First Brazil soy cargo starts loading at Paranagua.</headline>

<p>The first shipment of Brazilian soybeans from the 1996/97 crop destined for international markets began loading at the port of Paranagua on Monday, port officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>The vessel, Anastassia, was loading 44,000 tonnes destined for Rotterdam. In addition, two other vessels were docked at the export terminal and loading soymeal.</p>
<p>The Belchatom, due to load a total of 53,416 tonnes of soymeal, on Monday loaded 10,740 tonnes and was expected to complete loading by Feb 26.</p>
<p>The Theomymphis, scheduled to load 49,750 tonnes of soymeal, docked on Monday night and was scheduled to begin loading on Tuesday, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>There were 12 vessels waiting to dock, of which five were due to load soybeans and the rest soymeal, the statement said.</p>
<p>Although the export terminal reopened last week following routine maintenance, a delay in the harvest of the early-cycle crop in Parana because of heavy rains meant there was not enough product to cover commitments.</p>
<p>There was still a lack of fresh product, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Growers were having problems transporting the harvest by road, the press release said.</p>
<p>&quot;The hurdle to exports of soybeans is in the transport of the harvest from the west of the state, as it is done by trucks. The harvest in the north is also transported by rail,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that the trucks are transporting the harvest from Mato Grosso and inflating market prices,&quot; it added. &quot;Parana exporters felt this immediately and have gone to paying 30 reais ($28.6) per tonne of soybean transported instead of 20 reais.&quot;</p>
<p>Export facilities at Paranagua will operate 24 hours a day in order to handle the harvest, which port authorities expect to be short but intense.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole infrastructure of the export terminal has been mobilised to attend to the arrival and loading of soybeans and soymeal,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Brazil should see record production in 1996/97 with a total crop of 26.5 million tonnes, of which Parana will account for 6.2 to 6.4 million, port authorities forecast.</p>
