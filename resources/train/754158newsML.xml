<title>UK: NWE fuel oil flat, high sulphur finely balanced.</title>

<p>NWE high sulphur cracked fuel was steady on Thursday amid flat crude and unchanged supply/demand factors, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges traded at $90.25 fob Rotterdam and $91.00 fob Antwerp while high sulphur cracked cargoes were pegged steady at $84-86 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Dealers said the NWE barge market was finely balanced with tight supplies matched by slim demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian exports have been less than expected, but the market could easily turn either way,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Fuel was looking more bullish and barges consolidating past $90.00 could trigger some renewed buying. But, moves higher are likely to be capped by limited end-user interest.</p>
<p>&quot;$80-90 has remained a range since late February,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>If a deal is concluded today the level was expected to be around $85 cif NWE, on the basis of no sudden changes in crude.</p>
<p>Low sulphur fuel was steady with cargoes pegged around $94 fob NWE and market talk was of continued slowness in part because the main Med buyer was noticeably quiet.</p>
