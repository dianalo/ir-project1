<p>French President Jacques Chirac visits Romania from Friday to back its outsider bid to be among the first East European nations to join NATO, and to endorse Bucharest's new push to ditch the legacy of communism.</p>
<p>Chirac, the most senior Western leader to visit Romania since his late Socialist predecessor Francois Mitterrand in 1991, will also bless the centrist government's goal of joining the European Union, without setting a target date for accession.</p>
<p>Accompanied by investors including film star Gerard Depardieu, interested in enterprises such as wine and theatre, Chirac's two-day visit will mark a new warmth in western ties since President Emil Constantinescu was elected in November.</p>
<p>Most western leaders were reluctant to visit ex-president Ion Ilieuscu, an ex-communist who had been in power since 1989 until Constantinescu defeated him. The new government has promised to open the economy and to crack down on corruption.</p>
<p>French officials said Chirac would reiterate support for Romania's drive for NATO membership when he addresses a joint session of parliament and a has question-and-answer session with university students.</p>
<p>Chirac told Constantinescu in Paris this month that France &quot;would plead strongly with its allies&quot; for Romania to be among the first countries invited to join the 16-nation alliance at a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials accompanying Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a round-the-world tour this week said Romania was still a &quot;long shot&quot; compared with favourites Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect (Chirac) to reiterate officially France's support for Romania's first-wave integration into NATO,&quot; Romania's European Integration Minister Alexandru Herlea told Reuters in Bucharest. &quot;Adherence to NATO would also be a good signal for our integration into the European Union.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our ties with France, which had been marred by the miners' incursions in 1990 and 1991, are getting back to normal now,&quot; he added. The riots, aimed at reversing market reforms, led to the ouster of reformist prime minister Petre Roman.</p>
<p>Constantinescu said in Paris he had found &quot;a true friend&quot; in France, a strong ally of Romania in the 19th and early 20th centuries. He urged Paris to act again as Bucharest's &quot;sponsor&quot; for closer ties with NATO and the EU.</p>
<p>The trip is part of Chirac's efforts to raise France's profile in Eastern Europe, where Germany has taken a lead. On visits to Poland in September and Hungary in January, he endorsed their wish for EU membership by the year 2000.</p>
<p>He is likely to repeat the 2000 target when he visits the Czech Republic in April, but all sides admit that reforms are not as far advanced in Romania.</p>
<p>&quot;The year 2000 is not a phrase that Chirac will use in Romania, but Romania will be on the same starting line as the other candidate countries when admission talks begin,&quot; a French official said.</p>
<p>Chirac will also promote cultural ties with Romania, a member of the 51-nation &quot;Francophonie&quot; group of nations that use French. Elderly residents of Bucharest refer to the city as &quot;Little Paris of the East&quot;.</p>
<p>France helped create modern Romania by supporting the 1859 union of the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia and then helping the emergence of Greater Romania in 1918, when Transylvania joined the Romanian kingdom.</p>
