<p>Refugees and other Bosnian citizens in Croatia, watched by 260 international monitors, began two days of advance voting on Saturday in Bosnia's first postwar elections.</p>
<p>The in-country election day for Bosnia is September 14. But some 640,000 Bosnian citizens abroad, a vast majority of them refugees from the 1992-95 war, were called on to vote in 55 countries over one week from last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of 117,421 eligible Bosnian citizens in Croatia, 35 percent turned out at 86 polling stations throughout the country by the 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) close of Saturday's voting, Croatia's central electoral commission said.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been some technical problems but according to the information we have now we haven't had any major problems,&quot; Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) liaison officer Maria Emilia Arioli told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, these elections are running.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the 1995 Dayton peace treaty, Moslem, Serb and Croat citizens of Bosnia living abroad or displaced within Bosnia may vote for representatives in their pre-war addresses.</p>
<p>Three million people in all are called on to elect a three-member Bosnian presidency and multi-ethnic parliament to govern a loose union of Serb and Moslem-Croat entities.</p>
<p>Voting is supposed to lay foundations for a democratic reunification of a country torn along communal lines, but analysts believe the three dominant Serb, Moslem and Croat nationalist parties are likely to win.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little hope for things to change after this election but still it's better than nothing. It's a step forward,&quot; said Zvonimir Komarica, a Croat refugee from Bosnain Serb northern stronghold of Banja Luka.</p>
<p>Polls were open for 12 hours on Saturday and will reopen for the same period on Sunday, supervised by 260 monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other international agencies.</p>
<p>Ballots from all polling places abroad will be sent to the Sarajevo office of the OSCE, which is running the elections, and counted along with those from the in-country voting. Final results will not be announced until later in September.</p>
<p>Two three-member OSCE supervision teams toured 18 Croatian polling stations, improvised in primary schools and social welfare centres in the Croatian capital on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to make sure that people have secure places to vote, that there are no manipulations, no party posters,&quot; Caroline Katan, an OSCE team member, told Reuters.</p>
<p>OSCE sources said some refugees complained at finding only Serb candidates entered on ballot forms for formerly Moslem- and Croat-populated towns in Serb-controlled Bosnia. &quot;They are sad and bitter about this,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>In the Adriatic coast town of Dubrovnik, several hundred Croat refugees from Serb-held Trebinje in nearby Bosnia refused to vote in protest at ballots printed only in Serb Cyrillic script and showing only Serb candidates.</p>
<p>In another incident, supporters of exiled Bosnian Moslem warlord Fikret Abdic voting at Gasinci refugee camp accused the local electoral commission of contriving to have disabled and uneducated people vote for Bosnia's central government SDA party.</p>
<p>They said that to test the committee, a pro-Abdic voter went into the booth posing as a blind man and a commission member ticked off SDA candidates on the ballot form instead of Abdic party candidates as he had asked for.</p>
<p>Arioli said most incidents could blamed on &quot;technical reasons&quot; caused by the complexity of the voting system.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to find practical solutions and we are continuously in contact with Sarajevo and (OSCE headquarters in) Vienna,&quot; she said.</p>
