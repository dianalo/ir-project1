<title>UK: Minor metals - Bismuth scarce as China holds back.</title>
<headline>Minor metals - Bismuth scarce as China holds back.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>A tight nearby physical market saw bismuth extend its rise over the past week and traders asked by Reuters are now expecting prices to move above $4.00 a pound towards $4.50 a pound in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the minor metals sector cobalt players digested news that producer Gecamines was moving material by airfreight.</p>
<p>Low stocks, increased consumer demand and a hint of speculative interest helped to keep bismuth on the boil. Major producer China was said to be running low stocks and were not keen sellers into a rising market.</p>
<p>China is the only place you can get bismuth at the moment,&quot; one trader commented, &quot;but they are holding back on what material they have.&quot;</p>
<p>Other producers such as Mexico and Peru are said to be sold out following recent brisk enquiry from consumers.</p>
<p>In cobalt Zaire's (now Democratic Republic of Congo)  state run mining company Gecamines had been recently believed to be not moving material from its dilapidated, investment starved facilities in the Shaba region.</p>
<p>But news on Thursday that Gecamines is airfreighting cobalt into Europe surprised several London traders.</p>
<p>A senior Gecamines official told Reuters by phone from Lubumbashi, &quot;We seeking to profit from high prices. Roads are too slow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the official noted cobalt prices were now starting to fall.</p>
<p>Traders noted news that mining deals struck with the previous government will have to be renegotiated under the new administration.</p>
<p>The continued civil unrest in the capital, Kinshasa,  since Kabila's victory was not seen likely to make much difference to an already unreliable cobalt supply situation from the country's mining region.</p>
<p>Zambia, another producer of cobalt was said to be experiencing production problems. American producers were said to be running low stock levels.</p>
<p>Players of cobalt are eyeing the developments at Canadian producer Inco where workers and management are still far apart on pay ideas in their labour contract negotiations. The current contract expires at midnight on Saturday May 31 and union negotiators have a strike mandate.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the union representing the 4,700 workers rejected the latest contract offer.</p>
<p>Despite renewed Japanese consumer demand indium dipped below $300 a kilo under long liquidation and profit-taking. But traders said the downturn was likely to be short-lived as they believed buyers in Japan, a major user of the hi-tech metal, would start covering their commitments. &quot;Prices are set to turn towards the end of 1997,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Low stocks and an uptick in end-user demand helped to lift magnesium, which seems to have absorbed recent market talk of Russian stockpile sales.</p>
<p>Traders noted news that European producer Norsk Hydro had raised is price just ahead of talks between Japanese traders and end-users on domestic third-quarter prices.</p>
<p>Last Friday Norsk Hydro said its was raising its European producer price for pure magnesium to 5.55DM/kg, from 5.40 DM/kg.</p>
<p>Low Russian stocks and Japanese demand underpinned gallium, while end-user demand and falling Chinese exports was seen supportive of molybdendum.</p>
