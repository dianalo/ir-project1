<p>Colombia's state-run oil company said Monday it would take at least four or five days to repair the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline which was ruptured in three places over the weekend.</p>
<p>The pipeline, the second largest in the country with capacity to pump 250,000 barrels a day (bpd), was dynamited twice by leftist guerrillas over the weekend and was also partially destroyed by a landslide.  </p>
<p>&quot;It will take a minimum of four or five days to repair the pipeline especially at the point where the landslide occurred because we have to repair the road, which was also destroyed, at the same time,&quot; an Ecopetrol spokesman said.</p>
<p>Pumping along the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline has been suspended since another rebel attack last Wednesday. It has now been blown up 45 times this year -- the same number of times as in the whole of last year.</p>
<p>The Ecopetrol spokesman said some crude had spilled into the River Nuevo Presidente near the northeast town of Saravena after the first of the weekend bombings Saturday. Venezuelan authorities have also been alerted to prevent the spillage flowing across the border and toward Lake Maracaibo.</p>
<p>The attacks and landslide have forced Ecopetrol and Occidental Petroleum Corp to raise the possibility of declaring force majeure on production and export of crude. The two companies, associate partners, declared force majeure after back-to-back pipeline bombings midway through last month.</p>
