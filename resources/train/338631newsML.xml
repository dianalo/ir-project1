<p>NWE gas oil premiums eased on Tuesday as prompt demand remained slack but IPE futures strengthened, pushing outright prices higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Heating oil premiums were $1-$2 a tonne weaker, while diesel held firm. Feb IPE gas oil was up $2 at $201.75 by 1300 GMT, playing catch-up to crude's overnight gains.</p>
<p>Slow barge demand trimmed ARA premiums with a Feb 1-15 refinery barge trading mid-morning at Feb IPE +$3 fob Rotterdam, $1.50 off Monday's levels.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no sense of urgency, demand has just filtered away,&quot; said one barge trader.</p>
<p>Another trader said German buying interest was lacking, depressed by high stock levels and some disruption to traffic because of ice.</p>
<p>Cargo business was also slack with German heating oil pegged around Feb IPE +$6 for Feb 1-15 and FOD around Feb IPE +$5.50-$6.50 for the same period.</p>
<p>Early February Russians were offered at Feb IPE +$4, about $1 weaker than Monday, but were not attracting any interest.</p>
<p>Diesel barges were on offer at Feb IPE +$14 fob ARA for Feb 1-15, also against little interest, traders said.</p>
