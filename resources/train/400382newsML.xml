<p>The South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) turned to the untried Carel du Plessis to replace disgraced Andre Markgraaff as Springbok coach on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Described in his playing days as the &quot;prince of wings&quot;, Du Plessis, 36, becomes the youngest coach in the Springboks history.</p>
<p>He has the dual responsibility of leading his country through a gruelling 13 internationals in 1997 as well as healing some of the game's self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not only about obtaining results. It's also the showcase which SARFU has to present to the rugby public, the disadvantaged communities and internationally,&quot; said du Plessis.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that I can perform the job of coach at a high level because it's not always about experience. It's about vision, it's about equipping players for test rugby.&quot;</p>
<p>The former Western Province and Springbok winger -- unrelated to South Africa's World Cup winning manager Morne du Plessis -- retired at the age of 29 as sporting isolation limited his international career to just 12 tests between 1982 and 1989.</p>
<p>Since quitting rugby he has made a career as a gilts trader and is a partner in a Cape Town corporate services company.</p>
<p>He returned to the game in an official capacity only when Markgraaff employed him as tactical adviser during the Springboks' five-test clean sweep on their tour of Argentina, France and Wales.</p>
<p>&quot;Carel is a great leader and visionary and he possesses a shrewd rugby mind,&quot; said SARFU chief executive Rian Oberholzer.</p>
<p>&quot;The executive committee of SARFU are confident that he can knit together the different strands of Springbok rugby and come up with a winning combination.&quot;</p>
<p>Du Plessis captained Western Province during a golden era in the 1980s, playing alongside brothers Willie and Michael.</p>
<p>A new manager is expected to be announced next week along with a backroom team. The roles of manager and coach had been united under Markgraaff but have again been divided.</p>
<p>Markgraaff resigned last week after a secret tape recording was published of a conversation in which he made racist remarks against black sports officials.</p>
