<p>Zairean rebels have said they are ready to begin talks on ending the country's civil war but a Kinshasa government official said his side is not authorised to start negotiations.</p>
<p>Bizima Karaha, foreign affairs spokesman for rebel leader Laurent Kabila, told BBC radio he believed the government had a mandate to begin talks in South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;There are representatives from the government and the president's office here and I think for the first time these people will have a full mandate to start serious negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kabila and a small rebel delegation arrived in South Africa on Tuesday as part of attempts by the South African government to get the two warring sides together for face-to-face talks.</p>
<p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is represented in South Africa by his nephew and security adviser Honore Ngbanda Nzambo Ko Ayumba, who held talks with President Nelson Mandela earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>Asked if the rebel delegation had met Ngbanda, Karaha said: &quot;No, we haven't because we believe that until such time there is an agenda on which we could meet and talk about there is no reason why we should meet.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have conditions for talks, all that we want is peace. Our movement is fighting for a united democratic, prosperous country where human rights can be respected, including the rights of all the minority.&quot;</p>
<p>But in France, where Mobutu is recovering from prostate cancer surgery and radiation treatments carried out in Switzerland last year, the president's spokesman said Ngbanda was not authorised to speak on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>&quot;He has no authority to do that kind of thing,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters. &quot;He is in South Africa for personal reasons. He was in no way sent there to negotiate.&quot;</p>
<p>The spokesman insisted Mobutu would not agree to negotiations until all foreign soldiers had withdrawn from Zairean soil.</p>
<p>Zaire has accused Uganda and Tutsi-led Rwanda and Burundi of supporting the rebels, many of whom are ethnic Tutsis. But Zaire's three eastern neighbours have denied involvement in the war, which began last October when the rebels took up arms.</p>
<p>In the Zairean capital Kinshasa, the government accused Kabila of being a puppet but said it was open to the idea of a regional conference in March, provided all foreign troops left the area.</p>
<p>African foreign ministers agreed in Tripoli on Thursday that Togo should host an emergency summit on Zaire on March 18 and 19. Mandela has said he will meet Mobutu at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not understand how the United States can be pushing us to negotiate with Kabila after recognising that Zaire has been the victim of foreign aggression,&quot; Pascale Dema, Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo's spokesman, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider him a puppet,&quot; he said, referring to Kabila, who had talks with Mandela on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are, however, open to the idea of a regional conference provided that the U.N. resolutions of February 19 calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops are applied,&quot; Dema said.</p>
<p>The rebel delegation in Pretoria has held talks with George Moose, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African development.</p>
