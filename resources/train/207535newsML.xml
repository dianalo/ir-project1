<p>The British economy grew by 0.8 percent in the third quarter as consumer spending continued to power ahead, official figures out on Thursday showed.</p>
<p>Revised figures from the Office for National Statistics showed gross domestic product was 2.4 percent up on a year ago while consumer spending has leapt 1.1 percent since the second quarter and 3.3 percent from last year.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the highest year-on-year rise since 1989 and confirms the message given by most of the recent data,&quot; said Andy Cates, UK economist at UBS.</p>
<p>That message has been coming across loud and clear -- high street spending is racing ahead. In October, retail sales were 4.1 percent higher year-on-year while bank and building society lending to the private sector soared by 7.4 billion pounds ($12.46 billion).</p>
<p>Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica, said Thursday's GDP figures suggested consumer spending in the third quarter was even stronger than recent sales data suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;A fairly decent gain of 1.1 percent in consumer spending suggests that retail sales in the third quarter gave a slightly misleading negative impression of consumer sentiment. Overall, consumption appears to be picking up rather more strongly.&quot;</p>
<p>Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Plc, said UK markets would be concerned by the inflation threat posed by escalating high street spending. &quot;The headline numbers are as expected but I don't think we can take much comfort from the detail.&quot;</p>
<p>He also noted the GDP deflator, a government measure for inflation factored into GDP calculations, was 2.9 percent higher year-on-year.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a very sharp rise in the GDP deflator. This is indicative of a general upturn in inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>Cates at UBS noted yet another inflationary threat highlighted by the figures -- insufficient capital investment.</p>
<p>Gross domestic fixed capital formation actually fell by 2.2 percent in the third quarter, showing Britain's economy remains a twin-track one, boasting high consumer demand but paltry levels of investment.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are to prevent the economy from overheating, we do need to see more capital expenditure,&quot; Cates said.</p>
<p>If domestic demand is not met by domestic producers, imports will rise. That could fuel inflation, particularly if the pound's recent strength -- it has risen about 10 percent since early August -- starts to fade.</p>
<p>Cates forecast official interest rates will rise by a further 75 basis points over the course of next year, from 6.00 percent now. But he said weak demand from Europe would make it difficult for the UK economy to overheat radically, as would the pound's strength. As the pound rises, UK exports become more expensive while imports cheapen. So British manufacturers will continue to struggle abroad and even if consumers turn to imported goods en masse, inflation will not rocket.</p>
<p>With revised current account figures, released alongside the GDP data, showing Britain was in credit with the rest of the world to the tune of 792 million pounds in the second quarter, there is little reason for sterling to fall, analysts said.</p>
<p>Angela Knight, economic secretary to the Treasury, said that was the best balance of payments performance in a decade.</p>
<p>Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, joined the chorus of economists saying the British consumer remains the driving force behind the economy's growth.</p>
<p>But he was less concerned by the inflationary implications of Thursday's figures, noting that stockbuilding -- companies making goods and shelving them in anticipation of future demand -- had added 0.2 percent to third quarter GDP growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Stripping this effect out, underlying domestic demand actually grew a relatively modest 0.5 percent on the quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>He also forecast a pick-up in investment next year, despite its third quarter fall. &quot;With corporate borrowing strong and business optimism rising, we expect investment to grow strongly in the coming year.&quot;</p>
