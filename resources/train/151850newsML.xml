<headline>Beijing mayor Li Qiyan resigns.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-10-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Beijing People's Congress on Monday approved the resignation of Mayor Li Qiyan, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jia Qinglin, Communist Party secretary of the southeastern province of Fujian, was appointed acting mayor, Xinhua said. It gave no reason for Li's resignation.  </p>
<p>Li would become secretary of the Labour Ministry's Communist Party committee, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Chinese sources have said Li stepped down because of his links to Chen Xitong, who resigned as Communist Party boss of Beijing in 1995 after his protege, a vice-mayor, came under investigation for economic crimes and committed suicide.</p>
<p>Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.</p>
<p>Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party. Courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.</p>
