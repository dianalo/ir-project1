<p>A 1,000 rise in jobless claims for the week ended February 15 was not substantial, but the continued downward trend over the past few weeks suggests U.S. labor market conditions are strengthening, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;It suggests the employment report for the month of February is going to be on the strong side,&quot; said Michael Strauss, senior vice president and chief economist at Sanwa Securities (USA) Co.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment insurance rose to 309,000 in the week ended February 15 from a revised 308,000 in the prior week. Wall Street economists in a Reuters poll had forecast initial claims of 323,000.</p>
<p>The four week moving average fell to 318,250 from a revised 325,500.</p>
<p>Dan Seto, senior economist at The Nikko Securities Co International Inc, noted that the four week moving average in claims has been on a steady decline since January, from roughly 350,000 to the current level.  </p>
<p>&quot;A 30,000 drop is significant,&quot; asserted Seto. &quot;Obviously this is another signal that labor markets are very tight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Seto said that as many companies begin to hold back on layoffs, the economy is running with a limited supply of unemployed workers.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look strictly at jobless claims and its implications for employment, you should be looking at a very strong (February payroll) number,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Sanwa's Strauss agreed. He said the financial markets can expect to see a drop in the February unemployment rate.  </p>
<p>&quot;You are probably going to get a very strong rebound in the workweek statistics, a very strong rebound in the wage components, and that is going to be a little bit disturbing for the (Treasury) market when it comes out in two weeks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond was off about 6/32 before the claims number was released at 0830 EST/1330 GMT. The bellwether bond slipped an additional 4/32 in the wake of the report.</p>
<p>By 0950 EST/1450 GMT the long bond pared its losses to down 6/32 to yield 6.59 percent.</p>
