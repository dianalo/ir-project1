<p>A Canadian woman, allegedly abducted by her estranged husband, was found dead on Wednesday after an all-out search by the Mounties through the wilds of northern Alberta.</p>
<p>Police told reporters they found the body of Carol Meredith, 29, in the bush in a van near the remote town of Cold Lake, 367 miles (590 km) northeast of Calgary in the western Canadian province.</p>
<p>The discovery ended a sensational hunt for Meredith and her husband, 29-year-old Barclay MacFie, that started on July 31. Meredith was last reported by witnesses being dragged kicking and screaming into a van from a relative's home in Cold Lake wearing only a T-shirt and her underwear.</p>
<p>The kidnapping, which dominated headlines across Canada, occurred just three days after Meredith was abducted from her Calgary home at midnight and held for two hours, prompting local police to issue a warrant for MacFie's arrest on charges of kidnapping and sexual assault.</p>
<p>More than 30 Mounties and Canadian soldiers scoured the sparsely populated northeastern Alberta until late on Wednesday on foot and by helicopter searching for Meredith and the Ford Econoline van.</p>
<p>Cause of death for Meredith was not immediately released.</p>
<p>Meredith had reportedly told relatives in early June she wanted to separate from MacFie. The couple lived in Calgary.</p>
<p>MacFie was arrested late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But he refused to tell police Meredith's whereabouts. He appeared in court on Wednesday and was to remain in custody until his trial on August 27.</p>
<p>Police said MacFie's arrest came after his dead wife's brother, Gord Meredith, noticed MacFie in the back of a gas station and bus depot. Gord Meredith, Carol's sister Terry Little and Sharon Meredith -- wife of Carol's other brother Bob -- were inside at the time putting up posters asking the public for information.</p>
<p>MacFie tried to hide in a storage room at the gas station before his discovery and arrest. He went with police without incident, police said.</p>
<p>MacFie was being held on a total of 10 charges, including kidnapping, attempted murder, sexual and aggravated assault and breaking and entering.</p>
