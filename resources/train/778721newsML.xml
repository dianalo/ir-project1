<p>New violence erupted in French Guiana on Monday night as police and demonstrators clashed in the capital, Cayenne, after a judicial procedure that kept an independence leader in pre-trial detention, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Paramilitary riot police used tear gas to disperse several hundred demonstrators who had camped out in front of the central courthouse for several hours.</p>
<p>The acrid smell of tear gas penetrated into homes of nearby residents and riot police were patrolling the city and guarding strategic locations.</p>
<p>Local state-owned radio said demonstrators attempted to set fire to the town's central police station and electricity was cut in certain sections.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of injuries.</p>
<p>The violence was triggered by the arrest last month of Jean-Victor Castor, a leading member of French Guiana's independence movement. He is accused of violence against a policeman during a wave of riots in April that left nine police injured, eight by gunfire.</p>
<p>April's riots were sparked by the arrest of 10 other members of the independence movement for an attack on the residence of the French territory's state prosecutor during a wave of riots in November 1996.</p>
<p>The violence has shattered French Guiana's tranquil facade and laid bare economic, political and social woes.</p>
<p>French Guiana is the only non-indpendent territory on the mainland of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>It lags behind mainland France in housing, education and health care. Official unemployment of the population of 150,000 exceeds 25 percent and the economy is heavily dependent on French subsidies.</p>
