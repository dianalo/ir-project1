<title>NETHERLANDS: Nutricia repeats no contaminants found in Milumil.</title>
<headline>Nutricia repeats no contaminants found in Milumil.</headline>

<p>Nutricia NV on Tuesday repeated that British health authorities had not been able to find any contaminants in its Milumil baby milk powder, withdrawn in January because of a possible link with salmonella poisoning.</p>
<p>&quot;The UK authorities have done their utmost and concluded there was only one possible source (of salmonella infection), but they have not been able to find anything in the product (Milumil), the factory or the raw materials,&quot; said Klaas de Jong, a member of the Dutch food group's management.</p>
<p>He said Nutricia had taken every precaution, acting as if it had been proven that its products had caused the infections.</p>
<p>But neither Nutricia nor British authorities, with whom it has been working closely, had found any such evidence, he said.</p>
<p>De Jong said Nutricia's statements did not contradict those of Britain's Department of Health which said tests had shown an &quot;association&quot; between salmonella anatum and Milumil.</p>
<p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said on Tuesday that &quot;the company accepted that the epidemiological evidence and microbiological analysis of cases demonstrated an association between salmonella anatum in infants and Milumil.&quot;</p>
<p>De Jong also confirmed that Nutricia and the Department of Health had been discussing what steps need to be taken next with a view to the safe reintroduction of the product which Nutricia has said is sold only in Britain and Ireland.</p>
