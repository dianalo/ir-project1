<p>Tony Blair, Britain's youngest prime minister since 1812, celebrated his 44th birthday on Tuesday at the head of a team of ministers hoping to transform the country.</p>
<p>After leading the Labour Party to the biggest election victory in its history, Blair immediately sent one of his new ministers, Doug Henderson, to Brussels promising a fresh start in relations with the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe, for the new government is an opportunity, not a threat,&quot; Henderson said, striking a tone which contrasted sharply with the ousted Eurosceptic Conservatives fearful of a federal Europe.</p>
<p>Henderson, a marathon runner and mountaineer who faces an uphill climb reversing two decades of distrust, confirmed that Labour would end the British opt-out from the EU's Social Charter on worker rights.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, also adopting a much more Euro-friendly stancew, said: &quot;If we just shout all the time as the Conservatives did, then eventually people will ignore you.&quot;</p>
<p>On his first working day at the Foreign Office, Cook also said he was keen to ensure a smooth handover when Hong Kong returned to China next month after 156 years of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>Blair, whose party won a 179-seat majority in the 659-member parliament in last Thursday's elections after 18 years in the political wilderness, put the finishing touches on Monday to his government.</p>
<p>A modernist who dumped much of the party's socialist dogma to woo back voters, he included a record 19 women in Labour's first government since 1979.</p>
<p>They included left-winger Dawn Primarolo as financial secretary to the treasury and dual Hollywood Oscar winner Glenda Jackson as junior environment and transport minister.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise was the choice of maverick left-winger Tony Banks as sports minister. Banks, a fervent supporter of Chelsea football club in London, once called former premier Margaret Thatcher &quot;a poor, half mad old cow.&quot;</p>
<p>In his first week in office, Blair will immediately be confronted with two of the thorniest foreign policy issues.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton arrives for talks aimed at reviving the flagging Northern Ireland peace process, which stalled amid inter-party wrangling and the Irish Republican Army's guerrilla war against British targets.</p>
<p>On Friday, Blair meets Prime Minister Wim Kok of the Netherlands, the current EU president and host for a crucial summit next month that could decide the EU's future direction.</p>
<p>The shell-shocked Conservatives, demoralised by their worst electoral drubbing for 150 years, are now feuding over a replacement for defeated prime minister John Major.</p>
<p>The latest contender to pitch his hat into the ring was right-winger John Redwood, who unsuccessfully challenged Major in a 1995 leadership contest.</p>
<p>Insisting that he could pull together a party split down the middle over Britain's role in Europe, Redwood wrote in the London Times: &quot;I can't defend the past, I can unite the party.&quot;</p>
<p>Kenneth Clarke, a pro-European former finance minister, and right-winger Peter Lilley are already candidates for the Coinservative leadership and former interior minister Michael Howard is expected to join the field.</p>
