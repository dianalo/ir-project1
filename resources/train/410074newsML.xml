<p>Komercni Banka a.s., the largest Czech commercial bank, on Friday said its 1996 net profit edged up slightly, but the rise failed to impress analysts who had expected more.</p>
<p>Komercni said its preliminary 1996 net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, was 5.24 billion crowns ($179.8 million), up from a previous 5.1 billion.</p>
<p>It added, however, that its pre-tax profit for the year was down to 5.37 billion crowns from 5.73 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>But analysts said that given a sharp rise in Czech interest rates last year, coupled with the benefits Komercni felt from a crisis at smaller banks, its results should have been better.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase is only 2.5 percent which is quite disappointing,&quot; said Martin Nejedly, a banking analyst at Wood and Company.</p>
<p>&quot;Komercni itself was not hit by the crisis, and in fact, benefited because it attracted a lot of deposits from troubled banks and these are relatively cheap sources of cash,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Last June the Czech central bank raised its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, which in turn boosted interbank money market rates to above 13 percent for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Several smaller Czech banks were put under central bank administration or shut last year, bruising the sector's image.</p>
<p>The problems peaked in September, when the fifth largest bank, Agrobanka a.s., went into forced administration because of low liquidity connected to the failure of a smaller Plzen-based bank, Kreditni Banka a.s..</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a bad result, but the figures could have been better, especially according to pre-tax profits,&quot; said another local analyst.</p>
<p>Komercni did not release detailed figures of deposits and loans, but did say its assets rose to 448.3 billion crowns from 387.9 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Komercni shares have been at the heart of the Prague Stock Exchange's bull run in 1997, gaining over 20 percent since trading resumed from the Christmas break.</p>
<p>But the issue ran out of steam this week after the market peaked on Tuesday, and has dropped over 200 crowns since to close on Friday at 2,750 on a round of profit-taking.</p>
<p>Dan Gladis of brokerage Atlantik Financi Trhy, however, said he was pleased with the result and optimistic that it would translate into another bull run for the issue beginning next week.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw Komercni shares rise about 20 crowns on the OTC (over the counter) market after the results were announced though trading was low since it is late on Friday,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the shares could begin rising again on Monday when the market gets into full swing.&quot;</p>
<p>Komercni's Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) in London fell immediately after the news, trading at 35 pounds, off 1.85 on the day.</p>
