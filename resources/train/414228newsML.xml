<headline>UK's FTSE shrugs of Dow weakness to close steady.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>London's FTSE 100 share index fought off an early attack of Wall Street-inspired weakness to end little changed on Monday as investors tried to ignore fears of further losses across the Atlantic, dealers said.</p>
<p>Expectations of continued inflows of cash from private investors helped support the London market and cushion the impact of a faltering Wall Street. But with more testimony from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and key U.S. data looming, markets would remain on edge, dealers said.</p>
<p>The FTSE ended 1.2 points down at 4,307.1, its highest point of the day, after dropping as low as 4,287.3 in early trade.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've done remarkably well considering the state of Wall Street,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;The Dow has come off more than 150 points in the last few days and we have been coping well.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said more money was expected this month from private investors, ahead of the April deadline for investing in Personal Equity Plans (PEPs), a tax-efficient method of share ownership.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got another month in which all this PEP money will be coming in, so market-makers are trying not to get caught too short,&quot; one said. &quot;That's helping us hold fairly steady.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said markets were awaiting the second half of Greenspan's Humphrey Hawkins testimony on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Last week Greenspan sent stock markets sharply lower with a warning that Wall Street's recent rise has &quot;rasied questions of sustainability.&quot; The February U.S. employment report on Friday will also be a key focus for markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the noise this week is about the results from companies here and some individual stocks will no doubt be affected, but we have the non-farms at the end of the week and that is what everybody is going to be looking at,&quot; said Philip Isherwood, UK strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>Ex-dividends took 3.45 points off the FTSE on Monday morning and without their impact the index would have ended higher.  </p>
<p>Advancing shares outnumbered declining shares by 52-45 but a few blue-chips took a tumble and weighed the index down.</p>
<p>Chief among them was National Westminster Bank Plc which dropped 28p to 730-1/2 after the announcement of a 50 million stg loss on options trading. The shares also went ex-dividend, compounding their weakness.</p>
<p>Most other major banking stocks were weaker too, with only Standard Chartered Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland going strongly against the trend.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered ended 25p firmer at 866-1/2 as positive sentiment after its results last week continued.  </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc, which reported a 23-percent rise in 1996 profits, finished down 30-1/2p at 15.515 stg. Chief executive John Bond predicted a challenging year ahead with increasing competition.</p>
<p>Business services group Hays Plc also suffered after releasing results, ending 15p lower at 536.</p>
<p>Vague bid talk continued to boost insurance shares, with Commercial Union Plc climbing 35-1/2p to 718-1/2.</p>
<p>Volume on SEAQ was an impressive 1.4 billion by 1635 GMT but dealers said this had been distorted by Yorkshire Water Plc and Southern Electric Plc's share buy-backs</p>
<p>The two companies contributed more than half the total volume on SEAQ and trade had in fact been relatively quiet, dealers said.</p>
