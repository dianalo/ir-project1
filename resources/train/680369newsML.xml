<title>USA: OPTIONS - Dollar/yen vols stay offered after G7.</title>
<headline>OPTIONS - Dollar/yen vols stay offered after G7.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for front-end dollar/yen options stayed offered Monday afternoon in dull trade but had stabilized after selling off from last week's peaks hit before the uneventful Group of Seven summit.</p>
<p>&quot;People are long vol and they've definitely just unloaded a lot of it. It's just vol is offered,&quot; said one options broker. &quot;But people are just sitting around. Nothing's going through.&quot;</p>
<p>Dollar/yen by 1515 CDT/2015 GMT had pierced 115.00 and hit day's low at 114.60, well off its overnight peak near 115.60, which was just shy of trendline resistance near 115.75.  </p>
<p>At late afternoon Monday, one-month dollar/yen was quoted at 10.15/10.45 percent versus 10.0/10.4 at Europe's morning and off sharply from 10.8/11.0 percent Friday early afternoon.</p>
<p>By late Friday, vols already had begun skidding from peaks as players revised expectations of the G7 summit and decided -- correctly -- that it would not have earth-shattering effect on spot, said Alan Revercomb, options strategist, IDEA Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;Vols have eroded,&quot; he said. &quot;So as long as we are kind of orbiting 115, it's certainly not going to set fear into anyone. If we get above 116-117, you may sort of turn things around.&quot;  </p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, the one-month, 25-delta risk-reversal still strongly favored yen calls but by a much smaller margin than last week, brokers said. The demand gauge for puts and calls was quoted at roughly 1.7/2.1 points, little changed from earlier in the day and off from 2.2/2.4 Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;You still have a risk reversal that's skewed sharply to the (dollar's) downside. There's still a lot of positions on, and there's still demand for those downside strikes,&quot; said Revercomb. &quot;So I don't think the market has given up, but you may have had too many people jumping the gun last week...so you have a lot of people positioned the same way.&quot;  </p>
<p>But brokers were unsure whether the market already had factored in the Bank of Japan's Tankan report Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's (Tankan) all priced in, but I just think nobody's interested in doing anything,&quot; said the broker.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got Tankan...so there's definitely going to be a floor under volatilities,&quot; said Revercomb, who called 10.0 percent in dollar/yen &quot;a reasonable floor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if we spend more than couple days here around 115, then there'll be another round of selling,&quot; he added. &quot;If spot gets under 115, you're not going to see vols come off much.&quot;  </p>
<p>In dollar/mark, the one-month 25-delta vol stayed stuck late Monday near 8.20/8.50 percent, off slightly from the 8.30/8.60 percent quoted in Europe earlier Monday and compared to 8.40/8.70 percent seen Friday afternoon. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750)) E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
