<p>In a possible sign of easing tensions between Japan and North Korea, Pyongyang has hinted it may allow Japanese wives of North Koreans to visit Japan, Japanese government officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The decision, if carried out, would remove a key obstacle to Tokyo joining global efforts to offer food aid to the famine-hit communist nation.</p>
<p>The officials, who did want to be identified, said North Korea raised the possibility of allowing visits home during a secret meeting between the two governments last weekend in Beijing.</p>
<p>Japanese government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama, while refusing to comment directly on the issue, said Pyongyang had recently expressed optimism on the prospect of allowing Japanese wives to visit their homeland.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot comment on specific meetings, but I hear that North Korea had offered a positive suggestion on the issue of Japanese wives (in North Korea),&quot; Kajiyama told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always raised the issue of the wives, as well as suspicions of abductions and drug smuggling, during periodic contacts with North Korea, and we strongly hope they will respond to them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tokyo has long demanded that Pyongyang help locate an estimated 1,800 Japanese women who moved to North Korea from Japan with their ethnic Korean husbands in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The issue has remained dormant since the two governments broke off talks to normalise diplomatic relations in 1992.</p>
<p>Koichi Kato, a senior member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, welcomed the news as improving the chilled ties between Tokyo and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a major step to improving ties between Japan and North Korea. The move may suggest that North Korea is in a situation where it needs to resume contact with various countries,&quot; Kato told Reuters.</p>
