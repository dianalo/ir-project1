<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B shares edged higher in Thursday morning trading, buoyed by demand for recently listed shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>But turnover was relatively thin as many investors were waiting for more reports of corporate interim results and further policy changes to reform state enterprises. The reforms could boost some listed companies, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index rose 0.046 point or 0.06 percent to 74.349 on turnover of $3.834 million, compared with $4.515 million on Wednesday morning.  </p>
<p>Investors continued to pick up shares of Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co Ltd, which listed on Tuesday, as well as the recently listed Hainan Airlines Co.</p>
<p>Zhenhua Port topped the list of biggest gainers and was also the most actively traded share in morning trading on Thursday. The stock rose $0.052 or 9.85 percent to $0.580 on volume of around 1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Hainan Airlines was the second biggest gainer, rising $0.020 or 3.86 percent to $0.538.  </p>
<p>&quot;The biggest obstacle (to sharp gains) is capital, since turnover is so low,&quot; said an analyst at China Southern Securities in Shanghai. &quot;Everyone is waiting for interim results and policy changes for state enterprises.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation is mounting that Beijing would announce detailed policy measures to boost state firms as part of a major Chinese Communist Party meeting expected to be held in late September or early October, brokers said.</p>
<p>The nation's official newspapers have been carrying daily reports on the need for enterprise reform and broadly suggesting some of the state sector could be sold.  </p>
<p>Of the 46 B share isues, 38 were traded on Thursday morning with 19 gaining ground, 10 falling back and nine unchanged.</p>
<p>Domestic currency A shares fell on institutional selling amid a lack of news, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index slipped 9.533 points or 0.78 percent to 1,216.268 on turnover of 1.283 billion yuan, compared with 1.187 billion yuan on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index fell 37.713 points or 1.02 percent to 3,649.774 points. Despite the fall in the A shares, the firm tone of the B index led some brokers to predict further gains in the near term for the foreign currency shares.</p>
