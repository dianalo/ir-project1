<headline>Bright funding picture to help insulate UK gilts.</headline>

<p>The prospect of steady falls in Britain's budget deficit should offer some comfort to the gloomy UK gilt market, still smarting from disappointment that Wednesday's budget failed to punish the rampant consumer sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chancellor didn't do much in terms of macro-economic management but he did paint a positive backdrop for gilt supply,&quot; BZW gilt analyst Kevin Adams said.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown tightened fiscal policy by 5.5 billion stg but with the bulk of the tax rises aimed at the corproate sector. Analysts fear that interest rates will now have to rise to around 7.0 percent by year end to prevent an unsustainable economic boom led by surging consumer demand.</p>
<p>Brown forecast that the central government borrowing requirement (CGBR), which is mainly funded by sales of gilts, would only be 12.4 billion stg in fiscal 1997-98 (April-March), less than half last year's CGBR of 25.1 billion.</p>
<p>This means that only 16.5 billion stg more gilts need to be sold this fiscal year, once last year's overfund of 3.9 billion stg is taken into account.</p>
<p>So despite the fact that the UK is looking at its largest ever number of gilt redemptions -- 20 billion stg -- supply is likely to be the lowest for six years.</p>
<p>The Treasury said 25.1 billion stg of gilt sales were required in total this fiscal year, down from 38.9 billion in fiscal 1996-97.  </p>
<p>&quot;The supply story is definitely good news. The Bank is going to be effectively a net purchaser of gilts this year,&quot; Morgan Stanley economist Kevin Gardiner said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is only going to be enough to restrain yields in a rising yield environment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell economist Ciaran Barr said the market needed to focus on the longer term rather than worrying about the short term outlook for inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;We think there are three main things which are likely to give the market some support. The first is the independence of the Bank of England which means that there is a better chance inflation will be controlled. The second is the funding picture and the third is the EMU convergence story,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts may not do too well in absolute terms but in relative ones they're looking pretty good,&quot; he said.</p>
