<headline>Mexico's Ortiz sees strong Q1 tax performance.</headline>

<p>Mexico's Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz said on Tuesday that some Mexican tax receipts were strong in the first quarter, and both he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin hailed the economy's recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;The report that we will be sending to Congress on the fifteen of May regarding public finances will show a very strong performance of both value added tax and income tax, which shows us that the recovery is continuing at a strong pace,&quot; Ortiz told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Ortiz reiterated that he expected a relatively strong first quarter gross domestic performance (GDP) performance based on what he described as &quot;pretty strong&quot; industrial production data in the first two months of the year, and on gasoline and diesel sales.</p>
<p>He was speaking after accompanying Rubin around a half-way house for Mexican street children that is part sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank.</p>
<p>Rubin said the Mexican economy &quot;is on the right path&quot; and he heaped praise on Ortiz and Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo for helping drag the country out of its 1994-95 economic crisis.</p>
<p>But he said there were many challenges still ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports have been very successful but domestic demand still needs to increase,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The banking system is certainly healthier than it was but there are challenges,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ortiz said the Mexican government was under &quot;no illusions that we have already done enough to sustain the recovery.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the govenment's main task was to achieve that and to avoid further problems in the future.</p>
<p>Rubin was scheduled to leave Mexico on Tuesday following his brief visit accompanying U.S. Prsident Bill Clinton.</p>
