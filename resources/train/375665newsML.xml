<headline>Dollar ends mixed amid talk of official intervention.</headline>

<p>The dollar ended mixed Thursday as a German official voiced concern over its continuing strength and speculation emerged in London that central bankers had stepped in to sell dollars for yen.</p>
<p>But traders said solid economic growth in the United States, coupled with sharp gains in U.S. stock and bond markets, sustained investors' interest in the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is, the fundamentals look very good for the dollar,&quot; said Hans Boman, chief spot currency dealer at Swedbank in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar slumped after a comment late on Wednesday from Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a vice president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, who told Reuters in Bangkok, &quot;It is not in the interest of the Bundesbank that the strength of the dollar goes further and further.&quot;</p>
<p>While most long-term investors held their dollars after Gaddum's comments, short-term market players sold the U.S. currency, which fell nearly a pfennig against the German mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is nervous. The dollar keeps putting in new highs, but it retreats quickly because of fears of central bank intervention,&quot; said Chris Iggo, chief economist at BZW Securities.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.6847 marks late in New York from 1.6892 late on Wednesday, but it rose to 124.40 Japanese yen from 124.25 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders in London reported a rumour that the Bank of England had entered the market to support the yen on behalf of Japanese authorities, which promptly sent the dollar half a yen lower.</p>
<p>Though most observers were sceptical, the market's reaction highlighted its respect for official threats to intervene if the dollar's spirited rally fails to slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumour scared people off a little bit. But realistically, I don't think the central banks are going to do anything until the dollar gets to 1.75 marks,&quot; Boman said.</p>
<p>A late rally in U.S. financial markets pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above 7,000 for the first time and the benchmark 30-year Treasury up nearly one point, helping provide support for further dollar gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Dow rose 60.81 points to 7,022.44, its second straight record high. The 30-year Treasury yield fell to 6.63 percent from 6.71 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The British pound fell against the dollar and other currencies as Kenneth Clarke, Britain's finance minister, told Sky Television the pound's recent rally would reduce British inflation.</p>
<p>Clarke's comments dampened broad-based expectations of an imminent hike in official British interest rates, which had helped push the pound to a four-year high against the mark in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The British pound fell to $1.6240 from $1.6313.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.4552 Swiss francs from 1.4535 but it fell to Canadian $1.3515 from C$1.3555.</p>
<p>U.S. currency markets will close early Friday in observance of the Presidents Day holiday on Monday.</p>
