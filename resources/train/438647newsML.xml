<title>UK: BADMINTON-SUSANTI BOWS OUT OF ALL ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS.</title>
<headline>BADMINTON-SUSANTI BOWS OUT OF ALL ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Susi Susanti bowed out,</p>
<p>possibly for the last time, at the All England Championships on</p>
<p>Thursday at a tournament she virtually made her own during the</p>
<p>early 1990s.</p>
<p>The four times All England winner and ex-World and Olympic</p>
<p>champion found number two seed Gong Zhichao too strong, the</p>
<p>Chinese winning their quarter-final 11-4 11-7.</p>
<p>Susanti, 26, is seeded only joint fifth this year and her</p>
<p>days at the top level internationally may be numbered.</p>
<p>But she said after Thursday's defeat: &quot;I still want to go on</p>
<p>for a couple of years, as long as my fitness holds.&quot;</p>
<p>Susanti last month married her long time sweetheart Allan</p>
<p>Budi Kusuma, also of Indonesia. The pair made headlines round</p>
<p>the world in 1992 when, as an engaged couple, they won the</p>
<p>Olympic singles titles in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Susanti first won the All England title in 1990 and followed</p>
<p>up with further success in 1991, 1993 and 1994.</p>
<p>But on Thursday her elegant game was no match for the</p>
<p>determined Gong who at the age of 19 looks a fair bet to lift</p>
<p>the title.</p>
<p>In Friday's semifinals she will meet unseeded South Korean</p>
<p>Ra Kyung-min who ousted joint third seed Camilla Martin of</p>
<p>Denmark in a 62-minute tussle 11-7 11-12 11-6.</p>
<p>The other semifinal will be between China's world champion</p>
<p>Ye Zhaoying and unseeded compatriot Dai Yun, the woman who on</p>
<p>Wednesday eliminated top seed Mia Audina of Indonesia.</p>
<p>In the men's singles, world champion and former All England</p>
<p>title holder Heryanto Arbi reached the semifinals with a</p>
<p>three-set victory over unseeded Chinese Luo Yigang.</p>
<p>A final against Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen on</p>
<p>Saturday was looking on the cards.</p>
<p>There was something for the locals to cheer when English</p>
<p>couple Chris Hunt and Donna Kellogg reached the semifinals of</p>
<p>the mixed doubles, beating the joint fifth seeds from Russia</p>
<p>Nickoial Zuev and Marina Yakusheva in straight games.</p>
<p>The win was all the more remarkable as Hunt's breakfast</p>
<p>companion, a stranger, had collapsed and died during the meal.</p>
<p>Hunt was clearly unsettled during the day but recovered in time</p>
<p>to record the victory.</p>
