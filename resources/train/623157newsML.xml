<title>KENYA: Liberia slams Kabila over Zaire war.</title>
<headline>Liberia slams Kabila over Zaire war.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1997-05-29</dateline>

<p>Liberia's interim leader Ruth Perry said on Thursday she strongly disapproved of Laurent Kabila's takeover of former Zaire because it had come by force.</p>
<p>Perry, chairman of Liberia's Council of Ministers, said her country had suffered because of military rulers and the same would happen in the new Democratic Republic of Congo unless Kabila quickly proved his democratic credentials.</p>
<p>She also condemned Sunday's coup in Liberia's neighbour Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>&quot;What Liberia would like to say is that war isn't good. War brings destruction and loss of lives. I can't support (Kabila) until I see that he is a real force for democracy,&quot; Perry told a news conference at the end of visit to Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't even like to support any rebel leader coming to power through the barrel of the gun. For me retribution is sure,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Kabila declared himself president and changed the country's name on May 17, the day his forces seized the capital Kinshasa ending a seven-month war.</p>
<p>Most African states have voiced approval for Kabila ousting Mobutu Sese Seko, president since 1965.</p>
<p>Liberian senator Perry became chairwoman of an interrim council of state in July 1996, pending presidential elections originally scheduled for May 30 but now delayed until July 19.</p>
<p>Perry, not permitted to stand under the peace agreement, said she was confident elections would take place as planned.</p>
<p>Liberia would express its disapproval of Kabila, the Sierra Leone coup and Burundi military leader Pierre Buyoya's 1996 coup at next week's Organisation of African Unity summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, she said.</p>
<p>Freed American slaves founded Liberia in 1847. A seven-year war has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced half the population of 2.5 million.</p>
