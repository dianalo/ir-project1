<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's leading stock index climbed 1 percent as investors welcomed a sharp rally on Wall Street and poured into banking, oil and retail stocks. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,927.3, up 50.7 points, or 1.04 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX index ended the day at a record closing high, with sentiment during stock dealings boosted by early advances on Wall Street and the continuing strength of the dollar. The DAX-30 index closed at 4,421.72, up 40.03 points, or 0.91 percent. In later screen-based trade, the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,458.66, up 80.96 points, or 1.85 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Stocks rose sharply and established a fresh closing high but ended below an all-time intraday high reached earlier in the day. The CAC-40 index closed at 3,069.30, up 45.67 points, or 1.51 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Stocks closed near the day's highs, drawing strength from a 3 percent jump in index heavyweight Novartis. The Swiss market index closed at 5,929.5, up 87.4 points, or 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended trade lower, discouraged by worries that more big brokerages could be involved in a payoff scandal ensnaring Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. The 225-stock Nikkei average closed at 20,212.82, down 189.92 points, or 0.93 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - The Hang Seng Index swept through 16,000 points for the first time and set a record closing high as property stocks returned to favour after spending most of the post-handover period in the doldrums. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,983.18, up 211.12 points, or 1.34 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Stocks faded to finish little changed after a cut in interest rates proved to be an anticlimax with the market widely anticipating the Reserve Bank's actions. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,735.0, up 3.1 points, or 0.11 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial stocks finished higher helped by Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals' comments that he was hopeful interest rates would be cut before year-end. The All-Stock index closed at 7,473.7, down 0.1 points, or 0.00 percent. The All-Gold index closed at 982.6, down 4.2 points, or 0.43 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 9,122.4, up 17.1 points, or 0.19 percent.</p>
