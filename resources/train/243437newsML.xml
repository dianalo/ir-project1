<p>Many state-owned firms in China have illegally declared bankruptcy, clearing their debts only to resume loss-making operations, the official People's Daily said on Monday.</p>
<p>Many firms had cleared their debts through bankruptcy but then continued to operate, losing more money and draining state assets, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It did not name any such companies and did not explain how they could stay in business, saying only they had declared bankruptcy as a way of shedding mountains of debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Bankrupt enterprises must really be bankrupt, workers must be relocated and enterprises must close down,&quot; the newspaper said of the use of the bankruptcy law.</p>
<p>China had to proceed slowly with bankruptcies, the newspaper said, adding that the closure of state-run factories would throw many people out of work before there was a social safety net in place to catch them.</p>
<p>&quot;For a long time to come, state-run industrial enterprises will be unable to declare bankruptcy based on debt-asset ratios and operational situations as in Western market economies,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The average debt-asset ratio of state-owned industrial enterprises was 80 percent, it said, adding that most of that debt was owed to state banks.</p>
<p>Vice-premier and economic tzar Zhu Rongji recently called on ailing state enterprises to avoid bankruptcies and seek mergers when they were in financial difficulty.</p>
<p>China passed a bankruptcy law in 1988 as the first part of an ambitious drive to force lumbering state-owned enterprises to sink or swim in the market place.</p>
<p>It has generally used bankruptcies only for smaller enterprises but the number of firms pushed out of business under the legal framework has been growing.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, 1,692 enterprises declared bankruptcy, more than double the figure for the year-ago period, official figures show.</p>
