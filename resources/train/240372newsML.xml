<p>Pakistan's fertiliser industry, expanding for the last 10 years, is expected to see more growth in revenue, profits and production, a recent research report by brokerage house James Capel Asia said.</p>
<p>&quot;At present the industry is poised to experience growth in revenue in the future, fuelled by an increasing demand for fertiliser and rising prices,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It said the industry had grown impressively in the last 10 years, with output rising to more than 2.2 million tonnes in fiscal 1992/93 (July-June) from 1.203 million tonnes in 1982/83 due to demand, tax exemptions and the import of new machinery.</p>
<p>Pakistan produced a provisional 4.1 million tonnes of fertiliser in 1995/96 and imported 1.1 million tonnes from Germany, the United States, Norway, South Korea, The Netherlands, Belgium and Finland.</p>
<p>The production increase was largely due to combined capacity additions of 1.1 million tonnes in 1993 by Fauji Fertiliser Co Ltd (FFC) and Engro Chemicals Ltd.</p>
<p>Production is expected to grow by another 1.8 million tonnes in 1998 when two more plants of FFC and Al-Noor Fertiliser are due to come on line and Engro plans to increase its capacity.</p>
<p>Pakistan has a total of 10 fertiliser factories of which six are state-run. But the four private-sector plants dominate the industry, accounting for 62 percent of total production.</p>
<p>The report said private sector dominance would increase in future as the government plans to privatise state-owned Pak Saudi Fertiliser and other units.</p>
<p>&quot;Given such a market structure, the level of competition is predictably low, which augurs well for the industry given the homogenous and quintessential nature of the product,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The report said the industry would maintain long-term profitability because of low competition, high barriers to new entrants and growing demand. &quot;However, together with this growth in demand is the constraint of limited supplies of the industry's most important input, natural gas,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Pakistan's gas reserves, estimated at 21 trillion cubic feet, are expected to last only 30 years.</p>
<p>&quot;With the absence of substantial new discoveries, the industry will have to rely on imported gas or alternate methods of production in the long-term.</p>
<p>&quot;Expensive imported gas can squeeze margins, unless the government subsidises it to maintain the cost of fertiliser production,&quot; the report said.</p>
