<p>The Academy Awards show, never a stranger to controversy, became a magnet on Monday for issues ranging from sex to Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>As limousines began to arrive at the Shrine Auditorium for the 69th Academy Awards, protesters were on the streets that were lined with fans hoping for a glimpse of the stars.</p>
<p>One group held anti-Disney placards over allegations about using child labour to make merchandise and another crowd of free speech proponents displayed signs hailing Larry Flynt, the controversial publisher of Hustler magazine.</p>
<p>Among their slogans were &quot;Hollywood Bent Over For Gloria, Censorship Is Free-Dumb,&quot; in reference to feminist Gloria Steinem, and &quot;Flynt Is Our Hero.&quot;</p>
<p>Several fundamentalist Christians held up placards denouncing Flynt, whose tumultuous life is the subject of &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt,&quot; which earned two Oscar nominations.</p>
<p>This group's posters read &quot;No Adultry. No Perverts.&quot;</p>
<p>Others slammed Hollywood in general with &quot;Movie Scum Repent -- Stop Promoting Sin.&quot;</p>
<p>Another Christian group chanted &quot;No to Larry Flynt&quot; from the bleachers when the publisher arrived at the event. Flynt's arrival was somewhat of a surprise after he had bitterly complained recently that he was snubbed by Columbia Pictures for not inviting him.</p>
<p>Before the ceremonies, one airplane circling the Shrine Auditorium pulled a banner with the legend &quot;Columbia Studios suck -- L. Flynt.&quot;</p>
<p>Flynt has been the subject of criticism by feminists, spearheaded by author Steinem who placed a full page notice in numerous trade papers.</p>
<p>Steinem claimed the film glorified the abuse of women while inaccurately painting Flynt as a crusader for free speech.</p>
<p>Flynt arrived in a stretch white limousine with a hand painted picture of a reclining nude emblazoned on the side. Wearing a sequined tuxedo, Flynt was escorted in a gold-plated wheelchair to the applause of his fans.</p>
<p>As the ceremonies began it did not take long for Flynt to get a mention. Joking about the special effects on the film &quot;Twister,&quot; host Billy Crystal said &quot;200 miles an hour, that's almost enough wind to blow Gloria Steinem to a screening of Larry Flynt.&quot;</p>
<p>When the crowd responded loudly, Crystal said &quot;that sounded a bit like a Disney shareholders meeting for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month Disney shareholders protested at the company's annual meeting claiming the entertainment giant used contractors that employed child labour sweatshops in Haiti to make clothing and other Disney merchandise.</p>
<p>Outside a plane pulled a banner that read &quot;Disney uses sweatshops -- 30 cents an hour in Haiti.&quot;</p>
<p>The ceremony was largely devoid of any political controversy although President Bill Clinton's fund-raising methods were the brunt of some jocularity. Crystal joked that Clinton had made a film called &quot;101 Donations.&quot;</p>
