<title>USA: Spine-Tech surges on earnings surprise.</title>
<headline>Spine-Tech surges on earnings surprise.</headline>

<p>Shares of Spine-Tech Inc jumped about 15 percent Wednesday after the company reported second quarter revenues and earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.</p>
<p>The company also said Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a laparoscopic procedure developed by the company for its BAK interbody spinal fusion system.</p>
<p>&quot;It was mostly the earnings surprise and a little bit the FDA,&quot; Thomas Gunderson, analyst at Piper Jaffray, said of the stock move Wednesday. Analysts said the FDA approval was expected, though the timing was not certain.  </p>
<p>The company reported revenues of $14.2 million and earnings of $0.25 a share for the quarter. Analysts said they had expected revenues closer to $12 million and that earnings estimates were between about $0.12 and $0.18 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;The primary reason for the jump in EPS was $2 million more in revenue, (with) operating expenses $1 million less than expected,&quot; said Wade King, senior research analyst at Robertson Stephens. King said he raised his fiscal 1997 earnings estimate to $0.90 from $0.60 a share. The company, which received initial FDA approval for its product in September, posted a loss in 1996.</p>
<p>Gunderson also raised his estimate, to a profit of $0.93 a share for 1997 from $0.67 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;What helps them is they had a faster ramp up of sales,&quot; he said. &quot;This is only their third quarter since FDA approval.</p>
<p>Spine-Tech shares were up 7-1/4 at 54-1/4 Wednesday.</p>
