<p>China has intensified its battle to stamp out theft of intellectual property rights since the beginning of last year but copyright infringement remained widespread, the China Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Between January 1996 and the end of May this year, China's courts handled 5,296 intellectual property rights cases, of which 4,735 were settled, it quoted Li Guoguang, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, as saying.</p>
<p>China vowed to clamp down on piracy after reaching an agreement in June 1996 with the United States that narrowly averted a multi-billion dollar cross-Pacific trade war over Chinese theft of intellectual property.</p>
<p>The number of cases in the first five months of this year was 15.3 percent higher compared with the year-ago period, LI said, but gave no figure.</p>
<p>The increase in lawsuits showed legal awareness had risen as more people resorted to the law to protect their legitimate rights, he said. However, the problem was still serious, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, quite a small number of businesses are still illegally exploiting other people's labour for their own profit,&quot; Li said.</p>
<p>A variety of unexpected cases had appeared, he said, ranging from stealing geological prospecting results to theft of computer software rights.</p>
<p>China's Supreme People's Court on Wednesday announced several major convictions in intellectual property rights cases, the China Daily said.</p>
<p>One case involved two Beijing companies that had pirated laser discs of 19 American films, it said.</p>
<p>In November 1996, a court ruled that Beijing Xianke Laser Market and Audiovisual World of the Beijing Culture and Art Press had infringed copyrights of eight U.S. firms, including Walt Disney Co and News Corp Ltd's 20th Century Fox, it said.</p>
<p>The court had confiscated the pirated laser discs and ordered the companies to pay compensation of 290,000 yuan ($34,940), it said.</p>
<p>In another case, Nanjing Baogao Industry Co Ltd International paid $20,000 to Switzerland's Interlego AG and the Danish company Lego Overseas A/S for illegally using their registered trademark and designs, it said.</p>
