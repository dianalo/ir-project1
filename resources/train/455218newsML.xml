<p>3Com Corp said on Thursday that sales of systems products, including switches, hubs, internetworking and remote access products, rose 24 percent in the third quarter ending February 28 to $432.6 million.</p>
<p>In a statement accompanying 3Com's financial results, the data networking company said sales of network adapters increased 39 percent from the third quarter a year ago, to $346.3 million.  </p>
<p>For the quarter ended February 28, 3Com said net income rose to $87.6 million or $0.47 a share from $74.6 million or $0.42 a share in the year-ago period. Sales rose 30 percent to $786.8 million. The results were slightly above the First Call estimate of $0.46 a share.</p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Benhamou said, &quot;During the quarter we saw strong demand for our high-end networking solutions, particularly ATM systems, and the number of multi-million dollar orders we received from large accounts has never been greater.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, our industry is in the midst of many important transitions,&quot; Benhamou added, citing the adoption of higher-speed technologies, new paradigms for switching and routing network traffic, and more volume-based pricing and distribution.</p>
<p>He said that as a result of these changes, 3Com's results in the latest quarter reflected &quot;increased price competition and a pause in industry demand as enterprise networking customers and network service providers assess how best to maximize their networking investments.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that the changes were &quot;positive for 3Com and the industry in the long run.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month, 3Com announced a definitive agreement to merge with U.S. Robotics Corp, forming a combined company with annual revenues in excess of $5 billion.</p>
<p>Under terms of the agreement, each share of U.S. Robotics stock will be exchanged for 1.75 shares of 3Com stock. 3Com reiterated the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, and is expected to be neutral to slightly accretive to 3Com earnings in fiscal 1998.</p>
