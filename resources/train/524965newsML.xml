<title>USA: Texas opposes immunity in tobacco settlement.</title>
<headline>Texas opposes immunity in tobacco settlement.</headline>
<dateline>AUSTIN, Texas 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>Texas Attorney General Dan Morales said on Monday he would oppose any settlement with tobacco companies that would give them immunity from future legal action.</p>
<p>He said in a letter to members of the Texas Legislature the tobacco industry did not deserve immunity because it &quot;has reneged on every promise it has ever made to the American people.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is any industry undeserving of immunity from future liability, it is the tobacco industry,&quot; Morales wrote.  </p>
<p>Cigarrette makers and anti-tobacco leaders have been in talks recently to reach a settlement that would resolve a multitude of anti-tobacco lawsuits in the United States.</p>
<p>News reports have said the tobacco industry might pay up to $300 billion over 25 years to compensate smokers with tobacco-related ills in exchange for broad protection from legal action.</p>
<p>Morales filed a lawsuit in March 1996 year on behalf of the state of Texas seeking $4 billion in damages from tobacco companies to recoup Medicaid costs of smokers.  Similar suits have been filed in 23 states.</p>
<p>The Texas case is scheduled for trial in September in federal court in Texarkana, Texas.</p>
<p>Morales said in his letter that he was &quot;very encouraged&quot; by the recent talks but said &quot;Texas will not be a party to any settlement&quot; that includes tobacco industry legal immunity.</p>
<p>&quot;Under our system of justice, one may not buy the right to violate the law.  This basic principle of accountability must not be compromised -- at any price,&quot; Morales said.</p>
