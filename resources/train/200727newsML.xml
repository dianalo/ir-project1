<p>Ozone-depleting gas emissions from Saudi Arabia will be tamed by hard-nosed economics rather than environmentalists' scientific arguments or treaties on global warming, Gulf energy analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is outdone only by Nigeria as the planet's main culprit for flaring or simply venting gas, produced as a result of the continuous exploitation of its unrivalled oilfields which provide much of the industrialised world's petroleum needs.</p>
<p>Environmentalists have drawn a direct link between the carbon dioxide and methane released by the burning of fossil fuels and global warming.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia condemned in July a declaration backed by key world powers and written into the official record at a United Nations Conference on Climate Change that pledged to fight global warming by aiming to reduce gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Paris-based International Energy Agency, the West's energy watchdog, estimates that more 10 percent -- or an annual 25 billion cubic metres -- of all gas flared, vented and lost in the global production process comes from Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>But the sight and sulphurous smell of gas flares in the leading oil producing state could be less frequent as Saudi planners expand the domestic gas processing and distribution system to keep pace with surging local gas-fired power demand.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of this expansion programme, there will be a significant reduction in gas flaring in the kingdom, currently at 10.4 billion cubic metres a year,&quot; Anwar Yusuf Abdullah, director of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Riyadh-based energy secretariat told a gas conference in Qatar earlier this week.</p>
<p>State-owned oil firm Saudi Aramco is investing $2.5 billion within the next six years to increase capacity at the country's Master Gas System (MGS) by expanding existing plants and building a new facility at the giant Ghawar oilfield.</p>
<p>Electricity consumption in the current Saudi five-year plan (1995-2000) predicts annual average growth of 6.4 percent, most of which will be met by increased gas use at power stations.</p>
<p>The MGS ran up to capacity constraints as a result of Saudi Arabia's decision to hike oil output to avoid a potentially harmful shortfall in world crude exports after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>Higher oil output resulted in surplus associated gas flows which could not be handled by MGS. This alone caused a trebling in gas flaring, according to figures published by the Vienna-based secretariat of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas flaring has to come down and it will when the country's gas system is expanded to meet the pressing local need,&quot; said one Western energy executive based in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The escape each year of 25 billion cubic metres of gas from Saudi Arabia is the equivalent of the entire gas production of Argentina and comes close to North Sea oil powerhouse Norway which sells 35 billion cubic metres of gas.</p>
<p>Just flaring in Saudi Arabia is double the average amount of gas flared in the other GCC oil states of Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, Abdullah's figures show.</p>
<p>The precise impact of this on ozone levels is hotly argued.</p>
<p>The GCC has said that it is not proven that human activity causes warming and argues emission cuts involving a reduction in fossil fuel use would cause economic hardships.</p>
