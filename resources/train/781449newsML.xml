<p>Croatian interbank rates remained stable on Wednesday despite less kuna demand, money market dealers said.</p>
<p>Fresh trade shrank to 22.5 million kuna ($3.4 million), compared to more than 80 million before Monday's 3.4 billion reserve payment. Supply was still high at around 70 million kuna.</p>
<p>Call money loans, accounting for most of the morning's money market trade, were struck at a steady 7.0 percent.</p>
<p>The one-month interbank rate was also steady at 11 percent, with 13 percent charged to a savings bank.</p>
<p>One bank still agreed to pay a higher 18-percent rate for a three-month loan.</p>
<p>&quot;These are considered to be highly liquid funds, so the price is higher,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Daily liquidity in the banking system, usually more strained during the summer due to exchange operations, has eased since the central bank bought some 450 million kuna of hard currency from commercial banks last week.</p>
<p>No banks had any shortfalls, with a solid 628.6 million kuna on their balances on Monday. They had only 0.75 milion kuna in outstanding Lombard loans from the central bank.</p>
<p>Tuesday was a bank holiday in Croatia. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb newsroom +385 1 455 7075 ($ = 6.675 Croatian Kuna)</p>
