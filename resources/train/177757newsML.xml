<title>UK: Med oil products broadly stronger.</title>
<headline>Med oil products broadly stronger.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mediterranean oil products were steady to firmer on Friday.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices were steady with cargoes at $216/$218 cif and traders waiting for results from the Egyptian tender that closed this week for further direction.</p>
<p>Stronger crude continued to underpin prices but the Med was seen well balanced with most end user demand seen satisfied and cargoes heading north were believed to have homes.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices also edged up with a rebound in crude and a correction to Thursday's selloff, but the market was well balanced and not as volatile as northwest Europe, traders said.</p>
<p>Higher sulphur gas oil grades were slightly firmer in line with the NWE market and benchmark futures, with supply tightening after a Turkish tender, due to be awarded tonight, soaked up 100,000 tonnes of second half November product. Good demand was also seen elsewhere in the eastern Med.</p>
<p>But EU grade diesel looked under pressure with ample local supply, particularly from Algeria.</p>
<p>The arbitrage to Asia was now unworkable, traders said, after two cargoes recently headed out of the region to India.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked fuel oil rose, broadly on the back of stronger paper that saw a Dec trade concluded at $125 fob NWE.</p>
<p>A low sulphur cargo out of Port Jerome, sold yesterday at $121.50 fob NWE, changed hands on Friday at cif high quotes +3.00 basis two Italian ports. Traders said sellers were unlikely to accept below about $130 cif.</p>
<p>High sulphur cracked was steady around $107 fob Med with good demand offset by a Syrian 50kt cargo looking increasingly distressed. Dealers said there was talk of bringing in NWE cargoes to meet demand, but nothing was seen concluded. An M-100 was sold at cif high +$3 cif Falconnara.</p>
