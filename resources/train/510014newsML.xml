<p>Public Service Enterprise Group Inc has decided to continue to be an active player in every part of the electric utility business, chief executive E. James Ferland told shareholders Tuesday.</p>
<p>For companies who know their strengths, &quot;competition won't be disabling or frightening; it will be challenging and profitable,&quot; he told the annual meeting, stating Enterprise is making broad, innovative plans to control its own future.</p>
<p>&quot;As rulemakers are making decisions about the restructuring of this industry, we are making some important decisions of our own,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>One of the most fundamental decisions the company has made, he said, is the decision to continue to be an active, strong player in every part of the electric industry business -- from generation, to transmission, distribution, metering and billing.</p>
<p>&quot;While other companies may be staking out positions in one area of the business or may be unclear as to their direction, we know we have the ability to compete across the board.  And we intend to,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>As one of the largest employers in the state with 11,000 employees, &quot;another of our core strengths is that we know New Jersey, its people and its neighborhoods better than any competitor who will come to New Jersey as a 'store front' operation.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that at least one potential competitor has already voiced opposition to providing a presence in New Jersey and being required to have even a store front address.  Ferland cited the three factors which he feels best position Enterprise to compete:</p>
<p>-- &quot;We know how we want to position ourselves in this new marketplace;</p>
<p>-- we know how much we value new ideas and good people; and</p>
<p>-- we know how and where we can invest our dollars to manage and control our own future.&quot;</p>
