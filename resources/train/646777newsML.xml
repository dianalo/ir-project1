<headline>Chilean board approves Endesa dam project.</headline>

<p>The National Environmental Commission (Conama) approved electrical utility Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA's (Endesa) plans to build a second, 570-megawatt dam on the Bio Bio river in southern Chile.</p>
<p>Conama said it approved the Ralco dam project on the condition that Endesa complete plans to relocate several hundred Pehuenche Indians in the area, create a 3,800 hectares biological reserve and accept independent auditing of the project.</p>
<p>The Ralco project would be Endesa's second hydroelectric dam on the Bio Bio, Chile's longest river, after it opened its Pangue dam downstream in March last year.  </p>
<p>&quot;The executive board of Conama has approved the Ralco Hydroelectric Station project,&quot; said the board in a statement.</p>
<p>Conama is Chile's equivalent of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Its approval of Endesa's environmental impact study on Ralco, attacked by environmentalists and indigenous rights groups, was needed for the project to go ahead.</p>
<p>Basic engineering work has already begun on Ralco, which will span a wooded valley at the foot of the Andes.  </p>
<p>Endesa first submitted its environmental report to Conama last year but the board said it needed more information on the fate of the Pehuenches and other issues before it could decide whether to grant a license for the project.</p>
<p>Both Ralco and the 450 MW Pangue dam have been fought by Chilean and U.S. environmentalists, who point out that the projects have flooded rare temperate rain forest and will drive Pehuenche Indian families off their ancestral lands.</p>
<p>Controversy over the project affected its financing early this year.  </p>
<p>Endesa in March paid back loans totalling $150 million from the World Bank's financial wing, the International Finance Corp (IFC), after the bank alleged Endesa was failing to live up to its environmental commitments in the dam projects.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to Chile's Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat, World Bank president James Wolfensohn threatened in February to declare Endesa in default of its commitments under the loans' terms.</p>
<p>Endesa prepaid the loans using a new five-year credit from the Dresdner Bank with an interest rate of Libor plus 0.25 percent, which is lower than the rate for the IFC loan.</p>
<p>A U.S. green group, Friends of the Earth, charged the World Bank last week with trying to suppress an independent critical report on the project.</p>
