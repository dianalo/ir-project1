<p>Fighting broke out near Burundi's capital on Thursday after an overnight lull and doctors said Hutu rebels had killed three soldiers in attacks near Bujumbura on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent on the eastern outskirts of the city reported hearing mortar explosions and automatic weapons fire from the hills where the army and rebels fought on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Doctors at Kamenge military hospital in Bujumbura said the soldiers were killed and one was wounded on Wednesday in what rebels said was a show of strength against the sanctions-hit capital.</p>
<p>An army spokesman said fighting stopped on Wednesday evening and reported no overnight clashes after the Tutsi-dominated military threatened to &quot;neutralise&quot; any assault on the city.</p>
<p>&quot;They will never be allowed to attack the capital,&quot; army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani told Reuters.</p>
<p>Civil war and massacres have killed more than 150,000 people in the last three years, provoking fears of a bloodbath like the one in neighbouring Rwanda, where up to a million people are estimated to have died in genocide and civil war in 1994.</p>
<p>The army on Wednesday used two helicopters mounted with machineguns and a single-engine plane to strafe and rocket an area a few kilometres (miles) east of the city, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Forces for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) fired mortar bombs at Bujumbura on Tuesday in the first attack on the capital since the army ousted Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya on July 25.</p>
<p>African leaders responded by clamping sanctions on Burundi on July 31, demanding Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya agree to talks with Hutu rebels and a return to constitutional rule.</p>
<p>Buyoya says the rebels must first lay down their arms.</p>
<p>Residents of northern Mutanga, the suburb closest to the hills where Wednesday's clashes with rebels took place, spent the evening anxiously waiting for a second night of violence.</p>
<p>The United States on Wednesday flew out 31 Americans and other foreigners from Bujumbura on a C-141 Starlifter.</p>
<p>The plane was grounded for nearly seven hours when Tanzania refused to give it permission to overfly its airspace on the grounds that this would be sanctions busting, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The U.S. aircraft eventually received permission to fly over Rwanda and Uganda and reached the Kenyan capital Nairobi.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme said it was looking after 16,000 people, mainly Tutsis, displaced by five days of fighting in the northern province of Kayanza which borders on southern Rwanda.</p>
<p>One soldier and 10 Tutsi civilians were killed during a rebel attack at Gahombo in Kayanza on Tuesday, the army added.</p>
<p>Members of Burundi's mainstream Hutu Frodebu party said on Wednesday they were were backing the FDD and its political wing, the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), called on party leader Jean Minani to announce their new alliance.</p>
<p>Julius Nyerere, the international mediator on Burundi, said a CNDD-Frodebu alliance might &quot;clarify&quot; the Hutu leadership.</p>
<p>Nyerere, a former Tanzanian president, has tried in vain to push all sides in Burundi's conflict to talks.</p>
