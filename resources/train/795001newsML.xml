<p>More people in Beijing have shown an interest in investing in stocks after exchanges recently cut the deposit requirement to open an account, the Financial News said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Stock trading accounts opened by residents in China's capital were expected to reach 1.1 million by the end of this year, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>About 2,064 accounts were opened by individuals every day from August 4 to 8, up 78.0 percent compared with the daily average in July, it said.</p>
<p>Many stock trading centres in Beijing opened telephone trading and sharply cut deposits this month to attract more investors, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>In some centres, investors need to pay only 200 yuan ($25) in commission to open a telephone trading account. Previously the deposit to open an account was at least 50,000 yuan, it said.</p>
<p>More individual businessmen and laid-off workers were among those opening accounts, it added.</p>
<p>It gave no further details.</p>
