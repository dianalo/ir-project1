<p>The peace deal which saved the Five Nations rugby union championship has assured the tournament for the next 10 years at least, it was announced on Monday.</p>
<p>The Five Nations Committee, meeting in Dublin, have rubber-stamped last Thursday's announcement that England had come to an agreement with the other unions in a long-running dispute over television revenue.</p>
<p>Any union wishing to withdraw from the tournament must now give five years notice, starting no earlier than end-June 2002. The accord recognises the binding contract the Rugby Football Union signed with satellite broadcasters BSkyB.</p>
<p>But the committee have insisted there will be a fair balance between matches shown on terrestrial channels and those on cable or satellite.</p>
<p>They have also restated the principle of joint negotiations in future on all tournament issues, with a unanimous vote required on matters relating to format or financial changes.</p>
<p>Ninety per cent of revenue raised from broadcast rights will now be split equally, with five per cent awarded according to each country's results in the tournament and five per cent according to the number of clubs affiliated to each union.</p>
<p>The president of the French Rugby Federation (FFR) has also signed the accord and will be returning with it to Paris for formal ratification. Tom Kiernan, Five Nations committee chairman, said: &quot;We feel the game is now well placed to grow and prosper into the new millennium.&quot;</p>
