<p>Washington's new envoy to Vietnam underlined his commitment to the missing-in-action issue on Tuesday, attending a routine repatriation ceremony for remains of American servicemen just 11 days after his arrival.</p>
<p>Douglas &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson, himself a fighter pilot and prisoner of war in the conflict that ended 22 years ago, stood to attention with military personnel as American flags were draped over seven, body-length aluminium caskets at Hanoi airport.</p>
<p>Nguyen Xuan Phong, director of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's America Department, stood at a polite distance on the tarmac as the hour-long ceremony played out.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always cooperated sincerely with the effort and we will continue to do so until the last American family requires us to do so,&quot; Phong told reporters as the caskets were carried ceremoniously through the tailgate of a U.S. Air Force plane.</p>
<p>Peterson proclaimed a &quot;new era&quot; of constructive relations between the two former enemies when he arrived on May 9.</p>
<p>But he stressed that the fullest possible accounting of the 2,124 American servicemen and civilians still listed as missing in Indochina would remain Washington's priority in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Communist Vietnam has cooperated with the United States in the exhaustive hunt for remains, especially since the two countries normalised relations in 1995.</p>
<p>However, Hanoi occasionally expresses frustration over Washington's emphasis on the MIA issue.</p>
<p>Reiterating a comment made by the foreign ministry when former National Security Adviser Anthony Lake visited Vietnam last year, Phong said Washington could do more to make up for the past.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to see a greater effort by the American side to solve the consequences of the war in Vietnam,&quot; Phong said. &quot;The effort made by the American side is very modest so far in comparison with its great material potential.&quot;</p>
<p>Vietnamese officials say Hanoi wants to see the United States join other Western nations at an annual aid pledging session and some talk of reviving the question of war reparations.</p>
<p>More than three million Vietnamese people lost their lives in the conflict, countless others were maimed and huge tracts of the country's land were wrecked by U.S. spraying of defoliants.</p>
<p>An estimated 58,000 Americans died in the war.</p>
<p>Asked about reparations, Phong said: &quot;I think the Americans...need to know the nature of the war here, the consequences left by the war here and then they will feel more and more of a moral obligation to do something here.&quot;</p>
<p>The thaw in relations between the two countries has been slow since normalisation. Mutual suspicion remains and a trade agreement -- which would lead to most-favoured nation (MFN) status for Vietnam -- still eludes them.</p>
<p>Peterson, who spent 6-1/2 years in the euphemistically named &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; prison during the war, has kept a low profile since taking up his post on May 9.</p>
<p>After watching small boxes of bone fragments being sealed, placed in the metal caskets and then loaded onto the plane, he chatted with the aircrew, shook hands with Phong and drove off, ignoring reporters' shouted questions.</p>
