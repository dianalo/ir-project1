<p>Shares in Telspec Plc leapt on Thursday as the telecommunications equipment group reported a heavy loss of 1996 but said it expected to return to profitability in the current year.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line figures were if anything slightly worse than expected,&quot; said one market-maker in the stock, &quot;but there was a reasonable statement talking about recovery which was encouraging.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock, which plummeted last September after the company issued a second profit warning of the year, was up 27-1/2p at 225 by 1229 GMT on volume of 247,065 shares.</p>
<p>Telspec said it fell to a pre-tax loss of 9.9 million stg in 1996 from a profit of 8.7 million a year before, but chairman Frank Hackett-Jones said &quot;decisive action&quot; had been taken and worldwide demand remained strong.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the performance improvement established in the second half (of 1996) to continue throughout 1997,&quot; Hackett-Jones said.</p>
<p>Listed in December 1993, Telspec shares set a record 10.50 stg in November 1995, before tumbling last May as the group warned that first-half profits would be hit by a number of temporary factors, with some high-margin sales deferred to the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Then last September it said the difficulties had been &quot;significantly worse&quot; than it had first expected and the shares hit a low of 130p at the end of 1996.</p>
