<p>U.S. regulators said on Thursday they were seeking an order to require Automatic Data Processing Inc to divest enough assets to restore competition in the salvage information management industry.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission said ADP's acquisition of AutoInfo Inc in 1995 had created a monopoly that had raised prices and reduced the quality of service in the car salvage yard information management industry,  </p>
<p>ADP, Roseland, N.J., which had $3 billion in revenues in 1995, provides information services and develops and sells computerized information systems to a variety of industries, including auto salvage yards and insurance companies.</p>
<p>The FTC said ADP acquired AutoInfo in April 1995, but later paid a $2.97 million civil penalty to resolve federal charges that its statutorily-required filing for pre-merger antitrust review was deficient, omitting for example documents that showed among other things that:</p>
<p>- there was an anticompetitive intent underlying the proposed acquisition;</p>
<p>- that the proposed acquisition would create serious compeititive concerns;</p>
<p>- and that ADP believed the acquisition would give it a monopoly or virtual monopoly in several product markets.</p>
<p>The FTC said it alleged in its administrative complaint that &quot;the acquisition was part of an ADP plan to acquire the leading information service providers to the salvage industry and thereby acquire monopoly power.&quot;</p>
<p>Included in ADP's plan was the acquisition of Hollander Inc., completed in 1992, and of AutoInfo, the agency said.</p>
<p>It said an administrative hearing would be scheduled soon.</p>
