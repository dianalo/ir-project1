<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan will likely take action to implement some of the army's demands to curb religious activism when he chairs a cabinet meeting on Thursday, a cabinet minister said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The measures will be discussed&quot; at the cabinet session on Thursday, Tourism Minister Bahattin Yucel, from the pro-Western junior coalition partner True Path Party, said.</p>
<p>The cabinet would go some way to carrying out anti-Islamist measures demanded by the secularist army, Yucel told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some that have to be sent to parliament and some that have to be dealt with by decree. The necessary procedures will be carried out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Erbakan, the first Islamist to lead modern Turkey, has approved on paper a crackdown against recent Islamist zeal which the generals fear undermines official secularism and democracy.</p>
<p>But the prime minister has so far taken no concrete action against what is in effect his own core constituency.</p>
<p>The army has staged three coups since 1960.</p>
<p>Erbakan said on Tuesday night the cabinet meeting would &quot;show all due care and attention&quot; to a military order for a revival of the rigid secularism of the 1920s, when republican Turkey rose from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Political analysts say Erbakan will probably give concessions at Thursday's meeting on demands he sees as not directly affecting his grassroots support.</p>
<p>He can bring illegal Koranic instruction under official control and license tens of thousands of shotguns that the army fears may be used by religious militants without upsetting his Islamist voters, commentators say.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the cabinet is trying to win time. For example they can agree on the shotguns,&quot; said Sedat Ergin of the Hurriyet daily.</p>
<p>Coalition partner Tansu Ciller, a U.S.-educated conservative who heads the foreign ministry, said in a speech to her True Path MPs on Tuesday: &quot;There is no going back from the secular republic.&quot;</p>
<p>The generals want the coalition to legislate against peaceful Islamist dissent and restrict the number of religious secondary schools where many of Erbakan's Welfare Party supporters were educated.</p>
<p>Ergin said the army was particularly keen on seeing the government clamp down on religious teaching. &quot;If the articles about education do not get passed it could deepen the crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>The army's latest involvement in politics has strained the unity of the coalition, formed last June after months of bargaining. Welfare won a narrow victory with 21 percent of the vote at general elections in 1995.</p>
<p>Anatolian news agency quoted a leading Islamist as saying fresh polls were possible if Erbakan sorted out Turkey's economic woes.</p>
<p>&quot;We know the effect of elections on an economy and we believe it is our mission to correct the economic balances. If we put the economic balances on the right track we can go to early elections,&quot; the agency quoted Welfare Party deputy chairman Oguzhan Asilturk as saying.</p>
<p>Annual inflation stands at around 80 percent and the political turmoil has upset the government's ambitious plans to balance the budget.</p>
<p>The Istanbul stock market lost 10.5 percent of its value last week on political worries. Shares closed down 2.31 percent on Wednesday in cautious trading ahead of the cabinet meeting.</p>
