<title>UK: SOCCER-ZOLA SENDS SOUTHAMPTON BOTTOM.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-ZOLA SENDS SOUTHAMPTON BOTTOM.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gianfranco Zola continued his rich vein of form on Wednesday when his goal gave Chelsea a 1-0 victory over struggling Southampton and moved the London club to fifth place in the English premier league.</p>
<p>At the other end of the table Middlesbrough beat Blackburn 2-1 at home to move off the bottom and above Southampton.</p>
<p>The night's other game saw Leicester draw 1-1 at home with Tottenham.</p>
<p>Zola can do no wrong at the moment and it was again his fruitful partnership with Mark Hughes that earned Chelsea the points at Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>Hughes seized on a long clearance by keeper Frode Grodas and laid the ball back for Zola to crash in a shot from 20 metres.</p>
<p>It was his 11th goal of the season and kept Ruud Gullit's side very much in the hunt for a UEFA Cup berth next season.</p>
<p>Southampton manager Graeme Souness dropped Matt Le Tissier for the game but is running out of time and options if he is to keep the south coast side in the top flight.</p>
<p>Juninho put Middlesbrough ahead a minute before half time and Italian Fabrizio Ravanelli made it 2-0 after an hour with his 26th of the season.</p>
<p>Chris Sutton pulled one back for Blackburn but Bryan Robson's side held out for their third successive league win.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough's appeal against a three-point deduction for failing to fulfil a fixture is heard next week.</p>
<p>Steve Claridge scored for Leicester after 70 minutes, missed a sitter soon after and paid the price when Teddy Sheringham equalised for Spurs in the last minute.</p>
