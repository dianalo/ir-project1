<p>The Algerian government said on Wednesday the monthly allowance for poor people would be increased by 50 percent to 900 dinars ($16.6) from 600 dinars, the official Algerian news agency APS said.</p>
<p>The increase will take effect on October 1.</p>
<p>The government also raised by 33.3 percent to 2,800 dinars ($51.8) from 2,100 dinars salaries for people in temporary work paid by the government under a safety net, it added. This will also become effective on October 1.</p>
<p>Inflation is estimated to be running at an annual 20 percent.</p>
<p>The Algerian authorities set up a social scheme to help ease hardship for some four million people, mainly elderly and unemployed youngsters, as they try to shift the once central commanded economy towards a free market.</p>
<p>Algeria's workforce is estimated at some four million, out of the population of 29 million -- more than 60 percent of whom are aged under 30. An estimated 2.1 million people are jobless.</p>
<p>The North African country's economy has also been hit in the past five years by violence blamed on Moslem fundamentalists, whom the government also blames for sabotage estimated to have cost the economy more than $2 billion. Officials say that poverty, particularly among the young, provides a fertile breeding ground for the fundamentalist ranks.</p>
