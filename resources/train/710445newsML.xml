<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices fell in late trading on Monday on the back of poor demand, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is crumbling. Prices are falling and buying interest is just zero. It seems that we have no choice but to cut the offer price,&quot; said one trader in Palembang, South Sumatra.</p>
<p>Traders in other centres reported similar bearish sentiment, with no bids or deals were heard in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One trader in Bangka island off South Sumatra said he did was holding off sales because of tight supply and also due to the current pepper harvest.</p>
<p>&quot;People's attention is on pepper, whose price is much higher compared with rubber,&quot; one trader in Bangka said.</p>
<p>&quot;When pepper is still hot, it's better for us to wait a bit. In addition, supply (rubber) is very tight here at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said offer prices were quoted at 42.50 U.S. cents/lb fob Palembang for September shipment, 43.00 fob Medan, 42.25 fob Padang and Surabaya and 41.00 fob Pontianak and Jambi.</p>
<p>Traders said supply of raw material had started to improve at a number of centres, raising the possibility of further declines in offer prices.</p>
