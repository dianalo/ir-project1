<headline>LIFFE cocoa reverses at close on mixed selling.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>London cocoa futures retreated to negative after a firm start on Thursday following a mixture of selling from origins and disappointed longs.</p>
<p>Traders said sterling appeared to be the main culprit behind the market's weakness as it put the brakes on a recovery since Wednesday after the benchmark March position slipped to a contract low of 951 stg on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling psychologically gave an excuse to sell,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The currency has been buoyed by a UK interest rate hike of a quarter point on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LIFFE cocoa saw good buying at the start of the session which some traders associated with industrial offtake.</p>
<p>But the rally halted at 968 stg a tonne on March and prices reversed back.</p>
<p>Nigeria was an active origin alongside Ivory Coast which is said to be injecting a daily volume of cocoa into forward positions. Traders also cited arbitrage selling after the opening of the New York market.</p>
<p>At the close, March shed eight stg to 956 stg a tonne and spot December was off seven stg at 924 stg. Turnover totalled 9,194 lots but consisted mainly of crosses.</p>
<p>Technical support on March was pegged at 942 stg.</p>
<p>Traders said the market structure was widening with December losing its flavour on concerns that one leading trading house holding large amounts of cocoa could offload its position anytime.</p>
<p>Dec/March traded from 30 to 32 stg on Thursday while May/May was at 65.</p>
<p>Most European markets will be closed on Friday for All Saints Day.</p>
