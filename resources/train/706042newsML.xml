<p>COFFEE: World market for July 2, 1997</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London finished higher on roaster buying. July closed $13 higher at $1,804 per tonne. September gained $19 to close at $1,840 per tonne. Fears of cold weather in Brazil's coffee belt that had fuelled the New York rally on July 1 seems to have subsided.</p>
<p>Arabica futures in New York posted moderate losses, pressured by an absence of damaging cold in Brazil and signs of a build-up in US stockpiles. However, the market was able to find support at the lows. July ended 50 points lower at 196.00 cents/lb while September gave up 2.90 cents/lb to close at 172.35 cents/lb. The outer months lost between 0.25 to 1.85 cents/lb. Many analysts believe that prices will move up again given renewed concern about tight supplies during the transition period between the two crop years. It is believed that exports will come down before the start of the next harvest and that this will force roasters to reduce stocks once again.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>IVORY COAST - Coffee production in 1997/98 (October/September) is forecast to fall sharply below the 1996/97 figure of 5.0 million bags, the largest since the 6.2 million bags harvested in 1980/81, industry sources said. Ivory Coast had forecast a 1996/97 crop of 3.8 million 60-kg bags against 3.0 million bags the previous year but port arrivals have reached almost 5 million bags. Analysts said the 1996/97 crop was a one- off, helped by favourable weather during peak February-March 1996 flowering. In the longer term, harvests could swell as Ivory Coast attempts to fix annual production at 5 million bags by incentives to farmers, rehabilitation of plantations and replanting. Few steps have been taken so far, although high farmgate prices in 1995/96 have encouraged farmers to improve husbandry.</p>
<p>BRAZIL - According to a Reuters report, Swiss traders expect 1997/98 Brazilian production to reach 27.5 to 28 million 60-kg bags, down from a revised 30-31 million bags produced in 1996/97. The United States Department of Agriculture recently put 1997/98 production at 28 million bags, up from 27.5 million bags in 1996/97. Traders said the fact that the USDA left the 1996/97 estimate of 27.50 million bags unchanged came as a surprise to many crop watchers.</p>
<p>BELGIUM - Belgium imported 734,300 bags of coffee in January 1997, 56 per cent more than was imported the same month the previous year. Total imports in calendar year 1996 rose by 15 per cent to 2.375 million bags.</p>
<p>Exports in January 1997 reached 91,300 bags, 27 per cent less than was exported the same month the previous year. Total exports in calendar year 1996 rose by nearly 30 per cent to 1.561 million bags.</p>
