<p>Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle laid down conditions Thursday for Democratic backing of a Senate probe of campaign funds abuses including expanding it to look into congressional contributions.</p>
<p>The South Dakota Democrat told reporters he had informed Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississipi Republican, that Democrats want to look into congressional campaigns involving Republicans and not just alleged improprieties involving the White House and Democrats. His conditions also include limiting the time of the probe and getting Republican promises to consider legislation to reform campaign laws.</p>
<p>&quot;The scope has to include Congress,&quot; said Daschle, who also demanded campaign reform. &quot;And we will not agree to funding, to a date, to anything, until we get campaign finance reform.&quot;</p>
<p>Daschle's terms involve less money to finance the investigation than the $6.5 million sought by Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican whose panel is investigating funds abuses.</p>
<p>Thompson's efforts so far to get the Senate Rules Committee to approve the $6.5 million have been stalled by opposition from Democrats and by some Republicans who do not want his probe to include Congress.</p>
<p>Democrats say they want the initial funding for the probe to be $1.8 million, but Daschle said Thursday the party is &quot;flexible&quot; on that amount.</p>
<p>Senate sources said Lott may go around the Rules committee and take the measure for funding the probe directly to the Senate floor where Democrats may try to block the legislation if they do not get terms they like. Republicans have a 55-45 majority but need 60 votes to stop extensive debate over legislation to bring it to a vote.</p>
<p>Efforts by several senators to reform campaign spending laws have been greeted with little enthusiasm since current laws help incumbents raise more money than challengers.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not agree to anything,&quot; Daschle said, &quot;until we get campaign finance reform.</p>
