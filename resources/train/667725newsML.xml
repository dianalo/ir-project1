<p>The Indian rupee moved in a tight groove on Tuesday to end steady at 35.81/82, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was quite dull. Nothing much happened today,&quot; said a dealer. The rupee moved by one paisa from 35.81 to 35.82.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bought dollars at 35.82 in the afternoon from a handful of Bombay banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a clear signal that the RBI wants to hold the 35.80 level,&quot; said the chief dealer at a state-run bank.</p>
<p>&quot;RBI has been coming again and again at this level.&quot;</p>
<p>A foreign bank bought December dollars in the morning, exerting mild pressure on forward premiums, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six-month annualised forward premium closed at 4.30 percent compared with the previous close of 4.25 percent.</p>
<p>The rupee appreciated by 2.7 percent as per the real effective exchange rate (REER) index in February 1997, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Monday.</p>
<p>The rupee's REER in trade-based weights rose to 64.86 in February 1997 from 63.18 in January 1997, the Reserve Bank of India bulletin for June 1997 said.</p>
<p>&quot;This appreciation is for the month of February alone,&quot; said an economist at a securities firm in Bombay.</p>
<p>The rupee nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) also rose during the period, the RBI document said.</p>
<p>The NEER rose by 2.1 percent to 39.22 in February from 38.41 in January 1997, RBI said.</p>
<p>The official Tarapore Committee which earlier this month submitted its recommendations to make the rupee convertible on the capital account said the RBI should intervene if the REER crossed the five percent band.</p>
<p>The committee laid a road map to make the rupee convertible on the capital account in three years.</p>
<p>The rupee has held firm against the dollar over the last year despite the dollar's rise against major global currencies.</p>
