<p>Aslan Maskhadov looks like an unlikely candidate to lead a rag-tag band of guerrillas to victory over the Russian army and then be elected president.</p>
<p>But the man with an avuncular bearing and modest manner swept to victory in Monday's presidential election in the breakaway region of Chechnya and is determined the devastated region should be recognised as a state.</p>
<p>The Chechen people are known for their fiery pride and love of weapons and their region is one where personal disputes can turn into decades-long blood feuds between rival clans.</p>
<p>Yet Maskhadov, 45, was the front-runner to capture the presidency of Chechnya, which has declared independence from Russia but has not been recognised by any foreign country.</p>
<p>He was chief commander of Chechnya's resistance army during the 21-month war with Russian troops who swept into the tiny region in late 1994 to try to crush its independence bid.</p>
<p>Early in the war, Chechens grew used to his nightly briefings on local televison broadcasts from the ground floor of the presidential palace, the centre of rebel resistance in which he offered the Chechen view of news from the front.</p>
<p>Yet Maskhadov has shown more than just an aptitude for making war.</p>
<p>He led peace negotiations which ended with the full Russian withdrawal from Chechnya.</p>
<p>Many in the Kremlin see him as the most pragmatic and acceptable of major Chechen political figures that it might have to deal with in future talks to resolve relations with Grozny.</p>
<p>Like his main opponents, he invokes the name of late separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev and shares with him a past career as a high-ranking officer in the Soviet army, where he was an artillery colonel.</p>
<p>This was rare for ethnic Chechens, who were not viewed in the Soviet system as politically reliable enough for leading military positions.</p>
<p>But similarities between him and the volatile Dudayev end there.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Dudayev) was rigid and loved emotion, while I always said we shouldn't rush to war,&quot; Maskhadov told Reuters recently. &quot;But on the question of Chechen independence, I don't differ one iota from him. We are a sovereign state,&quot;</p>
<p>The silver-haired commander has demanded reparations from Russia and said he plans to negotiate a share of revenues from lucrative Russian oil pipelines that cross Chechen territory.</p>
<p>Observers said before the vote the grey-haired commander's cool-headedness and pragmatism, along with his war record, would win over many voters and make him the leading candidate.</p>
<p>&quot;Maskhadov is very rational and calm, and he gives people hope that the next five years can bring at least some stability in their lives. Everyone is sick of war and upheavals,&quot; said Aslan Dukayev, a professor at Chechnya's State University.</p>
<p>Maskhadov toughened up his meek voice for the campaign, but made only one stump swing through the tiny republic. He did not even have a published political programme.</p>
<p>Unofficial early poll results gave Maskhadov 58 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>He is married and has two children.</p>
