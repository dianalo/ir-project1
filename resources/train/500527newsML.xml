<headline>FOCUS-UK shares rise but continental markets weaken.</headline>

<p>European share markets diverged at the Channel on Thursday as continental bourses drifted downward while London shares motored higher.</p>
<p>Wall Street's weakness on Thursday had little impact as its overnight selloff had already pulled European stocks lower at their open. London quickly rebounded, and France and Germany spent the day hovering at their lower levels.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar faced a barrage of potentially conflicting comments. U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said a strong currency was in U.S. interests and that the country's dollar policy had not changed.</p>
<p>The dollar stabilised after Rubin's remarks, after stumbling earlier from its 55-month peak against the yen when two top Japanese Ministry of Finance (MOF) officials used tough rhetoric to try to support the yen.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency also edged lower on the day against the mark despite German officials breaking their conspicuous silence of the last few days with remarks that they were comfortable with the dollar's high level.</p>
<p>German shares fell 0.36 percent by the end of electronic trade while the Paris bourse closed down 0.37 percent. London also took an early dip in line with Wall Street's overnight fall, but the FTSE-100 index recovered to end up 20.9 points, or 0.49 percent, at 4,313.2 points.</p>
<p>At the close of European trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.29 percent or 19.26 points at 6,544.58.</p>
<p>Utility and drug stocks helped to drive the gains in London. Investors turned to utilities after press reports suggested that the opposition Labour Party's planned windfall tax on privatised utilities would be lower than some expected.</p>
<p>Drugs stocks rose after promising trial results on a new drug for treating Hepatitis B raised hope that pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo Wellcome may have a blockbuster drug on its hands.</p>
<p>Finance minister Kenneth Clarke held his final monthly meeting on monetary policy before the British election with Bank of England Governor Eddie George. Whether Clarke decided to hold rates steady at 6.0 percent or not will not be clear until around 0845 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts do not expect an unpopular interest rate rise, which many think needed to nip inflation in the bud, before the country goes to the polls, whoever wins. &quot;No one really expects an interest rate rise but no one can afford to be disinterested just in case,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Paris dealers had harboured slim hopes that the Bank of France might trim interest rates on Thursday. But the central bank left rates unchanged and the market consolidated lower in a narrow range after Wednesday's gains.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index was down 9.58 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,607.97 at the close.</p>
<p>The German market also ended down, with the DAX index closing 7.97 points or 0.24 percent lower at 3,351.49. The IBIS index, which measures electronic trading, later fell further and closed down 12.18 points at 3,352.58.</p>
<p>Dealers feared the impact of dollar weakening against the mark. German industry has benefited from the mark's weakness in recent months against the dollar and sterling.</p>
<p>Early in the day Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka issued one of the most explicit warnings yet about the dollar's sharp rise against the yen. He said recent yen moves were &quot;obviously excessive&quot; and cautioned that such moves would be dealt with decisively and in a timely matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The comments from the MOF are clearly drawing a line in the sand, which is unnerving simply because the dollar has risen so far so sharply,&quot; said Mark Hendriks, international economist at SBC Warburg in London.</p>
<p>The dollar settled at 126.02 yen in late Europe compared with the high of 127.16 in Asia and Wednesday's European close of 126.83.</p>
<p>The dollar also rebounded slightly against the mark to 1.7177 compared with the previous close of 1.7250, although well off its earlier 37-month high of 1.7272 marks.</p>
<p>This followed comments from Bundesbank Council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher, who said: &quot;We do not need to strengthen the mark.&quot; The state secretary at the German finance ministry, Juergen Stark, also said a dollar/mark exchange rate over 1.72 was part of a normal market correction.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1600 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.7177 marks and 126.02 yen, compared with 1.7250 and 126.83 in late European trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT CLOSE</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was up 20.9 points at 4,313.2.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed down 7.97 points at 3,351.49. The IBIS index ended down 12.18 points at 3,352.58</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 index was 9.58 points lower at 2,607.97.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold closed at $347.85 an ounce after an afternoon fixing at $348.05 and compared with the London close on Wednesday of $347.60. Silver ended two cents higher at $4.81.</p>
