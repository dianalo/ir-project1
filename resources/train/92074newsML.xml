<p>Sony Corp is negotiating with a respected Hollywood executive for a top job at its troubled film studio in a move that will probably lead to the departure of Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Alan Levine, Daily Variety reported on Wednesday (Corrects from Tuesday.)</p>
<p>The trade paper's Wednesday (Corrects from Tuesday) edition said United Artists president John Calley, 65, is expected to take over many of the top production responsibilities at Sony, as well as many other duties now exercised by Levine.</p>
<p>Levine's status at the company is in flux, and there is only a &quot;slim possibility&quot; that he will stay inside the Sony hierarchy, the paper added.</p>
<p>After Sony suffered a dismal summer at the box office that capped several years of poor performances, Levine last month fired Mark Canton as chairman of its Columbia-Tristar Motion Picture Co. and warned staffers his own job was on the line.  </p>
<p>A month earlier, Canton and Levine had replaced TriStar Pictures president Marc Platt and Columbia Pictures president Lisa Henson.</p>
<p>Sony's summer releases fared badly with such entries as &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, &quot;The Fan&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot; and &quot;Multiplicity.&quot; Canton took movie star salaries to a new level by agreeing to pay Jim Carrey $20 million for &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, but he also turned down the opportunity to make &quot;Independence Day&quot; which ended up at News Corp's 20th Century Fox and has made more than $500 million at the global box office.</p>
<p>Calley has run United Artists for the past three years. The studio is part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which is being sold by Credit Lyonnais to a consortium of investor Kirk Kerkorian and Australia's Seven Network Ltd.</p>
<p>Daily Variety described Calley as &quot;a straight-shooting executive&quot; who is well-regarded by filmmakers, actors and talent agents.</p>
