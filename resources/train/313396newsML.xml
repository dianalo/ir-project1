<p>European Monetary Union including the southern European countries would be a &quot;lethal combination&quot; of economic instability, inflexible policies and no democratic accountability, a British politician said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Well-known &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; member of parliament, David Heathcoat-Amory, said a single currency including countries such as Italy and Spain, with their history of economic instability, would put excessive strain on the system.</p>
<p>At the same time, a single currency did not allow for any differences in economic circumstances, nor did it allow for any democratic or political representation, he told a conference on European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Macroeconomic instability, inappropriate interest rates and unrelieved stresses and strains will be the result,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he thought it was Germany's original intention that EMU be confined to a small group of strong northern European economies.</p>
<p>&quot;But it hasn't quite worked out that way,&quot; Heathcoat-Amory said, referring to Spain and Italy's drive to clean up their economic acts and aim for EMU in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you start to include those other currencies, it ceases to be an optimal currency,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Heathcoat-Amory said he expected the British public would find an independent European Central Bank (ECB) intolerable and would eventually reject EMU.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;There is such enormous amount of momentum behind it that I think it will happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Alan Walters, vice-chairman of AIG Trading Group, and former economic adviser to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, decried the fact that EMU included no escape valve.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got this irrevocability, no mention of escape clauses,&quot; he told the conference.</p>
<p>He said the drive to EMU was largely political and the European public were being railroaded into it at an enormous pace by countries' elites. &quot;Don't try and force convergence by a hot-house atmosphere -- all you get is spindly growth and eventual collapse,&quot; he said.</p>
