<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in the Czech Republic on Sunday for talks on NATO enlargement and an opportunity to look into her family's Jewish heritage.</p>
<p>Albright, on a tour of Eastern Europe after last week's North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit, arrived at Prague airport after a flight from the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Albright, who was born in Prague and speaks Czech, was due to visit the city's ancient Jewish quarter later on Sunday to look for the names of her paternal grandparents, who died in the Holocaust, on the memorial walls of a synagogue.</p>
<p>She was also due to examine documents at Prague's Jewish Town Hall.</p>
<p>Revelations about Albright's origins caused a stir in February when the Washington Post found she appeared to be of Jewish ancestry and that three of her grandparents had died in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Her official programme includes talks on Monday with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and other political leaders, including Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is one of three East European states invited by NATO last week to join the alliance. Zieleniec has said Albright's visit will be important for the accession talks process.</p>
<p>Albright, seen as a powerful friend by many Czechs, is also due to receive an award and deliver a speech on Monday before private talks with President Vaclav Havel.</p>
<p>She is due to leave for Washington on Monday evening.</p>
