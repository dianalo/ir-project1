<p>A pipeline project which will transport natural gas from the Yadana field offshore Burma to Thailand is expected to be completed on schedule despite some environmental concerns, a Thai official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on the current situation, we believe that the pipeline will be ready for operation by mid-1998, both from the Yadana field to the border and from the border to a power plant in Thailand,&quot; said a senior official at the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT).</p>
<p>PTT was in charge of laying the 260 km pipeline from the Thai-Burmese border to a 2,800 power station in Ratchaburi province. The whole pipeline from Yadana will be 699-km long.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters that PTT recently held a two-day technical hearing on the impact of the project on the environment.</p>
<p>Those who oppose the project claimed the pipeline will run through a first-class watershed area and preserved forests in Kanchanaburi province near the border and will also affect wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>The finding was presented to a panel of environmental experts for the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning which will deliver their conclusions on the project this month, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe the project will go through without any hurdle,&quot; said the official. &quot;PTT had studied the area for a long time before choosing this route which we believe has minimal impact on the environment.&quot;</p>
<p>He said PTT will soon sign an agreement with Tasco Management, a construction firm, to lay the pipeline.</p>
<p>The onshore pipeline laying from Burma to the Thai border is expected to be ready by May, he said. However, this schedule did not include any equipment installation.</p>
<p>The Yadana project will initially provide 325 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas to Thailand in 1998. Under the 30-year contract, the natural gas supply from the field will increase to 525 mmcfd in 1999.</p>
<p>Yadana's gas in place is estimated to be over five trillion cubic feet. PTT Exploration and Production Plc, a unit of PTT, holds 25.5 percent interest in the field, Unocal 28.26 percent, Total SA 31.24 percent and Burma state-run oil firm Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprice (MOGE) 15 percent.</p>
