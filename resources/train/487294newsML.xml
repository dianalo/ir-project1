<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares falling, downtrend seen.</title>
<headline>Russian shares falling, downtrend seen.</headline>

<p>Leading Russian shares eased on Friday morning and dealers said there was no indication the trend would reverse during the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Although everyone believes there will be (market) growth, the level at which clients are ready to buy is about five percent below the market,&quot; said a trader at a Western bank.</p>
<p>At 1120 GMT, UES electric utility had fallen to $0.1840 from $0.1910 at Thursday's close, after the State Duma lower house of parliament passed a bill limiting foreign UES holdings to 25 percent and preserving a state majority stake.</p>
<p>Volumes were relatively low.</p>
<p>&quot;The picture has not changed -- everything fell, and it is still falling,&quot; said Bank Menatep trader Alexander Maxin, referring to the UES bill, which to become law must still be passed by the upper chamber and signed by the president.</p>
<p>LUKoil oil company fell to $13.55 from $13.82.</p>
<p>Traders said that foreign investors, who have not strongly supported the market for weeks, were still not inclined to buy and that domestic operators who had propped up prices recently had also quit buying.</p>
