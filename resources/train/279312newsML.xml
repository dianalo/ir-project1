<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-PITTSBURGH'S ROOKIE FILL-IN GOALIE BLANKS BUFFALO.</headline>
<dateline>PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania 1996-12-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rookie Patrick Lalime made 21 saves for his second shutout of the season and Mario Lemieux had a goal and an assist as the Pittsburgh Penguins blanked the Buffalo Sabres 2-0 Saturday.</p>
<p>Lalime, pressed into service when Ken Wregget went down with a hamstring injury Thursday, remained unbeaten at 6-0-1. Lalime was 6-6 with Cleveland of the International Hockey League before he was recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been good so far,&quot; said Lalime. &quot;Hopefully, we can just continue doing the things we are doing right now. I'm really happy about the way I'm playing right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Patrick looked very comfortable in the net,&quot; Lemieux said. &quot;He made some key saves early on. We are playing very well right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, which began the season with two wins in its first 11 games, improved to 18-15-4 and is one point behind the Sabres for first place in the Northeast Division.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a big win for us,&quot; said Lalime. &quot;We are only a point behind and we are going for first place, where we belong.&quot;</p>
<p>Fredrik Olausson broke a scoreless tie 66 seconds before the first intermission.</p>
<p>At Los Angeles, Rene Corbet's goal snapped a tie at 3:40 of the third period and Craig Billington made 25 saves to post consecutive wins for the first time this season as the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Kings 5-2.</p>
<p>The Avalanche moved into a tie with The Dallas Stars for the best record in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>Stephane Fiset stopped 34 shots and has lost five straight decisions since defeating the Avalanche -- his former team -- on December 7. Los Angeles fell to 1-7-1 in its last eight games.</p>
<p>In Uniondale, New York, Vyacheslav Kozlov scored twice to continue the resurgence of Detroit's Russian contingent as the Red Wings routed the Islanders 7-1 for their third straight win.</p>
<p>Greg Johnson also tallied twice and red-hot Sergei Fedorov added a goal and an assist for Detroit, which received three goals and six assists from Russian-born players.</p>
<p>At Tampa Bay, Benoit Brunet scored his second goal of the game off a goalmouth scramble with 9:42 left in the third period and the Montreal Canadiens rallied from an early two-goal deficit to tie the Lightning 4-4 in a matchup of struggling teams.</p>
<p>Brunet, who also had lifted Montreal into a 3-3 tie in the second period, slid the puck past goaltender Rick Tabaracci, who was sprawled on the ice.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Thibault replaced Pat Jablonski midway through the second period and turned aside all 19 shots he faced for the Canadiens. Valeri Bure also scored twice for Montreal, which is winless in its last seven games (0-4-3) and in its last five on the road (0-1-4).</p>
<p>At Washington, Peter Bondra scored with nine seconds left in the third period to lift the Capitals to a 1-1 tie with the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>Washington pulled goaltender Olaf Kolzig with just over a minute remaining for an extra attacker. Michal Pivonka had the puck in the right corner and threw a pass to the low slot.</p>
<p>Joe Juneau took a shot that was stopped by goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck, but Bondra poked the rebound between his pads, spoiling a chance for his 25th career shutout.</p>
<p>Robert Svehla gave the Panthers a 1-0 edge with 6:13 left in the first period.</p>
<p>In Hartford, Steven Rice's second goal of the game with 4:47 to play snapped a tie and lifted the Whalers to a 3-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators.</p>
<p>Nineteen-year-old Jean-Sebastian Giguere made 30 saves for his first NHL win. The Whalers extended their unbeaten streak over Ottawa to six games (4-0-2), improving to 1-0-1 against the Senators this season.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, Bill Guerin had his first two-goal game of the season and Dave Andreychuk added a goal and an assist, leading the surging Devils to a 5-3 victory over the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.</p>
<p>Guerin had gone seven games without a goal, but scored at 8:24 of the second period to lift New Jersey into a 2-2 tie.</p>
<p>New Jersey, held to one goal in its previous two games, improved to 8-2-2 in December.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Kirk Muller's goal with 3:20 to play snapped a tie and lifted the Maple Leafs to a 5-4 win over the Chicago Blackhawks, snapping their four-game home losing streak.</p>
<p>Todd Warriner had two goals and an assist for the Leafs, who also broke a five-game losing streak against Chicago.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, Doug Weight scored twice and Ryan Smyth and Kelly Buchberger each added a goal and an assist as the Oilers erased a two-goal deficit and beat the San Jose Sharks 5-3.</p>
<p>The win was the Oilers' second in their last 10 games (2-5-3).</p>
