<p>U.S. Treasuries were slightly easier by Tokyo midday on Wednesday, but activity was slow ahead of the 10-year note auction, traders said.</p>
<p>The Treasury will sell $12.0 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday. The results are due at 1345 EDT/1745 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's near-term direction depends on the outcome of today's 10-year and Thursday's 30-year auctions,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. brokerage house in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The 6-5/8 percent 30-year bond stood at 101-22/32, yielding 6.50 percent, as of 0300 GMT. The long bond ended down 5/32 at 101-24/32 on Tuesday in New York.  </p>
<p>The 6-5/8 percent 10-year note was at 102-24/32, yielding 6.24 percent, compared with Tuesday's New York close of 102-26/32.</p>
<p>Traders said Japanese players are carefully watching to see whether the dollar rises above 120 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/yen is at a crucial level and opinions seem to be divided. Some say the dollar is already at its peak for the time being, while others see the dollar breaking above the 110-120 yen trading range,&quot; said the U.S. brokerage house trader.</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 119.40/42 yen in Tokyo as of 0300 GMT.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve will release its August Beige Book report for the August 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A trader at a Japanese bank said the report is unlikely to have any significant impact on the market as most operators do not expect the Fed to tighten credit in August.</p>
<p>The September T-bond futures contract was down 5/32 to 114-14/32 from the previous close. It was moving in a range of 114-19/32 to 114-13/32.</p>
