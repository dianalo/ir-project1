<p>President Clinton Wednesday proposed spending $174 billion over the next six years to improve the nation's highways, bridges and transit systems -- saying it will create thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, we're taking the next big step to maintain and modernise our transportation system and to make sure it is the best in the world,&quot; Clinton said in announcing the plan.</p>
<p>The National Economic Crossroads Transportation Efficiency Act &quot;will create tens of thousands of jobs for our people, help move people from welfare to work, protect our air and water and improve our highway safety,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The politically sensitive legislation, which affects members of Congress in every state, sets construction priorities for the next six years for highways and transit systems, including railroads.</p>
<p>&quot;It does the old fashioned work of investing in America's infrastructure in a very important way, but it also ties those investments to the challenges we face today and tomorrow,&quot; Clinton said at a White House unveiling of the plan.</p>
<p>The proposal would increase core highway spending by 30 percent, but also seeks increased spending for auto safety, environmental cleanup, new transportation technology and helping people move from welfare to work.</p>
<p>The measure also would allow states to charge tolls on federal highways if they pledge to spend the revenue on the upkeep of roads.</p>
<p>Clinton said his bill would increase surface transportation funding by $17 billion, or 11 percent, over the $157 billion that Congress authorised in its massive 1991 transportation funding bill, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.</p>
<p>He said his bill, known as NEXTEA, would give states and localities more flexibility in targeting federal dollars and would expand their opportunities to use innovative financing to leverage U.S. funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The change to reshape America's infrastructure comes along only once every six years. That means that this transportation bill literally will be our bridge to the 21st Century,&quot; said Clinton, resurrecting the catchphrase of his re-election campaign.</p>
<p>Clinton said NEXTEA would provide $600 million for innovative technology designed to cut travel time and improve safety.</p>
<p>The bill focuses on safety by increasing funds for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration by 25 percent to $395 million, for highway and truck safety by $2 billion, and for drunk driving prevention by 60 percent.</p>
<p>It also would create and expand programmes to encourage people to use safety belts and child restraints properly and it would continue research into building safer roads and cars, the White House said.</p>
<p>Clinton said NEXTEA would increase funds to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality by 30 percent, to $1.3 billion annually.</p>
<p>Funding to support bike paths, pedestrian walkways and other community projects would increase by over 25 percent, he said.</p>
<p>The bill provides $600 million to help people leaving welfare to find transportation, such as vanpools, to new jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;This bill is about more than roads and bridges,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;It's about those moving from welfare to work and our responsibility to help them get there.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the bill also gives states and localities new incentives to train workers for federally funded technology and construction projects.</p>
