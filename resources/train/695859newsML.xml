<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic has been detained by hardliners trying to oust her to prevent a crackdown on high level corruption, Bosnian Serb government sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Plavsic was being held near Bijeljina in northeast Bosnia, after failing to dismiss Interior Minister Dragan Kijac. </p>
<p>Kijac is loyal to ex-President Radovan Karadzic, still a powerful figure in the Bosnian Serb republic despite being forced from public office last year, and Momcilo Krajisnik, a member of Bosnia's multi-ethnic collective presidency.</p>
<p>Plavsic was detained on Sunday when she returned early from a visit to London to deal with Kijac's efforts to defy her with the apparent support of senior ministry officials.</p>
<p>Serbian police questioned her at Belgrade airport before escorting her to the Bosnian Serb border where she was handed over to Bosnian Serb police.</p>
<p>The sources said Plavsic wanted to replace Kijac because he refused to investigate two large companies headed by Karadzic and Krajisnik.</p>
