<p>British Prime Minister John Major said on Friday that Britain would not shoulder the burden of rising pension costs in other European Union countries, a danger highlighted by a parliamentary committee this week.</p>
<p>But he said the issue showed the government was right to take part in talks on Europe's financial future, rather than reject a single currency now and lose all influence over the outcome, as some &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; law-makers want.</p>
<p>The Social Security Committee said on Thursday that if Britain opted to join economic and monetary union in Europe, it could be hurt by high interest rates and inflation in the EU stemming from huge state pension liabilities in some countries. Taxpayers in the United Kingdom, where many pensions derive largely from funded occupational pension schemes, could find themselves subsidising the large unfunded pension liabilities of other member states, the report of the all-party group said.</p>
<p>But Major told business leaders in Nottingham, central England: &quot;No-one should think for a second that there is any prospect of the U.K. picking up other people's pension bills.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If anybody thinks that we are, then they absolutely make the case as to why we should be in the negotiations to ensure people don't proceed with an undesirable set of economic criteria, and that the British interest is protected,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Major said there had been much confusion over the issue, with people failing to appreciate the importance of occupational pension schemes in Britain compared with Germany, France, Italy and other European Union countries that faced massive and growing state pension liabilities.</p>
<p>The European Commission rejected the committee's warning in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no common fiscal policy, so the UK could not be called upon, under a single currency, to pay for the possible profligacy of any other country,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Major reiterated his rejection of the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty, which sets minimum working conditions for EU employees. His Conservative government negotiated an opt-out, but the opposition Labour party is committed to signing up.</p>
<p>&quot;I refuse to sign it because it will lead to higher unemployment and less competitiveness,&quot; Major added.</p>
<p>He backed the &quot;prudent&quot; quarter-point rise in interest rates decided by finance minister Kenneth Clarke on Wednesday and said firm control would be kept over the state budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to have to maintain firm control of public expenditure, not just this year but for good. In a world of footloose and fancy free capital, inward investment will go to those areas that have the most favourable economic climate.&quot;</p>
