<p>Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. on Thursday announced plans to acquire Northrop Grumman Corp. in a blockbuster $11.6 billion deal, the latest in a series of defence industry mergers in the post-Cold War era.</p>
<p>Lockheed-Martin produces the F-16 fighter, the C-130 cargo plane and the F-117 stealth fighter, while Northrop makes the B-2 stealth bomber. Combining the two would create a defence powerhouse with 230,000 employees, annual sales of about $37 billion and the firepower to take on Boeing Co., whose $14 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. has been approved in the United States but still faces stiff opposition in Europe.</p>
<p>It also comes as defence spending in the United States continues to fall, putting pressure on companies to combine forces to remain competitive.</p>
<p>This year, the Pentagon is expected to spend around $260 billion, down from $370 billion in 1987, the height of the Reagan-led military buildup.</p>
<p>&quot;We're building for the future ... to be more competitive in the global marketplace,&quot; said Lockheed Chairman Norman Augustine, who will lead the new Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>The deal surprised industry analysts because Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa, who will be vice chairman of the merged company, had repeatedly said Northrop was not for sale. As recently as May, Northrop bought Logicon Inc. for $740 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that Northrop has bid on in the past couple of years, Lockheed has bid on, too, and so you would have thought if (Lockheed) wanted to do this deal, it would have done it a few years ago and taken a competitor out of the marketplace,&quot; said Jon Kutler, an investment banker specialising in the defence industry at QuarterDeck Investment Partners.</p>
<p>However, with Raytheon Co.'s proposed acquisition earlier this year of Hughes Aircraft and the planned merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, Northrop had few alternatives.</p>
<p>&quot;The McDonnell deal made Boeing significantly stronger there, so I think this deal is somewhat in reaction to that,&quot; said Mark Biagetti, an analyst at First Equity.</p>
<p>Kresa said Lockheed approached Northrop in the second quarter about a merger and negotiations became serious in the past month.</p>
<p>Experts said the proposed deal could generate intense scrutiny among federal regulators, who this week quashed the proposed $4.6 billion merger of Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. on antitrust grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Regulatory bodies have been under heavy criticism for being too easy and they have been rather nasty lately ... so I certainly expect they'll give a good hard scrubbing to this deal,&quot; said Paul Nisbet of equity research firm JSA Research.</p>
<p>Analysts say the firms will likely face divestiture in the lucrative area of electronic countermeasures -- the ability of airplanes to send false signals that foil the radar on incoming air-to-air missiles and dozens of other ways of fooling the enemy.</p>
<p>But in the end, it will probably be the Pentagon recommendation to antitrust authorities that determines the outcome of the merger, said Steve Axinn, a New York antitrust lawyer with Axinn, Veltrop &amp; Harkrider.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Raytheon agreed to buy Texas Instruments Inc.'s defence electronics business for $2.95 billion, beating rival bidder Northrop. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said Raytheon could proceed with the deal if it sells some of the business' radar systems assets.</p>
<p>However, Lockheed's Augustine expects the deal will be approved.</p>
<p>Boeing said Thursday the deal would have little effect on its relationship with either company.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Northrop shareholders would receive 1.1923 shares of Lockheed for each share of Northrop. At current stock prices, the merger values Northrop Grumman at about $118 per share, based on early stock activity, a premium of about 33 percent from Wednesday's closing price of $88.875.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Northrop stock soared $21.125 to $110 and Lockheed fell $4.875 to $99.125, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The deal, which includes a breakup fee of about $200 million, is expected to close by the end of the year pending approval by shareholders and regulators.</p>
<p>Relations between Lockheed and Northrop grew closer in May when Northrop joined in Lockheed's bid to build the Joint Strike Fighter. The contract, which is the subject of a head-to-head battle between Lockheed and Boeing, is seen as the last mega-contract of the century, worth about $170 billion before spare parts and services are factored in.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., was once 17 separate companies. Over the last 20 years, the aerospace giant acquired the aircraft segments of General Dynamics, creator of the F-16 fighter jet and Loral, a group of companies specialising in electronics.</p>
<p>The 1995 merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta formed by far the nation's biggest defence contractor, but the proposed merger of McDonnell and Boeing poses a challenge to Lockheed's standing.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman, based in Los Angeles, was formed by the union of Northrop Corp. and Grumman Corp. in 1994. It employs more than 45,000 people and had 1996 sales of $8 billion.</p>
