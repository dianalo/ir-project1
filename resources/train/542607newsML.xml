<p>The timetable for Russia to join the World Trade Organization and the Paris Club of creditor states is still being worked out, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Summers told reporters Russian membership of the two organizations had been a topic at a meeting with First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais. But asked if a timetable outlined by Chubais was realistic, he replied: &quot;We are certainly working on that&quot;. (Corrects Summers' quote).</p>
<p>Chubais said on Sunday that Russia hoped to join the Paris Club by the end of this year and the WTO by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>Summers said he, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Chubais had discussed Russian reforms at a meeting on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;We discussed the importance of Russia being able to take the steps which will make it possible for them to join the Paris Club and the WTO as soon as possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very good discussion in which Secretary Rubin and I had a chance to express our admiration for Mr Chubais and what he has accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia, which is owed money by many countries in the developing world, wants to join the Paris Club to increase its chances of getting some of the money back.</p>
