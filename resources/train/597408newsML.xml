<p>South African President Nelson Mandela said on Tuesday he was working for the &quot;right&quot; trade relationship with neighbouring Zimbabwe, which complains that it is currently getting a raw deal.</p>
<p>Mandela, on a state visit to Zimbabwe, told a rally in the southern Masvingo province that his government was working for economic integration in the 12-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) that includes Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>&quot;So we are consulting thoroughly, as governments, in order to get the trade relationship between our countries right,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among other things, he said, South Africa was opening its market to Zimbabwean clothing and textiles, and exploring other areas to boost trade and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Trade relations between South Africa and Zimbabwe, its eighth-largest trading partner, have been strained by long-drawn-out talks on a new trade agreement.</p>
<p>Mandela, who ends on Wednesday his three-day state visit, the first to Zimbabwe by a South African head of state. He said on Monday the talks were &quot;on track but a sensitive issue&quot;.</p>
<p>Negotiations to update an expired 1964 trade agreement have gone on since 1992. Despite vehement denials, Zimbabwean business and government leaders have consistently accused South Africa of dragging its feet in concluding the agreement.</p>
<p>South Africa is Zimbabwe's largest trading partner in Africa but the trade is heavily weighted in South Africa's favour. In 1995, trade between the two nations totalled Z$10 billion (U.S.$885 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Boosting trade between us is important for creating growth, more jobs and balanced developed, But it is also only a part of the all-round relations between our countries that are strengthening by the day,&quot; Mandela said on Tuesday. ($=Z$11.29)</p>
