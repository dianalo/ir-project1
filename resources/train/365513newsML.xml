<p>Kirstie Marshall made winter sports history on Sunday when she won the women's aerials event at the world freestyle skiing championships while Nicholas Fontaine revived a Canadian tradition by lifting the men's title.</p>
<p>Both Fontaine and Marshall earned the highest scores awarded in aerials competition and in winning Marshall became the first winter sports world champion from the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>I never aimed just to be the best Australian because I was the only Australian, said Marshall.</p>
<p>Fontaine scored 254.98 points for two cleanly landed triple jumps to edge out American Eric Bergoust, who received 245.63 for the same two jumps.</p>
<p>I still can't believe I landed both jumps, Fontaine said before being hoisted aloft by fellow members of the Canadian Air Force&quot;, who have won four of five men's aerials titles since the first world championships in 1989.</p>
<p>Fontaine and Bergoust were the only two competitors to attempt two triple somersault jumps with double twists on either the first or second flips.</p>
<p>We both decided a few years ago that it would take more difficult jumps to win these competitions so we started working on them then, said Bergoust, who held the previous world record of 247.51 points set in Kirchberg, Austria, last year.</p>
<p>Marshall was awarded 197.92 points for two double jumps to break her own record of 186.5 set two weeks ago at a World Cup competition in the United States.</p>
<p>Michele Rohrback of Switzerland finished second with 177.84 ahead of Canadian Veronica Brenner with 176.79.</p>
<p>When I land both jumps, it's very difficult for anybody to beat me, said Marshall who has started work on a triple jump.</p>
<p>After winning three consecutive world aerials titles, the Canadian men were shut out at the last world championships in 1995, with American Trace Worthington topping the field.</p>
<p>It was what you call a wake-up call for us, said Canadian head coach Peter Judge.</p>
<p>Worthington, who has been diagnosed with Lost Move Syndrome&quot;, which affects the ability to sense one's position in the air, pulled out of the championships earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Canadians hired a new aerials coach last year, opened a new water ramp last spring and provided their male competitors with a special incentive in Nagano -- winning two medals would earn them the right to fashion their head coach's hair in the style of their choosing.</p>
<p>Judge is unsure what to expect.  I dont know, he said. A green Mohawk probably. It won't be pretty.</p>
