<p>Taiwan plans to legalise &quot;floating hotels&quot; just off the island's east and south coasts, housing sailors from China awaiting jobs from Taiwanese fishing vessels, a newspaper reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The plan followed repeated complaints by fishing companies and an increase in drownings among fishing workers from China during typhoons, the daily China Times said.</p>
<p>The boathouses or &quot;floating hotels&quot;, converted from old fishing boats to provide shelter for job-seeking Chinese sailors, have existed illegally in Taiwan's territorial waters since 1992.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Council of Agriculture was expected to make a formal announcement next week to legalise the boathouses in an attempt to keep watch over the sailors, the paper quoted council chairman Chiu Mau-ying as saying.</p>
<p>Chiu told the paper Taiwan's cabinet had approved the plan.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Taiwan would set up anchorage zones near the island's various fishing ports, which would allow better regulation of the boathouses by port police and fishery officials.</p>
<p>Fishing companies or agents could ferry the Chinese sailors from outside Taiwan's territorial waters to the boathouses in the anchorage zones.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Nationalist government, which lost a civil war to China's communists in 1949, bans direct contacts with China and does not allow mainland people to work for Taiwan companies.</p>
<p>But because of an acute shortage of sailors and fishing workers, authorities often turn a blind eye to fishing companies which recruit mainland Chinese.</p>
<p>The newspaper said as many as 1,000 mainland sailors stay at some 18 &quot;floating hotels&quot; outside Suao Harbour in northeastern Taiwan, making living conditions difficult.</p>
<p>At least 10 mainland sailors have drowned during typhoons since 1994.</p>
