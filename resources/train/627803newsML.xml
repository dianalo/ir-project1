<p>The fall in Australia's April retail sales on Friday confirmed that small businesses were being hard hit by low consumer confidence, opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said.</p>
<p>&quot;Small business is hurting,&quot; Evans said in a statement, adding that there had been no lift in consumer confidence or spending.</p>
<p>Retail sales fell 1.7 percent in April, seasonally adjusted, to A$10.29 billion, after falling 0.3 percent to A$10.46 billion in March, official data showed.</p>
<p>Evans also said the slight improvement in the current account deficit in the March quarter was not something the government could be proud of in a flat economy.</p>
<p>The current account deficit narrowed to A$4.587 billion in the March quarter from A$5.262 billion in the December quarter.</p>
<p>The government was also unlikely to meet its 3.25 percent growth forecast this year, or even growth of 3.0 percent, he said, pointing to its disastrous effect on jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the Prime Minister (John Howard) agrees we need a growth of four percent or better to significantly and rapidly reduce our unacceptably high unemployment rate.&quot;</p>
