<title>MALAYSIA: KL overnight rate rises on short-end squeeze.</title>
<headline>KL overnight rate rises on short-end squeeze.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A shortage of funds at the short-end of the market boosted the overnight rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight rate ended at 7.50/8.0 percent from 7.00/30 previously, trading in a range of between 6.80 and 9.0 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the mismatch of funds caused the overnight's rise, with foreign banks holdings a lot of funds while local ones were short.</p>
<p>&quot;The people who are long are the foreigners. They lend to Bank Negara before we can get at the funds at a higher rate,&quot; said a Malaysian bank dealer.</p>
<p>Other dealers said the squeeze was caused by banks shuffling assets to meet their requirements for the new month of June, including fulfilling statutory reserve requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of guys were short. There's a lot of transfers to the new period,&quot; said a dealer at a mid-sized bank.</p>
<p>Earlier, other interbank rates headed higher mainly on borrowings by small finance houses and merchant banks.</p>
<p>The one-, two- and three-week money were at 7.50/70 percent against 7.40/50 previously, dealers said.</p>
<p>The one-month rate was at 7.50/60 percent versus 7.50, with the smaller houses having to pay up to 7.70 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month money was at 7.50/60 percent, unchanged, and the 12-month at 7.60/80 from 7.50/80.</p>
<p>Malaysia's release of first quarter economic growth of 8.2 percent was ignored as it was largely within market expectations, dealers and economists said.</p>
<p>Bank Negara said the manufacturing sector expanded 12.9 percent, up from 12.5 in the last quarter and lower than 13.9 percent in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;GDP was slightly higher than what I projected. Manufacturing is the driver for the first quarter,&quot; said Zulkifli Hamzah, economist at Capitalcorp Securities.</p>
