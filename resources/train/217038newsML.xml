<title>RUSSIA: Russia drops Rothschild as telecoms sale adviser.</title>

<p>Russia has dropped London-based investment bank N.M. Rothschild as adviser on the sale of a stake in telecoms holding company AO Svyazinvest, the State Property Committee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;By agreement of both sides, the financial consultants -- a consortium of investment banks led by N.M. Rothschild -- have completed their work on this project,&quot; a statement from the State Property Committee, Russia's privatisation ministry, said.</p>
<p>The statement did not say who would take over as adviser, and a committee spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>The London Financial Times said on Tuesday that Russia's Alfa-Bank and Most-Bank would handle the sale in future.</p>
<p>The Russian Privatisation Centre, a Russian state fund, had been working with Rothschild on privatising Svyazinvest.</p>
<p>The committee, expressing thanks to the privatisation centre and to Rothschild, made clear that both institutions were no longer working on the deal.</p>
<p>The committee said that out of a series of options for selling Svyazinvest proposed by Rothschild and by the World Bank, the government had decided to transfer its 38 percent stake in national phone company Rostelekom to Svyazinvest.</p>
<p>&quot;In the opinion of (the committee) and the Telecommunications Ministry, the shares of the 'renewed' Svyazinvest will be more attractive to portfolio investors on the one hand, and on the other, privatisatising them will not have a damaging effect on national security,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Russia originally intended to sell 25 percent of Svyazinvest, which holds large but minority state shareholdings in 85 regional telecoms companies, to a single strategic investor.</p>
<p>Italy's state-owned telecom holding company Stet SpA won a tender last year for this stake, in what would have been Russia's biggest privatisation and inward investment to date, but the deal fell through before completion.</p>
<p>Officials had repeatedly said they would sell the stake this year, but the privatisation authorities are now planning to split it up and sell it to portfolio investors.</p>
<p>The recent sale of Russia's debut Eurobond and American Depositary Shares in gas monopoly RAO Gazprom have demonstrated enormous interest from portfolio investors in Russian paper.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen whether the Russian authorities will be able to attract foreign investors to Svyazinvest in the way they want without a Western investment bank as adviser.</p>
<p>The property committee said work was already underway on privatising Svyazinvest according to the new scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;If all sides agree in coordinating their work, it is expected that the first sales of shares of this company will take place at the beginning of next year,&quot; the committee said.</p>
<p>At 1010 GMT Rostelekom was $2.33 in a weaker market after closing on Monday at $2.42.</p>
