<headline>Hungary's forint ends below NBH bid on Czech crown.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-05-26</dateline>

<p>Hungary's forint was kept at lower than the usual levels within the central bank (NBH) intervention band amid uncertainty over what will happen to the ailing Czech crown, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably the market was a little nervous over what happened in the Czech Republic,&quot; said Europai Kereskedelmi Bank's Peter Piros.</p>
<p>The Czech crown has been pushed to lows by short-sellings in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The forint remained steady against the dollar and the (NBH) currency basket Monday afternoon, but it traded 25 to 50 pips below the NBH resistance level (bid), to which the forint is usually pinned.</p>
<p>The forint ended at 181.05/15 to the dollar, compared with 181.10 at midday.</p>
<p>At the closing it was 25 pips below the NBH bid, compared with some 50 fillers at the opening and 25 at midday.</p>
<p>Hungarian analysts said earlier on Monday that a protracted struggle in the Czech Republic for the crown was feared to harm investor confidence in the region.</p>
<p>Dealers said foreign currency purchases moved the forint on Monday more easily than usual as the turnover was low.</p>
<p>They said the forint was unlikely to return to the NBH bid until the Czech currency crisis is resolved.</p>
<p>Even if the forint eases further for the short term, Hungary's sound economic fundamentals will prevent it from falling more than some 130 pips below the resistance level, and it was likely to return to the NBH bid for the longer term, they said.</p>
<p>(The NBH intervention bannd is 4.5 percent wide. The forint floats against a currency basket made up 30 percent of the dollar and 70 percent of the mark.)</p>
