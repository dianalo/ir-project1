<title>UK: London gold glued to tight range in sluggish AM.</title>
<headline>London gold glued to tight range in sluggish AM.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-22</dateline>

<p>Gold consolidated quietly on Tuesday in early Europe but dealers said it may take another look at the upside later in the day if nearby support continues to hold.</p>
<p>&quot;We're close to where New York closed and there's not a lot of impetus to move from here this morning,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has mixed feelings, but another try at $330 looks fairly reasonable,&quot; he added, noting that physical offtake below $325.00 was underpinning the market for the time being.</p>
<p>Bullion was fixed virtually unchanged at $326.00 per ounce, compared to $326.20 on Monday afternoon and a London close of $326.40/$326.90.</p>
<p>Gold prices had come off highs on Monday afternoon after buying interest from U.S. investments funds pulled back.</p>
<p>Short covering by funds had been behind gold's rise from under $320 level last week, and dealers said their strategies would continue setting the tone in the precious metals markets.</p>
<p>Gold sank to 12-year lows earlier this month after news that the Australian central bank sold 167 tonnes of gold from its reserves prompted big amounts of short selling by hedge funds.</p>
<p>Silver, taking its lead from gold, was very quiet at $4.28/$4.30, hovering just one cent above the previous day's close.</p>
<p>The platinum group metals (PGMs), meanwhile, maintained their recently firmer tone against a background of ongoing uncertainty about Russian exports to Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese traders said shipments of Russian platinum had not arrived yet despite pledges by Russian PGM export agency Almazjuvelirexport to resume exports this week.</p>
<p>Almaz this month resumed palladium exports to Japan after a six-month suspension blamed on bureaucratic snarl-ups.</p>
<p>But traders said the volumes were not enough to ease supply tightness in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japanese must be getting very frustrated. A couple of weeks ago it looked like smooth sailing with the PGMs but there are still obviously problems,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Noone is getting into the PGMs if they can avoid it.&quot;</p>
<p>Platinum was last indicated at $414.00/$417.00, up $2.50, while palladium was up $3.50 at $192.00/$195.00.</p>
