<p>Two directors of Indian tobacco and hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd have been arrested in a widening probe into alleged violations of foreign exchange rules, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Enforcement Directorate on Monday arrested ITC executive director R.P. Agarwal and P.K. Talwar, finance director of ITC Bhadrachalam, a paper and packaging firm affiliated with ITC, an Enforcement Directorate official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The two have been arrested for their involvement in violation of foreign exchange rules and will be produced before a city court on Tuesday,&quot; Enforcement Directorate deputy director K.K. Kabirpanthi told Reuters.</p>
<p>Agarwal denied allegations he had broken foreign exchange rules.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a matter of sub judice,&quot; Agarwal told reporters as police escorted him to a local police station. &quot;I cannot say anything. But I don't agree with any of their allegations.&quot;</p>
<p>Talwar declined to comment.</p>
<p>With Monday's arrests, the number of people detained in the case which broke into public view last month when the Enforcement Directorate launched nationwide raids into homes and offices of ITC officials, has risen to 12.  </p>
<p>Among those arrested were two former chairmen and several serving or former senior executives.</p>
<p>The Enforcement Directorate is an arm of the Finance Ministry, which has said the violations involved up to $100 million in ITC's international operations.</p>
