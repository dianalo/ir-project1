<title>CANADA: Struck Cargill Alberta plant to hire new workers.</title>

<p>Cargill Foods Ltd will begin advertising for new workers to staff its 4,000-head-a-day cattle processing plant at High River, Alberta, a Cargill official said.</p>
<p>About 1,600 members of The United Food and Commercial Workers Union went out on strike at the plant last Thursday. Workers rejected Cargill's wage offer of a graduated C$1.50 an hour raise over 4 years. The union sought $1.95 over 3 years.</p>
<p>The plant employs about 1,800, including management.</p>
<p>Cargill vice president Barb Isman said the High River plant restarted its slaughter operation on Thursday after operating its processing facilities since the start of the strike from inventory at the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to operate the plant with supervisory personnel and workers who have crossed the picket line. Starting at the end of the week or by next week we will begin advertising to hire new, full-time permanent hires,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>Isman said no target for the number of new hires had been set. But she said the first round would not constitute replacements for striking workers but hiring that had been planned before the strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Following that, although this is our least preferred alternative, we would look at hiring replacement workers,&quot; Isman said.</p>
<p>Isman said no new talks with the union were scheduled.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no further plans to negotiate. We put forward our final offer prior to the union's decision to go out on strike, in the hope that there would be no work stoppage. But they did see our final offer,&quot; Isman said.</p>
