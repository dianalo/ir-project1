<headline>South Africa says no formal deal on trade access.</headline>

<p>The European Commission has agreed to grant South Africa partial access to the Lome Convention, opening the way for a free trade agreement with the European Union, the EU said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But South Africa said no official deal had yet been secured and discussions were continuing.</p>
<p>The EU commission said in a statement in Brussels that it had reached a milestone on Wednesday when it gave the green light to a draft protocol to the convention, which sets out the terms and conditions of South Africa's membership of Lome.</p>
<p>&quot;It was agreed that the trade benefits of Lome will not apply to South Africa. Trade relations will be governed by a separate bilateral agreement, which will contain provisions for the gradual establishment of a free trade area,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>South Africa's Department of Trade and Industry said in a statement no formal deal had yet been reached and it had not yet been informed of the council's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;No deal has officially been secured between the European Union and South Africa on qualified access in terms of the Lome Agreement to the EU by the Republic (of South Africa).</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware that the ambassadors and the commissioners of the EU met in their regular meetings yesterday. We do not want to speculate on what transpired in their meetings but if there is any decision which affects South Africa, we would expect to hear about it in the meeting taking place today.&quot;</p>
<p>Department spokesman Ismail Lagardien said South African experts were in Brussels for further talks.</p>
<p>South Africa and the EU said after hard bargaining in January they were moving closer to agreement on a free trade deal and partial membership of Lome -- which grants favourable access to EU markets to 70 developing countries elsewhere in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific (ACP).</p>
<p>The commission's decision has to be approved by the EU Council of Ministers before being submitted for approval to a joint EU-ACP Council of Ministers meeting.</p>
<p>The commission has recommended that the EU Council of Ministers adopt &quot;as soon as possible a common position on the draft protocol&quot;, the statement said, adding that a EU-ACP joint council would formally approve the protocol on April 24.</p>
<p>The EU, under pressure from its own farming lobby, has previously refused post-apartheid South Africa full accession to Lome.</p>
<p>Since trade would be excluded from an agreement, benefits from the Lome convention would include eligibility to tender for European Development Fund projects in all ACP countries. Trade will be dealt with in the separate agreement between South Africa and the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;At a political level, South Africa's membership of the convention and its full participation in all Lome institutions should have important positive effects.</p>
<p>&quot;It will undoubtedly increase the political weight of the ACP group of countries and influence the political dialogue between the ACP and the EU on many issues,&quot; the EU statement said.</p>
<p>The talks between Pretoria and the EU are taking place after South Africa announced its negotiating position on a trade deal with the EU last December, in response to the Brussels mandate presented in March 1996.</p>
<p>The EU has accused South Africa of dragging its feet while South African parliamentarians initially criticised the EU's proposal to exclude much of the country's agricultural produce from a future trade deal.</p>
