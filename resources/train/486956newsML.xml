<p>U.S. stock index futures ended higher in a late rally that started after U.S. bond futures closed for the day, diminishing -- if only temporarily -- the threat of higher U.S. interest rates, traders and other market analysts said.</p>
<p>Rather, Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures were perceived as fairly valued when June approached unchanged levels for the year, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;You saw a lot of bargain-hunting,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>They also said the technicals favored a short-term rally, as the market remained sharply oversold.  </p>
<p>In the last three sessions, including Friday, June S&amp;Ps closed below fair value of about 6.00 points.</p>
<p>Arbitrage buy programs were noted earlier in the day at about a premium of 6.73 points to cash. Traders said pit activity was choppy enough to push June S&amp;Ps into both buy and sell program levels within minutes. Arbitrage sell programs came in at about a 5.13-point premium.</p>
<p>While the 30-year bond yield continued to rise above the much-vaunted 7.0 percent level, traders said the U.S. stock market merely approached levels last seen at the beginning of the year, traders said.  </p>
<p>June S&amp;Ps' approach to the January 2 low of 740.00 led some traders and dealers to believe the market was undervalued. Floor sources noted strong dealer and hedge fund buying when June S&amp;Ps spiked to 747.00 soon after the opening.</p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, June S&amp;Ps were up 8.75 at 762.60, KCBT Value Lines were up 8.30 at 687.75, NYSE Composites were up 3.90 at 400.65, Nikkeis were down 140 at 17,975, Midcap 400s were up 3.40 at 254.35 and Nasdaq 100s were up 14.00 at 828.50.
