<headline>Japan, Kenya, Sweden elected to Security Council.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1996-10-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japan, Kenya and Sweden were elected by the General Assembly Monday to two-year terms on the Security Council, beginning on January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>But voting to fill two other council seats was inconclusive and further balloting was needed. Costa Rica appeared certain to obtain one of them.  </p>
<p>Kenya, the unopposed candidate for a Security Council seat reserved for an African country, will succeed Botswana whose term expires at the end of this year. Kenya received 172 votes, more than the required two-thirds majority of 120 votes out of the 180 delegations voting in the secret ballot.</p>
<p>Japan easily beat out India, by 142 votes to 40, for an Asian seat currently held by Indonesia.</p>
<p>Sweden was vying with Portugal and Australia for two seats reserved for the group known as West European and Others, now held by Germany and Italy. Sweden received 153 votes while neither Portugal, with 112, nor Australia, with 91, obtained a two-thirds majority.</p>
<p>Costa Rica and Bolivia, battling for a Latin American seat to be vacated by Honduras, both failed to win a two-thirds majority. Costa Rica received 105 votes while Bolivia, with 73, annnounced after the voting that it was withdrawing under a pre-election agreement that the candidate with fewer votes on the first ballot would pull out.</p>
