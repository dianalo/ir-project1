<p>British soft drinks to chocolate group Cadbury-Schweppes has made an encouraging start to trading in the second half of its year with most of the major orders for the busy Christmas period already taken, chief executive John Sunderland said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very early obviously, but we have had a fairly encouraging start and we also get a pretty clear picture about Christmas now because most of the major Christmas orders are already taken. So we feel confident about the outcome of our seasonal Christmas business,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The company makes about 60 percent of its profits in the second half of the year as confectionery sales surge in winter and at Christmas.</p>
<p>Sunderland expected the company to make two or three acquisitions in the confectionery area over the next year for between 100 and 200 million pounds each.</p>
<p>Cadbury sold its 51 percent stake in Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages Ltd in June for 623 million pounds, reducing its borrowings by 45 percent to 880 million at the half-year stage, providing it with more room to make acquisitions.  </p>
<p>&quot;The opportunities are more in confectionery than beverages because the end game in beverages is far more played out in terms of consolidation. The top three guys have over 80 percent in beverages whereas in confectionery the top six have less than 50,&quot; said Sunderland.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I think you can expect to see the pattern we have had in previous years of one or two acquisitions in confectionery continuing. They are mid range acquisitions of between about 100 and 200 million and mainly of the infill type,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In North America, where there are worries in financial circles about the ability of Cadbury's subsidiary Dr Pepper/7UP to compete with the might of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo colas, Sunderland said the group has managed to slow the rate of sales decline of soft drink 7UP.</p>
<p>&quot;We have slowed the rate of decline. It was going down by about four percent per annum pretty steadily and we have bought that back to two and the trend is actually stabilising.</p>
<p>&quot;The core 7UP brand has actually grown. We have chosen to support the key brand and that is paying off gradually, but I don't want to be over optimistic,&quot; said Sunderland.</p>
<p>In the six months to June 14, Dr Pepper sales rose 4.3 percent, out growing overall soft drinks market growth of three percent. The United States accounts for about 40 percent of soft drinks sold world-wide. Some 60 percent of soft drinks consumed in the America's are colas.</p>
<p>Beverage sales in the United States make up some 60 percent of Cadbury-Schweppes total drinks sales and drinks alone in the region contributes about 35 percent of total group profits.</p>
<p>Cadbury-Schweppes reported a two percent increase in pre-tax profits at the half year to 236 million pounds, slightly above most stockmarket forecasts. Beverages contributed trading profit of 198 million and confectionery 105 million.</p>
<p>Sunderland said the group planned to spend slightly more than 350 million pounds on marketing in the second half, with the launch of a national television campaign in Britain for a new biscuit snack called Astros.</p>
