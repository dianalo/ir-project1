<p>The Czech trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed to 11.2 billion crowns ($352.5 million) in May from 15.4 billion in April, prompting widespread optimism that one of the country's worst economic ills may be on the mend.</p>
<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Monday that the January to May trade deficit was 64.62 billion crowns compared with 53.421 in the January to April period.</p>
<p>The CSU also revised downwards its estimate for the full year 1997 trade deficit to 160-180 billion crowns from a previously forecast range of 190-200 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the May trade deficit) is slightly better than we expected,&quot; said Vladimir Kreidl of Patria Finance.</p>
<p>&quot;The outcome is a positive signal since this is the first time in several years when the 12-month deficit declined - from 173 billion to 169 billion,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The trade deficit is widely seen as one of the economy's biggest weaknesses, indicating a lack of restructuring in industry and causing concern about the position of the crown.</p>
<p>In May the crown came under intense speculative attack from investors worried by seemingly unstoppable growth in the deficit. The central bank was forced to abandon its policy of fixing the currency within a fluctuation corridor tied to a mark/dollar basket and later that month floated the crown.</p>
<p>Although foreign currency dealers said the news was positive for the crown, they added there had been almost no change from morning levels of around 18.5 to the mark.</p>
<p>In the medium term they predicted that the good news, and better prospects, for the trade situation would be balanced out against expectations of gradually declining interest rates, leaving the crown almost untouched.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is a positive sign about the economy and the crown as well but still we have to think about high interest rates... from this point of view there is no room for a stronger Czech crown,&quot; said Milan Vavra of Komkercni Banka.</p>
<p>After floating the crown, the Czech National Bank (CNB) hiked the discount rate to 13.0 percent from 10.5 and left the last resort Lombard rate at 50 percent.</p>
<p>However, it has been gradually reducing rates in its short term money market operations. On Monday, the CNB set the two-week repo rate at 20 percent, down from 25 percent, in its last operation of a similar type last Thursday.</p>
<p>Although the crown has steadied since being floated it stands around 14.6 percent below its year-high in February against the dollar and 11.0 percent against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade figures will have already been affected by the currency depreciation in May and this suggests that June figures might be even better,&quot; said Charlie Robertson of Hilfe, adding that Czech trade figures had yet to feel the full force of the depreciation.</p>
<p>Robertson said the narrowing of the gap between import and export growth was a particlularly good sign. Imports rose 8.6 percent year-on-year in January-May compared with 6.7 percent growth for exports.</p>
<p>In January of this year, imports grew by 7.3 percent against a real terms decline of 2.2 percent for exports.</p>
<p>Equities dealers, whose market is far less fluid than foreign exchange, said Czech shares would be unlikely to feel any effect from the figures in the short term.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they added, if, as expected, the more positive trend in trade and other areas continued, equities would benefit in the longer term from the enhanced reputation of the Czech economy as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;In the second half of this year, all the important indicators should slightly improve compared to the first half and this should help the markets overall,&quot; said Radim Bajgar an equities delaer at ING Barings.</p>
