<p>Fresh off a row over the war on drugs, U.S.-Mexican relations have taken another nasty turn when Mexican legislators from all four parties in the lower house condemned a tough new U.S. immigration law.</p>
<p>One legislator on Monday even proposed  withholding $10,000 in debt payments to the United States for every Mexican deported until the dispute can be sorted out, and a consultant for the Mexican consulate in San Diego called the law &quot;racist.&quot;</p>
<p>The new law, set to take effect April 1, seeks to put some teeth into old laws, allowing for fines from $50 to $250 against mostly poor immigrants who cross the border illegally, seeking deportation for life against some.</p>
<p>Legislators in Mexico's Chamber of Deputies demanded that Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo pass along their protest to President Bill Clinton during the U.S. president's planned visit to Mexico this spring.</p>
<p>A measure signed by all four parties called on Mexico's foreign ministry to do all it could to pressure the United States into delaying the law.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to tell the North Americans for example that for each migrant worker that they deport to us we are going to stop paying $10,000 on the foreign debt,&quot; Deputy Cuauhtemoc Sandoval of the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution told his colleagues.</p>
<p>&quot;That $10,000 we are going to invest to create jobs in Mexico,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Mexican illegal immigrants are deported from the United States each year, a small minority in the massive tide that flows to the United States seeking jobs.</p>
<p>The Mexican-U.S. controversy on immigration follows a more contentious one over drug trafficking, in which Clinton, the House of Representatives and the Senate each took turns judging whether Mexico was worthy of &quot;certification&quot; as a full-fledged partner in the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The U.S. certification process was roundly villified in Mexico as trampling on the nation's sovereignty and a duplicious effort by the United States to blame Mexico for its enormous demand for illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Mexican passions perhaps are inflamed more only by the immigration issue. In the Mexican view, illegally seeking work in United States is an annual rite widely taken for granted as a noble effort to bring home the bacon.</p>
<p>Anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States has grown notably in recent years. In California, voters have attempted to strip illegal aliens of their benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;Migrant workers are not delinquents,&quot; said Francisco Dominguez of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). &quot;They merit respect for their personal dignity and a re-evaluation of their value in contributing to the economy and prosperty of the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Lilia Velazquez, a consultant for Mexican consulate in San Diego, gateway for up to half of Mexicans entering the United States, assailed the law in an interview with the Televisa television network.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they are racist, oppressive laws and very unjust that not only attack the undocumented immigrant but also the legal immigrant,&quot; Velazquez said.</p>
