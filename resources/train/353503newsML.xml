<title>UK: North Sea wet Brent trade active, Med cautious.</title>
<headline>North Sea wet Brent trade active, Med cautious.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>At least four wet Brent cargoes traded at steady levels on Tuesday, but a rumoured late trade at a firmer level and the keeping of today's sole Brent date gave the market a firmer tone later.</p>
<p>Physical Brents were confirmed done at March Brent +28 cents a barrel for a Feb 12-14 cargo, March +30 cents for a Feb 18-20 cargo, at March +27 cents for a Feb 17-19 loader and on a dated-related basis for another Feb 17-19.</p>
<p>A Feb 18-20 cargo clocked to a trading house on Monday was widely heard to be been sold on a Dated-related basis, and then rumoured to have been resold to a refiner as high as March +35.</p>
<p>The sole cargo nominated from the paper chains on Tuesday was kept by BP.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of misleading talk around, but overall it's definitely looking a stronger market than yesterday,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Other North Sea grades were quiet. A Statfjord was heard on offer at Dated Brent +55 cents, after a cargo loading Feb 27-March 1 traded at Dated Brent +53 cents late on Monday.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads were steady to slightly firmer. March/April was done at +44 and +45 cents, while April/May was talked at +39/45 cents.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs also moved higher, with this week's dates traded at March Brent +28 cents, and next week's at March +15 cents.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, the Urals market looked notionally weaker after one local refiner said that it had cut crude runs and others also complained of dismal margins.</p>
<p>At least three small Urals cargoes loading around the end of the first decade and a large second decade cargo were seen available, but sellers were reluctant to put price tags to their cargoes, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one is showing prices,&quot; said one trader.</p>
