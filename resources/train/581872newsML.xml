<title>UK: Sterling debt and futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Sterling debt and futures closing report.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-14</dateline>

<p>Gilts ended Wednesday comfortably in the black but dealers were surprised the market eased off its highs, particularly since U.S. producer prices posted their largest monthly drop since August 1993.</p>
<p>The June gilt future settled 10/32 higher at 110-17 having yo-yoed between 114-03 and 114-20 through the session.</p>
<p>&quot;Gilts have put in a reasonable performance but the other bond markets have probably got a little bit more catching up to do after recent events,&quot; said Jonathan York, broker at MeesPierson.</p>
<p>The gilt/Bund spread has shot in by about 40 basis points since Labour secured a landslide election win on May 1 and then quickly announced the Bank of England would be free to set interest rates. The spread, out at 175 basis points before the election, stood at 140 late on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Wednesday's set of economic data should certainly have helped the market. Despite another large fall in British unemployment, annual average earnings growth dropped back to 4.5 percent from five.</p>
<p>But an ever-tightening labour market must have kept gilt investors on the back foot. &quot;I think it is temporary relief,&quot; said James Barty, chief UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. &quot;I think later on this year we will see wage pressures starting to build.&quot;</p>
<p>If the British data were a mixed bag, a 0.6 percent drop in March U.S. producer prices, the largest fall in nearly fall years, should have been unequivocally good news for bonds.</p>
<p>But, as York pointed out, the T-bond future was trading not much more than a half-point higher by 1520 GMT.</p>
<p>For gilts, he said an inability to break above last Friday's high of 114-24 could spell a period of consolidation. &quot;We shot through 113 and a half so fast, there's still some work to down there.&quot;  </p>
<p>Thursday's spotlight will shine firmly on retail price data. The Reuters consensus forecast is for retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments to show a 2.6 percent rise year-on-year in April, down from 2.7 percent in March.</p>
<p>Headline RPI is expected up 2.5 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>&quot;They should be fairly friendly for gilts,&quot; York said.</p>
<p>Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said sterling's strength will help subdue high street inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all due to sterling,&quot; he said. &quot;Sterling has a massive impact on food prices because we import so much food. We should also see the benefit of lower oil prices.&quot;</p>
<p>The June short sterling future settled two basis points higher at 93.48. With the December contract at 93.08, the market is poised for only 50 basis points of further monetary tightening this year.</p>
