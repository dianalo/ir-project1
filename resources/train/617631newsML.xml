<p>U.S. Treasuries edged higher in London on Tuesday, attracting interest after a surprising outcome in French elections this weekend rattled European bonds, traders said.</p>
<p>But action was limited with little in the way of major data until the end of the week, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;This French election is weighing on the (European) markets a bit,&quot; said a trader at a U.S. bank here. &quot;We're seeing a little bit of profit-taking against U.S...and ultimately the U.S. market is holding in quite nicely.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark long bond was quoted at 95-17, yielding 6.983 percent at 1024 GMT, compared with 95.15 in Tokyo and 95.15 in New York on Friday. Both British and U.S. markets were closed on Monday for holidays.</p>
<p>European debt markets weakened on Tuesday after left-leaning parties outpolled the ruling centre-right in the first round of French elections on Sunday, throwing up doubts about France's committment to whip its books into shape for European currency union.</p>
<p>The second round of elections is next Sunday.</p>
<p>Traders said however, Treasuries were unlikely to move much ahead of Wednesday's auction of $16.5 billion of two-year notes and Thursday's auction of $12.0 billion of five-year notes.</p>
<p>Consumer confidence data at 1400 GMT would likely show U.S. spenders were still riding high in May, said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International here. &quot;It does suggest consumers are still pretty healthly but it has clearly slowed from the unsustainable pace of the first quarter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters had a consensus forecast of 118.1 for May, compared with 116.8 in April.</p>
<p>But the main data for the week would come on Friday when the first revision to first quarter GDP was due, along with Chicago purchasing manager and University of Michigan data.</p>
<p>By 1024 GMT, the June T-bond future was up 2/32 from Friday at 109-08 in automated trade. --Jacqueline Thorpe, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6176</p>
