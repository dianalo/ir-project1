<p>Four more people, including three leading members of French Guiana's independence movement, have been charged with arson following their detention and transfer to the French Caribbean island of Martinique, state-owned television said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The television report -- citing French judicial sources -- said Jean-Victor Castor and Fabien Canavy, both members of the Guiana Workers Union (UTG), and Jean-Claude Ringuet, a member of the Guiana National Popular Party (PNPG), were among those charged with setting fire to the home of French Guiana's state prosecutor, Jean-Luc Beck, during riots last November.</p>
<p>Both the UTG and PNPG favour French Guiana's independence from France.</p>
<p>Ten people, including Alain Michel, a founding member of the PNPG, have been charged and sent to Martinique this month for the attack on Beck's home. It occurred during a first wave of riots that shook the French overseas department on the northeast coast of South America during four days last November.</p>
<p>The arrests triggered riots in Cayenne during three nights in the last 10 days. The most violent incidents occurred last Thursday and left nine police wounded, including eight by gunfire.</p>
<p>Paramilitary riot police flown in from mainland France clashed with hooded and armed demonstrators in the town's centre.</p>
<p>Police fired tear gas to disperse crowds. Rioters fired hunting rifles and threw Molotov cocktail firebombs. Looters ransacked stores. Those owned by ethnic Chinese were hardest hit, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Officials said a total of 11 police have been injured during the three nights. One civilian bystander lost an eye when a tear gas grenade exploded in his face.</p>
<p>The alleged arsonists were arrested in French Guiana's capital of Cayenne on Tuesday and taken to Martinique aboard a French naval vessel. Their transfer to Martinique was to enable an independent public prosecutor to handle the cases.</p>
<p>French officials described those riots as &quot;a deliberate attempt to destabilise French Guiana.&quot;</p>
<p>French Guiana is the only non-independent territory on the mainland of the Western Hemisphere. Its economy is heavily dependent on subsidies from France and 23 percent of the population of 150,000 is unemployed.</p>
<p>Officials on Friday played down the rioting. Dominique Vian, French government representative (Prefect), told a news conference that the violence did not constitute an insurrection.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is not an insurrection, we are far from that,&quot; Vian said.</p>
