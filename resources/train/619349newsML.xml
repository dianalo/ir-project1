<p>Borussia Dortmund striker Karlheinz Riedle used to keep the mighty Juergen Klinsmann out of the German national team.</p>
<p>But then in recent seasons his soccer career became a nightmare of injuries and inconsistent form.</p>
<p>The good times returned in dramatic style on Wednesday for the 31-year-old forward when his two goals steered the German club to the biggest triumph of their history in a 3-1 victory over Juventus in the European Cup final.</p>
<p>Twice within five minutes in the first half Riedle showed the kind of deadly touches in the penalty area which in 1991 saw him preferred in the German side to the now national team captain Klinsmann.</p>
<p>Riedle showed great control for his first goal in the 29th minute, chesting down a cross from Scot Paul Lambert on the left-hand side of the box and firing the ball crisply into the back of the net with his left foot.</p>
<p>The second in the 34th minute was pure Riedle. He raced in at a corner from Andy Moeller and used his power in the air to head the ball into left-hand corner.</p>
<p>Afterwards team mate Stefan Reuter said Riedle had told the team before the match that he would score in exactly that way.</p>
<p>&quot;He said he had a dream before the match that he would score one with his left foot and another with his head. It is unbelievable, I know,&quot; Reuter said. &quot;But you could see he was in great form.&quot;</p>
<p>Riedle added: &quot;I had the dream last night. When the first one went in with my left foot, I couldn't believe it. So I thought 'Well, I'd better just keep on dreaming.'&quot;</p>
<p>The goals were completely against the run of play after Juventus had dominated most of the first half and looked a class above their German opponents.</p>
<p>But they marked the highlight of Riedle's career. In the celebrations at the end of the match the forward stood on the pitch hugging his wife who has had to share the difficult times in the last few years when Riedle's future in the game often looked in doubt.</p>
<p>Riedle's injury problems even continued in his moment of triumph. He had to come off in the second half after he broke a toe.</p>
<p>&quot;My biggest worry came 10 days ago when I thought I might not make this game because of my shin problem,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not normal the number of injuries I have had. I have thought about that a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>Coach Ottmar Hitzfeld added: &quot;It is amazing that a player who has been injured so much can come on and score goals like that on such a big night. It shows how mentally tough he is.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a night of remarkable goals. Dortmund's 20-year-old Lars Ricken produced a moment of brilliance which which will go down as one of the most amazing goals in European Cup final history.</p>
<p>Just 16 seconds after coming on for Stephane Chapuisat in the 70th minute, Ricken broke free down the right flank and lobbed the ball over Juventus 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi from some 20 metres out to give Dortmund a 3-1 lead.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the 'keeper was off his line and just went for it,&quot; Ricken said. &quot;But to score with my first touch of the match is just madness. I had noticed throughout that he stood quite a way off his line. But it felt like a film afterwards. I couldn't believe it.&quot;</p>
