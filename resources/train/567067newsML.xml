<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were called to open flat to firmer Wednesday, but gold once again made little progress in tackling upside resistance overnight, dealers said.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold was called up $0.40 to $0.80 from Tuesday's close of $341.50 an ounce.</p>
<p>Bullion was quoted at $340.60/$341.10.</p>
<p>COMEX July silver was called flat to 1.00 cent higher from Tuesday's close of $4.733.</p>
<p>Some light shortcovering dried up amid trader skepticism over any significant volumes of central bank gold sales.  </p>
<p>COMEX June gold was traded $342.50 to $341.40 in overnight ACCESS trading.</p>
<p>July silver was traded between $4.745 and $4.73 in overnight ACCESS trading. In London silver fixed lower at $4.721 on Wednesday from $4.752 on Tuesday, but good support was seen at $4.70.</p>
<p>On Tuesday COMEX silver stocks rose by 1,310,102 ounces to 192,174,748 ounces, while COMEX gold stocks fell 35,135 ounces to 910,877 ounces.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum and NYMEX June palladium were called to open flat to up $0.50 an ounce. Both remained rangebound in overnight trading.</p>
