<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares slide on back of Mosenergo.</title>
<headline>Russian shares slide on back of Mosenergo.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-22</dateline>

<p>Sales of Russian regional utility Mosenergo sent the thin shares market into a slow slide on Tuesday, said traders.</p>
<p>Leading shares, they said, could ease through the week.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 22 shares dropped 1.5 percent to 291.32 from 295.61 on Monday. Total market turnover was a low $28.3 million.</p>
<p>International long-distance telecom Rostelekom fell to $3.46 from $3.55 and national power utility UES slipped to $0.2090 from $0.2162.</p>
<p>Aton trader Alexander Bobolev said investors were not happy that Mosenergo still planned to issue shares, which it announced on Thursday and at its annual meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;But I would say that today's fall was on profit-taking,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mosenergo last week said it would put off proposing a share authorisation originally scheduled for the annual meeting but said the plan was still a company priority.</p>
<p>Trinfiko said trader Grigory Pinsky said aggressive Western selling of Mosenergo, the top-traded share by dollar volume on Tuesday, sent the market into a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Bobolev said the market could ease through the week, but said individual deals had an exaggerated effect in the thin market, generally considered to be under $40 million daily turnover in Russia.</p>
