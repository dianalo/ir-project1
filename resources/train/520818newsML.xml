<p>Blue-chip stocks rose Friday, but the high-tech sector lost some ground after a strong start fuelled by better-than-expected profits from Microsoft Corp.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial index was up 28.9 points, or 0.43 percent, at 6,687.50, while the Nasdaq Composite index, a baromoter of high-technology stocks, was up 5.96 points at 1,223.03 after reaching as high as 1,232.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancers led decliners by about 13 to 10 on New York Stock Exchange volume of more than 257 million shares.</p>
<p>The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged, leaving its yield at 7.07 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market also was feeling some heat from stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data released Friday.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment for April rose to 101.0, compared with 100.0 for the final March index, financial market sources said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market was looking for any sign of moderation in consumer spending and the overall eceonomy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that macroeconomic factors have stopped influencing the market at this point,&quot; said Phil Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. &quot;Once we get through the quarterly earnings, the market will flip and we'll start worrying about rates and the like again.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he felt the market was recovering despite a minor dip in the Dow Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We should expect more recovery. The market is improving,&quot; he said. &quot;We could have another test of the lows later in April or in May, but I would advise buying on the dip to exploit the long side.&quot;</p>
<p>Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane, said Microsoft had more of an influence on the overall market than it did on high techs per se.</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft did come out with good earnings, but there are other techs which had disappointing results or, in any case, the market did not respond to them.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens to Microsoft is not necessarily indicative of what you can expect elsewhere in the sector. Microsoft doesn't face the kind of competition that smaller stocks do. Money managers are apt to stay with Microsoft rather than buy other stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft, the most actively traded Nasdaq issue, was up 5-7/8 at 104. Late Thursday, Microsoft said its third-quarter profit jumped 85 percent to $1.04 billion, well beyond analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks rallied again Friday, reacting favourably to news that a key court verdict was again delayed and encouraged by expectations that a litigation settlement package was only weeks away.</p>
<p>Philip Morris Cos. Inc. stock was up 2-3/4 at a session high of 44-3/8, while RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., parent of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., was up 1-1/2 higher at 34-1/4.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Tobacco Index was up 7.22 points, or 2.53 percent, at 295.06.</p>
