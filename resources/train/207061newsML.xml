<title>ITALY: Italian anti-trust body fines Alitalia.</title>
<headline>Italian anti-trust body fines Alitalia.</headline>

<p>Italy's anti-trust authority fined Alitalia 415 million lire ($277,000) on Thursday, accusing the state airline of breaching competition rules.</p>
<p>In a damning report, the anti-trust body said Alitalia had &quot;impeded, blocked and restricted&quot; the arrival of new national airlines into the market.</p>
<p>The anti-trust watchdog, headed by former prime minister Giuliano Amato, launched an investigation in February after small Italian private airlines Air One and Meridiana complained that Alitalia was hindering their operations.</p>
<p>Finding in their favour, the anti-trust body said Alitalia had sought to block competition in three ways.</p>
<p>It said Alitalia, which was given the task of allocating slots at Italian airports in 1971, had used this privilege to its advantage -- especially at Milan's main Linate airport.</p>
<p>It found that Alitalia had &quot;systematically&quot; timetabled its own flights to take customers from rivals Meridiana and Aliadriatica, making sure its aircraft left between five to 10 minutes before those of its competitors on a number of routes.</p>
<p>Because of this, Aliadriatica, now renamed Air One, had been forced to abandon its services between Linate and the southern Italian cities of Brindisi and Lamezia, leaving Altialia the sole carrier on those destinations.</p>
<p>Similar tactics had forced Meridiana to drop its Rome-Venice and Rome-Palermo flights, the anti-trust body said.</p>
<p>Finally Alitalia had tried to snarl Aliadriatica's take off in southern Italy last year by ordering travel agents in the area not to print Aliadriatica tickets on Alitalia machines -- the only ticketing service available at that time.</p>
<p>The anti-trust body said Alitalia had now dropped the practice and had also offered to give up its slot-allocation role, but it nonetheless slapped a fine on the company.</p>
<p>Alitalia was not immediately available for comment. When provisional findings from the anti-trust report were released last month, the airline said that neither it, nor its slot coordinators had abused their positions.</p>
<p>It was the second time Alitalia had fallen foul of the anti-trust authority. In 1994, the Rome-based watchdog forced the company to change pricing levels on its Milan-Rome route.</p>
<p>Alitalia is speeding towards its ninth successive year of losses and last week unveiled a new, low-cost operating company which will eventually absorb all passenger activities.</p>
