<headline>TSE says to add new JGB futures options contracts.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) said on Tuesday it would add eight new 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures options contracts by the end of this year, mainly to meet hedging needs for over-the-counter cash JGB options.</p>
<p>Currently four contracts are listed -- the March, June, September and December -- each with maturities of six months.</p>
<p>The exchange plans to add April, May, July, August, October and November contracts, each with maturities of 40 days, so that one contract is exercised at the end of every month, a senior exchange official told a news conference.</p>
<p>Asked when these new contracts would start trading, the official said: &quot;We expect to launch them by the end of this year.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said it would likely take a while before market participants were prepared to use the increased number of contracts.</p>
<p>The official said the new contracts were expected to meet options, most of which mature within a month.</p>
<p>The move would be in line with bond futures options trading in overseas markets and provide market participants with more sophisticated means of investment.</p>
<p>The options are U.S.-style, allowing buyers to exercise them at any time before expiration.</p>
<p>When a contract expires, to receive profits, buyers currently need to notify the exchange that their positions are in the money.</p>
<p>Once the number of contracts increases, buyers will no longer be required to do so, the official said.</p>
