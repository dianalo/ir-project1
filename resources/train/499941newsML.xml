<p>Eastman Kodak Co today announced plans to increase marketing support for its Advanced Photo System products with what it described as the biggest product launch in the company's history.</p>
<p>Kodak did not provide a budget figure for the Advantix campaign, which combines television, radio and print, but said it would be noticed more than seven billion times by potential consumers in the United States alone.</p>
<p>The U.S. print campaign has already begun; television broadcast were to begin Thursday and run through 1997 in the United States, and the radio segments will begin airing later in the year.</p>
<p>An international campaign will follow, Kodak said.</p>
<p>Advantix, which uses traditional film with digital enhancements, was introduced in May 1996, but the company still considers it to be in the launch stage, a Kodak spokesman said.</p>
<p>Kodak said the ads will focus on Advanced Photo System features, such as error-free, drop-in film loading; ability to choose three print formats with a single camera; and photo file index print showing every picture on each roll of film, which make it easier to order reprints and enlargements.</p>
