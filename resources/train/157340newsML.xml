<p>Germany's low level of investment in India is cause for concern, Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chidambaram told German business leaders that German firms accounted for 134 of the 1,289 projects involving foreign equity participation which India approved between August 1991 and January 1996.</p>
<p>Of 2,797 cases approved by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board between August 1991 and May 1996, German firms accounted for 215 projects, he told the Sixth Asia-Pacific Conference of German Industry and Trade.</p>
<p>&quot;German investment in India has been quite low,&quot; Chidambaram said. &quot;A cause for concern is that the share of German investments as a proportion of global foreign direct investment flows has declined considerably.&quot;</p>
<p>Chidambaram did not provide any figures showing a decline in German investment.</p>
<p>The Indian finance minister said German firms were more active in collaborating with Indian companies. He said there were 1,230 such business &quot;collaborations&quot; today, including some 400 joint ventures.</p>
<p>&quot;While the level of German investment is low today, I am confident that it will increase in the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chidambaram said large, well-known German firms were well-established in India and encouraged medium-sized firms to set down roots.</p>
