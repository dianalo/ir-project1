<p>The U.S. economy is running at a healthy pace, and the outlook suggests growth will remain at sustainable levels over the next several quarters, said an official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.</p>
<p>&quot;My personal view for the next several quarters is for moderate growth, sustainable growth, roughly 2.0 and 2.5 percent,&quot; Kansas City Fed vice president and economist Stuart Weiner told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>Weiner, who stressed that his outlook on the economy reflected his personal analysis, said the prospects for the U.S. consumer were positive, adding that fundamentals continued to bolster the idea of a healthy retail sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very low unemployment rate, employment gains continue to be good, consumer confidence is at very high levels...the stock and bond markets continue to perform well.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many positives that it's hard for me to see anything on the horizon that would cause consumer spending to slow in a worrisome way ... I frankly don't see any risk on the downside at this point,&quot; Weiner said.  </p>
<p>The U.S. economy grew by a sizzling 5.9 percent in the first quarter. Official numbers for the second quarter have not yet been issued, but economists widely expect the economy to have slowed to sustainable growth levels in the period.</p>
<p>Weiner said one of the current puzzles bewildering U.S. economists is how the nation has managed to combine solid growth and extremely tight labor markets, and still shown no major signs of inflationary pressures in the pipeline.  </p>
<p>The Kansas City Fed vice president, who is a specialist in U.S. labor markets, said he believed that a combination of stiffer global competition and higher productivity gains may explain that phenomenon.</p>
<p>But Weiner said he was not willing to jump on the &quot;New Economy&quot; bandwagon, saying that he believed there was room to understand the current economic scenario within the realm of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU).  </p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly possible that (there) has been some measured and unmeasured productivity gain that has temporarily lowered the unemployment rate at which the U.S. economy can produce without any increase in inflation,&quot; Weiner said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I'm unwilling to go for the New Age view that seems to want to reject the whole NAIRU-Phillips Curve framework,&quot; the economist added.</p>
<p>Weiner said workers may have not yet realized the fact that productivity -- and the impact it may have on the compensation side -- has actually increased, which could temporarily serve to lower the NAIRU.  </p>
<p>Asked where he sees the NAIRU today, the economist said that &quot;it could be temporarily at the 5.5 percent level or even lower, which would be consistent with the lack of price pressures to date.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning specifically to inflation, Weiner said he was not concerned about recent deflation in the Producer Price Index (PPI). The June report showed a negative PPI for the sixth straight month, the first such string of declines since measurement began 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Weiner said that the PPI number, albeit widely used, was not as broad as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the inflation component of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>
<p>&quot;As you go to the broader indices, we haven't seen that deflation,&quot; Weiner said, adding that the core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has been steady around 3.0 percent over the past three years.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is still some upside risk to inflation given that the economy has reached the level of activity where it is now,&quot; he said.</p>
