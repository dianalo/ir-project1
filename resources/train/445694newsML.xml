<p>Cambodians use it to spice up soup or for an intoxicating smoke, but law enforcement officials worry about an unprecedented surge in exports of marijuana, recently classified as a dangerous drug.</p>
<p>A law signed by King Norodom Sihanouk on January 24 hands down jail terms for trafficking in hemp-derived marijuana and cannabis, which is still easily and cheaply available in markets.</p>
<p>Possession or use is punishable by jail terms of six to 30 days under the statute, Cambodia's first anti-drug law.</p>
<p>Police have begun taking faltering steps against cultivation and export of marijuana, but some foreign experts say the will to tackle the trade in it is not strong enough.</p>
<p>Some believe the problem will get worse, noting a lack of resources and finances, a weak judiciary, corruption, rivalry within the police and failure to arrest any suspects to date despite clear evidence against marijuana shippers.</p>
<p>A NEW MAJOR EXPORT</p>
<p>Police and customs in Europe, Africa and Australia last year seized almost 60 tonnes of marijuana in containers that came from Cambodia, a country not previously known as a major exporter of the drug.</p>
<p>&quot;If they have seized 56 tonnes you can be sure that more than 300 or 400 tonnes has been delivered,&quot; said an overseas narcotics expert, noting that police in Singapore and Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City confiscated more than 10 tons so far this year.</p>
<p>General Skadavy M. Ly Roun, head of the local Interpol anti-drug unit, said farmers in eastern and southern Cambodia had planted some 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of marijuana -- yielding about a ton per hectare -- to meet overseas orders.</p>
<p>This compared to around 100 or 200 hectares in 1993, according to one expert, who added that Cambodia was still a small producer compared to the United States, Lebanon and others.</p>
<p>EASY PROFITS, LAX POLICING</p>
<p>The potential profits are handsome -- farmers sell a kilo of marijuana for about $6-7, which will fetch some $3,000 in Europe, said the general. &quot;If they send one container and it's seized by customs in a foreign country, it's nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Bengt Juhlian of the U.N. Drug Control Programme, which helped draft the anti-narcotics law, said lax policing and weak laws along with Cambodia's development from a rural economy to a market-oriented economy helped explain the production increase.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of the last year has opened up a country very vulnerable to outside influences,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Charles Lutz, Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics attache at the U.S. embassy in Bangkok, said Thai traffickers were moving their cultivation operations to Cambodia as police had eradicated their production centres in Thailand.</p>
<p>Police said locals and foreigners were using legal businesses, including the growing garment sector, to ship out marijuana and hinted at corruption among customs and elsewhere.</p>
<p>FROM THE POT TO MARKET</p>
<p>Justice officials and police say they are beginning to score successes, while acknowledging they have been hampered by lack of legislation, limited funds and weak overseas contacts.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased with the cooperation we receive from the government,&quot; said Lutz, citing the formation of a U.S.-equipped and trained special counter drug unit.</p>
<p>General Skadavy M. Ly Roun said passage of the law would make it easier to crack down on farmers. &quot;Before they just planted it (marijuana) for consumption in Cambodia. They use it to make chicken soup, to smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;There's only one thing we can do. We have to destroy all the fields of marijuana... If we delay this the farmer will export it,&quot; he said. &quot;This year (the harvest) will be worse.&quot;</p>
<p>He also noted the establishment of an Interior Ministry committee last year to gather data on marijuana seized overseas as a step forward. But he criticised the decision in January to give Phnom Penh municipal police responsibility for investigating all narcotics cases.</p>
<p>SOME SAY THE WILL'S NOT THERE</p>
<p>Despite the praise from the DEA's Lutz, other experts believe Cambodian officials are going about things the wrong way and do not have the will to stamp out the trade.</p>
<p>Opposition Khmer Nation Party leader Sam Rainsy, noting there had been no arrests in connection with the marijuana seizures, claimed drug trafficking was growing with &quot;the complicity of political leaders and police officials in the pay of the Mafia.&quot;</p>
