<title>FRANCE: Airbus to bid on 100-plane order from China.</title>

<p>Airbus Industrie has put in a bid for China's requirement for 100 narrow-body passenger aircraft, estimated to be worth about $5 billion, an industry source said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The source said Airbus &quot;put in a bid&quot; but added that the European consortium does not expect to win the whole order, which may be split with Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which Seatle-based Boeing is acquiring.</p>
<p>China has a number of major regional companies seeking new aircraft to keep up with traffic growth. But any decision to buy Airbus planes is not expected before an official visit to China by French President Jacques Chirac in May.</p>
<p>Vice President Al Gore is also due to visit China in late March, for which high-powered diplomatic efforts have been underway to prepare multi-billion dollar contracts.</p>
<p>Boeing has held the biggest share of the Chinese market in recent years, with one out of every 10 planes it makes being sold to Chinese airlines in the last three years.</p>
<p>The U.S. company, the world's biggest commercial aircraft manufacturer, forecasts China and Hong Kong will need 1,900 passenger aircraft in the next 20 years, worth $124 billion.</p>
<p>Airbus believes, however, that it has a strong claim in the Chinese market, with a backlog of deliveries of 38 Airbus planes.</p>
<p>It won a commercial and political coup last April, during an official visit to France by Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng, when the Chinese authorities ordered 30 Airbus planes and signed a deal to work on a new 100-seater jet with a European group.</p>
<p>Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.</p>
