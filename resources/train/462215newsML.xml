<p>Two private Egyptian steel producers plan to file formal dumping complaints against imports from Saudi Arabia, Libya and republics of the former Soviet Union, officials and executives said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ahmed Ezz, chairman of the family business Ezz Group, told Reuters in an interview that the reinforcement steel producers had already complained informally to the Trade Ministry and the ministry would help them draft the formal version.</p>
<p>The other company complaining is Alexandria National Iron and Steel (ANSDK).</p>
<p>&quot;There have been huge imports of reinforcement steel from Saudi Arabia and Libya at cheaper prices,&quot; Ezz said.</p>
<p>Saudi steel imports, up to 40 percent of total imports, are estimated to be priced at between $30 and $40 a tonne less than local prices in Saudi Arabia, Ezz said.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year Saudi exports to Egypt were between 380,000 and 400,000 tonnes, about 20 percent of total local needs if we add Libyan exports as well,&quot; he added. &quot;And it is clear that they will continue at the same level this year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The other complaint is about dumping from republics of the former Soviet Union,&quot; Ezz said. He did not specify which republics. &quot;It is known that all producing countries have filed dumping complaints against them.&quot;</p>
<p>Government officials declined to say what measures could be taken. None of the exporting countries in the case are members of the World Trade Organisation and the government could take unilateral measures to restrict steel imports.</p>
<p>Egypt produces some 2.4 million tonnes of reinforcement steel a year, of which about 240,000 tonnes are produced by government-owned plants and the rest by private plants.</p>
<p>Ezz blamed &quot;outside factors&quot; for the higher prices of local products compared to the imported steel.</p>
<p>&quot;There are imbalances in burdens on the local party and those on the exporting party, such as custom duties,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't need protection but these (dumping complaints) are legitimate measures,&quot; Ezz said.</p>
<p>Government officials said that the two firms were too slow in taking formal procedures.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, they informed us verbally (about the complaint) but we are still waiting for formal forms and documents,&quot; Abderrahman Fawzi, head of the Trade Ministry's anti-dumping and subsidy department, told Reuters. &quot;We cannot start our investigations before we get the formal forms,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Dumping complaints are recent in Egypt and we don't have enough experience to file a complete complaint,&quot; Ezz said. &quot;The Trade Ministry has been cooperative and its experts are helping us in sorting the issue out,&quot; he said.</p>
