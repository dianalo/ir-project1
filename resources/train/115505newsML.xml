<p>Singapore shares dived in quiet trading with the key Straits Times Industrial index ending at an 18-month low on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The STII fell 31.07 points or 1.5 percent to end at 2,045.58 points, up slightly from an intra-day low of 2,039.16.</p>
<p>&quot;The decline was in response to news that a (recent) government land sale attracted only two low bids and also due to revisions for third quarter growth,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>A recent Business Times poll said economists expected third quarter growth to be an average of 3.4 percent, 1.2 percentage points lower than their forecasts in September.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the fall was exaggerated by trading error in Singapore Petroleum when one lot exchanged at $$1.08, down 69 cents. The share was last quoted at S$1.63/1.75.</p>
<p>Dealers said falls were especially bad for property stocks but volumes were thin. Total market volume was 69.98 million shares. Losers were ahead of gainers 252 to 78.</p>
<p>Bukit Sembawang headed the losers with a S$1.00 drop on trade of two lots and City Development lost 40 cents to close at S$10.40 with 755,000 shares traded. Several property-related companies, including Straits Steamship and UIC Ltd were traded to a year low. --Raj Rajendran (+65-870-3093)</p>
