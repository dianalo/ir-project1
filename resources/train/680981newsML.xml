<p>Sterling forged higher against other major currencies, setting new 59-month highs against the mark, amid expectations UK interest rates will rise soon to keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected economic data published last week have kept UK rate-rise hopes on the boil, and led some traders to revise up their expectations of how far rates will need to increase from 6.5 percent to keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>This has propelled the pound more than one percent higher against the mark since Friday to as high as 2.87, its strongest showing since July 1992.</p>
<p>Sterling has also leapt 2.3 percent against the yen and 1.3 percent to a five-month high against the dollar since Friday. Such broad-based gains propelled sterling's trade-weighted index to 101.5, its highest level since July 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling's having a good time right now, with the economy chugging away and interest rates having to go higher,&quot; said Ian Winship, a fund manager at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sunday papers are doing a good job of convincing people that the days of 25-basis-point moves are behind us and that rates will rise further than they were expecting.&quot;</p>
<p>Sterling was quoted at 2.8670/80 marks at 1340 GMT against 2.8605/15 late yesterday. Cable rose to $1.6667, the highest it has been since January 21, and was last at $1.6632/42 against $1.6548/53 Friday. Sterling/yen was at 191.85/2.20 against 190.31 late Friday.</p>
<p>Evidence of U.K. economic strength mounted last week, with traders focusing on a surge in retail sales which pointed to the need to curb consumption if inflation is to be kept in check.</p>
<p>Sales surged 1.1 percent in May, with the quarterly rate of increase at the highest since July 1988. A separate report showed M4 money supply growth unexpectedly rose in May.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth in the UK looks as if it has stepped up a gear,&quot; said David Philpotts, the UK economist at Schroeder. &quot;The economic numbers last week were all pretty strong and provided a pretty favourable backdrop for sterling.&quot;</p>
<p>While the underlying inflation rate hit the government's 2.5 percent target in April and May, analysts are expecting the Bank of England's new monetary policy committee to raise interest rates from 6.5 percent at its next meeting on July 10. September short sterling was down six basis points at 92.98, implying official interest rates of more than 7 percent by the end of the third quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The December contract is pricing in an additional quarter-point rate rise by the end of the year.</p>
<p>While traders are looking for sterling to extend its gains to 2.90 marks, such gains could prove short-lived.</p>
<p>&quot;There's too much froth at the moment,&quot; said Winship at Scottish Amicable.</p>
<p>The 19 percent that the pound has gained against a trade-weighted basket of 20 currencies since August 1996 has already taken its toll on U.K. exporters, such as British Steel, by eroding their competitiveness and the value of their foreign-currency earnings.</p>
<p>Any signs that the U.K. monetary authorities are sympathetic to their woes would puncture optimism about sterling's prospects as it did at the end of last year.</p>
