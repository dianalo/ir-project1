<title>BELGIUM: Belgian shares consolidate, some see correction.</title>
<headline>Belgian shares consolidate, some see correction.</headline>

<p>Belgian investors used the excuse of a U.S. market holiday to take profit on stocks on Friday, ending a three-day record run.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 leading share index  .BFX, after briefly reaching a new all-time record high of 2,494.40 points at the start, ended down 0.60 percent, at 2,473.19 points.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Belgian market's climb to near 2,500 points had left the market vulnerable and a correction was likely. But not all shared that view.</p>
<p>&quot;We can go higher. What alternative is there to stocks,&quot; one trader said, referring to low government bond yields.</p>
<p>Bel-20 blue chips were mostly marked lower, with only electronics group Barco, Generale Bank and chemicals and drugs group UCB ending higher.</p>
<p>Volumes overall were light, one trader said.</p>
<p>Big movements were limited to small caps, where a number of pieces of individual company news served to animate interest.</p>
<p>Shares in data communications company Telinfo rose 2.82 percent, recovering almost all its day-earlier losses, despite news the company planned a capital increase in the autumn to fund its expansion plans.</p>
<p>Construction and dredging firm CFE rose 3.57 percent to 11,600 francs. Brokerages have issued a rash of buy recommendations on the share in the expectation the company's DEME dredging unit will report bumper 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>Processed meat company Ter Beke ended down 2.73 percent at 3,200 francs on fears an outbreak of swine fever in Belgium will push up pork prices and squeeze its margins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Brussels bourse marked stainless steel firm Fafer 10 percent higher to 120,150 francs even though the share was not traded. News its family shareholders were looking for possible partner sent bid/ask prices soaring.</p>
