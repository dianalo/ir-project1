<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates steady as market remains tight.</title>

<p>Interbank rates remained steady after recent gains as the market continued to be short of funds, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said lack of any fresh liquidity inflows was expected to keep the interbank market tight until late next week.</p>
<p>Many dealers said they were waiting to see if Bank Negara would roll over a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill maturing next Wednesday. The central bank announces new issues of the bills ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>The Malaysian money market is closed on Friday for the Moslem Eid al-Adha celebrations.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from the maturity, there is no new factor to change the market's trend,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 7.80/90 percent, two-week was at 7.50/60 percent and three-week at 7.35/40 percent, all unchanged from Wednesday.</p>
<p>One-month to one-year were all trading between 7.35 and 7.45 percent, the dealers said.</p>
<p>The market tightened on Wednesday after an outflow of 500 million ringgit due to a Bank Negara bill.</p>
<p>The outflow coupled with a steady draining of foreign funds from Malaysia had tightened the market and pushed up rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was market talk that foreign funds were withdrawing from Malaysia, both from deposits and from the stock market, which has been falling sharply recently.</p>
<p>Last week, Bank Negara intervened to slow the ringgit's fall by selling nearly $200 million, dealers said. A 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue also reduced liquidity in the flush market.</p>
<p>Some dealers said there was also a persistent rumour about a possible long-term government bond issue soon, which would mop up further liquidity and roll over maturing bonds.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were steady across the board just ahead of the lunch break.</p>
<p>At 0420 GMT, three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate-based (KLIBOR) June contract was steady at 92.68, or an implied yield of 7.32 percent.</p>
<p>September was at 92.67, or 7.33 percent and December was down one point at 92.60, or 7.40 percent.</p>
<p>March 1998 contract was up one at 92.50.</p>
