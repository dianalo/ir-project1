<p>Healthdyne Technologies Inc said on Thursday that the independent inspectors of election certified that all seven of the company's nominees were re-elected as directors at the shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>The company said in a press release that shareholders approved Invacare Corp's proposals to fix the size of the Board of Directors at seven members, repeal certain bylaw provisions and allow special shareholders meetings to be called by the holders of 10 percent or more of the company's common shares.  </p>
<p>Pursuant to court order, the company said the independent inspectors have not tabulated or certified the contingent vote taken on Invacare's proposed bylaw relating to Healthdyne's Shareholders Rights Plan.</p>
<p>Healthdyne said six of its nominees received about 6.5 million votes, representing more than 63 percent of the votes cast and one company nominee received about 6.2 million votes, representing more than 61 percent.</p>
<p>The company also said that three of Invacare's nominees received about 3.7 million votes and the fourth Invacare nominee received approximately 4.0 million votes.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Invacare launched a non-successful, hostile bid to acquire Healthdyne in January. Invacare said it is still interested in acquiring Healthdyne, eventhough its latest $15 per share tender offer has expired on August 1.</p>
<p>Healthdyne designs, manufactures and markets technologically advanced medical devices for use in the home, as well as other specialized clinical settings.</p>
<p>Invacare makes durable medical equipment for the home healthcare market.</p>
