<p>Polish shares set a new 30-month high on Tuesday and analysts said the higher turnover and strong post-price-fixing buying signalled a rise on Wednesday, with Warsaw gains linked with recent bourse rises abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the rise here is linked with the bull market on many bourses abroad, and now the fact that a high has been beaten helps,&quot; said Pawel Tarnowski, an analyst at Raiffeisen Capital and Investment.</p>
<p>But some analysts said the significant supply accompanying the stronger buying after price-fixing on Tuesday signalled only slight growth on Wednesday and a quick slowing of the uptrend.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index rose 1.2 percent to 14,993.0 and turnover rose 5.9 percent to 140.3 million zlotys ($50 million) on both markets. Gainers led losers by 51 to 13 with 14 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said the treasury's transfer of 32.9 percent of bank PBR shares to state-owned  Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA announced after the market closed could have a neutral-to- negative effect on PBR since many had hoped a foreign bank would get the stake.</p>
<p>Analysts were surprised by the scale of top-gainer electromagnetic transmitter maker Relpol's 9.8-percent jump in active trade.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover was at 2.2 million zlotys ($0.8 million) with biggest mover bank BIG up 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units slipped 0.3 percent in 17.1-million-zloty ($6.1 million) continuous trade and were flat at 160 zlotys ($57) in the regular bourse session in a turnover of 30.1 million zlotys ($10.7 million).</p>
<p>Analysts said profit-taking on the units after their 11.9-percent surge since late September could result in their fall on Wednesday.</p>
