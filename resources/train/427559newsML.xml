<p>A rumbling row over France's plans to scrap a twice-yearly change to its clocks is set to come to a head on Tuesday at the start of the March 11/12 Transport Council.</p>
<p>At issue will be the European Commission's proposal to synchronise EU countries' switch between summer and winter time, a practice which puts clocks forward one hour each March and back in October to provide longer, lighter summer evenings.</p>
<p>Specifically, that would involve discussions on proposal COM(96)106 for an eighth summertime directive.</p>
<p>&quot;France has expressly said that she has difficulties with harmonisation,&quot; a Dutch diplomat told a news conference on Friday, adding that Paris wanted an opt-out from the plan to allow it to scrap the switch.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe irked several EU partners when he announced the plan in September, citing public opposition to what he said were disruptive changes long-opposed by farmers and found by some French economists to cost more than they generate in energy savings from lighter evenings.</p>
<p>Southern EU countries like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal have argued that longer evenings boost their busy tourist trades, allowing museums and other services to stay open longer.</p>
<p>Fourteen of the EU's 15 countries want harmonised clock changes, an easy qualified majority under the co-decision procedure, for which the parliament has already adopted an amendment in its first reading which backed France's position.</p>
<p>But the Dutch presidency are reluctant to force the issue, mindful of the traditional leeway granted to countries with particular political difficulties with a new piece of EU law.</p>
<p>&quot;(With) this type of issue, where sovereignty is very much involved, I think the normal inclination of a presidency is to get unanimity,&quot; he said, adding that the Netherlands' goal on Tuesday would be to bring &quot;clarity&quot; to the issue.</p>
<p>Failure to agree new rules before the end of the year will leave a legal limbo for 1998, creating confusion for timetable planners in schools and scheduled transport businesses.</p>
<p>In the absence of binding rules, countries would be free to do what they wanted, which for the majority would mean keeping the practice of stepping in time.</p>
<p>The legal void would mean France could keep the same time all year round although it has not yet decided whether that will be GMT plus one or two hours.</p>
