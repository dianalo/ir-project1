<title>UK: Brit-Borneo reports heavy oil drill result.</title>
<headline>Brit-Borneo reports heavy oil drill result.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>British-Borneo Petroleum Syndicate Plc said on Friday it had recovered abnormal oil samples of very heavy 8.6 degrees API at an exploration well in block Green Canyon 37 in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>API is a measure of oil gravity. The lower the gravity the heavier the oil. Heavy oil is generally cheaper than light oil.</p>
<p>British-Borneo said the result was &quot;very much anomalous&quot;, pointing to 20 to 30 degree API oil finds in nearby fields such as Morpeth, Lobster, Manta Ray and Arnold.  </p>
<p>British-Borneo, which has a 40 percent working interest in Green Canyon 37, said it and partners Kerr-McGee Corp and CNG Producing Company would conduct a &quot;thorough review&quot; of additional drilling opportunities before moving forward with the field.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an important asset to us and this well is a disappointment, but we have had such a wonderful run of luck it is not surprising that - as we explore what is a complex area - we have the occasional setback,&quot; chief executive Alan Gaynor told Reuters. British-Borneo's shares, London's star performer so far this year, fell 182-1/2 pence to 1,357-1/2.  </p>
<p>Gaynor said the review of all of the Green Canyon 37 data would take about six months, stressing the result of the number 1 exploration did not immediately rule out further work.</p>
<p>&quot;This well is a disappointment, but it does not write off the whole of the six block unit in the Green Canyon area. Far from it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd been hoping to have good quality oil which would allow us to take the project &quot;go&quot; decision this year,&quot; Gaynor added.</p>
<p>British-Borneo is only active in deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil exploration. A flow of positive drill results, upbeat broker comments and lingering hopes of a takeover bid had fuelled the company's shares, which surged a total 95 percent since the start of the year.</p>
