<p>U.S. foreign crudes remained pricey Friday compared to domestic alternatives, reflecting the closed trans-Atlantic arbitrage, traders said.</p>
<p>The spread between January West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent widened to widened to $1.15-20 a barrel, up about 10 cents from late Thursday, but still short of the level at which trans-Atlantic cargoes would be economic.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see any cargoes coming over yet, but they'll be here,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The notional price into the U.S. Gulf Coast would be around Jan WTI plus 50-60 cents, &quot;and buyers aren't willing to pay that yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Latin America, Argentine YPF signed a four-month term contract with Unocal for 12,000 barrels per day of Rincon crude, trade sources said.</p>
<p>Tosco originally held a term contract for 24,000 bpd, but opted not to renew when YPF raised the price, the sources said.</p>
<p>Unocal bid for and was awarded half of Tosco's prior contract volume, paying around February WTI minus 90 cents, around 40 cents higher than Tosco's price, they said.</p>
<p>YPF is expected to sell the remaining 12,000 bpd on the spot market.</p>
<p>In the U.S. aftermarket, a full boat of January paper Brent traded at $24.65 a barrel, 15 cents higher than the IPE settlement price, traders said.</p>
<p>A partial January Brent cargo changed hands at $24.35 a barrel, 15 cents under the London close.</p>
<p>Intermonth spreads were stronger, with Brent Jan/Feb trading at 71/72 cents, 11-12 cents over the London settlement.</p>
