<headline>LIFFE coffee futures lower as run-up fizzles-out.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>London coffee futures stepped back further in light origin trade selling by Monday midesssion after last week's fund-led rally.</p>
<p>But volume at 1,238 lots was meagre and it comprised mainly crosses and nearby switches.</p>
<p>Benchmark July gapped $10 higher but soon headed south to break its immediate $1,750 support. It ended midesssion at $1,742, down $15, after a low of $1,732.</p>
<p>A stronger support is seen at $1,700. Technically, analysts said the market could attempt another assault on the highs at $1,820 on the longer-term.</p>
<p>Traders said activity was expected to remain thin in the coming days in view of a trade conference in Valencia, Spain, later this week and the approaching four-day weekend in some European countries.</p>
<p>Last week's activity was also curtailed by several holidays in Europe.</p>
<p>Trading volume in New York has also shrunk considerably in the past sessions as the market took a breather after the recent sharp volatility.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, traders in Indonesia said although local supply was ample, there were expectations that it would be running out by the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The season this year is expected to be shorter than last year,&quot; said one. Indonesia is the world's top robusta coffe grower. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
