<p>Fledgling studio DreamWorks SKG has named former Tri-Star Pictures head Bob Cooper as head of production for feature films.</p>
<p>The company said Cooper, like all DreamWorks executives, has no formal title and will oversee theatrical motion picture development as the studio ramps up its production schedule to seven to 10 pictures a year.</p>
<p>Cooper will report directly to Steven Spielberg, who set up DreamWorks with former Walt Disney Co. executive Jeffrey Katzenberg and recording industry mogul David Geffen.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy that Bob will be a part of the DreamWorks features team and look forward to working with him,&quot; Spielberg said in a statement. &quot;I have always been a fan of his work, and was particularly impressed by his accomplishments at HBO, where he oversaw the production of many excellent feature films.&quot;</p>
<p>Cooper was ousted from Tri-Star, a unit of Sony Corp. , earlier in May after less than a year at the studio following a dispute over autonomy. Cooper, who was hired by former Sony Pictures executives Mark Canton and Alan Levine, wanted more autonomy than current Sony Pictures chief John Calley was willing to give.</p>
<p>Before joining Sony in 1996, Cooper was president of HBO Pictures. During his tenure at HBO, he was responsible for award-winning movies such as 1993's &quot;Barbarians at the Gate&quot; and &quot;And the Band Played On.&quot;</p>
<p>Cooper will take up his new post at DreamWorks in September.</p>
