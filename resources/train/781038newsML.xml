<p>Middle distance running entered a new era on Wednesday when Hicham el Guerrouj swept to an imperious victory over defending champion Noureddine Morceli in the world 1,500 metres final.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Moroccan, who has been closing in on Morceli's various world records all season, won his first world outdoor title with total confidence and with a maturity that belied his years as he left Morceli and an experienced field trailing in his slipstream.</p>
<p>El Guerrouj has been on the verge of emerging as the world's top middle-distance runner for the last two years and although his time of three minutes 35.83 seconds was pedestrian it was enough to end Morceli's six-year reign as world champion.</p>
<p>It was the style, power and youthful aggression of his running which hinted at the turning of the pages. Morceli in comparison, looked slow, leaden-footed and out of shape.</p>
<p>However, the personal tragedy he is enduring following the death of his younger brother Abdelkader in a car crash in Algeria two weeks ago was clearly a crushing burden.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very difficult for me, very difficult,&quot; was all he would volunteer after the race.</p>
<p>Morceli could well return to the form that has made him world number one for the past six years but, if he does, he will forever be up against a North African rival who has now fulfilled all his early promise.</p>
<p>The loss of his world crown compounds an already miserable season for Morceli in which little has gone right for him since he suffered an injury in his head-to-head against Haile Gebrselassie over two miles in Hengelo at the end of May.</p>
<p>His hopes of salvaging something from the race, if not the season, ended in the last few strides as another up-and-coming youngster, Reyes Estevez of Spain, who was 21 on Saturday, pipped him for the bronze.</p>
<p>Morceli, bidding to become the first man to win four successive world track titles, looked utterly spent as crossed the line fourth behind El Guerrouj, Fermin Cacho and Estevez.</p>
<p>Cacho clocked 3:36.63, Estevez 3:37.26 and Morceli 3:37.37, exactly 10 seconds outside his own world record time.</p>
<p>El Guerrouj's wait in the wings looked likely to end last year with the Olympic gold, but the fates were against him in Atlanta when he fell on the final lap of the final which Morceli went on to win.</p>
<p>This time there was no mistake and Morocco claimed its first champion in either of the two middle-distance events at a global championship.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a classic example of a sit and kick race with anybody having his chance,&quot; said El Guerrouj. &quot;My surge was devastating and after that it was just a matter of controlling the race. I am dedicating this medal to the King and the people of Morocco.&quot;</p>
<p>To cap the night, he was presented with his gold medal by fellow Moroccan Nawal El Moutawakel, who in 1984 became the first African woman to win an Olympic gold.</p>
