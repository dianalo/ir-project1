<headline>FEATURE - Sri Lanka sends army to deter wildlife park Tigers.</headline>

<text>
<p>The scorching hot sands and thorny brush of Sri Lanka's largest national park teem with boar, buffalo, elephants and a wealth of other wildlife which draw tens of thousands of visitors on safari each year.</p>
<p>But the parade of paying guests to Yala National Park, where huge elephant herds and the endangered Sri Lanka leopard are top attractions, slowed to a trickle this year after Tigers -- Tamil separatist fighters -- went on the prowl.</p>
<p>Guerrillas from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) between June and October mounted several raids into the park, giving jitters to a tourist industry which was already reeling after deadly terrorist bombings in the capital Colombo.</p>
<p>In June, local police said separatist guerrillas burned down two bungalows in the park, robbed some Sri Lankan visitors sleeping inside and let them go unharmed. There were no foreign tourists involved in the incident.</p>
<p>HEIGHTENED SECURITY</p>
<p>The incursion shocked a government which had thought the wildlife preserve in the far southeastern corner of the Indian Ocean island was beyond battle lines in the LTTE's 13-year war for a separate state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The government beefed up security and carried out a shake-up of park staff, but wary of negative publicity for the vital tourism industry, issued a statement attributing the raid not to the LTTE, but to an &quot;unknown group&quot;.</p>
<p>Local residents had long maintained, however, that small numbers of Tigers had been in the area on and off since 1986, stepping up their activities after the Sri Lankan army's capture of the LTTE's northern stronghold of Jaffna early this year.</p>
<p>After Tigers mounted raids in October in which they torched a third bungalow, robbed domestic tourists and abducted several jeep drivers and safari guides, local Buddhist clergy and business leaders lobbied the government to take action.</p>
<p>In early November, President Chandrika Kumaratunga ordered a military sweep of the park and surrounding sea. Army commandos, navy patrol boats and air force planes patrolled the 960 sq km (360 sq mile) park and reported no clashes with Tiger fighters.</p>
<p>Two platoons of 35 soldiers each have set up camps in remote areas of the park, carefully out of view of visitors. Reporters were forbidden to visit the camps or interview soldiers.</p>
<p>TOURIST CANCELLATIONS</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of cancellations as people, especially Sri Lankans, had been reluctant to come,&quot; said Dhammika Gunasekara, manager of Yala Safari Beach Hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;For three or four months we were really suffering -- not just our hotel, but the villagers,&quot; he said in an interview at the hotel, which was empty except for two British tourists and two Reuters journalists.</p>
<p>&quot;About 60 percent of the people in this area depend on tourism for their livelihood,&quot; Gunasekara said.</p>
<p>Premanath Lal, manager of a fleet of fishing boats whose lobster fishermen sell some of their catch to the hotel, said one of his crew was shot by Tigers as he fished off the coast of the park around the time of a raid.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of our fishermen -- 230 out of 350 -- left the area the same day as the shooting,&quot; Lal said, pointing to a barren peninsula from which he said the Tigers mounted the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;We came back after the army carried out the operation, but we're still afraid to fish at night -- even though that's the best time to fish,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The opulent, 63-room hotel staddles a sandy ridge between the Indian Ocean and a lagoon at the edge of the wildlife park, a location from which it is possible to hear the thunder of the surf and the cries of elephants at the same time.</p>
<p>DECEMBER PEAK</p>
<p>&quot;As of now we have got two army platoons to secure the park. The good news has spread and I've had quite a few calls from prospective visitors,&quot; Gunasekara said, adding that the hotel was fully booked for December, Sri Lanka's peak tourist season.</p>
<p>A strong December tourist turnout would cheer Sri Lanka, which saw tourist arrivals fall 30 percent in the first nine months of 1996 from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's top wildlife official said the Yala incidents had not affected conservation work and the government was determined to prevent the disruption of eco-tourism.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a jungle and movements of Tamil Tiger terrorists can take place,&quot; said N.W. Dissanayake, director of the Department of Wildlife Conservation.</p>
<p>&quot;Things will be all right, because the security forces are investigating those incidents and recently they did a mopping up operation,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>Foreign tourists interviewed at Yala said they were aware of the raids but saw nothing unusual on their safaris.</p>
<p>&quot;I know there's been trouble,&quot; said British tourist Mary Ann Smith. &quot;But the police and army are very good at keeping their eyes on us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I enjoyed it and I'll come back again,&quot; said Colin Beale, another Briton. &quot;What's the good of coming to Sri Lanka if you're going to stay in your hotel?&quot;</p>
