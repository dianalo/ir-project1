<title>UK: Reed shares indicated lower after results.</title>
<headline>Reed shares indicated lower after results.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-12</dateline>

<p>Shares in Reed International Plc were indicated lower in pre-market trade on Wednesday after the Anglo-Dutch publishing group reported 1996 profits lower than most analysts had forecast.</p>
<p>The shares were down 13-1/2p at 11.60 stg by 0818 GMT.</p>
<p>Reed announced pre-tax profits of 805 million stg, up from 723 million the previous year but below analysts' forecasts which ranged from 808.0 to 821.4 million stg.  </p>
<p>&quot;The figures were pretty much in line with what we expected but our forecasts were at the bottom end of the range,&quot; UBS analyst Colin Tennant said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the shares have had a good run and some people may have been disappointed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Reed co-chairman Nigel Stapleton told Reuters that headline earnings of the Reed-Elsevier group could be depressed by five percent if sterling's strength was maintained throughout the year.</p>
<p>But he noted that although sterling strength would have a negative effect on the earnings per share of Reed International, expressed in sterling, it would have a correspondingly favourable effect on the guilder EPS of Elsevier NV.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good news for Elsevier and bad for Reed,&quot; Stapleton said. &quot;(But) the two share prices are linked so much that Elsevier should pull Reed up in some respects.&quot;</p>
