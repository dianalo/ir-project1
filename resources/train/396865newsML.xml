<title>SPAIN: Spain to study constructing second Madrid airport.</title>
<headline>Spain to study constructing second Madrid airport.</headline>

<p>Spain will consider building a second airport for Madrid once expansion of the overstretched Barajas airport is well underway, Spain's Development Minister Rafael Arias Salgado said in an interview published on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as the construction of the third runway is well-advanced, we will name a technical group to study the possibility of a second airport in Madrid,&quot; Salgado told Spanish daily ABC.</p>
<p>Barajas, Spain's busiest airport with around 20 million passengers a year, has been struggling with an increasing amount of traffic in recent months.  </p>
<p>The government has awarded a contract to build a third runway which is expected to almost double capacity, but construction is expected to take almost two years.</p>
<p>Salgado said, however, he would try to speed up construction.</p>
<p>&quot;The tender established 22 months, but probably it will be finished in less, because it is my intention to introduce three and even four work shifts as soon as time permits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the government has introduced measures to ease overcrowding which have included using the local Torrejon military airbase as a makeshift airport to receive some flights.</p>
<p>Salgado said Torrejon could be a possible site for a second airport.</p>
<p>With European air traffic due to be fully liberalised in April, Salgado said Madrid must be well placed to take advantage of an explosion in air traffic as tariffs plummet.</p>
<p>&quot;Madrid could be an important centre for air traffic distribution and we must not lose this position, rather we must improve it, because it is a important source of extraordinary wealth,&quot; he said.</p>
