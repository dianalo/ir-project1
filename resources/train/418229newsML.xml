<headline>France's Megret says racial inequality fact-paper.</headline>

<p>Bruno Megret, number two in France's far right National Front Party, said racial inequality was &quot;a fact&quot;, a German newspaper reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Megret refused to distance himself from controversial comments made on the subject by his wife Catherine, who was elected mayor of Vitrolles last month, the Handelsblatt daily said in a release ahead of publication on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Vitrolles was the fourth town the National Front has gained in municipal elections, sparking alarm across Europe at the rise of racism and xenophobia in the country.</p>
<p>Megret said his wife's comments had been distorted, adding that she was politically inexperienced.</p>
<p>The new mayor, a political newcomer who ran in place of her husband, drew fire last week when she told another German newspaper, the Berliner Zeitung, the National Front wanted to instill fear in immigrants.</p>
<p>France's Movement against Racism last month said it was taking legal action against Bruno Megret for espousing racial inequality.</p>
<p>Megret added that he agreed with National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen for saying French President Jaques Chirac was on the payroll of Jewish organisations. &quot;As number two in the National Front of course I agree with Le Pen,&quot; he said.</p>
