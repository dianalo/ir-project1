<p>Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli travelled to Liverpool on Wednesday to hold talks with Everton manager Howard Kendall about a move to the English premier league club.</p>
<p>Everton's official telephone service for fans said Kendall had met Ravanelli, who is presently under contract at relegated Middlesbrough, at Manchester airport. They planned to hold talks later in the day after visiting the club's training facilities.</p>
<p>Everton have agreed a fee with Middlesbrough, believed to be around 7.5 million pounds ($12.6 million). Now the club want to agree personal terms with the experienced striker.</p>
<p>Ravanelli, who has three years to run on his contract, has been expected to leave Middlesbrough ever since the club were relegated from the premier league at the end of last season.</p>
<p>The Italian striker had been linked with Everton's city rivals Liverpool but the move fell through.</p>
