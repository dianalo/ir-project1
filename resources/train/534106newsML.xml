<p>Canadian bonds opened stronger in quiet trade on Thursday, as further gains in the Canadian dollar helped to boost prices amid a lack of significant economic data, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason is the Canadian dollar has strengthened overnight. That kind of gave us a little support here. Otherwise there are not many other stories,&quot; said David Yu, a fixed-income portfolio manager with Perigee Investment Counsel Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark rose C$0.10 to C$108.40 to yield 7.276 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 1/32 to yield 7.08 percent. The spread between the two bonds was 20 basis points, unchanged from the close of trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar opened firmer on Thursday after supportive comments from Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen on Wednesday. Speaking in Halifax, Thiessen said it is important to maintain confidence in the dollar and that Canada could not maintain a completely made-in-Canada rate policy.</p>
<p>Dealers said volumes were light as many investors focus on the release of U.S. economic data out next week.</p>
