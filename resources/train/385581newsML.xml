<p>Yemeni security forces have laid siege to mountain tribesmen holding a U.S. oil engineer hostage in the rugged interior of the country, security sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Joe D'ellaire, an engineer working for the U.S. engineering group Halliburton, was abducted on February 10 in the eastern Marib governorate by members of the Murad tribe, angered by a dispute over land with Yemeni officials.</p>
<p>The sources said the kidnappers were demanding compensation of $2 million or the return of a piece of land in the capital Sanaa they say was given to one of the tribal leaders, Sheikh Abdullah Abdrabu al-Mansouri.</p>
<p>&quot;The al-Juba district in the governorate of Marib has been under siege since late Sunday night,&quot; one source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Halliburton said in a statement it was working diligently with the Yemeni authorities to secure their employee's release.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been allowed to deliver food and clothing to the employee through our negotiator and all indications are that he is in good condition,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The tribesmen are holding the employee hostage in connection with a dispute with the government of Yemen,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The kidnappers, who are followers of Sheikh Abdullah, say land near the presidential palace had been donated to the tribal leader and later taken back by the Sanaa municipality.</p>
<p>Other leaders of the Murad tribe were also negotiating with Sheikh Abdullah's followers for the release of the American engineer, sources close to the negotiations said.</p>
<p>They did not say whether the other tribal chiefs were leading the talks on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>D'ellaire was abducted from Rig 1 on the Saad al-Kamel oilfield, about 300 km (185 miles) east of Sanaa, oil industry officials said.</p>
<p>He was one of 125 men stationed on the rig, they said.</p>
<p>In recent years, Yemeni tribes with grievances against the government or foreign oil firms have kidnapped scores of tourists, diplomats or other foreigners to use as bargaining chips.</p>
<p>The hostages, who have included an oil man from the private U.S. company Hunt Oil and another from U.S. oil services company Nabors Industries Inc, were all released unharmed.</p>
<p>Halliburton said its primary objective was to win the release of their employee.</p>
<p>&quot;Appropriate actions have been and are being taken to achieve these objectives,&quot; the company said. &quot;In the interests of the well-being of the employee, no additional information is being provided at this time.&quot;</p>
