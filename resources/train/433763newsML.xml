<p>Masked gunmen controlling an abandoned Albanian customs post on the border with Greece shot dead an Albanian man for refusing to hand over his money, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.</p>
<p>&quot;The customs post at Kakavia was now controlled by masked and armed Albanians who extort money from anyone wishing to cross,&quot; ANA quoted eyewitnesses as saying.</p>
<p>The Albanian, Musati Figiri, 31, refused to pay and was shot and seriously injured. He died later at the hospital of the northern Greek city of Ioannina, ANA said.</p>
<p>Albanian customs police and soldiers abandoned the border post over the weekend, after an anti-government armed uprising in the south, sparked by the collapse of pyramid savings schemes.</p>
<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha, pressured by the growing unrest, has agreed to form a new multi-party government and hold early elections but insurgents have snubbed his offer of amnesty and vowed to hold on to weapons looted from army arsenals.</p>
<p>Looters have been roaming the south, and on Tuesday an eight-storey hotel in the rebel-held Albanian coastal town of Sarande was ransacked and set ablaze, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the looters carried out furniture, silverware, toilet seats, doors and lamps before setting fire to the hotel in central Sarande.</p>
<p>A council set up by the town rebels said looters would be punished but people drove up to the hotel throughout the day, loading up Cars and trucks before driving off.</p>
