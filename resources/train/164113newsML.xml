<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Italian bonds/futures closing report.</headline>

<p>Italian bond futures shone out against their duller European counterparts in late trade, climbing around 50 basis points by the close, albeit in subdued business, dealers said.</p>
<p>Cash bonds were less buoyant but still firm and the lira held steady around the 1,003-1,004 per mark area.</p>
<p>Some traders said comments by Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi at the weekend had kept the market buoyant. Ciampi said the Rome government would apply to put the lira back into the exchange rate mechanism as soon as debate on the 1997 budget had finished, probably later in November.  </p>
<p>Ciampi also said Rome wanted a central parity against the mark of slightly above 1,000. Traders said previously people had expected a rate of around 1,050.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we're looking more at 1,000-1,010 so that helped the market,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The December LIFFE future was 49 basis points up at 123.69 in late trade while the July 2006 Btp was 14 basis points higher at 105.22.</p>
<p>Others said market gains were simply a recovery of ground lost in low liquidity trading on Friday when Italy was on holiday for a three-day weekend.  </p>
<p>However the mood was tentatively positive with some saying charts were positive near term. One cited a one-month moving average which started the day at 123.18 and from which the Dec future had accelerated once broken.</p>
<p>The outlook for the week includes final October consumer prices data for all Italy on Wednesday, with the year on year rate expected at 3.0 percent compared with 3.4 in September.</p>
