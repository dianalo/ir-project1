<headline>Juppe says France to sell frigate to Saudi Arabia.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe announced on Tuesday that France had signed a multi-billion franc contract to sell a frigate to Saudi Arabia and armaments for it and two other ships already sold to the Gulf kingdom.</p>
<p>Speaking five days before the first round of a parliamentary election dominated by unemployment, Juppe said the contracts would guarantee 2,600 jobs for five years. He gave no precise figures but each of the two frigates previously sold was worth about 9.5 billion francs ($1.66 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;This means billions (of francs) in orders and it's 2,600 jobs which are ensured for five years in regions which are very sensitive (to unemployment),&quot; Juppe told TF1 television.</p>
<p>A defence ministry statement said the vessel was an anti-aircraft frigate of the Swari-II category akin to French Lafayette-class frigates.</p>
<p>The ministry said the frigate, and the two others sold previously, would receive anti-aircraft equipment, probably ship-to-air missiles, equivalent to those aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle now under construction making the Saudi ships &quot;among the most modern in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Anti-submarine warfare equipment would also be included, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of the sale will be the state-run DCN naval construction firm and the Thomson CSF and Aerospatiale firms, the ministry said.</p>
<p>DCN would get work for 950 people, including in main sites Toulon and Lorient, Thomson CSF would have work for 850 people and Aerospatiale would have work for 500, the ministry said.</p>
<p>It added that work would be provided at 13 separate sites around the country.</p>
<p>The annnoucement was expected to be greeted with relief in the defence industry which has seen orders falling sharply in recent years.</p>
<p>The defence ministry described the contract as &quot;a new stage in the development of Franco-Saudi relations&quot; and underlined it followed personal efforts by President Jacques Chirac who desperately wants the centre-right coalition which backs him to to win the country's May 25-June 1 general election.</p>
