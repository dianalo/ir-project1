<p>Average commitment rates on U.S. 30- and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages fell a second consecutive week in the week ending June 13 from the prior week, Freddie Mac said Thursday.</p>
<p>Thirty-year mortgages fell 13 basis points to an average 7.72 percent, the lowest since a rate of 7.65 percent in the week ended February 28, 1997. Last week's 30-year rate averaged 7.85 percent.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year mortgages also fell 13 basis points to 7.27 percent from 7.40 percent, the lowest since a rate of 7.15 percent in the February 28 week.  </p>
<p>One-year adjustable rate mortgages dipped 11 basis points to an average 5.67 percent from 5.78 percent last week, Freddie Mac said. The ARM has not been lower since it stood at 5.61 percent in the week ended March 14, 1997.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 8.39 percent, the 15-year 7.90 percent and the ARM 5.91 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates have slipped lower in the last two weeks on news of slower growth and very low inflation,&quot; Freddie Mac chief economist Robert Van Order said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, the markets seem confident the Federal Reserve will not raise rates in early July and this gives us the indication mortgage interest rates will not rise much, if at all, in at least the near future,&quot; Van Order added.</p>
<p>On Friday the Labor Department will issue U.S. producer prices for May, and next week, May consumer prices.</p>
<p>Lenders charged an average 1.7 percent in fees and points on 30- and 15-year loans, unchanged from last week. They charged 1.5 percent on ARM loans, up from 1.4 percent the previous week.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac is a corporation chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities for investors.</p>
