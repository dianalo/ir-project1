<p>Financial markets will comb key labour data in the United States and Germany in the coming week for clues on the timing of the next U.S. rate rise and European economic and monetary union (EMU), economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. employment data is potentially the determining factor for the Fed,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London.</p>
<p>If February non-farm payrolls, to be released on Friday, are above the market consensus of 220,000, markets will position themselves for a rise in U.S. interest rates, economists said.</p>
<p>Market participants will also look at the average hourly earnings data with care, economists added.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forecast is for a 325,000 rise in the non-farm payroll and a rise in average hourly earnings of 3.9 percent,&quot; said Gwyn Hacche, international economist at James Capel in London.</p>
<p>&quot;If our forecast is correct, there could be a lot of anxiety in the bond markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gives the second part of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to the House Banking Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Greenspan sent the markets into a spin over the past week following the first round of his testimony, when he cautioned against inflation risks and the buoyant equity markets, and stirred up speculation of a rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The text of the second leg will be little different, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;The question the market will ask is, does the Fed mean it?'&quot;said Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, U.S. personal income data for January and the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) survey for February will emerge on Monday.</p>
<p>While U.S. markets watch for an interest rate rise, European securities will look for signs of a derailment to the EMU process, economists said.</p>
<p>Central to this will be German employment data for February, to be released on Thursday.</p>
<p>January data showed unemployment rising to 4.66 million, the highest level in Germany since the 1930s, and shook market confidence in Germany's ability to meet the Maastricht criteria by the EMU start date of January 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Another increase in unemployment will lead to the unwinding of convergence trades with peripheral currencies,&quot; said Hawkins.</p>
<p>German industrial and production data for January and fourth quarter gross domestic product will also be released next week.</p>
<p>In the UK, the monetary authorities hold their monthly meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting will be an irrelevance, given the proximity of the general election,&quot; said Hannah.</p>
<p>Britain must hold a general election by May 22.</p>
<p>Senior finance and central bank officials from Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Australia meet in Tokyo on Tuesday to discuss macroeconomic policies and foreign exchange, which may focus on the dollar/yen, economists said.</p>
