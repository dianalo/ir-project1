<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Wednesday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida said the Commission had taken a decision on voice telephony during its weekly meeting. A technical briefing took place after the midday briefing with a member of Commissioner Martin Bangemann's Cabinet and a Commission official.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said the Commission was discussing President Jacques Santer's communication on public services.</p>
<p>He also said the British media might have misunderstood one of Tuesday's cases from the Court of Justice on the Television without Frontiers Directive (89/552/EEC). The case does not limit member states' power to limit pornographic broadcasting, he said.</p>
<p>Spokesman Nicolaas Wegter said Commissioner Hans van den Broek was visiting Ukraine from September 11-13. The Commission wished to underline the importance of developing economic and political relations with Ukraine, he said. Van den Broek would visit the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and discuss measures to reform energy sector in Ukraine, Wegter said.</p>
<p>Spokesman Josep Coll i Carbo said a meeting was taking place from September 11-12 in Bonn on the third pilot programme to conserve the tropical forest in Brazil. Results of the meeting would be given at 1600/1400 GMT on Thursday in the press room, he said.</p>
<p>In reference to one of Tuesday's question, Coll i Carbo said the EU-Mediterranean partnership programme (MEDA) had been published in the official journal of the European Communities on January 1, 1996 (OJ-L-189).</p>
<p>Asked about EU-Belarus relations, Wegter said the Commission was following the political situation and its capacity and willingness to assure democracy in the country. The nature of the EU-Belarus relationship has not yet been established, he said.</p>
<p>Asked about news reports on Britain planning to reduce its culling programme, spokesman Gerrard Kiely said the reports were based on speculation and the Commission would not get involved in discussions on the number of animals to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida announced there would be a second briefing at 1600/1400 GMT.</p>
