<p>Canada sees a good chance of resolving a dispute over fur from animals caught in leg-hold traps that has led the European Union to threaten to ban most fur imports, Canada's trade minister said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Art Eggleton said after meeting European Union (EU) Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan: &quot;I think we've got a good chance of this agreement being approved.&quot;</p>
<p>Brittan &quot;said that he wants to see a successful conclusion of this and that he will be pressing for a successful conclusion, that is acceptance of the agreement that has been initialed with respect to furs,&quot; Eggleton said in an interview.</p>
<p>Brittan and Eggleton are in Singapore for a World Trade Organisation conference.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, EU environment ministers meeting in Brussels threatened to ban imports of fur from animals caught in leg-hold traps unless negotiators from Canada, Russia and the United States accepted more humane trapping standards.</p>
<p>Negotiators from Canada, the EU, the United States and Russia have been in talks for months seeking such a pact.</p>
<p>The EU had temporarily suspended a planned ban on imports of fur from muskrats, beavers and sable if the animals were caught with leg-hold traps, but the ministers instructed the EU executive body to take steps to implement the ban by April.</p>
<p>Eggleton said a final EU decision on the matter was several steps away, however, and that Brittan told him no ban would come while the decision was pending. But he did not rule out the possibility that individual European countries would impose unilateral bans.</p>
<p>Asked whether, if a Europe-wide ban were imposed, Canada would appeal it through the world trade body's dispute resolution mechanism, Eggleton said: &quot;Oh, absolutely.&quot;</p>
<p>In Ottawa on Monday, a Canadian official told reporters that if there were such an appeal: &quot;Canada has an extremely strong case and would win.&quot;</p>
<p>Canadian officials in Ottawa said the proposed agreement on fur trade would set improved standards that would be applied not just in Canada, the United States and Russia but also in the EU. They said they were confident a deal would finally be accepted.</p>
<p>But they said if a ban finally took effect, Canada would use the same argument that the EU had used in winning a case against the United States on a U.S. ban on tuna caught with nets that also catch dolphins.</p>
