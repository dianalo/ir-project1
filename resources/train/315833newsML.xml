<headline>Traders eye price as Telefonica fever rises.</headline>

<p>Enthusiasm about Spanish telecoms operator Telefonica ran high on Friday as it finalised details for the sale of the state's remaining 20.9 percent stake -- but traders worried the share offer price might be too high.</p>
<p>Telefonica de Espana, founded by U.S. operator International Telephone and Telegraph in 1924 and later nationalised, is one of Spain's most respected companies and the February 18 share offer is viewed with relish in markets both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>But traders are beginning to fear that the pre-sale excitement could push up the price of the shares, which are generally considered undervalued now, to unattractive levels by the time the price is set.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on the price,&quot; said an analyst with a London-based trading house. &quot;Most people would say it's undervalued now but if it keeps on climbing that undervaluing starts weakening.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares were up 35 pesetas at 3,350 at midday on Friday, more than double the price of the last public share offer in 1995.</p>
<p>A Reuters straw poll of analysts this week put the final price in a range from 3,200 to 3,400 pesetas, with the high end well in the danger zone. Most saw the 12-month target price at about 3,600, with little room to go higher.</p>
<p>Analysts expect strong domestic demand despite the price, just as it was for Germany's offer of Deutsche Telekom in November, but some think foreign buyers might go to one of the other European telecoms on offer.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the level is not so cheap compared to the real price, there are alternatives. Lately there has been a certain amount of excess offer of telecoms shares,&quot; an analyst with a German bank said.</p>
<p>In addition to the German and Spanish privatisations, both France and Italy are planning to sell off part of their state telecom operators -- France Telecom and Stet -- this year.</p>
<p>Another London-based trader said that as long as retail demand for Telefonica was strong, the sale would be a success.</p>
<p>&quot;The deal is much more workable when there's a lot of interest in the domestic retail tranche,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The home-based appetite for Telefonica has been strong ever since the late dictator Francisco Franco started building up the populist image of the company for share sales in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>The shares were affectionately called &quot;matildes&quot; after a radio and television spot that had a man on the street shouting up to his wife &quot;Matilde, let's go, the shares in Telefonica are ready&quot;.</p>
<p>Even in the last share sale in October 1995, considered a disaster internationally, small investors clamoured for a part of what is seen as Spain's top blue-chip company and swamped the domestic retail offer.</p>
<p>Analysts say Telefonica's main attraction and the reason it could do well internationally this time around is its growth potential, particularly in Latin America.</p>
<p>In addition, they say the operator's long experience in doing business as a private company compared to other European telecom operators makes it less vulnerable to competition once the market is fully liberalised in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;There's great potential for development of basic services in Spain,&quot; said an analyst with a Spanish brokerage. &quot;Telefonica has an advantage over other European operators because of its domestic growth potential and international diversification.&quot;</p>
<p>The general consensus among traders in the sector, most of whom are connected in some way with the sale and did not want to be named, was that Spain's operator was a solid company with a good track record on the bourse.</p>
<p>The only question was how much investors would be prepared to pay for Telefonica's growth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a great company and the most solid in the country that quotes on the bourse,&quot; an analyst in Madrid said. &quot;Its only disadvantage is its high price.&quot;</p>
