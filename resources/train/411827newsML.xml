<headline>FOCUS-Euro stocks weaker, dollar awaits U.S. data.</headline>

<p>European stock markets lost ground in morning business on Friday, unsettled by a weak finish in New York overnight, while the dollar was constrained to a narrow trading range against the rejuvenated yen.</p>
<p>A warning by Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan on Wednesday of a possible U.S. interest rate rise prompted subsequent losses on Wall Street and has dragged down European stocks.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks traded in London were mixed on Friday morning and dealers said they expected Wall Street to open steady to lower after Thursday's slide.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt the DAX index dropped from Thursday's record high in nervous trading amid speculation that the launch of European economic and monetary union (EMU) might not start on time.</p>
<p>But the Bundesbank and German Finance Ministry denied a market rumour that Germany was about to issue a statement saying EMU would be delayed.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculation that the Bundesbank plans to make a statement on a delay in EMU is complete nonsense,&quot; a spokesman for the central bank said, adding, &quot;We are not aware of any intentions which go in this direction.&quot;</p>
<p>By midday the dollar was struggling to make headway against the yen and shaky against the mark on the EMU speculation, traders said.</p>
<p>Comments by Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita giving a more upbeat assessment of Japan's economy and worries about the repatriation of funds by Japanese firms at the end of their fiscal year combined to boost the yen and cap the dollar's progress.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said selling of marks for yen was weighing on the dollar rather than any worries over U.S. economic fundamentals. With the dollar still backed up by strong economic statistics, traders said they were reluctant to sell.</p>
<p>A series of data due at 1330 GMT on Friday will give the latest readings on the health of the U.S. economy. Top of the bill is the revised gross domestic product figure for the 1996 fourth quarter and analysts said a weak result could pull the dollar lower.</p>
<p>Thursday's drop on Wall Street helped prompt the London stock market, Europe's busiest, to fall around three-quarters of a percentage point in morning trading, while sterling initially lost ground after a parliamentary by-election in which the ruling Conservative Party suffered a crushing defeat.</p>
<p>But markets had expected a win by the opposition Labour Party in the by-election -- and in a general election due by May -- and analysts said any downward move for the pound should be temporary. Sterling soon bounced back from its lows.</p>
<p>&quot;The effect of the by-election should not have a large impact because the unpopularity of the current government is hardly a surprise,&quot; said Klaus Baader, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Markets have traditionally regarded the prospect of a Labour government as a bearish influence. But although the FTSE 100 share index fell on Friday morning, dealers said a weak Dow was behind the move and the by-election result had little impact.</p>
<p>A clear-cut victory by Labour would be welcomed more than the possibility of uncertainty or a hung parliament after the general election. Analysts said markets should be relieved that the by-election could allay such fears.</p>
<p>French share dealers said their market's weak start was on the back of the Dow Jones Industrial Index's 58-point fall overnight but it had the potential to move higher, supported by a firm tone to bonds and the dollar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the bullion market, platinum was fixed at $398.75 per ounce, its highest since August 29, 1996, boosting gold in its wake.</p>
<p>Dealers said platinum's gains from Thursday's close of $386.00/$387.00 were driven by buying in Tokyo on concern about delays in Russian supplies.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1300 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6910 marks and 120.73 yen, compared with 1.6892 and 120.70 in late European trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sterling traded around 2.7565 marks and $1.6300 versus 2.7484 and $1.6266 overnight.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1300 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 35.7 points at 4,303.5.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 fell 16.27 points at 2,613.13.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index ended bourse floor trade 17.08 points lower at 3,259.64.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $360.60, up 60 cents and at its highest fix since January 3, boosted by strength in platinum. It later edged up to around $360.95. Silver added two cents to $5.27. Platinum was fixed at fresh high of $398.75 after heavy buying.</p>
