<p>Concerned that its most cherished symbol of postwar prosperity is being tarnished, Germany on Wednesday tried to calm currency markets that have hammered its beloved deutschemark in the run-up to European monetary union.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Peter Hausmann, following a cabinet meeting at which Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his ministers discussed the mark's slide on foreign exchange markets, signalled Bonn wanted to play down the mark's recent fall.</p>
<p>&quot;From a German perspective there is no reason to dramatise recent developments on foreign exchange markets,&quot; he told a regular government news conference in Bonn.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise of the dollar and the pound should be seen against the backdrop of economic developments in the United States and Britain. Speculative effects ahead of economic and monetary union could also have led to an overreaction on markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Europe's anchor currency, the mark, has been steadily losing ground against the dollar and the pound as markets become increasingly convinced Europe's planned single currency will be weaker than the mark when launched in 1999.</p>
<p>The very idea of currency devaluation is anathema to Germans who often recall the two periods of hyperinflation they have suffered in this century as they insist that Europe's currency must be as strong as the mark has been.</p>
<p>As the dollar touched 1.80 marks last week, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer weighed in, saying the long-awaited correction in the mark exchange rates was now well overdone and the mark had to enter monetary union as a strong currency.</p>
<p>This prompted speculation that the Bundesbank could free up its securities repurchase rate, allowing it to drift higher.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has kept a tight rein on the repo for over a year and again on Wednesday kept the repurchase tenders at a fixed rate of three percent rather than allowing banks to bid at different interest rates for funds.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel this week called the continuing slide of the mark an overreaction on the markets and barely concealed a threat of coordinated central bank internvention by Germany and its international partners.</p>
<p>But markets have shrugged off these efforts and after a confusing series of mixed signals from the government, independent analysts said this latest effort to calm the unruly waters of foreign exchange markets would likely backfire.</p>
<p>Waigel had set markets up late on Tuesday when he told reporters that cabinet planned a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But then the government denied there would be a formal statement and in the end the goverment spokesman read a prepared text at a news conference after the cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was too little too late.</p>
<p>&quot;The expectation had been that they would use much stronger wording than they did. We expect the markets to react to this in the opposite way -- that is by selling the mark and buying the dollar,&quot; said Gerd Mueller of BHF Bank.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what happened.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing a lifeline to the sinking mark, the government's efforts appeared to push it deeper into the waters of speculation and uncertainty about European monetary union.</p>
<p>The dollar hit a European session high of 1.8010 marks despite the statement, but fell back to 1.7968/78 by late afternoon. That compares to the 71-month peak of 1.8040 it scaled on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nick Parsons, forex strategist at Banque Paribas in London, said the market was not comforted by the Bonn statement.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an invitation to sell more marks,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not just a phenomenon which is driven by dollar strength, this is a period of all-round mark weakness and reflects insecurity about the German economy and EMU.&quot;</p>
<p>Although dealers tended to shrug off the government statement, they said there was a real risk of central bank intervention and that the government was sending clear signals about this to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they're telling you not to get too long of dollars around here,&quot; said Nick Probert, head of spot trading at Bank of America in London.</p>
