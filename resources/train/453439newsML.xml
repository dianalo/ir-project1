<p>Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko left hospital on Wednesday after cancer treatment and aides said he would return home later this week in a bid to halt a fast-spreading revolt.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66, was driven from Princess Grace hospital in Monte Carlo to his French Riviera villa in Roquebrune-Cap Martin, witnesses said.</p>
<p>His press service said he planned to fly to Kinshasa by the end of the week to lead an attempt to quell the rebellion in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>Rebels led by long-time Mobutu opponent Laurent Kabila have captured more than a fifth of Zaire, including the third-largest city of Kisangani, and vowed to march on to Kinshasa and topple the ailing president.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will actively work to contain the situation as soon as he returns home,&quot; Mobutu's son and spokesman Mobutu Nzanga said. &quot;He no longer needs to prove he is a patriot.&quot;</p>
<p>Aides said  would hold a photo session at his villa overlooking the Mediterranean on Thursday. The move appeared to bean attempt to quell reports that he is seriously ill.</p>
<p>The president's private airliner arrived in Nice on Tuesday night and was standing by to take him back to his country. Mobutu's white Boeing 727 and a cargo aircraft that transports his belongings were both waiting at the airport.</p>
<p>Mobutu, accused by opponents of massive corruption during almost 32 years in power, was admitted to hospital in Monte Carlo on Sunday for &quot;additional treatment&quot; after he had spent a month at his villa for a new bout of convalescence after prostate cancer surgery last August in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The political situation in the Zairean capital has been complicated by an attempt by opponents in parliament to oust Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, appointed by Mobutu, deepening the sense of political crisis.</p>
<p>A brother and a son of Mobutu and relatives of members of Zaire's central government have joined a growing exodus in the face of rebel advances in the east, police in neighbouring Congo said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Lubumbashi sources in the foreign community said that central government officials there and army officers had flown family members to South Africa on a special flight on Wednesday.</p>
<p>France expressed growing worry on Wednesday over events in Zaire, a former Belgian colony, and said it was taking measures to protect its citizens.</p>
<p>&quot;The current uncertainties have led us to take the necessary measures concerning the security of our citizens,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a regular briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in close communication with our European and American partners,&quot; he added. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>Rummelhardt said the attempt on Tuesday by Zaire's parliamentary opposition to oust Kengo was a particular concern.</p>
<p>Kengo is in Kenya where African leaders opened a meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday on the Zaire crisis with a strong call for negotiations to end the war tearing the country apart.</p>
<p>Mobutu has spent most of his time in Europe since his cancer surgery. His departure has repeatedly been announced as imminent by his entourage, only to be delayed for medical reasons.</p>
<p>The Congolese Red Cross said on Tuesday that members of Mobutu's family had taken refuge across the Zaire river in neighbouring Congo in the face of advances by the rebels.</p>
