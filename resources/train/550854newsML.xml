<title>USA: Giddings &amp; Lewis looking at alternatives.</title>
<headline>Giddings &amp; Lewis looking at alternatives.</headline>

<p>Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc again told shareholders Wednesday the company was considering alternatives to a $19 a share unsolicited tender offer made by Harnischfeger Industries Inc last week.</p>
<p>But company officials would not comment on specific options and shareholders did not press the point, asking only one question on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The board is evaluating all of our alternatives,&quot; retiring chairman Joseph Coppola said at the company's annual shareholders meeting here.  </p>
<p>When asked if $19, about a 40 percent premium over Giddings' closing price of $13.625 a share Friday, was a fair price, Coppola did not answer directly but reiterated the machine tool and industrial automation products maker's contention that the stock was undervalued prior to the Harnischfeger offer.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock price was much lower and undervalued,&quot; Coppola said.</p>
<p>Giddings &quot;is headed in the right direction and has the financial strength to achieve our goals,&quot; Coppola said.</p>
<p>Those goals include improving gross margins 15-20 percent in 1997, chief executive Marvin Isles said.  </p>
<p>Giddings reported a net loss of $37.8 million in 1996, including a $64.1 million pre-tax charge related to problems at its integrated automation business.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Giddings urged shareholders not to act on the tender offer until after the company reviews alternatives.</p>
<p>But analysts said this week the offer by Harnischfeger, an industrial equipment company based in Milwaukee, could be the best offer Giddings receives, though they added that Harnischfeger might be willing to sweeten the offer slightly to avoid a lengthy legal battle over Giddings' takeover defenses.</p>
<p>Giddings shares were down 3/16 at 19-7/8 Wednesday, while Harnischfeger was down 1-3/4 at 41-3/4.</p>
