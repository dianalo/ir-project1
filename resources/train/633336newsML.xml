<text>
<p>Thin supply sent most Bucharest share prices up on Tuesday, with brisk trading and three special trades on the first tier hoisting turnover to 8.8 billion lei, three billion up on the previous session.</p>
<p>&quot;There was little change in the pattern from the previous day. Sellers were still reluctant to throw shares in the market at current prices,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Traders expected further rises for at least two more sessions, with demand outstripping supply.</p>
<p>The average prices of 17 stocks went up, seven slipped and four were unchanged. Six companies had no trade and five were suspended. Most stocks also closed higher.</p>
<p>Two independent indices, the VAB and the BIG, which consider market capitalisation and average prices, rose by 1.7 and 1.65 percent respectively from Monday. The BIG first-tier index jumped by 1.56 percent to 3,052.7 points.</p>
<p>The first tier took 84 percent of turnover and four of five issues closed firmer. The fifth listing, newcomer Sofert fertiliser maker, had no deal and traders said selling orders for the stock had been absent.</p>
<p>First-tier pharmaceuticals companies Antibiotice and Terapia ended the session 100 and 350 lei higher at 4,600 and 6,100 respectively.</p>
<p>Azomures fertiliser maker gained 100 lei to close at 3,100 thanks to a special deal involving 158,000 shares. A second Azomures special trade -- a deal outside the market reported to the exchange later -- involved 136,919 shares worth a total 421.02 million lei.</p>
<p>Chemical plant Oltchim also had a special deal worth 282.48 million lei in which 117,700 shares changed hands. The deal helped the stock end at 2,400 lei, 50 lei stronger on the previous session and 150 higher than its opening.</p>
<p>Policolor  PLCR.BX dye maker took the bulk of volume on the second tier, where brokers said there was only thin trading in other stocks. It had 936 million lei in turnover and closed flat at 5,150 lei.</p>
