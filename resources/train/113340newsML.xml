<text>
<p>German police were still searching for a multi-millionaire Frankfurt businessman Sunday, three days after his brother paid a four million mark ($2.62 million) ransom to kidnappers.</p>
<p>Police said they had few clues to the whereabouts of Jakub Fiszmann, a 40-year-old businessman who was violently abducted Oct. 1. Police lifted a local news blackout Saturday in the hopes of obtaining tips from the public.</p>
<p>Authorities believe Fiszmann, a member of one of Germany's wealthiest but most publicity-shy families, is still alive and being held captive near Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Police confirmed reports the family has total assets that exceed 400 million marks ($262 million).</p>
<p>Fiszmann's brother paid the ransom, as the kidnappers had demanded, Thursday. But they did not release Fiszmann as promised, the authorities said.</p>
<p>The businessman runs a real estate and electronics company in Frankfurt.</p>
