<p>U.S. Midcontinent unleaded gasoline basis eased in Chicago as buyers failed to emerge on a bitterly cold day that dampened demand, traders said Friday.</p>
<p>An arctic blast that blanketed the Midwest in ice and snow this week trimmed demand and sent buyers to the sidelines, where they could remain until demand thaws out and inventory levels in the Williams pipeline system are worked down.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Midwest were expected to moderate over the weekend, but forecasts call for another arctic cold wave to sweep across the region by the end of next week.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's cold and icy outside, and people are just staying inside. Schools are closed, and no one is driving anywhere,&quot; one Chicago-area trader said of weak gasoline demand.</p>
<p>Unleaded gasoline was bid 2.0 cents a gallon under NYMEX February unleaded in Chicago and 3.25 cents under the print in Group Three, traders said.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel eased to bids 4.50 cents a gallon under NYMEX February heating oil in Chicago and 4.25 cents under the print in Group Three.</p>
<p>High sulphur diesel eased to bids 5.50 cents a gallon under the print in Chicago and 8.50 cents under the print in Group Three, traders said.</p>
<p>Jet/kero also was unchanged at 0.25/0.50 cent over the print in Chicago and 3.50/3.25 cents under in Group Three.</p>
