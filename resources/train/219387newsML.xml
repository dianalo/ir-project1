<p>The Cosmetic Center Inc said on Wednesday it signed a definitive agreement to merge with Revlon Inc's retail outlet subsidiary, Prestige Fragrance &amp; Cosmetics Inc.</p>
<p>The company said the new entity would keep the Cosmetic Center name. The deal is expected to close in early 1997.</p>
<p>Terms of the transaction are consistent with those announced on Oct. 1 when the companies executed a non-binding letter of intent.  </p>
<p>Cosmetic Center's class A and class B shareholders can exchange their shares to get either one share of Cosmetic Center's newly issued class C voting common stock or $7.63 in cash.</p>
<p>Holders of the company's employee stock options can choose equivalent options for class C voting common stock or, if their exercise prices are less than $7.63, cash in an amount equal to $7.63 less the exercise price for each option share, the company said.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, Revlon will limit to 2,829,065 the number of shares and options would be accepted for cash and prorate the rest.  </p>
<p>Revlon will receive about 65 percent of the newly issued class C voting shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis before taking into account shares and options exchanged for cash.</p>
<p>As of Sept. 30, there were about 4,296,134 shares of Cosmetic Center's Class A and Class B common stock outstanding and about 201,900 options with exercise prices of less than $7.63, the company said.</p>
<p>Mark Weinstein, the Cosmetic Center chairman, and certain family members, who together own about 51 percent of Cosmetic Center's Class B voting shares, agreed to elect to receive cash for all of their shares and options, subject to proration. As a result, Revlon would own at least 74 percent and up to 84 percent of Cosmetic Center's outstanding common shares, the company said.</p>
<p>Cosmetic Center operates 69 specialty retail stores with brand-name prestige and mass merchandised cosmetics, fragrance and beauty products at value prices. Prestige Fragrance &amp; Cosmetics has a chain of 198 retail stores located in outlet malls that sell surplus and discontinued cosmetics and beauty merchandise.</p>
