<p>---------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar opened flat around C$1.3870 (US$0.7209) in light trading on Thursday after the currency was sidelined overnight in overseas markets, traders said. * They said they expected the Canada dollar to continue weakening, with a move to C$1.3900 (US$0.7194) possible ahead of Canadian employment data due to be released on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think a move to C$1.3900 (US$0.7194) is likely because the Canada (dollar) still looks weak,&quot; said a trader with a Canadian bank.</p>
<p>But some analysts said they expected the Canadian dollar to begin rebounding.</p>
<p>&quot;The follow-through selling in Europe overnight was very light, and that suggests that the majority still want to buy the Canadian dollar back,&quot; said Rob Palombi, economist with MMS International.</p>
<p>&quot;The Canadian jobs data out tomorrow morning could be a perfect opportunity for them to do that,&quot; Palombi added.  </p>
<p>Overseas, the U.S. dollar took a backstage to the British pound as concerns that U.K. interest rates have peaked triggered a slump in the British currency.</p>
<p>Traders dumped pounds after the Bank of England said that interest rates were at levels consistent with Britain's inflation targets, a signal that British rates will not rise rise further.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling is back below the psychological three-mark level because the Bank (of England) has signalled that rates are on hold for now,&quot; said Nick Stamencovic, economist at DKB International.  </p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canadian dollar dipped to 85.12 Japanese yen from Wednesday's 85.63 yen and fell to 1.3520 marks from Wednesday's 1.3563 marks.</p>
