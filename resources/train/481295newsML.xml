<p>Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus will sign a short, 10-point Union Treaty on Wednesday which differs from the original draft, Kremlin sources said.</p>
<p>The sources told Reuters the bulk of the original 17-page draft, with its most controversial part, would form the basis of a charter of the Union, which Yeltsin and Lukashenko would only initial on Wednesday and then send for public debate.</p>
<p>The decision to sign only a short accord appears to reflect a compromise reached in last-minute bargaining.</p>
<p>Lukashenko and the more conservative part of the Russian leadership had wanted a more binding document to be signed, including the detailed section which appears to have been transferred into the charter.</p>
<p>Liberals in the Russian government opposed the original draft, saying they feared union could harm Russia's economy and make Lukashenko, who once professed an admiration for Adolf Hitler, a key player in Moscow politics.</p>
<p>The draft of the &quot;Treaty on a Union of Belarus and Russia&quot;, obtained by Reuters on Monday, provided for the two former Soviet republics to coordinate foreign, economic and defence policies but stopped short of a merger into a single state.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Yeltsin sent his Security Council secretary Ivan Rybkin to Minsk to present some changes to the text.</p>
<p>Lukashenko flew to Moscow on Tuesday night, earlier than scheduled and went into one-to-one talks with Yeltsin in the Kremlin on Wednesday morning to put the finishing touches to the accord. They later opened a formal session of the Russia-Belarus Community, formed last year. The session will be followed by a signing ceremony.</p>
