<p>Chinese tax authorities have issued a directive outlining tougher rules on collection and supervision of personal tax, the Shanghai Securities said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A circular from the State Administration of Taxation said government departments should coordinate and cooperate in the collection and supervision of personal tax.</p>
<p>Tax authorities should focus particularly on high-income earners, and major cases of tax evasion should be dealt with seriously according to the law, it said.</p>
<p>Individual tax collection and supervision institutions should be set up, it said without gaving further details.</p>
<p>Tax officials have said many people in China are failing to pay their income taxs due to lack of awareness, tax officials have said.</p>
<p>China introduced its first individual income tax law in 1980 and a 1994 revision outlines graduated tax rates of five percent to 45 percent, with the minimum taxable income set at 800 yuan a month and incomes of more than 100,000 yuan a month falling into the highest tax bracket.</p>
<p>China's personal income tax revenue rose by 43.7 percent to 5.409 billion yuan ($651.7 million) in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the year-ago period, the official newspaper said.</p>
