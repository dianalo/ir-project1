<title>SOUTH AFRICA: ABSA CUTS TO CUT FIXED HOME LOAN RATES.</title>
<headline>ABSA CUTS TO CUT FIXED HOME LOAN RATES.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Amalgamated Banks of South Africa Ltd (Absa) said on Tuesday it would cut its fixed interest rates for residential mortgage loans in excess of 100,000 rand from July 1.</p>
<p>Over a 12-month period the rate would drop from 19 percent to 18.20 percent while over a 24-month period, the rate would ease from 18.50 to 18.25 percent, Absa's mortgage loans general manager Richard Gahagan said in a statement.</p>
<p>The banking group also said a new 18-month fixed rate term period would be introduced with a mortgage rate of 17.60 percent -- 2.4 perecent lower than the prevailing home loan base rate. </p>
<p>It said the decision to reduce the rates had been taken in the light of Absa forseeing a reduction in interest rates in the short to medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;The introduction of these lower fixed rates will appeal to those home owners who are concerned that interest rates may rise and therefore wish to fix their monthly mortgage payment,&quot; Gahagan added.</p>
<p>Absa's move follow on the footsteps of Standard Bank which also announced a cut in its fixed and capped home loan rates last Friday.</p>
