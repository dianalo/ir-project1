<title>HONG KONG: Asia to underpin derivative growth - Hong Kong SFC.</title>

<p>While no Asian derivatives market apart from Japan can rival western peers for depth or liquidity, Asian corporates are likely to underpin regional growth, the head of Hong Kong's regulatory body said on Monday.</p>
<p>More corporate and banking institutions were now looking to hedge risk or create exposures in Asian markets, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) chairman Anthony Neoh told a conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Though no market in Asia outside Japan can yet offer the same overall level of derivatives market depth and liquidity found in the U.S., U.K. and Germany, this is changing rapidly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Asian corporates, in particular, are likely to be a major driver of derivatives market growth.&quot;</p>
<p>Neoh said further reforms were needed in some Asian countries to allow the industry to continue to develop.</p>
<p>They included further relaxation of exchange controls, provision for full currency convertibility and the abolition of onerous withholding taxes in some jurisdictions, he said.</p>
<p>They also included provision of greater legal certainty and regulatory consistency for derivatives transactions and continued progress on opening financial markets to foreign participants, he said.</p>
<p>Asia's rapid pace of financial liberalisation would continue to open up new opportunities, said Neoh, who also called on regulators to think globally in regulating risk.</p>
<p>&quot;The lines of distinction between international and local market participants -- and indeed between international and local marketplaces -- are becoming increasingly blurred,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The largest market participants in each of our national markets are now fully global institutions -- and our approach to regulating the risk borne by these institutions must also be global.&quot;</p>
<p>Neoh predicted consolidation in the markets, with a number of major investment houses and commercial banks becoming increasingly prominent.</p>
<p>Regulators would have a smaller number of institutional players to deal with and the players would be better equipped in terms of technological and systems expertise to control their own risks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet the increasing geographical reach and scope of their businesses will force, and already is forcing, the hands of regulators in at least one respect -- making international cooperation for supervisory and enforcement purposes an absolute necessity,&quot; he said. Neoh said over-the-counter derivatives volumes worldwide in notional amounts now stood at about US$40 trillion, having grown at an annualised rate of 75 percent since 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;Derivatives are not the the cause of disasters -- lack of controls are -- but rather provide substantial benefits to market participants and the economy as a whole,&quot; Neoh said.</p>
<p>&quot;A regulator must perform a balancing act between promoting soundness and stifling markets.&quot;</p>
