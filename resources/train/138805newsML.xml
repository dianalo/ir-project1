<p>Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who has dominated the Scandinavian country's politics for the past 15 years, announced on Wednesday she would resign on Friday.</p>
<p>Brundtland, 57, in a carefully-managed hand-over of power, said in a statement that Labour Party leader Thorbjoern Jagland would succeed her as prime minister.</p>
<p>Brundtland, known internationally for her strong-minded views, said it was time to make clear &quot;who would be at the helm of a Norwegian Labour government beyond this parliamentary election (in November 1997) and possibly into the next century.&quot;</p>
<p>Brundtland had  already said she wanted to step down after dominating Norwegian politics since 1981. But the timing was a surprise as an announcement was expected at the November convention.</p>
<p>Brundtland has taken a mauling in the traditionally sympathetic Norwegian press in recent months.</p>
<p>She was prime minister for eight months in 1981 and again from 1986 to 1989 and again from 1990 until now -- a total of almost 12 years in office which saw the once-powerful Conservative Party almost wiped off the political map.</p>
<p>A half-page cartoon in the best-selling daily Dagbladet last week depicted the stocky prime minister as a bloated monarch surrounded by tired courtiers paying little or no attention to any of her announcements.</p>
<p>Brundtland, who leads a minority government, told parliament she would submit her resignation to the king.</p>
<p>&quot;We are heading for a new parliamentary election and a new four-year legislature,&quot; she told parliament. &quot;I feel it is proper that the government's leadership and set-up be clarified well ahead of the election.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In light of this background I have told the king that I will submit my resignation in a cabinet session on Friday,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>There has also been speculation that Brundtland may resign well before general elections in September 1997 to seek an office at the United Nations or another internaitonal body.</p>
<p>&quot;She will be succeeded as head of the Norwegian Labour government by the incumbent leader of the Norwegian Labour Party, Mr Thorbjoern Jagland,&quot; a statement from the prime minister's office said.</p>
