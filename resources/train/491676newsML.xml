<p>Revenue Properties Company Ltd said on Monday its Pan Pacific Development unit agreed to buy a San Jose, California mall for about C$35.4 million (US$25.5 million).</p>
<p>Closing of the deal was expected to take place on or before April 25, 1997, the company said.  </p>
<p>The Monterey Plaza Shopping Centre is a 235,000 square foot shopping mall of which an anchor tenant, Lucky Food Market, owns a 52,000 square foot store.</p>
<p>Revenue Properties said a previously announced transaction between Pan Pacific and Pacific Real Estate Investment Trust, the owner of Monterey Plaza, whereby each was to contribute certain assets to a new entity, will not proceed as certain conditions of the transaction were not met.  </p>
<p>&quot;There were just a number of conditions that weren't met and time was moving on. We just felt it was in the best interests of everybody to not move forward with the merger but to go forward with an acquisiton,&quot; Russell Tanz, president and co-chief executive of Revenue Properties told Reuters.</p>
<p>Tanz said Revenue Properties was not interested in attempting to revive the failed merger agreement but would continue to pursue an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still aggressively going out there and acquiring, mainly in the west coast of the United States. That's where we are focusing and we are going to continue our acquisition plan,&quot; said Tanz.</p>
<p>Revenue Properties in February announced its Pan Pacific unit completed the purchase of Chico Crossroads Center in Chico, California for about C$28 million.</p>
