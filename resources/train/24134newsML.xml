<title>SURINAM: Ex-head of Surinam predicts victory for his party.</title>
<headline>Ex-head of Surinam predicts victory for his party.</headline>
<dateline>PARAMARIBO, Surinam 1996-08-30</dateline>

<p>The leader of Surinam's former military government, Desi Bouterse, predicted on Friday his party would form the next government.</p>
<p>Bouterse spoke after the defection of a government coalition party six days before voting to choose a new president of the South American country.</p>
<p>&quot;Justice has been done, because we are now the biggest party,&quot; Bouterse told a news conference after the Indonesian Party for National Unity and Solidarity (KTPI) announced it had left the government New Front coalition to join his National Democratic Party (NDP).</p>
<p>It was the second major defection from the New Front since May 23 national elections, and it left President Ronald Venetiaan's bid for re-election in serious doubt.</p>
<p>Venetiaan faces Jules Wijdenbosch, right-hand man to Bouterse during the military government of the 1980s, in a Sept. 5 vote of the 869-member United Peoples Assembly.</p>
<p>The latest jockeying leaves the two main political forces evenly matched. A simple majority in the people's assembly, which includes national, regional and district councilors, is enough to claim the presidency and form a government.</p>
<p>KTPI Chairman Robby Dragman said his party had agreed to join the NDP on condition that Bouterse hold no public office and human rights abuses committed during his regime be investigated.</p>
<p>Bouterse, 50, is widely held responsible for the December 1982 torture-murder of 15 opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Bouterse said on Friday he did not mind remaining behind the scenes but said any investigation of human rights abuses must also look at events leading up to the 1982 killings.</p>
<p>The walkout of the KTPI, representing descendants of 19th-century Javanese indentured labourers, meant that even if Venetiaan won Thursday's vote, he would not have a majority in the National Assembly, where the New Front now controls only 22 of the 51 seats.</p>
<p>Surinam, a former Dutch colony of 400,000 people on the northern coast of South America, has seen two military coups, seven years of military government and widespread guerrilla activity in the last two decades.</p>
