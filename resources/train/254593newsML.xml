<p>Bulgaria posted a capital account suplus of $58.6 million for the first nine month of this year after a $325.2 million deficit for the same period of 1995, Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) preliminary figures showed.</p>
<p>Portfolio investments' net change for the first nine months was $183.8 million as liabilities to foreign lenders decreased by $116.7 million, mainly due to maturity payments on Bulbank's Eurobonds, and the country's assets abroad rose by $67.1 million, the BNB said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bulgaria received $259.1 million payments on long-term loans to other countries in the first nine months, figures showed.</p>
<p>Commercial banks' deposits abroad fell by $90.7 million from January through September against a $63.3 million fall for the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Resident capital outflow continued in the third quarter due to low confidence in Bulgaria's shaky banking system, the BNB said. Private companies and individuals have withdrawn some $622 million from local banks during the first nine months, figures showed. @</p>
<p>Principal payments on long-term and short-term loans from foreigh lenders totalled $301.4 million in the first nine months, up $62.9 million year-on-year.</p>
