<p>Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees in camps in eastern Zaire could face serious food shortages as a result of their refusal to take part in a census, The U.N. World Food Programme said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Donor countries are warning that they will not fund further food supplies to the camps until an accurate count of the refugees has been carried out,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Roughly 750,000 Rwandan refugees in Goma, eastern Zaire, could face a serious food shortage owing to the impasse over the issue of a census in the camps.&quot;</p>
<p>Aid agencies say they need a head count to enable food requirements to be calculated accurately. However the census was called off on Monday after refugees refused to take part.</p>
<p>Many of the refugees were reported to have said they feared indelible ink used on them for registration might make them sterile or help to identify them if they went home.</p>
<p>The Rome-based agency said it was urgently advising refugees and their leaders to allow the count to take place.</p>
<p>It said a successful head count had been carried out in July and August among some 300,000 refugees in Bukavu, eastern Zaire.</p>
