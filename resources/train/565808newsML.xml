<title>RUSSIA: Export agent understands Russia PGM decree signed.</title>

<p>Russia's platinum group metals (PGM) export agent, Almazjuvelirexport, said on Wednesday that it believed a long-delayed Russian government decree outlining 1997 PGM exports had been signed.</p>
<p>&quot;The decree has already been signed by the government,&quot; deputy director of the agency told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It happened in the last few days, although we have not yet received a copy of the decree,&quot; he said, adding that he could not therefore fully confirm that the decree had been signed.  </p>
<p>Sergei Gorny also said that the signing of the decree should allow talks between Russia and Japan over 1997 deliveries of PGMs to start soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it will be long (before talks with Japan resume),&quot; Gorny said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to put a date on it, because you know how markets move on that kind of news. But if the decree is signed then the normal process will start quickly enough.&quot;  </p>
<p>Talks between Japan, the world's biggest palladium consumer, and Russia, the world's biggest palladium producer, have been held up by Moscow's failure to pass a decree setting out PGM export quotas this year.</p>
<p>Contract talks are usually held in December for deliveries to begin in the next calendar year. Palladium prices have soared in reaction to the delays.</p>
<p>Gorny said that the delays were the result of government and cabinet changes earlier in the year, and of protracted wrangling over the 1997 federal budget.</p>
<p>He said it was unlikely export delays were connected with a struggle for control over Russia's secretive precious metals and stones market.</p>
<p>&quot;Traditionally Almaz has been the export agent for platinum and palladium for the government,&quot; Gorny said. &quot;If there had been talks to the contrary, then presumably we would have known about them.&quot;</p>
<p>Some Japanese traders had said it appeared that Russia's central bank was trying to win a slice of the PGM export business, holding talks with Japanese trade houses on the matter last month.</p>
<p>Central bank, Finance Ministry, and now Almazjuvelirexport officials have all said they were unaware of the talks.</p>
<p>Gorny said that he was not aware of 1997 PGM quota volumes.</p>
<p>&quot;I simply do not know. The size of the quotas are secret.&quot;</p>
