<title>SOUTH AFRICA: SAfrica stocks end flat but heavyweights in demand.</title>
<headline>SAfrica stocks end flat but heavyweights in demand.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG</dateline>
<text>
<p>Great demand for heavyweight stocks characterised trade on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Tuesday with the top 10 trades all heavyweights and making up nearly half of the day's overall 1.3 billion rand turnover, dealers said.</p>
<p>Big trades included Gencor, Sasol, Anglo, SA Breweries and De Beers.</p>
<p>Gencor drew much interest from the start of trade on the back of a successful London listing for its metal arm Billiton BLT.L earlier. Gencor saw 71 million rands worth of shares change hands and finished 20 cents up at 19.20 rand.</p>
<p>Dealers said other heavyweight stocks probably drew investors because of the weaker rand which made rand hedge shares attractive. But heavyweights did not close much up and dealers said this was due to good two-way trade.</p>
<p>Richemont ended steady at 70.50 rand in turnover of 56 million rand and Remgro added 30 cents to 45.50 rand with 52 million rands worth of shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Sasol closed flat at 59 rand with shares worth 66 million rand trading, Anglo added 100 cents to 260 rand with 63 million rands of shares traded and SA Breweries cut 75 cents to 140.25 rand with 58 million rand traded.</p>
<p>The all-share and industrial index finished flat. Industrials closed 5.2 points up at 8,984.9 points and the all-share index dipped 1.7 points to 7,430.</p>
<p>Golds were a bit fragile on the bullion price which spent much of the day struggling to escape a tight $325-$326 an ounce range. The gold index closed 15 points off at 993.2.</p>
<p>Dealers said local interest was distinctly lacking and not much futures-related trade occurred. They said earlier that there were not the right margins for basket-trading and arbitrage.</p>
<p>Overall the market was hesitant ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's congress address later.</p>
<p>But dealers said the general feeling was that Greenspan would indicate that U.S. interest rates would remain unchanged for now. Should Wall Street be cheered by that and finish firmer overnight, local stocks could take the cue and move up on Wednesday, although most eyes were on local economic indicators like June trade data which is scheduled for later in the week.</p>
<p>Dealers said that on Wednesday local shares were likely to start neutral to slightly firmer.</p>
