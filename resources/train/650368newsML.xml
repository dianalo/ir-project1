<p>Some 1,000 demonstrators opposed to Greece joining the European Union's Schengen pact on open borders vowed on Tuesday to spend the night outside parliament, which will vote on the issue on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will spend the night praying. All Greek deputies must vote down this shameful pact,&quot; said Father Nikiforos, an Orthodox priest.</p>
<p>The protesters, mostly priests, nuns and members of religious groups, marched to parliament carrying crosses and icons and yelling religious slogans against Schengen.</p>
<p>The agreement, named after the Luxembourg town in which it was signed, provides for the removal of border controls between EU member states and for increased cooperation in police work.</p>
<p>&quot;The Schengen pact will be adopted on Wednesday,&quot; a parliamentary official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the ruling Socialists and the main opposition conservatives back it. We expect some leaks but it will pass without problems,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Police used teargas on Monday night to disperse a similar group of protesters when they tried to push their way into parliament as the pact was being debated.</p>
<p>Two people were arrested but there were no injuries, police said.</p>
<p>The protesters, which also include members of leftist parties, claim the pact will turn Europe into a giant police state with citizens' personal data available to authorities through a computer network.</p>
<p>Religious groups claim that identity cards to be issued to EU citizens as provided by the pact carry the number 666 in their bar code, the sign of Satan.</p>
<p>A number of countries, including Greece, have passed laws governing limits on the type of information the state can hold on citizens, but debate continues on whether Schengen threatens privacy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Schengen agreement will go into effect when the necessary preconditions securing the privacy of Greek citizens are satisfied,&quot; government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters.</p>
<p>France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal and Germany are all full Schengen members. Greece, Austria, Italy, Denmark, Finland and Sweden have signed but not yet fully implemented the pact.</p>
