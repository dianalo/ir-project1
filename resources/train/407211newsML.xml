<p>Colombia on Thursday rejected a mediating role by Venezuela in seeking the release of 70 soldiers and marines held prisoner by leftist guerrillas.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) invited Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera to mediate an end to the standoff in a letter made public on Wednesday. Venezuela replied that it was up to the Colombian government to decide.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Samper's office said in a statement that the FARC was using the captives for political leverage and said the Red Cross was in charge of mediation efforts.</p>
<p>The FARC, Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla force, captured 60 soldiers during an attack on a jungle base in the south of the country six months ago. In January, it seized 10 marines in an ambush in north-western Choco province.</p>
<p>&quot;President Samper has phoned President Caldera thanking him for his goodwill and asking that any international efforts are channelled through the international Red Cross,&quot; the Colombian statement said.</p>
<p>In its letter to Caldera, dated Jan. 22, the FARC said the soldiers would be freed if the Colombian government withdrew the army from areas in the south of the country. Samper ordered the demilitarization of a large swathe of jungle in southern Caqueta province in December in a failed bid to coax the FARC to release their captives.</p>
