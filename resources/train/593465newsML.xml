<p>Indonesia's election campaign has heated up as polling day approaches, but growing displays of dissent against the government are unlikely to threaten the ruling Golkar party, political analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The country's once-in-five-years general election, the only time when political activity is allowed, is usually a ritual affair that ends with President Suharto's Golkar party being easily voted back to power.</p>
<p>But tens of thousands of anti-government partisans have crowded the streets of Jakarta and other towns in the run-up to the May 29 election, reflecting disillusionment on a scale not seen previously, analysts said.</p>
<p>Nominally, the crowds are expressing support for the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP), one of two minority parties allowed to contest elections against Golkar, but they seem more driven by opposing the government than backing any group, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a strong anti-government tone in the campaign,&quot; said independent analyst Arief Budiman. &quot;Five years ago, it was still all right. Now, there is a high degree of intolerance, and it's anti-government.&quot;</p>
<p>The crowds on the streets have grown steadily as the campaign, which ends on May 23, reaches its climax. There have been sporadic clashes between PPP supporters and security forces and Golkar cadres, also unusual in the Indonesian context.</p>
<p>The third party in the contest, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), is likely to be routed after its rupture last year when party chief Megawati Sukarnoputri was ousted by a government-backed faction.</p>
<p>Most loyalists of Megawati, the daughter of late founding president Sukarno, are now appearing in PPP colours, and analysts have said the country could be seeing the beginning of a two-party system.</p>
<p>Political scientist Juwono Sudarsono, deputy governor of the government's National Resilience Institute, said much of the dissent sprang from the economic development in Indonesia during Suharto's three decades in power.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a form of protest and defiance against established authority and it's a reflection of the burden of success that the government has sustained over the past 30 years,&quot; Sudarsono said.</p>
<p>&quot;Longevity brings its price in terms of general acceptance. It's a temporary catharsis on the part of the youth in general who are bored with the political system, who feel that it is not open enough to allow them some degree of symbolic participation in the political process.&quot;</p>
<p>But both Budiman and Sudarsono said the result of the election was not in doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the campaign has nothing to do with the result,&quot; Budiman said. &quot;Golkar's traditional voters are basically those people who are afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;Outside the big cities, people vote for Golkar not because of the excitement of the campaign or because they are impressed by the campaign but because they don't want to have problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Sudarsono said the dissent was a &quot;temporary phenomenon&quot; that had more to do with the campaign than the actual voting.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the voting will generally be in favour of Golkar because most people seem to think that there is no viable alternative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So although they are tired of it because it's been in power for 30 years, in the end they will resign themselves to the fact that none of the other two parties can present themselves as a real viable alternative to sustain and carry on the development programme.&quot;</p>
<p>Golkar is seeking to push its share of the vote from the 125 million electorate over 70 percent from the 68 percent it won at the last polls in 1992. The PPP won 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent.</p>
