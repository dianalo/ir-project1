<title>UK: British watchdog unhinged over plastic portal.</title>

<p>A brown plastic front door at the centre of a two-year, 80,000 pounds ($132,000) legal battle will be allowed to remain at a house in a northern English village.</p>
<p>Britain's state-funded architectural watchdog body, English Heritage, argued that the polymer portal was unsuitable in a conservation area and could set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>But its arguments as framed were rejected by Britain's High Court on Tuesday and the door on the modest three-storey house in the village of Wirksworth, 200 miles (320 kms) north of London, will not be unhinged.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very disappointed but are glad that the issue has had a public airing,&quot; an English Heritage spokeswoman said on Wednesday. &quot;We hope that the ruling doesn't set a precedent.&quot;</p>
<p>The door's owner, Patricia Harman, 53, said English Heritage had so far spent 80,000 pounds -- about twice the value of her home -- trying to have her mock-Georgian door in simulated mahogany removed.</p>
<p>&quot;Stand on the other side of the street and you would not take a blind bit of notice of it,&quot; she told reporters after the ruling. &quot;It was two years after I put it in before anyone noticed.&quot;</p>
<p>English Heritage argued that the door threatened the architectural fabric of the village and has not yet given up the fight to have it replaced with a wooden variety. &quot;We are taking legal advice about a possible appeal,&quot; its spokesman said. ($1=.6072 Pound)</p>
