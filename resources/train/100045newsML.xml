<headline>U S WEST expects to complete Continental deal.</headline>
<dateline>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. 1996-10-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>U S WEST Media Group said Monday it expects to complete its $5.3 billion acquisition of Continental Cablevision Inc. by the end of November after the companies resolve certain financial issues.</p>
<p>The company said the two firms, which originally announced the deal in February, agreed that each share of U S WEST Media Group stock to be used in the transaction will be valued at $21. The deal remains the same in all other respects.</p>
<p>There had been questions about the deal going through after U S West Media Group's stock lost some 30 percent in value, dropping to $16.875 by last Friday. The shares added 75 cents Monday to trade at $17.625.</p>
<p>The companies said setting a fixed price for the U S WEST Media Group shares recognised two important things.</p>
<p>First, they said, even though cable company stocks have been trading lower since the deal was announced, the relative value of the two companies has not changed.</p>
<p>Second, both companies are committed to creating networks that can deliver customised packages of interactive entertainment, communications and information services, and are eager to work together to deploy them, they added.</p>
<p>Continental Chairman Amos Hostetter Jr. said his privately held company agreed to proceed with the transaction based on the $21 price for U S West Media Group shares because the combination made sound business sense and because Continental believed the stock was undervalued.</p>
<p>&quot;This merger is clearly the right thing for our business and now is the time to do it,&quot; Hostetter said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The combined resources of Media Group and Continental will create a powerhouse in the emerging communications, entertainment and information markets. We're prepared to proceed with the $21 price because, in our view, the stock is currently undervalued by the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the initial merger agreement, the transaction was based on a U S WEST Media Group share price of between $20.88 and $28.18.</p>
<p>The $5.3 billion equity portion of the agreement calls for consideration of $1 billion in U S WEST preferred stock, convertible to Media Group common stock; and, at U S WEST's option, between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in cash, and $2.8 billion to $3.3 billion in shares of U S WEST Media Group common.</p>
<p>With the price fixed at $21, this means between 133 million and 157 million shares will be used. As of the end of the second quarter, Media Group had 474 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The convertible securities also will be priced based on a $21 value for U S WEST Media Group common.</p>
<p>In addition to agreeing on financial terms, the two companies said they had received approval for the deal from franchise authorities representing more than 90 percent of Continental's customers and expect to receive additional approvals before closing.</p>
<p>The companies also said they were optimistic they will receive required Federal Communications Commission and U.S. Department of Justice approvals.</p>
<p>Continental Cablevision serves more than 4.2 million customers in 20 states and is part owner of companies providing cable television service in Argentina and Singapore and communication services in Australia.</p>
<p>U S WEST Media Group is one of two major units of U S WEST, a former &quot;Baby Bell&quot; regional telephone company based in Englewood, Colo. It provides domestic and international cable and telephone, wireless communications, and directory and information services.</p>
