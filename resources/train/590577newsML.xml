<p>Germany's plan to prop up its sagging state finances by revaluing gold reserves has revived Italy's chances of joining Europe's single currency club at its launch in 1999, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>German policy-makers have made no secret of their hostility to Italy -- with its long history of resorting to deficit financing -- being allowed to join European economic and monetary union (EMU) at the planned start in January 1999.</p>
<p>But Germany's gold revaluation plan, which would help it plug an 18 billion mark ($10.5 billion) forecast shortfall in tax revenues this year, has thrown into relief Bonn's own mounting difficulties in meeting stiff criteria for EMU membership.</p>
<p>Italian leaders, often accused of massaging state finances in a desperate bid to get them into shape for the EMU launch, could barely disguise their glee at Germany's predicament as it too faced charges of &quot;cooking the books&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have thought the Italian government must be clapping their hands. I certainly would be if I were (Prime Minister) Romano Prodi,&quot; said Darren Williams, an economist with UBS in London.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini lost no time in warning Germany its gold plan might destabilise the euro, turning the tables on German critics who have said EMU would only be safe if Italy was frozen out.</p>
<p>Dini was humiliated as prime minister in 1995 when German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Italy was unready for EMU's first wave.</p>
<p>&quot;By doing this (revaluing gold), Germany could put in jeopardy the healthy functioning of European monetary union,&quot; Dini told Friday's International Herald Tribune newspaper.</p>
<p>North of the Alps, Italy's chances of signing up for EMU in 1999 are widely believed to have receded in recent months.</p>
<p>Italy is on course to bring down its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, a target laid down for all would-be members of EMU.</p>
<p>But the EU executive commission in Brussels has warned Rome that the deficit will blow out again to 3.9 percent in 1998 unless tough corrective action is taken promptly.</p>
<p>It has also called on the government to replace one-off budgetary measures -- including an unpopular &quot;Eurotax&quot; -- with structural measures which have a &quot;permanent impact on the budget&quot;. Now Germany is thinking of one-off fixes of its own.</p>
<p>&quot;This option of keeping the Italians out of the currency union at the start seems increasingly less probable now,&quot; said Giovanna Mossetti, an economist with Milan finance house Caboto.</p>
<p>With France and Germany struggling to contain deficits -- aggravated by slow economic growth -- Italy is now in a better position to keep its hopes alive until the European Union decides who the EMU &quot;ins&quot; and &quot;outs&quot; are early next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Germany is having to resort to one-off measures, for its own reasons, will put Italy in a stronger bargaining position,&quot; said Lorenzo Stanca, chief economist at Credito Italiano in Milan.</p>
<p>But Italy would be wise not to crow too loudly at Germany's woes, commentators say.</p>
<p>If Italy's chances of joining the first group of EMU members have been given a boost by Germany's gold plan, the risk may also have increased of a delay in the single currency's launch.</p>
<p>&quot;This development keeps open the possibility both of the best-case scenario for Italy and of the worst -- which is what an overall delay in EMU would mean,&quot; said Mossetti.</p>
