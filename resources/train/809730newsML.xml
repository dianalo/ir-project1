<p>Federal regulators are   expected on</p>
<p>Tuesday to reject Ameritech Corp.'s bid to become the first Baby Bell to enter the $80 billion long-distance phone business, government officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based carrier wants to offer long-distance  dialing from its own calling region and has sought permission to provide the service to residents in Michigan.</p>
<p>But the Federal Communications Commission is set to conclude that Ameritech has not yet fully opened its local network in the state to new competitors -- such as long-distance carriers -- wanting to offer their own brand of local calling, the officials said.</p>
<p>Under last year's communications law, a regional Bell can offer long-distance dialing to local customers once it proves it has opened its local market to rivals.</p>
<p>Still, the expected FCC rejection should in the longer run prove valuable to Ameritech and its Bell rivals by offering a detailed road map on how to win FCC approval, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all about defining the goal posts for Bell entry. The whole process right now is extremely unclear,&quot; said analyst Scott Cleland of Legg Mason Precursor Group, the research arm of the Baltimore-based brokerage.</p>
<p>In June, the FCC rejected SBC Communications Inc.'s application to offer long-distance service in Oklahoma, saying the San Antonio, Texas-based Baby Bell had failed to meet the requirements of the 1996 telecommunications act.</p>
<p>But the FCC offered little guidance on what steps the Bells must take to pass regulatory muster, largely because the agency did not view SBC's application as a serious effort.</p>
<p>The Ameritech decision comes after FCC Chairman Reed Hundt last week complained that the landmark communications law was not working and that Congress should amend it to pry open the $100 billion local phone service market to competition.</p>
<p>Hundt noted that long-distance carriers and other new entrants to the local phone business have grabbed just 1 percent to 2 percent of the total market.</p>
<p>Ameritech was the first Bell at the start of the year to ask the FCC for permission to offer long-distance service. But the carrier was forced to yank its initial application because it was riddled with errors.</p>
<p>Ameritech has about 3.5 million customers in Michigan. The carrier values the long-distance market in its five-state territory in the Midwest at about $9 billion a year.</p>
