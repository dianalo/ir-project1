<p>Five Roman Catholic missionaries including three Australian nuns, held by rebels for nearly two weeks, arrived in the Kenyan capital from southern Sudan on Friday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The five declined to talk to reporters but church officials said a statement would be issued later on Friday. They included an American and an Italian priest.</p>
<p>The five were part of a group of six who included a Sudanese priest. He chose to remain behind, his colleagues said.</p>
<p>The six missionaries were released by Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) rebels on Wednesday night at a mission compound in the remote village of Mapourdit in southern Sudan.</p>
<p>A local SPLA commander and his men surrounded the mission and detained the three Australian nuns, an American priest, an Italian brother and a Sudanese priest on August 17. The Mapourdit mission was then looted.</p>
<p>In a statement issued in Nairobi, the SPLA apologised for the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;The SPLA hereby assures the international community that such incidents will not occur again in the future. We deeply regret the unfortunate incident,&quot; the statement said.</p>
