<title>USA: Yiddish booster Leo Rosten dies.</title>
<headline>Yiddish booster Leo Rosten dies.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Author Leo Rosten, who helped make words like klutz, kibitz and chutzpah part of everyday American English with his bestselling book &quot;The Joys of Yiddish,&quot; died on Wednesday at his New York home aged 88, friends said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rosten was best known for that bestseller and for a series of novels on Jewish immigrant life that began with &quot;The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N&quot; in 1939.</p>
<p>Kaplan was an immigrant who butchered English in a night school class where he insisted on signing his name with asterisks as he talked of such great American writers as &quot;Jeck Laundon, Valt Viterman and Mocktvain&quot; and made such observations as, &quot;If your eye should fall on a bargain, pick it up.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosten was born in Poland and emigrated to Chicago with his family when he was three years old. Educated at the University of Chicago, he found himself teaching immigrants in a night school class and was inspired by the experience to create the Kaplan books after one of his students.</p>
<p>His &quot;The Joys of Yiddish&quot; is considered the classic text explaining the language of East Europe's Jews to Americans.</p>
