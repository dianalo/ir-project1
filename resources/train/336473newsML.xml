<title>GERMANY: Bunds seen at risk of edging lower.</title>
<headline>Bunds seen at risk of edging lower.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>German Bunds were slightly firmer on Monday but dealers saw the market capped by technical resistance and said Bunds could drift lower in what was likely to be a session of rangebound trading.</p>
<p>March Bund futures were quoted up six basis points at 101.25 at 0844 GMT after having traded in a range of 101.17 to 101.29 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>One dealer predicted the contract would drift down to test resistance around 101.05/101.11 as sentiment was hit by a decline in U.S. Treasuries on Friday which continued in nervous Tokyo trade on Monday.  </p>
<p>Bunds had already fallen sharply on Friday as hopes for a near-term cut in German interest rates were dashed by news of a rise in inflation in January and by remarks from Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, who said monetary policy would remain unchanged in the near term.</p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark, six percent January 2007 bond was 5.78 percent at 0845 GMT. The Bundesbank today said that bond will be topped up by up to 10 billion marks this week in an auction with bids due by Tuesday at 1000 GMT.</p>
<p>But the market already knew about the fresh supply and the announcement had no negative impact on prices.  </p>
<p>Inflation data released by the state of Hesse on Monday had little impact on Bunds because it merely confirmed an uptick in consumer prices in January.</p>
<p>Hesse's consumer price index rose 0.4 percent month-on-month and was up 1.6 percent year-on-year, compared with rates of 0.3 percent and 1.4 percent in December.</p>
<p>Dealers have been disappointed by the inflation figures but economists say the data should not be overinterpreted as January inflation is often driven up by increases in the price of public services like bus fares.  </p>
<p>Traders see Bund futures wedged between technical support at 101.05 and resistance at 101.40 ahead of U.S. employment cost index (ECI) data due on Tuesday at 1330 GMT.</p>
