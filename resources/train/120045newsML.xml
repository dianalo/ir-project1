<p>Lithuanian newspapers carried the following reports in their Wednesday editions. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy:</p>
<p>LIETUVOS RYTAS</p>
<p>- The share holders of one of the leading commercial banks, Hermis Bank, decided to boost the capital of the bank by 25 million litas to 67 million litas. Foreign capital in the bank is 62.9 percent, private people own 19.4 percent, the government 3.6 percent and state-run companies 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>- The government plans a 596 million litas (1.7 percent of GDP) budget deficit in 1997 which is no threat to the state, said Finance Minister Algimantas Krizhinauskas. IMF agreements allow a defict equal to two percent of GDP.</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Mindaugas Stankevicius met Tuesday the ambassadors of G-24 countries and said he foresaw no big changes in the country after elections on October 20 as political forces support further reforms and only their tactics differ.</p>
<p>- The main aim of President Algirdas Brazauskas' visit to Brussels is to ensure Western countries and organisations that Lithuania wants to integrate into European security, political and economic structures and to persuade Western politicians not to push Lithuania aside from the process even for a short time.</p>
<p>RESPUBLIKA</p>
<p>- A Baltijos Tyrimai opinion poll showed the number of Lithuanians dissatisfied with the development of democracy in Lithuania has decreased to 25 percent (37.9 percent at the last elections in 1992). Only 17 percent (35.8 percent in 1992) of people believed the government can take a correct decision. The research also revealed that even 75 percent (61 percent in 1992) of adults think the majority of people are pessimistic and apathetic and do not trust in a better future. Only 25 percent (38 percent in 1992) of people think that others still believe in a better future.</p>
<p>LIETUVOS AIDAS</p>
<p>- Six parties which are hoping to beat the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party in the elections -- the Homeland Union (Conservatives), Christian Democratic Party, Democratic Party, Nationalist Party, the Union of Political prisoners and Deportees and the Liberal Union  -- signed a document encouraging people actively to vote for the right and right-of-centre political parties. They promised to seek &quot;joint constructive work in parliament&quot;.</p>
