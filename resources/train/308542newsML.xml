<title>BRAZIL: Lower interest costs cut Brazil operating deficit.</title>

<p>A slight improvement in the Brazilian government's operational deficit reflects significantly lower interest payments despite a rise in the Treasury's debt stock, the head of the Treasury said.</p>
<p>&quot;The better result basically reflects lower expenditure on interest,&quot; National Treasury secretary Eduardo Guimaraes said.</p>
<p>Brazil's federal government posted a 1.27 percent of gross domestic product operational deficit in 1996 after a 1.4 percent of GDP deficit the previous year.  </p>
<p>Real interest payments in 1996 totalled 12.725 billion reais versus 14.405 billion reais in 1995, the Treasury said in a statement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the debt stock under the responsibility of the Treasury, consisting of Treasury Letters (LTNs) and Treasury Notes (NTNs), reached 114.618 billion reais by year-end 1996, up from some 93.2 billion reais in December 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;This result (better operational deficit) has been achieved because of lower interest rates, despite the fact that public debt actually increased,&quot; Guimaraes said.  </p>
<p>The Treasury's statement said real average interest costs on Treasury paper, 75.5 percent of which was placed in the market and the rest with the Central Bank, fell to 1.08 percent in December 1996 from 1.69 percent per month in December 1995.</p>
<p>At the same time, it said average maturities increased to 4.42 months by December last year compared with 2.61 months in December 1995.</p>
<p>The Central Bank was due to announce results for the whole public sector, including states, municipalities and state-run firms, sometime over the next two weeks.</p>
