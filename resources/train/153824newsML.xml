<p>The United Nations announced the appointment on Wednesday of Canada's ambassador to Washington, Raymond Chretien, as a special envoy to help resolve the crisis in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>The conflict, which has hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing ethnic fighting, threatens to plunge Zaire and neighbouring Rwanda into war.</p>
<p>Chretien, a nephew of Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, will travel to the Great Lakes region of central Africa within the next few days and remain for about a month, a spokesman for Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said. Canada is also providing a plane for his mission.</p>
<p>His task will be to consult all the parties to &quot;establish the facts relating to the present conflicts and develop urgent plans for defusing the tension and establishing a ceasefire and a process of negotiations,&quot; the U.N. spokesman said.</p>
<p>He will also explore the possible early convening of a regional conference and advise Boutros-Ghali on the size and structure of a proposed U.N. political presence in the region. This would be in consultation with the governments concerned with the mandate to be given to a U.N. special representative who is still to be appointed.</p>
<p>Chretien, 54, has been Canada's ambassador in Washington since 1994. He served as ambassador to Zaire, with joint accreditation to Rwanda, Burundi and Congo, from 1978 to 1981. He has also headed Canada's embassy in Mexico and from 1991 to 1994 was ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Fighting has been raging in eastern Zaire between Tutsis who have lived in the area since the 18th century and the Zairean army. Zaire says Tutsi troops from neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi have joined in the fighting, which is threatening to escalate into a full-scale cross-border conflict following artillery exchanges across the Zaire-Rwanda frontier and a Rwandan military sortie into Zaire.</p>
<p>The situation is complicated by the presence in eastern Zaire of hundreds of thousands of mostly Hutu refugees who fled Rwanda after the massacre of up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994. They fear retribution by the Tutsi-led government now in power in Rwanda, which regards the Hutu refugees as a potential military threat.</p>
<p>After briefing the Security Council on the escalating crisis last Friday, Boutros-Ghali said he intended to send an emergency mission to the area, to be followed by an international conference to prevent the conflict from spreading through central Africa.</p>
<p>But he said a &quot;provisional solution&quot; had to be found to end the fighting before a conference could be convened.</p>
