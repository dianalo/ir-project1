<headline>INSTANT VIEW - UK January PMI, January M0 data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-03</dateline>

<p>Following is a selection of reactions to the UK January PMI index which rose to 54.0 from 52.8, and provisional M0 money supply, which grew 7.4 percent in the year to January.</p>
<p>PHILIP SHAW, UNION PLC</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery in the overall index suggests that manufacturing output might not be that badly hit by sterling strength over the past few months.&quot;  </p>
<p>CIARAN BARR, DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL</p>
<p>&quot;It is certainly stronger than expected. The survey shows that domestic demand is picking up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Overall I think this is a strong survey that will allay fears that the manufacturing sector is going to stagnate due to the rise in the currency.&quot;  </p>
<p>SIMON SMITH, MMS INTERNATIONAL</p>
<p>&quot;This underlines the more divergent nature of the economy which is emerging this year. The survey suggests the consumer sector is still doing fairly well, and we are still seeing the manufacturing sector domestically quite dead in the water.&quot;  </p>
<p>ROB HAYWARD, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;The other side of the benefit of the strength in the pound is that it shows input prices are remaining at very low levels. That suggests that the overall inflation picture is going to remain fairly healthy over the next six months or so, even if the economy is doing reasonably well, as these numbers suggest.&quot;  </p>
<p>MICHAEL DICKS, LEHMAN BROTHERS</p>
<p>&quot;The PMI survey is somewhat surprising in terms of its strength. We have two groups surveying the same people, and it seems two weeks after the first one (the CBI survey) the firms have changed their minds. We have also had trade numbers showing weak export volume figures and the manufacturing output data from a month ago was very weak too.</p>
<p>&quot;The PMI rather flies in face of all this. Everything appears stronger -- orders are up, output is up and quantities back to October levels. As a whole it is hard to square, and since the CBI has a better record in tracking actual output, we'll put more weight on that.&quot;</p>
