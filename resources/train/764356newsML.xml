<p>IPE August gas oil was called to open between a quarter and a half a dollar higher on Tuesday on the back of Monday's stronger NYMEX heating oil and gasoline close, but any upward move would be capped by concerns of impending Iraqi crude exports, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brent crude was expected to gain a few cents on the open on the back of small gains on overnight ACCESS WTI and talk on SIMEX.</p>
<p>August gas oil settled on Monday down some 50 cents at $167.  </p>
<p>A small upward move was expected on Tuesday on the back of late Monday's gains on NYMEX gasoline where prices were boosted by tightness in prompt supplies and firm MTBE prices and in a &quot;squeeze&quot; on the August gasoline which expires on Thursday.</p>
<p>September Brent crude oil settled on Monday down some 12 cents at $18.41. Bids on the SIMEX were at $18.43 with best offer at $18.52 a barrel.  </p>
<p>Crude prices dipped on Monday on news that Iraq had submitted to the U.N. annexes to the food distribution plan, the last step before the U.N. can approve the aid scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;The upside is capped by Iraqi oil. It looks closer now and the U.N. don't seem flexible. We could see a lot in a short space of time,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council late last week ruled out moving the June 8 start date for Iraqi oil sales under the &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal, a senior U.N. official told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>This would mean the Iraqis could be attempting to sell up to $1 billion worth of crude by September 5.  </p>
