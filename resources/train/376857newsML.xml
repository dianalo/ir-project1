<title>BELGIUM: Belgian City Hotels prices bond issue.</title>
<headline>Belgian City Hotels prices bond issue.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Belgian hotels and airline group City Hotels said on Thursday that the issue price for its one billion Belgian franc five year convertible bond issue was 5,000 Belgian francs per bond with warrant.  </p>
<p>The company said in a statement that to each bond of 5,000 francs one warrant was attached. The warrant entitles the holder to subscribe to a new share with a &quot;VVPR&quot; strip at 5,000 francs.</p>
<p>The warrant can be exercised between May 1 and 20 in the years between 1998 and 2001 and between February 1 and 20 in 2002. The bonds have a coupon of 6.50 percent. The issue consists of a maximum of 200,000 bonds with warrants.</p>
<p>Subscriptions began on Thursday and will run until February 19 inclusive. Subscriptions can be closed early from February 17. Existing shareholders can subscribe at a rate of two bonds for each five shares held in the first four days of the issue.  </p>
<p>Subscriptions can be submitted to Generale Bank and Bank Degroof.</p>
<p>The issue was aimed at raising funds to develop its hotel business in the United States. &quot;Since 1993 the United States is the greatest growth area of the company's hotel activities, and in 1996 and 1997 it already booked considerable capital gains on the sale of three hotels that it acquired in 1993 and 1995,&quot; City Hotels said.</p>
<p>In the next two years City Hotels wants to invest about $100 million in the U.S. by buying existing hotels, possibly followed by renovation, and building new hotels.</p>
<p>Its hotel capacity in the United States had dropped from 1,545 rooms from 2,196 after the sale of the three hotels.</p>
