<p>Argentine Jews said on Tuesday the release of classified U.S. documents from 1945 estimating that Nazis secretly sent more than $1 billion to Argentina during the Second World War confirmed their long-held suspicions.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been vox populi for a long time that Nazi money came here to finance the Nazis and grease palms in government to let them stay,&quot; said one leader of the Jewish community, which is one of the largest in the world. He asked not to be named.</p>
<p>A secret U.S. document declassified on Monday, sent from the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires in April 1945, estimated the Nazis secretly sent more than $1 billion for investment here just a month before the Second World War ended.</p>
<p>It was released by the World Jewish Congress, whose researchers have been combing the U.S. National Archives to trace Nazi funds, with a letter from Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. dated February 1945 warning the Nazis had penetrated the Argentine economy.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish group dedicated to tracking down Nazis, obtained archives last week from the Argentine Central Bank detailing transfers from banks in Switzerland, Spain and Portugal between 1939-49.</p>
<p>Wiesenthal's Argentine agent Sergio Widder said the newly released U.S. documents supported its requests for archives.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there's even more reason to demand total transparency from the Central Bank. We've got a first pile of papers but we want more. We don't think this is all there is. There are books detailing transfers of gold bars and coins, but they don't say from whose accounts,&quot; Widder told Reuters.</p>
<p>There has long been speculation the Nazis carried gold and artwork looted from the Jews in U-boats to Argentina, stories fuelled by recent tales of sightings of the wreck of a German submarine off the Patagonian coast.</p>
<p>Argentina was neutral for most of the war, only declaring war on Germany when defeat for the Nazis looked inevitable.</p>
<p>Under Peronist President Juan Peron, an admirer of Italian fascist ruler Benito Mussolini, it became a haven for Nazi war criminals such as Hitler's confidante Martin Bormann, Auschwitz doctor Jose Mengele, Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann and Erich Priebke, recently extradited to Italy for trial.</p>
<p>Part of the speculation has it that Peron and his young wife Evita salted away money from the Nazis in Swiss banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously there was some link with the Perons because the Nazis came in while Peron was president. But we have no way of confirming that the Perons got rich on it,&quot; Widder said.</p>
<p>The Morgenthau letter described Argentina as &quot;not only a likely refuge for Nazi criminals but also ... the focal point of Nazi financial and economic activity in this hemisphere.&quot; It estimated they invested $500 million in firms, $500 million in farms, $105 million in banks and $40 million in insurance.</p>
