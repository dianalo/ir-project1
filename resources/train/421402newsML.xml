<p>Bangladesh and the Philippines on Wednesday agreed to cooperate on a wide range of issues from protecting the rights of their expatriate workers to resolving insurgencies.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed to work closely in promoting the interest and welfare of our migrant wrokers,&quot; President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines told a news conference in Dhaka after talks with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>Ramos said his country was ready to host an international conference on migration so that the countries sending workers abroad could forge a &quot;core group&quot; to pursue an early ratification of the U.N. convention on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;This is very crucial to my country, which has 3.9 million expatriate workers in 135 countries,&quot; said Ramos, who arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday on a three-day visit to Bangladesh on the second leg of his trip to South Asia and the Middle East.</p>
<p>&quot;I share the same view. They (migrant workers) are contributing to the economies of the host countries. They must enjoy their due rights,&quot; Hasina told the new conference.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has nearly two million nationals working abroad, remitting home about $1.2 billion annually.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh prime minister said she had assured the Filipino leader of her government's continued support for solution of the insurgency in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is one of six members of a committee of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) that is trying to help end the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front insurgency.</p>
<p>Hasina said she had expressed interest in cooperation between the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), of which the Philippines is a member. She did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The two leaders have agreed to reactivate existing joint committees to bolster trade and investment ties.</p>
<p>&quot;These committees should be tasked to intensify their efforts. Our bilateral trade is too modest. We need to increase it,&quot; Ramos said.</p>
<p>Ramos, leading a 120-member delegation that includes top businessmen, leaves for Pakistan on Friday.</p>
