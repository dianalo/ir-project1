<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will meet on Sunday to discuss &quot;the nitty-gritty&quot; of further implementing their interim peace deal, an Israeli official said.</p>
<p>The talks starting at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) at the Erez crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip come ahead of an announced Israeli release of all Palestinian women prisoners.</p>
<p>The two leaders were to have met last Thursday but Netanyahu postponed the talks because of a military air disaster on Tuesday in which 73 Israeli soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>Asked about the agenda, David Bar-Illan, Netanyahu's media adviser, told Reuters: &quot;They will get down to the nitty-gritty of the further implementation of the interim agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu will obviously bring up the question of reciprocity regarding items included in the 'Note for the Record' which is attached to the Hebron agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The Note for the Record reaffirms the commitment by both sides to implement their 1995 interim peace deal and outlines the responsibilities of both the Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>It was part of a U.S.-brokered Hebron accord signed last month under which Israel handed over 80 percent of the West Bank city to Palestinian control.</p>
<p>In it, the Palestinians pledged, among other things, to revise the Palestinian National Charter, which calls for the destruction of the state of Israel, and to fight terror.</p>
<p>Israel committed itself to make further troop  redeployments in the West Bank, to release Palestinian prisoners and to resume negotiations immediately on several issues including the Palestinian sea and air ports.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Friday that all Palestinian women jailed by Israel would be freed, fulfilling part of the interim agreement. He did not give a date for their release.</p>
<p>Israel holds nearly 5,000 Palestinian prisoners but only 25 of them are women, Palestinian sources said.</p>
<p>Senior Palestinian official Mahmoud Abbas said Israel told him that the women would be freed either on Monday or on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, recently appointed to lead Israel's negotiations with the Palestinians, will take part in Sunday's meeting with Arafat, Netanyahu's adviser Shai Bazak told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bazak said Netanyahu and Levy would hold preparatory talks ahead of the meeting with Arafat.</p>
