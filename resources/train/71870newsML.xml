<p>Diesel oil users throughout the European Union are paying the price of a recent escalation in Middle East tension and the higher costs of producing a new grade of &quot;greener&quot; fuel, industry sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The retail price of diesel, increasingly popular with car drivers, has risen by five percent since early August, boosted by surging crude oil -- which has leapt on fears of instability in the oil-rich Gulf -- and the increased costs to refiners of making a low-sulphur grade on sale at the pumps from next month.</p>
<p>&quot;Across the industry we've seen prices start to rise, partly as a result of the cost of product and also because people are not making enough money,&quot; said a Shell UK official.</p>
<p>Rising costs of gasoline and automotive diesel on the European spot market has forced oil companies to pass on some of the increase to customers at the pumps.</p>
<p>In Rotterdam, unleaded gasoline rose from $195 a tonne on August 1 to over $220 a tonne by mid-September. Last week it slipped back to about $200,  but the cost of gas oil -- used for heating oil and diesel -- is still over $220, up from $176 on August 1.</p>
<p>World crude prices rallied to a post-Gulf War high of $24.39 a barrel earlier this month after the United States fired cruise missiles at Iraqi targets in retaliation for Baghdad's decisive intervention in Kurdish factional fighting.</p>
<p>British consumers have felt the impact most keenly.</p>
<p>Last autumn the country's biggest retailer Esso UK sparked a price war in response to fierce competition for market share from supermarket chains.</p>
<p>&quot;It's well known that retail margins have been under considerable pressure for most of this year but since late July there have been several attempts by oil majors in the U.K. to reduce the losses their retail operations are seeing,&quot; said Robert Olle, director of consultants Oil Price Assessments Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Just this week there was a fourth attempt to raise pump prices... which has been partially successful,&quot; he said on Friday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, automotive fuel retailers have been able to absorb much of the rise in gasoline prices, which are now coming down on the spot market, but the squeeze on diesel looks set to continue and pump prices may have to rise further.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were in the retail marketing department of an oil major I would be extremely concerned about the lack of margin on diesel sales,&quot; said Olle.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be surprised if even the big supermarket operators can live with these margins for very long.&quot;</p>
<p>Sainsbury Plc, one of Britain's leading supermarket groups, said it raised forecourt prices across the board by a penny a litre on Thursday, the first such rise for several months.</p>
<p>Diesel's popularity has grown in recent years, partly because it gives drivers more kilometres per litre, and now accounts for about 20 percent of the automotive fuel market in Britain, 25 percent in Germany, nearly 30 percent in Italy and almost 50 percent in France.</p>
<p>From October 1, retailers will have to sell diesel with a sulphur content no higher than 0.05 percent. Industry sources say the new grade costs some $6-8 a tonne more to produce than the old standard 0.2 percent sulphur fuel.</p>
