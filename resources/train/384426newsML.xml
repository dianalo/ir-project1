<title>ROMANIA: Romania hikes fuel prices by over fifty percent.</title>
<headline>Romania hikes fuel prices by over fifty percent.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-02-18</dateline>

<p>Romania increased fuel prices by over 50 percent on Tuesday, to help cover losses caused by the depreciating leu and to meet conditions laid down by international lenders.</p>
<p>Petrol rose to 2,900 (41 cents) per litre of premium, up from 1,900 and disel rose to 2,400 lei (34 cents) per litre, up from 1,300.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to gradually adjust these prices, according to the leu's value against the dollar,&quot; an official from the state-run National Oil Company said.</p>
<p>The leu has fallen steadily in value over the past month. Its reference rate was 4,035 to the dollar by mid-January when energy prices were last increased. It now stands at 7,024 to the dollar after being 2,580 on January 1.</p>
<p>The price increases were also in line with conditions set by international lenders, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which completed talks this week with the government headed by Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea on new loans worth around $1.0 billion needed to prop up the economy.</p>
<p>Bringing energy prices gradually up to international market levels was part of the government's reform package, endorsed by the IMF and World Bank in exchange for the new loans.</p>
<p>Romania annually produces around 6.7 million tonnes of crude oil but needs to import about double that amount -- a huge financial burden for the cash-strapped ex-communist country -- to meet demand and keep its big refining sector running.</p>
