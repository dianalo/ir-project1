<p>French President Jacques Chirac, who caused a storm by saying Italy might not be among the first countries to join a single European currency, said on Tuesday he strongly hoped it would be.</p>
<p>Chirac told a news conference in the northern French town of Arras: &quot;I believe the Italian government is fully determined to do everything, as it has shown in its budget, to be in the first wave of countries to join the euro. I ardently hope it will succeed.&quot;  </p>
<p>Chirac triggered a diplomatic storm with Rome two days before a Franco-Italian summit, and briefly caused the lira to fall on currency markets earlier on Tuesday when he cast doubt on Italy's ability to join the first wave.</p>
<p>He had told businessmen: &quot;Things are going to go pretty quickly now, on January 1, 1999, for some countries which will have made the effort to clean up their economic and financial situation...It may take a little bit longer for those who are further behind, like Italy.&quot;</p>
<p>The president also said France's textile industry had suffered more from devaluation of the lira, the British pound and the Spanish peseta than from southeast Asian imports, adding it was &quot;quite obvious that the lira's movement is completely incompatible with a single European market, even if it has rebounded slightly recently&quot;.</p>
<p>Italian deputy prime minister Walter Veltroni said that if Chirac's statements were not denied, they would be regarded as grave interference, and Prime Minister Romano Prodi summoned the French ambassador to demand an explanation of the remarks.</p>
