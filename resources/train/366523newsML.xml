<p>The South African rand ended at its best intraday levels on Monday on the back of consistent dollar sales out of London as positive sentiment continued to buoy the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>The currency ended the day at 4.4075/4105 on the dollar from 4.4385/4415 late on Friday -- its best levels since July 24.</p>
<p>It initially gained on the release on Friday of far better than expected January gold and foreign exchange reserves figures -- the highest since March 1996 -- at 11.76 billion, up from 10.31 billion in December.</p>
<p>&quot;It was generally a quiet day with the rand not running down as aggressively,&quot; a trader at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>Others said there had been consistent dollar sales by London fund managers and they expected the unit to test the 4.40 level over the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is definitely still stronger but it was less hectic today,&quot; one trader noted.</p>
<p>The rand was seen toppish at 4.44 and there was on-going offshore buying interest.</p>
<p>One senior trader at a leading bank said: &quot;There is definitely potential to move down further and what we are seeing is perhaps a bit of a breather after sharp gains last week.&quot;  </p>
<p>On the crosses, the rand was last trading at 7.1766/1859 on sterling from 7.2175/2268 late on Friday and at 0.3760/3764 on the mark versus 0.3760/3765.</p>
<p>Long bonds ended off their best intraday levels on late profit-taking and offshore selling after a strong start which saw yields move to their lowest levels since July 11 on the positive reserves figure.</p>
<p>Other factors hoisting the market were improved money market conditions, expectations of an upbeat March 12 budget and the strong rand, bond traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market broke through some important technical levels on the downside during the day, but the general perception is that the market is overbought and we have not yet seen a proper retracement.</p>
<p>&quot;Once that is out of the way we can see more strength with 14.78 percent the next target on the bottom,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said a series of political briefings this week and Thursday's adjustment budget were being keenly awaited for possible news on exchange controls.</p>
<p>At 1415 GMT the R150 bond was at 14.91 percent from 14.96 percent late on Friday after touching an intraday best level of 14.85 percent, its best since July 11.</p>
<p>Foreigners turned sellers of South African bonds on Friday after a week of healthy buying, dumping a net 432.00 million rands worth of bonds after buying 340.83 million on Thursday, the Bond Exchange said.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative turnover was 7.08 billion rand on Friday from 49.2 billion rand on Thursday, a settlement date.</p>
<p>On the money market, three-month NCDs were quoted steady between 16.45 to 16.65 percent and the 90-day BA rate was also unchanged at between 15.80 to 16.05 percent bid.</p>
<p>South Africa's money market shortage fell to 7.851 billion rand on Saturday from 7.876 billion rand on Friday, the Reserve Bank said.</p>
