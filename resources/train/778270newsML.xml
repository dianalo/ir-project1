<p>European mogas price gains dramatically slowed down on Tuesday after Monday's $17 jump, as the first half August bid-offer range for Eurogarde barges was placed in the $234-$236 range for much of Tuesday.</p>
<p>This was just $3 up on the day and was confirmed by two deals at $236, one in the morning and the next during the afternoon - the latter for Rotterdam refinery material - and by a trade at $235 FOB AR, defying early talk of offers as high as $239.</p>
<p>Cargo bidding was meanwhile heard as high as $235-$236 in the north, althought a tight Med market saw little market activity.</p>
<p>Swap values were meanwhile $4 higher by early evening at $222-$223 for August, which was seen traded thorugh the afternoon at $222, $221.75, $221, $222.50, $223, and $223.50.</p>
<p>Two afternoon September swap trades were meanwhile seen at $203.50 on &quot;a day for reflection rather than action,&quot; according to one dealer.</p>
