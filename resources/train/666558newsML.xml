<p>Shoppers ducked for cover as bullets flew across the fruit and vegetables in a pitched battle between police marksmen and robbers in a Mexico City supermarket, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A spokesman said one policeman was killed and one wounded in the shootout, which began Monday evening when police intercepted a gang of around 10 thieves trying to rob an armoured car collecting the takings from a shopping centre in the Narvarte district of the capital.</p>
<p>The gang took shelter inside a busy supermarket, taking about 30 terrified shoppers hostage and exchanging fire with police.</p>
<p>Mothers screamed to their children to hide, police yelled at shoppers to throw themselves to the floor and the robbers trampled over the terrified men and women caught in the battle, newspaper reports said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was crazy, it was real hell,&quot; shopper Arturo Sanchez told El Universal daily. &quot;All I could hear was people screaming in desperation looking for their families.&quot;</p>
<p>Seven shoppers were injured in the gunbattle, which lasted several hours, but police said the victims were all out of danger.</p>
<p>Late Monday night, police captured one of the attackers and the others fled, leaving their hostages behind. Another three members of the gang were arrested during the night and police were still hunting the others.</p>
<p>Violent crime has soared in Mexico City, which has 18 million people, since the 1994-5 economic crisis, and armed muggings, bank robberies and shootouts take place almost daily.</p>
