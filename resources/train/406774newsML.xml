<p>Inter Milan coach Roy Hodgson, who takes over at Blackburn Rovers at the end of the season, assured the English club on Thursday that he was a man who kept his word.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not Eriksson,&quot; he told a news conference when it was pointed out to him that contracts could be broken.</p>
<p>Hodgson was approached by Blackburn after Sampdoria's Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had signed a contract with the Premier League club previously but then backed out of the agreement, saying he wanted to stay in Italy.</p>
<p>Eriksson has been linked since to Lazio, who sacked Czech coach Zdenek Zeman and are being run for the time being by president Dino Zoff as a stopgap measure.</p>
<p>Zoff has already said he will hand over to another man next season, without anyone being officially named.</p>
<p>Hodgson, the former Swiss national coach who has been at Inter for 16 months, said he had signed a contract with Blackburn last Monday after telling Inter president Massimo Moratti of his intentions on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision has been taken, I signed the contract last Monday and I will not change my decision, which is a professional one,&quot; he said, adding that Moratti had been understanding and had not tried to dissuade him.</p>
<p>Hodgson said that he was &quot;100 percent sure that Blackburn wants me. I cannot say the same for Inter. For that reason I am leaving.&quot;</p>
<p>Moratti said on Wednesday that Hodgson had been stung by criticism in Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;He's a man who suffers if he does not succeed, if he fails to have the 100 percent backing of public opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>However Hodgson said he could withstand the pressure and that was not the main reason for his departure.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unfair to say that I'm leaving Inter because of the pressure,&quot; he said. &quot;If there's anybody who has demonstrated that he can withstand unfair criticism, its me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Englishman, who joins a club at the bottom end of the Premier League, said Blackburn had made him the kind of financial offer that he could not refuse.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers have reported that Moratti wants Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello to replace Hodgson, despite the former AC Milan boss having a contract in Spain until 1999.</p>
<p>Other more likely candidates mentioned by Italian newspoapers are Udinese coach Alberto Zaccheroni, Atalanta's Emiliano Mondonico and Vicenza's Francesco Guidolin.</p>
