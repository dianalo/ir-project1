<p>Canadian bonds opened weaker in quiet trade on Friday, amid a softer U.S. Treasuries market and strong Canadian economic data, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market trades like it's going to go lower. I think it will,&quot; said Hank Cunningham, director of fixed-income with First Marathon Securities Ltd. &quot;People are very cautious here in this market after this beating. The market was overextended for sure. We're settleing back to what should be more normal levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.98 to C$118.61 to yield 6.568 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond fell 26/32 to yield 6.61 percent. The negative spread between the bonds narrowed to four basis points from six basis points on Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds opened weaker with U.S. treasuries, which softened in early trade in tandem with the U.S. dollar. Cunningham said U.S. dealers were also on the defensive after recent refundings.</p>
<p>The only major economic news out this morning was the Canadian composite leading indicator for July, which rose 0.8 percent. A Reuters survey of economists had forecast the smoothed index to rise 0.7 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The leading indicator is very strong in Canada again. This is a hot economy,&quot; said Cunningham.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was still feeling the effect of a short squeeze at the two-year portion of the curve, which became apparent on Thursday. The Government of Canada 4.0 percent bond due March 15, 1999 traded down C$0.05 to C$99.71 to yield 4.191 percent.</p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.55 to C$109.02 to yield 6.015 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. 10-year bond fell 11/32 to yield 6.30 percent.  </p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 29 basis points from 32 basis points at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The 10-year Canadian government bond futures contract trading on the Montreal Exchange fell 0.39 to 119.75 with 1870 contracts changing hands.</p>
