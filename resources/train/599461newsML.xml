<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Tuesday the country could have a national election in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;There could well be another federal election next year,&quot; he said in a speech at a business lunch.</p>
<p>The conservative Liberal-National government was elected for its first three-year term in March, 1996. The next election would ordinarily be due in early 1999.  </p>
<p>Costello later told reporters that the government's three-year term would be up by the end of 1998, but he was also unsure what impact parliament's upper house, the senate, would have.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that (1998) would be the natural timing, and of course we do not know how the senate is going to play out,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope the Senate does co-operate over the course of this year and next.&quot;</p>
<p>The government can dissolve both houses of parliament and call an early election if the senate twice blocks government legislation.  </p>
<p>The government faces senate obstruction over at least two key reforms -- a planned solution to a land rights row between farmers and Aborigines and proposed labour reforms that would make it easier for small business to sack new workers.</p>
<p>The constitution is vague about election timing.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives officially expires three years after its first sitting -- which take it to April, 1999.</p>
<p>But the election can be held several months earlier or later under a range of circumstances.  </p>
<p>Costello also said he supported four-year parliamentary terms instead of three years.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we do need four-year federal terms ... the parliamentary terms are so short these days that it does restrict many of your options,&quot; he said.</p>
