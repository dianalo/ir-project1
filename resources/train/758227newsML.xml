<p>Swiss food and beverage concern Hero AG said its operating income rose 47 percent in the first half of 1997, with the increase tied mainly to results of its beverage division.</p>
<p>It provided only the percentage change in income.</p>
<p>It also said that the increase in the operating income was as budgeted, and that it expected the second half of 1997 to be in line with budget projections as well, despite the fact that beverage sales are highly dependent on weather.</p>
<p>In a statement the company, which is majority-owned by German foods group Schwartau International GmbH, also said that its revenues in the first half were down two percent at 873 million Swiss francs ($577.8 million).</p>
<p>Hero reported in April that its 1996 group operating profit rose 26.4 percent to 88.5 million francs on sales on 1.84 billion francs, up 27.9 percent.</p>
