<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Tuesday the prospect for the nation's economy were &quot;really quite good&quot; and added that a cut in the capital gains tax would not have much beneficial impact.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the economic prospects for the country are really quite good, especially if we continue doing the kinds of things we need to do, which we did in putting in place a balanced budget agreeement,&quot; he told MSNBC television.  </p>
<p>Rubin declined to comment on current market levels.</p>
<p>Asked about the tax on capital gains, Rubin said: &quot;The question of a capital gains tax cut has always been a very controversial one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are people who believe very strongly in its benefits for the economy... There are others, and I would be amongst them, who think it's likely to have relatively little effect on the economy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rubin also said that President Bill Clinton's use of the line-item veto to strike three provisions from the balanced budget deal would stand up to any possible court challenge. &quot;We are prepared to defend it very rigorously if in fact our use of this line-item veto is challenged,&quot; he said.
