<p>New President Arnoldo Aleman on Tuesday met the former head of the Sandinista army as part of a bridge-building effort between Nicaragua's squabbling political extremes.</p>
<p>&quot;We have different ideologies, but we are sons of the same country, and now we have entered a dialogue to search for the common good and fight against poverty,&quot; Aleman told reporters after meeting with former Sandinista People's Army chief Humberto Ortega.</p>
<p>Despite the end of its civil war seven years ago, Nicaragua remains bitterly polarised between the left-wing Sandinista Front and Aleman's right-wing Liberal Alliance coalition, which took power on Jan. 10.</p>
<p>Those hostilities had led former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega, Humberto's brother, to warn of political instability if the triumphant Liberals moved against the still-powerful Sandinistas.</p>
<p>Humberto Ortega, who led the Sandinsta army for more than 16 years, said he and Aleman met to discuss how to &quot;strengthen the climate of tranquility and harmony in Nicaragua.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's important that the president is starting to talk with the Sandinista Front. This fact makes us happy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Late on Monday, Aleman met with Daniel Ortega and other top Sandinista ruling council members in a long-awaited meeting both men described as &quot;positive and productive.&quot;</p>
<p>No agreements came out of the historic meeting, but the two parties agreed to continue negotiations designed to guarantee Nicaragua's political stability.</p>
<p>The meetings have eased tensions in Nicaragua, defusing a budding crisis that had darkened Aleman's first days in office, as Sandinistas warned of street protests against what they saw as a looming Liberal dictatorship.</p>
<p>Sandinista leaders accused the Liberals of trying to dominate the government, parliament and judicial system, leaving no independent state institutions.</p>
<p>Daniel Ortega, who ruled Nicaragua from 1979-1990, still had not recognised the legitimacy of Aleman's Oct. 20 election win, saying it was fraudulent.</p>
<p>Humberto Ortega retired to private life in 1995. Although virtually all of the army's high command is still of Sandinista origin, it has withdrawn from politics since Humberto stepped down.</p>
