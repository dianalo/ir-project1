<title>USA: Monsanto earnings fall after $72 million Calgene charge.</title>
<headline>Monsanto earnings fall after $72 million Calgene charge.</headline>
<dateline>ST. LOUIS 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Monsanto Co. on Tuesday reported lower second-quarter earnings after the company took a $72 million after-tax charge for the acquisition of remaining shares of Calgene Inc. that it didn't already own.</p>
<p>After the 12 cent-per-share charge, the diversified manufacturer of agricultural, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food products, earned $324 million, or 54 cents per share, on record sales of $2.9 billion in the second quarter. In the year-ago period, profits were $365 million, or 62 cents per share, on sales of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>Chemical profits jumped to $120 million from $77 million, as sales grew 4 percent to $799 million from $769 million, largely because productivity improved across many operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Our life sciences businesses are well on track to have the financial success for the year that we and our shareowners expect. The chemical businesses are also meeting expectations, and are well positioned for the upcoming spinoff,&quot; said Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro.</p>
<p>Monsanto said the previously announced spinoff of its chemicals business is expected to take place on or before Oct. 1, pending shareholder and government approvals.</p>
<p>Monsanto said its agricultural products segment earned $322 million after the one-time charge for acquired research and development that stems from the $240 million purchase of 88 percent of Calgene's shares. Monsanto now owns 94 percent of Calgene, a biotechnology company based in Davis, Calif.</p>
<p>In the 1996 second quarter, agricultural earnings were $367 million. Agricultural sales were $1.25 billion, up from $1.04 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;In any quarter, as in this one, earnings may be somewhat affected by investments we're making for future growth,&quot; Shapiro said. &quot;We believe these acquisitions and research programmes are necessary to generate the type of long-term growth our investors expect from a leader in life sciences.&quot;</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical operating income in the second quarter fell to $9 million from $36 million a year ago, due to accelerated spending for the development and commercialization of products in the pipeline. Sales rose to $513 million from $456 million.</p>
<p>Monsanto, based in St. Louis, also said it did not receive payments from alliances, as it did in the second quarter of 1996, affecting pharmaceutical results.</p>
<p>Food ingredient earnings fell to $50 million from $52 million, while sales slid to $286 million from $312 million.</p>
<p>Reduced volumes of aspartame and tabletop sweeteners were partially offset by volume gains in biogum and by cost cuts, Monsanto said.</p>
<p>Monsanto's stock fell 31 cents to $50.50 in consolidated early afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
