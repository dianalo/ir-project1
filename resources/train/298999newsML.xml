<p>The battered credibility of Mexican prosecutors took a fresh knock on Friday when law officials admitted that a corpse touted as a key breakthrough in a political murder investigation was not all it seemed.</p>
<p>In the latest of a series of law enforcement embarrassments, the Attorney-General's office (PGR) announced the results from 23 tests on a corpse dug up amid great fanfare by prosecutors last October on a ranch used by Raul Salinas, the brother of former president Carlos Salinas.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had claimed the corpse was that of Manuel Munoz Rocha, a missing congressman who allegedly helped Raul organize the killing of a top ruling party politician in 1994.</p>
<p>Former Attorney-General Antonio Lozano, who was fired last month by President Ernesto Zedillo for incompetence, had touted the corpse as the big breakthrough prosecutors needed to secure Raul's conviction.</p>
<p>But deputy chief prosecutor Jose Luis Ramos Rivera told reporters on Friday that all the identification tests had concluded the remains were not those of Munoz Rocha.</p>
<p>&quot;The remains found on Oct. 9, 1996 ... do not correspond to (those of) Manuel Munoz Rocha,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ramos said the case against Raul Salinas would continue, but his lawyers, who had claimed all along that prosecutors planted a fake corpse on the ranch to provide evidence to convict their client, got a big boost nonetheless.</p>
<p>Friday's corpse embarrassment came hard on the heels of a series of attacks on the PGR's credibility.</p>
<p>Zedillo has made respect for the law a key plank of his administration, but his efforts to improve the dreadful image of Mexican justice have been hampered by problems at the PGR.</p>
<p>Although Lozano's firing was supposed to improve matters -- and officials on Friday were quick to point out that the corpse fiasco occurred during his tenure -- problems have hit the PGR this week under its new chief, Jorge Madrazo.</p>
<p>Leading Mexico City newspaper Reforma reported on Friday that there were serious inaccuracies in a PGR press statement this week and a judge complained of sloppy investigations.</p>
<p>The PGR claimed a big success on Monday night, saying police and soldiers had raided a top drug lord's family wedding and arrested more than 25 people.</p>
<p>But sources at the office said on Friday all but five of those arrested had been set free and none of the suspects still behind bars was of any importance in the Juarez drug cartel led by Amado Carrillo Fuentes.</p>
<p>Reforma said the Attorney-General's office had given false information about several key aspects of the raid on the wedding of Carrillo Fuentes's sister, Aurora.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the PGR wrongly claimed three airplanes used to fly guests to the wedding had been seized. It also wrongly said their pilots were arrested and it falsely alleged that the pilots had not filed flight plans, Reforma said.</p>
<p>Asked about the allegations, a PGR spokeswoman said: &quot;The press bulletin was based on the information that we had at the time. I think this is bad faith by someone.&quot; She did not deny that the information was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Newspapers earlier this week quoted residents of the town of Navolato in the northwestern state of Sinaloa where the wedding was held as saying Amado Carrillo Fuentes attended the lavish ceremony, but escaped before police arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Police were waiting to catch him there when he appeared at the wedding,&quot; commentator Miguel Angel Granados said. &quot;But a timely warning allowed the fish to slip the net.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico's war on drugs suffered another blow this week when a judge acquitted accused top cocaine lord Hector &quot;The Blonde&quot; Palma on drugs charges, saying there was insufficient evidence to convict him.</p>
<p>The PGR attacked the decision, hinting that corruption might have been behind the acquittal. But that criticism boomeranged when the judge said the main reason he could not convict was that the PGR had not supplied adequate evidence.</p>
