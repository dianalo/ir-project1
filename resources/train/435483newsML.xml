<p>Dundee United drove a wedge between Rangers and their ninth successive Scottish league title with a surprise 2-0 win at Ibrox on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The upset meant that instead of moving eight points clear of second-placed Celtic, Rangers remain five points clear at the top -- and they travel to Celtic for the Old Firm derby on Sunday.</p>
<p>Goals from Robbie Winters after 29 minutes and Kjell Olofsson two minutes into the second half meant United became the first Scottish side to defeat Rangers at home in 24 matches since January 1996 when Hearts won there 3-0.</p>
<p>The upset came just 24 hours after Celtic crashed to a surprise 2-0 defeat at Kilmarnock and should give Celtic some heart for Sunday's battle.</p>
<p>Rangers have now lost their last two matches following a draw at Aberdeen and if they do go on to equal Celtic's famous feat of nine successive titles they will do it at a stagger rather than a canter.</p>
<p>Rangers were without long-term injuries Paul Gascoigne, Sebastian Rozental and Stuart McCall and club skipper Richard Gough, who missed last week's Scottish Cup defeat by Celtic with a calf strain, was not risked. Goalkeeper Andy Goram however, played despite his rib injury and Gordon Durie returned after his injury.</p>
<p>United made one change from the side that moved into the Scottish Cup semifinals on Saturday with a 4-1 win over Motherwell, with David Bowman replacing Ray McKinnon.</p>
<p>United snatched the lead with a lightning break out of defence when Maurice Malpas released Kjell Oloffson and his pass was perfect for Winters to steer the ball beyond Goram for his 11th goal of the season.</p>
<p>Then soon after the restart another quick United break left Rangers trailing 2-0.</p>
<p>This time Winters supplied the pass and Olofsson stroked the ball home with the Rangers defence helplessly chasing back.</p>
<p>Rangers remain favourites to win the title but if they lose again on Sunday the race is wide open.</p>
