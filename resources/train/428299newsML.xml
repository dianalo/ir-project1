<p>Athens, which hosted the first Olympic Games, will be one of the final five candidate cities for the 2004 Games but although welcome, the news has been already discounted by the stock market, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Friday the International Olympic Committee (IOC) selected Athens, Rome, Cape Town, Stockholm and Buenos Aires from 11 candidates bidding for the Games.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the IOC picked the five best candidates. There now must be an intense, systematic effort on our part to make it first to the finish line,&quot; said central bank governor Lucas Papademos.</p>
<p>&quot;Our effort should focus on the weak points -- traffic, environment and the number of tourist beds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The announcement came about 50 minutes after the close of the stock market which corrected 1.23 percent after a strong rebound in the previous two sessions. There was no opportunity for an immediate reaction in the price discovery arena.</p>
<p>But brokers felt that Athens' successful first test in its quest for the 2004 Summer Games has been already discounted by the bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;The news has been pretty much discounted by the market which has looked fatigued in the last two sessions,&quot; said John Marcopoulos, managing director at Sigma Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We may see an attempt to the upside on Tuesday but it will be short-lived. I see the market consolidating around the 1200 level. It needs to digest the new valuations after the two-month rally.&quot;</p>
<p>There were no real surprises in the five chosen cities with Athens, Rome, Buenos Aires and Stockholm coming out best from the IOC's evaluation report on the technical merits of their bids.</p>
<p>Rome and Athens are expected to be the front runners even though both have staged the Games before.</p>
<p>The IOC decision is closely watched by stockbrokers, builders and airline chiefs as much as sports fans.</p>
<p>Staging an Olympics can have a major effect on a country's economy as often a new infrastructure has to be built and sponsorship deals worth millions of dollars are there to be made. Stock and currency markets can move on the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very important news and will certainly mean a lot to the stock market if it is also pleasant in September 5 when the venue will be decided,&quot; said broker Tasos Stamatopoulos at Kyklos Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the market will stage an upside reaction but momentum is looking subdued. I expect shares to consolidate gains before taking off again. We will be moving to higher ground soon.&quot; --Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
