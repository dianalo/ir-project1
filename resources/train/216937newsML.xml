<p>Chechen guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev, who took thousands of Russians hostage when he seized a hospital last year, declared on Tuesday that he plans to run for the presidency of the rebel region, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Shamil Basayev said that along with his comrades he was prepared to fight for the post of president to show by deeds his ability not only to fight, but to build a peaceful life,&quot; the agency reported.</p>
<p>It said Basayev had appeared on Chechen television.</p>
<p>The guerrilla, who forced Moscow to negotiate a ceasefire in its conflict with Chechnya's rebels by taking over the hospital in June last year, was until recently described as a terrorist in Russia, which saw him as its greatest foe.</p>
<p>Scores of people were killed during the hostage-taking at the hospital and in the ensuing six-day standoff between Basayev's guerrillas and Russian troops.</p>
<p>The tough, bearded fighter also played a leading role in a bloody assault on the Chechen capital Grozny which humiliated the Russian forces and paved the way for a peace deal to be signed in August to end the 21-month conflict, in which tens of thousands of people died.</p>
<p>Elections are now scheduled for January 27 to set up a post-war administration in the southern Russian region.</p>
<p>Tass said Basayev's election programme was focused on the fight against crime and corruption in war-torn Chechnya and the &quot;fair distribution of the national wealth&quot;.</p>
<p>Another Chechen separatist leader, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, has already said he plans to run.</p>
<p>Other candidates are likely to surface after Wednesday, the official start of the campaign.</p>
<p>Speculation centres on Chechen Prime Minister Aslan Maskhadov, who commanded the rebels' military operations against Europe's largest army.</p>
<p>In order to avoid a split in separatist ranks, Maskhadov has so far pledged his loyalty to Yandarbiyev, but he commands more respect among many Chechens and would be a much stronger candidate.</p>
<p>Moscow declared an amnesty for the rebel leaders following the August peace deal, which led to a pledge by President Boris Yeltsin last weekend to withdraw remaining troops from the region before the election.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who launched Moscow's ill-fated military campaign against Chechen separatism in December 1994, has been sharply criticised by communist-led opposition in the lower house of parliament for his plan to pull out the troops.</p>
<p>The communists have called an extraordinary parliamentary session on Friday to discuss the issue, arguing that by withdrawing the troops Yeltsin is sanctioning Chechen independence.</p>
<p>They have threatened to try to impeach Yeltsin -- a long drawn-out procedure which has little chance of success -- or to call for a no-confidence vote in the government.</p>
