<p>The International Monetary Fund halted its lending programme to Kenya on Thursday amid mounting concern that the government was not doing enough to crack down on corruption.</p>
<p>An IMF spokesman said a $205 million three-year loan, offered under the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, would be allowed to lapse because the governemnt's response to a July 24 deadline had been inadequate.</p>
<p>&quot;The management of the International Monetary Fund has examined Kenya's request for an extension of the current (loan) and considers that the measures that the government is prepared to take fall short of meeting the clearly expressed concerns of IMF member countries in the area of governance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore the ESAF arrangement will lapse today.&quot;</p>
<p>News that the IMF is not extending the loan is bound to alarm already-nervous Kenyan markets and have negative implications on other bilateral programmes of loans and aid.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the reaction is going to be pretty awful, especially on the foreign exchange market,&quot; said a New York-based emerging markets analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors will be really nervous and this could be the final straw for people who have hung in there through the recent political violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Several people were killed in rioting in Nairobi earlier this month. The Kenyan shilling fell to a mean commercial rate of 58.92 to the dollar in Nairobi on Thursday, from from 58.06 on Wednesday amid concern about what the IMF would decide.</p>
<p>The IMF, which delayed a $36 million portion of the three-year loan on June 30, had last week given the Kenyan authorities until the end of this month to &quot;take decisive steps&quot; to boost accountability and transparancy in the much-maligned public sector.</p>
<p>The deadline, issued after the loan had been extended several times, expired at the close of the working day in Washington and the IMF announcement followed soon afterwards.</p>
<p>Kenyan officials had asked the IMF to ignore the deadline to allow time for more talks and more action, and earlier on Thursday they accused the IMF of making political demands.</p>
<p>Fares Kuindwa, head of the civil service and secretary to the cabinet, told a news conference in Nairobi that Kenya was committed to reducing corruption and that issues raised by the IMF were &quot;90 percent political&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the government wanted the courts to resolve the Goldenberg scandal, under which a firm was paid $100 million under an export compensation scheme for gold and diamonds.</p>
<p>Kenya produces little gold and has no diamond deposits and the scam was one of the IMF's main areas of concern.</p>
