<p>Chilean blue chips closed sharply weaker for the second day in a row as investors cashed in gains from the bourse's New Year's surge, trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market should stabilize in the next couple of days but it will be down a notch tomorrow,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The rally has definitely snapped and we won't see the upward trend resumed easily.&quot;</p>
<p>The 40-share index ended down 2.08 percent at 108.94 points with blue chip stocks falling over five percent in the last two sessions.  </p>
<p>The general index shed 1.23 percent to 5,196.97 points amid volume of 14 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Traders blamed profit-taking by foreign investors and concern over the impact of recent Central Bank exchange rate measures for the abrupt correction in Chilean stock prices.</p>
<p>&quot;All the big push was from abroad. Foreign buying dried up the day after the exchange rate band changed,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is now correcting and will refocus on company fundamentals.&quot;</p>
<p>Top loser was power giant Endesa which plunged 5.86 percent to 241 percent on profit-taking, said dealers.  </p>
<p>Endesa, which accounts for a 20 percent weighting in the IPSA index, had soared 30 percent over the last three weeks.</p>
<p>Power stocks are expected to continue unsettled in coming months on poor fourth and first quarter earnings, they said.</p>
<p>Hydro-electric generators, like Endesa, have been hurt by this year's drought which has forced them to make up for low power supplies from their dams by buying expensive power on the spot market.</p>
<p>Other losers included paper-maker CMPC, down 3.53 percent at 4,625 pesos and power utility Chilgener which declined 2.17 percent to 2,485 pesos.  </p>
<p>Winners included power firm Edelnor, up 7.03 percent at 198 pesos and fruit juice maker Jucosa which rose 2.27 percent to 18 pesos.</p>
