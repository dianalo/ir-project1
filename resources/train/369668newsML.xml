<p>The risk of developing diabetes was 2-1/2 times lower among women who ate a low-sugar, high-fiber diet, according to a study published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Diets laden with such foods as white bread, cooked potatoes, white rice and cola beverages increased the risk of developing the disease, which affects 14 million Americans.</p>
<p>Healthy foods found to be low in &quot;glycemic load&quot; included whole grain breads, high fiber breakfast cereals, yogurt, beans and peanut butter, Harvard University researchers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Beyond the well-known risk factors for (adult-onset diabetes) of age, obesity, family history, sedentary lifestyle and smoking, our finding supports the hypothesis that a diet with high glycemic load and a low cereal fiber content increases risk of (diabetes),&quot; author Jorge Salmeron of the Harvard School of Public Health said.</p>
<p>The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, examined data from the multifaceted Nurses' Health Study and included more than 65,000 nurses 40 to 65 years old, 915 of whom developed diabetes. Women who consumed the most sugar and who ate the least fiber had 2-1/2 times more risk of contracting the disease than women who ate little sugar and a lot of fiber.</p>
<p>The nurses were questioned on diet and diabetes beginning in 1986 with a follow-up six years later. The study supported the findings of a smaller one involving Israeli men.</p>
<p>&quot;Because these results are so strong and consistent with previous evidence about the protective benefits of a high fiber diet, we suggest that grains be consumed in a minimally refined form to reduce the risk of diabetes,&quot; co-author JoAnn Manson, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, said.</p>
<p>Among sources of dietary fiber cited by the researchers, cereal was associated with a 28 percent reduced risk of developing diabetes while fruit and vegetable fiber had little impact either way.</p>
<p>The researchers said people with diets high in sugar and low in fiber were likely to develop chronic high demand for insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas to convert blood sugar. If the pancreas cannot respond to that need, and insulin resistance exacerbates the effect, glucose tolerance and diabetes can result.</p>
<p>Diabetes has been found to increase the risk of heart disease and stroke and is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in adults, kidney failure and nerve damage.</p>
