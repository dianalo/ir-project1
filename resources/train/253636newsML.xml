<p>British Prime Minister John Major's ruling Conservatives lost more support, according to an opinion poll released on Thursday, and a key minister resigned in disgrace over a &quot;sleaze&quot; scandal.</p>
<p>Bitter internal divisions over Europe took a turn for the worse when a prominent pro-European Conservative threatened not to stand in the next general election if Major concedes too much ground to the vocal &quot;Eurosceptic&quot; wing of the party.</p>
<p>At the same time, the party faced losing its majority, with the opposition Labour Party expected to win a by-election on Thursday in the northern English city of Barnsley.</p>
<p>An opinion poll in the newspaper The Times gave the Conservatives 30 percent, down three points on a month ago.</p>
<p>Labour was up one point to 51 percent, giving it a head start in the election Major must call by next May.</p>
<p>The Conservatives suffered a serious blow on Wednesday when David Willetts resigned his ministerial post as Paymaster-General, in which he had been responsible for planning and presentation of government policy.</p>
<p>He had been criticised by fellow members of parliament investigating allegations of so-called &quot;sleaze&quot;.</p>
<p>Willetts quit after the release of a report which said he had not been &quot;frank and open&quot; in evidence to a parliamentary committee investigating whether MPs took cash to ask parliamentary questions for businessmen.</p>
<p>The report by the Standards and Privileges Committee came close to accusing Willetts of lying, which would have meant his suspension or expulsion as a member of parliament.</p>
<p>The resignation came as the government hit more trouble in parliament at the opening of a two-day debate on Europe.</p>
<p>Finance minister Kenneth Clarke was jeered by anti-European Conservatives when he said getting rid of the pound sterling would not mean joining a European superstate.</p>
<p>Labour's finance spokesman Gordon Brown seized on the Conservatives' divisions, saying Clarke &quot;spoke with passion and conviction, but did he speak for the Conservative Party?&quot;</p>
<p>As his majority has dwindled, Major has had to pay more attention to Eurosceptics who want him at least to rule out British entry into the single currency for the next five years.</p>
<p>But Edwina Currie, an ardent pro-European, threatened not to stand for parliament if Major caved in to the Eurosceptics.</p>
<p>The former minister told the party leadership: &quot;This far and no further. Don't budge any nearer to the Eurosceptics.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't win a single vote. You are not going to do this party, this government or this country any good by shifting.&quot;</p>
<p>Major technically lost his one-seat majority last week when an angry member of parliament withdrew support over the closure of a hospital ward. But the MP did not formally quit the party.</p>
<p>But when the votes are counted in the safe Labour seat of Barnsley East in the early hours of Friday, the Conservatives will officially lose their majority.</p>
<p>Labour is not expected to move at once to a vote of no confidence as the Conservatives could rely on the support of nine pro-British Northern Ireland Ulster Unionists.</p>
<p>But Labour can make life tough for the Conservatives in parliamentary committees which scrutinise legislation.</p>
