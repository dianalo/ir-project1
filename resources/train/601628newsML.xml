<p>Albania, locked in political crisis over plans for a general election, on Wednesday awaited the outcome of last-ditch efforts by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino to find a compromise.</p>
<p>Fino on Tuesday launched a late-night effort to meet a deadline to solve the crisis set by European envoy Franz Vranitzky, who said time was running out and the country's fate hinged on a solution by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Officials at Fino's office were not available early on Wednesday to say what the results of his talks were and no statement had come from any of the government parties he was due to meet.</p>
<p>Most political parties are threatening to boycott the election over election rules they say are biased in favour of President Sali Berisha and his former ruling Democratic Party.</p>
<p>As Vranitzky's deadline approached, Fino's office said the prime minister had met Berisha and that the president had agreed to some amendments to the election rules.</p>
<p>Fino later intended to hold a meeting with his nine-party national unity government.</p>
<p>Vranitzky said time was running out for Albania after Fino failed to solve the crisis in marathon talks on Monday, which the premier had said could have &quot;unforeseen consequences&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Time is running out. The government of national reconciliation, the prime minister and the president must reach agreement today,&quot; Vranitzky said in a statement after talks in Vienna on Albania with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>
<p>The vote is regarded as the most important first step in restoring order to Albania, torn apart by a popular insurrection involving riots and looting in March.</p>
<p>Amid intense Western concern, Italy and Greece had added their voices to the chorus of warnings from governments.</p>
<p>Albania is still tense after a wave of riots and looting in February and March when thousands of people lost their money in the collapse of crooked pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>Vranitzky has made five fruitless trips to Albania since the unrest began and could return this week.</p>
<p>Annan also urged agreement after the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The parties must understand that they have to strike a compromise in order to reach an agreement,&quot; Annan said.</p>
<p>Fino appealed to the West for help to solve the crisis and spoke with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Vranitzky and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum.</p>
<p>Italy, leading a multinational force protecting humanitarian aid, on Tuesday called again for political compromise and Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta said the next 24 hours were &quot;very important&quot;.</p>
<p>Greece said failure to reach an election compromise would jeopardise the continued presence of the 6,000-strong eight-nation troop force. Western countries have already warned they may cut aid to Albania unless elections go ahead.</p>
