<p>British tour operator First Choice Holidays Plc said on Thursday bookings for this summer were six percent higher at June 21 this year compared with last year.</p>
<p>The company said net margins had improved for the period, while load factors were considerably higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall trading performance for this summer is in line with expectations,&quot; First Choice said in its first-half earnings statement.  </p>
<p>The company's loss narrowed to 22.8 million stg for the six months to April 30 from 23.4 million a year earlier, excluding a charge of 8.6 million stg in the current period.</p>
<p>First Choice said it took the charge due to accounting errors made in prior periods.</p>
<p>The company added that the charge did not hurt its cash position or current year trading.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reorganised and strengthened the financial control function and recruited new personnel,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>First Choice's shares were marked up 1.0p at 94 by 0730 GMT.</p>
<p>Regarding its outlook, the company said bookings to date in the UK were 18 percent ahead for winter 1997/98, with margins also signicantly improved.</p>
<p>The company also said it was encouraged by bookings for next summer.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident of continued improvement in profitability arising from the greater focus on managing the core businesses,&quot; the firm said.</p>
