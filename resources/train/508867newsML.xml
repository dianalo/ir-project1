<p>Bulgaria's exiled King Simeon, on his second visit to his homeland after 50 years, made an outspoken call on Tuesday to political forces to unite in a broad coalition after Saturday's elections.</p>
<p>Simeon urged voters to support planned market reforms, which he said were essential to attract foreign investment and to integrate Bulgaria with European institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Political pluralism is more appropriate to Bulgaria than the two-party Anglo-Saxon model,&quot; the bearded, balding monarch told a ceremony commemorating Bulgaria's first constitution.</p>
<p>&quot;Bulgaria needs a reformist majority, as President Stoyanov has said, and this can be achieved only through cooperation by the parties which support the reforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Simeon, 59, said that he had made the trip to clear up misrepresentation of his position, and condemned what he said was the irresponsible attitude of the information media.</p>
<p>&quot;Attempts by many people to use my name...as well as implausible speculation, made me come here today in order that you may hear clearly from me in my mother tongue what concerns me,&quot; said the monarch, who left Bulgaria in 1946.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who think that Simeon divides Bulgarians into Monarchists and Republicans, Left and Right, are wrong, as I am stretching out my hand to everyone. I am interested in what unites us, not what divides us. Patriots can be found in every camp,&quot; he said in a speech frequently interrupted with applause and chants of &quot;Simeon, Simeon&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I am appealing to everyone to vote. Vote for implementation of reforms and thereby for the integration of the country into the European structures,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The King, clad in a pin-striped suit and carrying flowers presented by well-wishers, received a rapturous welcome from some 10,000 people gathered outside the hall where the 1879 Tarnovo constitution, which called for a constitutional monarchy, was drawn up.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy to be among you because for the first six years of my life I bore the title of Prince of Tarnovo but unfortunately this title had to be laid aside until 1960 when my first son was born, Prince Kardam, who is very proud to bear this title now,&quot; Simeon told the crowds massed in the narrow cobbled streets of the ancient mountain town.</p>
<p>Tuesday's speech, broadcast live by national radio and television, was the most outspoken political intervention yet made by the King, who returned to Bulgaria for the first time for a three-week visit last May.</p>
<p>The main monarchist parties have formed a coalition with the ethnic Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms which is expected to be the third biggest group in the new parliament.</p>
<p>Other monarchist movements are allied with the centre-right Union of Democratic Forces, which is expected to win a majority in the new parliament and is seen as more sympathetic to the monarchist cause than the previous Socialist administration.</p>
<p>The King will spend the night at the mountain village of Arbanassy in a white marble residence built by former communist dictator Todor Zhivkov.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he will fly to Sofia for lunch with President Petar Stoyanov before returning to Madrid.</p>
