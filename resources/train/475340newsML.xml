<p>The bodies of a Turkish woman and five of her children who died in a suspected racist arson attack in the Netherlands were buried in eastern Turkey on Saturday to cries of &quot;Damn Europe&quot; from some at the funeral.</p>
<p>The state-run Anatolian news agency said the six were buried after noon prayers in the township of Eleskirt in the eastern Turkish province of Agri.</p>
<p>&quot;I've brought you six martyrs,&quot; Zeki Kosedag, the father who survived the fire, told the crowd at the funeral in Eleskirt.</p>
<p>The fire broke out at the family home at The Hague on Tuesday night, trapping the woman and the five children. Zeki Kosedag and the couple's five other children escaped by jumping from an upstairs window. Two of the surviving children are still in hospital with serious injuries.</p>
<p>Environment minister Ziyattin Tokar, the governor of Agri and local officials were at the funeral.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident will not remain unsolved. As a government, we will pursue this,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted Tokar as saying.</p>
<p>Turkey's state minister for human rights, Lutfu Esengun, and Tokar earlier said Europe should look to its own rights situation before criticising Turkey, whose European aspirations are hindered by a shaky human rights record.</p>
<p>&quot;It is extremely saddening that a baby that had not even completed its 30th day was among those who died,&quot; Tokar told Anatolian. &quot;Such incidents, which repeatedly take place in Europe and particularly target Turks, are remarkable.&quot;</p>
<p>The city's mayor told relatives of the victims that the fire had apparently been deliberately set, according to Dutch newspaper reports, although he emphasised in a television interview that it was still unclear who was responsible or what their motives were.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo has sent a letter of condolence to the Turkish ambassador expressing his sympathy to bereaved relatives and his assurances that every effort would be made to solve the case quickly.</p>
<p>Minister Esengun said a government delegation was hoping to visit the Netherlands next week for talks, to see what measures were being taken against racism and the latest attack in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident is the gravest abuse of human rights,&quot; he said. &quot;Ending the right to live, to kill innocent people are acts that have been left behind the times. Unfortunately, this is happening in Europe on the brink of the 21st century.&quot;</p>
