<p>British airports operator BAA Plc said it will be seeking double digit growth in earnings and dividends over the five years from April 1997, despite a slowdown in traffic growth and a big capital spending programme.</p>
<p>Finance director Russell Walls said this was the aim although annual growth in passenger traffic was likely to slow to an average of around four percent, compared to five percent in the last five years.  </p>
<p>&quot;The job that we have to do is to continue to deliver double digit earnings and dividend growth from a slightly more difficult base,&quot; Walls told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Without making any forecast, that's what we are about to try and do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BAA had said that passenger traffic growth in the half-year to September 30 at its seven British airports was up by just 3.3 percent, reflecting a fall in European charter traffic and lack of spare peak summertime capacity at London Heathrow.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile BAA's airline user charges at its main London airports, which are governed by a five-year review process, must be cut by the Retail Price Index (RPI) measure of inflation less three points a year for the five years from next April.</p>
<p>The current five-year formula imposed annual price changes ranging from RPI minus eight points in the first two years, RPI minus four in 1994/95 and RPI minus one in 1995/96 and 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;We have now got RPI minus three points for five years but passenger growth is probably lower, averaging about four percent, partly because of constraints coming in at Heathrow at peak hours,&quot; said Walls.  </p>
<p>Walls hit out at media reports that, should it come to power, Britain's opposition Labour Party would soon after impose a &quot;windfall tax&quot; on BAA under its proposal of levying a one-off charge on former state utilities.</p>
<p>Labour says a certain number of utilities such as the water and power companies were sold off too cheaply by the Conservative government and led to &quot;fat cat&quot; executives overpaying themselves and their shareholders with the proceeds.</p>
<p>Walls said BAA does not know yet if it is included in Labour's sights since it has not yet named its targets. A newspaper said recently BAA could face a 500 million stg bill.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we are we will be making very strong representations as to why we should not be in the loop,&quot; Walls said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not a utility, we are not a fat cat, we have not paid either special dividends or returned money to shareholders or made any mega acquisitions to get rid of our money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Walls said BAA argues it has done everything the utilities should have done, investing heavily in the business with a multi-billion stg development programme underway including plans to build a giant fifth passenger terminal at London Heathrow.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are not cash-rich unlike the utilities and we have a huge investment programme which we have effectively contracted to undertake with our regulator. If they (Labour) take x hundred million stg out of our pockets we will just have to say that is x hundred million stg less investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BAA earlier reported pre-tax profits rose only 3.4 percent to 304 million stg in the six months to September 30 and earnings were up just 3.3 percent to 22.2 pence a share. The interim dividend was raised 9.1 percent to 4.5 pence.</p>
<p>But it said underlying pretax profits were up 10.5 percent and earnings up by 11.1 percent.  </p>
<p>BAA said this was because it made a nine million stg exceptional gain in the comparable period a year ago. It was also phasing out seasonal fluctuations in airport user charges which had reduced income by 11 million stg in the first half but would be recovered in the second half.</p>
<p>Walls said BAA would now be seeking to boost retail revenues from the shopping arcades it has built at most of its terminals.</p>
<p>First-half net retail income rose 10.7 percent to 224.5 million stg with passengers spending an average of 4.20 stg each, 7.2 percent more than a year ago.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a matter of getting more people to spend and to get those that do spend to spend more,&quot; said Walls.</p>
<p>Total group revenue including retail was up 6.3 percent at 742 million stg. Income from airport user charges increased by 1.8 percent to 283 million stg. Revenue from property rose 7.7 percent to 112 million stg.</p>
<p>Earlier BAA also launched a new subsidiary, World Duty Free, to develop its duty-free retailing business worldwide and to take over next year the duty free shops at its own airports currently managed for it by Swissair.</p>
