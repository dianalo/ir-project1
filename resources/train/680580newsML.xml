<p>The French chairman of Eurotunnel warned rebel shareholders their investment could disappear if they failed to back its debt restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Patrick Ponsolle, in an interview with financial daily Les Echos to appear on Tuesday, said it was &quot;irresponsible&quot; to suggest the Channel tunnel operator could be saved from bankruptcy if investors rejected the plan, which was the best banks were ready to offer.  </p>
<p>&quot;If there is a 'no' vote at the shareholders' meeting, it will be extremely difficult to avoid bankruptcy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ponsolle's interview was to be published on the day of a special shareholders' meeting to decide on the debt plan, but the issue was expected to be shelved until the July 10 annual meeting since a quorum was not expected at Tuesday's gathering.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an illusion to imagine that the banks would be ready to negotiate a new plan if a minority of shareholders blocked agreement to the current one,&quot; Ponseolle said.  </p>
<p>Many of the banks, located in several countries, already found the terms of the restructuring too generous, he added.</p>
<p>A copy of the interview was supplied to Reuters in advance.</p>
<p>French shareholders' associations who are fighting for better terms than the ones announced, after lengthy talks, in April said on Monday they could have enough votes for a blocking minority at Eurotunnel's annual meeting on July 10.  </p>
<p>As the stakes rise between creditor banks and shareholders ahead of that meeting, the radical ADACTE group and more moderate Eurotunnel Shareholders' Association both said they could have enough votes to control the outcome.</p>
<p>Another shareholder force is led by French lawyer Sophie L'Helias, who represents small and institutional investors.</p>
<p>She has set tough conditions on backing the plan, including that creditor banks abandon 25 percent of their loans and the possibility of a &quot;right of substitution&quot; which would ultimately allow the banks to take over Eurotunnel's cash-flow.  </p>
<p>Ponsolle said the banks would exercise this right if the shareholders blocked the plan and this would give them control of its cash-flow for several decades.</p>
<p>He said the &quot;double or quits&quot; strategy of big fund managers, whose Eurotunnel investments were a tiny part of their empires, had little in common with the interests of ordinary investors.  </p>
<p>&quot;It would really be too stupid to accept passively, or to choose through disappointment, a path which has every chance of leading to an immediate and definitive loss of their investment, just when the company is making a vigorous recovery and when there is a real hope, if they accept the plan, that their shares will be properly valued in the course of time,&quot; Ponsolle said.</p>
<p>He said Eurotunnel was ahead for the first half of 1997 on the best-case projections published in its debt restructuring prospectus in May. He had high hopes the company would meet its goals for 1997 as a whole.</p>
<p>If all goes well, Eurotunnel said in its prospectus it hoped to show a net profit in 2005 and pay a dividend the next year.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel's  shares closed unchanged in Paris on Monday at 6.45 francs, down from a 1997 high of 8.1 francs and a historic high of nearly 50 francs in January 1994.</p>
