<p>Spot electricity prices in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic rose Wednesday on outlook of warmer weather moving into the region next week, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The six to 10 day forecast showed much warmer weather up into Maine,&quot; said a Houston trader.</p>
<p>A few participants were skeptical how large an increase in power demand clearer skies and higher temperatures would bring.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect any more load,&quot; said one regional utility trader, adding that the price rise may be more associated with idling of some fossil-fueled palnts for the weekend.</p>
<p>He noted utilities often plan to idle a certain amount of &quot;baseload&quot; generation or shift it to &quot;peak&quot; status over the weekend when it is considered more expensive to operate on a marginal basis during low-load periods.</p>
<p>In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect power pool, electricity prices for firm, peak delivery on Thursday were assessed at $20.25-$22.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), a wider range than Tuesday's $21.00-$21.50 range.</p>
<p>Firm PJM power for light load hours on Thursday was quoted at $13.00-$13.25, compared with Tuesday's $13.25.</p>
<p>PJM firm, peak electricity for next two days was valued at $20.25-$21.25, up from Tuesday's $20.00-$20.50 range.</p>
<p>Peak, firm power for the balance of September was discussed at $19.75-$20.75, up from Tuesday's $19.50 area, with unconfirmed deals done today at $20.25 and $20.50.</p>
<p>October firm, peak PJM electricity was quoted at $20.40-$20.50, narrower than Tuesday's $20.00-$20.50.</p>
<p>November PJM power was pegged at $21.50-$21.60, tighter than $21.45-$21.70 on Tuesday. December PJM was assessed at $25.40-$25.50, better bid than Tuesday's $25.00-$25.50 range.</p>
<p>PJM delivery in the 1996 fourth-quarter was quoted at $22.40-$22.60, tighter than a range of $22.30-$22.60 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>January/February 1997 PJM power was valued at $29.20-$29.35, with a trade last reported at $29.25.</p>
