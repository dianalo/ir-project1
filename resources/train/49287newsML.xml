<p>The Philippines expects to sign a ceasefire accord next week with another major Moslem guerrilla group after signing a peace pact recently with the country's biggest Moslem rebel force, a top official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The expected signing on September 19 of the ceasefire agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will be followed by peace talks with the group within 10 days, Presidential Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said.</p>
<p>Manila last week signed a peace deal with the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) ending a 24-year war for Moslem self-rule in the south that killed 125,000 people.</p>
<p>The MILF was formed as a breakaway group in the late 1970s by then MNLF commander Hashim Salamat after a rift with MNLF chairman Nur Misuari, who signed last week's peace accord.</p>
<p>The military had said the rift was caused by a power struggle between two groups.</p>
<p>The MNLF originally fought for an independent Moslem state but abandoned its goal and settled for regional autonomy. The MILF and two smaller guerrilla groups demand an Islamic state.</p>
<p>The military estimates MNLF strength at about 16,000. It puts MILF strength at between 6,000 and 8,000 but some army officers regard the group as more dangerous than the MNLF because of its hard-line stance.</p>
<p>The other factions, including the extremist Abu Sayyaf group which the military has blamed for a spate of bombings and kidnappings in the southern islands, are believed to number only a few hundred.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that by the 19th of September we will be signing an agreement (on a ceasefire) with the MILF,&quot; Torres told reporters after returning from the southern island of Mindanao where he said he met Ghadzali Jaffar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs.</p>
<p>The signing will be held in Cagayan de Oro, a largely Christian city in Mindanao.</p>
<p>&quot;We will work out safety and immunity guarantees for (MILF) leaders who will be negotiating so they will be free to move around,&quot; Torres said.</p>
<p>Manila's peace deal with Misuari has enraged some Christians, who fear Moslem political ascendancy in Mindanao, which Filipino Moslems regard as their ancestral homeland although they are now outnumbered 3-to-1 by Christians.</p>
<p>Armed forces chief General Arturo Enrile said the military would launch a house-to-house search if Christian vigilantes opposed to the peace deal with the rebels defied orders to surrender their weapons.</p>
<p>President Fidel Ramos has said the vigilantes are illegal and ordered the army to disarm them, using force if necessary.</p>
<p>Some vigilante leaders say they have 3,000 armed men under their command. Newspaper reports quoted others as saying there were as many as 10,000 vigilantes.</p>
