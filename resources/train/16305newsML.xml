<p>President Boris Yeltsin may soon study details of Alexander Lebed's Chechnya peace plan, but his reluctance to meet his security chief has put both the plan and Yeltsin's overall control of the situation in doubt.</p>
<p>Aides to Lebed said Yeltsin, 65, might &quot;possibly&quot; meet Lebed or talk to him by telephone after receiving documents about the peace plan at 5 p.m. (1300 GMT). The Kremlin could not confirm whether a meeting was planned.</p>
<p>Security tsar Lebed, Yeltsin's special representative in Chechnya, had interrupted talks with Chechen separatists at the weekend, saying he had to consult the president on proposals for a political settlement in the region.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin, who has been on holiday near Moscow since Monday, has not yet agreed to meet the general.</p>
<p>&quot;It is obvious that Boris Yeltsin has decided definitively to distance himself from the activities of Alexander Lebed in Chechnya until events there reach a final phase,&quot; Sevodnya newspaper wrote on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The weekly magazine Itogi, in an article written before Lebed returned to Moscow, cast doubt on whether Yeltsin was fully in charge.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know to what extent the recently reelected Russian president controls the situation in Russia. And if not to the full extent, who does it instead of him?&quot; it asked.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, reelected on July 3, has insisted that Chechnya is an integral part of the Russian Federation and his reaction to Lebed's peace initiatives has been confused and contradictory.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's vague holiday plans also prompted speculation about the health of the president, who had two heart attacks last year. Russian and Western media said Yeltsin needed an operation on his heart.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press office denied the rumours and, in the event, it was Yeltsin's wife Naina who went into hospital, checking in to Moscow's top clinic for a &quot;planned operation&quot; on a kidney.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said on Monday that Yeltsin had been in frequent contact with Naina by telephone and she was expected to be released soon. But the president appeared to have gone on holiday without actually visiting his wife.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky has said Yeltsin would remain in control of affairs of state during his vacation at the Rus guesthouse, 100 km (60 miles) from Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;(Yeltsin) controls internal and international policy and daily receives a big packet of documents from Moscow, which demand his intervention. Many of those documents return to the president's administration the same day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was reelected after a gruelling campaign during which he travelled frequently and danced for the crowds and the television cameras. But he disappeared abruptly on June 26 and has looked stiff on his rare appearances since then.</p>
<p>Itogi said Yeltsin's televised interview last week had not managed to dispel rumours about his health. &quot;His long absences still give rise to gloomy suspicion,&quot; the magazine wrote.</p>
