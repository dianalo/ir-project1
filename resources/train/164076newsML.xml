<headline>Tight security for Turkish president German trip.</headline>
<dateline>BERLIN 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Turkish President Sueleyman Demirel began a four-day state visit to Germany under tight security on Monday in Berlin.</p>
<p>A group of about 150 demonstrators, led by Amnesty International, booed and whistled as Demirel entered Berlin's city hall. They were protesting against what they called human rights violations against separatist Kurds in Turkey.</p>
<p>Police struggled with a number of demonstrators and several were detained by authorities.</p>
<p>Demirel, who will meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday in Bonn, walked with Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen through Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, closed off by more than 100 police for the visit.</p>
<p>Security was tight because of police concerns there might be disturbances from the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK). Police and the PKK have clashed on numerous occasions in recent years.</p>
<p>German President Roman Herzog welcomed Demirel at his Bellevue Palace residence. Herzog had raised the issue of human rights with Demirel during a state dinner.</p>
<p>The Turkish president also met with 35 representatives from local Turkish groups.</p>
<p>Berlin has Germany's largest Turkish population. There are 138,000 Turks living in Berlin.</p>
