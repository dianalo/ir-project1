<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Saturday renewed a U.S. call for North Korea to make a &quot;gesture&quot; toward the South to acknowledge its submarine incursion last September was a serious mistake.</p>
<p>The United States views the incursion as a &quot;highly provocative incident (and) continues to believe the North Koreans should make a gesture that indicates they have a similar assessment of the seriousness of that action,&quot; he said on the eve of talks between the U.S. and South Korean presidents in Manila.  </p>
<p>Christopher, who met his South Korean counterpart on Friday to prepare for the presidents' meeting on Sunday, said Washington and Seoul were in &quot;total convergence&quot; on dealing with the Stalinist North.</p>
<p>Both governments were committed to carrying out a 1994 landmark U.S.-North Korean nuclear accord, he said. Both were also &quot;fully agreed on the importance of four-party talks&quot; on a new peace agreement for the Korean peninsula as proposed by Washington and Seoul earlier this year, he said.</p>
<p>Tense relations between the two Koreas worsened after a North Korean submarine landed 26 suspected agents on a South Korean beach in September. Twenty-four of them were shot dead, one was captured alive and another is still at large.</p>
<p>South Korea had said it will suspend all assistance to the North, including financing the nuclear deal, until it &quot;clearly apologises&quot; for the submarine incident and guarantees such an incident will not be repeated. The North insists the incident was an accident.</p>
