<headline>Spanish consul in Cuba says tourist case overblown.</headline>
<dateline>HAVANA 1997-03-19</dateline>

<p>The Spanish consul in Havana on Wednesday played down the seriousness of a case in which a Spanish tourist was prevented from leaving Cuba following a traffic accident.</p>
<p>Consul Eduardo Cerro told Spanish reporters in Havana that the version of events published by a Madrid daily on Wednesday was overblown and that the tourist, Jesus Martin, was not in detention.</p>
<p>In Madrid, Foreign Minister Abel Matutes threatened to issue a travel advisory and take other measures against the communist-ruled island to demand the tourist's release.</p>
<p>&quot;This situation is intolerable,&quot; Matutes told state radio. &quot;Spain is going to use all its resources and those of its European partners to get his immediate release and return to Spain.&quot;</p>
<p>But Cerro said the problem over Martin appeared to have been one of lack of coordination between judges and the police, according to the Spanish journalists in Havava.</p>
<p>Martin, 30, told Reuters television that he had still not received a definite reply from Cuban authorities but expected his case to be resolved in the next two days.</p>
<p>He added that the consul, who accompanied him to visit police on Wednesday, had helped clear things up.</p>
<p>Martin was involved in a traffic accident last month in Havana in which the passenger on a motorcycle with which his vehicle collided was slightly injured.</p>
<p>Martin was detained at a police station for one night following the accident but then released, although he had to stay in Cuba pending a trial.</p>
<p>The trial was set for March 14 but did not take place because the other party did not appear. The judge said at the time that Martin had not been at fault in the accident and could leave the country. But the police stopped him from doing so.</p>
<p>Cerro, who said the problem appeared to be lack of coordination between the Cuban authorities, said the Spanish Embassy on Tuesday asked the Cuban Foreign Ministry to intervene with the police in the case.</p>
<p>Officials at the Cuban Foreign Ministry were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Relations between Spain and Cuba cooled after Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's conservative government took office in May 1996, promising a tougher stance toward the island than that of its Socialist predecessor.</p>
<p>Tensions flared in November when Cuba withdrew formal approval for a new Spanish ambassador, accusing Madrid of interference in its affairs following a steady stream of criticism by Spain of President Fidel Castro's government.</p>
<p>Both sides then sought to smooth over the dispute, although Spain has still not designated a replacement ambassador.</p>
<p>Some 115,000 Spanish tourists visited Cuba last year, making them the third largest group of foreign visitors to the island after Italians and Canadians.</p>
