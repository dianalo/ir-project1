<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) Issue Department foreign exchange assets rose to the lev equivalent of 3.487 billion marks on August 1 from 3.117 billion marks a week earlier, BNB figures showed.</p>
<p>&quot;The assets rose by 370.6 billion levs to 3.487 trillion levs mainly due to net foreign currency purchases and the mark fall, which boosted the mark price of the dollar-denominated part of the assets,&quot; a BNB official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Under an IMF-prescribed currency board regime introduced on July 1 the lev was pegged at 1,000 per mark as an anchor in the system and the BNB has pledged to buy and sell unlimited volumes of marks at 995 levs bid and 1,000 ask.</p>
<p>The currency board bans the BNB from lending to the government and commercial banks and requires levs in circulation to be fully matched by the Issue Department's assets, which make up the BNB foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>The cash and nostro accounts in foreign currencies rose to the lev equivalent of 1.721 billion marks on August 1 from 1.432 billion marks on July 25, BNB figures showed.</p>
<p>BNB holdings in foreign securities rose to 1.118 trillion levs from 1.041 trillion levs.</p>
<p>Apart from holdings in foreign securities and cash and nostro accounts in foreign currency, the Issue Department assets included 640.7 billion levs in monetary gold and 8.1 billion levs in accrued interest receivable on August 1.</p>
<p>Any rise in the Issue Department assets allows for a limited rise of the lev currency in circulation without accumulating inflationary pressure under the currency board.</p>
<p>The mark fall against the dollar on global markets last week boosted the lev price of the Issue Department foreign exchange assets, because they were mostly held in dollar-denominated instruments.</p>
<p>Under the BNB law the market value of the assets, denominated in foreign currency other than the mark has been limited to two percent of the total BNB liabilities denominated in the same currency.</p>
<p>So far there are no official figures on BNB operations to transfer part of dollar reserves into mark-denominated assets.</p>
<p>Currency in circulation, part of the Issue Department liabilities, rose to 832.8 billion levs on August 1 from 806.3 billion levs on July 25.</p>
<p>The department's liabilities also included 698.3 billion levs in bank deposits and current accounts on August 1, down from 727.7 billion levs a week earlier.</p>
