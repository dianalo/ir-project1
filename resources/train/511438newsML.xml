<p>Labour leader Tony Blair said on Tuesday the Conservatives would be &quot;like ferrets in a sack&quot; over Europe if they won the May 1 election.</p>
<p>Speaking to the party's daily press conference, Blair said: &quot;You can't have strong leadership with a divided Conservative Party. They can't fight for Britain's interests if they are fighting among themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Attacking Conservative divisions, he said that if they won next month &quot;They would be like ferrets in a sack, they'd be tearing themselves apart.&quot;</p>
<p>Divisions in the ruling party were highlighted on Tuesday when party vice-chairman Angela Rumbold said she was opposed to a single European curency. Official party policy is to adopt a &quot;wait ans see&quot; stance.</p>
<p>The campaign has also been marked by personal attacks with both sides trading insults over education policy and Europe.</p>
<p>Blair criticised the Conservatives for negative campaigning, saying: &quot;I think they are turning people away from the Conservative Party by this kind of abuse ... No matter what the Tories do, we will carry on with this positive campaign.&quot;</p>
