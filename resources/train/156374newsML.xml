<p>Moldova's external debt has reached $700 million, but the government is planning to attract more loans from abroad to ensure market reforms continue, a senior minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing tragic or secret about our debts -- the loans were necessary to start radical reforms...Anyway, these $700 million are well below internationally recognised critical levels,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Ion Gutu told a news conference.</p>
<p>Gutu said Moldova's external debt accounts for 30 percent of its gross domestic product, which is expected to exceed $2 billion this year, whereas international lenders view 40 percent of GDP as a critical for confidence in a country's solvency.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has so far disbursed to Moldova about $260 million, remains the main lender, Gutu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks to IMF loans, Moldova has obtained macroeconomic stability with low inflation, and National Bank reserves are more than enough to keep our leu currency stable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Annual inflation is likely to fall this year to some 15-17 percent from 23.8 percent in 1995, and the leu introduced in November 1993 is stable at around 4.60 to the dollar.</p>
<p>The National Bank has recently estimated its reserves at over $280 million and expects them to grow to $310-315 million by the year-end.</p>
<p>The World Bank, Russian government and European Union have so far lent Moldova $130 million, $111 million and $105 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Gutu said that taking into account Moldova's current external debt its total borrowing abroad could reach $1.4 billion by 2005-2008.</p>
<p>Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Cheptine said the government hoped to attract $100 million a year for the next two years from the World Bank and the same amount from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for concrete investment goals.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing now is to get investment loans to channel them into production and ensure annual GDP growth of 4-5 percent, so that new loans do not become burdensome for the economy,&quot; Gutu said.</p>
<p>He said that in line with government forecasts the former Soviet republic, which is sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, and which has lost over 50 percent of GDP in tough reforms, would regain pre-reform production levels of 1989-1990 only in the first decade of the next century.</p>
<p>Gutu later told Reuters the mostly agrarian economy, which was hit by a severe drought in the summer, was expected to grow this year by a moderate two percent, compared to initial forecasts of 7.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;But, to be frank, there may be no growth at all in 1996. GDP has so far fallen by some four percent this year,&quot; he said.</p>
