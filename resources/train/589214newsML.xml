<p>Hovnanian Enterprises Inc said it expects net earnings per share for fiscal 1997 to be significantly below its previously announced target of $0.75 per share, which was the amount it earned in fiscal 1996.  </p>
<p>The company expects operating earnings for fiscal 1997 to be comparable to the $0.75 earnings per share for fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>Hovnanian said it expects to report an operating loss in the second quarter ended April 1997 due to lower second quarter home deliveries than it anticipated, a higher than expected percentage of deliveries in communities with lower margins and the continued weak performance of its Florida operations.  </p>
<p>Hovnanian also said it is planning to exit the investment properties business by selling its investment properties, which will require it to report either writeoffs or gains for the sale of those properties in the second quarter.  The company said it has not as of yet calculated the required writeoffs.</p>
<p>In addition, the company will stop capitalizing interest on communities in planning which are not under active development in the second quarter, which will reduce the amount of interest capitalized.</p>
<p>Finally, the company said it will dramatically reduce its investment in its southern Florida operations to approximately $25 million from $50 million due to the continued poor performance in Florida.</p>
<p>Hovnanian Enterprises designs, constructs and markets single-family homes, townhomes and condominiums in planned residential communities.</p>
