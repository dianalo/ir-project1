<title>UK: NWE naphtha edges down, freight rates lock up trade.</title>
<headline>NWE naphtha edges down, freight rates lock up trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-27</dateline>

<p>NWE naphtha prices edged lower with crude to kickoff the week but high freight rates continued to cast a shadow on physical trade and keep buyers and sellers far apart on deals.</p>
<p>Traders were also looking for signs of end-user demand for February to unlock the stalemate.</p>
<p>&quot;The freight rates are keeping the numbers up but the end-users are not willing to pay up,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The sellers are having difficulty accepting a loss because of the freights.&quot;</p>
<p>Feb swaps slipped $2 to $218/$219.50 a tonne, tracking a modest 13-cent selloff in IPE Brent crude futures. March swaps shed about 75 cents on the bid side to $213/$214.50 and April was unchanged at $208/$209.</p>
<p>NWE cargoes were notionally unchanged at $220/$222 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Two Russian parcels of 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes were seen available in NWE, along with some FOB material. Little material was seen moving from the Med to the north, and the arbitrage from Northwest Europe to the States was said to be shut.</p>
<p>Because of the closed arbitrage and weakness in gasoline prices, naphtha's crack spread relative to crude should fall, from about $52 currently to $45, the trader said.</p>
<p>Another trader said high paraffinic material was still able to fetch a healthy price, of about high quotes plus $3-$4, but other material was hard to place and the cargo market looked rich.</p>
<p>&quot;The physical interest is there but it is slow and shipping is still the same old story,&quot; this trader said.</p>
