<headline>CBOT Dec wheat ends higher on domestic stocks.</headline>
<text>
<p>Traders also said the wheat futures were firm because the market is not expecting any wheat to be posted for delivery against the December contract. Friday, November 29 is first notice day for deliveries on the CBOT December contracts.</p>
<p>Technical indicators included a bullish alert from the four- and 20-day moving averages for the December through May contacts.</p>
<p>First resistance in the December was at $4.17 per bushel and second resistance was at $4.30-1/2. First support was at $4.03-1/2 and second support at $3.90.</p>
<p>The daily short term nine day relative strength index (RSI) for December closed at 65 points and the 14-day RSI was at 58.5 points. The market generally considers an RSI of 70 or more as overbought and 30 or less as oversold.</p>
<p>Wheat futures volume was estimated at 17,000 contracts, below the 28,475 traded Thursday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>Wheat options volume was estimated at 5,000 contracts, below the 9,921 traded Thursday.</p>
