<p>Belgian Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) has no plans to divest any of its holdings, but on Wednesday confirmed for the first time its French parent Compagnie de Suez is debating a merger.</p>
<p>In recent weeks the 175-year-old holding company has been the focus of rumours that it planned to sell non-strategic holdings and the centre of speculation that Suez plans merge with its French utilities unit Lyonnaise des Eaux .</p>
<p>&quot;We are happy with our current portfolio and we see no reason to change it,&quot; SGB chairman Etienne Davignon told a news conference on 1996 earnings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>SGB's six core stakes are utility group Tractebel, Generale Bank , insurer Fortis AG, non-ferrous metals group Union Miniere (UM), foam products group Recticel and French electronics group Sagem .</p>
<p>Earlier this month SGB chief executive officer Philippe Liotier was quoted as saying the stakes in UM and Recticel &quot;were not forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eternity is a philosophical concept,&quot; Davignon said. People had been wrong to conclude that UM and Recticel would be sold in the coming months.</p>
<p>The ever-witty Davignon had to field a barrage of questions about a possible Suez-Lyonnaise merger, an issue on which both French groups have declined to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;(A merger) is something maybe God and the Holy Spirit are aware of, but I have been trying to contact them on the Internet and I have not had many answers at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the same breath he confirmed for the first time that talks about a merger have taken place.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a fact that the board of Suez has not discussed (the possibility of a merger)...the hypothesis does exist, however, but no decision has been taken about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He declined to say at what level talks about the merger had been held.</p>
<p>But he added that, for instance, the merger between SGB units Tractebel and Powerfin , announced on Tuesday, had been discussed for two years between himself and Tractebel executives before a formal proposal was made to the boards of the respective companies.</p>
<p>&quot;To discuss something is one thing. It does not mean it is immediately put to the board. Once you go to the board you have to come up with a concrete proposal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Davignon said that he had gone to Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to explain the possible impact in Belgium of such a merger.</p>
<p>Belgian authorities have expressed concern that a Suez-Lyonnaise merger would harm Belgian interest in the utility sector, as it would increase an already strong French grip on Belgian utility group Tractebel.</p>
<p>SGB -- whose units represent 25 percent of the value of the Brussels bourse's blue-chip Bel-20 index -- is 63.4 percent owned by French Suez.</p>
<p>SGB's group net profit rose by 22 percent to 11.22 billion ($323 million) francs from 9.21 billion in 1995. The group proposed to pay an unchanged dividend of 87 francs ($2.7) per share, but decided not to offer an optional share dividend, as had been expected by many analysts.</p>
<p>A stock dividend would have been a way to keep cash in the group, which is saddled with 20.4 billion francs ($588 million) worth of debt after boosting its stake in Tractebel last year.</p>
