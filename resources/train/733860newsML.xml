<p>When it comes to success stories, the epic saga of Belgian drugs, fine chemicals and plastics films company UCB on the Brussels bourse is assuming proportions that defy even the label &quot;overblown&quot;.</p>
<p>A strong management, a well-defined liking for market niches and solid earnings prospects make UCB shares hot, but at current levels even the keenest of investors should look for a cooling-off period before buying, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>UCB shares were up 6.2 percent at 146,100 francs($3,950) by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, just off a 147,000 record high.</p>
<p>The stock had been well-supported since October 1996, but it took off in early June, rising from levels just below 100,000 francs to current peaks, interrupted only briefly by a spell of light profit-taking and stability from mid to late June.</p>
<p>Specific reasons for the bull run were hard to find. Tuesday's market reports spoke off a single, unnamed buyer snapping up the few UCB shares offered to an illiquid market.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the situation was little changed, although some progress was made on the location of the buyer - London.</p>
<p>&quot;There is strong demand from London,&quot; a trader said. Others spoke of &quot;buy&quot; recommendations for UCB, but noted there had been no new ratings recently. News of bumper sales for UCB's star drug Zyrtec in the U.S. was in line with expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;Is somebody taking a position, or does somebody know of new products in the pipeline?,&quot; a trader wondered. He said the rapid surge of the share was &quot;suspect.&quot; But it could a simple case of players &quot;jumping on the running train.&quot;</p>
<p>A third said UCB had an &quot;incredible growth strategy... something you see in the evolution of sales and profits. Its policy is very expansive.&quot;</p>
<p>Analyst Danny Wittenberg at broker Dewaaij said UCB was in the &quot;Warren Buffet league&quot; of growth stocks which systematically outperformed by the market by dozens of percents.</p>
<p>UCB sales grew from 47 billion francs in 1992 to nearly 52 billion in 1996, but profit growth was a more explosive, more than doubling over the five-year period to 5.8 billion.</p>
<p>More will be coming. Company chief executive officer Georges Jacobs has already indicated he expects 1997 earnings growth of about 30 percent.</p>
<p>However, all of that was known to the market for weeks and could at best be supportive for the share price, but not a reason to drive it up as sharply as happened in recent days.</p>
<p>Dealers said talk of a single buyer, apparently hungry for UCB stock at any price, fanned takeover speculation. Names doing the rounds are fellow Belgian group Solvay and Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, both of the U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S. groups could be interested in getting their hands on Zyrtec, a competitor to their anti-allergy drugs, and at the moment might be able to do so relatively cheaply in view of the dollar's strength vis a vis the Belgian franc, analysts said.</p>
<p>Zyrtec sales are expected to reach $250 million this year. Sales in the second quarter -- peak hayfever season -- rose by 94 percent to $70 million, UCB's U.S. marketing partner for Zyrtec, Pfizer, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Solvay has stated it wants to strengthen its pharmaceuticals division and an incorporation of UCB would result in relatively few overlaps with existing Solvay products, they said.</p>
<p>However, two reasons argue against a Solvay buy. There would be few synergies between the two, or in other words little to be gained in terms of economies of scale, they said.</p>
<p>In addition, Solvay and UCB shareholders are largely the same. &quot;So why would they buy UCB shares in the market?,&quot; asked KB Securities analyst Juergen Fryges.</p>
<p>Some pin their hopes on buoyant first-half results due at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Dewaaij's Wittenberg expected current earnings per share to rise by 33 percent to 2,175 francs. Current pre-tax earnings would rise to 3.91 billion francs from 2.92 billion.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, UCB shares were fully valued, KB Securities' Fryges said. &quot;On a fundamental basis the share is now a 'hold', but I would not say 'take your profit and run'.&quot;</p>
