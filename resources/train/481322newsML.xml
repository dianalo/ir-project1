<p>Some Brazilian millers have joined local wheat growers to demand the government maintain new financing restrictions on imports announced last week.</p>
<p>Fecotrigo, which represents growers in Rio Grande do Sul state, Wednesday sent the government a fax demanding the measures be maintained.</p>
<p>The millers in turn have spoken out against a demand by the Brazilian Association of Wheat Industries (Abitrigo) that wheat be exempted from the rules because it is a necessary import.  </p>
<p>Brazil imports some five million tonnes of wheat every year, a large proportion of it from its Mercosur customs union partner Argentina.</p>
<p>The government last week announced restrictions on import financing of under a year, with the aim of preventing importers from benefiting from low international interest rates. The rules apply to goods shipped after March 31.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Pedro Malan Wednesday said Brazil's Mercosur partners would be partially exempt from the measures for 120 days, but it was not immediately clear which sectors would be excluded from the law.  </p>
<p>Abitrigo President Antenor Barros Leal Tuesday said wheat should be exempt from the rules, warning the law could inflate the price of flour and cause cash-flow problems for some mills.</p>
<p>But some Abitrigo members said they disagreed with the demand and Leal's arguments were flawed. The Union of Sao Paulo Wheat Industries has protested to Abitrigo about not being consulted on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe Leal is in the minority. I don't agree with what he said,&quot; said Lawrence Pih, president of Moinho Pacifico.  </p>
<p>Brazilian millers have little choice but to buy wheat from Argentina and other countries and the new rules should cause a rise of two percent, at worst, in the price of flour, Pih said.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil doesn't have many alternatives -- we don't invent wheat here,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;The worst scenario is we'll have an increase of two percent on end-product.&quot;</p>
<p>Jacques Berliner, president of Moinho Vera Cruz, said the new rules were positive in the sense that they provided an incentive to domestic growers to plant more wheat.</p>
<p>&quot;There are diverging positions among millers. This measure is preferable to a sudden change in currency rates,&quot; Berliner said.  </p>
<p>Both agreed some millers could experience cash-flow problems but said it was up to each individual company to handle its own finances. &quot;What you need is obviously some cash-flow planning,&quot; Pih said.</p>
<p>Growers in the Fecotrigo cooperatives association want the new measures to remain because they say the rules level the playing field between domestic growers and Argentine producers.</p>
<p>Currently, the average financing period for wheat imports is 180 days at an interest rate of eight percent. The financing period for domestic purchases is 30 days maximum, at variable rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;All we want is to benefit from the same financing conditions as Argentine producers,&quot; said Fecotrigo spokesman Paulo da Silva. &quot;Evidently if this policy was maintained the planted area for wheat would increase,&quot; he said. &quot;But Brazil does not function like Europe, where policies are set out for five years. Policies here change from year to year and now, week to week.&quot;</p>
<p>The government needed to define a wider-ranging policy with regard to wheat, which da Silva said accounted for $1.2 billion of Brazil's $5.5 million trade deficit in 1996.</p>
