<p>The Singapore stock market was flat at mid-morning on Tuesday, with activity lacklustre and fresh trading incentives missing, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0200 GMT, the Straits Times Industrials Index was down 2.57 points at 2,027.64. Volume was a meager 16.9 million shares with 70 gainers against 51 losers.</p>
<p>The 1.1 percent year-on-year increase in Singapore's April production output after five months of falls failed to inspire trading as the rise was anticipated after the release of the April non-oil domestic exports in late May.</p>
<p>Snaker maker Want Want Holdings adjusted for a bonus issue.  </p>
<p>It was trading US$0.42 lower at US$3.10, which equated to US$3.60 after adjusting to the isssue. GK Goh Research kept its &quot;buy&quot; recommendation for Want Want.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally, it is still very good. Its China operations are doing very well,&quot; said GK Goh analyst Teo Hiang Boon.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy into six months or more time frame given it will post the fastest earnings growth among the big-cap food and beverage companies.&quot; Its price target was US$3.80 after adjusting to the bonus issue.</p>
<p>Malaysian timber firm North Borneo, focus of many merger rumours, rose S$1.20 to S$21.40. -- Angela Tan (65 8703083)</p>
