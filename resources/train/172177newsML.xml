<title>UK: UK Building Socs Bill doubtful starter - minister.</title>
<headline>UK Building Socs Bill doubtful starter - minister.</headline>

<p>The Building Societies Bill, which would allow the institutions to engage in a wider range of activities, could well not pass into law before the next general election, a government minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly would not suggest that it is a racing likelihood,&quot; the minister, who declined to be identified, said.</p>
<p>He said the government had already agreed to add a number of bills to its legislative programme for the current session of parliament, which must be curtailed because a general election is due by May 22.  </p>
<p>It was therefore doubtful whether sufficient time could be found to discuss the provisions of the Building Society Bill, he said.</p>
<p>Addressing a Building Societies Association meeting earlier on Thursday, economic secretary to the Treasury Angela Knight said she could not promise the Bill would get parliamentary time.</p>
<p>But she went on: &quot;What I can promise you, though, is if you, the industry, decide that you want this Bill, then that vastly strengthens my hand and I will do everything I can to get your Bill that time in the legislative programme.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mike O'Brien, an economics spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said he had asked for a meeting with Knight to discuss the Bill.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government seem to have decided to revive the Bill without giving it parliamentary time,&quot; he said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767</p>
