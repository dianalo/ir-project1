<headline>Bradford tops market flummoxed by raw wool, forex.</headline>
<dateline>BRADFORD 1997-01-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading in tops at the Bradford wool market was restrained on Thursday after an extremely mixed week for raw wool in the major production centres, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It all just compounded the general uncertainty caused by currency movements and people are having trouble deciding whether to place orders or not,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to establish any kind of price trend,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Australia's primary market achieved a healthy clearance rate at higher prices while the dollar weakened, but in New Zealand which also saw a softer local currency, the market fell by five percent.</p>
<p>The situation in Australia and New Zealand described the diverging fortunes of fine and coarse raw wools across the world's markets and was reflected in Bradford on Thursday.</p>
<p>Finer tops gained two to three pence per kg with 70s Super trading at 479 pence per kg but at the opposite end of the spectrum, Englishes lost three to four pence per kg, sources said.</p>
<p>The 58s, both Blended and Super, were quoted unchanged.</p>
