<p>An Argentine police drug squad on Wednesday raided Diego Maradona's club Boca Juniors, the Argentina Football Association and a sports training centre where routine soccer match drug tests are examined.</p>
<p>Boca spokesman Ivan Pavlovsky told reporters at the Buenos Aires grounds of Argentina's most famous club that police &quot;asked for players' dope-test records and took them away.&quot;</p>
<p>He said they were interested in the records of tests done two months ago on Maradona -- who admits he takes drugs and was banned for 15 months for failing a drugs test at the U.S. World Cup -- and Deportivo Espanol player Martin Vargas.</p>
<p>The test on Maradona, who recently spent 10 days at a Swiss drugs clinic to try to beat the habit, was negative. The test on Vargas was positive.</p>
<p>The result caused an outcry in the sports press with Dr. Americo Ecuardo Ciarrochi, pushing a new dope law through Congress, asking in the sports newspaper El Grafico: &quot;How can it be that Vargas' test is positive while that of Maradona, who recognises he is an addict, does not?&quot;</p>
<p>AFA Chairman Julio Grondona, taken by surprise by the raid, told reporters police could &quot;take whatever they want, from the basement to the top floor where the caretaker lives.&quot;</p>
