<p>A controversial tax break for ethanol, a corn-based gasoline additive, will come under increased scrutiny this year as foes of &quot;corporate welfare&quot; take aim at dozens of federal subsidies.</p>
<p>Analysts and market watchers say proposals to sunset the 5.4-cent a gallon excise tax exemption have better chances to pass this year and will bring to battle the lobby titans of Big Oil and Agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;The new concentrated eye Congress is casting on corporate welfare is likely to boost chances to exempt ethanol from tax incentives,&quot; said Gary Goldberg of the American Farm Association.</p>
<p>The tax break for ethanol -- a large income source for corn growers -- was put in place in the 1970s as part of government efforts to promote domestic energy sources following the Arab oil embargo.</p>
<p>The exemption has been maintained to help the industry become cost effective and compete with the more popular gasoline additives made from oil and natural gas. Ethanol and other additives are rich in oxygen, which is required in gasoline formulations by the Clean Air Act of 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;The subsidy would have had made more sense if the government had forced some of it go to research into cutting production costs. But that never happened,&quot; said George Unzelman, a California-based fuel consultant.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to tell who will win but it will be a tough fight,&quot; Unzelman added.</p>
<p>At a news conference Wednesday deputy majority whip of the U.S. House of Representatives, Republican Dennis Hastert, said the cost-cutting climate in Washington makes it unlikely the federal subsidy will be extended beyond 2000, when it comes up for renewal.</p>
<p>His comments come on the heels of a bill that was introduced by Republican Representative Phil English of Pennsylvania last month. The bill aims to end the exemption for large ethanol producers after 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We reformed welfare to get people off the dole on the job,&quot; said English, who is a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to do the same thing for corporations. The best start we can make is to end the ethanol subsidy, which puts hundreds of millions of dollars in the pockets of one corporation, Archer Daniels Midland.&quot;</p>
<p>English charges the vast majority of the ethanol subsidies have gone to ADM and cost the government $770 million in lower Federal revenues. ADM, the single largest U.S. ethanol producer, makes more than half of the total U.S. capacity of about 1.6 billion gallons per year.</p>
<p>Farm groups, however, say the subsidy has helped open up a market for farmers, providing them with $2.2 billion in income and adding more than $7 billion to the national economy.</p>
<p>&quot;If the ethanol industry dies than corn growers will see a big market vanish,&quot; said the Farm Association's Goldberg.</p>
<p>The ethanol industry is the third largest buyer of the U.S. corn crop, consuming six to seven percent of annual U.S. corn production, according to the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;The farm angle is an important angle people don't realize,&quot; said an economist at the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;Seventy-one percent of the two million farms in the U.S. had an annual sales of less than $40,000, &quot; the economist said, adding ethanol has been a big boon for corn growers.</p>
