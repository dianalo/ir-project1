<p>Scientists on Monday said the area around the Mars Pathfinder landing site was hit by a catastrophic flood billions of year ago.</p>
<p>Using pictures from the Pathfinder lander, scientists said floods around the Ares Vallis basin were about the same size as those that created the Mediterranean sea.</p>
<p>Michael Malin, one of the scientists, speculated the flooding was hundreds of miles (kilometers) wide and sent water surging at a rate of about 35 million cubic feet (one million cubic metres) per second.</p>
<p>&quot;A comparable flood on Earth would be the one that filled the Mediterranean Basin,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Evidence of the flood could be seen by the fact that large boulders were stacked up against each other as if they had been pushed by the flood waters, Malin said.</p>
<p>He said he believed that crusts on the rocks were formed by salt and sediment from the flood waters as they receded and left puddles on the rocks. A similar crusting pattern could be seen on rocks in Hawaii thrown out by volcanic activity, he added.</p>
<p>Mission scientist Matthew Golombek said the findings so far posed the question, &quot;Could early Mars have been much warmer and wetter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The implications are enormous because liquid water is the key ingredient for life,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the Mars expeditionary programme, which will send four more landers to various sites on the planet over the next eight years, is to discover if life, even in its most primitive form, ever existed on the Red Planet.</p>
<p>Scientists also want to know where the water went and what happened to what they believe was an atmosphere that was once as dense as Earth's but is now much thinner.</p>
<p>Signs of the flooding were clearly visible in what the Pathfinder scientists refer to as &quot;The Monster Pan&quot; -- a vast panoramic view of the dusty red Martian surface and the salmon coloured sky so large that it is best viewed as a video.</p>
<p>The &quot;Pan&quot; is a composite made up of hundreds of images sent back by the Pathfinder spacecraft following its picture perfect landing on Mars last Friday. Other photos unveiled on Monday showed the Sojourner rover backed up against a rock almost as big as itself, affectionately named &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; by the crew at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.</p>
<p>Displaying the picture, Golombek told reporters: &quot;This shows how the rover nestled up and affectionately kissed Barnacle Bill.&quot;</p>
<p>Sojourner, a six-wheeled vehicle about the size of a microwave oven, backed up to the rock late on Sunday and scanned it with its alpha proton X-ray spectrometer for 10 hours, sending a wealth of data back to earth.</p>
<p>Scientists said on Monday they hoped to be able to give at least a preliminary analysis of the rock's composition on Tuesday. They hope to learn eventually how the planet was formed, what changes occurred over the years and whether life ever existed on Mars.</p>
<p>Golombek said &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; was of particular interest because it is not dusted by the red Martian soil that covers other rocks. The same is true of &quot;Yogi,&quot; a much bigger rock that resembles a bear, which the rover will take a look at later on Monday.</p>
<p>In addition, cameras on board Sojourner and the Pathfinder lander craft continued to send a stream of pictures back to Earth, including closeups of rocks and the sandy soil that covers much of the Martian surface.</p>
<p>Scientists have taken the opportunity for light relief in naming the rocks that show up in the pictures. One is named &quot;Flat Top,&quot; another is &quot;Casper&quot; after &quot;Casper the Ghost&quot; because it has a whitish hue and one has been dubbed &quot;The Couch&quot; because it looks like one.</p>
<p>&quot;Perfectly&quot; was Golombek's favourite word on Monday as he briefed reporters. &quot;We had a very productive day (on Sunday). The spacecraft is operating perfectly, the rover is working perfectly and the instruments are working perfectly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Even the computers on board the lander and the rover were speaking to each other &quot;perfectly&quot; following a communications glitch between the two that was overcome on Saturday, he said.</p>
