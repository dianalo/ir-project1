<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday the government may restrict import of heavy machinery in the 1998 annual budget to check a ballooning current account deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we want traders to voluntarily stop importing the machinery but if they don't, we are thinking of putting restrictions on the import,&quot; Mahathir was quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency in Kuching, capital of the Borneo state of Sarawak.  </p>
<p>He said continuous import of construction related heavy machinery such as cranes, excavators and bulldozers had contributed significantly to the country's balance of payments deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;The traders must realise that this deficit is a national problem and it will affect the traders themselves later on,&quot; he was quoted as telling reporters at the end of a two-day visit to Sarawak.</p>
<p>The prime minister said there was a lot of such machinery in the country and yet their import continued.</p>
<p>&quot;In Kuching alone, you can see yards and yards full of this thing (heavy machinery) and yet they are still buying and if we keep on with our bad habit, the deficit will never go away,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When asked to elaborate on the type of restrictions the government was going to impose, Mahathir said he would have to consult the Finance Minister on the measures.</p>
<p>Last week, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the 1998 budget, to be tabled in Parliament in October, would look at serious measures to curb Malaysia's imports and focus on expanding exports.</p>
<p>The government, he had said, would take into account any monetary measures including the use of taxes to increase exports and reduce imports.</p>
<p>The two leaders' statements follow over a month of speculative selling pressure on the ringgit, which has eased by 12 percent against the U.S. dollar in the period.</p>
<p>Many economists have expressed concern over the cost of imports rising for Malaysia, which was not yet out of the woods as far as its current account deficit problem was concerned.</p>
<p>The economists had feared in 1995 that the economy was overheating after Malaysia reported a 9.5 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth and current account deficit at over eight percent of the GDP.'</p>
<p>Malaysia responded by bringing down GDP growth to 8.2 percent and the deficit to five percent of GDP in 1996.</p>
<p>Mahathir has ignored suggestions for slowing down growth to let the supply and demand balance return. He has said Malaysia would instead reduce imports.</p>
