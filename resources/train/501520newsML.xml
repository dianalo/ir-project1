<p>Japanese exporters, enjoying an unexpected profit windfall from the weak yen, are holding off on converting overseas earnings into yen and this could fuel a further rally by the dollar, dealers say.</p>
<p>The dollar's bull run has made exporters such as major carmaker Toyota Motor Corp, which gets an extra 10 billion yen ($78.7 million) in profits for every one-yen decline in the dollar, reluctant to buy yen.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been selling dollars (for yen) bit by bit because there's little threat of a dollar plunge right now,&quot; said a finance department official at a major Japanese carmaker.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the dollar clearly rose above the previous 125 yen ceiling earlier this week, we now expect the dollar to hover in a 123-130 yen range,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Currency dealers said major Japanese exporters have delayed arrangements to exchange dollar-denominated earnings from overseas into yen since the start of the 1997/98 fiscal year on April 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Some conservative exporters who usually arrange their future dollar sales to cover the following three months are taking a flexible stance,&quot; said Wataru Ito, deputy general manager of the Treasury Department at Sanwa Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>Declining dollar sales pressure from exporters will clear the way for the dollar to rise further, he added.</p>
<p>The dollar has picked up strength over the past month, following a rise in U.S. interest rates in late March and due to a growing view that Japan's central bank is unlikely to change its easy monetary policy any time soon. It was standing at 126.20 in afternoon Tokyo trade after hitting 127 yen earlier, its highest since August 1992.</p>
<p>Akira Shimura, manager of the foreign exchange finance division at Toshiba Corp, said: &quot;Compared to the past two years, we are for the most part holding back on arrangements for dollar sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Any major reversal of the dollar's bull run is unlikely to take place without a change in Japan's macroeconomic policies such as an increase in Japan's interest rates,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Exporters have grown more cautious amid an increase in the cost of selling dollars through forward contracts, which would erode their overseas earnings.</p>
<p>If exporters sign contracts to sell dollars for yen for the following three-month period, for instance, they have to pay a charge of 1.68 yen for every dollar. That compares with 1.46 yen at the start of the year.</p>
<p>A one yen difference in the dollar/yen rate can have a big impact on the earnings of Japanese exporters.</p>
<p>Toyota would get an extra profit of about 10 billion yen ($78.7 million) for every one yen fall, and Nissan Motor Co would reap seven billion yen ($55.1 million), company officials said.</p>
<p>Analysts say exporters are beginning to rely heavily on higher overseas profits to offset lower earnings at home as they cut prices domestically to remain competitive.</p>
<p>The weaker yen has lifted the profits of Japanese exporters by making the cost of their products more competitive overseas. But it has also fuelled a rise in Japan's current account surplus, straining ties with its key overseas trade partners.</p>
<p>During a visit to Tokyo last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin urged Japan to guard against a resurgence of its trade surplus. But he also said Japan's current account surplus has fallen from the equivalent of 3.1 percent of gross domestic product in 1993 to 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Historically, political friction will become stronger when the ratio rises to two percent,&quot; said Kenji Yumoto, senior economist at the Japan Research Institute Ltd.</p>
<p>The institute estimates the ratio will stay at an average of 1.6 percent for the current fiscal year. ($1=127 yen)</p>
