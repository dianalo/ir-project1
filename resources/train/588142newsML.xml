<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end mostly up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end mostly up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly up on Thursday supported by a rebound on the domestic A share markets, traders said.</p>
<p>But the annual rate for the most active seven-day contract fell to 8.21 percent from 8.45 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market rose slightly to 3.9 million losts from 3.8 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders said the rising A share markets led institutions to borrow more money on the repo market on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The repo rates won support from the rebounding A share markets, but a lack of new A share issues depressed some early-maturing contracts,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the rates to continue to rise in the next few days with the seven-day contract having the potential to rise more than other contracts.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up on Thursday mainly because of the high yields of exist spot contracts, which now stand at more than 10 percent on average, traders said.  </p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 rose to 120.90 yuan from 120.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market rose sharply to 1.3 million lots from 605,528 lots.</p>
<p>Traders said they believed the spot markets would go up in the next few trading sessions.</p>
