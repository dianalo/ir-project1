<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ Treasury tells Act NZ fiscal position unchanged.</title>
<headline>NZ Treasury tells Act NZ fiscal position unchanged.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Zealand Treasury Secretary Murray Horn said in a letter to Rodney Hide, finance spokesman for the Act NZ party, that there had been no fiscal developments which were causing new economic pressures.</p>
<p>He was commenting on a letter Hide sent to Labour Party finance spokesman Michael Cullen in which he said briefings by Treasury and the Reserve Bank for Act made it clear the economy was on a knife edge.  </p>
<p>&quot;I have consulted with the governor (of the Reserve Bank), and I need to point out that this impression is neither the detail nor the tenor of the briefings that we offered,&quot; Horn said in the letter, dated October 29 and made public on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our briefing went through issues since the (September) Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update was completed, and showed that little had changed.</p>
<p>&quot;The Governor similarly went through his September forecasts and outlined developments since that time,&quot; Horn said.  </p>
<p>Other reporting of the briefings was not consistent with the idea that they revealed new and disturbing developments, Horn said, citing comments from Act leader Richard Prebble.</p>
