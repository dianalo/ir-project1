<p>Bad light finally drew the curtain on Sri Lanka's brave bid to register a first test win in West Indies on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Needing 269 to win and starting the final day on 97 for two, exhilarating batting by Aravinda de Silva (78) and captain Arjuna Ranatunga (72 not out) took Sri Lanka within reach of their target.</p>
<p>But then fast bowlers Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose struck with two wickets apiece and in the end West Indies looked the more likely victors as Sri Lanka fell to 233 for eight before bad light ended the match.</p>
<p>West Indies took the two-match series 1-0 after winning the first test in Antigue by six wickets.</p>
<p>De Silva gave Sri Lanka the positive start they needed, hitting fast bowler Ian Bishop for two boundaries in his opening over.</p>
<p>Although he lost overnight partner Roshan Mahanama, caught behind for 29 off Bishop, de Silva continued to carry the attack to the West Indies bowlers, reaching his half-century in exactly one hour from 47 balls and hitting nine fours.</p>
<p>With Sri Lanka reaching 179 for three by lunch, victory looked well on the cards, but then the entire afternoon session was lost because of a storm and another break for rain after tea put extra pressure on the visitors.</p>
<p>After de Silva was bowled by Walsh with the total on 189, no-one else was able to give Ranatunga the support he needed and in the end it was Sri Lanka who were battling to avoid defeat.</p>
<p>Walsh was the best of the West Indies bowlers, finishing with four for 73.</p>
