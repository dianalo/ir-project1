<p>Israel has stepped up calls for resumption of peace talks with Syria but Damascus, wary of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, insists he first promise to hand back the Golan Heights Israel captured in 1967.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said on Wednesday he was exchanging messages with Damascus indirectly and appealed to his Syrian counterpart to meet him to revive peace talks.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he was guardedly optimistic progress could be made in negotiations with Syria during his term in office. He was elected to a four-year term in elections last May.</p>
<p>He told Israel Television he believed an intensive effort would be made to resume the talks now that U.S. President Bill Clinton had begun his second term in office.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk has said that Israel's withdrawal from most of the West Bank town of Hebron last week under a deal with the PLO should be used as a &quot;springboard&quot; for Syria talks.</p>
<p>The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that Levy and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara had been exchanging messages through an unidentified European cabinet minister.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the things which Syria in fact intends in its strategy -- the way it is passed to me -- is peace. So the messages I am passing are with this aim,&quot; Levy told Israel Radio when asked about the newspaper report. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Speaking later in Jerusalem to foreign ambassadors, Levy appealed to his Syrian counterpart directly: &quot;Please sir, as representatives of two countries that want peace...please, please, anywhere, at any hour, I am ready to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu on Wednesday refused to say whether he ruled out making territorial concessions on the Golan Heights. On-again, off-again peace talks that began in 1991 have been stuck over the fate of the Golan.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Syria) will demand the Golan. We see the Golan in a different way, as a strip of land that is critical to the defence of the State of Israel, to our security and water needs.</p>
<p>&quot;And that's how we'll enter these negotiations, from that standpoint, and we'll stand by it,&quot; Netanyahu said during an interview with Israel's Channel One television.</p>
<p>But he sidestepped the question when asked if he ruled out making any territorial concessions on the Golan for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not add any more than I've said,&quot; said Netanyahu, who has in the past opposed trading occupied land for peace.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;I am optimistic -- not optimistic in an unreserved way -- but optimistic in our ability to progress also with Syria during this (my) term.&quot;</p>
<p>Syria said there was nothing new in Levy's call. Shara in Damascus said Israel should resume the talks from the point at which they stopped with Israel's previous Labour-led government.</p>
<p>Syria has said Israel's prior government approved the principle of full withdrawal from the Golan Heights. That Israeli government had said it was ready for partial pullback from the Golan in return for full peace with Syria but did not make any public statement accepting total withdrawal.</p>
<p>Shara said that although a former government headed by Netanyahu's Likud party had approved the 1991 Madrid conference which based subsequent Arab-Israeli peace talks on the land- for-peace principle enshrined in U.N. resolutions, Likud made its own interpretation that contradicted the principle.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Wednesday the U.N. resolutions were the basis of the peace talks and &quot;everyone comes with his own interpretation... that is the framework that will allow us in my opinion to open negotiations&quot;.</p>
