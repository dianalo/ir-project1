<headline>Stocks fall on profit-taking, Microsoft provides excuse.</headline>

<p>Stocks tumbled on Friday as investors found an excuse to take profits after software giant Microsoft Corp. failed to report blockbuster earnings that they had hoped for.</p>
<p>Technology stocks, whose exuberant gains helped lead the market higher recently, tumbled and dragged other sectors down, analysts said.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average, which crossed the 8,000-point milestone this week, retreated 99.88 points, or 1.25 percent, to 7,920.89.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues outpaced advances by a 20-to-6 margin on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of 376 million.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index, laden with technology stocks, shed 19.29 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,549.56. Thursday the index closed lower for the first time in two weeks. Declines beat advances by a 12-to-7 margin.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had an amazing move since the Memorial Day weekend and we are consolidating,&quot; said Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. &quot;When you look at relative sector performance today, everything is going down.&quot;</p>
<p>Tech stocks and then other sectors became vulnerable to profit-takers after Microsoft posted fourth-quarter earnings of 80 cents a share, above the First Call consensus estimate of 79 cents but below so-called &quot;whisper numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>Whisper numbers refer to unpublished analyst estimates that circulate on Wall Street prior to earnings releases.</p>
<p>Investors had hoped for a &quot;blowout&quot; quarter similar to the previous three months, when earnings were 23 percent higher than estimates.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a doubt, it's profit-taking,&quot; said Frank Calta, managing director of institutional trading at Dain Bosworth. &quot;People used Microsoft as an excuse to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock was down 5-13/16 at 143-11/16. Chipmaker Intel Corp. lost 1-3/16 to 86-5/8, Ascend Communications Inc. fell 2-1/8 to 50-5/16 and Compaq Computer Corp. lost 3-5/16 to 128-3/4.</p>
<p>&quot;The only bright spot in the tech world is IBM,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp., due to report second-quarter earnings on Monday, bucked weakness among technology stocks to gain 3-5/16 to 103-1/8.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said it raised its 12-month price target to $150 per share, saying investor enthusiasm for IBM's prospects were growing.</p>
<p>The stock market also had to contend with the expiration of index futures and options, which added volatility.</p>
<p>In other trading, Micro Linear Corp. fell 5-5/16 to 8-1/4. It reported second-quarter earnings of 19 cents per share vs. 14 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Synopsys Inc. sank 8-1/8 to 30-1/8 as Goldman Sachs and Hambrecht Quist downgraded its ratings because of the stock's high price, even though it reported sharply higher third-quarter earnings.</p>
