<p>The Bank of Thailand intervened in Singapore foreign exchange markets on Friday to sell dollars at 26.025 baht after the Thai unit came under intense pressure on rumours it denied of a band widening, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The baht was quoted at 26.012/26.017 to the dollar at 0330 GMT after falling as low as 26.090 earlier, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the Thai central bank had also intervened earlier in the swap market, offering the six-month and one-year swaps.</p>
<p>The rumours, that the Thai central bank planned to widen the dollar/baht trading band, emerged in London markets overnight and prompted a sell-off in the baht.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of U.S. investment houses were trying to attack the baht and buy dollars yesterday and it's been quite hectic today as well,&quot; a U.S. bank dealer said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the baht had calmed down somewhat after the central bank's denial of the rumour and its intervention. But the currency was still trading well above Friday's mid-rate of 25.99 per dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;We should trade between 26.000 and 26.030 for the rest of the day,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, the central bank's division chief in charge of money and foreign exchange markets, told Reuters the Bank of Thailand had no plan to change the exchange rate mechanism.  </p>
<p>&quot;Rumours about any change in the exchange rate mechanism, including band-widening, are utter nonsense,&quot; he said.</p>
