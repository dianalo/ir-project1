<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle bids on Tuesday at $66.00 to $67.00 per cwt were passed by owners pricing cattle at $69.00 to $70.00, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales were expected to occur Tuesday or Wednesday starting at $68.00, they said.</p>
<p>However, fed cattle prices could turn higher if beef prices continue higher as expected, the sources said.</p>
<p>Beef prices on Monday were quoted up $0.12 to $0.55 per cwt on 117 fabricated loads sold, USDA said. Prices increased from the previous quote for the first time since early March.  </p>
<p>Showlists were larger than last week because of a carryover of unsold cattle, but weights continue to run about 20 lbs below a year ago, several sources agreed.</p>
<p>The size of the lists was not expected to weigh on cattle prices because packers are short-bought on inventory and need to replenish supplies to meet beef orders, cattle feeders said.</p>
<p>Beef demand reportedly was revived by steep price declines since March 4 that made beef attractive to retailers for post-Easter promotions, some sources noted.</p>
