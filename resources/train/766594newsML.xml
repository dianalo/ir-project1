<p>Florida's governor suspended Miami City Commissioner Humberto Hernandez Wednesday after his indictment on mortgage fraud and money laundering charges.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in the best interests of the residents of the City of Miami, Dade County, and the citizens of the State of Florida that Humberto E. Hernandez Jr. be immediately suspended from the public office which he now holds,&quot; Gov. Lawton Chiles said in an executive order issued in the state capital Tallahassee.</p>
<p>Hernandez, a 35-year-old lawyer, is accused of involvement in an $8 million mortgage fraud and money-laundering scheme involving luxury condominiums in fashionable neighbourhoods of Miami.</p>
<p>A total of 13 people were named in two overlapping indictments unveiled in Miami Tuesday. They allegedly amassed money through selling condomimiums among themselves at inflated prices after securing mortages with false documents and statements to financial institutions.</p>
<p>It was the latest scandal to hit Miami City Hall, although it did not involve Hernandez's position as commissioner directly.</p>
<p>Hernandez was elected last November to replace Miller Dawkins, who is serving a jail sentence on bribery and corruption charges. Former City Manager Cesar Odio is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice charges in the same scandal.</p>
<p>The governor's statement said Hernandez was being suspended with immediate effect because of the indictment.</p>
<p>&quot;Hernandez is hereby prohibited from performing any official act, duty or function of public office, from receiving any pay or allowance, and from being entitled to any of the emoluments or privileges of public office during this period of suspension,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Hernandez was released on $500,000 bail after appearing in court on Tuesday. The most serious charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment.</p>
<p>The alleged crimes were not connected with his position as city commissioner, U.S. officials said. The alleged scam was under investigation for two years.</p>
<p>Hernandez, a Miami-born Cuban American, was no stranger to controversy. He was dismissed as an assistant city attorney in 1994 for taking on private work from his office.</p>
<p>After the crash of a ValuJet plane in the Florida Everglades in May 1996, the Florida Bar tried to have him suspended for allegedly soliciting business from victim's families. He blamed employees.</p>
<p>His election to the five-person city commission was achieved with backing of Miami's majority Hispanic population but it angered blacks were left without a voice on the council for the first time in three decades.</p>
