<p>A U.S. soldier's car was damaged in a fire bombing outside his apartment in the Bosnian Serb-controlled town of Vlasenica early on Friday morning, the NATO-led peace force said.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the incident, the latest in a series of Serb retaliatory attacks over a NATO crackdown on indicted war criminals.</p>
<p>A &quot;Molotov cocktail type&quot; fire bomb hit the civilian vehicle used by an American military observer at 4:10 a.m. (0210 GMT), setting the car ablaze, NATO said in a statement issued from a U.S. base in Tuzla. The fire was eventually extinguished.</p>
<p>The attack occurred in Vlasenica, some 15 km (9 miles) from Bosnian Serb army headquarters in Han Pijesak.</p>
<p>A Dutch soldier was wounded by a hand grenade and a United Nations truck was destroyed in two separate attacks on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Dutch soldier was injured by shrapnel in the northwest Kotor Varos region when a drunken Serb lobbed a hand grenade at a group of Dutch soldiers trying to recover an armoured vehicle following a traffic accident.</p>
<p>The soldier was being treated at a Dutch military hospital in Novi Travnik where doctors said he was in stable condition.</p>
<p>Rocket-propelled grenades demolished the U.N. pick-up truck which was parked outside the apartment of a U.S. member of the International Police Task Force in the eastern town of Bratunac.</p>
<p>No one has been killed in the wave of revenge bombings which have followed a NATO raid two weeks ago against two Serbs indicted for war crimes.</p>
<p>One suspect was seized and extradited to face trial before the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague and the other suspect was shot dead after he opened fire on British soldiers trying to arrest him in the northwest Prijedor region.</p>
