<headline>German shares head into holiday in stable form.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-30</dateline>

<p>German shares were broadly stable in late electronic trade on Wednesday, regaining their composure following a downward dip on stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth data.</p>
<p>&quot;The market seems to be holding up well against shocks from the U.S. at the moment,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;I think the 3,400 (DAX points) level is pretty well secured.&quot;</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index was up 6.22 points at 3,432.08 points at 1404 GMT, having dipped to a low of 3,416.11 points after the early afternoon release of data showing 5.6 percent growth in U.S. GDP in the first quarter.  </p>
<p>Dealers said activity was extremely quiet ahead of the May 1 German public holiday on Thursday, during which the German share market will be closed.</p>
<p>Futures were dominating activity, dealers said, with little real movement on the cash market.</p>
<p>&quot;People are just establishing themselves in reasonably safe waters. There is always the fear that there will be major developments while we are closed,&quot; a Munich dealer said.</p>
<p>The June DTB DAX future was up 15 points at 3,446 points in afternoon trade. Gains were helped by the firm dollar, always a boon for Germany's export firms.  </p>
<p>Some dealers were optimistic that the market was well positioned to break out of its current lethargy.</p>
<p>More dividend payouts are expected in the coming weeks, which should boost liquidity as investors reinvest the payouts.</p>
<p>Chemical giant Bayer AG, trading ex-dividend, was down three marks, or over four percent at 67.20 marks. BASF AG, under pressure earlier after slightly disappointing first quarter results, was up 1.05 marks at 67.45 marks.</p>
<p>Electronics and engineering giant Siemens AG continued its recent run of popularity, fuelled by technical buy signals, to trade up 88 pfennigs at 93.93 marks.  </p>
<p>Car shares were also performing well, with Volkswagen AG up 30.5 marks, or 2.9 percent, at 1,098 marks.</p>
<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG was up 28.50 marks, or two percent, at 428.50 marks.</p>
