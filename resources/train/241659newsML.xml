<p>Four African leaders mediated on Saturday to end Central African Republic's third army revolt of the year and an associated spiral of ethnic bloodshed.</p>
<p>Officials and witnesses said mutineers observed a truce as the presidents of Gabon, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mali met embattled President Ange-Felix Patasse, opposition politicians and leaders of the revolt.</p>
<p>The foreign leaders had arrived in Bangui on Friday from a Franco-African summit. But Patasse, kept in power by French troops in May, came under attack from an alliance of opposition parties blaming him for the turmoil.</p>
<p>&quot;Three mutinies is too much. This is very serious and has to be sorted out by Africans as a family,&quot; Radio France Internationale quoted Gabonese President Omar Bongo as saying after meeting Patasse.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central African Republic must not become another Rwanda, a Somalia, a Liberia or a Sierra Leone,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Leaders of 11 opposition parties signed a memorandum for the mediators attacking Patasse. &quot;He is no longer in a position to embody national unity,&quot; said the memorandum, made available to Reuters.</p>
<p>They accused Patasse of ignoring accords that ended a mutiny in May -- especially disarming foreigners said to have joined the president's armed civilian militia.</p>
<p>Rebel soldiers, who launched their latest mutiny on November 16, say disarming civilians and mercenaries from Chad and Sudan is a prime objective. They halted efforts to disarm militias because of the talks.</p>
<p>The rebels, who on Thursday clashed with loyalist soldiers and French troops protecting Patasse, welcomed the mediation initiated by the Franco-African summit which ended in Burkina Faso on Friday.</p>
<p>Bangui remained tense but calm. Shops and businesses stayed closed.</p>
<p>However, residents said tribal killings continued, pitting southern Yakomas who dominate the rebel ranks against Patasse's northern Bayas. They reported abductions and killings by both sides.</p>
<p>Former interior minister Christophe Grelombe, a Yakoma, and his son were seized on Thursday and murdered.</p>
<p>Former colonial power France has voiced backing for the elected government but says its troops based in the country under defence pacts would not help it combat the mutineers.</p>
<p>&quot;French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities,&quot; French President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of the Franco-African summit.</p>
<p>The latest uprising began over pay demands and an attempt by Patasse to redeploy soldiers involved in May's revolt. The year's first revolt was in April.</p>
