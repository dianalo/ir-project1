<p>There is a 25 percent chance that Britain could slide into recession next year because of high interest rates, the strong pound and tight fiscal policy, according to a leading economic research institute.</p>
<p>&quot;While our central forecast for output and inflation in 1998 is relatively optimistic, showing low inflation with reasonable growth, it is quite likely that the actual outcome will be less benign,&quot; the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said in its quarterly economic review.</p>
<p>Its central forecast is for economic growth of around two percent in 1998 compared with the 3.25 percent annual growth rate seen in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>But as industrial production already appeared to be stagnant, tight government spending controls would limit public sector services output, the NIESR said. Growth in private sector services, therefore, might not be enough to maintain overall economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Our calculations suggest that there is a 15 percent chance of output falling in 1998 below its 1997 level. This would be a severe downturn,&quot; the NIESR said. &quot;There is a 25 percent chance that the out-turn is worse than that eventuality.&quot;</p>
<p>The NIESR said there were similarities between the state of the economy now, in the first months of Prime Minister Tony Blair's new Labour government, and in 1979, when Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came to power. Then, as now, the economy was growing rapidly and the pound was strong.</p>
<p>&quot;If sterling continues to rise in the way it did in 1979 and 1980, then there is a much more significant risk that the early years of the Blair revolution, like the Thatcher revolution, will be marked by a recession,&quot; the NIESR said.</p>
<p>The pound has risen over 25 percent against the deutschemark since last year, making it increasingly difficult for British manufacturers to sell their goods abroad. It was trading at around 3.08 marks on Wednesday, its highest level for eight years.</p>
<p>Current prevailing wisdom is  the economy is beginning to overheat because of soaring consumer spending, fuelled by payouts totalling around 35 billion pounds to millions of Britons as mutually owned building societies turn themselves into publicly quoted banks.</p>
<p>Noting that official interest rates had been raised three times in as many months to their present 6.75 percent level and that fiscal policy was tight, the NIESR said:</p>
<p>&quot;The policy question to be faced is not whether a reduction in the growth rate is desirable but whether the policy measures already in hand have done enough (or possibly too much) to achieve a 'soft landing.'&quot;</p>
<p>Tight monetary and fiscal policies were likely to lead to a slowdown in economic growth to two percent by the end of next year and a similar rate in 1999 from annual growth of 3.1 percent seen in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This forecast is based on the assumption that the exchange rate will decline modestly from current levels,&quot; the NIESR said.</p>
<p>It saw a significant risk that the economy would slow too quickly when the full effects of recent policy changes and the strong pound fed through to the wider economy, a risk that would increase if interest rates were raised again.</p>
<p>The institute said it expected the Bank of England's new monetary policy committee (MPC) to raise interest rates again to 7.0 percent during the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;But by the autumn we expect evidence of subdued inflation and a slowing economy to persuade the MPC that no further increase in rates is necessary,&quot; it added.</p>
