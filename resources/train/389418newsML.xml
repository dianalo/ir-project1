<p>NOTE: These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted, and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>- With 132 days to go before the British colony reverts to China, editorials in the Hong Kong media concentrated on the rumour that Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping's health had deteriorated.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMIC TIMES said there was no evidence that anyone could replace the position of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. It said that if Deng died, it was possible that China's political stability will be maintained as long as Jiang can stick to the reforms and open-door policy and make people richer.</p>
<p>-- HONGKONG STANDARD said that China's ruling party and the government under President Jiang had steadily distanced itself from Deng in recent years. Jiang had also put in place a cohesive leadership committed to the path of economic development and modernisatin. So Deng's passing would not matter and the torch had been passed on successfully.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMIC JOURNAL said the best way for Hong Kong chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa to prove that Democratic Party leader Martin Lee was wrong to accuse the new establishment of being undemocratic was to give Lee the freedom to say so overseas. It said Lee was not wrong to say Hong Kong people lacked confidence in the future, and the fact that so many people had emigrated proved this. The new government should be broadminded enough to tolerate both sensible and unsensible criticism, the Journal said.</p>
