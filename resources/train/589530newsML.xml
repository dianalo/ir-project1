<p>The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday will dominate the minds of traders and dictate the sentiment for world financial markets in the coming week, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The FOMC is definitely the dominant issue for next week, whether you are in Europe or elsewhere. The Fed has the ability to set the tone for most of next week,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>Later in the week the first round of French parliamentary elections on May 25 will provide a focus and an element of uncertainty as no more opinion polls will be published between now and then.</p>
<p>&quot;The French election is something we'll start thinking about towards the end of the week,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;The problem now for the markets is that there won't be any more polls until next Sunday so we're in a bit of darkness for the French market.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said a mixture of data from around the world including UK retail sales, Italian CPI and the Japanese trade balance would also be eyed with some interest, but markets were likely to be nervous and defensive ahead of the FOMC.</p>
<p>&quot;The week of an FOMC and the week ahead of a French election, people are unlikely to stick their necks out,&quot; said Alison Cottrell, international economist at PaineWebber.</p>
<p>Economists were split over the likelihood of a rise in U.S. interest rates at the May 20 FOMC. Many expected the Fed would hold fire following a week of soft economic data suggesting the U.S. economy could be slowing down.</p>
<p>They said no change in rates would spark a rally in the bond market and could also provide an upward impetus to dollar/yen, which plunged from four and a half year highs this month and lost almost ten percent of its value in only two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Textbook theory would tell you that the dollar would do badly if rates remain unchanged, but if we do see a rally in the credit market in the States then that could encourage some buying from overseas investors which could support the dollar,&quot; Coleman said.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen moves in themselves could provide a market focus because of the recent sharp slide and their potential to hurt U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing outside the fence will be the FOMC, but what happens to the dollar/yen in a market sense will be very much a focus as well,&quot; said Brendan Brown, economist at Tokyo Mitsubishi International.</p>
<p>Some also said it would not only be whether rates go up or not but also the way in which it may be done which traders would be keeping a wary eye on.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not just what they do but how they do it...it's how it's wrapped up, the words that go with it,&quot; Cottrell said.</p>
<p>&quot;The aftermath of the Fed meeting depends on sentiment towards future interest rate rises.&quot;</p>
<p>Key economic data due out next week include the Japan trade balance for January on Sunday, Italian May CPI on Tuesday and Wednesday, German April M3 over the course of the week and UK retail sales for April on Thursday.</p>
<p>UK retail sales were posted as an interesting figure but not market moving as the Bank of England has already raised interest rates recently. The next British focus will be Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's announcement of the date for his mini-budget -- the first one of the new Labour government.</p>
