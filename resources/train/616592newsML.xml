<title>AUSTRALIA: More voter support for Australian goods tax - poll.</title>
<headline>More voter support for Australian goods tax - poll.</headline>
<dateline>CANBERRA 1996-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian government's push for tax reform received a boost on Wednesday with another poll showing increasing voter support for a consumption tax.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald poll showed 68 percent of voters supported a conditional 15 percent Goods and Services tax (GST), up from 64 percent in the last poll in June 1996.</p>
<p>This is the second poll this week to show rising support for a GST as the government pushes the tax reform debate and refuses to rule out a GST if it wins a second term.  </p>
<p>On Monday, a poll in the Bulletin newsweekly magazine showed support for a GST rising to 59 percent from 56 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>The Herald's poll put opposition to a value-added tax at just 22 percent, down from 27 percent. The Bulletin's poll showed opposition falling to 31 percent from 37 percent.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello have pushed the need for tax reform in recent weeks and have refused to rule out imposing a GST if the Liberal-National government wins a second term in power.  </p>
<p>The coalition's plans for a GST are widely blamed for its failure to win the 1993 election. But it ousted the 13-year-old Labor government in 1996 after pledging not to implement a GST in its first three-year term.</p>
<p>The Herald poll found the proportion of voters who strongly supported a 15 percent GST, excluding foodstuffs, increased to 33 percent from 28 percent, while ordinary support slipped to 35 percent from 36 percent.</p>
<p>The number of voters who strongly opposed the tax fell to 10 percent from 14, while ordinary opposition fell to 12 percent from 13 percent.  </p>
<p>The Herald poll surveyed 2,065 voters around the country by telephone over the last weekend.</p>
