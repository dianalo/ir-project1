<headline>Analysts say interests match in Sega, Bandai merger.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-01-23</dateline>

<p>A mutual interest of survival in the increasingly competitive video game market brought gamemaker Sega Enterprises Ltd and toy manufacturer Bandai Co Ltd together, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;With the decreasing number of children and limited possible growth in the toy industry, Bandai is entering the game industry,&quot; said Masahiro Ono, analyst at Credit Lyonnaise Securities (Japan).</p>
<p>&quot;Sega, meanwhile, seems interested in the toy industry. It has planning ability, but lacks a way of circulating products,&quot; Ono said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bandai needs Sega's ability and know-how in the digital field, while Sega wants Bandai's characters to support its game contents. So each side's demands meet,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The two companies announced they were merging to form a new company, Sega-Bandai, effective October 1. In the deal, each Bandai share will be exchanged for 0.76 Sega shares, and Bandai will be dissolved after the transaction is completed.  </p>
<p>But some analysts said that they could not see what the deal would accomplish.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to see a merit in the merger,&quot; said Yasuo Imanaka, analyst at the Okasan Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>&quot;Both companies have problems in similar fields,&quot; he said, adding that Sega would have to find a way to gain ground that it has lost in the &quot;Sega Saturn&quot; game.</p>
<p>In December, Sega said that it had lowered its earnings forecast for the year to March 31, 1997, because it would get rid of its inventory of products related to its 16-bit machines and erase accumulated losses at its U.S. unit.  </p>
<p>Sega also said in December that it would dispose of 16-bit machine-related products, worth about seven billion yen worldwide.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the (new) firm can beat Sony's PlayStation in any way,&quot; Imanaka said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll wait and see how they (both firms) are going to get along with the problems after October 1,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Yutaka Sugiyama, analyst at UBS Securities Ltd, also said that the purpose of the merger was unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand the aim of the merger, but it would be easier for them to adjust their strategies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts also pointed out the difference in the two firms' corporate cultures.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus is how they cooperate with each other to unify their management policies,&quot; said Yasuaki Fujine, analyst at Smith Barney.  </p>
<p>Both firms have faced recent financial problems.</p>
<p>In December, Sega lowered its forecast for a net profit for 1996/97 by almost half to 5.3 billion yen from a November forecast of 10 billion yen, against its 1995/96 profit of 4.21 billion yen.</p>
<p>Bandai said earlier this month that it would post group net loss of nine billion yen in the year to March 31, 1997, against its previous forecast of a net profit of 10.50 billion yen. It posted a group net profit of 10.36 billion yen in 1995/96.</p>
