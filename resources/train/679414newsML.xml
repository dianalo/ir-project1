<p>Richard Krajicek dodged the rain showers to begin the defence of his Wimbledon title with a straight-sets win over German Marcello Craca on Monday.</p>
<p>Krajicek had only just set foot on court when rain, which teased the organisers throughout the first day of the championships, sent him back to the locker room. Another downpour interrupted his Centre Court match for 75 minutes in the third set but the fourth-seeded Dutchman shrugged off the delays, winning 7-6 6-2 6-4 after one hour 41 minutes of play.</p>
<p>Second seed Goran Ivanisevic sped through his first match so fast on Court Two, where play began earlier than on Centre Court, that he had no need to worry about the weather.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic beat Romanian Dinu Pescariu, ranked 106th in the world, 6-1 6-3 6-3 in just 64 minutes to leave him home and dry before many of his rivals had even picked up their rackets.</p>
<p>Tim Henman, who last year inflamed British hopes of the first home winner in the men's singles since 1936 when he reached the quarter-finals, ignited another spark when he defeated Canadian Daniel Nestor in his opening match.</p>
<p>To Henman fell the honour of baptising the new 11,000-seat Court One which was officially opened with a parade of former champions including Rod Laver, Margaret Court and Martina Navratilova.</p>
<p>Women's fourth seed Iva Majoli, the French Open champion but still a novice on grass, was relieved to get her first win at Wimbledon in three attempts. The Croat beat Argentina's Mariana Diaz Oliva 2-6 6-0 6-3.</p>
<p>&quot;When I won this match I was almost as happy as when I won the French Open,&quot; said Majoli. &quot;It was like a release.&quot;</p>
<p>There were first-round wins too for fifth seeded American Lindsay Davenport, who beat compatriot Tami Jones 5-7 6-2 6-2 and number 12 Irina Spirlea of Romania, who thrashed Slovak Henrieta Nagyova 6-1 6-0.</p>
<p>Krajicek, who won the Rosmalen grasscourt tournament on Sunday, said he was looking forward to a rest on Tuesday before facing world number 87 Andrei Pavel of Romania in the second round.</p>
<p>&quot;I have played five days in a row now so I am just going to go back tonight and have dinner and try to relax,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Krajicek, who won the first-set tiebreak 7-5 and then raced to a 4-0 lead in the second set, admitted the match had not been a classic.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the kind of matches that you just have to win and you don't look for beauty,&quot;he said. &quot;I felt pretty pressured as defending champion and I felt a little bit nervous but it was a great feeling to get through this match.&quot;</p>
<p>Rain returned in the early evening, forcing Briton Greg Rusedski off Centre Court after winning the first set against seventh-seeded Australian Mark Philippoussis on a tiebreak.</p>
<p>The match, between the two fastest servers on the tour, saw precious few rallies and is was not until the ninth game that Rusedski dropped a point on his serve.</p>
<p>Rusedski, who hit 11 aces in the set, won the tiebreak 8-6 on his fourth set point.</p>
<p>Former champion Michael Stich, making his farewell appearance at Wimbledon, was leading 1993 runner-up Jim Courier 6-5 on Court One when the rain reappeared.</p>
<p>Organisers were hoping to resume play later on Monday but said matches not yet on court would be postponed until Tuesday.</p>
