<p>Following are some of the leading stories in the Swedish papers on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- The recent speculation about a deal between S-E-Banken and Nordbanken, in which S-E-Banken would take over the international division and mutual funds operation from Nordbanken, would be less logical than a straight merger, a commentary said. Nordbanken, which was seen taking over the retail operations of S-E-Banken, would thereby become a second rate player on the Swedish banking market. Nordbanken on Sunday denied the speculation and said it was not close to reaching such a deal with S-E-Banken.</p>
<p>- This week's congress of European Social Democrats in Malmo, Sweden, expected to be attended by Britian's new prime minister Tony Blair, will show the European Union is made up of Social Democrats.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- Municipalities' costs for the record high unemployment problem is 10 billion crowns annually, with some six billion crowns going towards jobless on social welfare.</p>
<p>- The official accident report on the Estonia disaster in which almost 900 lives were lost in September 1994 will probably be delayed until the end of 1997, a Finnish member of the committee says.</p>
<p>DAGENS INDUSTRI</p>
<p>- Talks between Swedish commercial bank S-E-Banken and Nordbanken have hit a wall again. The two banks' boards had been in intensive negotiations all day Friday, a source told the newspaper.</p>
<p>- Vehicle maker AB Volvo will expand its financial services and loaning out money will become a key source of profits and at the same time it attracts customers. The risk for loan losses will also increase, however.</p>
