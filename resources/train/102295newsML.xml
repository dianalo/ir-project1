<headline>Brazil shares end higher on re-election prospects.</headline>
<dateline>SAO PAULO 1996-10-08</dateline>

<p>Brazilian stocks ended higher on rising volume due to the brightening outlook for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's re-election, growing optimism generally and a return of foreign investors, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The political-economic scenario is better so the market is entering a better phase,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;More foreigners are coming in.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index  .BVSP of 49 most traded shares rose 389 points, or 0.59 percent, to close at 66,516 points as turnover swelled to 525.3 million reais.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the market rose on improving prospects for Cardoso's plans to amend the constitution to allow him to run again in 1998, also boosting the outlook for his other proposed reforms.</p>
<p>They said out-going Sao Paulo mayor and power broker Paulo Maluf may not oppose re-election after high-level government officials announced they will back Maluf's hand-picked candidate in a November 15 mayoral runoff vote.</p>
<p>Dealers said foreign investors return to Brazilian shares, many seeking blue chip bargains and power sector shares, despite a lack of market news.  </p>
<p>Among the blue-chip gainers was bolsa benchmark Telebras preferred, which rose 0.73 percent to end at 82.40 reais. Its voting common rose 1.03 percent to 68.40 reais.</p>
<p>Other leaders ended mixed. Top blue chips losers included state oil monopoly Petrobras PET_.SA, off 1.21 percent at 122.50 reais and state miner Vale do Rio Doce preferred, down 0.47 percent at 21.00 reais.</p>
<p>Eletrobras continued its climb, rising 1.32 percent to end at 307.00 reais, amid a general buying spree of power-sector shares.  </p>
<p>The bolsa's Electrical Energy Index (IEE) of nine most-liquid power stocks closed 0.57 percent higher at 1,691 points, in line with the increase in the Bovespa index.</p>
<p>Brokers said volume and volatility should begin to increase in the coming days as investors begin speculating ahead of the October 16 futures expiration and October 21 options settlements.</p>
<p>The market on Tuesday, however, did not show signs of being hit by speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little early but it should be starting soon,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
