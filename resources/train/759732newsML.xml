<p>New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch said on Tuesday public service departments would remain constrained to finding funding for the cost of wage settlements from within their existing resources.</p>
<p>In a speech to a public sector management conference here, Birch said the coalition government intended to continue a stance adopted by the previous government &quot;of focusing on increasing productivity within funding limitations&quot;.  </p>
<p>&quot;Departments will not be compensated for the cost of wage settlements, and each chief executive is responsible for ensuring that the cost of these settlements can be met from with the department's existing baselines,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chief executives of departments would also be asked to ensure they achieved efficiency gains sufficient to meet any such increased costs &quot;and improve the contribution of the public sector to the New Zealand economy&quot;, Birch added.</p>
<p>In an atmosphere of increased emphasis on productivity, he noted that public sector pay structures had become more diverse and more closely linked to individual performance.  </p>
<p>Birch said that in terms of employment, the public sector accounted for 15.5 percent of the total workforce as at November 1996.</p>
<p>Personnel costs represented 10.7 percent of total sector expenses in 1995/96, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a collective responsibility to the crown and...to the economy as a whole, (for managers) to ensure that settlements are achieved within existing fiscal limits established by the government, while maintaining an efficient and effective service to the community,&quot; Birch went on.  </p>
<p>At a strategic level the government wanted to cut its total share of spending to below 30 percent of GDP from 35 percent.</p>
<p>Its current forecasts are for spending to fall to 33 percent by the end of its first term, due in late 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Achieving the long-term reduction will require ongoing firm management of expenses, clear priorities and a continuing focus on improving the quality of government spending to ensure value for money,&quot; Birch said.</p>
