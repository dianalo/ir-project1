<p>Short-term interbank rates fell as liquidity improved further due to the maturity of a 420 million ringgit long-term government bond issue, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the reaction to the maturity was muted because interbank rates have been declining in the last few days.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not that much room for rates to fall,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>He said Bank Negara, to maintain a tight monetary policy, could intervene in the interbank market if rates fell sharply.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 6.50/80 percent against 6.80/7.00 on Tuesday, two-week at 7.00/10 percent against 7.10/20 and three-week at 7.10/20 percent against 7.10/25.</p>
<p>One-month money at 7.20/25 percent, three-month at 7.25/30 percent and six-month at 7.30/35 percent, were all steady.</p>
<p>Dealers said the overnight rate, which closed at 5.8/6.0 percent on Tuesday, was expected to remain unchanged.</p>
<p>They said the interbank rates were expected to fall further as more funds were expected to come in. On Friday, there is a maturity of 500 million ringgit in Bank Negara bills.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably in anticipation of those maturities, people are holding back, waiting for rates to fall further,&quot; said a dealer with another Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were mixed, futures dealers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) June contract was down two points at 92.66, or an implied yield of 7.34 percent.</p>
<p>But, September was steady at 92.67, or 7.32 percent, and December up one at 92.66, or 7.34 percent.</p>
