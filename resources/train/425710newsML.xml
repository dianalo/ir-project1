<p>Moscow stepped up a probe into possible crime in its giant aluminium industry on Friday, just as a major Western force in the Russian metals sector launched a defence of its role.</p>
<p>A highly-public rown between Moscow and London-based Trans-World Group, which has a big presence in Russian smelting -- has raised questions over whether Russia might jeopardise metal supplies to markets.</p>
<p>But analysts played down the possibility of disruption to supplies from Russia, which is the world's single largest exporter of refined aluminium.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not likely to be any impact on aluminium exports,&quot; one London analyst said.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Russia's Prosecutor General's press office on Friday as saying it was activating an investigation, originally started by the Interior Ministry, into what it called crimes in the aluminium sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The pace of the investigation was discussed at a special operative conference at the Prosecutor General's office,&quot; the office said. &quot;Concrete written instructions aimed at activating the investigation were given on this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Trans-World Group is the biggest single foreign investor in the Russian aluminium industry. It said hours before the probe announcement that it was putting its investments on hold until the Russian government clarified its position.</p>
<p>The group's anxieties rose last month when Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said that domestic aluminum plants should be protected from Western firms and that imports of raw materials to make metal should carry tariffs.</p>
<p>The Prosecutor General's announcement came just as Trans-World began a public defence of its Russian activities, taking out full-page advertisements in international newspapers saying that it was being smeared.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, they're (the authorities and Trans-World) still talking to each other,&quot; said anothr metals analyst. &quot;But it's obviously a development that needs to be watched.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia accounted for a major proportion of world primary aluminium exports last year, delivering 2.44 million tonnes to the market out of total output of 2.87 million.</p>
<p>Trans-World told reporters in New York earlier this week that it was determined to protect its minority shareholdings in Russian aluminum plants from Moscow's protectionist overtures.</p>
<p>David and Simon Reuben, the two brothers at the head of Trans-World, spoke of &quot;orchestrated campaigns&quot; against them, anti-semitism, attempted blackmail, KGB complicity with detractors seeking to keep Trans-World out of Russia and shifting power alliances in Russian politics.</p>
<p>The company also rejected allegations that it had defrauded the Russian Central Bank and that the death of three bankers was linked to Trans-World's efforts to wrest back a 29 percent stake in the Krasnoyarsk smelter in Siberia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely legal and extremely above board,&quot; David Reuben, Trans-World's executive chairman, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said that if Moscow closed the door on Trans-World, a major supplier of raw materials to Russian smelters would be removed.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose they could be shut out completely, which would threaten raw material supplies,&quot; the first analyst said.</p>
<p>In a process known as tolling, Trans-World imports raw materials into Russia's, pays its smelters to process the material and then exports the refined metal.</p>
<p>While Russian aluminium executives concede that years of tolling saved the industry from collapse in the early years of market economy reforms, many now complain it robs the smelters of much-needed hard-currency export earnings.</p>
<p>Russian industry officials have echoed Kulikov's remarks, saying they are upset at the thought of foreign tolling companies creaming hard currency profits from domestic assets.</p>
