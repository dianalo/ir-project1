<p>Drivers are likely to see lower prices at the gas pump this summer compared with last year, thanks to lower crude oil prices, U.S. energy officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This year we don't see a lot of sticker shock,&quot; said Jay Hakes, chief of the Energy Information Administration.</p>
<p>Last summer, gasoline prices jumped 21 cents a gallon across the country and even more in California as crude oil prices surged by $5 a barrel ahead of the summer driving season.</p>
<p>This summer, with more crude oil available to refiners, Hakes said pump prices would likely climb only 3 cents to 5 cents from current levels to an average of $1.31 per gallon for all grades during the summer, about 1.5 cents less than last summer's average.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe motorists this spring will not be seeing the kind of price shocks that they saw last spring,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices are expected to peak at $1.34 in June, below last summer's high of $1.38 in May, according to the EIA, an independent agency within the Energy Department.</p>
<p>&quot;While prices are not low by historic standards, they should be less volatile,&quot; Hakes said.</p>
<p>Driving 7.3 billion miles daily, U.S. motorists will guzzle 342 million gallons of gasoline every day this year, which is 1.9 percent more gasoline than last year fuelling 2.7 percent more mileage, according to the agency.</p>
<p>Hakes said refinery production and imports should be able to keep up with Americans' appetite for gasoline without drawing on stocks, which are below normal for this time of year.</p>
<p>U.S. and European refiners are well-positioned to produce a lot of gasoline rapidly, he said, because the mild winter earlier this year depressed oil demand and allowed them to do repair work at their plants well ahead of the driving season.</p>
<p>But consumer advocates Citizen Action questioned whether refineries could really pump at the high levels that the EIA said they would have to average over the summer.</p>
<p>When &quot;you make that (supply) up by cranking up refineries to 96 percent average -- you have things like refineries going down,&quot; said Ed Rothschild, Citizen Action's energy policy director.</p>
<p>The EIA itself warned that prices could top last summer's levels if an accident shut down a refinery or exports from Europe failed to come to the United States for any reason.</p>
<p>According to Hakes, inventory levels were &quot;the most negative of the indicators at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that stock levels were &quot;probably not ringing a lot of alarm bells right now&quot; among lawmakers as they did last year, when politicians pressed the Energy Department to make refiners store more gasoline to prevent a supply shock.</p>
<p>&quot;This is certainly something we plan to track in the coming months,&quot; he said.</p>
