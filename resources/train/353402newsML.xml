<p>Italian coach Cesare Maldini has made two changes to his squad for Italy's World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley on February 12.</p>
<p>Enrico Chiesa and Real Madrid defender Christian Panucci come into the 21-man squad after failing to be selected for Maldini's first senior Italian outing, a 2-0 friendly win against Northern Ireland in Palermo last month.</p>
<p>Panucci was left out last time because he had only recently transferred from AC Milan to Spain.</p>
<p>Winner of 19 caps in the Italy Under 21 side coached by Maldini, Panucci has a better chance than Chiesa of making the first team against England.</p>
<p>With Juventus defender Ciro Ferrara in the libero position, Panucci could line out at right back instead of Angelo Di Livio and alongside Alessandro Costacurta, Paolo Maldini and Antonio Benarrivo in defence.</p>
<p>Chiesa, scorer of a spectacular winner in Parma's 1-0 victory over Piacenza on Sunday, is widely considered one of the most talented Italian strikers of the moment.</p>
<p>Scorer of 22 goals for Sampdoria last season, Chiesa was bought last summer by Parma for $15 million dollars in the biggest Italian transfer deal of the year.</p>
<p>Despite his call up, Chiesa is unlikely to start against England where Maldini's will probably prerwe a strike force of Pierluigi Casiraghi of Lazio alongside Gianfranco Zola of English club Chelsea.</p>
<p>Chiesa or Middlesbrough's Fabrizio Ravanelli or Alessandro Del Piero of Juventus could be brought on as substitute in attack.</p>
<p>In midfield Demetrio Albertini, Dino Baggio and Chelsea's Roberto Di Matteo look the obvious first choices with Di Livio a possible substitute for Di Matteo later in the game.</p>
<p>Maldini was appointed Italian coach only last December following the resignation of his predecessor Arrigo Sacchi and Italy's disappointing showing at last year's European championship.</p>
<p>He has said that in view of the Wembley World Cup qualifier there would not be time for experiments in team selection.</p>
<p>Apart from Chiesa and Panucci, the only difference between the squad named on Tuesday and that of last month was the injury-enforced exclusion of AC Milan midfielder Stefano Eranio.</p>
