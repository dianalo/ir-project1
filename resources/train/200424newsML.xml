<p>Following are reactions to a report by Statistics Canada that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in October, or 1.8 percent year over year.</p>
<p>Economists had forecast, on average, that CPI would rise 0.1 percent in October or 1.5 percent year over year.</p>
<p>MICHAEL GREGORY, AN ECONOMIST AND STRATEGIST WITH LEHMAN BROTHERS: &quot;On balance, it was kind of a mixed result for the market -- a little bit better than expected on one side, a little bit worse than expected on the other, with no implications for Bank of Canada policy. Basically inflation remains very subdued.&quot;  </p>
<p>DOUG PORTER, SENIOR ECONOMIST WITH NESBITT BURNS: &quot;The headline number is a little bit disappointing given that it's somewhat higher than expectations, but I think the important point here is that excluding food and energy there's still no sign of any underlying inflation pressure whatsoever.&quot;  </p>
<p>ANDREW SPENCE, SENIOR ECONOMIST WITH DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL: &quot;The increase in energy prices drove up the all items rate higher than expected to a year-over-year rate of 1.8 percent. However I have to admit that with core inflation unchanged in the month, disinflation pressures seem to be a little more intense than I'd anticipated.</p>
<p>&quot;I think so long as the exchange rate looks a little bit unsteady here there's no implication for the immediate conduct of (Bank of Canada) policy from this report.&quot;</p>
