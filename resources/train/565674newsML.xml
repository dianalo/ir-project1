<p>First National Bank Holdings shares remained weak on Wednesday after the release of interim results which came in below expectations, traders said.</p>
<p>The bank lifted headline earnings per share in the six months to March to 110.4 cents a share from 103.5 cents while analysts polled by Reuters expected consensus earnings at 112.0 cents.</p>
<p>Managing director Viv Bartlett expected the group to post a solid improvement in headline earnings in the second half but some market players were sceptical.</p>
<p>&quot;Their results are below expectations. The bank says it will show an improvement in the second half but we will have to see that better performance first,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The share remained 20 cents down at 31.70 rand, the level it was at before the release of its results. Volumes traded were worth just over four million rand.</p>
<p>Bartlett said in a statement the bank was on track with its strategy of distinct market segmentation, improved service levels and reduced operating cost ratios.</p>
<p>&quot;We have full confidence that the restructuring initiatives under way will firmly position the First National Bank Group for future growth,&quot; he said.</p>
