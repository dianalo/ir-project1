<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--The far-left Unity List and far-right Danish Peoples and Progress parties - the extremes of the Danish political spectrum - have formed an alliance to campaign for a 'no' to the European Union's Amsterdam Treaty reforms at next year's referendum in Denmark.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--A new Gallup poll shows that only two out of three Danish Conservative voters will vote in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty. In 1994, 88 percent of Danish Conservatives were positive about Danish EU membership. &quot;The situation is serious. The EU referendum is the most important political challenge of the next six months,&quot; Conservative parliamentary group leader Hans Engell said.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS-POSTEN</p>
<p>--Danish and western insurance companies are poised to move into Poland, where local insurers are under great pressure due to the flooding disaster.</p>
<p>--Danes are borrowing money as never before to buy housing, despite steep rises in property prices, giving rise to fears of government intervention, according to new mortgage credit data.</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--Danes have never been so materially rich in their entire history. Since 1993, every Dane has on average increased his wealth by 200,000 crowns and the outlook for even greater prosperity remains rosy, scoring extra points for the incumbent Social Democrat-led coalition up to general elections to be held in Denmark in September 1998 at the latest.</p>
