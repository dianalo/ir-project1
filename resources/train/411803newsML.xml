<p>The Indian government proposed slashing corporate and personal income taxes on Friday with a new budget plan that sent stock prices soaring.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram presented the government's budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year starting on April 1, saying the blueprint would cut red ink while spurring growth.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark index surged more than six percent after Chidambaram announced that the government planned to reduce the tax on domestic corporations to 35 percent from 40 percent, and abolish a tax on dividends.</p>
<p>At 7:33 p.m. (1403 GMT), the exchange's benchmark index was up 221.11 points, or 6.36 percent, at 3,695.90 points.</p>
<p>Chidambaram also proposed scrapping a 7.5 percent surcharge on corporations. He also said the budget, which must be approved by parliament, would cut personal income tax rates across the board and bring down the maximum rate to 30 percent from 40.</p>
<p>&quot;This will lead to a sea change in tax compliance,&quot; said K.S. Mehata, a senior member of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the budget is truly path-breaking,&quot; Uday Kotak, head of investment bank Kotak Mahindra, said in Bombay.</p>
<p>Ashish Kacholi, head of research at Prime Securities in Bombay, said: &quot;I think it is a landmark budget. He (Chidambaram) is continuing the process of reform. The market will take this very positively, extremely bullishly.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget plan would extend the tax net, currently limited to only about 12 million of India's 936 million citizens, by imposing new levies on owners of cars and telephones, considered luxury goods.</p>
<p>In a surprise announcement, Chidambaram said the fiscal deficit as a share of gross domestic procut (GDP) -- considered a barometre of the economy's overall health -- would drop to 5.0 percent in the 1996/97 financial year ending on March 31.</p>
<p>That would be a larger-than-expected drop from 5.8 percent in the preceding fiscal year. Analysts had expected the fiscal deficit to be between 5.1 and 5.4 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Vowing to continue on the path of financial prudence, Chidambaram said the 15-party centre-left government which took office last June aimed to cut the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP in the next financial year starting on April 1.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a path-breaking and market friendly budget with a number of incentives for the corporate sector,&quot; said Girish Desai, head of research at Prabhdas Lilladher in Bombay.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally feel the market is in for a bull run.&quot;</p>
<p>The centre-left government's political opponents were unenthused but guarded in their criticism.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation will increase,&quot; said Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former prime minister and leader of the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing about poverty or village or joblessness that they have been talking about so much,&quot; said BJP deputy Pramod Mahajan.</p>
<p>Former finance minister Pranab Mukherjee of the Congress party, which gives make-or-break support to Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's government, said: &quot;I think the finance minister has done a clever job.&quot;</p>
