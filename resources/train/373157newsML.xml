<headline>ITT board rejects Hilton offer.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>ITT Corp said Wednesday its board rejected Hilton Hotels Corp's offer to acquire it for about $6.5 billion, or $55 per share, calling the offer inadequate and not in the best interests of ITT shareholders.</p>
<p>ITT, in a press statement, said keeping the company independent would be in the best interests of its shareholders, and it would review various options to increase the company's value.  </p>
<p>Among those options are &quot;monetizing or otherwise realizing the value of ITT's non-core assets,&quot; ITT said in the statement. Officials from the company were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>ITT said in the press statement that it would file counterclaims to litigation filed by Hilton.  It is also seeking to enjoin the Hilton offer, ITT said, because of what it alleged was Hilton's &quot;misappropriation and misuse of confidential ITT information.&quot;  </p>
<p>ITT said included in that information was news obtained in violation of a 1996 confidentiality agreement between it and Bally Entertainment, which is now owned by Hilton.</p>
<p>ITT's stock closed Wednesday at 56, after rising from the low 40s on January 27 -- the day Hilton made its offer to acquire ITT for $6.5 billion in cash and stock, and assume $4 billion of debt.</p>
<p>ITT said it intends to focus on its gaming and lodging businesses by building the Sheraton and Caesars brands.  </p>
<p>Jim Gallagher, a spokesman for ITT, declined to comment further or to say whether ITT would seek to sell assets which it considered to be non-core.</p>
<p>Such non-core assets include Madison Square Garden, ITT World Directories and ITT Educational Services, ITT said in its press statement.</p>
<p>ITT said Hilton had previously filed litigation against it in Nevada Federal Court.  ITT said it is seeking to make Hilton disclose information about the acquisition offer required under federal securities laws.</p>
