<text>
<p>CME live cattle futures remained mostly lower at the close while feeder cattle rebounded on short covering to end higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.400 cent per lb lower to 0.150 higher with August off 0.125 at 67.525 cents. Feeder cattle finished 0.300 to 0.050 higher after trading lower early with August up 0.225 at 81.350 cents.</p>
<p>Profit taking weighed on August to offset firm cash market support while commercial position rolling weighed on back months. Buying of August and selling of October continued at the close, traders said.</p>
<p>Cash cattle prices held strong after trading $2 per cwt higher this week and cash beef prices were seen climbing further the next couple of weeks as retailers stock up for the next holiday, Labor Day, to be observed on September 1, traders said.</p>
<p>Boxed beef values have already risen to best levels since early December, basis the heavy-weight choice quote, during the last week, according to USDA figures.</p>
<p>Heavy-weight choice rose to $108.61 per cwt at midday.</p>
<p>R.J. O'Brien notably sold August and bought October at the close, traders said.</p>
<p>Commission house short covering limited the loss in August. RBH and ING bought October early, pit sources said.  </p>
<p>In live cattle options, commission houses sold August 66 and 68 calls early and sold August 67 puts and 68 calls late, pit sources added.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures rallied from early losses on short covering following a paring of gains in corn futures. However, gains were limited by continued concern over feed costs and lower prices in live cattle futures, traders said.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was off $0.18 at $82.38 per cwt.</p>
<p>R.J. O'Brien was a notable buyer early with LFG, E.D.&amp;F. Man and ADM Investor Services late buyers, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Boneless beef and trimmings futures ended mostly lower after paring losses late. Hedgers pressured boneless beef down to speculative support, traders said.</p>
<p>Spreaders bought October trimmings and sold December boneless beef while Rosenthal Collins sold October trimmings, traders said. RBH bought back month trimmings and Lind-Waldock sold back months in both trimmings and boneless beef. Iowa Grain bought August boneless beef, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Boneless beef closed 1.60 cent per lb lower to unchanged with August off 0.70 at 102.30 cents. Trimmings ended up 0.10 to off 3.00 with only August up at 46.60 cents.</p>
