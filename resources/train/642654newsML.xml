<p>Zambia, where 500 people a day catch the HIV virus that can cause AIDS, said on Friday it expects the disease will have orphaned some 600,000 children by the year 2000.</p>
<p>A Health Ministry spokesman said 80,000 to 100,000 AIDS-related deaths would be recorded annually over the next few years in the southern African country of nine million people.</p>
<p>&quot;The steep rise in adult mortality in specific age groups will have in immense impact on the situation of children,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;From an assumed 70,000 AIDS-orphaned children in 1993, the prospect by the end of the decade is that Zambia will have between 530,000 and 600,000 AIDS orphans.&quot;</p>
<p>About half of the currently orphaned children had lost their fathers, a quarter their mothers and a quarter had lost both parents to AIDS, an official study showed.</p>
<p>Zambia is one of the countries worst hit by AIDS, with around 34 percent of the sexually active population in urban areas HIV positive, and 13 percent in rural areas.</p>
