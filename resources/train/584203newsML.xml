<title>BELGIUM: Deal reached on EU part-time work.</title>

<p>European Union labour and employers groups reached agreement on Wednesday on rules to guarantee rights to part-time workers.</p>
<p>UNICE, the EU employer's federation, said in a statement that it had completed negotiations on the new rules with ETUC, the trades union group, and CEEP, the public employers group.</p>
<p>The three groups agreed last June to open talks on rights for part-time workers after the European Commission asked them to consider ways of ensuring that employees in a broad range of flexible jobs did not face discrimination.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty's social protocol gives these groups -- the so-called social partners -- the right to strike a deal and then ask the EU Council of Ministers to turn it into EU law.</p>
<p>At UNICE's insistence, the negotiations have been confined solely to part-time work and have not covered other types of flexible jobs such as fixed-term or temporary contracts.</p>
<p>The statement gave no details of the agreement, which will be formally adopted on June 6.</p>
<p>It said the rules were designed to remove discrimination against part-time work and facilitate its development.</p>
