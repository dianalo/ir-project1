<p>New York State's battle over rent rules that mainly affect New York City Wednesday stayed deadlocked over vacancy decontrol, the key issue, but the Senate backed down on letting gays inherit apartments.</p>
<p>Under vacancy decontrol, landlords would be able to charge free-market rates for apartments once tenants moved out. Gov George Pataki's proposal aims to protect the present tenants from being driven out of their apartments by creating civil and criminal penalities for landlords who harrassed tenants.</p>
<p>Apartment rent regulations expire on Sunday, and the battle over them has bogged down the state's efforts to get a new budget, which was due on April 1, and approve a new welfare bill, which has to be completed by July 1 for the state to get its federal grant.</p>
<p>But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, who wants the present system left intact, has rejected vacancy decontrol, saying the policy failed when it was tried from 1971 to 1974.</p>
<p>He has called the difference between vacancy decontrol and letting the rules expire the difference between a sudden and a &quot;rather rapid death.&quot; Tenant advocates have said that under vacancy decontrol, New York City's rent-regulated apartments might be returned to the free-market system in about eight years.</p>
<p>The Republican governor dismissed a New York Times poll, released in the Wednesday edition, which found that Pataki's approval rating had fallen 10 percentage points in just three months to 31 percent. The paper said that while there could be other reasons for the fall, no other issues in the period would seem to explain it. At least 70 percent of the 913 people polled said rent rules were needed to provide affordable housing and prevent rents from soaring.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't make a policy based on polls. You do what you believe is right for the people of the state, and I believe that the plan that I've advanced is right for the people of New York City and New York State,&quot; Pataki told reporters in Albany after a news conference.</p>
<p>The Executive Director of the New York Tenant and Neighbor Coalition, Bill Easton, faulted the governor for not addressing how vacancy decontrol would affect the housing market. &quot;It's clear that he thinks his plan protects tenants but he refuses to debate the centerpiece of his proposal,&quot; he told reporters. Pataki's proposal does not use the term vacancy decontrol.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Troy, who has taken the toughest stand on eliminating apartment rent rules, stressed his flexibility, noted he now was willing to accept a longer phase-out period than he first proposed.</p>
<p>&quot;But the governor has intervened, my members in the city have helped me understand that if we can phase the program out over the next 10 years, 20 years, 25 years, slowly...that's better than what they consider to be suddenly in two years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Republican Senator, who wanted to limit the rights of tenants to will apartments to their immediate family, said he was prepared to accede to demands that domestic partners, including gays, continue to enjoy the same rights they now do. However, he would limit the right to will an apartment by making this a one-time event.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been talking to the governor, I've been talking to our members, and they've been making a heavy case that we should be including domestic partners because they have an interest, whether it's heterosexual or homosexual, and I'm open to that.&quot; He added he expected this expanded protection to be included in the Senate's own version of a bill.</p>
<p>And Bruno also backed down on his first proposal to deregulate apartments for the well-to-do, raising the allowed income level for tenants to $175,000--the same amount suggested by the governor--from the $125,000 limit, he had wanted. Bruno also agreed to Pataki's plans to impose criminal sanctions for landlords found to have harrassed tenants and to require tentants to put rent money in escrow accounts with the Housing Court if proceedings to collect rent were delayed.</p>
<p>Talks between the governor, the Senate Majority Leader, and the Assembly Speaker were not scheduled to resume until Friday at 1000 EDT as Silver was observing a two-day religious holiday that runs from sundown on Tuesday until sundown on Thursday. Bruno said there would be staff meetings in the interim.</p>
