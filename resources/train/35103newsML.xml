<p>Space shuttle Atlantis, whose launch was delayed by the approach of Hurricane Fran, will lift off before dawn on Sept. 16, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said on Thursday.</p>
<p>NASA managers approved Atlantis' return to the launch pad complex very early on Thursday morning, just one day after the shuttle was forced into its hangar by fears that Fran might strike central Florida.</p>
<p>But Hurricane Fran headed north past Florida, and on Thursday was threatening landfall along the Carolina coast.</p>
<p>The delay extended by two days the stay in space of Shannon Lucid, a U.S. astronaut who has been working aboard the orbiting Russian Mir space station since March. Lucid, a biochemist and 53-year-old mother of three, was originally due home in early August.</p>
<p>But that return was put off for six weeks because of problems with the shuttle's booster rockets.</p>
<p>Atlantis is now set to lift off to retrieve Lucid at 4:54 a.m. EDT (0854 GMT) on Sept. 16 on a mission that would conclude on Sept. 26 with a landing at the Kennedy Space Centre.</p>
