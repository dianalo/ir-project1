<p>The shooting of a gangland boss in an Istanbul society cafe gave Turkey's racy media a welcome diversion from 11 months of dreary political and economic news.</p>
<p>&quot;The bloody face of the mafia!&quot; screamed Milliyet daily on Thursday. &quot;Dirty business&quot; shrieked Hurriyet.</p>
<p>&quot;Bloody street show,&quot; said normally sedate Yeni Yuzyil above front-page pictures of bodies and a step-by-step cartoon guide to the shooting of mobster Tevfik Agansoy.</p>
<p>Newly-widowed Hulya Agansoy grabbed her share of headlines, vowing to kill a rival mobster blamed for her husband's murder:</p>
<p>&quot;They will find his carcass among the rubbish,&quot; she told Yeni Yuzyil. &quot;We will not give up chasing that queer until our race dies out.&quot;</p>
<p>Turkish newspaper headlines have been dominated since September 1995 by monotonous wrangling and personal slanging-matches of political leaders trying to replace the collapsed coalition of then prime minister Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>Relieved at the change of agenda, newspapers competed for the most sensational version and blodiest pictures of the killing early on Wednesday of Agansoy and three others, including an off-duty bodyguard of Ciller, now foreign minister.</p>
<p>Page after page of pictures, graphics, and interviews sidelined the saga of the new Islamist-led government's first steps and the latest state of Turkey's high inflation economy.</p>
<p>The only other story that got a look-in involved claims that policemen had last month killed Turkey's &quot;casino king&quot;, Lutfu Topal, accompanied by bloody pictures of Topal dead in his car.</p>
<p>Television channels tripped over each other to get exclusive interviews with Hulya Agansoy or to report victorious mobile phone calls by the man suspected of masterminding the killing.</p>
<p>&quot;Let people leave us alone. Let it end here,&quot; he told private ATV channel. &quot;The business is done as we said. I slept well last night for the first time,&quot; he said in Hurriyet.</p>
<p>In his call to ATV, the gang leader -- a fugitive from the Turkish police and living abroad -- promised future &quot;striking announcements&quot; to brighten up the media.</p>
<p>Trying to introduce a higher tone, some columnists tut-tutted that the incident could happen just metres (yards) from a police station in Istanbul's posh Bebek district.</p>
