<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan central bank leaves money policy unchanged.</title>

<p>Taiwan's central bank board agreed in a meeting on Thursday to leave its monetary policy unchanged, pledging to maintain a stable-to-loose policy, central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will maintain our stable-to-loose monetary policy,&quot; Sheu told reporters after a meeting of the bank's board.</p>
<p>&quot;If liquidity remains loose we will conduct open market operations,&quot; Sheu said.</p>
<p>The central bank has maintained a similar monetary policy for weeks, trying to strike a balance that keeps interest rates low enough to stimulate the flagging economy without undermining the interests of bank depositors.  </p>
<p>Sheu encouraged other government departments to work with the central bank in a concerted effort to stimulate investment, saying the bank could not do this alone.</p>
<p>&quot;The current slow economy is not something that can be solved solely by central bank monetary policy,&quot; Sheu said. &quot;We need the cooperation of other agencies in order to boost investment incentive.&quot;  </p>
<p>Sheu and other bank officials said repeatedly in October, including after an October 19 board meeting, that liquidity in the banking system had become &quot;slightly too loose&quot; but that the bank would maintain an &quot;appropriately loose&quot; monetary policy.</p>
<p>This meant preventing interest rates from dropping too low so as not to hurt the interests of most depositors, officials have said, cautioning that monetary policy was no cure-all for the economy.  </p>
<p>Five consecutive reductions in commercial banks' reserve requirements between mid-1995 and August 1996 had made money more accessible but failed to ignite investment, central bank officials have said.</p>
