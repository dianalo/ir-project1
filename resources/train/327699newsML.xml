<p>Troops killed at least 50 civilians in northwest Rwanda during a crackdown this week after the killing of three Spanish aid workers, local residents and aid sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rwandan Vice-President Major-General Paul Kagame in Kigali told the British Broadcasting Corporation 80 people were killed in army search operations in Ruhengeri prefecture in the northwest and any civilian dead among them had been caught in crossfire.  </p>
<p>&quot;Rwandan soldiers shot 20 civilians to death at six o'clock in the evening on Tuesday behind the communal office in Kigombe,&quot; Theogene Buradiyo, secretary at the communal office in neighbouring Mukingo in Ruhengeri prefecture, told reporters. &quot;Rwandan soldiers have been hitting the local population hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Aid sources in Ruhengeri quoted local eyewitnesses as saying more than 30 civilians were killed by Rwandan troops in Mukingo on Wednesday afternoon. They said they feared the final toll from the army operation in Ruhengeri would be much higher than 50.</p>
<p>At Runigi church, 12 km (seven miles) southwest of Ruhengeri, Father Samuel Nayigiziki said eight to 10 people were killed by unidentified gunmen in the hills behind Nkuli village on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The army launched a crackdown after suspected Hutu militiamen killed three Spanish aid workers in Ruhengeri in cold blood in Ruhengeri on Saturday night.</p>
