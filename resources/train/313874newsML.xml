<p>Guatemala and China on Wednesday held secret talks in an effort to repair the effects of Beijing's veto that barred U.N. observers from monitoring a peace pact in the Central American country, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Diplomats, saying China had requested the talks, reported that the discussions would continue on Thursday although they did not expect immediate results to undo Beijing's negative vote in the Security Council.</p>
<p>The 14 other council members last Friday all supported sending 155 military observers to Guatemala for three months to monitor the U.N.-brokered peace agreements that ended more than three decades of civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;Our door is always open,&quot; said Chen Ranfeng, China's U.N. spokesman, in reference to discussions with Guatemala.</p>
<p>China has objected to Guatemala's ties to Taiwan, its support of moves to get U.N. membership for Taipei and its invitation to Taiwan's foreign minister John Chang to attend the peace accord signing ceremonies on Dec. 29.</p>
<p>Beijing, which exercised its first veto in nearly 25 years, would like Guatemala to apologize for the invitation to Chang, as well as not support Taiwan's bid for U.N. membership, diplomats said.</p>
<p>China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that will one day be reunited with the motherland.</p>
<p>Diplomats said there were three alternatives to fulfill the Guatemalan peace accords. They were:</p>
<p>-- to resubmit the issue to the Security Council should China and Guatemala reach any understanding.</p>
<p>-- to have Mexico ask the General Assembly, which originally sent the current 500-strong U.N. human rights monitoring mission to Guatemala, to approve the military observers also. But the United States was said to be anxious not to set a precedent by having the Third World-dominated assembly override Security Council actions. And China, which considers itself a champion of the developing world, did not want to be embarrassed by losing a vote in the assembly, the envoys said.</p>
<p>-- to ask the Organization of American States (OAS) to field the observers under its auspices. But envoys said the OAS was reluctant to undertake anything related to military activities, sensitive to past U.S. armed action in the region. They also said all factions in Guatemala preferred the United Nations as the accords stated.</p>
<p>The issue has been discussed almost daily among the so-called &quot;friends of Guatemala&quot; who have been helping the United Nations in the peace process. They are the United States, Mexico, Spain, Colombia, Norway and Venezuela.</p>
<p>China raised similar objections last year when it balked at renewing a later U.N. peacekeeping force in Haiti.</p>
<p>After holding the Haiti operation hostage for several days, China finally relented and voted for a scaled-down compromise and a Chinese diplomatic delegation visited Haiti last July for the first time in 40 years.</p>
<p>One senior Western diplomat said he suspected China became emboldened on the Taiwan issue in the United Nations since the last Haiti resolution, mainly because South Africa late last year announced its intention to break diplomatic ties to Taiwan and recognize Beijing.</p>
