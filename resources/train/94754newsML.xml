<p>BHP Copper boss Burgess Winter expects to slash up to ten U.S. cents a pound off production costs at its troubled Magma operations before the middle of next year and anticipates a rapid rise in the global price of copper in the next six months.</p>
<p>Winter, BHP Copper's Executive General Manager, told Reuters the price of copper &quot;should be&quot; around US$1.15 per pound rather than its current range of around 88-89 cents.</p>
<p>He predicted it would rise to well over the US$1.00 level in the next six months en-route to settling around $1.10-1.15.  </p>
<p>Magma, the second largest copper producer in the world, was purchased by Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP) earlier this year for US$2.4 billion. It lost money for BHP, one of the largest listed companies in Australia, in the 1996/97 first quarter (June/August) -- a result which shocked the local share market and sent BHP's share price tumbling.</p>
<p>BHP has been badly bruised by the slump in copper prices, stimulated in part by the Sumitomo trading scandal which emerged mid-year and slashed copper prices by more than 25 per cent.  </p>
<p>Shareholder anxiety about Magma's value to BHP was exacerbated when the BHP annual meeting heard last month that production costs at Arizona-based Magma had jumped to 85 U.S. cents a pound, compared with 68 cents when the takeover was completed in January.</p>
<p>Winter described the 68 cent figure as &quot;misleading&quot; but admitted 85 cents was &quot;a little high&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking at taking ten cents a pound off, certainly by the middle of next year,&quot; he said in a telephone interview from BHP's North American headquarters in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>He said production problems, including a design flaw which is being overcome at one of the company's new Nevada mines and temporarily inflated charges for smelting and refining Magma copper, had contributed to the cost problem.</p>
<p>Winter maintained Magma's integration with BHP had gone smoothly and the company was poised to reap the benefit when the market &quot;inevitably&quot; turned around.</p>
<p>BHP has other major copper operations at the Escondida mine in Chile and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea.  </p>
<p>Winter suggested further expansion in Chile and North America was likely and testing on a huge Argentine orebody was progressing well.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the metal of the next century, the fundamentals of copper are just so strong it has to be enormously successful,&quot; he said, noting &quot;producers don't have any inventory these days and ... consumers can't get any copper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we could see a significant increase in the copper price in the next six months - when I say significant I mean (to) well over a (U.S.) dollar a pound.&quot;  </p>
<p>He predicted the effects of the Sumitomo trading scandal would be through the market in the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at history, the prices of copper right now, I believe should be of the order of $1.15 a pound.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason it's not, is not clear but part of it may be the Sumitomo debacle.&quot;</p>
<p>Winter said &quot;the market is absolutely crazy&quot; but he predicted a bright time for the copper business in the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;Business is going great guns,&quot; he said.</p>
