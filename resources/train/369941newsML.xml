<text>
<p>ARA fuel oil bunkers swung back from initial peaks on Tuesday, while prices in the rest of Europe were mixed, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST was quoted at $99/100 fob at the end of the day after the barge market drew back from an early trade of $101 fob ARA and gained a little from the lowest deal.</p>
<p>Some traders said refinery supply was becoming tight. Others said such comments were designed to cloud a market which was not reacting to fundamentals.</p>
<p>After a reasonable rush of business on Monday, enquiries dried up.</p>
<p>Enquiries built up slightly from mid-afternoon, but total traded volume only reached around 5,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were lower at around $101/$104 fob. Business, as in Rotterdam, was slack.</p>
<p>Mediterranean prices were mixed, with gains in France and price falls in Italy. Prices held steady in Spain.</p>
<p>Trading was thin in all ports.</p>
