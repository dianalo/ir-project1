<p>A Turkish actor faces up to three years in jail for reciting a passage of Franz Kafka's novel &quot;The Trial&quot; in court to judges trying him for deliberately flouting freedom of expression laws, a newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Demokrasi newspaper said Mahir Gunsiray appeared in an Istanbul court on Thursday accused of &quot;insulting the bench&quot; for reading aloud a section of the Czech's novel in a State Security Court in May, the paper said.</p>
<p>The book details the nightmarish journey through a repressive legal system of an ordinary man who is never aware of the charges against him.</p>
<p>Gunsiray had originally been on trial with almost 100 other people who had published a banned book to draw attention to Turkey's harsh freedom of expression laws. That trial is continuing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Turkish legal system has been turned into a comedy,&quot; Demokrasi quoted him as saying. The paper said Gunsiray also quoted Don Quixote's self-effacing companion Sancho Panza in his defence on Thursday. The case was adjourned until December.</p>
<p>Turkey's restrictions on written dissent, mostly used against Kurdish activists, have often been criticised in the West.</p>
