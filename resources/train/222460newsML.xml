<p>An explosion in the courtyard of the home of Jan Smerek, President of the VSZ steel mill in Kosice, eastern Slovakia on Thursday, shattered windows, but caused no injuries, the private radio Twist reported.</p>
<p>The radio station said the explosive device had been thrown over a fence shortly after midnight and made a 10 cm (four inch) deep crater in the concrete yard of Smerek's private house.</p>
<p>Smerek told the radio he saw no reason for the attack. &quot;I have so far received no threats, or even indications and I have no idea what this is supposed to mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Only two months ago, VSZ, the country's largest steel producer, received bomb threats but no further problems were reported.</p>
<p>Officials at both VSZ and the Kosice police were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>The blast was the latest in a spate of bomb attacks and threats in Slovakia this year.</p>
<p>Last April, a former policeman with connections to the case of the abduction of Michal Kovac Jr, the son of Slovak President Kovac, was killed when an explosive device blew up his car.</p>
<p>In May, a grenade was thrown at the car of Bela Bugar, leader of one of Slovakia's Hungarian minority parties, causing only slight damage and no injuries.</p>
<p>In August a car bomb exploded outside a house in Bratislava in which several Ukrainians live. Two days later an off-duty policeman was killed while allegedly laying a bomb behind a foreign exchange booth in central Bratislava at night.</p>
<p>Bratislava's law faculty has been closed and evacuated several times this year following bomb threats and earlier this week one of the capital's largest hospitals was also partly evacuated following a bomb threat.</p>
