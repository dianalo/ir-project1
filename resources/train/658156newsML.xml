<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end mixed.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates, spots end mixed.</headline>

<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed on Thursday.</p>
<p>Three early-maturing contracts ended down with the market losing support from the domestic A share markets, which had performed poorly in the past few days, traders said.</p>
<p>But three late-maturing contracts rose due to an expected reduction of fund supply on the market in the mid-term after Beijing banned state banks trading on the market last week.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract fell to 8.00 percent from 10.06 percent on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market rose to 3.2 million lots from 1.4 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders said the sluggish A share markets made short-term money demand decrease, depressing the early-maturing contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;But the interest rates for late-maturing contracts rose with investors expected money supply in the mid-term to drop because of the ban on state banks,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the repo rates to go down slightly on Friday.  </p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mixed in sluggish trading on Thursday on a lack of market-moving news, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 fell to 121.90 yuan from 122.62 yuan.</p>
<p>The bond will be suspended from trading on Friday for the payment of the first year's interest.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market rose to 1.6 million lots from 1.2 million lots.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the contracts to move narrowly on Friday due to the suspension of the 10-year bond, the market leader.</p>
