<p>News and information group Reuters Holdings Plc said on Thursday its dealing room systems at several Hong Kong financial institutions were affected last week after a Reuter engineer tampered with their operating systems.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no evidence to suggest these clients have suffered any adverse commercial impact nor that any of their data has been affected as a result,&quot; said the company in a statement.</p>
<p>Reuters Asia Managing Director, Geoffrey Weetman, said &quot;We are satisfied there is nothing in this incident which impacts on the basic security of any Reuters platform, systems, networks, or products.&quot;  </p>
<p>Initial reports of problems at the sites reached Reuters during the evening of November 18 and early morning on November 19 and these client systems were restored to full operation early morning November 20, the statement said.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been kept fully informed. &quot;Internal investigations conducted as the incidents came to light identified a single Reuters engineer as having been responsible for the problems,&quot; said the company.</p>
<p>The company said it had reviewed and tightened procedures and had suspended the engineer concerned. His name has been given to the police.</p>
<p>Reuters &quot;deeply regrets the abuse of trust&quot; involved in the matter, said Weetman.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to suggest collusion with any other party, or any motives other than a personal problem with this employee acting alone,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company declined to name the institutions involved in the incident.</p>
