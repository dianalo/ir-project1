<p>With a second indictment against former Sumitomo trader Yasuo Hamanaka, Japanese prosecutors have signalled that they have wrapped up their investigations and believe that the onetime copper guru acted alone.</p>
<p>Sources close to prosecutors said on Tuesday they are ready to move to trial in the Hamanaka case, the biggest financial scandal in market history, and have no plans to pursue any other possible suspects.</p>
<p>Tokyo prosecutors on Monday indicted Hamanaka on a charge of fraud for allegedly creating fictitious accounts used for years for copper trading unknown to his superiors at Sumitomo.</p>
<p>The trading house says he racked up losses of $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>Hamanaka was already in custody on forgery charges after being arrested on October 22. Tokyo prosecutors indicted him on four counts of forgery last month.</p>
<p>&quot;The Tokyo prosecutors are now determined to close the case following the two indictments against Hamanaka,&quot; one source close to the prosecutors said. &quot;And the prosecutors have no plans to pursue anybody else, except Hamanaka, regarding this case at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a move would exonerate Sumitomo Corp and its senior executives of a role in the affair -- at least as far as Japanese prosecutors are concerned.</p>
<p>A statement by prosecutors last month said Hamanaka was suspected of fraudulently obtaining about $771 million from a Sumitomo Hong Kong subsidiary to cover massive losses from off-the-book copper option deals.</p>
<p>Hamanaka was the world's most controversial and influential copper trader until Sumitomo sacked him in June.</p>
<p>Traders said that for years he artificially propped up the price of copper, which is used in a wide variety of products ranging from automobiles to air conditioners.</p>
<p>Sumitomo has repeatedly insisted that none of Hamanaka's superiors knew of his illicit deals, which are also the subject of investigations by U.S. and British regulators.</p>
<p>&quot;Our internal investigation is going on. We're establishing all the facts about what happened,&quot; a Sumitomo spokesman said.</p>
<p>One of Hamanaka's lawyers said the team would begin forming their defence but would not elaborate.</p>
<p>&quot;We're now going to start working on a specific and detailed strategy for the trial following the indictments,&quot; said Toru Yoshiki, one of Hamanaka's three lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;It usually takes two months to hold the first trial after the indictment. But this case attracted world-wide attention because of its huge losses, and I can't estimate the exact time frame at this stage,&quot; the lawyer said.</p>
<p>The source close to prosecutors said the first trial would be held no later than next March.</p>
<p>Yoshiki said Hamanaka, who is being held at the Tokyo Detention Centre, seems to have lost some weight but was fine.</p>
<p>The former trader, 48, could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted on the fraud charges, and could serve a maximum five-year sentence for forgery, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>While Hamanaka has admitted committing forgery, he denied manipulating the world copper market or that he acted for personal gain. He has not commented publicly on the later fraud charge.</p>
<p>One senior Sumitomo official has said there were no signs of market manipulation by Hamanaka even though international traders have accused him of controlling the world copper price through his massive positions in the market.</p>
