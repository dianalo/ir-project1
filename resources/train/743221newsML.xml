<p>If there were any lingering doubts about Portugal's chances of making Europe's single currency, France's budgetary battles should have buried them, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>With a budgetary deficit that looks like satisfying the most stringent interpretation of entry tests for economic and monetary union (EMU), Portugal, once the rank outsider, is better placed than France to make the grade.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the one argument that could be used against Lisbon, namely that it is a relative newcomer to the ranks of the financially disciplined, loses force if EMU rules are stretched to accommodate France.</p>
<p>A French state audit showed on Monday that the country's budget deficit was heading for 3.5-3.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, well above the 3.0 percent that has often been cited as the ceiling for aspiring members.</p>
<p>The government of Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced a series of measures to reduce the gap. But they will not close it by more than 0.4 percentage points, leaving France needing its European partners to show flexibility in the application of the EMU criteria, analysts said.</p>
<p>Along with Germany, France is seen as a central pillar of a future monetary union and without it, the project could not realistically go ahead, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose it (France's problem) lends even greater credibility to Portugal. It highlights just how successful they have been,&quot; said economist Debbie Bennellick of UBS in London.</p>
<p>Bennellick added that over the past few months, as it became clear that the European Union was leaving itself some room for manoeuvre on EMU entry, she had become increasingly convinced that Portugal would be in the first wave of countries to launch monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>Prices on the bond market, normally a sensitive barometer of mood, fell in Portugal on Monday. But this was more a reflection of fresh international doubts about whether EMU would be launched on time rather than any domestic concern, traders said.</p>
<p>The yield spread with the German government Bund, the European market's benchmark, remained rock steady at a premium of 0.70 of a percentage point premium. Analysts said a spread of 70 basis points indicated that the market put Portugal's chances of joining EMU at the outset at between 75 and 80 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;That seems fair value to me,&quot; said Jose Luis Alzola of Salomon Brothers in London.</p>
<p>Alzola, who has been long confident that both Spain and Portugal would make the cut for EMU, said that he did not feel the French announcement had changed the outlook for Lisbon in any fundamental way.</p>
<p>&quot;It's chances of being in EMU are very high,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The only doubts that the economist expressed over the performance of Portugal, where the budget deficit is officially forecast at 2.9 percent of GDP this year, were whether inflation was as firmly under control as the figures suggested.</p>
<p>The year-on-year rate in both Spain and Portugal has fallen below two percent but Alzola said that the huge improvement had probably been helped along by some special factors.</p>
<p>Both had been aided by favourable trends in food and oil prices, for example.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that either country is going to return to the ranks of the high inflation countries. But on the other hand, I think the (inflation) numbers understate the real position,&quot; he said.</p>
