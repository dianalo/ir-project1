<p>Domingo Cavallo, architect of Argentina's free market reforms and economic &quot;superminister&quot; until he was fired, will try to return to politics by running for Congress next year.</p>
<p>An aide to the former minister, who steered the country's biggest economic transformation in decades, said on Friday Cavallo would bid for a seat in the lower house.</p>
<p>But the Harvard-trained economist, a technocrat who never joined the ruling Peronist party, will not represent the movement whose members increasingly opposed his austerity strategy and confrontational style.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be in a new party or some other independent movement,&quot; the aide told Reuters, &quot;and not with one of the main opposition parties either.&quot;</p>
<p>Peronist President Carlos Menem replaced Cavallo, 50, in July after they clashed over belt-tightening measures that drew widespread opposition. Praised abroad for shrinking inflation to zero from 5,000 percent five years ago, the austerity at a time of recession and 17 percent unemployment fuelled anger from labour, church and political opponents.</p>
<p>In what was their first discussion since he was fired, Cavallo met with Menem for 40 minutes in the presidential residence Olivos on Wednesday to inform him of his decision. The president, who had anticipated Cavallo's return to politics, reacted &quot;very positively,&quot; the aide said.</p>
<p>Argentines will vote for half of their legislators in the lower house of Congress in elections due in late 1997. Cavallo sees Congress as a platform from which to continue promoting reform and oppose what he calls &quot;mafias&quot; seeking a monopoly on public services such as the post office for criminal ends.</p>
<p>Since he left government, he has been an adviser to new Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram and has been on the lecture circuit, commanding fees of up to $25,000 per speech.</p>
<p>Cavallo was also foreign minister until 1991, when he was moved to the Economy portfolio and launched the Convertibility Plan, which pegged the peso to the dollar to slash inflation.</p>
<p>Ex-President Raul Alfonsin of the opposition Radical Party welcomed his decision but warned it would be a challenge for someone with a reputation of paying little heed to critics.</p>
<p>&quot;He was used to one type of activity that wasn't exactly politics because he dismissed anyone who was against him,&quot; Alfonsin told local television. &quot;Politics is dialogue and debate ... It has nothing to do with authoritarian positions.&quot;</p>
