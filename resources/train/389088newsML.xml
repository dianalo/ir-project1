<p>Switzerland's 1996 federal deficit was 315 million Swiss francs over budget at 4.36 billion francs due to lower than expected tax and customs income, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The federal debt grew by five billion to 87 billion Swiss francs,&quot; a ministry statement said, adding that interest payments were eight million Swiss francs a day.</p>
<p>It said the budget remained overloaded with structural committments to spending.</p>
<p>Revenues were 1.1 percent or 447 million Swiss francs under budget, which was only partially offset by using left-over funds from earlier years to lower 1996 spending by 132 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Reforming federal finances remains a pressing task of the coming years,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Switzerland's parliament in December approved a federal budget for 1997 with a deficit of 5.77 billion Swiss francs, as against a 3.26 billion shortfall in 1995.</p>
<p>The biggest factor in 1996 budget growth was higher social security costs, which rose 24.7 percent from 1995 to total 12.7 billion francs out of total expenditures of 43.8 billion.</p>
<p>Social security spending was driven by higher unemployment payments, pension contributions and health insurance contributions due to a stagnent economy, higher joblessness, an aging population and health reform.</p>
<p>Agricultural spending also rose, growing 11.5 percent to 3.9 billion as the mad cow disease scare undermined efforts to cut subsidies by prompting support payments for cattle and beef producers.</p>
<p>On the other side, revenues failed to meet expectations as a sixth year of economic stagnation dampened sales, slowed imports and lower income taxes.</p>
<p>Revenues totalled 39.5 billion Swiss francs last year after 37.3 billion the year before.</p>
<p>The Swiss federal budget has less of a market impact than those in other industrialised countries because of the relatively large volume of spending by the 26 cantons (states) and half-cantons and hundreds of community authorities. -- Zurich Newsroom, +41-1-631 7340</p>
