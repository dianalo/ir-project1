<p>An expected record number of new issues on the Tokyo stock market this year may trigger worries whether the market can absorb the new shares if trading remains sluggish as it is now, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market was supported by an uptrend and trading volume was heavy, there would be no problem,&quot; said Tetsuya Ishijima, chief strategist at Okasan Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the current situation, underlying fears of oversupply are gradually surfacing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Japanese equities market has hit the doldrums, with turnover in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) mostly below 300 million shares in August.</p>
<p>On Monday, turnover in the first section was an estimated 211 million shares, the lowest for the year.</p>
<p>Unless it grows to about 400 to 500 million shares, the market might come under pressure when big issues go public, analysts say.</p>
<p>The sluggishness has been filtering into the second section of the TSE and over-the-counter (OTC) market.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors are hesitant to buy stocks actively, partly because they are not confident the Japanese economy can achieve sustainable recovery later this year.</p>
<p>As of August 26, a total 29 firms had announced plans to list on the bourse in 1996, compared with 32 firms in 1995, the TSE said.</p>
<p>The rush into equity-financing comes from firms that have waited until the country's economy pulled out of the recession.</p>
<p>In the over-the-counter (OTC) market, where smaller capitalised stocks not listed on the TSE are traded, shares of 130 firms are likely to start trading in 1996, close to the previous year's 137 firms, Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities &amp; Economics Inc estimated.</p>
<p>Individual investors, who play a major role in the OTC market, are inactive because they were hit hard in the recent plunge in incentive-backed speculative shares.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market was already vulnerable due to the scheduled listing of West Japan Railway Co (JR West) and planned new stock issuance by Japan's major banks, which are already listed on the TSE.</p>
<p>&quot;What is worrying me is not listings of newly established companies but new shares by well-known companies, such as banks and JR West,&quot; said Tamio Kimura, chief strategist at Yamaichi Research Institute.</p>
<p>The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd (IBJ) said in July that it would issue 188.12 million new shares to increase its capital adequacy ratio.</p>
<p>Other banks are expected to follow suit. Sakura Bank Ltd said on Friday it had decided to issue 75 million shares of preferred stock later this year.</p>
<p>JR West, part of the former debt-laden Japanese National Railways being privatised, will sell 1.7 million shares and list on October 8.</p>
<p>&quot;Until October, the pressure of new stock supply will remain in the market,&quot; Kimura said.</p>
<p>He said, however, compared with the issues of the banks and JR West, those of new companies would have less impact on the market, as these companies are fast growing companies and will whet investors' appetite.</p>
<p>Takefuji Corp, Japan's biggest consumer financing firm, will be registered foor OTC trading on August 30. Takefuji will offer five million shares to the public.</p>
<p>Another possible big issue by Oriental Land Co Ltd, which operates Tokyo Disneyland, is expected to be listed on the second section of the TSE later this year.</p>
