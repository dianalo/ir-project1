<title>USA: NY physical coffee - spot business at a standstill.</title>
<headline>NY physical coffee - spot business at a standstill.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>The New York physical coffee market remained sluggish this week with few spot sales as roasters seemed content to sit on the sidelines and wait for the CSCE May contract to go off the boards, traders said.</p>
<p>With roasters' needs in the short-term well met, traders said processors were stalling to see if futures prices would ease once the spot contract expires on May 19.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems the roaster have enough coffee nearby and roasting has slowed down,&quot; one trader said. &quot;They are just waiting to see what happens when May goes off the boards.&quot;  </p>
<p>Although most prompt business is now being priced against the cheaper second-month July contract, traders said sky-high spot differentials -- save Brazilians -- kept prices at unattractive levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is going on,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Nobody needs any coffee, nobody wants any and prices are through the roof.&quot;</p>
<p>Colombian coffees remained extremely hard-to-come-by -- and pricey. Spot MAMs were heard at 48-50 cents over July.</p>
<p>A one-day strike by workers at Brazil's key coffee-loading port of Santos had little impact on differentials from the world's top grower.  </p>
<p>Brazilian producers were selling aggressively this week and their beans were viewed as bargains compared to other coffees. Spot Santos 4s fetched 18 cents under July.</p>
<p>&quot;The Brazilians want to sell coffee left over from the last crop with the new crop coming and they want to sell at these prices,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I think you're going to see people using more Brazils.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, traders were beginning to hear offers for arabica coffees from Rwanda and Burundi, where war has devasted production. Spot Ocirus were offered in Europe at 12 over July, they said.</p>
<p>CSCE May coffee fell 1.00 cent a lb Friday to settle at 239.00. July ended 1.00 cent higher at 217.90.</p>
<p>Differentials for spot coffee in New York, ex-warehouse, were quoted as follows, all against the CSCE May contract:</p>
<p>  USc/Lb			Differentials (basis July)     Last</p>
<p>  Santos 4's		  18 cts under &quot;C&quot;	     199.90 N</p>
