<p>The top Justice Department lawyer handling anti-trust said Thursday that transformation of the world economy is altering anti-trust enforcement.</p>
<p>&quot;The nature of the way we compete and the globalization of the world economy are the two vectors that have come together to really breathe some new life into anti-trust enforcement,&quot; said Joel Klein, acting head of the Justice Department's anti-trust division.</p>
<p>He told the anti-trust division of the District of Columbia Bar Association that the new telecommunications law -- which opened up competition in the rapidly evolving areas of cable, computers, television and telephones -- has forced a rethinking of the nature of anti-trust.</p>
<p>For example, the anti-trust division and other regulators are wrestling with the question of what rules should govern the coming competition between telephone companies that have traditionally competed in either local or long distance service but not both.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also faces new challenges in the international arena.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people -- the Europeans in particular -- are looking for some form of international code and prevention in the not too distance future,&quot; he said. &quot;We are quite cautious about moving forward too quickly toward internationalization.&quot;</p>
<p>Klein said the United States prefers &quot;what we consider to be the more effective bilateral method of enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there is increasing co-operation with the European Union. Klein said a mechanism is being set up where the United States could make a referral which the EU would investigate and analyze. It would then report back to the United States.</p>
<p>Klein attended the recent World Trade Organization meeting of meeting of ministers in Singapore, which established a panel to look at international anti-trust issues.</p>
