<p>Solid Group Inc rose by 30 centavos, or five percent, to 6.30 pesos in late Friday trade on better-than-expected 1996 earnings, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Its net income was beyond expectation and the issue is a primary consumer play. While it was generally set aside last year, the issue is also being boosted by expectations of enhanced margins this year,&quot; said Jonas Ferrer, research director at Pryce Securities.  </p>
<p>The company had reported a net income of 839 million pesos for 1996 and although no comparative figures were given by the company, brokers said the amount was higher than expected.</p>
<p>Pryce's Ferrer said they were expecting 820 million pesos in profits.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue has been a laggard and with its 1996 earnings coming out and showing strong foreign orders, the market is buying up the issue,&quot; said Fitz Aclan, research head at Dharmala Securities Phils Inc.</p>
<p>Solid was among the top ten most actively traded stocks on Friday with 87.45 million shares changing hands.</p>
