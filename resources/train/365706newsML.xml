<title>AUSTRALIA: Larger Australian T-bond tender expected.</title>
<headline>Larger Australian T-bond tender expected.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian Treasury is expected to hold a fixed-rate bond tender this week and traders believe it could be larger than recent offerings to accomodate this year's revised borrowing requirement.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting an A$800 million to A$1.0 billion offering. I think tenders will have to be a bit larger to take into account the extra A$2.0 billion forecast by the Treasury,&quot; said one trader at a European based bank.</p>
<p>The Treasury raised its forecast for fixed rate bond issuance last month to A$8.0 to A$9.0 billion for the 1996/97 year ending June 30, up A$2.0 billion from budget time.  </p>
<p>This increase in funding could also see the tender incorporate three tranches, rather than the two that has been seen in recent tenders, traders said.</p>
<p>The last tender was held on January 14 when two tranches of stock totalling A$600 million where offered.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting a tender of at least A$800 million and definately something in the November 2006,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Other stocks being touted as likely candidates to be tapped are the January 2001, the October 2007 or the August 2008 stocks.  </p>
<p>At the mid-year review of the budget in January, the Treasury said fixed coupon issuance had raised A$4.8 billion in the fiscal year so far, implying A$3.0 to A$4.0 billion supply over the rest of 1996/97.</p>
<p>Tender details would be announced today 12.00 p.m. (0100 GMT). Final bids would be due in at 12.45 p.m. (0145 GMT) on Tuesday and the result would be released shortly afterwards at 2.00 (0300 GMT).</p>
