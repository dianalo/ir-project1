<p>Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said on Monday his country viewed as frivolous and &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot; Russian threats of economic reprisals for Prague's entry into NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the North Atlantic alliance with bilateral (Czech-Russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context,&quot; the Czech news agency CTK quoted Zieleniec as saying.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Moscow's ambassador to Prague Nikolai Ryabov warned the Czech Republic that key bilateral agreements with Russia might be jeopardised if it joined NATO.</p>
<p>Ryabov told Russia's NTV commercial television that the former Warsaw Pact member's entry into the western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a real blow for the Russian economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ambassador went on to hint that Moscow could reconsider economic deals with Prague if it went ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Agreements fundamental to the Czech Republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face (if Prague joined NATO),&quot; said Ryabov, former head of Russia's central electoral commission.</p>
<p>Zieleniec told CTK that Ryabov's statement made it clear why the Czechs wanted to join western organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;This type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important, at the earliest, to become a member of the key western political, economic, and security organisations,&quot; it quoted Zieleniec as saying.</p>
<p>He said he thought the ambassador's interview on Russian television was mostly for media consumption.</p>
<p>The Czechs, Poland and Hungary are expected to be named among the first former-Soviet Bloc countries to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid.</p>
<p>Russian officials have intensified their rhetoric against NATO expansion plans, which they say threaten Russia's security, in the run-up to a summit in Helsinki this week between President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Moscow hopes to use the issue as a lever with which to win concessions from the U.S.-led alliance on arms control agreements and other security and economic issues.</p>
<p>After the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total Czech trade turnover with Russia grew 9.8 percent in 1996 to $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>But 1996 trade was heavily weighted in Russia's favour with Czech exports to Russia at $694 million and while imports from Russia were $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>Czechs are still dependent on Russia for natural gas and most of its crude oil, but Prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long-term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from Norway.</p>
<p>Last year, the Czechs opened the Ingolstadt spur in the Transalpine crude pipeline from the Adriatic Sea, providing direct access to crude from the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Czech power company CEZ a.s. is also dependent on Russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at Dukovany, but the company is expected to take U.S.-supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at Temelin by the end of the century.</p>
<p>The Czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly Soviet-era equipment with Western-made, NATO compatible goods.</p>
