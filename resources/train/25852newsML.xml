<title>CANADA: Canadian bonds weaker at early close on U.S. data.</title>
<headline>Canadian bonds weaker at early close on U.S. data.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1996-08-30</dateline>

<p>Canadian bonds were weaker as the market closed early on Friday, selling off with U.S. treasuries following the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. data, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. market is in tough shape,&quot; said John Johnston, deputy chief economist with Royal Bank of Canada. &quot;We've seen the Canadian dollar show some weakness, and the Canadian market is underperforming the U.S. as a result.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 fell C$0.85 to C$100.75 to yield 7.930 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 30/32 to yield 7.12 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between benchmark bonds was 81 basis points, unchanged from the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and U.S. markets tumbled after the release of strong U.S. economic data on Friday, including a report showing the Chicago Purchasing Managers August index rose to 60 from 51.2 in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The purchasing managers number is extremely, extremely strong,&quot; said Jim Webber, director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Canadian economic data release today had initially protected Canada from the selloff, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Statistics Canada on Friday reported Canada's current account moved to a higher-than-expected C$1.15 billion second quarter surplus from a C$1.62 billion deficit in the first quarter. It was the first surplus since 1984.</p>
<p>The agency also reported Canada's real gross domestic product rose a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent in the second quarter or 1.3 percent at an annualized rate.</p>
<p>While the data helped Canada outperform early in the session, the weak GDP data prompted speculation the Bank of Canada may cut rates again. This weakened the currency and helped send bond prices lower.  </p>
<p>Early in the session, the Toronto Bond Traders' Association recommended dealings end early at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT on Friday ahead of the Labour Day Holiday.</p>
<p>In other prices, the 7.0 percent of 2006 fell C$0.46 to C$96.69 to yield 7.466 percent. The U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 21/32 to yield 6.95 percent.</p>
<p>The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 52 basis points from 54 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash bill traded at 4.05 percent against the U.S. three-month bill at 5.29 percent.</p>
