<p>Brazil's state oil firm Petrobras expects its average daily oil output to rise by 16 percent to at least 830,000 barrels versus 716,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1995, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase this year is due to the start of production at new wells,&quot; the spokesman said, adding the figure could be surpassed next year with the start-up of the Campo de Marlim oil field.</p>
<p>Output reached an average 794,000 bpd in the first nine months versus 703,000 in January-September 1995, when output was affected by an oilworkers strike.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Petrobras President Joel Mendes Renno said Petrobras's November production is expected to reach 900,000 bpd and 25 million cubic meters of natural gas.</p>
<p>He did not give a comparable figure for the same month last year, but said it was 20 percent higher than output in January 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;These numbers will continue growing progressively over the next two years until we are producing 70 percent of our national consumption,&quot; he said during a speech at the signing ceremony for a new Sao Paulo area petrochemical complex.  </p>
<p>Petrobras, which is expected to be privatized in coming years, now produces enough to supply about 50 percent of internal demand, he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company signed a $4.3 billion joint-venture investment agreement with four private companies to build a petrochemical complex in Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>Petrobras has teamed up with OPP Petroquimica of the Oderbrecht group, Elekeiroz of the Itausa group and two other firms to build the complex at Paulinia.</p>
<p>The complex will create 20,000 new jobs by 2005 and $200 million a year in tax revenue in the first three or four years and $500 million a year in revenues after 2000, officials said.</p>
