<p>Precious metals prices have risen to their highest levels for several weeks this week, but weakness in grains and some tropical products is keeping the pressure on the Knight Ridder Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB), analysts said.</p>
<p>However, the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI), which has a much higher weighting in the energy sector is consolidating near five month highs.  </p>
<p>&quot;Commodities in general have been weak recently and its only the energy sector that has been performing well,&quot; Smith Barney commodities strategist Bill O'Neill said.</p>
<p>The CRB was off 0.45 points at 244.51 midday Wednesday, after dipping to a four week low at 243.11 last Friday.</p>
<p>New York Futures Exchange (NYFE) November CRB futures were up 0.05 points at 243.00 midday, but look still to be within their downtrend since early September, analysts said.</p>
<p>The GSCI was down 2.52 points at 210.71 midday, after seeing a five month high at 214.78 on October 9, lead by the energy complex which has a 49 percent weighting in the index.  </p>
<p>CME November GSCI futures were down 1.70 points at 211.00 midday, though the momentum of the contract's rally since August looks to be waning, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Precious metals may be bottoming as we head into what is seasonally a good demand period for precious and base metals, but so far the recovery looks to have been driven by funds shortcovering as open interest has fallen,&quot; O'Neill said.</p>
<p>Precious metals make up 18 pct of the CRB Index but only three pct of the GSCI.  </p>
<p>COMEX December gold was down 40 cents at $385.70 midday, but saw a four week high at $386.40 Tuesday, while December silver was unchanged at $4.990 midday, after recovering to the $5.000 level intraday.</p>
<p>&quot;Fund shortcovering is starting but so far its only about 10-15 percent of the total position,&quot; Friedberg Mercantile Group's Toronto based analyst Chris Foster said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're believers in longer dated call options while volatilties remain low, but short term we're doing very little,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Open interest in gold futures fell 6,210 lots Monday to 187,813, while silver open interest was down 947 lots at 94,098 lots.</p>
<p>Funds had built up a record net short position in recent months, according to the CFTC Commitment of Traders data.</p>
<p>&quot;But the weekly momentums on December gold and silver and January platinum have all turned positive,&quot; Dorsey Wright and Associates president Thomas Dorsey of Virginia said.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Stock Exchanges's sector index of the 11 major U.S. gold and silver stocks also looks to be bottoming out, after a decline since May this year, analysts noted.  </p>
<p>but is off the nine month lows seen at 113.56 on September 30.</p>
<p>COMEX warehouse gold stocks have declined to 1,054,294 ounces last week, their lowest level since November 1977, while COMEX silver stocks saw 10 year lows at 130,744,022 ounces.</p>
<p>U.S. silver exports in the first seven months of 1996 rose to around 61.09 million ounces (1,900 tonnes), about twice the levels seen last year, analysts noted.</p>
<p>Most of the silver is believed to have been shipped to Asia via the U.K. and Dubai, with India a favorite destination, analysts said.</p>
<p>India is also the world's largest consumer of gold and with demand seen getting a seasonal boost from the Hindu festivals of Dassera this week and Diwali in November.</p>
<p>However, the strong U.S. dollar, which hit a 33 month high against the yen at 113 yen Wednesday, is restraining demand in Japan.</p>
<p>For the first eight months of 1996 Japanese gold imports totalled only 105 tonnes, 47 pct lower than year-ago level. --New York Commodities +1-212-859-1641 --email:clive.mckeef@reuters.com</p>
