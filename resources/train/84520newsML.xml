<p>White House chief of staff Leon Panetta said President Clinton was happy with the spending bill, which was agreed to in bipartisan negotiations over the weekend before it passed the House, as it reflected his priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;The president was very pleased with the outcome of these negotiations,&quot; Panetta said. &quot;The budget reflects the priorities that the president has established for this country.&quot; Those priorities were continuing to move toward a balanced budget, while protecting programs such as education, the environment, and funding for a program to put 100,000 more police on the streets, Panetta said.  </p>
<p>Panetta said the spending bill was a victory for Clinton, because it restored money for some programs that the Republican-majority Congress had sought to cut. But he also commended the bipartisanship that forged the agreemeent just before the October 1 beginning of the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>Panetta said neither Republicans nor Democrats had wanted another government shutdown, as happened last year when an accord could not be reached.</p>
<p>Panetta said the fiscal 1997 accord restored about $6.5 billion to $7 billion &quot;in the areas that we cared about&quot; by paying for it elsewhere in the budget.  </p>
<p>Franklin Raines, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the administration was ahead of schedule in its efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit, and that it could continue to stay ahead of schedule if revenues continue to come in ahead of expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;If we continue to see good numbers coming out of Treasury on revenue, we will make more progress than the president promised&quot; on the deficit, Raines said, speaking at the White House briefing with Panetta.</p>
