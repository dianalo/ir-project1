<p>Hong Kong launched cyanide checks on food imports from China on Thursday after a huge cyanide spillage into a south China river caused alarm throughout the Pearl River delta region.</p>
<p>The action was taken in Hong Kong after reports that a truck carrying 200 drums of toxic potassium cyanide had plunged into a tributary of the Pearl River.</p>
<p>&quot;As a precaution, we will take samples of produce from the mainland, especially vegatables and seafood, to check whether they are poisoned with cyanide,&quot; a Health Department spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, she said the risk was very slight, as most of the produce coming from China was from the area of Shenzhen, just across the border from the British colony and on the eastern side of the Pearl River delta.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, with scarce land resources, has to rely on imported food, mostly from China.</p>
<p>Health checks on food imports are routinely carried out, for example to guard against pesticide poisoning, but the cyanide checks are new.</p>
<p>Authorities in southern China and Portuguese-administered Macau have issued warnings of cyanide poisoning in waters there.</p>
<p>Officials from Wuzhou in Guangxi province, further to the west, said three of the 200 drums were missing and 700 kg (1,545 pounds) of the toxic chemical, which was to have been used for electroplating, may have entered the West River river.</p>
<p>The river is a tributary of the Pearl River, which flows through heavily populated Guangdong province and into the South China Sea near Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman from Hong Kong's water department said the territory's water supply was not in danger as the water imported from China was from another tributary of the Pearl River system.</p>
<p>No deaths or sicknesses related to the spill have so far been reported in China, Macau or Hong Kong.</p>
