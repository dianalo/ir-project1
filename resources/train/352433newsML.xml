<p>The European Commission, determined to remove remaining obstacles to a single market in financial services, decided on Monday to take legal action against Germany over investment trust restrictions.</p>
<p>The European Union executive said it would take Germany to the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice under EU treaty infringement procedures because of restrictions imposed on investment trusts established in other member states.</p>
<p>&quot;The European Commission considers the restrictions violate...treaty rules on the freedom to provide services and the free movement of capital,&quot; the Commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>Germany bans marketing to the public of units in investment trusts of the so-called closed-end type, which have no obligation to buy back units from the investor.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though it applies to both domestic and foreign undertakings, the European Commission considers that it obstructs the activity of suppliers which are established in other member states and which lawfully provide their services there,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>In addition, it said holders in Germany of units in such investment funds did not enjoy the same tax advantages as holders of other investment fund units.</p>
<p>The restrictions could not be justified on the grounds of &quot;overriding public interest and are disproportionate,&quot; the Commission said.</p>
<p>German authorities had failed to reply to a so-called reasoned opinion -- the second stage in such legal proceedings -- sent in August in last year.</p>
<p>EU Internal Market Commissioner Mario Monti said remaining obstacles to a single market in financial services had an adverse effect on the development of competition in the sector in the 15-nation EU.</p>
<p>&quot;I will vigorously pursue infringement cases against all member states attempting to impose unjustified barriers to a single market in financial services,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Financial services are part of the EU's single market, launched on January 1, 1993, which broke down barriers to trade in goods, services and capitals between member states.</p>
<p>Progress had earlier been slow with some member states justifying their national rules on consumer protection grounds.</p>
<p>In a report last October on the impact and effectiveness of the single market, the Commission said further measures may be needed to free up financial services, which include banking, mortgage lending and insurance.</p>
<p>It said there were still some loopholes used to hamper cross-border provision of services or establishment.</p>
