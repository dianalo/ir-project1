<p>Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga plans to address a series of rallies across the country to explain her devolution proposals aimed at ending a 14-year-old ethnic war, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We still feel that the level of awareness among the people is inadequate. The thrust of our campaign will be to give them a clearer notion of the constitution reforms,&quot; said Gamini Peiris, Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.</p>
<p>The move was also seen as an attempt by Kumaratunga to drum up public support for her proposals and push the main opposition United National Party (UNP) into accepting them.</p>
<p>The proposals include constitutional reforms to devolve powers to new administrative units in a bid to partly meet the demand of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels for a separate homeland in the India Ocean island's north and east.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a significant impact on the people, the UNP will have to take a definite stand, one way or the other,&quot; Peiris, the architect of the reforms, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The constitutional reform proposals are currently bogged in a parliamentary select committee where Kumaratunga's ruling People's Alliance is battling opposition parties, including the UNP, for a consensus.</p>
<p>UNP support is crucial as the government needs a two-thirds majority in parliament, where it has a slim majority, to pass the new constitution.</p>
<p>But UNP officials said the party would wait for a final package before giving its support, if at all.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has not made up its mind on several issues. Let them tell us what they finally want and we will then look at the issues,&quot; a UNP lawmaker said.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga's meetings seem to be leading towards a non-binding referendum on the proposals, which if won by the government can put UNP in a spot and force its support.</p>
<p>Last month, Kumaratunga told a two-day meeting of her lawmakers that she could be forced to hold a nationwide non-binding referendum on the proposals ahead of taking them to parliament if the opposition's support was not forthcoming.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not decided on a referendum, it is an alternative that is within the framework of the existing constitution,&quot; Peiris said.</p>
<p>Political analysts said a non-binding referendum prior to putting the proposals before parliament would have no significant legal stature, but the opposition would have to take a moral decision whether to oppose it if a majority of the nation votes in favour.</p>
<p>Once approved by parliament, the draft constitution will have to again face a national referendum for it to become legal.</p>
<p>While pursuing a political solution to the conflict, the government also seems firm in its resolve to continue the battle to neutralise the LTTE militarily and push them in a corner.</p>
<p>A military offensive in the north, launched in May to open a strategic northern highway and deal a blow to the LTTE's fighting machinery, has slowed after three major counter-attacks by the rebels.</p>
<p>The government says the death toll in the war against the LTTE is more than 50,000. The LTTE say the figure is higher.</p>
