<title>SLOVAKIA: Tatra Banka rates Nafta shares as long-term buy.</title>
<headline>Tatra Banka rates Nafta shares as long-term buy.</headline>

<p>Shares of oil and gas storage company Nafta Gbely are undervalued compared to its competitors in East Europe and are a good long-term buy, Tatra Banka said in an investor report.</p>
<p>The bank forecast Nafta's after-tax profit to fall to around 450 million crowns in 1996, some 25 percent less than the previous year, due to lower gas prices and storage fees.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not expect radical changes in the (profit) development this year, but we still consider the share good for long-term investment,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>The report said Nafta's 800 million crown investment programme to increase storage capacity and diversification of gas supplies should increase profit margins in coming years.</p>
<p>&quot;Nafta shares are undervalued in terms of their price to earnings ratio, forecast at 10.8 in 1997, compared with similar companies in the region,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Nafta's price has been hovering around 1,600 crowns over the past few months, closing at 1,650 on the Bratislava Stock Exchange on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nafta shares fell by over 20 percent in the second half of last year after the government sold its entire stake of 45.9 percent to little-known company Druha Obchodna for 500 million crowns, while the value of the stake at the BSE was some 3.2 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Analysts have said Nafta's new owners have so far said little about their long-term strategy, which has put off foreign investors, but the report said it expected little change.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the new owners will continue with Nafta's long-term commercial strategy so the current price then is a good opportunity to accumulate profits.&quot;</p>
