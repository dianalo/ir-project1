<headline>LME tumbles by close, unnerves others.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-30</dateline>

<p>A swift downturn in  zinc after a relatively calm morning helped take other base metals from their highs by the close of Wednesday's London Metal Exchange (LME) business.</p>
<p>Recent star zinc dropped to a low of $1,440 a tonne as large sell-orders between the afternoon rings emerged.</p>
<p>One trader said that an offer around the market near $1,490 was well received by floor trading members but this confidence was quickly sidelined as even lower offers were seen in second ring LME trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It came at of the blue, noone had expected the market to be offered so low in such a short period of time,&quot; one zinc trader said.</p>
<p>This was enough to send the other base metals lower.</p>
<p>&quot;Where the sell orders came from is unsure and is likely to remain unexplained until the dust settles,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>Several others suggested it was liquidation by investment funds and nervous longs who believed that Chinese smelters that had been running short positions were now square.</p>
<p>But with nearby dates still remaining tight others said that the Chinese smelters could not be square. &quot;The backwardation remains strong...if the Chinese are now level then we should see a contango,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Final three months business was at $1,460, down on Tuesday's $1,480 close and an earlier high of $1,530. On Monday prices peaked at a seven-year high of $1,675.</p>
<p>The cash to three months spread was indicated at around $95, against $70 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Copper at one stage dived to a low of $2,285 after zinc's decline. But by the close of business once the &quot;panic selling&quot; had subsided three months delivery bounced back to $2,305, down from $2,359.</p>
<p>Traders said LME stock increases was helping to dent copper and expected further downside pressure on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the late bounce copper remains under pressure after visiting levels below $2,300,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Aluminium was moved below expected support at $1,700 after an earlier period of stability. It earlier peaked at a 19-month high of $1,717.</p>
<p>Traders said aluminium's decline was a knee-jerk reaction to zinc and copper. It was last at $1,697, down $3. Nickel after racing to a high of $7,580 dived to end at $7,360, compared with $7,495.</p>
<p>Tin was last at $5,550, down $25 from its high but up on Tuesday's $5,410 close. Traders said tin earlier found support from buy-stops as it corrected from a recent oversold condition.</p>
<p>Lead was quiet and settled $3 lower at $632, while alloy was quoted at $1,510/20, down $5.</p>
