<p>Using river basins as the boundaries for water management plans, charging all water users and guaranteeing continued supplies should be key to future EU water policy, the European Commission said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Commission's long-awaited attempt to plug the gaps in EU water laws and beef up enforcement of existing rules sets 2010 as the deadline for achieving a &quot;good status&quot; for water quality above and below ground in the bloc's 15 countries.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a long time coming, I admit, but there has been a growing awareness of the need for a directive like this,&quot; Grant Lawrence, head of water policy at the Commission, told a news conference after the plan's adoption by the EU executive.</p>
<p>He refused to speculate which countries would have most to do in bringing their water quality up to scratch by 2010.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very difficult because the first step in applying the directive is to find out exactly where we are today...It may be that in some areas, no action will be necessary,&quot; he said, citing Finland, Sweden, Ireland, Scotland and large parts of France and Spain as places enjoying the highest quality water.</p>
<p>Water policy in the EU has suffered from lax implementation and a fragmented approach over the years with an array of rules covering water pollution from farm slurries, pesticides, industrial waste, chemicals and sewage as well as ones on the quality of water for drinking, bathing and even fish farming.</p>
<p>There is similar variety in the problems countries face.</p>
<p>Britain, for example, has the task of modernising many of its sewage plants so as to end sea discharges of raw waste while France has problems with pollution from lead water pipes.</p>
<p>Germany, meanwhile, has the legacy of Rhine river pollution whereas southern EU members must juggle the conflicting demands for water from farming, tourism and the environment.</p>
<p>Lawrence said the definition of &quot;good&quot; quality in surface and underground water would combine the demands of existing and pending EU laws with the requirement that authorities ensure water in sufficient quantities and of a sufficient quality to support a wide range of plant and animal life.</p>
<p>He said time-limited exceptions would be allowed to the 2010 quality targets where natural conditions, such as low flow, prevented rapid improvements.</p>
<p>A second derogation, for what Lawrence called the &quot;Rotterdam harbour syndrome&quot; in reference to heavily polluted water in the Dutch port, would exclude bodies of water where quality was so bad as to make clean-up costs exorbitant.</p>
<p>In such cases, countries would have to ensure at the very least that water quality did not deteriorate further.</p>
<p>The draft directive, which must be approved by national governments and the European Parliament, says a &quot;sustainable&quot; EU water policy must also ensure sufficient water for economic requirements, environmental protection and must alleviate the effects of floods and droughts.</p>
<p>If adopted, the draft would require water to be managed according to river basins using basin assessments, monitoring of water quality above and below ground, the set up of programmes to meet the &quot;good&quot; quality objectives and the summary of this work into basin management plans.</p>
<p>These plans, to be drawn up with public consultation, would include charging mechanisms to ensure that water use is paid for at &quot;full-cost recovery prices&quot;, including costs of fresh water abstraction and distribution and for waste water collection and treatment.</p>
<p>Authorities would have to identify all bodies of water used for drinking water abstraction and set quality standards which would include consideration of how much could be drawn.</p>
<p>The Commission also plans a proposal to charge users the full costs of the environmental damage associated with their water use, a calculation Lawrence said it had yet to fathom.</p>
<p>He said the question of guarantees or compensation for existing abstraction-rights holders would be a matter for countries to sort out in negotiations.</p>
