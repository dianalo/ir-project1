<p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers Friday warned Japan against trying to export its way out of its economic problems and urged it to restore domestic demand-led growth and repair its financial system.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery to the Japan-American Society, Summers also said the United States will continue to press Japan to open up its markets, with America's focus first on ensuring that Tokyo lives up to past trade agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;Too often in the past we have seen cycles in which Japan's trade surplus has declined with consequent reductions in trade frictions only to rise again,&quot; the Treasury official said. &quot;It is critically important to all of us that we avoid a repeat of this phenonmenon.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan has halved its trade surplus since 1994 -- a development that Summers called &quot;encouraging&quot; -- and attributed both to Tokyo's promotion of domestic demand and its efforts to liberalize trade and restructure its economy.</p>
<p>To prevent that progress from unravelling, Summers said that it was &quot;essential&quot; for Japan to restore domestic-demand led growth. That means adopting economic policies that restore confidence and working as rapidly as possible to repair the problems of Japan's financial system, he said.  </p>
<p>After spurting in the early part of last year, Japan's economic growth has sputtered.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are particularly worried that Tokyo's plans to tighten budget policy, including raising consumption taxes in April, could further undermine growth -- a concern that Summers alluded to in his speech.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important that Japan carefully assess the underlying strength of domestic demand and in that context that it determine the appropriate pace of fiscal consolidation,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>The Treasury official argued that Japan's underlying structural budget deficit is &quot;relatively modest&quot; and noted that Tokyo has the ability to pursue a flexible fiscal stance if dictated by changing economic conditions.</p>
<p>Summers said that the measures Japan is taking to strengthen its banking system look &quot;very encouraging&quot; and he voiced hopes that they would be put in place quickly.</p>
<p>The Treasury official took issue with those who argue that Japan's plan for a &quot;Big Bang&quot; package of financial reforms will shake its financial system.  </p>
<p>&quot;The problems of the Japanese financial system at present are due more to a record of slow, uneven, ambivalent reform efforts rather than efforts of excess speed in getting the bureaucrats out of the way of the market,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>He said Japan &quot;has a ways to go&quot; in bringing transparency and disclosure in its financial system up to world standards.</p>
<p>Reviewing the past four years of dealing with Japan, Summers said &quot;real progress&quot; has been made in putting the bilateral relationship back into better balance and gave the &quot;framework&quot; agreement between the two part of the credit.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States has proven that it is &quot;uniquely competitive&quot; in world markets, Summers said.</p>
<p>&quot;On a sectoral level, the United States is leading in almost every variety of post-industrial activity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Summers said the United States will continue to work to resolve the several trade problems that remain with Japan and be prepared to take appropriate action in response to any new problems that come up in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Where these problems are amenable to a multilateral solution or can be addressed by the WTO (World Trade Organization), this administration will be creative and pragmatic in pursuing those avenues,&quot; Summers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But wherever necessary, we will be prepared to pursue our interest directly with the Japanese government,&quot; he added.</p>
