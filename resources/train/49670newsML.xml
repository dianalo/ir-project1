<p>Turkey is providing aircraft to help the United States airlift 2,500 Americans, Kurds and Iraqi dissidents out of northern Iraq, Ankara's ambassador to Washington said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The envoy, Nuzhet Kandemir, also said that since force seems to have failed to tame Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the world should try a new strategy such as offering to treat Iraq &quot;properly within the community of nations.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately in some of the newspapers today there are complaints about the lack of cooperation from the Turkish side ... This is not true at all,&quot; Kandemir said at a lunch he hosted for Washington-based reporters.</p>
<p>He said Ankara had been in full consultations with the Americans and knew early on in the current crisis with Baghdad that certain individuals involved in the U.S. effort in northern Iraq to provide humanitarian aid to Kurds and mount an opposition to Saddam would have to be evacuated.</p>
<p>&quot;From the very beginning we have been asked by the American administration to provide them with military planes, which we did -- C-130s ... We are still providing them with any assistance that might be needed,&quot; the envoy said.</p>
<p>He said the operation is still underway and is likely to last a few more days. Any delay on the Turkish side resulted because the operation is complicated and &quot;we could not have started such a big and sensitive operation without knowing the details and talking to each other.&quot;</p>
