<p>The U.S. airlifted Americans and other foreigners from Tirana on Saturday and hundreds of Albanians fled to Italy by boat as the West agonised over whether to intervene to end the anarchy.</p>
<p>The situation was notably calmer in the capital after the government boosted the pay of police and sent them around town in armoured cars in a show of force designed to show that law and order was being restored.</p>
<p>But unrest continued in the port of Durres, 30 km (20 miles) from Tirana, where thousands of Albanians broke through police lines in a desperate attempt to board a Greek frigate that had come to evacuate foreign diplomats.</p>
<p>After weeks of anarchy following the collapse of shady investment schemes in which thousands of Albanians lost their savings, President Sali Berisha came under international pressure to quit, a key demand of rebels in the south.</p>
<p>Italy, Albania's biggest economic partner and a leading player in international efforts to halt the country's slide into chaos, signalled that Berisha was no longer a key player and his fate was in the hands of Prime Minister Bashkim Fino.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini told the newspaper La Repubblica that Fino had to decide whether Berisha's presence was &quot;an obstacle to pacifying the country or not, whether his continuation in the role can be accepted at least to prepare elections or not&quot;.</p>
<p>In the Dutch town of Apeldoorn, where European Union foreign ministers were discussing the crisis, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said Berisha should resign.</p>
<p>Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, attending the meeting, told reporters later he had heard reports that Berisha had resigned.</p>
<p>But in a statement in Tirana quoted by Albanian state television, Berisha said he had no intention of resigning, saying he would move forward with a programme to hold elections under an all-party government appointed last week.</p>
<p>In Vienna, ambassadors of the 54-nation Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) agreed to give broad support to sending foreign troops to Albania to help restore order.</p>
<p>But several leading members of the group are reluctant to get involved in the Albanian crisis.</p>
<p>Italian Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta said military intervention would require the support of rebels as well as the government and added he was not prepared to &quot;see Italian soldiers die&quot;.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel warned against hasty intervention and said: &quot;German soldiers will not go into Albania.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can't get involved in another adventure,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>However the EU did agree on Saturday to send a mission to Albania immediately to help in reconstruction and to consider providing a small police force to the shattered country.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Dini said the police force would be sent if the EU received a mandate from the United Nations, emphasising that the force was not the same as military intervention.</p>
<p>Italy, faced with an influx of 1,600 Albanians in the past few days, said it would give temporary sanctuary to refugees but intended to repatriate them once the armed anarchy in their country had subsided.</p>
<p>The exodus has raised fears in Italy of a repeat of the tide of 40,000 Albanians who flooded into southeast ports and sparked serious rioting in 1991 after Stalinist rule crumbled in Europe's poorest state.</p>
<p>In Durres, where diplomats and foreign nationals have been evacuated over the past few days, police fired in the air to try and hold back a crowd of 5,000 Albanians desperate to board a Greek warship.</p>
<p>But after running two km (one mile) through the port, they reached the quayside just in time to see the ship steaming away.</p>
<p>The U.S. evacuation, suspended on Friday after two Marine Cobra helicopters were fired on, restarted at dawn on Saturday and by midday more than 120 people had been brought out.</p>
