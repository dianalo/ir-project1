<title>UK: N.Sea crudes steady, Brent differentials stable.</title>
<headline>N.Sea crudes steady, Brent differentials stable.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>North Sea crude prices were holding steady at the lower levels with a more balanced physical market improving outright values for Brent.</p>
<p>Traders said Brent spot and paper markets were holding steady at the lower levels in late trade with the end-Jan and early-Feb loading cargoes slowly getting cleared.</p>
<p>Some traders said that the pricing strategies between two U.S. trade houses, were keeping Dated Brent values artificially low.</p>
<p>A Jan 25-27 loading Brent cargo was heard traded between the two players but details of the price could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>But the level was thought to have been better than Feb Brent -24 cents, the level of recent deals.</p>
<p>After a flurry of trade in the low thirties for late Jan and early Feb cargoes on Wednesday, some traders considered the Forties market under-valued in relation to Dated Brent.</p>
<p>A further cargo which traded on Thursday at Dated Brent -30 cents appeared to confirm the lower level.</p>
<p>No Brent Dates were due to turn wet on Thursday. The first dates from the February programme will emerge on Friday.</p>
<p>CFDs for next week were holding around March Brent +12/+16 cents with the following week talked at +10/+17 cents.</p>
<p>Differentials for other North Sea grades such as Oseberg and Statfjord were supported by the knock-on effect of production problems at Norway's Ekofisk field.</p>
<p>Ekofisk operator Phillips said on Thursday that it expected to resume production at the 350,000 barrel per day field at the weekend after it was shut in early on Tuesday because of a gas leak in a pipeline.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads traded in a narrow range with Feb/Mar done at +33 cents, up to +35 cents and holding +32/34 cents in late trade. March/April talked steady at +42/45 and April/May traded at +45 cents.</p>
