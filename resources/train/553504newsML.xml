<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodia expels suspected Chinese human trafficker.</title>

<p>Cambodian police on Thursday expelled a Hong Kong man suspected of involvement in human trafficking but said they could not afford to send him to the British colony.</p>
<p>Police placed Chan Yui-chun on an Air Vietnam flight to Hanoi and General Skadavy M. Ly Roun, head of the Cambodian Interpol department, said he would be taken to Guangzhou in southern China.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want him here,&quot; the police general told Reuters, adding that he had the authorisation of co-Interior Minister Sar Kheng and National Police chief Hok Lundi to expel Chan, who was arrested in Phnom Penh on Wednesday.</p>
<p>General Skadavy M. Ly Roun had first arrested Chan and two other alleged leaders of a human trafficking network during a December 25 raid in Phnom Penh that also netted around 80 Chinese hoping to reach other countries through Cambodia.</p>
<p>Hong Kong police twice came to Cambodia to interview Chan and an alleged co-conspirator who was a fugitive from justice in the British colony. They expected they would be deported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But a court released Chan after he had spent about three months in detention for immigration offences and made no order for him to be expelled as police had hoped.</p>
<p>Police skirted the judiciary by expelling Chan before they were forced by law to bring him before a court following his latest arrest, and he was never formally charged.</p>
<p>Skadavy told Reuters his department did not have enough money to send him to Hong Kong, but Chan wanted to go to Guangzhou and the tickets were paid by him or his friends.</p>
<p>Skadavy said he had informed Interpol in Hanoi and Guangzhou and hoped that Chan would eventually be sent to Hong Kong, but his main priority was simply to get him out of the country.</p>
<p>The illegal immigrants arrested with Chan were expelled but he was allowed to stay. Court authorities have denied bribery in the case.</p>
<p>&quot;Our immigration law does not work,&quot; said Skadavy, adding that the court &quot;gave him only three months -- they need to keep him at least five years&quot;.</p>
<p>The general, in a written statement, accused Chan of seeking revenge on his Interpol office, purchasing weapons, reorganising a human trafficking ring and bringing Hong Kong gangsters to Cambodia.</p>
<p>He said police had found six guns and three grenades at his home. &quot;This person is very dangerous for Cambodian society,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Cambodian authorities fear that the country, with its lax legal structure and weak law enforcement agencies, has become a haven for criminals on the run from their own countries.</p>
