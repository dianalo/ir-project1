<p>An old man weeps and wails over the grave of five dead relatives, and begins to sing a lullaby in the snow for his six-year-old granddaughter.</p>
<p>&quot;I had bought a red dress for you. Where are you now, Samileh?&quot;</p>
<p>An Iranian Red Crescent truck has just returned 10 bodies wrapped in white sheets in the traditional Islamic style. Six of them were children.</p>
<p>People gather around crying as they look for the bodies of their loved ones killed in Friday's earthquake in which more than 554 people died.</p>
<p>Separate graves are dug and after a final identity check the victims are buried in a ceremony performed by a mullah, or Moslem clergyman.</p>
<p>The old man's lament is one of scores of poignant scenes in Iran's mountainous northwest, where more than 35,000 people have been left homeless in harsh, winter conditions by an earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>Several aftershocks, including one on Sunday night, have also spread panic among survivors. The government has confirmed the deaths of 554 people and injury to 2,000.</p>
<p>A young man in this village, 60 km (37 miles) southwest of the provincial capital Ardabil, is held back by two others and yells: &quot;Oh, God. My back is broken. How can I survive this?&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a middle-aged man standing amid the rubble of his partly destroyed house cries for his two sheep beneath the debris.</p>
<p>&quot;They are alive. I can hear them. Their backs are broken and I cannot bring them out all by myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Another villager says, &quot;I think there must be hundreds of bodies under the rubble in the nearby villages.&quot;</p>
<p>Friday's quake caused heavy damage to 110 villages in the agricultural region bordering Azerbaijan. The region is inhabited mostly by Iran's Azeri minority.</p>
<p>Snow is falling and most of the mud-built houses are destroyed or damaged.</p>
<p>An army of 5,000 relief workers has set up 6,000 tents in temporary settlements to help survivors in dozens of frozen, devastated villages. They distributed blankets, heaters, bread, dates and canned fruit.</p>
