<p>Pen pictures of the women's favourites for next week's Wimbledon championships:</p>
<p>MARTINA HINGIS (Switzerland) - WTA ranking 1. Wimbledon seeding 1. Age 16. Height 1.67 m. Weight 52 kg. Grand Slam victories: Australian Open (1997). Best Wimbledon result: 4th round 1996.</p>
<p>Became the youngest Grand Slam champion in the Open era when she won the Australian Open in January. Took over as world number one from Steffi Graf in March. Hingis has had little preparation for Wimbledon's grass courts as she went home to rest after her disappointing straight-sets loss to Iva Majoli in the French Open final earlier this month. Competed in Paris despite not being fully fit after injuring her knee when she fell off a horse in April. Last year became youngest-ever Wimbledon champion when she won the women's doubles with Helena Sukova. Czech-born but moved to Switzerland as a child. Named after Martina Navratilova by mother Melanie who is also her coach.</p>
<p>MONICA SELES (U.S.) - WTA ranking 2. Seeding 2. Age 23. Height 1.79 m. Weight 65 kg. Grand Slam victories: Australian Open (1991, 1992, 1993, 1996), French Open (1990, 1991, 1992) U.S. Open (1991, 1992). Best Wimbledon result: runner-up 1992.</p>
<p>The former world number one spent more than two years out of tennis after being stabbed in the back by a spectator during a tournament in Hamburg in 1993. Since her comeback she has been hampered by injuries including a broken finger, tendinitis in a shoulder and a strained Achilles tendon. Has earned more than $9 million in her career. Born in former Yugoslavia and became an American citizen in 1994.</p>
<p>IVA MAJOLI (Croatia) - WTA ranking 5. Seeding 4. Age 19. Height 1.73 m. Weight 61 kg. Grand Slam victories: French Open 1997. Best Wimbledon result: 1st round 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>Became the first Croatian winner of a Grand Slam singles title with victory at the French Open earlier this month when she beat Hingis in the final. Was the lowest-seeded player to win the French title in the open era -- ninth. Product of the Nick Bollettieri tennis academy. Made her Grand Slam debut at age of 15 in 1992. Energetic, baseline player. Lost in the third round of the Eastbourne grasscourt tournament this week.</p>
<p>MARY PIERCE (France) - WTA ranking 10. Seeding 9. Age 22. Height 1.80 m. Weight 61 kgs. Grand Slam victories: Australian Open 1995. Best Wimbledon result: Quarter-finals 1996.</p>
<p>The hard-hitting, glamorous, Canadian-born Pierce was runner-up in the Australian Open in January but lost in the fourth round of the French Open. Won the Italian Open in May. A stormy relationship with her father who was also her coach overshadowed her early professional career until he was banned by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) from attending her matches after an outburst from the stands during the 1993 French Open. Made her debut on the tour at 14. Fidgety player who sometimes has concentration problems.</p>
<p>JANA NOVOTNA (Czech Republic) - WTA ranking 4. Seeding 3. Age 28. Height 1.75 m. Weight 63 kg. Grand Slam victories: None. Best Wimbledon result: runner-up 1993.</p>
<p>Beat Seles in Madrid Open final in May. Lost in third round of the French Open to unseeded Nicole Arendt of the U.S. Has been a sentimental favourite at Wimbledon since she won hearts by sobbing on Duchess of Kent's shoulder after losing final to Steffi Graf when she had been within reach of victory.</p>
<p>ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO (Spain) - WTA ranking 9. Seeding 8. Age 25. Height 1.69 m. Weight 56 kg. Grand Slam victories: French Open 1989, 1994. U.S. Open 1994. Best Wimbledon result: runner-up 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>Has won more than $11.6 million in her career. In 1995 became first Spanish player to hold the world number one ranking in the open era. Won the 1989 French Open at age of 17 years six months -- a record at the time. Lost to Hingis in this year's French Open quarter-finals. Brothers Emilio and Javier played on the men's tour.</p>
<p>CONCHITA MARTINEZ (Spain) - WTA ranking 11. Seeding 10. Age 25. Height 1.70 m. Weight 59 kg. Grand Slam victories: Wimbledon 1994.</p>
<p>Foiled Martina Navratilova's bid for a 10th Wimbledon title by beating her in the 1994 final to become the first Spanish women to win the event. Beaten in fourth round of French Open by Amanda Coetzer of South Africa. Had a record run of four consecutive Italian Open titles until she was defeated in this year's final by Pierce.</p>
<p>VENUS WILLIAMS (U.S.) - WTA ranking 80. Unseeded at Wimbledon. Age 17. Height 1.86 m. Weight 62 kgs. Grand Slam victories: None. Best Wimbledon result: Not played before.</p>
<p>Though she has played only four matches on grass, the tall, striking Williams will be one of the biggest draws at Wimbledon with her eye-catching outfits and heavily-beaded braids. An exciting new talent, she has been introduced gradually to the professional tour under the watchful guidance of her father and coach Richard. Made her major tournament debut at French Open in May, defeating Naoko Sawamatsu in first round before falling to Nathalie Tauziat. Beaten by Tauziat again in second round of Eastbourne grasscourt tournament this week.</p>
