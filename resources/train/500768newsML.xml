<title>FRANCE: Strikes hit French air traffic, press, hospitals.</title>
<headline>Strikes hit French air traffic, press, hospitals.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-10</dateline>

<p>Strikes disrupted French air traffic and state hospitals on Thursday, and most newspapers failed to appear as printers joined in the labour unrest.</p>
<p>Cockpit crew unions at British Airways' French units Air Liberte and TAT said they decided to indefinitely extend a strike, begun Wednesday, over pay and working conditions.</p>
<p>The job action, which had been due to end at noon (1000 GMT) on Friday, cut the airlines' flights by half on Thursday.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the airlines said TAT, a domestic airline, guaranteed 91 of 180 scheduled flights, and Air Liberte, which flies around the world, would cancel 33 of its 60 flights but would operate all long-haul flights.</p>
<p>The strikers marched in protest to the headquarters of Air Liberte at Paris' Orly airport, blocking the motorway to the terminal for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Unions, protesting over pay and conditions which they say will be affected by a merger of the two airlines, urged management to negotiate. Marc Rochet, chairman of the two units, has rejected demands for reforms which he said would raise costs by 18 percent.</p>
<p>National newspapers were absent from newsstands while a few regional titles appeared as normal. Some dailies were available on the Internet computer network even if they did not make it onto paper.</p>
<p>The printers' branch of the Communist-led CGT union called the 24-hour strike to protest at cuts in state subsidies to the media, suppression of tax breaks and rising postal charges.</p>
<p>It also demanded retirement at 55 instead of at 60, a move the CGT says will help cut record 12.8 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>Junior hospital doctors kept up a strike, now in its fifth week, although their representatives met aides of Social Affairs Minister Jacques Barrot overnight and both sides said some progress was made on the dispute.</p>
<p>The strikers have called a protest march in Paris on Sunday and a new &quot;health blackout&quot; day, in which they ask other doctors to join them in giving only emergency care, on Monday.</p>
<p>They are protesting against government plans to fine doctors exceeding pre-set spending targets, in order to curb health outlays and plug a gaping welfare deficit.</p>
<p>The doctors' dispute, like demands for early retirement, are testing the conservative government's determination to cut public deficits to qualify for the European Union's planned single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Bank unions protested at a government decree extending the banks' working hours and called on members to be militant to help them win concessions.</p>
<p>The decree, passed on Wednesday, ditched a 60-year-old rule limiting the banks' working day to eight hours and obliging them to close at weekends. It allows them to be open six days a week, and from 7.30 in the morning to 8.30 at night.</p>
