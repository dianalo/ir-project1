<p>German coffee roasters are staying out of the raw materials market for now because they are hoping for further futures falls, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>New York arabica futures had a good chance of extending a reversal on profit-taking, which quickly followed new highs on the nearby contracts last week, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't seen all of the likely downward correction... nevertheless prices will remain at high levels this year because of tight physical supply,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Others agreed futures might pull back in a correction to rapid gains over the last six weeks and supported by encouraging supply fundamentals news from a number of Latin American countries.</p>
<p>New York March ended at 174.80 cents/lb, off 3.65, and May at 161.85, off 4.55, last Friday.</p>
<p>Traders believed the market could shed another 10 or 20 cents but this would still be well up from early 1997.</p>
<p>On the demand side, roasters were focusing on retail markets, where they plan to raise roasted coffee prices by around 1.50 marks per 0.5 kg from March 10.</p>
<p>&quot;A certain amount of hoarding is going on at the moment in anticipation of the price rises and this is boosting roastings,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the coffee firms are worried consumption might drop once the increases become effective.&quot;</p>
<p>Roasters' costs have risen by up to 70 percent since December amid futures rallies and dollar firmness, market leader Kraft Jacobs Suchard said last Friday in a statement justifying the price increases.</p>
<p>In the Northern German import markets, arabica prices were $4-7 down on the week per 50 kg fob but Colombia excelso was up $2 at $212.</p>
<p>Brazils were at $179 fob and Vietnam robustas at $68 cif.</p>
<p>Consumers last week bought some Brazilian and central American arabicas and robustas from all origins for 1997 as well as African and Asian arabicas for the first half.</p>
<p>Importers expected the Kenyan coffee season to end earlier than in recent years because of a smaller crop.</p>
<p>Sales volumes and prices at the next auction were expected to be high and Ethiopian and Zimbabwean prices were also seen benefiting from that. -Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275</p>
