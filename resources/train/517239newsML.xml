<p>A British woman who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for trying to smuggle heroin out of Thailand won approval on Thursday to serve the remainder of her sentence in Britain, a Thai official said.</p>
<p>It should take about two weeks for the details to be worked out and then Sandra Gregory can return to Britain, Kukiat Sunthornbura, permanent secretary of Thailand's Justice Ministry, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said officials from the Corrections Department and the Police Department would work out the extradition process as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Kukiat's comments were made after a special 10-member committee approved a request made by Gregory to be sent back to her home country to finish her sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the process will be completed in about one or two weeks,&quot; Kukiat said.</p>
<p>He said Gregory, 31, from Halifax, northern England, had already served four years and two months of her sentence.</p>
<p>Under Thai law, a foreign prisoner who has served a certain amount of time in Thailand can apply to be sent home to serve the rest of the sentence. The number of years varies according to the charges.</p>
<p>The appeal to return home was made on Gregory's behalf by the British Embassy, court documents showed.</p>
<p>In February 1996, Gregory was sentenced to 25 years in jail for heroin smuggling. An original death sentence was commuted because she had confessed.</p>
<p>Gregory was detained along with Robert Lock, from Cambridge, in February 1993 as they were about to board a flight to Japan.</p>
<p>She was found with 102 grams (3.6 ounces) of heroin in her possession.</p>
<p>Gregory pleaded guilty but told the court that Lock had paid her to smuggle the heroin out of Thailand. Lock was found not guilty in last year's hearing.</p>
<p>A British Embassy spokesman told Reuters that the mission was satisfied with the way the Thai authorities were handling the case.</p>
<p>&quot;The British Embassy supported Sandra Gregory's transfer application since it was lodged, as we would that of any British prisoner who sought a transfer under an existing transfer agreement,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased that the Thai authorities have been able to process Miss Gregory's application so quickly and efficiently,&quot; he said.</p>
