<p>Jakarta call money declined to 13.5/14.0 percent from an early high of 16.0 percent on Tuesday morning, with bond prices continuing to rise, dealers said.</p>
<p>One state bank dealer said fears of large weekly tax payments due Tuesday semed to keep operators nervous.</p>
<p>She said some banks seemed to have higher tax obligations due to the approaching fiscal year end on March 31.</p>
<p>Another local bank dealer said worry over tight conditions in the afternoon prevented operators from unloading rupiah, raising overnight money to a high of 16.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;But a relatively large commercial demand on dollars seems to have helped generate rupiah and trigger other operators to drop their rupiah retained earlier,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said longer-term rates were stable and the central bank kept interest rates for bilateral papers (SBIs) stable.</p>
<p>The bank offered three days SBIs at seven percent, 6-7 day at 8.5 percent, 8-10 day at 9.5 percent, 13-17 day at 10.0 percent, 20-24 day at 10.5 percent, one-month at 11.5 percent, three-, six- and 12-month at 12.25, 12.50 and 12.75 percent.</p>
<p>One- and three-month money were quoted at 12.50/12.75 and 13.25/13.50 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Bond prices continued their uptrend averaging 25 to 100 basis points, keeping further pressure on the average yield.</p>
<p>One bond dealer said the yield of the benchmark PLN V/A bond declined to 15.37 percent at its last traded price of 105.25 percent, approaching the grey market yield of the 400 billion rupiah Astra International bonds.</p>
<p>He said the grey market price of Astra hovered at 100.5 percent, reflecting a yield of about 15.35 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some anticipation the benchmark yield of PLN might head towards the 15.0 percent level,&quot; the dealer said, adding that it would be equivalent to 106.5 percent.</p>
<p>The average overnight interbank rate on Monday was 15.02 percent, compared with 21.52 percent on Friday.</p>
