<headline>IPE gas oil ends up on day despite Iraqi news.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>IPE gas oil ended Monday on a slightly firmer note despite news that the U.N. had approved a distribution plan for humanitarian supplies to Iraq.</p>
<p>The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan backed the plan, which was needed before Iraq would resume exporting oil.</p>
<p>Crude prices tipped upwards following the news as traders who had shorted the market came in to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knew the headline was going to come out and had shorted the market and came in to buy it. We don't know anything now that we didn't know a month ago - so we'll have Iraqi crude again by mid-August or earlier. It's not really news,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>August gas oil closed on Monday up 75 cents at $172.25 a tonne.</p>
<p>The prompt September Brent crude oil contract broke through resistance at $19.00 to trade up nine cents at $19.04 a barrel at 1722 GMT, just four cents off the intra-day high.</p>
<p>Strength continued on NYMEX gasoline which gained 0.88 cents to trade at 65.95 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>The contract was supported by supply tightness in New York Harbour and on talk two major players were having difficulty finding barrels to deliver after being short the August gasoline contract which expired Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline rules the world. The gasoline charts keep the thing going. It's very strong,&quot; one London based crude oil trader said.</p>
<p>Refinery problems on both sides of the Atlantic combined with good gasoline demand to leave a market short prompt gasoline, he added.</p>
