<title>USA: BPA attributes lack of peak power to line outage.</title>
<headline>BPA attributes lack of peak power to line outage.</headline>

<p>Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) decision to refrain from offering next-day surplus power during peak demand hours was related to outage of a major transmission line, BPA sources said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are being told to restrict generation on the east side of the Cascades because there is a limit on what the lines can carry over to the west side,&quot; a BPA trader said.</p>
<p>On Friday, a 500 kilovolt line running between Snohomish County, Wash., and the Canadian border was damaged by an ice storm.</p>
<p>Since then, power has been rerouted to other lines, which would be in danger of overloading if generation was maintained at recent high levels, the BPA source said.</p>
<p>A BPA spokeswoman said Tuesday repairs to the line may not be finished until early next week, but BPA trade sources said the restrictions may end as early as Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>In addition, the unplanned outage of a 750 MW power turbine at the Grand Coulee dam in Washington on Tuesday added to BPA's lack of surplus power.</p>
<p>The Grand Coulee unit is expected to return to service later Wednesday.</p>
<p>The BPA trader noted forecasts for cooler weather next week may keep surplus supplies tight.</p>
<p>The agency has also sought to sell more power under term contracts and block deals this year, adding to the smaller volumes of surplus power sales.</p>
