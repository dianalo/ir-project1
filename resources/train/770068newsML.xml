<p>San Miguel Corp (SMC) of the Philippines will find it hard to post stronger profits this year because of a declining peso and lower beer prices, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Margins will definitely be sacrificed from lower beer prices. The depreciation of the peso would impact on raw material costs plus consumers will be squeezed because inflation would move up,&quot; said an analyst of a foreign brokerage house, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were largely disappointed with the earnings performance of SMC, which earlier on Thursday reported a 20 percent rise in first half net income to 2.89 billion pesos from the year-ago 2.41 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Raul Ruiz, vice president of Sun Hung Kai Securities, said he would likely maintain a lower net profit forecast for SMC this year at a recurring 4.6 billion pesos compared with last year's 5.3 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Second quarter profits were mostly shored up by a deal with Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA), analysts said. In April this year, SMC exchanged its 70 percent stake in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc (CCBPI) for a 25 percent equity in CCA.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of exceptional items. The second quarter was down year-on-year,&quot; another analyst said.</p>
<p>SMC said its soft drinks interest delivered total profits of 651 million pesos, of which 560 million pesos came from the sale on inventories of packaging products to CCBPI.</p>
<p>For the rest of the year, SMC would have to grapple with the effects of the peso on its imported raw material prices, foreign currency loan payments and lower spending power of consumers which would impact on margins and sales, analysts said.</p>
<p>The peso was devalued three weeks ago when it fell prey to currency speculation in the region caused by Thailand's financial woes.</p>
<p>But Raphael Manalaysay, research head of Socgen-Crosby UBP Securities, said investors should not be too worried about the impact of the peso.</p>
<p>&quot;SMC has forward contracts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Also, he said SMC had earnings from abroad which should take care of its foreign exchange costs. Its international operations on beer and packaging account for 15 percent of revenues, he said.</p>
<p>SMC's decision to cut beer prices in July would result in lower margins but SMC had said it hoped to offset this with a 20 percent increase in volume of domestic beer sales. Analysts said this segment accounted for 31 percent of revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be a pleasant surprise from domestic beer sales,&quot; Manalaysay said. &quot;There seems to be encouraging signs of increased take-up from the price adjustments.&quot;</p>
<p>Socgen-Crosby so far projected SMC to post a net income of 4.74 billion pesos this year.</p>
