<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The emerging debt market was well bid across the board on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Russia and Bulgaria were especially firm amid good news and Latin American bonds were up, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a better tone in U.S. Treasuries, ongoing investor demand and the fundamentals continue strong,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said: &quot;The whole market has been well bid generally.&quot;</p>
<p>News that Bulgaria will peg the national lev currency to the mark as anchor in a currency board system to be launched July 1, at a fixed exchange rate of 1,000, was lifting debt, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors have taken this as good news,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria FLRB  were up 0.375 point at  52.75 bid. Bulgaria IAB  were up 0.375 point at 68.625 bid and Bulgaria DISC were up 0.375 at 69.375.</p>
<p>Russian VN US$ were 0.5 point up at 87.50 bid amid expectations of further positive news between Russia and the London Club following meetings in Frankfurt today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Latin America, dealers said they were awaiting further details on Brazil's swap deal.</p>
<p>Overnight in New York, Brazil set a minimum yield of 9.946 percent for its $1.0 billion global bond issue, via joint lead managers Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Brazil's debt swap allows investors to tender their par bonds, discount bond or C bond for the 30-year global bond issue or to purchase outright the new issue.</p>
<p>The invitation is scheduled to expire at 1500 EDT/1900 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brazil IDUS  were bid at 98.50, Brazil &quot;C&quot; were bid at 79.625 and Brazil PAR were bid at 66.50.</p>
