<p>New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch on Tuesday said the country was currently at the bottom of its economic cycle but predicted economic growth of at least 4.0 percent in 1998-99.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, New Zealand is bumping along the trough at the bottom of the current economic cycle,&quot; Birch said in a speech to Commerce Nelson.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy hasn't kick-started since Christmas the way some people thought it might.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said lower growth this year would reduce inflationary pressure and help exporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'll see lagged benefits from the 3.0 percent fall we've had in interest rates since the middle of last year, and from our more stable exchange rate,&quot; Birch said.</p>
<p>He said in July 1998, phase two of the reduction in the middle rate of income tax would come through, along with a further significant increase in governement spending.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF is forecasting average world growth at more than 4.0 percent for this and next year. That creates expanding opportunities world-wide for New Zealand exporters,&quot; Birch said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I fully expect, in 1998-99, to see our own economy match that world average of 4.0 percent or better, with strong sustained growth continuing in New Zealand afterwards, beyond the year 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the government needed to take quite seriously the fact that there had been &quot;some drift&quot; in business confidence, and act to repair that, he said.</p>
