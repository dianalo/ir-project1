<p>Actress Brooke Shields and tennis star Andre Agassi were married on Saturday in a quiet ceremony in a small chapel with about 100 friends and family members present.</p>
<p>Shields, a child model who went on to be one of Hollywood's darlings of the 1970s and 1980s and who foresook stardom to study at Princeton University, wore a white gown with a long train.</p>
<p>She is currently starring in the NBC situation-comedy series &quot;Suddenly Susan.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the first marriage for both Shields and Agassi. After the ceremony the couple held a reception at the posh Stonepine resort in nearby Carmel Valley, where they had booked all 12 luxury cottages and the four-star restaurant for the occasion.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony was conducted by Roman Catholic priest Father Charles Gard, a friend of Shields' family, at St. John's Episcopal Church, located on the Del Monte golf course, California's oldest golf course.</p>
<p>A member of Shields' family told reporters they chose the church because of its beauty.</p>
<p>The couple were escorted down the aisle by three bridesmaids wearing gold, backless dresses and Shields, with her blonde hair combed straight back, smiled as she prepared to take her wedding vows, guests at the ceremony told reporters.</p>
<p>Shields, 31, who found stardom as a teenager, most notably for her role in the 1980 movie, &quot;The Blue Lagoon,&quot; and Agassi, 26, once ranked the world's number one tennis player, were engaged for two years before their marriage.</p>
