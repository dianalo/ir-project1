<headline>Turk miller's flour sale to Iraq hits customs snag.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Turkish flour miller and trading company, Besler, said on Wednesday its pledge to sell Iraq 14,000 tonnes of wheat flour was being hampered by formalities at customs in southeast Turkey.  </p>
<p>&quot;The customs centres near our storehouses in the southeast don't approve our export documents and that delays our sales,&quot; said Cemal Besler, general manager of the company.</p>
<p>&quot;Customs officials show no reason for their attitude despite promises in our favour by (State) Minister Ayfer Yilmaz and senior customs officials in Ankara,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said other companies with deals of &quot;at least 50,000 tonnes of flour&quot; were in the same situation.</p>
<p>Customs officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>The deals were to be carried out under normal humanitarian sales to Iraq under U.N. auspices, not under the continuing oil-for-food deal allowing Iraq to sell oil worth $2 billion to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>&quot;Our flour deal was priced at $330 per tonne and was going to be sent to Mosul in Iraq,&quot; Besler said.</p>
<p>Besler said customs offices in Nusaybin, at Turkey's border with Syria, and Cizre, near the Iraqi and Syrian borders, were not approving their export documents.</p>
<p>&quot;The office in Silopi (near Iraq) approves them but its far away from our storehouses, which are in Nusaybin,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government allows duty-free wheat imports by millers if they use the wheat to produce flour for export purposes only.</p>
<p>But if exporters do not document their sales, they cannot import wheat under the duty-free scheme.</p>
<p>Besler said the millers would have to pay fines if they failed to deliver the shipments to Iraq on time.</p>
