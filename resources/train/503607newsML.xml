<title>UK: Palladium rises again, other precious metals firm.</title>
<headline>Palladium rises again, other precious metals firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The price of palladium crawled back up again on Friday as some traders began to doubt whether Russia would be able to resume exports soon.</p>
<p>The price had dropped on Thursday on news that a Moscow official said that a decree that should enable delayed sales to resume to Japan, the biggest importer, would be signed next week.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed higher at $348.65 an ounce from Thursday's $347.60 with the focus shifting to the activity of shorts before an options expiry on the New York Comex market and the U.S. Producer Price Index at 1230 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Some evidence of increasing price pressure in the U.S. would be taken as being positive for the precious metals,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Dealers noted some buying emanating out of Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;Once we get past the Comex expiration I think it will be interesting to see what takes place. I have a feeling that we'll probably see gold break out of this very restrictive range,&quot; said one London dealer, adding that upside potential was capped.</p>
<p>Palladium, mainly used in electronics and autocatalysts, was borrowed heavily in Europe, pushing the one-month lease rates back up to double-digit figures from about nine percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The tightness is still there,&quot; said the dealer, adding that liquidation by some long holders had exacerbated a squeeze as less of that metal was now available for short-term lease.</p>
<p>&quot;The gamblers' money will go on a five buck rally again.&quot;</p>
<p>Palladium stood $2.75 up at $158.50/159.50 an ounce at 1045 GMT, but fought shy of Thursday's 21-month high fix of $160.25.</p>
<p>Even so wide price gyrations were expected to continue until there was final proof that Russian exports would resume.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it could fall dramatically in a major downward move and I would not be surprised to see $130-$140,&quot; one technical analyst said, forecasting a range of $153-$158 for today.</p>
<p>The rare white metal tumbled $5.00 on Thursday on news Russia would sign a long-awaited decree on exports, paving the way for shipments to begin in May after a four-month delay.</p>
<p>Its sister metal platinum spiked $3.50 up to $372.50 on Friday, a move analysts said was justified by constructive charts and the fact that prices held even as palladium fell.</p>
<p>Silver was firm at $4.79/$4.81 with little options-related activity expected as open interest was clustered above $5.00.</p>
<p>But with neither gold or silver responding to the heat generated by palladium, a move towards $4.65 support -- the April 3 low -- to suck in buying momentum might be necessary before a positive move was attempted, analysts said.</p>
<p>Gold could gravitate towards a test of $345.00. This was supported by technical indicators weakening slightly this week suggesting a test of support was to be expected.</p>
