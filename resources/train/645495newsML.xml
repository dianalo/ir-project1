<p>Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia secured their places in next year's World Cup finals after the penultimate series of African qualifiers at the weekend.</p>
<p>Morocco and Tunisia gained the single points they needed while Nigeria's 3-0 win over Kenya in Lagos on Saturday saw them secure top place in group one.</p>
<p>Morocco and Nigeria qualify for the World Cup for the second successive time while Tunisia will play in France 20 years after their last appearance at the World Cup finals in Argentina.</p>
<p>But in groups three and four the identity of the continent's two other representatives in the finals will not be decided until August 17 when the final round of qualifiers are played.</p>
<p>Cameroon and Angola will both need to win in group four while South Africa can finish top of group three if they draw at home with Congo in their last match.</p>
<p>Khalid Raghib's goal 13 minutes from time gave Morocco a 1-0 home win over Ghana on Saturday and an unassailable lead in group five. They became the first African side to qualify for the finals on four seperate occasions.</p>
<p>Tunisia forced a goalless draw away in Cairo against Egypt on Sunday night to book their trip while goals from Sunday Oliseh, Emmanuel Amunike and Wilson Oruma ensured Nigeria's progress.</p>
<p>South Africa hammered regional rivals Zambia 3-0 to go top of group three on goal difference from the Congo, who beat the newly-named Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) 1-0 in Pointe Noire.</p>
<p>Both teams have 10 points from five matches but the South African goal spree in Johannesburg on Sunday gives them a better goal difference and the comfortable option of a home draw against the Congo in August to qualify for the first time.</p>
<p>The South Africans scored two early goals through Helman Mkhalele and Italian-based Phil Masinga before Mark Williams added a third in the second half.</p>
<p>Angola squandered a succession of chances in their vital match against Cameroon on Sunday after coming from behind early in the second half.</p>
<p>Patrick Mboma, who plays his club soccer in Japan, put the 1990 World Cup quarter-finalists ahead only for Angolan teenager Akwa to equalise within 60 seconds.</p>
<p>But the hosts, roared on by a capacity crowd at Luanda's Citadela stadium, then threw away the chance to overtake Cameroon in the standings by missing a series of late opportunities.</p>
<p>Cameroon, seeking their fourth World Cup finals appearance, lead Angola by two points but must travel to Harare to play Zimbabwe in their final qualifier in August. Angola have an easier trip to Togo the same day.</p>
<p>Namibia and Togo secured their first wins of the qualifiers in other inconsequential games.</p>
<p>Namibia won their first-ever World Cup game by beating Liberia 2-1 away in Monrovia in group two, Gervatius Uri Khob scoring the winner 10 minutes from time.</p>
<p>Bundesliga-based striker Bachirou Salou scored twice in 20 minutes to take Togo to a 2-1 win over Zimbabwe in group four in Lome on Sunday.</p>
<p>Burkin Faso remain the only team in the African qualifiers without a point. They lost their fifth match in group one, going down 3-1 to Guinea in Conakry on Sunday despite taking an early lead.</p>
