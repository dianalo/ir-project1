<p>A Zimbabwean business group denounced on Friday a multi-million-dollar World Bank loan facility recently provided for small businesses, saying its conditions were too stringent to benefit the black majority.</p>
<p>Enock Kamushinda, secretary-general of the black economic empowerment Indigenous Business Development Centre (IBDC), called on the government to review the World Bank's $70 million facility.</p>
<p>The facility opened last month, and is available to applicants with at least some 20 percent of the required loan and repayable interest is around 24 percent -- six percent below the local market rate.</p>
<p>These conditions were too tough for many, Kamushinda said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The IBDC, which was at the forefront of negotiating the World Bank facility, is under pressure from its members to pull out of the programme and lead demonstrations against the facility,&quot; he said of the loan which is guaranteed by President Robert Mugabe's government.</p>
<p>Government and World Bank officials have told other critics that the loan facilities are fair.</p>
