<p>Dutch shares rebounded strongly on Monday, shrugging off any potential weakness feared in reaction to the French election result, and the AEX index of leading stocks climbed back well above 800 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dutch market held up very well,&quot; one dealer said, adding that trading volumes were not broadly high. &quot;It was quite surprising how resilient it was this morning,&quot; another added.</p>
<p>The AEX blue-chip index ended up 16.51 points, or 2.09 percent, at 807.48, building on early gains in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Most activity was seen in financial stocks, with banking groups ABN AMRO and ING topping the volume list.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO ended 90 cents firmer at 36.40 guilders and ING put on 2.20 to 87.10.</p>
<p>Outside the financial stocks, trading was more limited but dollar-sensitive issues fared well. Electronics giant Philips closed 4.90 guilders higher at 111.00 and Royal Dutch 6.70 up at 377.80 guilders.</p>
<p>One stock that continued to weaken was chemicals group Akzo Nobel, which tumbled nearly 13 guilders on Friday on a perceived profit slowdown at its pharmaceuticals division.</p>
<p>Depite the general market rally on Monday, Akzo fell another guilder to close at 254.70 guilders.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market move back above 800 points had improved its technical outlook, although they said it may not extend far beyond the all-time high reached on May 28 at 815.18.</p>
<p>ING Barings said in a worst case scenario, the index could possibly sink to touch 775 points, but any dip &quot;should provide a nice buying opportunity, given strong long-term technicals.&quot;</p>
