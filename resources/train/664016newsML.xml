<p>Attractive U.S. interest rates are luring corporate bond issuers into the primary arena as close to $4.0 billion is already slated to hit the market this week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Triggering the onslaught of corporate supply is the drop in interest rates following weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data last week.</p>
<p>Players said the reports confirmed that further tightening by the Federal Reserve is not imminent, therefore creating a window of opportunity for isuers to finance debt at lower levels.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're going to see a busy week,&quot; said one syndicate player. &quot;Rates have improved tremendously ... we should see those stil contemplating issuance come off the sidelines to take advantage of cheaper financing.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury yields have come down considerably in the last few weeks. The 30-year Treasury bond closed at a yield of 7.03 percent back on May 28th, but has since fallen to 6.71 percent.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, the policysetting arm of the Fed, is scheduled to meet on July 1 and 2 to vote on U.S. monetary policy.  </p>
<p>Old Republic International is expected to sell $115 million in Aa2/AA-minus rated 10-year debt via Lehman Brothers, players said.</p>
<p>Among global issuers, American Express is slated to tap the market with a $500 million A1/A-plus rated seven-year debt offering via Lehman Brothers, sources said.</p>
<p>Another $1.0 billion in AAA rated 10-year gobal debt is expected to come from Bayerische Landesbank via JP Morgan Securities and Merrill Lynch, players said.</p>
<p>Turning to the high-yield sector, about $1.7 billion in new debt is expected this week, sources said.</p>
