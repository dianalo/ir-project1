<title>POLAND: OPINION - POLAND'S PENSION REFORM PLAN DETAILED.</title>
<headline>OPINION - POLAND'S PENSION REFORM PLAN DETAILED.</headline>
<text>
<p>By Michal Rutkowski, Executive Director, Office of the Government Plenipotentiary for Social Security Reform</p>
<p>REFORMED POLISH PENSIONS ASSUME THREE-TIER SYSTEM</p>
<p>Although experts differ over the way the pension system in Poland is to be reformed, they share views on basic principles of the future pension funds' activity. The new system will be a combination of Western European, U.S. and South American models.</p>
<p>The reform plan now discussed by government experts assumes that the pension system will have three pillars.</p>
<p>The first (pay as you go) will be based on mandatory contributions, general participation and the value of benefits strictly linked to the value of contributions.</p>
<p>The second pillar will be a fully-funded, defined contribution system of privately-managed pension funds similar to the Chilean, Australian or Swiss concepts, while the third pillar will be voluntary.</p>
<p>PENSION FUND MANAGEMENT COMPANIES DETAILED</p>
<p>Poles will be able to join two types of pension funds: open funds as the mandatory part of the system operating as the second pillar's institutions, and sponsored pension funds being one of the institutions available in the third pillar.</p>
<p>Each fund will have to be managed by a separate, independent company, created after receiving a permit from the State Office of Supervision over Pension Funds (PUNFE).</p>
<p>A company managing an open pension fund will be a normal profit company. It is expected that banks, insurance firms and other financial institutions will play a dominant role among their shareholders but there are no formal restraints on who could become their shareholders.</p>
<p>Foreign financial institutions will be allowed to be among founders and shareholders of Universal Pension Funds societies, managing open pension funds, but during the first stage of the reforms they will not be allowed to have a majority portfolio.</p>
<p>Given the experience of Latin American countries, it can be expected that within the first few months after adoption of the law, 10 to 20 funds will win operating permits.</p>
<p>According to the draft, those funds will be allowed to start operation about nine months after adoption of the law.</p>
<p>Sponsored pension funds will be managed by non-profit companies, established by employers, groups of employers, chambers of commerce, employers' associations and professional organisations.</p>
<p>The companies managing pension funds, will operate as joint-stock companies and their share capital will have to amount to at least 10 million zlotys. The companies will not be allowed to hold shares (directly or through subsidiaries) in more than one Universal Pension Fund Society.</p>
<p>PLAN ASSUMES TRANSFER BETWEEN PENSION FUNDS</p>
<p>Any citizen will be free to join any open pension fund of choice, as well as to change funds at any time, but after paying at least eight months' contributions to the fund. In the case of sponsored pension funds the contributions can be made only by sponsors -- to the account of their employees.</p>
<p>Transfers to other funds will be permitted, subject to that member having preserved rights.</p>
<p>According to the draft of the law the minimum period before one is eligible to draw a pension will be decided by the creators of the sponsored fund, but it cannot be extended beyond three years from the first contribution.</p>
<p>One will only be allowed to take benefits from pension funds at state retirement age. They can be taken in the form of a transfer to an insurance company to purchase an annuity and, in the case of sponsored pension funds, it will also be possible to receive benefits directly from the fund, either as a lump sum or in instalments.</p>
<p>REFORM AIMS TO REGULATE FUND MANAGERS CLOSELY</p>
<p>The new law will specify in what instruments and in what proportions the funds' assets can be invested to secure a sufficient level of the funds's diversification and safety.</p>
<p>At least 90 percent of assets will have to be invested in publicly traded securities, in securities issued or guaranteed by the State Treasury or National Bank of Poland and in bank deposits. It will not be allowed to invest more than five percent of a fund's assets in the securities of any one issuer. It will not be allowed to invest any part of the open pension fund assets in shares or other securities issued by the firm managing the fund, its subsidiaries or its affiliates.</p>
<p>The new law will establish a state supervisory body called PUNFE to oversee and regulate the funds. One of the most important responsibilities of PUNFE will also be educating the public.</p>
<p>The most important part of the system is protection of members' interests. Apart from the establishment these will be also:</p>
<p>1/ A requirement to appoint a depository bank as custodian of the fund's assets, together with strict separation of the fund's assets from those of the fund managing company. Probably no more than 20 Polish banks will be able to meet the capital requirements to act as a depositary bank.</p>
<p>2/ Legal investment limitations which will prevent firms managing the pension funds from taking excessive risks.</p>
<p>3/ Disclosure requirements for Pension Fund Societies, which will be bound to report to the PUNFE, to publish regular reports and to send participants in the funds statements of their accounts and other basic information.</p>
<p>4/ Limitations in the marketing policy, resulting from the Chilean experience and aimed at capping current costs of Societies. For example the company managing the open fund and its shareholders will not be allowed to offer any participant of &quot;their&quot; fund additional privileges.</p>
<p>5/ The idea of the minimum required rate of return, borrowed from the South American model, which forces a Pension Fund Society to contribute its own money to the fund, if the rate of return achieved by the managed fund is significantly (more than 50 percent) below the weighted average rate of return achieved by all open pension funds within the last 24 months. This rate will be calculated every three months.</p>
<p>6/ Simple structure of members' fees, paid to the companies managing funds, which allow them to compare easily the costs of participation in each open fund.</p>
<p>7/ The establishment of a central guarantee fund, to which all societies will have to contribute and which will be used in the case of the bankruptcy of a company managing a fund, to cover all administrative costs needed to liquidate an open pension fund and to transfer participants to other funds.</p>
