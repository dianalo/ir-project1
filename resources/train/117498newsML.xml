<headline>U.N. calls for full observance of Korean armistice.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1996-10-15</dateline>

<p>The Security Council expressed serious concern on Tuesday over an incursion into South Korean waters last month by a North Korean submarine and called for strict observance of the armistice agreement.</p>
<p>The submarine landed 26 North Koreans on an east coast beach, one of whom was captured and 22 killed. The others were believed to be still at large in the south.</p>
<p>South Korea said they were on an infiltration mission while North Korea said the submarine ran aground after suffering engine trouble.</p>
<p>In its first statement since 1953 on the Korean armistice, the council urged &quot;that the Korean Armistice Agreement should be fully observed and that no action should be taken that might increase tension or undermine peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.&quot;</p>
<p>It also stressed that the armistice &quot;shall remain in force until it is replaced by a new peace mechanism.&quot; This contradicts North Korean assertions that the agreement is a dead letter and should be replaced by a peace agreement negotiated with the United States.</p>
<p>The council, in its four-paragraph statement, also &quot;encourages both sides of the Korean peninsula to settle their outstanding issues by peaceful means through dialogue, so that peace and security on the peninsula will be strengthened.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korean U.N. envoy Park Soo Gil told reporters this was the first time since the armistice halting the 1950-53 Korean war that the council had issued a resolution or statement concerning the Korean peninsula, although it had acted in connection with North Korea's nuclear potential.</p>
<p>He said the statement &quot;should serve as a clear warning by the international community against North Korea's policy of military provocation and confrontation.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for North Korea's U.N. mission repeated to reporters that the incident resulted from &quot;an accident caused by engine trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;South Korean authorities, from the beginning, branded our small submarine as an armed spy ship and, exaggerating the incident, schemed to make political capital of it,&quot; he said. He said the council had rejected attempts to produce a council resolution against North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea was &quot;aggravating the situation, killing our soldiers in cold blood, staging large-scale military exercises aimed at us, and introducing large quantities of offensive weapons which constitute a violation of the armistice agreement,&quot; he added, calling for the return of the submarine and crew, including the bodies, to the north.</p>
