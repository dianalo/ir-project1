<p>Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said on Friday that his centrist coalition government would cut the 1997 state budget deficit to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, from 1996's 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>The deficit figure for 1997 was agreed during loans talks with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Ciorbea told a meeting with leaders of his National Peasant party.  </p>
<p>Ciorbea said that the government would announce a tough programme next Monday, aimed at stepping up market reforms, with one-third of the 1997 budget going to social security.</p>
<p>The budget bill -- a plank of loan talks with the World Bank and IMF -- would be presented to parliament later this month, he said.</p>
<p>Both lenders had withheld loans to Romania last year over foreign exchange market curbs and overspending by the former ruling leftists in an election year.</p>
<p>The 1996 state budget gap was far in excess of the 2.2 percent target agreed with the Fund.</p>
<p>Ciorbea, whose centrist coalition ousted ex-communists in last November's elections, has pledged tight policies to contain surging deficits and inflation, to boost efforts to put the economy on a free-market footing.</p>
