<p>Tropical Storm Isidore swiftly gained strength in the mid-Atlantic on Wednesday and could become a hurricane within 24 hours, the National Hurricane Center said.</p>
<p>Isidore graduated to tropical storm status early on Wednesday, becoming the ninth tropical storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. By 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), its maximum sustained winds had risen to 65 mph (105 kph), nearing the threshold of 74 mph (120 kph) at which a tropical storm becomes a hurricane.</p>
<p>&quot;It really got its act together during the night,&quot; said Brian Jarvinen, a forecaster at the hurricane center. &quot;We may have a hurricane by tomorrow because this system is sitting right on a tongue of warm water and the upper level features are ripe for development.&quot;</p>
<p>At its current speed and position, Isidore would not approach the Caribbean for four to five days, he said.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. EDT, it was located at latitude 10.8 north and longitude 31.0 west, about 550 miles (885 km) west-southwest of Africa's Cape Verde islands. It was upgraded from a tropical depression to a tropical storm six hours earlier.</p>
<p>The storm was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (34 kph) but was expected to slow down, forecasters said.</p>
