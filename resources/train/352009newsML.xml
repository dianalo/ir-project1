<p>UK gas industry regulator Ofgas is to hold a review at the end of February to assess the performance of the Network Code, the rule book governing trade on the deregulated domestic market, an Ofgas spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The code's worked well during the winter and everyone's getting their gas,&quot; he said. But he added that Ofgas had decided the code should be reviewed after the first six months since the &quot;hard landing&quot;, when strict financial penalties for failing to observe all the provisions of the code, was introduced on September 1.</p>
<p>Ofgas could not say how long the review would take, although the spokesman added that it would be published on completion.</p>
<p>A total of 56 amendments to the code have already been added since it was introduced, with over 100 modifications proposed, but Ofgas was not surprised by this. &quot;The whole idea is to include things we hadn't originally thought of,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for TransCo, the pipeline arm of British Gas Plc, which operates the National Transmission System, said that TransCo was involved in a number of workshops discussing the implementation of full domestic competition in 1998. One of the subjects under discussion was whether the code needed simplification.</p>
<p>&quot;There are fears in the industry that the document is too complicated, although it is a complicated subject,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not our code, it's everybody's code, and if the industry wants it simplified we'll look at ways to help simplify it.&quot;</p>
