<p>Britain's former surgeon general defended the government's slow action in investigating Gulf War illness on Friday, saying it took a long time to find enough sufferers to justify a probe.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Beale, now chief medical adviser to the British Red Cross, said he had only learned of a legal campaign on the mysterious syndrome 18 months after the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Appeals for sufferers to come forward only turned up a handful at first.</p>
<p>&quot;In answering the criticism that these expensive studies should have been undertaken earlier, I have tried to show how difficult it has been to decide exactly when this decision could have been made,&quot; Beale wrote in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>Beale said one doctor was assigned to investigate but by June, 1994, he had seen only 30 sufferers -- a tiny percentage of the 40,000 servicemen and women Britain sent to help out in the war.</p>
<p>It was not until January of this year that 1,100 were registered, and more than 900 had been fully investigated.</p>
<p>Britain now has agreed to conduct full epidemiological studies into the syndrome.</p>
<p>U.S. and British veterans have been suing for recognition of Gulf War illness, which has symptoms ranging from rashes to chronic fatigue.</p>
<p>Lawyers for 1,000 British veterans say a cocktail of immunisations to protect them against chemical and biological warfare and to help them adjust to desert conditions is the likely cause.</p>
<p>Others say it could have been the use of organophosphate pesticides, which they say affect the nervous system.</p>
<p>Yet others blame chemical or biological weapons they say might have been used secretly by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's troops against the alliance that drove them out of Kuwait in 1991. In the United States some health workers claim they have caught the illness from veterans.</p>
<p>Earlier this month parliament's all-party Defence Committee criticised two defence ministers for persistently denying that British troops were subjected to dangerous chemicals as they prepared for the Gulf War.</p>
<p>Ministers at first said pesticides were used on only a very small scale to stop the spread of disease among British troops, but later said their use had been much more widespread than previously believed.</p>
<p>In the United States, President Bill Clinton established the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses in May, 1995. It published a final report in December last year.</p>
<p>Clinton has extended the eligibility period for compensating Gulf War veterans with undiagnosed illnesses to 2001, saying they should get paid even if science cannot pinpoint the causes of their illnesses.</p>
