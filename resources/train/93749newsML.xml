<p>Taiwan's Bank SinoPac said on Thursday that its US$85 million acquisition of California's Far East National Bank will give it a regional role on both sides of the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>&quot;We set the goal of becoming a trans-Pacific bank,&quot; president and chief executive officer Paul Lo told Reuters at a reception to announce the acquisition. &quot;This deal puts us in the direction of operating as a regional bank.&quot;</p>
<p>The purchase gives the aggressive Taiwanese bank an attractive foothold in California and even a slim toehold in communist China, whose five-decade rivalry with Taiwan has kept the Nationalist-ruled island's banks at bay.</p>
<p>Pending regulatory approval in the United States and Taiwan, SinoPac will acquire all of Far East National's equity, making it the first Taiwanese bank to acquire a U.S. bank.</p>
<p>Although Taiwanese investors have bought into U.S. banks, this was the first direct bank-to-bank investment.</p>
<p>From its 24-branch Taiwan base, SinoPac has excelled in consumer banking, not surprising as most of the senior executives learned their craft at Citibank.</p>
<p>SinoPac acquired the local loan protfolio of Wespac Bank in 1994 and listed its own shares on Taiwan's over-the-counter market in January.</p>
<p>For six months, the market has been abuzz with rumours that Sinopac was on the verge of acquiring a foreign bank.</p>
<p>Far East National, based in Los Angeles, has 10 branches in southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, employing about 200 people. Its after-tax net profit has averaged 15 percent over the past five years, SinoPac said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a profitable bank with a good image,&quot; Lo said.</p>
<p>Unlike many Chinatown banks serving the overseas Chinese community almost exclusively, Far East National has a wider franchise with non-Chinese comprising 30 percent of business.</p>
<p>SinoPac is eager to open a Silicon Valley branch of Far East National to link with its branch near Taiwan's high-tech showcase, the Hsinchu Science Park.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to serve as a bridge for capital flow between the two high-tech centers, assisting Taiwan companies in the U.S. and vice versa,&quot; Lo said.</p>
<p>Once acquired, Far East National will delist from the American Stock Exchange, but SinoPac may relist shares several years down the road, Lo said.</p>
<p>The fact that Far East National has a representative office in Beijing -- capital of Taiwan's communist rival, China -- was not a major consideration in the acquisition, Lo said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has barred direct contact with the Beijing government and China's financial bodies since the Nationalist government, vanquished by the communists in 1949, fled to Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not counting on the Beijing connection,&quot; Lo said, noting that the link could easily be severed if authorities in Taiwan or Beijing find it objectionable.</p>
<p>Jason Tuan, banking analyst at Peregrine Securities, Asia, called the acquisition a positive investment for SinoPac.</p>
<p>&quot;Far East National has a return on asset ratio of 1.05 and return on equity 11.60, compared to SinoPac's 0.76 and 6.86,&quot; Tuan said. &quot;Far East gives SinoPac greater potential.&quot;</p>
<p>As a new bank, SinoPac is leveraged only about nine times, far below the average leverage of 20 times for mature banks in Taiwan. The acquisition is unlikely to hurt its financial position, Tuan said.</p>
<p>Lo said SinoPac would consider issuing floating rate notes to pay for the acquisition. It has a BBB-plus credit rating.</p>
