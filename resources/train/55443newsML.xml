<p>Ukraine's Antonov airplane designer and manufacturer is to complete work on models of its latest An-70 and An-140 transport aircraft by the end of the year, a top company official was quoted as saying on Monday.</p>
<p>Anatoly Dubovenko, head of Antonov's technical and scientific department, told Ukrinform news agency's business weekly that both models were almost ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Once we receive some equipment we need, flights will be possible at the end of the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dubovenko said 10 million hryvnia ($5.7 million) were needed to buy radio-electronic equipment from Russia to complete the An-70.</p>
<p>Financing for the model, with a capacity of 35 tonnes, is provided by Antonov and a joint Ukrainian-Russian consortium.</p>
<p>Ukrainian authorities have banked on the export potential of the An-70, whose prototype was completed in 1994 but crashed on a test flight a year later outside Kiev.</p>
<p>Officials blamed the crash on an aircraft accompanying the An-70 during the flight.</p>
<p>Antonov will be able to produce 24 An-70s annually.</p>
<p>The 52-seat short-haul turbo-prop An-140 is to replace the ageing An-24, substantial numbers of which are still operating in the former Soviet Union and other countries. The plane will be able to carry 4.9 tonnes of cargo.</p>
<p>The financing of the An-140 has been from the state budget.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Ukraine won a tender from Iran to build a plant there, capable of producing ten An-140 planes yearly.</p>
