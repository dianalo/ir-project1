<p>Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote on Tuesday but suffered embarrassment when several of his own coalition members absented themselves from the vote, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The government defeated the motion by a 55-50 majority in the 120-member parliament with two abstentions.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm very happy that the no confidence fell. I predicted as much. I told you that the government would hold,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters after the vote.</p>
<p>Eleven members of Netanyahu's ruling coalition did not participate in the vote including Foreign Minster David Levy. Several coalition members had said they would absent themselves to protest Netanyahu's leadership.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday the prime minister's office said Netanyahu had put off naming a finance minister after his candidate, hardliner Ariel Sharon, also demanded a senior security post, complicating the appointment.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still problems which we will solve in the future including the appointment of ministers,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
