<p>Israeli political analysts questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judgment in playing power politics and angering a key immigrant party just days before a parliamentary no-confidence vote.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a foolish error in judgment,&quot; Gerald Steinberg of the Begin-Sadat Centre for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University said of Netanyahu's treatment of the Yisrael ba-Aliya party, which has the power to topple his government.</p>
<p>Mark Heller of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Centre for Strategic Studies said Netanyahu's forcing Likud arch-rival Dan Meridor to resign this week as finance minister pointed to personal ambition at the expense of all.</p>
<p>Yisrael ba-Aliya hinted this week it could quit the government in protest at Netanyahu's not honouring commitments in their coalition agreement and his delay in adopting proposals that Sharansky crafted with Meridor aimed at better government.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem is amatuerish management because of partly inexperience and partly an inordinate amount of personal ambition. There's no one in politics who is not ambitious...but there's reasonable and unreasonable,&quot; Heller said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he's still waging his campaign against all of the elites in Israel...There's something Nixonian about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Meridor, a second-generation leader in Netanyahu's ruling Likud party, said the 47-year-old prime minister orchestrated the row over currency reform to force him from office. Netanyahu denied it.</p>
<p>The government coalition, which took office one year ago, commands 66 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Yisrael ba-Aliya has seven seats, enough to decide a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Party head, Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, told Israel Television on Wednesday: &quot;We are already, in effect, with one foot outside. We are already not part of the coalition.&quot;</p>
<p>Party members have voted as they please for the last week in parliament.</p>
<p>Sharansky boycotted the cabinet meeting on Friday. At the meeting a compromise on one of the Sharansky-Meridor proposals was reached creating a committee to oversee senior appointments.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations continue and the crisis continues...it's (the committee) only one paragraph in the list of our demands,&quot; Sharansky told reporters at a news conference in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, also of Yisrael Ba-Aliya, earlier said the chances his party would support the government in the no-confidence vote were 50-50.</p>
<p>Analysts Steinberg and Heller said there was little chance Yisrael ba-Aliya would bring the government down next week but a process had been set in motion that would plague Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;This might be a crisis that will last longer than next week because Sharansky might not want to make these kind of radical decisions in such a short time,&quot; Steinberg told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sharansky is a political tyro who came to Israel from the Soviet Union in 1986 after being jailed for nine years as a Jewish dissident. In 1996, he led a party of Russian immigrants in national elections, winning enough votes to act as kingmaker.</p>
<p>Heller said he expected the disaffected group within the coalition would try to pass a law that would allow the impeachment of Netanyahu without dissolution of parliament.</p>
<p>Currently it takes 80 votes to impeach the prime minister. If a no-confidence motion passes with a simple 61-seat majority, new elections are held for both prime minister and parliament.</p>
<p>The group would include Sharansky's party, the four-member Third Way party, Meridor and Likud's Benny Begin who resigned earlier this year as science minister.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be easier for those who are disaffected from Netanyahu to vote for a change in the government 'basic law' than to vote themselves out of office,&quot; Heller said.</p>
