<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged security chief Alexander Lebed on Thursday to stay on in his post, the Kremlin press service said in a statement which suggested the retired general had threatened to quit.</p>
<p>The press service said Lebed was unhappy over the appointment of his predecessor as national security adviser to head a committee on senior military appointments and added: &quot;The president stated that A.I. Lebed does not have enough grounds to raise the issue of leaving his post over this.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The president urged A.I. Lebed to continue carrying out his duties and to make more effort to work with the government,&quot; the statement added. It was issued after Lebed's first meeting with Yeltsin in two months.</p>
<p>Earlier, a spokesman for Lebed told Ekho Moskvy radio there was no truth in a rumour that the security chief had threatened to resign following a hostile reception in parliament on Wednesday when he presented his Chechen peace accord.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, in a radio address on Thursday morning, pointedly praised Lebed for ending the bloodshed in Chechnya but added that there was still work to be done on the peace settlement.</p>
<p>Lebed and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were due to meet Chechen separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Moscow on Thursday afternoon. Yeltsin told Lebed: &quot;We must conduct the negotiations with Yandarbiyev subtly and wisely.&quot;</p>
