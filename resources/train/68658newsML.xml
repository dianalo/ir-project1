<p>An influential Irish-American politician dampened hopes on Saturday of an early IRA ceasefire after nearly three hours of talks with the guerrillas' Sinn Fein political arm.</p>
<p>&quot;No, there is no news of that sort that we have,&quot; former U.S. Congressman Bruce Morrison told reporters asking him about the potential for a new truce by Irish Republican Army (IRA) fighters opposed to British rule in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>British and Irish media, quoting security sources in both countries, reported last week that the IRA was considering convening a secret peace conference of its underground commanders. Sinn Fein said the reports were groundless.</p>
<p>Morrison helped broker a 17-month IRA ceasefire that began in September 1994, but Sinn Fein and sources in his delegation denied the visit was linked to the reports.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein's chief strategist Martin McGuinness said earlier that struggling Anglo-Irish-sponsored talks which exclude his party had failed and should be scrapped.</p>
<p>&quot;These talks are pointless, they are going nowhere,&quot; he told BBC radio. &quot;I believe they should be wound up,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a need now to reconstruct a new peace process, this time with completely different terms of reference.&quot;</p>
<p>McGuinness said Sinn Fein had to be included in future peace talks and demands for prior IRA disarmament must be dropped.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time that people stopped fooling the public (and) recognised that the peace process is dead and that the urgent task now facing us is to establish whether or not we can reconstruct, rebuild a new peace process,&quot; McGuinness added.</p>
<p>Without Sinn Fein's inclusion in talks and other &quot;confidence-building&quot; measures, there was no prospect of a ceasefire, McGuinness said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the minimum I believe that Sinn Fein (would need) to go to the IRA to request a second ceasefire. I think that anything less than that is doomed to failure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Northern Irish peace process, which flourished when the IRA and pro-British Loyalist foes called twin truces, flagged in February when the IRA resumed violence, accusing Britain of violating a deal giving Sinn Fein a seat at talks.</p>
<p>Britain, backed by Ireland, convened talks involving all the province's major pro-British Protestant and pro-Irish Catholic politicians in June but said there would be no seat for Sinn Fein until the IRA called off its renewed bombing campaign.</p>
<p>The talks, chaired by former U.S. senator George Mitchell, have been blighted by procedural wrangling and have failed to tackle substantive issues or make headway towards a settlement.</p>
<p>Morrison is due to meet British Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew, Irish Prime Minister John Bruton and a range of Protestant and Catholic politicians on his five-day visit.</p>
<p>The former Congressman said he and his colleagues would brief White House officials and others in the United States about their meetings. He said he had heard nothing in his talks with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams that would contribute to feelings of despair.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is a commitment on the part of the Sinn Fein leadership, that has been expressed to us over a long period of time, that wants to build a successful political peace process.&quot; he said.</p>
