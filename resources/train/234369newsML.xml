<p>The Florida governor's appointment of an oversight board will give Miami the technical help needed to mend its bleeding budget, but it still falls to elected city officials to enact politically painfull repairs, those involved said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The tough part is really in the political arena,&quot; attorney Tom Tew, a finance and securities expert acting as special counsel to the city, said. &quot;It still remains the city's responsibility to provide its own solution.&quot;</p>
<p>Miami, which has a $68 million deficit in its $275 million for the year that began October 1, has for years spent more money than it raised, issued bonds to pay operating expenses, shuffled money among accounts and made only feeble efforts to collect overdue fees and rents.</p>
<p>Aides said Gov. Lawton Chiles refused a cash infusion to bail out the city because Miami has &quot;a structural budget deficit&quot; and a loan would only postpone the inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;The future is raising revenues and cutting costs,&quot; Tom Gabriel, vice president of the Miami firefighters union said.</p>
<p>The firefighters are among three city employee unions that have agreed to accept wage concessions if the city agrees to raise revenues by $14 million. About $10 million of that would be raised by doubling garbage fees, which at $160 yearly, are less than half what surrounding communities pay.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not hung up on the garbage fees. But it's going to be hard to come up with $14 million in revenues without it, especially when it's so ripe for the picking,&quot; Gabriel said.</p>
<p>City commissioners will vote December 12 on the revenue-raising proposal. The vote was originally scheduled last month but was delayed because it had litle support among city commissioners, part-time workers paid $6,000 annually.</p>
<p>So far, only one of the five commissioners, Willy Gort, has publicly said he will back the proposal, adding the he feels it is &quot;the right thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anywhere else it would be taken for granted. In Miami that's pretty impressive,&quot; Gabriel said.</p>
<p>Miami lost its last city manager and finance director when they resigned in the fall to face federal corruption charges, and one city commissioner is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to bribery charges.</p>
<p>The scandal has raised more questions about whether Miami has the political wherewithall to save itself.</p>
<p>&quot;This is still a very young town. And it's a lot of frontier politics are played. We don't necessarily have in political office the best and the brightest,&quot; Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and Labor Program at the North-South Center at University of Miami, said.</p>
<p>Questions also remain about exactly how much money the city gets and spends. Interim City Manager Merrett Steirheim estimated the deficit at $68 million. Newly appointed City Manager Ed Marquez was holed up Wednesday with the state budget experts Chiles sent, poring over records best described as chaotic.</p>
<p>The governor said he would appoint a five-member oversight board by the end of next week to help untangle the mess and report back to him.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a woeful lack of financially solid information,&quot; Tew said. &quot;The most important part (of the governor's aid) is the technical assistance we need in the budget and finance arena to ascertain short and medium cash flow needs.&quot;</p>
<p>Members of the oversight will serve as advisors, with no authority over the city commission. But their presence could strengthen political resolve, because Chiles has pledged to take more drastic steps if needed, Gabriel said.</p>
<p>&quot;The governor makes the final decision. It's 'advisory' as long as they come up with a good plan,&quot; Gabriel said.</p>
<p>Even then, Tew said, it will take as long as six months to solve the immediate cash flow problems.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you have the long-range problem of restoring the reserves so we have a healthy city. It could take three to five years,&quot; he said.</p>
