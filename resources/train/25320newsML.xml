<p>Australia-based transport equipment hire and logistics firm, Brambles Industries Ltd, reported a 15.8 percent profit lift for the 1995/96 year on Friday despite flat Australian and European economies.</p>
<p>Surging profits from Brambles' U.S. and European CHEP pallet hire joint venture with Britain's GKN Plc compensated for otherwise slow growth from Australia, the company said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The continuing improvement in our performance reflects, in part, the successful retionalisation of our wholly owned businesses and strong growth from our CHEP joint ventures,&quot; Brambles Chief Executive John Fletcher said.</p>
<p>&quot;CHEP USA, in particular, continues to justify our confidence in its long term growth prospects in the region,&quot; he said in Bramble's profit statements.</p>
<p>Brambles' net profit rose to A$215.1 million (US$169.9 million) for the year to June 30, 1997 from A$97.7 million in 1994/95, but the previous year's result was undermined by a large abnormal loss.  </p>
<p>Pre-abnormal profits for 1995/96 rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the top end of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profits rose 13 percent and 30 percent from Europe and the United States respectively, while Australian profits rose eight percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Overseas profits grew at twice the rate in Australia and the trend is likely to continue,&quot; Fletcher said.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular we expect further contributions from CHEP in Europe and North America,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Fletcher later told Reuters this strong peformance from Bramble's non-Australian operations had encouraged it to actively look at further acquisitions outside Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here,&quot; he said, referring to areas like transport equipment rentals and records managements.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, he said strong contributions from the United States and Europe should continue to offset soft Australian conditions and help produce profit growth.  </p>
<p>&quot;We haven't got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy ... for at least another six months,&quot; he said. &quot;But all in all we've got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The result generally pleased analysts, who also pointed to the strong U.S. pallet operations as the main bullish note.</p>
<p>&quot;CHEP USA is the outstanding area,&quot; said Macquarie Equities analyst Ian Myles.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as they're saying positive things about CHEP in the USA then they'll be alright and there's a reasonable amount of momentum there,&quot; another Sydney transport analyst said.  </p>
<p>Brambles' shares closed up five cents at A$18.90 against a soft market overall.</p>
