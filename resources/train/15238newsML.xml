<p>Bauxite miner and aluminium and alumina producer Comalco Ltd faces profit downgrades for calendar 1996 after reporting a disappointing first half result, Australian aluminium industry analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Comalco, 67 percent owned by CRA Ltd/RTZ Corp Plc, earlier reported a net profit before abnormals of A$43.9 million on a joint venture basis for the six months to June 30, 1996, down from A$155.1 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The half year result was below analysts forecasts of between A$55 million and A$67 million. Comalco also declared a three cent dividend, which was well below expectations.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is a lot lower than what people were expecting,&quot; Macquarie Equities metals analyst Peter O'Connor told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast prior to the release of the first half result that Comalco would produce a net profit before abnormals of around A$130 million for the 1996 year, which would be well down on the A$232.3 million reported in the 1995 year.</p>
<p>&quot;You would have to expect that numbers would be coming down to at least double of what the first half was,&quot; O'Connor said.</p>
<p>O'Connor said this would make the result about A$90 million.</p>
<p>At the start of 1996, analysts forecast Comalco to report a net profit of between A$255 million and A$265 million for 1996.  </p>
<p>Analysts have trimmed back Comalco's profits this year, due to a weaker aluminium price and a stronger Australian dollar.</p>
<p>The three-month aluminium contract traded on the London Metal Exchange has fallen nearly 13 percent to its current level of US$1,479.0 from the start of the year while the Australian dollar has risen seven percent to around US$0.7900.</p>
<p>Analysts said that if the aluminiun price stayed at current levels it would eqaute to a net profit of about A$25 million for the Melbourne-based group in the second half.</p>
<p>Umit Safak, metals analyst at James Capel, said he would be lowering his forecast from the current A$130 million estimate.</p>
