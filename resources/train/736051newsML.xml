<title>USA: Cosby trial delayed due to lawyer's death.</title>
<headline>Cosby trial delayed due to lawyer's death.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The extortion trial of a woman claiming to be actor Bill Cosby's illegitimate daughter recessed on Thursday due to the death of prominent lawyer Arthur Liman, the father of one of the prosecutors.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors are expected to rest the government's side of the widely-watched case on Monday when the trial resumes.</p>
<p>Arthur Liman, who served as chief counsel to the Senate Iran-Contra Committee, was also a federal prosecutor between 1961 and 1963 and represented many high-profile clients.</p>
<p>Liman's son Lewis was questioning the government's last witness in the extortion trial when he was informed of his father's death during the lunch break.</p>
<p>The government alleges that Autumn Jackson, 22, tried to extort $40 million from Cosby by threatening to sell her story to a supermarket tabloid. Two alleged accomplices, Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, 42, are also on trial.</p>
<p>The three are charged with conspiracy, extortion and engaging in interstate commerce to commit crimes. If convicted, they face possible maximum prison terms of 12 years and fines of $750,000.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones has ruled that Cosby's paternity is irrelevant to the case and that the real issue is whether the defendants committed extortion. Cosby testified on Tuesday that he had sex once with Jackson's mother but denies being her father.</p>
<p>Jackson's lawyer Robert Baum is trying to persuade the jury that his client believed Cosby to be her real father and and she was trying to negotiate a settlement of her rights as a daughter.</p>
