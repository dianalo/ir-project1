<p>Nippon Life Insurance Co is planning to diversify its foreign bond investments by investing in U.S. corporate bonds starting in the next fiscal year from April, a company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The company aims to invest several billion yen in those bonds during fiscal 1997/98, but the official declined to give exact details on the volume or the names of the bonds.</p>
<p>The company plans to buy U.S. corporate bonds in an attempt to acquire higher returns as domestic interest rates are expected to crawl at record low levels, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeking instruments with a return of at least four percent per year, but it&quot;s impossible to achieve that goal by investing in domestic interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The official also said U.S. corporate bonds were reliable, with higher liquidity than other markets.</p>
<p>Nippon Life is currently concentrating on foreign government bonds in its offshore bond investments, but had avoided foreign corporate bonds in the past.</p>
<p>In November, Nippon Life said that it planned more than 100 billion yen worth of new foreign bond investments in the second half of the current fiscal year.</p>
