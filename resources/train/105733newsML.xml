<headline>Bangladesh President Shahabuddin Ahmed sworn in.</headline>
<dateline>DHAKA 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bangladesh's new President Shahabuddin Ahmed took office on Wednesday after being sworn in at the presidential palace.</p>
<p>He replaced Abdur Rahman Biswas, who completed his five-year term as president on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ahmed, a retired chief justice, was chosen for the largely ceremonial post in July by the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who took over from Begum Khaleda Zia in June following an election held under a caretaker administration.</p>
<p>Ahmed earned worldwide admiration by holding the country's first free and fair election in 1991, in which Khaleda was elected the country's first woman prime minister.</p>
<p>Ahmed was then the country's acting president following the resignation of president Hossain Mohammad Ershad in a stormy opposition-led campaign.</p>
<p>Born on February 1, 1930, at remote Pemoi village in the northern district of Netrokona, Ahmed graduated with an economics degree from Dhaka University in 1951. The following year he obtained his Masters degree in international relations.</p>
<p>Ahmed joined Pakistan's civil service in 1954, but switched to the judiciary in 1960. He was appointed a High Court judge on January 20, 1972, two months after former East Pakistan emerged as independent Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Ahmed, a father of four, was appointed chief justice of Bangladesh in January 1990, and in December became the country's acting president.</p>
<p>Ahmed returned to the Supreme Court after Biswas took over on October 8, 1991. He retired from the legal profession in January, 1995.</p>
