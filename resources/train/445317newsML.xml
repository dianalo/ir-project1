<p>At least three people were wounded by gunshots during an exchange of fire at Bangladesh's Dhaka University on Saturday between rival student political activists, police said.</p>
<p>They blamed the clash on factions of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD), student wing of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Arif Hossain, a JCD leader, was killed in a gunbattle with rivals at the university on Thursday. University officials said Saturday's shooting could be a sequel to earlier fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;Three people, believed to be students, have been brought to the emergency unit here with bullet wounds,&quot; one doctor at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said.</p>
<p>The Dhaka University has been the scene of frequent political violence that has claimed the lives of at least 20 students in the past decade, police said.</p>
