<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., has moved closer to sinking its teeth deeper into India's vast Hindi and regional language television audience, analysts said over the weekend.</p>
<p>The government announced on Friday approval for an $11 million direct foreign investment for News Television India Private Ltd. (NTVI), a News Corp affiliate.</p>
<p>While this represents little in money terms, clearance for NTVI effectively to operate as an Indian company will send shudders through domestic broadcasters, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Murdoch) is trying to push aggressively into the market through this move,&quot; Ashish Bhatnagar, media analyst for Bombay brokerage SS Kantilal Ishwarlal Securities (SSKI), told Reuters.</p>
<p>India's television industry currently is dominated by state-owned Doordarshan, with access to more than 70 million homes in a nation with an estimated population of 930 million people.</p>
<p>Independent industry consultant Iqbal Malhotra described Friday's news as a victory for Murdoch that would probably annoy domestic operators.</p>
<p>&quot;It gives NTVI carte blanche to operate in India,&quot; Malhotra said, adding that NTVI's next step could be to apply to become an Indian broadcaster.</p>
<p>News Corp.'s Hong Kong-based subsidiary, Star TV, owns 40 percent of NTVI. The rest is owned by a Mauritius-based offshore company International Graphics Holdings, which has the advantage of being headed by a non-resident Indian.</p>
<p>NTVI is a production house and an advertising sales agent effectively managing Star's interests in India.</p>
<p>If NTVI applies to become a broadcaster, and if the law changes to allow links to satellites from Indian soil -- currently prohibited -- Star will be better placed than any rivals to beam in on the direct-to-home market across India.</p>
<p>A senior Star offical in Bombay refused to comment on the new status of NTVI.</p>
<p>Industry sources say domestic broadcasters are concerned over foreign entry into the market in an apparent attempt to protect their advertising revenues.</p>
<p>They said Star might consider satellite links to broadcast live news and sports out of India if the laws changed.</p>
