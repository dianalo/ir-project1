<p>The International Monetary Fund may release the next tranche of its $10 billion three-year loan to Russia by the end of this month, Interfax news agency quoted IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>Camdessus, visiting Russia to talk to officials, was due to meet President Boris Yeltsin at noon (0800 GMT) after talking to parliamentary deputies. The IMF has delayed some tranches of the loan due to concern over low tax revenues.  </p>
<p>&quot;The regular tranche (around $340 million) could be given to Russia by the end of this month,&quot; Interfax said in a report on Camdessus' meeting with the budget committee of the State Duma lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>The agency said Camdessus hoped parliament would adopt Russia's new tax code by the end of this month and that he had reminded deputies that approval of the tax code was one condition for continuing IMF payments on the three-year loan.</p>
<p>It was important for Russia to reform its tax system, improve tax collection and tighten controls on budget spending, the agency quoted Camdessus as saying. --Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520</p>
