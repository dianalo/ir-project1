<p>Forth Ports Plc today said it is likely to push ahead with plans to build a ferry terminal near Liverpool despite being rejected grant aid by the European Union.</p>
<p>Forth Ports chief executive Alistair Fleming told Reuters: &quot;Our application for 4 million sterling aid to construct a terminal on the River Mersey at Birkenhead was based on throughput predictions by our principals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They have now guaranteed higher levels of throughput so revenues will be higher than we expected and the terminal makes even more economic sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Fleming added that the grant application was turned down by the European Union because aid was judged likely to distort competition.</p>
<p>The company had earlier said in a statement it was reviewing its position through discussions with potential partners following the rejection of grant aid for the terminal.</p>
<p>Forth Ports submitted a Harbour Empowerment Order for the terminal to the Department of Transport last year.</p>
<p>The company said three objections were received, and the DoT decided to hold a public inquiry this May into its proposals. Forth Ports added it had responded to the objections.</p>
<p>Fleming said the main opposition had come from Mersey Docks and Harbour Co which has rival plans for a terminal on the other side of the River Mersey.</p>
<p>He added that he believed there was sufficient long term potential for two terminals on the Mersey as traffic was growing rapidly across the Irish Sea. -- Paul Berrill Reuters Shipping News + Tel 171 542 4087</p>
