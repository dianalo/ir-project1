<headline>NYS official blasts cash bonus for Disney exec.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-24</dateline>

<p>The New York State Comptroller, criticizing a large severance package that Walt Disney Co is paying its former president, said Monday he would vote against a cash bonus for the current chairman.</p>
<p>H. Carl McCall, New York State comptroller, is the trustee of the state's Common Retirement Fund, which holds 3.4 million of shares of the Walt Disney Co.  </p>
<p>McCall, who also said he was concerned about the company's governance, based his objections in part on Disney's decision to pay such a big severance package to its former president, Michael Ovitz.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know how the Board can justify paying over $100 million to someone who worked for the company only 14 months,&quot; McCall said, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>While saluting the company's performance, McCall continued, &quot;It's hard to understand why a Board that has directed a company that has performed so well could do something so stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the board failed to demonstrate enough independence, saying &quot;Disney needs board members who do not have personal or professional relationships with management.&quot;</p>
<p>The state fund will withhold its votes for the five nominees to the company's board at its annual meeeting on Tuesday, when it also is expected to take up a proposed cash bonus for Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
