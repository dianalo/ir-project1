<headline>FOCUS - DBV may raise dividend, merger backed.</headline>

<p>German insurance group DBV Holding AF said on Thursday it saw a chance to raise its dividend in the future after increasing its 1995 payout to 10 marks from 9.50 marks.</p>
<p>Chairman Manfred Broska told the annual shareholders' meeting the group's merger this year with Swiss insurer Winterthur's German business increased the possibility that it could increase its dividend.</p>
<p>Broska did not give a time frame.</p>
<p>In his speech to shareholders, who voted on the merger plan today, Broska repeated that the move ought to mean a significant boost for DBV's 1996 earnings after the group posted 1995 net profit of 75.6 million marks ($51.18 million).</p>
<p>Shareholders later approved the merger almost unanimously, with 99.95 percent of those attending the meeting voting in favour of the move.</p>
<p>Broska said Winterthur's German units were expected to turn a 1996 net profit of over 20 million marks, ample to cover the expected extra dividend payout of 7.2 million marks which the merger would demand on the basis of a 10-mark dividend.</p>
<p>DBV announced in July that it planned to join its capital structure with Winterthur's German business to reflect their gradual fusion since Winterthur bought a controlling interest in DBV from Germany's Commerzbank in 1994.</p>
<p>DBV is to buy a 99 percent stake in Winterthur's main German units, three Munich-based firms which are now controlled by the CW Holding company, in turn owned by Winterthur.</p>
<p>CW will receive DBV shares in return. DBV is raising its capital to 169.4 million marks from 133.3 million marks.</p>
<p>The merger is expected to raise DBV's premium income this year by 40 percent to 5.3 billion marks, Broska said.</p>
<p>Group premiums would rise to 5.7 billion marks counting Winterthur's two Hamburg based units, Transatlantische Versicherung and Telcon Versicherung, which are expected to be merged into DBV in due course.</p>
