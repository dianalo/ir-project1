<p>Recent scoops on how tobacco companies covered up the hazards of smoking and how money talks in the halls of Congress would have made George Seldes smile. He had these stories all to himself more than half a century ago -- and he paid a heavy price.</p>
<p>Heeding his father's advice to &quot;question everything&quot; and &quot;never compromise on great principles,&quot; Seldes enraged publishers, fellow journalists, government officials and businessmen by exposing ugly truths.</p>
<p>His newsletter, &quot;In Fact: An Antidote For Falsehood In The Daily Press,&quot; indicted the press for ignoring racism, robber-baron capitalism and labour abuses.</p>
<p>The price for all this was virtual obscurity for the second half of his life.</p>
<p>Seldes, who died in 1995 at age 104, became a prophet without honour in his profession, and his contribution to crusading journalism remains virtually unknown. His boldness frightened away potential publishers. Red-baiting Sen. Joseph McCarthy forced his newsletter to fold, and the New York Times banned reviews of any of Seldes' books until 1987.</p>
<p>This may change with filmmaker Rick Goldsmith's Oscar-nominated documentary, &quot;Tell The Truth And Run: George Seldes and the American Press.&quot; The feature-length film opens with a cartoon depicting Truth fleeing an angry mob -- fitting for someone who spent his entire career battling opponents to get at the truth.</p>
<p>At the end of the First World War, Seldes, who was part of Gen. John Pershing's press section, narrowly avoided court-martial for sneaking behind the Armistice line to interview retreating German soldiers. Pershing overlooked his violation only after Seldes agreed not to print an interview with German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenberg, but Seldes never got over his anger about it.</p>
<p>BOOTED OUT BY THE BEST DICTATORS</p>
<p>That incident was only the beginning for Seldes. Later, the Bolsheviks banned him from the Soviet Union, Mussolini deported him from Italy for criticising his government, and a total of 20 countries censored him.</p>
<p>After almost two decades of fighting editors, Seldes gave up working for others after the Chicago Tribune deliberately excluded the Mexican perspective in publishing his article on U.S. oil companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The newspaper game for me was something like the thrilling thing it is in fiction,&quot; Seldes once wrote. &quot;But from the first day to the last there was censorship, there was suppression of news, there was distortion and colouring of the news, there was always an attempt by someone to mislead the public.&quot;</p>
<p>So he turned instead to publishing &quot;In Fact&quot; for ten years before FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator McCarthy drove subscribers away. Seldes' scoops during that period included articles on &quot;How Money Talks in Congress&quot; and &quot;The Suppressed Story of Health Insurance.&quot; His groundbreaking stories linking smoking to cancer and warning of the dangers of teenage smoking could have come out of this morning's paper.</p>
<p>A small, modest man, he once spent an hour with a visiting journalist telling him about all the stories he had missed.</p>
<p>&quot;I once went to a party in Munich in the 1920s that was attended by Hitler, who wasn't that big a figure at the time. He looked so boring I never went over to talk to him,&quot; he said, before going on to recount other moments when he walked out the door just as history was marching in.</p>
<p>MORE THAN A BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>In the film, Goldsmith intertwines appearances by Seldes, then a sharp-minded 98-year-old, with historical details, readings of the muckraker's writings and interviews with his fans, shaping it into a larger story about the media's duty to serve and protect democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;My story is about George Seldes and his career but it's not at the same time. It's about the sins, the crimes, the hypocrisy of the press and the way they have in the past and still in the present censored or distorted the news and the issues important to the running of our democracy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the same way that Seldes' writings influenced the careers of I.F. Stone, who once called him &quot;the grandaddy of us investigative reporters,&quot; consumer activist Ralph Nader and noted media critic Ben Bagdikian, Goldsmith hopes his documentary will inspire future generations.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot to teach and a lot to learn, and to me that's the value of his work and this film. He has something to say to young people. His journalism was about nothing if not the abuse of power, whether it was about corporations, governments, dictators, generals, advertisers, rich individuals or tobacco companies.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite Seldes' efforts, enough abuse, corruption and injustice remains to satisfy all the activists and muckrakers of the world.</p>
