<headline>DnB says increasing stake in Fokus to get BNbank.</headline>

<p>Norway's Den norske Bank (DnB) said on Wednesday it had increased its shareholding in Fokus Bank to make it easier to take over mortgage lender Bolig og Naeringsbanken (BNbank).</p>
<p>Both DnB and Fokus are bidding for BNbank.</p>
<p>DnB, Norway's largest bank, said in a statement it had bought five million shares in Fokus corresponding to 7.6 percent of stock in Norway's fourth largest bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of the share purchase is to increase the chances of DnB being succesful with its takeover bid for BNbank's shareholders,&quot; DnB said to describe the tactical acquisition.</p>
<p>It said DnB's wholly-owned subsidiary insurance company Vital separately held 1.6 percent of Fokus shares.</p>
<p>The statement stressed that DnB did not plan to take over Fokus.</p>
<p>It criticised Fokus's proposal to merge with BNbank and noted that BNbank had not expressed any wish to enter into a fusion with Fokus.</p>
<p>BNbank on April 11 said DnB's takeover bid appeared to be good and said it was postponing possible merger talks with rival bidder Fokus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, at the insistence of Fokus, BNbank's board said it had called an extraordinary general assembly for April 30 to discuss the takeover offer by Fokus.</p>
<p>DnB has given BNbank shareholders until the end of April to accept its cash offer of 209 crowns per share, including a 1996 dividend of 10.50 crowns.</p>
<p>DnB's cash offer values BNbank at 2.04 billion crowns excluding dividend.</p>
<p>Fokus has a share exchange offer valuing BNbank at 2.06 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The situation of Fokus is complicated by a hostile takeover bid launched for it last week by Sparebankgruppen, a group of 16 savings banks. The board of Fokus on Monday recommended its shareholders turn down Sparebankgruppen's bid and did not rule out other bids may come soon.</p>
<p>Sparebankgruppen said it was bidding 73 crowns per share for Fokus, which it valued at 4.80 billion.</p>
