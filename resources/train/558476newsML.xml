<p>The key crude oil port of Pajaritos and six other Mexican ports along the Gulf of Mexico were closed on Saturday because of winds of about 40 mph (60 kph), the government news agency Notimex reported.</p>
<p>Citing a port captain in Veracruz state, Notimex said all ship traffic in the state was banned from sailing, listing the Coatzacoalcos port complex, which includes Pajaritos, as well as the Alvarado, Nautla, Tuxpan and Veracruz ports.</p>
<p>Another Notimex report citing a port captain in Tamaulipas state said the key grains port of Tampico and Mexquital also were closed to minor ship traffic because of winds.  </p>
<p>Regional port captain Marco Antonio Vinaza Martinez of Tamaulipas state told Notimex that a cold front from the north is expected to bring high winds to the Gulf of Mexico coast for most of the weekend.</p>
<p>In Veracruz Bay, 13 ships were being prevented from sailing by the merchant marine, two more were beached on the island of Sacrificios and 20 fishing boats were taking cover at a Mexican Navy base, Notimex said.</p>
<p>Veracruz officials said they would reopen shipping once winds drop below 18 mph (30 kph).</p>
