<p>Indian businessmen said on Sunday they welcomed news the much-praised 1997/98 budget could be passed at a special parliamentary session later this month, despite the fall of the pro-reform United Front government.</p>
<p>Technically, the 1997/98 (April-March) budget, handed down in February, is a piece of legislation held over from the defunct United Front government of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, which lost a confidence vote in parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>The budget must still be agreed by parliament. Its approval is widely seen as a test of politicians' commitment to continuing economic reforms, despite underlying philosophical differences, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The consensus on the budget is a positive signal and will help boost stock market sentiments,&quot; Subroto Ray, head of research at DBS Capital Trust Securities, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But the United Front's tax-slashing measures and steps to boost investment, welcomed by businessmen as spurring industry, have won favour with India's other political parties as well.</p>
<p>&quot;The readiness shown by different political parties to discuss the Finance Bill is a silver lining in the prevailing precipitative politics,&quot; said A.S. Kasliwal, chief of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>Wracked by internal dissent, neither the United Front nor its Congress foe are ready for polls. Each is paralysed by backroom wrangling.</p>
<p>Standing by is the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which has the most to gain from new polls.</p>
<p>None of the parties want to risk public anger by blocking the budget.</p>
<p>Business groups fear the uncertainty and imminent elections will jolt the economy and send negative signals to foreign investors, who have been wooed through market-friendly policies.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lack of comfort amongst business because of lack of stability in the governance of the country,&quot; said Shekhar Datta, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry.</p>
<p>Parliament Speaker P.A. Sangma met President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Saturday to plead for a special budget session. Sangma's spokesman said later that Sharma had agreed to help move the budget for consideration in parliament during April 21 to 23.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome the decision of all political parties to pass the budget at a special session of the Lok Sabha,&quot; said H.L. Somany, president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowd said before being defeated in the trust vote on Friday that parliament would seek approval of the budget on April 21.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's budget has been hailed by industry for its plans to cut corporate taxes, lower income tax and reduce import tariffs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Appropriation Bill and The Finance Bill will be placed for approval of parliament,&quot; said a finance ministry official, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The Appropriation Bill, already examined by a parliamentary panel, lists the demands for grants or the spending proposals of the various ministries. The Finance Bill gives effect to the tax and tariff proposals outlined in the 1997/98 budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The parties can move amendments if they wish to do so and then the bill can be voted (on),&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The government so far has been empowered by a vote-on-account, or a bill authorising spending for 1996/97 programmes, until mid-May.</p>
<p>If the Finance Bill is not passed by then, the old tax and tariff rates set by government in its 1996/97 budget will continue, the finance ministry official said.</p>
<p>Business leaders feared that the prospect of a fresh election and a new government will hit key policy decisions in infrastructure and delay domestic and foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will wait and watch before making any commitment,&quot; a chief dealer at a foreign securities firm said.</p>
