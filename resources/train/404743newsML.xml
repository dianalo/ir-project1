<p>French police investigating a bugging scandal have found files belonging to the former head of President Francois Mitterrand's anti-terrorist unit, police sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The sources said the files, which include classified defence documents, were found last week in the town of Plaisir outside Paris at a garage owned by Christian Prouteau.</p>
<p>The sources said the archives also included recordings linked to a probe into telephone tapping by Prouteau's unit and that some of them were seized in the presence of investigating magistrate Jean-Paul Valat.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is due to rule on March 4 on whether to stop the probe into alleged widespread illegal phone-tapping by the cell at the Elysee presidential palace.</p>
<p>Two former senior government officials, Prouteau and three members of the since disbanded cell are being investigated over accusations that it tapped the phones of dozens of politicians, lawyers, and journalists without the required judicial permission.</p>
<p>Among those being investigated are Mitterrand's former chief of staff Gilles Menage.</p>
<p>Louis Schweitzer, the chairman of carmaker Renault, who was at the time chief aide to then prime minister Laurent Fabius, and former labour minister Michel Delebarre, who was chief aide to then prime minister Pierre Mauroy, are also being probed.</p>
