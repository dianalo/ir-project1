<p>Development financial institutions in Asia and the Pacific are slowly weaning themselves away from their traditional role, as freer markets allow the private sector to compete on their turf, industry leaders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The dividing line between government development financial institutions and private financial institutions is disappearing,&quot; Khun Aswin Kongsiri, president of the Industrial Finance Corp of Thailand, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Development banks are shifting to commercial banking to stay financially viable in an increasingly competitive industry, with many shaking off their government owners by going private.</p>
<p>However, the challenge of sourcing cheap funds faces many as they veer away from government support while trying to keep their developmental thrust intact, Kongsiri said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is not an easy task since many of these banks have been brought up with government support. They are not used to compete with private banks,&quot; said Kongsiri who is also the chairman of the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP).</p>
<p>&quot;They have to find a balance to stand on their own feet and at the same time, understand the concept of development enough to know which projects they will finance,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Alfredo Antonio, chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines, said the new environment should not discourage development banks since it offered an opportunity to expand their network with private institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;They've used our resources, we've used their resources ... That is the wave of the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As long as development banks properly manage their lending portfolio mix, they can withstand the competition, Antonio added.</p>
<p>There are still certain projects, such as health care and education, which private banks would not dare to venture, thus providing development banks to explore financing opportunities, he further said.</p>
<p>Members of the ADFIAP are currently meeting in Manila.</p>
