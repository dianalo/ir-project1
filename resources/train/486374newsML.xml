<p>There are 89 days to go before the British colony reverts to China. These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>-- The ECONOMIC TIMES said that if Taiwan did not advocate independence and China was not in a rush to reunify the country, a balanced relationship could be established between China, Taiwan and the United States. Hong Kong would benefit from a peaceful relationship across the Taiwan Strait, it added.</p>
<p>-- The Beijing-backed TA KUNG PAO said the Preparatory Committee, which was in charge of setting up the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government, had consulted Hong Kong people widely over producing the Selection Committee, the first SAR Chief Executive and the provisional legislature. Now, it would again involve Hong Kong people in deciding how the first SAR legislative council should be produced.</p>
<p>-- The HONGKONG STANDARD said that despite criticsim by U.S. House of Representataives Speaker Newt Gingrich of China's human rights record, Beijing did not respond aggressively because it did not want to halt momentum towards Sino-U.S. reconciliation. That might indicate China had a better understanding of the U.S. political system, and was an encouraging sign that the bilateral relationship had matured, the paper said.</p>
