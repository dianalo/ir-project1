<p>Thai police on Thursday said they had arrested and charged six workers with setting fire to the Sanyo Universal Electricity Plc warehouse and office on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok earlier this week.</p>
<p>The workers were picked up after police viewed videotapes of the arson attack taken by Sanyo management and heard eyewitness accounts of the incident which occurred late on Tuesday, a police spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The suspects face a maximum death penalty or life imprisonment if found guilty on the arson charge.</p>
<p>They would also be charged with disturbing the peace, which carries a maximum seven-year jail term, he said.</p>
<p>The suspects had all denied the arson charges, but one admitted he broke windows at the office, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>No one was injured in the fire. Sanyo has said that its insurance company was still in the process of estimating the damage but that its assembly line was unaffected.</p>
<p>The six workers were part of a group of about 2,000 Sanyo employees who had protested at the company's premises on Tuesday against a management decision to pay reduced year-end bonuses.</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on Wednesday warned that the incident could scare away foreign investors.</p>
<p>Sanyo Universal is 30-percent owned by Sanyo Electric of Japan while Thai partners hold the remaining equity. It makes refrigerators and other consumer appliances and holds the largest share of the Thai refrigerator market.</p>
<p>Trading in Sanyo Universal shares was suspended by the Thai stock exchange on Wednesday at the company's request.</p>
