<title>JAPAN: U.S. Marines lose appeal in Okinawa rape case.</title>
<headline>U.S. Marines lose appeal in Okinawa rape case.</headline>

<p>Two U.S. Marines lost their appeals on Thursday against prison terms for raping a schoolgirl in Okinawa, a case that ignited renewed protests against the presence of U.S. military bases on the island.</p>
<p>Marine Private Rodrico Harp, 22, was sentenced to seven years and Marine Private Kendrick Ledet, 21, to six and a half years in March for the abduction and rape of the 12-year-old girl on September 4 last year.</p>
<p>Navy Seaman Marcus Gill, 23, who was sentenced to seven years, has not appealed and is serving his sentence in Okinawa.</p>
<p>Gill had pleaded guilty to both abduction and rape charges. Ledet and Harp pleaded guilty to abducting the girl but denied raping her.</p>
<p>Presiding judge Norikazu Iwaya at Naha branch of Fukuoka High Court said in rejecting the appeals that the crime was vicious and caused a great impact on the local community.</p>
<p>The rape became a lightning rod for criticism by residents against the lopsided concentration of U.S. military facilities in Okinawa.</p>
<p>In a referendum last Sunday, Okinawans voted overwhelmingly to call for a reduction in the heavy U.S. military presence on the island and the prefecture's governor, Masahide Ota, is pushing for closure of all the bases by 2015.</p>
<p>Following the referendum, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto promised in a meeting with Ota on Tuesday to implement a series of measures to develop Okinawa, Japan's poorest prefecture.</p>
<p>The island, some 1,000 km (625 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is home to three-quarters of the U.S. military facilities in Japan and hosts about half of the 47,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in the country, although it constitutes less than one percent of Japan's total land area.</p>
<p>Okinawans have long resented the noise, aircraft accidents and crime associated with the heavy U.S. presence.</p>
<p>Following the rape, Ota staged a strong protest against the central government by refusing to sign orders for renewal of land lease contracts for U.S. military facilities.</p>
<p>This week he won a promise from Hashimoto that Okinawa would get special funds in the national budget</p>
