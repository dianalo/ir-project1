<headline>FOCUS - Dollar strengthens on hopes of higher rates.</headline>

<p>The dollar, weak in early trade, gathered strength on Monday as dealers bet on a rise in interest rates ahead of Tuesday's meeting of U.S. central bank policy-makers.</p>
<p>In equities, which saw  record closes in many European bourses on Friday, most markets were closed because of the Pentecost holiday. London, one of the few to open, fell by 0.7, depressed by Wall Street's big drop on Friday, caused by interest rate worries.</p>
<p>Most of Monday's action was in currency markets where the dollar, recovered after stumbling briefly to 114.85 yen in Asian dealings because of a sharp jump in Japan's trade surplus.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency gained nearly a pfennig and clawed back early yen losses in what dealers described as speculative buying, probably from the other side of the Atlantic. Its effect was exaggerated as holidays in most of Europe subdued turnover.</p>
<p>The dollar had earlier taken fright at data which showed Japan's overall trade surplus ballooned 163.7 percent to 831.48 billion yen ($7.2 billion). But it later climbed 1.5 yen from its overnight lows and was at 1.7020 versus 1.6944 in late trade on Friday.</p>
<p>Many dealers focused attention on the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) on Tuesday which will set interest rates and thus dictate dollar sentiment in the short-term.</p>
<p>Economists are split over the likelihood of a raise in U.S. rates at the FOMC, but some see the odds improving.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets, up until the end of last week, were of the opinion that U.S rates weren't going to go up.....but the Dow's fall on Friday has made the market stop and think a little bit that its no longer a one-way bet,&quot; said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at NatWest markets.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a close call, one way or the other,&quot; said Stretch.</p>
<p>A rise in U.S. rates on Tuesday would boost the dollar against the mark and yen after its recent stumble against both currencies as dollar-denominated assets become attractive to investors.</p>
<p>Against the yen the slide has been most dramatic after it was toppled from 55-month highs of 127.46 yen earlier this month to lows of 114.65 on May 15.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do see that 25 basis-point rise we should see the dollar recover some of the ground that it has lost,&quot; said Stretch.</p>
<p>In equities too, investors were worried about the FOMC's meeting and London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index fell 0.7 percent in sympathy with Wall Street which tumbled nearly two percent on Friday because of interest rate jitters.</p>
<p>London hit its ninth closing high in the last 11 sessions, at 4,693.9 points, on Friday and traders said on Monday that a shortage of stock was helping to cap potential losses.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has done very well,&quot; said one trader. &quot;There is clearly no selling pressure although most of the rest of Europe is shut today and people are sitting on their hands ahead of the FOMC meeting tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Many investors were growing nervous that the record-breaking performance of bourses would be vulnerable to any increase in interest rates in the influential U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the bravado that the market was feeling on the possibility that (U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan wouldn't put up rates is evaporating,&quot; said one equity salesman. &quot;The market is now preparing itself for a quarter percent increase and anything different from that would really twitch us,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, British Airways fell 21-1/2p to 738-1/2p despite record annual profits of 640 million sterling, which beat most analysts expectations.</p>
<p>Dealers said the results were impressive but after a recent strong run for the share price investors had decided to cash in their spoils.</p>
<p>STOCK PRICES AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 was down 30.6 points at 4,663.3.</p>
<p>Paris and Frankfurt were closed.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.7033 marks and 116.35 yen compared with 1.6944 marks and 115.53 yen in late European trade on Friday.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $343.35 versus London's close of $344.75 on Friday. Silver was at $4.71, down one cent.</p>
