<headline>EMS/Mark near highs on most crosses, soft vs punt.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The mark firmed slightly on its European crosses in morning trade, helped by the dollar and the pound's slide on Monday from near-multi-year highs against the German currency.</p>
<p>But movements in the mark crosses were small as the market focused on how much further the dollar and sterling would fall.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a bit of mark buying, like against the lira and peseta, but it's on the back of the weakness in the dollar which doesn't seem to want to recover above 1.84 (marks),&quot; said one trader at a British brokerage. &quot;Also most people are more interested in sterling/mark and cable at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>The punt was the European currency moving most against the mark. After a sharp overnight slump, the punt rebounded in early trade in tandem with the UK pound as it stabilised today following Monday's slide.</p>
<p>The punt was at 2.6729/04 marks at 0920 GMT, off its morning low of 2.6618 but still below 2.6795/45 seen late Monday.</p>
<p>The market was unfazed by the latest high-level remark concerning the launch of European monetary union. Rolf Peffekoven, a member of Germany's Council of Economic Advisers known as the &quot;five wise men&quot;, said delaying EMU by two years would be preferable to launching a weak euro on time in 1999.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said Peffekoven's remark added little to the constant stream of comments about whether EMU should go ahead on time at the expense of loosening the entry criteria, or delay the launch until candidates made the grade.</p>
<p>As yet such comments have not yet changed the market's perception that EMU will be pushed through on time, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rhetoric about a possible delay has certainly been increasing, but at the end of the day it's a political decision,&quot; said Deborah Read, economic advisor at Bank America. &quot;From that viewpoint, there's probably enough political will at the very top end of the political spectrum to make EMU go forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Peffekoven's comment follows one by Saxony state premier Kurt Biedenkopf yesterday that there was no rush to start EMU and that he could imagine delaying the launch for five years.</p>
<p>Bonn rebuffed Biedenkopf's remark, saying the government believed the single currency must go forward as planned.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the convergence trades going on in the markets, they're certainly heading in the direction of EMU going ahead. And that's the market's view, even though many may feel that it's not the best thing,&quot; Bank America's Read said.</p>
<p>In the European bond markets, the yield spread between 10-year Spanish government bonds and bunds widened to 63 basis points after hitting a record 59 points on Monday.</p>
<p>There was little reaction to data showing a sharp drop in French consumer spending, which in June fell 2.9 percent against forecasts for a 0.4 percent decrease. Mark/French franc was at 3.3725/30 against Monday's 3.3710/15.</p>
<p>Mark/lira was at 974.80/10 against yesterday's 972.65/95, with the market shrugging off a report by Italy's Agi news agency quoting a Treasury official as saying the 1997 budget looked largely on course to meet its deficit-cutting targets.</p>
