<p>Relatives of two British nurses charged by Saudi Arabia with murdering an Australian colleague returned to Britain on Tuesday after paying two visits to the jailed women, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Under Islamic sharia law, the two could be beheaded in public if found guilty of premeditated murder by a panel of three judges. Defendants have the right of appeal to two other five-judge panels before a final verdict is passed.</p>
<p>The relatives of Lucille McLauchlan, 31, and Deborah Parry, 41, checked out of their Dammam hotel late on Monday and boarded a British Airways plane for the flight to London, they added.</p>
<p>McLauchlan's parents Stan and Ann and Parry's brother-in-law Jonathan Ashby and her uncle Terry Knight saw the women separately twice at the women's section of Dammam prison in eastern Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>They also met British embassy officials and lawyers for the women, who have been charged with the murder of Australian nurse Yvonne Gilford, 55. Gilford was found stabbed four times, battered with a hammer and smothered in her dormitory at the King Fahd military medical complex in nearby Dhahran on December 11.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to say that we visited them again today (Monday) and they both are well...They are very well treated,&quot; Ashby told reporters after the second visit.</p>
<p>He declined further comment but insisted both women were innocent. Other relatives refused to talk to reporters.</p>
<p>British consul Tim Lamb and lawyer Michael Dark said they were going to see the nurses again on Tuesday. &quot;I am off now to the prison to see the girls,&quot; Lamb said.</p>
<p>Dark said he did not know when the case would go to court.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand they are together with other prisoners, that's what they told me when I saw them last week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if there were any developments in the case, Dark said: &quot;As I said before, we are satisfied with the legal process in Saudi Arabia. We are confident they will be treated fairly.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier some of the relatives said both nurses appeared in good health on Sunday but were finding life difficult in prison.</p>
<p>Ashby said that on Sunday, Parry was dressed in a long black robe which women in the conservative kingdom must wear, but her head was not covered, as custom dictates. She was not handcuffed.</p>
<p>He said the relatives and the two nurses were still struggling to understand the Islamic sharia law applied in the kingdom. &quot;We don't fully understand the legal system here...The lawyers are explaining things to us.&quot;</p>
<p>In the event of guilty verdicts, Gilford's family could spare the lives of the two and ask for financial recompense known as blood money instead of the death sentence.</p>
<p>Gilford's family in Australia have ruled out a clemency appeal for the two.</p>
<p>Legal experts said that if found guilty of manslaughter the two would not be condemned to death.</p>
<p>Saudi police have said the two confessed to the murders and the confessions were filed with three judges.</p>
<p>But the law firm Salah al-Hejailan said last week after a visit to the two Britons that they withdrew their confessions and one of them retracted a statement that she had a lesbian relationship with the victim.</p>
