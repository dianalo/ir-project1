<p>U.S. military commanders stationed in Germany are developing plans to evacuate more than 1,600 Americans living in Albania, a U.S. European Command military spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy spokesman Bob Anderson said the planning was being done on a &quot;contingency basis&quot;. He said no decision has yet been made and no additional troops have been ordered into the Balkan region.</p>
<p>&quot;We are doing standard planning and developing contingency plans. But no troops are being moved around. It is a matter of looking at the situation and making appropriate plans,&quot; Anderson told Reuters.</p>
<p>Military officials said any mission by U.S. forces, which they said would likely be &quot;non-combative,&quot; to Albania would involve navy and marine forces currently in the Adriatic Sea as part of U.S. forces supporting the Bosnia peacekeeping mission.</p>
<p>Albania, the poorest of the Balkan countries, has been hit by an insurrection that started with protests by tens of thousands of people who lost their savings in high-risk investment funds that collapsed.</p>
<p>President Sali Berisha declared a state of emergency last weekend in response to spreading rioting and anarchy.</p>
<p>Italy and Greece, points of refuge for Albanians in any mass exodus, have both expressed alarm about the unrest rocking the former Stalinist Balkan state, Europe's poorest country.</p>
