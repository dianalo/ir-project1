<p>Dickson Concepts (International) Ltd said on Monday it was studying alternative formats for its bid for U.S. clothing retailer Barney's Inc but still viewed the value of its previous offer as reasonable.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to study the acquisition. We think our previous proposal is a reasonable and correct reflection of Barney's value,&quot; Dickson's chairman Dickson Poon told a news conference.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Hong Kong upmarket retailer would continue to study the possibility of revising the format of its previous bid so that &quot;perhaps as a total package we may be able to cater to the needs of the different creditors better,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Barney's is facing bankruptcy and creditors have invited interested buyers to submit their bids by early July and will evaluate the offers thereafter, Poon said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Barney's rejected a bid from Dickson Concepts offering Barney's owners US$240 million in cash and a minority interest in Barney's future non-U.S. store licensing income.</p>
<p>A bid from Saks Holdings Inc in April offered  to acquire Barney's stock and assets for about US$290 million, which Poon said exceeded Barney's full value.</p>
<p>Barney's said last week it would close four stores in New York, Dallas, Houston and Troy, Michigan. Poon said the decision would not affect Dickson's interest in the acquisition.</p>
