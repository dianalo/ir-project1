<p>Joe Germaine threw a four-yard touchdown pass to David Boston with 19 seconds left as fourth-ranked Ohio State defeated second-ranked Arizona State, 20-17 in the Rose Bowl and spoiled the Sun Devils' chances for a national championship on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Second-ranked Arizona State (11-1) fell one victory short of its first undefeated season since 1975. The loss set up a national championship game between top-ranked Florida State and third-ranked Florida on Thursday night in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Clutch quarterbacking by Germaine and a pair of interference penalties against Arizona State helped Ohio State win the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1974. It was the Buckeyes' first trip to Pasadena in 12 years and the Sun Devils' first in 10.</p>
<p>Arizona State quarterback Jake Plummer had slithered 11 yards for a touchdown with 1:40 remaining to put the Sun Devils in front before Germaine, who began the game on the bench behind Stanley Jackson, guided the Buckeyes on a 12-play, 65-yard drive.</p>
<p>Dimitrious Stanley, who caught a 72-yard touchdown pass from Germaine in the third quarter, caught three passes for 36 yards on the deciding march.</p>
<p>Sun Devils' cornerbacks Jason Simmons and Marcus Soward were called for interference penalties. The second penalty on freshman Boston gave Ohio State the ball at the Sun Devils' 4. Germaine then threw a short pass to Boston, who caught the ball near the goal line and danced into the end zone.</p>
<p>Germaine completed 9-of-17 passes for 131 yards, Stanley had five catches for 124 yards and Boston added four catches for 20 yards.</p>
<p>Ohio State, which saw its hopes of a national title crippled with a 13-9 loss to Michigan in November, finished 11-1 and could receive some consideration for the national title if Florida, which lost to unbeaten Florida State in November, wins on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Heavy rain began to fall just minutes before Plummer, a Heisman Trophy finalist nicknamed &quot;The Snake,&quot; lived up to his nickname when he eluded blitzing linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, sidestepped several tacklers and dove into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Sun Devils moved downfield after a 37-yard field goal try by Josh Jackson was blocked by Brent Burnstein, who also smothered an extra-point attempt on Ohio State's final score.</p>
<p>Plummer, 19-of-35 for 201 yards, converted a 28-yard pass to Lenzie Jackson on 4th-and-4 to the Sun Devils' 8, keeping the drive alive.</p>
<p>Pepe Pearson of the Buckeyes carried 13 times for 111 yards, including a 62-yard jaunt that preceeded the blocked field-goal attempt.</p>
<p>Germaine took over late in the first half for Stanley Jackson, who threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Boston in the first quarter. Jackson threw to the right corner of the end zone for Boston, who got his left foot down before being knocked out of bounds.</p>
<p>Germaine was ineffective in the loss to Michigan but redeemed himself with the 72-yard touchdown pass to Stanley with 8:23 left in the third quarter. Stanley caught a crossing pattern at midfield and raced past Simmons into the end zone.</p>
<p>The Sun Devils had taken a 10-7 lead 49 seconds earlier on a 37-yard field goal by Robert Nycz.</p>
<p>A controversial 25-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Ricky Boyer early in the second quarter tied the game 7-7 at halftime. Boyer raced around Buckeyes cornerback Antoine Winfield and reached out both hands to make a diving catch in the left corner of the end zone zone. Replays, however, appeared to indicate that the ball hit the ground as Boyer was making the catch.</p>
<p>The Sun Devils wasted an opportunity in the third quarter when they moved to the Buckeyes 27 with the help of a personal foul on the Ohio State bench. But the drive ended when Katzenmoyer intercepted a tipped pass.</p>
