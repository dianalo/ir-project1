<p>Ecuador's new government is mending its public finances thanks to a stable exchange rate, a rise in international reserves and lower interest rates, said Alvaro Noboa, president of the policy-setting Monetary Board.</p>
<p>&quot;In 23 days we achieved a stable dollar, (borrowing) interest rates lower than 55 percent and liquidity in the markets,&quot; Noboa, who took office with new President Abdala Bucaram August 10, told reporters Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Borrowing rates were at 62 percent before the change of government.  </p>
<p>Noboa said that under a drive to reactivate the economy and create jobs the new administration will soon launch a low-income housing project and an agricultural development plan.</p>
<p>Bucaram's government is currently drafting a new economic program, to be announced in the next few month, aimed at plugging a budget deficit equal to 4.0 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecuador was so cash-strapped (when we took office) that if someone asked a financial institution for credit he was denied it, not because he didn't have good credentials but because the banks had no money,&quot; said Noboa.</p>
<p>He said the exchange rate was stable thanks to an inflow of dollars, which he did not quantify.</p>
<p>Noboa said international reserves had recovered to a record of $1.5 billion after shrinking to $1.3 billion in the final months of the government of former President Sixto Duran Ballen.</p>
<p>He also said he would promote price ceilings and floors for certain food products as part of a plan designed to boost the farming sector.</p>
