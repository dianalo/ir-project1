<p>----------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar ended trading weaker on Friday at C$1.3974 (US$0.7156) from this morning's open of C$1.3930 (US$0.7178) in spite of intervention by the Bank of Canada, dealers said.</p>
<p>* They said the currency recovered partly from C$1.3985 (US$0.7150) this afternoon, its lowest level since April 3, 1995, but is expected to endure renewed pressure next week.  </p>
<p>Traders said the U.S. economic data increased market speculation that inflationary pressures persist in the U.S. economy and could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in May.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is vulnerable right now. It could easily hit C$1.4000 (71.42 U.S. cents) before it rebounds,&quot; said John Anania, an economist with Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar slid on the expectation that such a rise in the U.S. would increase the short-term interest rate spread between Canadian and the U.S. yields.  </p>
<p>A 25 basis-point rate hike by the Fed on March 25 widened the spread between U.S. and Canadian short-term rates to more than 200 points, pressuring the Canadian dollar and renewing calls for the Bank of Canada to follow suit.</p>
<p>Canada's dollar has shed almost four percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since January as investors moved to buy the higher yielding U.S. short-term securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Canada (the dollar) is going to get hurt in this environment of rising U.S. interest rates,&quot; said William Chin, vice-president of foreign exchange with ABN-AMRO Bank.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canadian dollar fell to 1.2308 marks from Thursday's close of 1.2328 marks and slipped to 90.18 yen from Thursday's 90.21 yen.</p>
