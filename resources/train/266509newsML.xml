<p>NOVA Corp unit NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd said on Thursday that Alberta's energy regulator gave it the green light to implement a five-year plan negotiated with shippers aimed at boosting the efficiency of its pipeline network.</p>
<p>The Cost-Efficency Incentive Settlement, filed with the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board in August, was already projected to result in 1996 costs that would be well below the company's approved revenue of C$1.15 billion, NGTL said.  </p>
<p>It said that, under the settlement, savings would be shared equally between the company and its shippers, reducing 1997 gas transport tolls and improving 1996 earnings.</p>
<p>NGTL said it also reached agreement with customers and interested parties on a performance measurement system to incentives to encourage higher use of the pipeline system and reduce the cost of new capital construction.</p>
<p>This amendment to the incentive deal was filed with the AEUB on Thursday and would be in place from 1997 to 2000, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our assessment of other pipelines indicate NGTL has an efficient, competitive pipeline system,&quot; NOVA vice-president Eric Shelton said in a statement. &quot;With this amendment, all NGT's costs will be tied to incentives. Both our customers and shareholders will benefit as we continue to reduce costs.&quot; ((-- Reuters Calgary Bureau (403) 531-1624))</p>
