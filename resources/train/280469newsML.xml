<p>SIMEX Euroyen futures finished mixed on Monday dominated by arbitrage opportunities, while Japanese government bond (JGB) futures eased on yen pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;There were lots of spreaders in Euroyen, selling the front and buying the back months,&quot; a European commission house trader said, noting the market was long and invited profit taking.</p>
<p>June Euroyen futures at 1115 GMT was at 99.40, unchanged from its previous IMM close. The September contract was at 99.25, a tad softer, but off earlier lows at 99.23.</p>
<p>Traders said profit taking was also being pursued on views Japan's interest rates would remain unchanged.  </p>
<p>JGB's drifted lower, also responding to the bearish yen and a probable slow economic recovery for Japan.</p>
<p>Some traders said they felt weakness in the Nikkei 225 would trigger an eventual flight-to-quality and a demand for bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;The JGB's have fallen with the stock market, but it will be the first to capture investment dollars when they flee into fixed income instruments,&quot; another commission house dealer said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's scaled back bond market operations last week, which led to fears the Ministry of Finance might curtail bond purchases, weighed less on sentiment. Traders said firms were likely to raise bond purchases due to poor stocks.  </p>
<p>March JGB futures settled at 124.11, down 37 ticks on a thin volume of 290 contracts</p>
<p>Dealers pegged near-term support and resistance for March JGBs at 124.00, noting that was critical support.</p>
<p>But with Japanese markets closed for a week-long holiday and many players absent, prices were seen unlikely to budge much.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures were quietly firm, helped by a stong U.S. currency and no surprises amid the plethora of U.S. economic data scheduled for release this week. March ended unchanged from its IMM close, at 94.47, and June at 94.34, slightly firmer.</p>
