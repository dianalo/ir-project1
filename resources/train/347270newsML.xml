<headline>Dollar retreats against yen as fears of G7 action mount.</headline>

<p>The dollar retreated against the yen Friday as fears mounted that the Group of Seven industrialised nations would take steps to slow the dollar's rapid rise against the Japanese currency at an upcoming summit meeting.</p>
<p>But the dollar posted modest gains against the German mark, pushing higher in the aftermath of a robust U.S. fourth quarter growth report.</p>
<p>Several foreign officials suggested Friday that the dollar's recent surge against the yen would be a key topic of conversation at a meeting in Berlin, scheduled to begin Feb. 8.</p>
<p>Their remarks led traders to take profits in the dollar, which has risen by over 4 percent against the yen since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;When you hear all these comments you begin to wonder whether the G7 is more concerned about the dollar's rise than people had thought,&quot; said Bob Lynch, senior currency analyst at MMS International.</p>
<p>&quot;While it's unlikely that the G7 comes out with any statement which would tend to encourage a reversal in exchange rates, the risk is that they could temper it, which makes traders nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar ended the day at 121.43 yen, down from 121.83 yen Thursday. Against the mark, the dollar edged higher to 1.6387 against 1.6363 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>On Friday, Guntram Palm, a council member of Germany's Bundesbank, said the dollar's recent rise against the yen would be a &quot;major topic&quot; at the meeting, overshadowing discussions on European Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p>His remarks were echoed by Bundesbank Vice President Johann Gaddum and Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, who both said dollar strength would be a focus at the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;You're seeing a very calculated and orchestrated attempt to slow the dollar's rise against the yen down,&quot; said Paul Park, a trader at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>Limiting the dollar's losses against the yen, and boosting it slightly against the mark Friday, was a Commerce Department report that showed that the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in two and a half years in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The report showed that the nation's gross domestic product grew at a surprisingly strong 4.7 percent annual rate in the quarter, more than double the 2.1 percent rate seen in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The strong growth figures also helped the dollar against the British pound, which has been plagued recently by diminishing hopes for an interest rate rise ahead of upcoming U.K. elections.</p>
<p>Sterling ended the session at $1.6020, down from $1.6140 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar ended higher at 1.4239 Swiss francs versus 1.4232 Thursday. The dollar ended little changed at Canadian $1.3472 against C$1.3471.</p>
