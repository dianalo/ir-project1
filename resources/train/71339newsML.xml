<p>French Labour and Social Affairs minister Jacques Barrot said on Monday there was no question of increasing the debt to be financed by welfare debt repayment fund CADES, despite higher than expected welfare deficits this year and next.</p>
<p>He said measures would be taken via state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations and the Treasury to meet the welfare systems immediate cash-flow needs.</p>
<p>The government would review the situation in Spring next year once it had final figures for the 1996 deficit.</p>
<p>Earlier the social security accounts commission forecast a welfare deficit of 51.6 billion francs in 1996 and 47.15 billion francs in 1997.</p>
<p>The government has said the 1997 deficit will be reduced to 29.7 billion francs through higher taxes, announced in the Budget last week, and spending curbs.</p>
<p>CADES was set up this year to finance welfare deficits run up to the end of 1996, but has only made provision for a deficit of 17 billion francs, the original 1996 deficit forecast by the government.</p>
<p>In its report the social security accounts commission warned of the overrun this year and forecast deficits next year would leave the welfare system facing a debt of 82 billion francs by the end of 1997 in the absence of new measures.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result a new internal heavy social security debt, which will create worrying financial charges, would add to the externalised CADES debt of some 250 billion francs,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Asked at a news conference whether CADES would be expected to finance the new debt, Barrot said the welfare debt repayment fund's obligations were limited by law.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of increasing the volume of debt it must finance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will review the situation in the Spring,&quot; he said. But he added that once the government had achieved its aim of wiping out the structural deficit of the welfare system, the welfare debt could then be reabsorbed over the course of years to come.</p>
