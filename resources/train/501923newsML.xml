<p>After a week of home defeats in the league and away defeats in Europe, Manchester United and Liverpool must both attempt to get their season back on the rails this weekend against Blackburn and Sunderland respectively.</p>
<p>United's 3-2 Old Trafford reverse against Derby last Saturday opened the door for Liverpool to go level at the top -- only for Roy Evans's team to hand back the initiative by gifting Coventry a 2-1 win at Anfield a day later.</p>
<p>United followed up with a 1-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their European Cup semifinal, still a result that gives them every chance of reaching the final of the continent's leading club competition for the first time since 1968.</p>
<p>Liverpool, however, produced one of their worst performances in years and were hammered 3-0 by Paris St. Germain in the first leg of their Cup Winners Cup semifinal.</p>
<p>English bookmakers are offering 50-1 against the four-times European champions overturning that deficit and going on to lift the only European trophy they have yet to win -- but there aren't many takers.</p>
<p>Liverpool coach Roy Evans described the match as &quot;an absolute disaster&quot; and added: &quot;It was a bad performance and there's going to be a bit of soul-searching. We're going to have to have a close look at ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Liverpool visit relegation-threatened Sunderland on Sunday and Evans must act quickly to lift his team for what is sure to be a tough test.</p>
<p>Currently top of the &quot;could-do-better&quot; list is goalkeeper David James, whose call-up to the England squad has coincided with a series of expensive howlers.</p>
<p>His failure to deal with high crosses handed Coventry victory last week and was instrumental in the first two PSG goals on Thursday.</p>
<p>Evans made a point of publicly backing him in midweek but the Anfield fans are not as patient.</p>
<p>Sunderland will certainly look to put him under pressure as they seek to climb away from the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Manchester United's European performance was far more satisfactory but the defensive frailty that allowed Derby to score three goals at Fortress Old Trafford last week will be worrying Alex Ferguson.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and in-form centre back David May will both miss Saturday's trip to Blackburn and there are doubts over Dennis Irwin, Ryan Giggs and Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.</p>
<p>United are still fuming over the Premier League's refusal to extend the season which leaves them with a run-in of four games in nine days.</p>
<p>They will not want to go into that period needing maximum points and will look for a win at Blackburn to sustain their current three-point cushion at the top.</p>
<p>Blackburn, still not sure of safety, have plenty to play for themselves and are boosted by the return of suspended midfielder Tim Sherwood.</p>
<p>As everything went wrong for the two Lancashire clubs this week, Arsenal sneaked into second place with a 3-0 win at Chelsea.</p>
<p>On Saturday Arsenal entertain a Leicester team who have an eye on next week's League Cup final replay and the Londoners could still crash the title party despite manager Arsene Wenger's protestations to the contrary.</p>
