<p>The prospect of a rise in U.S. interest rates could put a dampener on the bubbling British stock market next week, after the record-breaking gains of recent sessions, equity strategists said on Friday.</p>
<p>With stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic continuing to thrust to record highs, the direction of rates in the world's biggest economy is likely to be a key factor in determining whether further gains are on the cards.</p>
<p>Uncertainties over a looming budget from the new Labour government could also keep a lid on shares, according to market experts.</p>
<p>The budget could include significant changes in corporate taxes, possibly eroding tax breaks for pension funds in owning shares and thereby reducing the value of the market overall.</p>
<p>Yet pundits said there seemed little prospect of a major market sell-off anytime soon, even if the U.S. Federal Reserve moves to tighten credit.</p>
<p>&quot;The main item next week is going to be the Fed meeting on Tuesday,&quot; said Philip Isherwood, strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. &quot;And the budget will give a good excuse for the market to drift but not necessarily to dramatically weaken.&quot;</p>
<p>Most economists questioned in a Reuters poll earlier this month predicted a quarter-point rise in short-term U.S. rates to 5.75 percent, the second such increase of the year so far.</p>
<p>Yet market experts here said such an increase was unlikely to be enough to derail the UK market's recent run, that carried the benchmark FTSE 100 index to an unprecedented eight straight record closes in the eight sessions after the May 1 election.</p>
<p>Some even believe that no rise is on the cards -- which could be taken as a signal that the Fed is relaxed on inflation pressures in coming months, potentially giving a significant boost to markets on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not expecting any change before the end of the year,&quot; said Ian Scott, strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;The data seem to be giving a clear signal that inflation pressures remain very low and we are expecting growth to slow down later in the year...and if they don't move we could see something of a rally in the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Next week's key British economic pointers include government borrowing figures for April, likely to be studied for an indication of possible tax increases in the budget.</p>
<p>The week also includes retail sales for April and provisional growth in GDP for the first quarter of the year -- both of which could give a signal on future British rate moves after the recent quarter-point rise.</p>
<p>Major companies reporting include British Airways Plc, retailer Marks and Spencer Plc, insurer Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Group Plc and leading property group Land Securities Plc.</p>
<p>On Friday the FTSE 100 set an intraday record of 4,723.7, up 42.5 points and passing the peak of 4720.3 set on May 13.</p>
<p>At today's high, the FTSE was up 605 points or 14.7 percent since the end of 1996 -- making some cautious about whether such a pace can be sustained through the rest of the year.</p>
<p>BZW strategist Steve Wright said the brokerage had raised its year-end target for the FTSE 100 to 4,750, joining others who raised their targets in recent days, but suggesting BZW does not see much scope for further gains in 1997.</p>
<p>Wright said he expected a slowdown in economic growth that would ease inflation pressures but squeeze company profits, making gilts look relatively more attractive.</p>
<p>Major new issues this year, including Halifax Building Society and cigarette maker Gallaher, could also drain institutional cash out of the rest of the market, Wright said.</p>
<p>&quot;We still find it hard to believe equity market values can go much higher,&quot; Wright said.</p>
