<p>An environmental group on Tuesday called for major U.S. chemical manufacturers to screen their products for toxicity, saying consumers have no information about the potential health risks of more than 70 percent of the most widely used industrial chemicals.</p>
<p>Although everyone knows about the dangers of DDT and lead, the government and universities have no toxicity information on chemicals that are heavily used in everything from gasoline additives to zippers, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, the public still today cannot tell whether a majority of the highest-use chemicals in the United States pose a health hazard or not,&quot; EDF executive director Fred Krupp said in a letter to the chief executives of the top 100 U.S. chemical manufacturers.</p>
<p>Congress passed a law in 1976 which called for producers to take responsibility for testing the effect of chemicals on health and the environment, but the law did not require them to file data with the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Krupp's letter urged manufacturers to release the results of health-screen tests for chemicals with total production of more than 10 million pounds a year by March 1999 and chemicals with total production of more than 1 million pounds a year by January 2000.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency and Chemical Manufacturers Association said they had not yet reviewed the environmental group's recommendations, but both said the public needed more information.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly support the fact that the public should have the information they really need to evaluate the risks of chemicals,&quot; said Don Helin, director of product stewardship for the Chemical Manufacturers Association.</p>
<p>He said the group backed ongoing efforts by industrialized countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to share the work and costs of testing different chemicals, using criteria that EDF said all companies should use for their products.</p>
<p>EDF estimated the maximum cost to each company under its plan would range from $20,000 to $150,000 for each chemical, which the group said &quot;should be a very modest cost in comparison to revenues.&quot;</p>
<p>EPA's chemical control division director Charles Auer disputed the environmentalists' view that little progress had been made in testing chemicals, but agreed that more needed to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;As a general matter, industrial chemicals as a group are less of a problem than would be, say, pesticides or pharmaceuticals, where they're intended to have biological activity,&quot; he said.</p>
