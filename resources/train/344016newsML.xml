<title>USA: New jobless claims up in week, help-wanted ads steady.</title>
<headline>New jobless claims up in week, help-wanted ads steady.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The number of Americans claiming first-time jobless benefits rose last week, and the volume of help-wanted advertisements edged lower in December, according to key surveys released Thursday.</p>
<p>However, long-term trends in the indicators continued to reflect a healthy labour market.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said claims in the week ended Jan. 25 advanced to 351,000 from a revised 341,000 a week earlier. Wall Street economists had forecast initial jobless claims of 348,000 in the Jan. 25 week.</p>
<p>However, the more closely watched four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations in the data, fell to 344,750 from a revised 350,250.</p>
<p>Separately, the Conference Board said its U.S. help-wanted advertising index fell to 85.0 in December from a revised 87.0 in November.</p>
<p>Despite the slight drop, the private business group said the index has remained in a range of about 85 to 90 throughout 1995 and 1996, reflecting an average of 230,000 net new jobs per month during the two-year period.</p>
<p>&quot;The labour market remains very healthy. The economy was generating new jobs at a 2.0 percent annual rate at the end of 1996,&quot; said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.</p>
<p>&quot;Initial unemployment claims were slowly moderating. And, job advertising volume has remained steady. All this data suggests that labour demand is not diminishing.&quot;</p>
<p>In the last three months, the volume of help-wanted advertising in 51 major newspapers surveyed rose in five of the nine U.S. regions. The greatest gains were in the West North Central and Mountain regions, it said.</p>
<p>Job advertising volume fell most sharply in the Middle Atlantic region, followed by New England.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said total benefit rolls remained unchanged at about 2.45 million in the week ended Jan. 18, the latest period for which that data were available.</p>
<p>The department said 29 states reported decreases in claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended Jan. 18.</p>
<p>Among the largest were North Carolina, with 19,383; Tennessee, with 13,611; South Carolina, with 10,262; and Alabama, with 8,233.</p>
<p>North Carolina reported fewer layoffs in the construction, tobacco, textile, apparel, furniture, lumber, rubber and non-electrical machinery industries.</p>
<p>Tennessee had fewer layoffs in a variety of industries.</p>
<p>South Carolina reported fewer layoffs in the food industry, while Alabama had fewer layoffs in the textile, apparel, furniture and lumber industries.</p>
<p>Labour said no states reported increases in initial claims exceeding 1,000, unadjusted, in the Jan. 18 week.</p>
<p>Goldstein said the pace of job growth will not subside in the early months of 1997, and sustained job growth and some rise in hourly compensation will likely reinforce high consumer confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;Job and income growth, associated with a high level of household optimism, could translate to strong consumer spending through the first half of 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
