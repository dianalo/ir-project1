<headline>RTRS-ABB makes barley payment, closes malting pool.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-02-19</dateline>

<p>The Australian Barley Board (ABB) said it would make a top-up payment of A$15 a tonne for all 1996/97 season barley pools and that all malting barley pools had been closed.</p>
<p>The A$15 payment forms part of the latest payment in a gross pool estimate which remains at A$210 a tonne for malting barley, ABB said.</p>
<p>Good cash flow from strong sales of both malting and feed barley had enabled ABB to make the top-up payment, which would occur across all grades in late March, it said.  </p>
<p>ABB also said new pools would be opened immediately for all malting grades except malt three, Skiff and Chebec, which would be traded for cash.</p>
<p>ABB expected a gross number two pool return of A$190-A$210 a tonne, although sales from the number two pools would be into a softer market where estimated returns were uncertain, it said.</p>
<p>The international malting barley market was quiet, with prices having softened since the start of the selling programme, ABB chief executive officer Michael Iwaniw said.</p>
<p>Feed pools remain open.  </p>
<p>The Barley Board markets barley grown in the states of Victoria and South Australia.</p>
