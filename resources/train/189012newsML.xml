<p>A 39-year-old man alleged to have cut off his finger and mailed it to family members in order to fake his own kidnapping, was arrested on Thursday.</p>
<p>Toru Odajima, who described himself as a shoe designer, was arrested at a Tokyo hotel on suspicion of faking personal data and other charges, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Police tracked down Odajima after he left a fingerprint on a form at a hospital where he sought treatment for the finger he cut from his left hand, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Odajima left his house on September 25 with a man who he claimed was a police officer.</p>
<p>Nearly three weeks later, his wife received a telephone call demanding 50 million yen ($450,000) in ransom. The family received six more calls and eight letters all threatening that Odajima would be killed if the ransom was not paid.</p>
<p>The seventh letter was in a package containing Odajima's left ring finger.</p>
