<p>A smiling Mother Teresa walked out of hospital on Thursday, three weeks after her third heart operation in five years, and returned to her religious order where nuns sang and danced.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old Roman Catholic nun walked unaided out of Calcutta's B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre.</p>
<p>Smiling with her hands clasped together in the traditional Indian greeting, she bowed to the crowd waiting outside the hospital and climbed into a car.</p>
<p>Sisters rang the chapel bell as Mother Teresa was carried up two steps into her Missionaries of Charity order. Nuns crowded around her, applauding, singing and dancing.</p>
<p>&quot;It is God's wish,&quot; Sister Priscilla Lewis told Reuters.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa was taken to the order's prayer hall, then to her room, which was equipped with oxygen in case of emergency, doctors said.</p>
<p>&quot;God has listened to my prayer and she is back home,&quot; said Alaka Ghosh, who stays at the order's Shanti Dan (Give Peace) home for the deranged.</p>
<p>The missionary, fitted with a heart pacemaker in 1989, was taken to hospital on November 22 after suffering heart failure. It was the third time since August that she had been admitted to hospital for emergency care.</p>
<p>Doctors operated on her on November 29, unblocking two coronary arteries with a tiny balloon. The surgery, during which she was under general anaesthesia, was successful.</p>
<p>Twice in the past week doctors have given her a mild electric shock to correct her heartbeat. On Wednesday doctors said nagging bronchitis had finally cleared up.</p>
<p>Doctors expressed admiration for Mother Teresa's recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;At least on four occasions she was almost dead but she pulled herself up,&quot; said Dr Patricia Aubanel, a U.S. specialist.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not easy at 86, particularly when you have got heart, kidney and lung problems,&quot; Dr Tarun Praharaj said. &quot;But she gets strength from inside.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr D.P. Shetty said the 1979 Nobel peace prize winner was in a fiesty mood before leaving hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;'Do you know how strong I am?'&quot; he quoted Mother Teresa as saying. &quot;She challenged me in a boxing bout and threw her fist in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;She is very happy that she could return home before Christmas.&quot;</p>
