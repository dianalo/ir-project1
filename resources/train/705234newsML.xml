<title>USA: Justice Department to turn over ADM tapes.</title>
<headline>Justice Department to turn over ADM tapes.</headline>
<dateline>PEORIA, Ill. 1997-07-03</dateline>

<p>The U.S. Justice Department said it will turn over government surveillance tapes to companies suing Archer Daniels Midland Co and other grain processors at 1600 CDT Thursday in Chicago.</p>
<p>The tapes were made during the government price-fixing investigation of ADM.</p>
<p>The Justice Department had fought the release of the tapes, contending they could jeopardize continuing criminal investigations. But earlier this week the 7th U.S. Court of Appeals again refused to block an order to release them, and in a hearing Wednesday Justice Department attorneys said they would make the tapes available to the civil lawsuit parties.</p>
<p>Access to the tapes is sought by plaintiffs in class-action suits against ADM and three other defendants -- A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co, a unit of Tate &amp; Lyle PLC, Cargill Inc, and American Maize Products Co. In their suits, plaintiffs claim they were harmed by alleged price fixing in the market for high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener used in foods and beverages.  </p>
<p>Judge Michael Mihm of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois also signed an order limiting access to the tapes to 19 attorneys, and each must sign a certificate promising strict confidentiality.</p>
<p>Last year, ADM pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of fixing prices of lysine, an animal feed additive, and citric acid, an additive used in foods and other products. The Decatur, Ill.-based agribusiness giant agreed to pay $100 million in fines.</p>
<p>ADM was given immunity from further prosecution under the federal investigation. It also settled some customer class-action lawsuits involving the two products.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has refused to turn over the tapes, contending they contain potential evidence in continuing criminal price-fixing investigations in Atlanta and San Francisco.</p>
