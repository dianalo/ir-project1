<p>Australian shares closed weaker on Friday as market leader BHP retraced some of its recent gains and gold miners followed the bullion price lower.</p>
<p>National Australia Bank was the star performer with its shares cracking a record high of A$14.42 (US$11.67) as buyers voiced their approval of Thursday's 6.8 percent rise in annual net profit to A$2.1 billion.</p>
<p>By the close, the All Ordinaries index shed 9.1 points to 2,383.4.</p>
<p>&quot;BHP came off again in the afternoon and the golds were hit after the price drop but the rest just muddled along,&quot; said a Sydney broker.</p>
<p>&quot;National Australia Bank had a good result Thursday and that helped the banks along.&quot;</p>
<p>Mining house CRA followed its dual listed twin RTZ Corp Plc into firmer territory, gaining five cents to A$20.05 in an overall weaker resources sector.</p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about seven to five, while about 30 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.81)</p>
