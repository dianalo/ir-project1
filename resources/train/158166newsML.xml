<title>NETHERLANDS: HEINEKEN CAUGHT UP IN CENTRAL AFRICA CHAOS.</title>
<headline>HEINEKEN CAUGHT UP IN CENTRAL AFRICA CHAOS.</headline>

<p>Dutch brewer Heineken NV's operations in Burundi and Zaire are being hit hard by the current ethnic conflict in central Africa, but the company has no plans to pull out, a spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're obviously losing a lot of money there, but we've been there for nearly 50 years and we feel we have a commitment to these countries,&quot; he said, declining to give financial details.</p>
<p>Heineken has been forced to close its 400,000 hectolitre-per-year capacity brewery in Bukavu, Zaire, an epicentre of battles between the Zairean army and Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels, and evacuate some of its 300 employees.</p>
<p>Depots near Bukavu on either side of the Rwandan border, at Uvera in Zaire and Cyangugu in Rwanda have also been closed down and evacuated, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We flew out those personnel who wished to leave to (the eastern Zairean town of) Goma. Since Tuesday we've had no contact with those who chose to stay in Bukavu and we are very, very worried.&quot;</p>
<p>The firm has 1,350 employees in Burundi and 3,000 in Zaire.</p>
<p>It owns 71 percent of Zairean brewer Bralima, which operates five breweries with a total annual capacity of around 2.4 million hectolitres.</p>
<p>In Burundi, it owns 60 percent of local brewer Brarudi, which has two plants producing 1.2 million hectolitres. The other 40 percent is owned by the state.</p>
<p>The main brewery in the Burundian capital, Bujumbura, is only producing at half-capacity, the spokesman said, while the second plant, in Gitaga, is no longer in operation.</p>
<p>Sanctions imposed against against the country after a Tutsi-led military takeover in July have left the brewery with at most five weeks' supply of malt and desperately short of fuel oil to power its electrical generators.</p>
<p>Distribution outside the capital has been stopped after four drivers were ambushed and murdered last month.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an impossible situation,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We're using up all our funds paying for fuel oil and salaries and basically we're eating up our own company there as we can't inject any money because of the embargo.&quot; -- Andrew Clark, Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
