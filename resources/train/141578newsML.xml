<headline>Lawyer accuses Simpson of killing in obsessive rage.</headline>

<p>An attorney told jurors on Wednesday that behind O.J. Simpson's smiling public mask was a man so obsessed with his ex-wife that he killed her in a violent rage when he could no longer control her.</p>
<p>In an impassioned opening statement in Simpson's civil trial, John Kelly, an attorney for Nicole Brown Simpson's estate, mounted a scathing attack that had the former football star squirming in his seat in the crowded courtroom.</p>
<p>&quot;The evidence and testimony will take you beneath the polished veneer to a sometimes dark, violent and frightening world of uncontrollable rage,&quot; Kelly said.</p>
<p>It was the clearest sign yet that lawyers for the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman hope to strip away whatever is left of Simpson's celebrity image and use his history of domestic violence as a motive for the killings.</p>
<p>Simpson, who was acquitted of murder on Oct. 3, 1995, after a year-long trial, is now in civil court facing a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the victims' families.</p>
<p>Describing Simpson's ego as &quot;larger than life,&quot; Kelly told jurors that Nicole Brown Simpson &quot;publicly pierced its core&quot; by rejecting him, first in their 1992 divorce and again just before the 1994 murders when she broke off an attempt at reconciliation.</p>
<p>&quot;It was his frustration with his growing loss of control, his exclusion from her life and that family that led to the murders,&quot; Kelly said.</p>
<p>Simpson became agitated during Kelly's presentation, frequently whispering with his lawyers as the attorney recounted his alleged abuse of his ex-wife.</p>
<p>Simpson's lawyers, who were due to begin their opening statement on Thursday, are expected to counter the plaintiffs' strategy by claiming that the domestic violence has been exaggerated and is irrelevant to the case.</p>
<p>The courtroom was packed for Wednesday's session. Members of the mostly white jury -- a reversal in the racial makeup of the criminal trial's mostly black panel -- listened attentively. Simpson's elderly mother, Eunice, looked on from her wheelchair. Some of the victims' relatives sat sobbing in the spectators' gallery.</p>
<p>Goldman family attorney Daniel Petrocelli began opening arguments branding Simpson a &quot;vengeful killer&quot; and vowing to prove that he committed the brutal murders on June 12, 1994, outside his ex-wife's Brentwood townhouse.</p>
<p>He told jurors Goldman died &quot;with his eyes open&quot; and the last thing he saw was the man who killed him and his friend. &quot;They were defenceless against a man who was large, strong, armed with a six-inch (15-cm) knife and in a state of rage,&quot; Petrocelli said.</p>
<p>Describing a trail of bloody evidence he said linked Simpson to the murders, Kelly said: &quot;It was as if Mr. Simpson left a note pinned to those two bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>Petrocelli promised to present evidence that jurors in the criminal trial never heard about -- Simpson's statement to police, the so-called &quot;suicide&quot; note he left behind and the freeway chase that led to his arrest.</p>
<p>And he said one of the nation's leading pathologists, Werner Spitz, who helped to investigate the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., would testify that the cuts on Simpson's hand were gouges caused by the fingernails of one of the victims.</p>
<p>In another new twist, the plaintiffs' attorneys said that at the time of Simpson's arrest, he was carrying keys to the rear gate of his ex-wife's townhouse that the killer would have needed to enter the property.</p>
<p>Simpson's lawyers are expected to use many of the same claims of police frameup and evidence of contamination that won an acquittal in the criminal trial.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki has banned cameras and microphones, blacking out the proceedings to millions of TV viewers who followed the first trial.</p>
<p>Dozens of camera crews swarmed the lawn outside the Santa Monica courthouse on Wednesday, and a handful of demonstrators and publicity seekers turned out. But it was far more subdued scene than the media frenzy that surrounded the first trial.</p>
<p>Simpson never took the witness stand during the last trial but he will be forced to testify in civil court. He cannot be punished with jail but he could be forced to pay millions in damages if found &quot;liable&quot; for the murders.</p>
