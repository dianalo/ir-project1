<title>CHILE: Carter willing to mediate in Peruvian standoff.</title>
<headline>Carter willing to mediate in Peruvian standoff.</headline>
<dateline>SANTIAGO 1997-01-16</dateline>

<p>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said on Thursday he would be &quot;delighted&quot; to mediate in the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru if both sides asked.</p>
<p>Carter, an experienced negotiator in trouble spots around the world, said during a visit to Chile that his Atlanta-based Carter Centre would be happy to help resolve the standoff.</p>
<p>&quot;A prerequisite to any mediation is to be accepted as a mediator and requested by both parties to a dispute,&quot; he said, asked if he would be willing to mediate in the standoff in which Marxist rebels are holding 74 hostages.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Carter Centre were asked by both sides to help with the resolution of the dispute in Lima, we would be delighted to comply with the request,&quot; he told a news conference after meeting Chilean President Eduardo Frei.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement have been holding hostages since Dec. 17 after blasting their way into a reception at the ambassador's house. They are demanding the release of about 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>Carter, once detested by Chile's former military rulers for his criticism of their abuses of human rights, shook hands warmly with President Eduardo Frei and was declared an illustrious citizen of Santiago by Mayor Jaime Ravinet.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Moneda presidential palace bombed in Chile's 1973 military coup, Carter said Latin America had seen an &quot;almost miraculous&quot; move toward democracy in the past 20 years with a couple of exceptions.</p>
<p>Carter arrived on Wednesday on a private visit as part of a Latin American tour including Argentina, Brazil and Jamaica.</p>
