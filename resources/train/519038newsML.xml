<title>THAILAND: Thai rice firms on loadings, Iran buys more.</title>
<headline>Thai rice firms on loadings, Iran buys more.</headline>

<p>Thai rice prices firmed this week as more ships were sent in for loading and more buying emerged, trade sources said.</p>
<p>Iran bought an additional 60,000 tonnes of 100 percent B grade from Thailand for May/August shipments, they said. But price details were not available.</p>
<p>Iran earlier this month bought the same amount from Thai exporters for similar shipments for $330 per tonne FOB Bangkok.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices edged up, after a recent dry spell of new leads, due to demand to cover obligations, mostly to the Philippines and fresh buying interest,&quot; said a trader from one major Thai exporter.</p>
<p>The Philippines bought 205,000 tonnes of 25 percent grade rice from Thailand at $300 per tonne.</p>
<p>A senior commerce ministry official told Reuters that Iraq also entered the market to seek more rice but there was no deal yet.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard they are talking to a few traders here for more rice after buying around $21 million worth of Thai rice earlier this year,&quot; the official said.  </p>
<p>The official, who is in charge of rice trading, said the prices of the second rice crop which is estimated at 4.06 million tonnes were expected to be supported by robust demand during the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for rice in the second quarter will remain robust. The ministry is negotiating with potential buyers in Africa, Middle East and Asia for more rice contracts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We also asked the Philippines to consider buying Thai rice if it plans to purchase more under its rice procurement programme. The rice prices initially went down a lot when the fresh second crop supplies entered the market. But we expect that to be brief,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government put the rice export target for 1997 at 5.5 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>Following are the indication prices of Thai rice (in tonnes on FOB basis):</p>
<p>					  Thursday	April 10</p>
<p>100 percent B grade		 $325-360	$310-350</p>
<p>100 percent fragrant		$660-695	$670-690</p>
