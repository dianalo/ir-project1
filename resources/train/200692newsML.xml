<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday condemned the beating of Palestinians by two paramilitary border policemen caught on an amateur video and detained after its worldwide broadcast.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot accept it. It is unpardonable. It flies in the face of the strict standards of conduct that are kept by the overwhelming majority of Israeli soldiers and police,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been assured by the minister of police that they will be...put on trial and that the full weight of the law will be applied against these people,&quot; he said. &quot;They have no place in our security apparatus.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinians frequently complain of abuse by the border police that patrol Israeli cities and the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, there isn't always a camera to capture the horror,&quot; said Left-wing legislator Dedi Zucker.</p>
<p>The video, which Israel's state-owned Channel One television said was recorded last month by an amateur Palestinian cameraman, showed two policemen lashing out at six Palestinians caught in Jerusalem without work permits.</p>
<p>In the courtyard of an apartment complex, the two policemen kicked some of the Palestinians in the head, kneed another in the stomach and made others lie on the ground and do push-ups.</p>
<p>The Channel One report on Monday said the abuse went on for 45 minutes. The video was later broadcast by foreign television stations.</p>
<p>A Justice Ministry spokeswoman said the two policemen were detained on Tuesday for 24 hours. She said they would be questioned by a department in the ministry that investigates alleged police misdeeds.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Assaf Hefetz has suspended the two, described by Israeli media reports as young conscripts, whose names were not released. Jews and Druze Arabs serve in the border police.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a high level of frustration among border policemen -- a small number of whom vent it in a very negative way,&quot; Border Police chief Yisrael Sadan was quoted as saying by Israel's Itim news agency.</p>
<p>The Information Ministry of the Palestinian Authority issued a statement saying the two policemen were products of Israel's &quot;racist&quot; teachings.</p>
<p>&quot;The sadists and killers are backed by a system that allows them to commit crimes without facing any punishment,&quot; it said, alluding to a symbolic fine of one agora (a third of a U.S. cent) imposed by a military court on Sunday on four Israeli soldiers who shot dead a Palestinian at a West Bank roadblock.</p>
<p>The court found the men, members of an undercover army unit in which Israeli soldiers disguise themselves as Arabs, had violated &quot;open-fire&quot; procedures in the 1993 incident. The army has said it would appeal for a tougher sentence.</p>
<p>Israel has given Palestinians limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank under Israel-PLO peace deals signed since 1993 but Israeli troops still patrol much of the area.</p>
