<p>Russia's communist opposition won the governorship of the southern Stavropol region in a weekend poll but the Kremlin said on Monday it was still ahead in a series of regional elections.</p>
<p>Communist candidate Alexander Chernogorov won 55 percent of the vote in a runoff in Stavropol against Kremlin-appointed Pyotr Marchenko, who got just over 40 percent. The remaining votes were cast against both candidates.</p>
<p>In six other regional elections at the weekend, only one Kremlin-backed candidate held onto power. A second round runoff will be needed to decide the outcome in three of the regions.</p>
<p>Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said he was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the victory in Stavropol, a major agricultural region which voted communist in July's presidential election.</p>
<p>Sergei Filatov, a former Kremlin chief-of-staff, acknowledged that the defeat was a disappointment for President Boris Yeltsin although it had been expected by liberals.</p>
<p>&quot;We have lost a very important region,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;The democratic forces in the region were not united.&quot;</p>
<p>But shrugging off the defeat, the Kremlin said reformers were ahead overall in elections which will choose the leaders of 52 of Russia's 89 regions by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The score so far is 17-4 to the reformist forces,&quot; Kremlin deputy chief-of-staff Alexander Kazakov told reporters.</p>
<p>In his count he included not only re-elected governors but also new governors who he believes are pro-reform. The opposition says the score is much closer and points out that few pro-Yeltsin governors had been re-elected.</p>
<p>Despite Kazakov's remarks, Yeltsin and Kremlin chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais have expressed their concern at the situation in the regions in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The elections are important because regional leaders sit on the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, giving them a voice in national legislation and other matters of state.</p>
<p>The elections could shift the balance in the chamber, which has been dominated until now by regional leaders appointed by Yeltsin after the collapse of communist rule, and also weaken the Kremlin's ability to influence the regions.</p>
<p>Some democrats are worried that voters will use the elections to show their dissatisfaction with the bad economic situation, despite re-electing Yeltsin on July 3.</p>
<p>&quot;Voting in the regions, especially at the moment, is a protest vote,&quot; liberal leader Irina Khakamada told reporters.</p>
<p>In the weekend elections, communist-backed Alexander Surikov led in the south Siberian region of Altai with more than 46 percent of votes but failed to get the more than 50 percent of votes needed for outright victory in the first round.</p>
<p>In Murmansk in the far north governor Yevgeny Komarov was leading with 32 percent, far ahead of his rivals.</p>
<p>In Kamchatka region in the far east, governor Vladimir Biryukov led with some 48 percent.</p>
<p>Voting also took place in three autonomous ethnic areas. In the Komi-Permyatsk area, part of Tyumen region in western Siberia, incumbent governor Nikolai Poluyanov was re-elected.</p>
<p>In the Koryak autonomous area, part of the Kamchatka region, the governorship was won by woman lawyer Valentina Bronievich.</p>
<p>In the Ust-Ordynsk Buryat autonomous area, part of Irkutsk region in central Siberia, voters elected Valery Maleyev, the director of a state farm.</p>
