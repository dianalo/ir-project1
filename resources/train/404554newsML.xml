<p>Tax cuts proposed by Senate Republicans mainly favour affluent Americans over time and their costs increase after 2002, the target year for achieving a balanced budget, a research group said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning organisation, issued a report expressing concern over the Senate leadership's proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;These new tax cut proposals are of particular concern,&quot; Iris Lav, associate director at the centre, said, &quot;because they are built around a series of devices that keep their costs artificially low between now and 2002.&quot;</p>
<p>Three tax breaks that primarily benefit upper-income taxpayers were a capital gains tax cut, increased tax preferences for individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and tax cuts on large estates passed on to heirs, the centre said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unlikely that budget cuts of the magnitude needed to maintain budget balance if these tax cuts are approved would be achievable and sustainable,&quot; Robert Greenstein, the center's executive director, said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is because the capital gains, IRA and estate tax cuts explode in cost after 2002 while the cost of the child credit declines that the Leadership tax package is, over the long term, primarily a tax relief package for high-income households,&quot; the study said.</p>
<p>The child tax credit is the main piece of the Senate Republican package that primarily benefits middle-income taxpayers, but still favours the top half of the income scale because most children of low- or moderate-income families would either be ineligible or qualify for a partial credit, the study said.</p>
<p>Also benefiting middle-income families were provisions to allow withdrawal of funds from IRAs free of penalty for purposes such as college education or starting a business and tax incentives for certain education savings and spending, the study said.</p>
<p>Those three middle-class provisions accounted for 61 percent of the cost of the Republican tax proposal in the first five years, but in the second five years they were 33 percent of the overall tax cut costs, the study said.</p>
<p>&quot;In short, after the first few years, the proportion of the tax cuts going to middle-class families declines sharply while the proportion going to high-income families and individuals shoots up,&quot; the study said.</p>
<p>The study said that President Clinton's tax cut proposals were less costly and more targeted to middle-income families, compared with the Senate Republican plan. Clinton has proposed $98 billion in tax cuts over five years, while Republicans have proposed nearly double that amount.</p>
