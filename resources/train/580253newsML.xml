<p>A Beirut military magistrate demanded on Tuesday at least five years' hard labour for 13 Lebanese men including a television journalist on charges of collaborating with Israel.</p>
<p>In two separate indictments, Judge Riad Talee' charged 10 suspects in custody and three in absentia with &quot;contacting the Israeli enemy and its agents and passing information to Israel&quot;.</p>
<p>The indictments brought to 104 the number of people charged this year with collaborating with Israel, with which Lebanon is formally at war.</p>
<p>&quot;Judge Talee' demanded at least five years' hard labour for the 13,&quot; one judicial source said.</p>
<p>No date has been fixed for the trials.</p>
<p>The first indictment was issued against a Lebanese Army corporal, an adjutant, a former sergeant, an inspector in the General Security agency, journalist Tony Chamie and two other civilians -- one of whom is on the run.</p>
<p>It said Chamie, a 38-year-old editor of the daily news programme at the privately owned ICN TV who was arrested in March, was recruited to work for Israeli intelligence for $500 a month by Elias Hallit, a Lebanese civilian who is under arrest.</p>
<p>Reporters sans Frontieres, a Paris-based press freedom watchdog, last month appealed to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri to secure Chamie's release if his arrest was connected with his political opinions or his journalistic activity.</p>
<p>The indictment said Chamie in turn recruited his brother-in-law, General Security inspector Tony Abou Moussa, to work for Israeli intelligence for a similar salary.</p>
<p>&quot;Chamie, who worked at the time for the private Lebanese television station ICN, provided Hallit with footage of Hizbollah military operations&quot;, the indictment said.</p>
<p>He continued to do so after moving to another channel, Murr Television in 1995, it added. Abou Moussa also provided Israeli intelligence with information about the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) and Palestinian factions in the eastern Bekaa Valley, it said.</p>
<p>Six men including a lawyer and the head of the Guardians of the Cedars, a small Christian militia in the 1975-90 civil war, were charged with collaborating with Israel in the second indictment.</p>
<p>Lawyer Elias Khalil and Antoine Youssef Boulos were charged with &quot;concluding commercial deals with residents in Israel&quot;. Boulous was also charged with the &quot;ownership of unlicensed arms and hand grenades&quot;.</p>
<p>The indictment said Boulos travelled to Israel at Khalil's request to look for buyers of Lebanese-owned land there. He made contact with Israeli intelligence and Khalil cooperated with him.</p>
<p>In 1992, Boulos tipped off the Mossad about a possible attack against Israeli targets in Latin America just before a bomb at the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires killed 29 people, the indictment added.</p>
<p>Etian Saqr, former head of the Guardians of the Cedars, was charged in absentia. Saqr was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia last December for collaboration with Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon.</p>
