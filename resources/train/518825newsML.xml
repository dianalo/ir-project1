<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - April 17 ---------------</p>
<p>Copper has found a comfortable range for the time being between $2,245 and $2,290, but continued upside failures could send prices down to probe the bottom of the band, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Aluminium may drift down to the February low of $1,534, but that is expected to hold, they added.  </p>
<p>COPPER -</p>
<p>Having explored the upper and lower areas of the range, copper seemed content to remain above Monday's low of $2,245 and below Wednesday's high of $2,293 for the short term.</p>
<p>The 10-day moving average at $2,292 helped inhibit moves towards $2,300 on Wednesday while the 100-day moving average at $2,260 was to be watched on the downside.</p>
<p>One technical analyst noted that the 14-day/12-day stochastics were low at 15.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see it collapsing, I really don't see it doing much,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Weakness might sending prices slipping to $2,220, but downside potential was not great in the short term, he added.</p>
<p>Chartist Harry Creates of broker AMT, however, said a sloping head and shoulders pattern was still intact and eventually could target $2,120, $2,040 or $1,980.</p>
<p>At 0755 GMT three months LME copper was quoted at $2,265/69, up $3/$4 from Wednesday's late close.  </p>
<p>ALUMINIUM -</p>
<p>This market, like copper was seen largely holding in a $1,540-$1,565 range, with any downside move bottoming out at the year's low of $1,534.</p>
<p>&quot;The appearance of a small bearish engulfing pattern on the candlestick chart indicates a test of support around $1,535,&quot; said broker Brandeis in a commmentary.</p>
<p>Broker Gerald agreed that the downside could be inviting.</p>
<p>&quot;Look for a test of the $1,530/35 support now that it has failed to make any kind of run at the upside,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>But scope at the lower levels was limited since the market was oversold, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the market is looking rather oversold with the RSI at 32.1,&quot; Brandeis said. Another chartist noted that the 14-day/12-day stochastics were very low at nine percent.</p>
<p>Resisance was pegged around Monday's high of $1,566.</p>
<p>At 0805 GMT three months aluminium was quoted at $1,550/53, up $3 from Wednesday's late close.</p>
