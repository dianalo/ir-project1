<headline>CRICKET - Rixon calling the shots, claims Morrison.</headline>
<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, March 11 - New Zealand's Australian cricket coach Steve Rixon is calling the shots over team selection, experienced fast bowler Danny Morrison claimed on Tuesday after being overlooked for the final home test of the summer.</p>
<p>Convener of selectors Ross Dykes added untried 22-year-old Central Districts seamer Andrew Penn and experienced medium-pacer Gavin Larsen to the New Zealand squad for the second test against Sri Lanka starting in Hamilton on Friday.  </p>
<p>The New Zealanders face problems in their new-ball department for the match, with Canterbury seamer Geoff Allott out with injury and Wellington's Heath Davis battling to overcome problems with an Achilles tendon and a knee.</p>
<p>Morrison, 31, had been a regular test player until being dropped after the first test against England this summer.</p>
<p>He was returning from a serious groin injury in that match and struggled for pace and direction, and on Tuesday admitted he was frustrated at not being given another chance to impress Rixon.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously Steve Rixon is the guy making the calls, and he really doesn't know me,&quot; Morrison told NZPA.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always been a slow starter and Steve being from outside wouldn't know that.&quot;</p>
<p>Morrison said that while it was a matter of taking his continued non-selection on the chin, he was frustrated by the lack of opportunities to show that he had returned to form.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically all I got was the game in Palmerston North (for New Zealand A) where I took four wickets for 80 against England and then we went to the Eden Park test,&quot; Morrison said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We only bowled once in that game, even then it was in difficult conditions, but the worst thing is I haven't been given a chance since then.&quot;</p>
<p>However Morrison said he understood where the selectors were coming from in picking the raw Penn.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see what they're trying to do; there are scenarios for them to look at as far as the future goes, but still it makes it frustrating for me,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;When you look at the deck they had in Wellington and then the deck they had in Dunedin during the first test against Sri Lanka, it makes it tough knowing you could have done well there.&quot;</p>
<p>Morrison took three wickets for 30 and then three wickets for just five runs when Auckland crushed Northern Districts at Hamilton during their first-class Shell Trophy match there this summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The pitch was doing a fair bit there and again it leaves you wondering about what you could do,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It might look as though I didn't get too many wickets there but then when you look at the Auckland seam bowling lineup it is very strong and we do share it around.&quot;</p>
<p>Morrison said he would continue to play first-class cricket and make himself available for the New Zealand team for at least the next two years.</p>
<p>He is also currently working on an autobiography.</p>
