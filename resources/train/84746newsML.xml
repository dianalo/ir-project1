<p>The historic first meeting of Bosnia's three-man presidency ended on Monday after almost four hours of talks in a motel on the outskirts of Sarajevo, International High Representative Carl Bildt said.</p>
<p>The presidency chairman Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic, the Serb representative Momcilo Krajisnik and Croat Kresimir Zubak concluded their meeting around 8:45 p.m. (1845 GMT) without giving any statements.</p>
<p>The trio, all war-time leaders and one-time enemies, convened on their own without aides or mediators in a small first-floor room at the Saraj Motel on the eastern edge of the city centre, said Bildt who was at the start of the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;They met,&quot; he said. &quot;They have started the process of setting up the common institutions. They appealed to all of the media to stress what unites and not what divides, and work for the unity of the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Bildt said all three former foes shook hands to open the session, and concluded it with another round of hand-shaking.</p>
<p>He said they held between three and four hours of talks between themselves without the help of aides, followed by a concluding session with himself and a number of other officials.</p>
<p>&quot;A business-like session and a buisness-like atmosphere. Of course a long way to go, but they started and that's good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>According to a joint statement issued after the meeting, one of the presidency's first decisions was to convene a meeting of Bosnia's federal House of Representatives on October 5th, when it would also hold its next meeting.</p>
<p>They also agreed to form a small, compact council of ministers by October 30th, which will include foreign and trade ministries. Under the Dayton peace accord, most administrative responsibilites have been devolved to the two entities -- the Serb republic and the Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is important because it opens the possibility of starting talks with international financial institutions about reconstruction aid to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>In a move resolving a continuing point of friction between the former rivals, the presidency also agreed to release all prisoners immediately, apart from those under investigation by the international War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.</p>
<p>And the trio also decided to end one of the most sensitive technical barriers to unity, by restoring telecommunications links across the ethnic divide.</p>
<p>Earlier, international mediators had struggled for two weeks to broker an agreement over the venue for the first session.</p>
<p>Izetbegovic and Zubak both wanted the meeting in central Sarajevo, but Krajisnik said he did not feel safe there, and wanted to convene the presidency on the boundary line between the Serb republic and the Moslem-Croat federation.</p>
<p>Security services had thrown a tight cordon around the building. Reporters said they blocked all traffic and pedestrians from moving within half a kilometre (500 yards) of the motel and towed any parked cars away.</p>
<p>The presidency, charged with governing a union of Serb and Moslem-Croat territories, was chosen in Bosnia's first post-war general election on September 14.</p>
<p>Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, won most votes in the presidential race and will serve as the body's chairman for a two-year term.</p>
<p>Izetbegovic narrowly defeated Krajisnik, his sworn enemy during 3-1/2 years of war, for the chairman's post.</p>
<p>Bildt said although the meeting was not without its problems they were off to a positive start. &quot;They are assuming authority over the country and the fact that they are doing this within 24 hours of certification of election results -- I think this is a good sign,&quot; he said.</p>
