<p>The Indian rupee ended at 35.780/795 per dollar on Friday, up from the day's opening level of 35.80/81, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The rupee rose on lack of (dollar) demand,&quot; said a dealer. A leading state-run bank, whose buying and selling moves the market, was not active on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;His quotes indicated he had no specific interest today,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;The market was quiet,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are getting used to sharp two-way movements,&quot; said a dealer, referring to rupee's fall to 35.86 earlier this week. Memories of one-way movement are still fresh, one dealer said, referring to the free fall of the rupee in February this year.</p>
<p>The rupee has recovered towards the close of trading after every sharp reversal in recent weaks.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the rupee closes below 35.88, talk of rupee testing the 36 per dollar level seem to be premature,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>Forward dollar premia were steady for most of the day but slipped marginally towards the close after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened, dealers said.</p>
<p>June dollars opened the day at 1.50/1.53 rupees but fell by about three paise after RBI's intervention, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six-month annualised premium closed at 7.55 percent, down from the previous close of 7.60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Forwards are edging to our this fortnight's target of 7.50 percent thanks to RBI's December/May rollover of swaps,&quot; a dealer at a European bank said earlier in a commentary.</p>
<p>&quot;Though it goes well with falling interest rate scenario, banks will look to pay on dips in view of the bruised market sentiment,&quot; he said.</p>
