<p>The Indian government will wait for stock prices to strengthen before launching an ambitious plan to sell more than $1 billion worth of shares in state-owned firms, Industry Minister Murasoli Maran said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends upon the market conditions,&quot; Maran told Reuters when asked when the government would begin the first round of a partial sell-off of shares in state-owned firms planned for the 1996/97 fiscal year ending March 31.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to wait for a better price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Bombay bourse, the country's leading stock market, hit a three-year low in December before rebounding early this month following assurances by the government that it would announce measures to revive markets.</p>
<p>The government has set a target of raising 50 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in 1996/97 from divestments, or the sale of partial stakes in state-controlled firms.</p>
<p>Last year India raised 3.57 billion rupees from divestment, well short of its target of 70 billion.</p>
<p>India began selling partial equity stakes in state-owned companies in 1991/92 as part of an economic liberalisation programme launched by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.</p>
<p>India has planned to sell a seven percent stake in telecommunications firm Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) and five percent in crude oil refining company Indian Oil Corp (IOC) in the first round of divestment in 1996/97.</p>
<p>But the government has not yet been able to fix a date for kicking off the first round of divestment. &quot;We cannot sell our crown jewels just for a song,&quot; Maran said, speaking on the margins of a meeting of the heads of state-owned companies.</p>
<p>The head of the newly formed Disinvestment Commission, G.V. Ramakrishna, has said the government should first overhaul the state-firms before putting them on the selling block.</p>
<p>The commission was set up by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda last year to advise the government.</p>
<p>The Disinvestment Commission is not responsible for the first two rounds, but will make recommendations on divestment in 40 state-owned firms for a third tranche.</p>
<p>Ramakrishna told reporters last week that the divestment process had failed in the past because the proceeds had been used to plug a fiscal deficit and stakes had been sold only to a limited number of institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial restructuring and disinvestment can proceed simultaneously,&quot; Usha Roy, chairman of state-owned Bharat Aluminium Co Ltd, told Reuters. &quot;Financial restructuring will fetch a better price.&quot;</p>
<p>Many chiefs of state firms feel the government should plough the proceeds from of the sale of shares back into the state enterprises and not use them to cut the fiscal deficit.</p>
<p>Maran said the government was not in favour of closing down or selling-off loss-making units. He urged the heads of the state firms to suggest steps to restructure and improve the profitability of the enterprises.</p>
