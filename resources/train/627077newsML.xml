<p>The chief executive and president of Gucci Group N.V. said Friday he was comfortable with analysts' consensus estimate for fiscal 1997 earnings of $3.35 per share.</p>
<p>&quot;We are comfortable with the estimate,&quot; Domenico De Sole told Reuters in a telephone interview from Florence, Italy. The luxury goods company recorded earnings of $2.76 a share in fiscal 1996.  </p>
<p>He declined to discuss the consensus estimate of $3.90 a share for fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>Gucci reported Thursday that first-quarter sales rose 31.5 percent from a year earlier, to $254.3 million, beyond the company's expectations.</p>
<p>Gucci's American Depositary Receipts were up one at 69-1/2 after falling 5-7/8 in heavy trade Thursday.</p>
<p>De Sole said Gucci's results were &quot;absolutely excellent, especially since the first quarter includes April, which was a weak month for the industry.&quot;  </p>
<p>De Sole said Gucci had been hurt by a weaker yen that cut into purchases by Japanese consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;The yen went down dramatically and that slowed down the travel by Japanese customers. That has an impact on the entire luxury industry,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The April weakness in sales could extend &quot;for the next couple of months,&quot; but the recent strengthening of the yen could help revenues, he said.</p>
<p>On April 1 De Sole told Reuters he was comfortable with analysts' estimate that Gucci would earn $3.30 a share for fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>He provided the $3.35 figure to Reuters today.</p>
