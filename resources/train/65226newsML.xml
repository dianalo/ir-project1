<p>U.S. demand for petroleum products rose just 0.5 percent in August from a year ago to 18.13 million barrels per day (bpd), the American Petroleum Institute said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Demand, as measured by deliveries, rose for distillates, jet fuel and residual fuel but dropped for gasoline.</p>
<p>U.S. oil imports continued their steep climb, with crude imports up 7.2 percent to 7.973 million bpd and petroleum product imports up 8.9 percent to 1.769 million bpd, API said in its monthly report.  </p>
<p>But matching EIA's tally, API reported distillate stocks at 109.7 million barrels, down 16 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>Total gasoline deliveries fell 1.7 percent from a year ago to 8.045 million bpd, defying expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;Strong economic growth and the moderation in prices over the past several months suggest that actual consumption would have risen around 1 to 1.5 percent for the month,&quot; API said.</p>
<p>Jet kerosine demand rose 6.4 percent to 1.601 million bpd, while residual fuel demand rose 3.1 percent to 845,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Refinery use at 94 percent of capacity in August was on par with last year's level, but rose 135,000 bpd from July.</p>
<p>Total petroleum stocks at the end of August stood at 964.5 million barrels, down 5.7 percent from August 1995, although crude stocks were up 1.4 percent to 312.2 million barrels.</p>
<p>U.S. crude production, including condensate, dipped 0.7 percent to 6.405 million bpd in August from a year ago.  </p>
<p>Deliveries of distillates -- heating oil and diesel -- grew 3.3 percent to 3.143 million bpd.</p>
<p>Distillate imports stayed around 200,000 bpd, where they have been since May. From January through August, distillate imports, which came mostly from the western hemisphere, averaged 230,000 bpd, up 20 percent from last year, API said.</p>
<p>While the U.S. Energy Information Administration this week warned that distillate stocks were low, API noted that refinery yields of distillate in August &quot;were the highest in at least twenty years for this time of year&quot; despite a loss of output from the closed Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania.</p>
