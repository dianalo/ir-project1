<p>Qantas Airways Ltd chairman Gary Pemberton said on Thursday the airline expected to have a proposal to deal with its current foreign ownership restrictions by its annual meeting later in 1997.</p>
<p>Pemberton said Qantas was examining various options for dealing with the currently ad hoc arrangement for restricting foreign ownership of Qantas shares to below 50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We have identified a number of options and we're thinking through the implications of those,&quot; Pemberton told a news conference after releasing the group's first half results.  </p>
<p>Foreigners currently own about 48 percent of Qantas but the level of foreign shareholdings often exceeds 50 percent.</p>
<p>Under government imposed restrictions, foreigners cannot own more than 49 percent of Qantas.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to resolve this and we would expect to have something to present to the annual meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Whenever foreign ownership has exceeded 50 percent in the past, Qantas has had to issue a warning to shareholders, simply asking them to reduce their stakes.  </p>
<p>Several options have been suggested, including the creation of a separate class of shares for foreign owners similar to the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; class shares used by Air New Zealand.</p>
<p>British Airways owns about 25 percent of Qantas.</p>
