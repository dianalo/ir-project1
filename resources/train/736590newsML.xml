<title>USA: Apple second-quarter loss less than expected.</title>
<headline>Apple second-quarter loss less than expected.</headline>

<p>Apple Computer Inc. reported a loss for the latest quarter that was far lower than Wall Street expected, but said it will not return to profitability later this year, as it had predicted.</p>
<p>For its fiscal third quarter ended on June 27, Apple had a loss of $56 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a loss of $32 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's results included a $39 million gain on an investment.</p>
<p>The report by the computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., came nearly a week after it ousted Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gilbert Amelio.</p>
<p>Analysts had forecast a loss of 61 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.</p>
<p>Revenue fell 23 percent to $1.7 billion from $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Apple said it had strong sales in educational markets and abroad, contributing to a 6 percent increase in revenue from the fiscal second quarter, ended in March.</p>
<p>But the company said it will not report a profit in its fourth quarter. Apple executives said earlier this year that the company could report a profit as early as the September quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The company continues to progress with its restructuring initiatives, as is evidenced by the significant sequential decrease in operating expenses,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said in a statement.</p>
