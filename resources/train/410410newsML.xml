<text>
<p>Shanghai's B share index ended slightly up on Friday on domestic buying helped by gains on the A share market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index edged up 0.17 points or 0.25 percent to 67.157 points on volume of 17.64 million worth $7.88 million.</p>
<p>Brokers said rises on the A share market prompted increased buying by domestic investors on the B share market, resulting in Friday's rises.</p>
<p>The A index rose 16.018 points or 1.5 percent to 1,087.423 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors dominated recent market movements because they believe that most B share prices are better value than A shares,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Another broker said he expected the index to move in a narrow range early next week as the market awaits the issue of annual reports.</p>
<p>All listed companies are required to issue annual reports by April 30.</p>
<p>Of 43 B shares, 42 traded, with 19 up, eight flat and 15 down.  </p>
<p>Tientsin Marine Shipping was the star on a technical rebound after sharp losses over the past few days, rising $0.024 or 5.42 percent to $0.466 on volume of 1.1 million shares.</p>
<p>The most active counter Shanghai Haixin  9009.SS followed, helped by talk of better 1996 results. It gained $0.022 or 4.7 percent to $0.490 on volume of 1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai A shares reversed early losses on market expectations of an exchange announcement after the close, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The Shanghai stock exchange issued a circular late in the afternoon ordering all brokerages to publicise each day's five most active stocks and the major traders starting next Monday.</p>
<p>A total of 628 million shares worth six billion yuan were traded. The SSE30 index rose 18.162 points or 0.65 percent to 2819.398 points.</p>
<p>Yanzhong Industry was the biggest gainer on speculative buying, surging 0.94 yuan or 10.04 percent to 10.3 yuan on volume of 9.5 million.</p>
