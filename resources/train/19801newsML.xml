<headline>Hijacking by Iraqis poses dilemma for Britain.</headline>

<p>British police on Wednesday questioned seven Iraqis who hijacked a Sudanese jet with 199 people aboard in an apparent asylum bid as the government faced a dilemma over whether they should be deported.</p>
<p>&quot;Seven people are in custody and they will all be interviewed separately today,&quot; a police spokeswoman said. &quot;Interpreters have been brought in and it will be a lenghty process.&quot;</p>
<p>Police added that six women, believed to be relatives of the hijackers, were also being held and would be questioned about any involvement in the hijacking. Two children, aged under 10, were being looked after by police.</p>
<p>The Iraqis, who claimed during eight hours of negotiations with British police that they were &quot;ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam (Hussein)&quot;, left the Airbus A-310 airliner at Stansted airport north of London with their hands held high over their heads on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum. The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Larnaca, Cyprus, if they weren't taken to London.</p>
<p>One passenger said fighting broke out in the plane on the way to Cyprus and people were terrified as a man was stabbed by one of the hijackers. Police said they could not comment about any incident during the flight.</p>
<p>After a complete search of the aircraft police found only knives and fake explosives.</p>
<p>Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Michael Howard defended his decision to let the plane land in Britain and emphasised the gravity of the crime. &quot;I believe that those who are guilty of the serious offence of hijacking should be brought to justice for it,&quot; he told BBC radio.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question...of considering any claim for asylum until the claim for criminal proceedings has been resolved. After that question has been resolved, then, if they make a application for asylum we are obliged to consider it.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that if they are found guilty of a particular crime it could bar them from asylum.</p>
<p>If the Iraqis are prosecuted and found guilty of hijacking they could face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Police declined to confirm press reports the men were Iraqi officials serving in Sudan. &quot;We are not identifying them in any way at the moment,&quot; the spokeswomen added.</p>
<p>But Iraq was quick to deny rumours that the hijackers were diplomats. Abd-al-Samad Hamid, Iraq's ambassador in Khartoum, said the passenger list only included one diplomat who had nothing to do with the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;On the contrary, that diplomat was harassed by the hijackers,&quot; INA, the Iraqi news agency, quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The last hijacking at Stansted airport in 1982, when the pilot of an Air Tanzanian aircraft was shot and wounded, resulted in a three-year prison sentence for Yassin Membar, one of the assailants. He is still in Britain.</p>
<p>David Howell, Conservative chairman of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, warned of setting a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>&quot;If the word gets round that the quick way to asylum is three years in jail and then you're out, and in the country where you wanted to get to, that would be absolutely disastrous to the whole policy towards asylum seekers.&quot;</p>
