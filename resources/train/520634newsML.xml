<p>Lockheed Martin Corp's choice of president and chief operating officer Vance Coffman to succeed chief executive officer Norman Augustine, an architect of the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger, shows a shift in emphasis from acquisitions to day-to-day performance, analysts said Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Norm has been the corporate strategist, laying down the overall direction in the merger and acquisition end of things, but he has not done the operational stuff,&quot; Bankers Trust analyst Wolfgang Demisch said.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Friday Lockheed said Coffman would succeed Augustine as CEO effective August 1. Augustine said he was retiring to pursue outside interests.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the corporate structure is set and for the next few years the challenge is day-to-day execution at the kind of profit that investors expect,&quot; Demisch said. &quot;Coffman has done this repeatedly and with great success.&quot;</p>
<p>Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co, agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;Coffman is a good solid operating manager while Augustine was really the architect, the visionary of the consolidation,&quot; von Rumohr said.  </p>
<p>Augustine, who was chairman and CEO of the former Martin Marietta, was credited with assembling Martin Marietta into a satellite and rocket giant, culminating in the 1995 merger with Lockheed Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the pieces are together, its more of a case of operating, so having an operating guy as the CEO makes sense.&quot;</p>
<p>The major reshuffling of the industry is complete, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;You always want some vision but looking forward, operating skills will be more in demand,&quot; von Rumohr said.  </p>
<p>And considering the company's new CEO comes from its own top ranks, von Rumohr said the change may not have a dramatic effect on the company.</p>
<p>&quot;When you change people's titles, how much does that really change the way things get done? It's tough to tell.&quot;</p>
<p>Paul Nesbit, analyst with JSA Research Inc, agreed with Fourteen Research analyst Anthony Ginsberg that the company's depth of top management will help provide a smooth transition.</p>
