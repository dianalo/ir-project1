<p>AMR Corp's American Airlines is still likely to find a European suitor even its partnership with British Airways is blocked by a stalemate in the &quot;open skies&quot; talks between the U.S. and Britain, analysts said.</p>
<p>But many industry experts described the latest move by the United States to cancel this week's &quot;open skies&quot; talks as political posturing and not the final word on drafting a new aviation agreement between the two countries.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's more of a jawboning type of thing. It was more to do with the U.S.'s policy with Britain than anything to do with specific companies,&quot; said Dick Henderson, an airline analyst with the Pershing Division of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
<p>The U.S. said approval of the proposed alliance between American Airlines and British Airways Plc is contingent on first securing an open skies pact, giving U.S. carriers access to London's Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>Even if the U.S. and the U.K. did abandon efforts to free up transatlantic competition, American Airlines would find other willing partners, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The alliance would benefit them (American), of course. But without it, things are no worse off than they were before,&quot; said Glenn Engel, an airline analyst with Goldman Sachs. &quot;Things wouldn't change for American.&quot;</p>
<p>American will consider all other major European carriers, with Air France being the most logical partner, Engel said.</p>
<p>The Fort Worth-based airline previously said it would seek to reopen talks with Air France if the proposed alliance with British Airways is blocked.  </p>
<p>The Anglo-U.S. talks have hit some major stumbling blocks, such as expanded access for U.S. companies to London's Heathrow Airport and so-called &quot;fifth freedom&quot; rights, which would allow U.S. carriers to use Britain as a stopover for flights between the U.S. and third countries.</p>
<p>France and other European countries could easily satisfy American's need for fifth freedom rights, analysts said.</p>
<p>The proposed alliance, meanwhile, may not be as crucial for British Airways, which already holds a stake in USAir Group Inc .  </p>
<p>&quot;The U.K. has got to figure out what's in it for them,&quot; said David Stempler, president of Airtrav Advisers, an airline travel consulting firm.</p>
<p>Britain &quot;needs to see what they will gain from this, when the the U.S. is vying for 'fifth freedom' rights. They don't feel they have an equivalent position,&quot; Stempler said.</p>
<p>American Airlines and British Airways both said they expect the two countries will eventually develop a new aviation agreement. AMR Corp's stock held steady at 86-3/8, while British Airways' stock dropped on the news that the open skies talks were canceled.</p>
