<title>UK: IPE Brent down slightly in thin, rangebound market.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent down slightly in thin, rangebound market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent futures hovered just below Thursday's closing levels due to thin conditions and closing weaknesses on NYMEX, brokers said.</p>
<p>March Brent was trading five cents down at $22.37 a barrel, while Feb gas oil was $5.25 lower at $202.75 a tonne at 1320 GMT.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was lethargic, trading in a narrow range with thin volume.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of support at $22.30/35 and everyone seems to be playing the same range. There's nothing fundamental going on, it's all technical at the moment,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Some brokers said the NYMEX opening in the afternoon could exert further downward pressure on the contracts, but said any moves would remain rangebound between $22.29/31 and $22.94.</p>
<p>&quot;The weak close on New York, premiums on the physical material coming under pressure and a quiet market have led to prices easing down in thin conditions,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the bearish sentiment of the last few days had returned and any of Thursday's gains on the back of the week's bullish U.S. stocks data had now been priced in.</p>
<p>March Brent rose sharply in early trading on Thursday but failed to fill an upside gap at $22.94 and closed lower on the day, deepening those losses at Friday's open.</p>
<p>Gas oil was seen nearing the psychological $200 level.</p>
