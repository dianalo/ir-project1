<title>JAPAN: Minor Metals-Cobalt prices seen on decline in Asia.</title>
<headline>Minor Metals-Cobalt prices seen on decline in Asia.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-06-24</dateline>

<p>Cobalt prices will continue to ease in Asia, despite uncertainty about when the U.S. Defence Logistics Agency will resume sales of its stockpile, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese users have run out of stocks, but because they expect prices to ease further, they are buying only for immediate use,&quot; said a trader at a trading house.</p>
<p>Traders said cobalt prices dropped further in a move seen instigated by some traders after Laurent Kabila took power in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire. High-grade metal was quoted at $21-23 per pound and low-grade cobalt at $18-19.</p>
<p>Another cobalt trader at one of Japan's major trading houses said plenty of Russian offers were also weighing on the market, as well as the resumption of spot sales of high-grade cobalt by Canada's Falconbridge Ltd.</p>
<p>The price of Chinese bismuth has softened in the past week, traders in Shanghai said, quoting cost and freight (C&amp;F) prices in Rotterdam for Chinese material at $3.70/3.80 per lb.</p>
<p>&quot;That's still pretty high, but there are no takers,&quot; a trader in Shanghai said.</p>
<p>The recent bismuth price rises had preceded the summer slowdown, the traders said, and they did not expect business to pick up until after the holiday period.</p>
<p>Some Chinese producers were said to be boosting production in the hope of demand surges after the Northern Hemisphere comes back from vacation, some sources said.</p>
<p>Chinese indium producers were asking $300-305 a kg, but prices were being pressured by much lower offers for Russian material, a Hong Kong source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The price is coming under some pressure from Russian material which is coming out, and offers are quite low -- the last I heard was $210/220, which is much lower than the Chinese price,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Antimony prices were also under pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>One Hong Kong trader said her customers in Europe wanted to pay no more than $2,000 per tonne, C&amp;F Rotterdam, for Chinese material. Chinese producers were offering $2,000 C&amp;F Hong Kong, she said.</p>
<p>The molybdenum spot market was quiet, with many players waiting to see if U.S. Molycorp would start deliveries in July as expected. It was quoted at $4.50-4.60 per pound.</p>
<p>In the magnesium market, players were waiting for a new technology known as thixo-molding to be evaluated. It is an alternative to die-casting which allows magnesium to be shaped without using strong heat to melt the metal.</p>
<p>Chinese special high-grade magnesium was quoted at $2,350-2,450 per tonne, little changed from the previous week.</p>
