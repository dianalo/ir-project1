<title>USA: Dow industrials firm, Nasdaq waffles.</title>

<p>U.S. blue chips were buoyant on Friday following the release of U.S. unemployment data which gave conflicting signals about labor market strength, but Nasdaq was mixed after yesterday's strong showing.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 36 points or 0.49 percent at 7341, slightly off its session highs. Nasdaq was shifting between minute gains and losses, up 0.17 at 1390.</p>
<p>The long bond was off 7/32 at a 6.90 percent yield.  It dipped after the Labor Department reported a decline in the May jobless rate to 4.8 percent versus a forecast five percent, with a lower-than expected 138,000 new jobs added.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the Dow is going up because of the data's mixed signals,&quot; Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Kemper Funds, said. &quot;Unemployment was down to 4.8 percent, which is an alarming and negative rate, but the economy only added 138,000 new jobs, while the consensus was for 225,000.&quot;</p>
<p>The lack of consensus about the data created a small rally in blue chips, he said. Breadth on both the New York and Nasdaq stock markets was almost evenly mixed.</p>
<p>Nasdaq drifted as small-capitalization and technology issues took a rest after rebounding on Thursday, said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co.</p>
