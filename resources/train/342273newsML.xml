<headline>Abbey up as brokers repeat &quot;buy&quot; advice.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Abbey National Plc held onto early gains on Wednesday helped by analysts at Merrill Lynch and UBS as they repeated &quot;buy&quot; advice on the stock.</p>
<p>The shares were up 10-1/2p at 754p by 0925 GMT</p>
<p>UBS analyst John Aitken said he had been positive on the stock for a few months but had reiterated his stance after the shares had weakened recently.</p>
<p>&quot;The results today from the Northern Rock building society showed that the mortgage market is pretty buoyant,&quot; Aitken said. &quot;So this setback seems a reasonable opportunity to give the shares another push.&quot;  </p>
<p>Aitken rates the shares a &quot;buy&quot; and has a price target of between 820-850p.</p>
<p>At Merrill Lynch, analyst Richard Coleman said he had repeated an &quot;accumulate&quot; rating on the shares after edging his profit forecasts for the banking group up by around one percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock has been relatively weak against the sector in the last month or so,&quot; Coleman said. &quot;It seems worth looking at again.&quot;</p>
<p>The positive comments came after the shares have fallen 10 percent from highs to be trading at a discount to the rest of the sector.  </p>
<p>Earlier, the Northern Rock Building Society said that net lending for the year rose 44 percent to 1.9 billion stg whilst its share in the UK net mortgage lending market rose to 10 percent from eight percent before. Pretax profits were up 14 percent.</p>
<p>Panmure Gordon analyst David Poutney said he had also reaffirmed his &quot;strong buy&quot; rating on Abbey.</p>
