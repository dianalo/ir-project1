<p>Asia Pacific finance ministers back proposals by top private financiers to help attract more than $1 trillion for development, but will move at their own pace in adopting them, key officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a consensus that the idea of opening up, liberalisation, private sector participation is the way to go,&quot; Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, chairman of a meeting here of top financial officials of the 18-member APEC, told reporters.</p>
<p>But, he added: &quot;Nobody is forcing anybody to do it along any particular timing. Everybody has his own timing and it is recognised by everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin told reporters that differences reflected the fact that member economies were at varying stages of development.</p>
<p>Finance ministers' meetings were upbeat, however, he said. &quot;There was a general feeling we're going beyond the principle and that it really is time for action.&quot;</p>
<p>In a media briefing earlier on Saturday, the advisory group of APEC member private financiers listed a series of concrete steps they wanted governments to take--from establishment of regional information centres on financing needs to creation of bond rating agencies.</p>
<p>The aim: to attract an estimated $1.5 trillion developing economies of the region will need in the next decade to build telecommunication links, roads and other infrastructure vital to a modern economy.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no point for any economy to start talking about being a tiger economy when the growl of the tiger cannot be heard because it would take 10 calls between two telephone companies,&quot; said Johnny Ravalo, chief economist of the Bankers Association of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Many of the financiers' recommendations involved steps to promote development of fully-fledged capital markets throughout the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The development of domestic bond markets is viewed as essential,&quot; the financiers said. &quot;This voluntary initiative must be treated as a priority.&quot;</p>
<p>The financiers also complained of the treatment global bank regulators accord developing country debt.</p>
<p>Those regulations -- which determine how much and what type of capital banks must set aside to cover their loans -- mean that the cost of capital for developing country borrowers is five times more than for their industrial country counterparts, Ravalo said.</p>
<p>Among the financiers' other recommendations: cross listing of securities on various stock markets and standardization of accounting principles that companies must follow.</p>
<p>APEC finance ministers are due to issue a statement on Sunday outlining what they have agreed on in the key areas of their two days of discussions at a luxury resort hotel here.</p>
<p>Aside from comments on capital flow enhancement measures and market liberalisation, the statement will say major currency misalignments, as noted by the Group of Seven nations, have been corrected, Japanese delegation officials said.</p>
<p>They said such a reference would be the first of its kind adopted by APEC finance ministers. &quot;Asian economies are a large enough part of the world that there should be a common understanding on exchange rates,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>APEC, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</p>
