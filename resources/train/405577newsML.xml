<p>Time-bombs planted on buses killed at least four to five people in the capital of China's mainly Moslem region of Xinjiang on the day of memorials for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, an official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials and residents in the city of Urumqi said at least 60 people were wounded by three blasts on Tuesday which shattered the calm prevailing in China since the death of paramount leader Deng a week ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I think at least four to five people were killed, including one child who died instantly,&quot; said a television station official, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The blasts came within five minutes of each other in separate parts of the city, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are full of fear, and the city is on high alert,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was the first violence reported in restive Xinjiang since anti-Chinese riots in the region's town of Yining on February 5 and 6 left nine people dead and 198 wounded.</p>
<p>Chinese police arrested up to 300 people after that riot in Xinjiang, a region that Moslem separatists call East Turkestan.</p>
<p>The official said one of the bombs on Tuesday was on a bus in the city centre, and a second was on a bus that had passed by the radio station.</p>
<p>The bombs exploded around 6.40 p.m. (1040 GMT), he said.</p>
<p>&quot;People in Urumqi usually finish work at seven, so not too many people were injured or killed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is done by 'splittists',&quot; said the official, referring to Moslem separatists from the region's ethnic Uighur population.</p>
<p>&quot;Police have tightened up security in Yining, so they (the separatists) come here,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not have a good new year this year, we dare not to go out now. It is not stable here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said it would be difficult to catch the culprits.</p>
<p>&quot;They simply planted the bombs and left. Where can they be caught?&quot;</p>
<p>In an earlier account of the bombings, a city resident said a trishaw driver was killed when a bus passenger found a bomb under a seat and threw it out of the window.</p>
<p>The blasts occurred as final memorial rites were held in the Chinese capital Beijing for patriarch Deng, who died last Wednesday aged 92.</p>
<p>Xinjiang, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mostly Moslem Central Asian states, was shaken last year by bombings and attacks on officials and Moslem leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.</p>
