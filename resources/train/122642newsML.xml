<headline>US credit agencies shrug off Russia's Lebed firing.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The two largest U.S. credit rating agencies shrugged off news that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had fired his security chief, Alexander Lebed, noting that a certain amount of political upheaval is already built into their assessments of Russian debt.</p>
<p>&quot;If something like that would affect our rating, then our rating would be worth nothing,&quot; said Helena Hessel, director of Standard &amp; Poor's sovereign ratings group.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our rating is not based on whether Lebed is security chief or not,&quot; she noted, adding that it would stand through the worst case scenarios of Yeltsin's death and/or the rise of Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.</p>
<p>Hessel's counterpart at Moody's Investors Service Inc agreed. &quot;Russia's rating is brand new and was certainly put on to take into account any expectations of more political changes or jockeying,&quot; said David Levy, managing director of Moody's sovereign risk unit.</p>
<p>&quot;This is nothing terribly unexpected, and it is already incorporated into the rating,&quot; Levy said.  </p>
<p>In a rare live television appearance earlier Thursday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin sacked Lebed, who had served only four months in office. Yeltsin said he could no longer tolerate Lebed's lack of team spirit and alleged ambition to succeed him as Russia's leader.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P analyst conceded the rating is vulnerable to longer-term effects of political instability or a chain of negative events. The election of Zyuganov would not represent a complete reversal of Russia's &quot;situation&quot; she said, but it would prompt a negative reaction.  </p>
<p>In a conference call last week, Hessel said a short period of stress in Russia would not affect the country's debt service ability or lead S&amp;P to cut the debt rating.</p>
<p>But prolonged stress between Russia and the International Monetary Fund could force a ratings cut, she said.</p>
<p>An election of Zyuganov, while unlikely, would not automatically lead to abandonment by the IMF, she said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said its BB-minus foreign currency debt rating was based on strong support from international organizations and its debt restructuring. The country's &quot;manageable&quot; external debt profile helped boost the credit rating, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>Moody's issued a prospective Ba2 sovereign ceiling on the foreign currency debt, which will apply to Russia's upcoming Eurobond offering, Levy said.</p>
