<p>Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky resigned on Saturday after almost 11 years in power and said he would be succeeded by Finance Minister Viktor Klima.</p>
<p>Asked if he had submitted his resignation during a two-hour emergency meeting of senior members of his Social Democratic Party, Vranitzky told Reuters: &quot;Of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to a crowd of reporters later, Vranitzky, looking relaxed, said: &quot;Finance Minister Klima on my proposal has been designated as federal chancellor.&quot;</p>
<p>Vranitzky, 59, Europe's second longest-serving leader after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hinted he had become tired with politics and wanted to withdraw completely from the political scene.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought that after so many years it would be a wise decision to transfer responsibility to younger people in the party. My friends in the (party leadership) have accepted, with some hesitation, but they accepted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vranitzky took over the government in June 1986 and his Social Democrats have ruled in an uneasy coalition for most of the succeeding years with the conservative People's Party led by Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.</p>
<p>&quot;It was important to me to hand over my job at a time when the country is not burdened by a (political) crisis and where we are moving in a very positive direction in terms of Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government coalition survived a precarious crisis last weekend when Klima wrapped up the sale of flagship bank Creditanstalt to rival Bank Austria against strong opposition from the conservatives.</p>
<p>Vranitzky said he had no plans to take up any other political post, including that of Austrian president or at the European Commission. &quot;I have said on several occasions that I do not intend to take up such positions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He declined to specify when he made his decision to step down, but said his surprise move was not a response to the Social Democrats' poor showing in last October's European parliament elections.</p>
<p>&quot;I was disappointed, yes, but that has nothing to do with today's meeting. This is a good time to hand over my post,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to tell you it is not easy to leave,&quot; he said in his parting shot to dozens of reporters and camera teams before being driven off in a limousine. &quot;I have done my job. I've given my all.&quot;</p>
