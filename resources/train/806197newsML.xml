<p>A British actor playing Judas in a Greek hotel's production of the musical Jesus Christ Superstar accidentally hanged himself in front of hundreds of spectators, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said Antony Wheeler, 26, who was working as an entertainer at the Sani Beach Hotel on the northern Greek Chalkidiki peninsula, choked to death on Sunday night as more than 600 guests watched the show.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know how it happened. He had worked for us for three years. He was a pleasant, hard-working person and popular with his colleagues,&quot; hotel manager Dimitris Hatziyannakis told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Wheeler was supposed to suspend himself from a scaffold on the stage of an open-air theatre in the hotel grounds and free himself safely when the lights were out, said Hatziyannakis.</p>
<p>But the audience and his colleagues were shocked to see his body hanging in the air at the start of the next act.</p>
<p>A coroner's report would be issued on Tuesday morning, Hatziyannakis said.</p>
