<p>U.S. cruise operator Carnival Corporation on Thursday took delivery of the world's biggest ocean liner and said it planned a big expansion into the lucrative Asian market.</p>
<p>Carnival's chief executive Micky Arison and other company officials outlined plans to reporters at the official launch in Venice of the Carnival Destiny, which weighs 101,000 gross tons and looms taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>The $400 million ship, moored in the lagoon about 300 metres (yards) from Saint Mark's Square, dwarfed the occasional passing canal taxi.</p>
<p>Lin Arison, wife of the founder of Carnival Corp, named the vessel and smashed a magnum of champagne against the hull. But city authorities refused permission for the scheduled sounding of the ship's horn because of noise regulations.</p>
<p>Bob Dickinson, president of Carnival Cruise Lines, said at the naming ceremony: &quot;The launching of this ship shows our confidence in the industry's future, our confidence in our goal of carrying over 1.4 million passengers in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>The liner, described by its owners as a floating &quot;fun palace&quot;, will set sail for Boston on Friday morning, then go on to New York and Miami, from where it will embark on its maiden cruise around the Caribbean on November 24.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question this new ship will be a great success. Bookings are already excellent for its maiden cruise in the Caribbean in November,&quot; Micky Arison said in an interview on board the ship.</p>
<p>The cruise ship was built in just 20 months by Italy's state shipbuilder Fincantieri at its dockyard in the northeastern port of Trieste. It can accommodate 3,400 passengers on 12 passenger decks as well as 1,000 crew.</p>
<p>It has a three-deck high theatre that can seat 1,500, the largest casino afloat, four swimming pools and seven restaurants and cafes. Nearly two-thirds of all cabins have ocean views.</p>
<p>Arison said the cruise line business was on track to post record results again this year after the company reported net income of $268.1 million for the third quarter ended August 31 1996, up from $209.5 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the market globalising, cruising everywhere with passengers from everywhere, from the primary North American market to Europe and the Far East,&quot; said Arison.</p>
<p>The company's most recent joint venture is with South Korea's Hyundai business conglomerate and it plans to start operating cruises in Asia in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;The Asian market, particularly the western part of the Pacific rim is virtually an untapped market. There are very few players there and the Australian market has not been tapped at all. We are aiming for a larger share here,&quot; Dickinson said.</p>
<p>The deal with Hyundai involved selling Carnival's Tropical cruise liner to a new joint company Carnival Hyundai, in which each partner would hold a half share.</p>
<p>Arison said Carnival had not yet decided whether the new company would acquire a new fleet of ships or use existing vessels for the planned Asian expansion.</p>
