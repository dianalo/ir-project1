<headline>Gemina to hive off industrial interests.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1996-10-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italian industrial and financial holding company Gemina  said on Friday it is to hive off its industrial interests into a new company called Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali HPI Spa.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement that all existing Gemina shareholders would receive nine shares in the new company HPI for every 10 Gemina shares held.</p>
<p>Following the hiving off, Gemina's net equity would fall to 230 billion lire from 2.305 trillion. HPI would have net equity of 2.075 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Gemina said its direct and indirect holdings in the following companies would be hived off into HPI:</p>
<p>Gemina Participations, RCS Editori, Fila, GFT, Cartiere Burgo, Pirelli &amp; C, SMI, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Credito Italiano, Compagnie Monegasque de Banque and Istituto Europeo di Oncologia.</p>
<p>HPI would have reserves of 731 billion lire and liquid assets of 964 billion lire at the consolidated level.</p>
<p>Paid up company capital would total 1.343 trillion lire, divided into 2,573.87 mln ordinary shares and 112.883 million savings shares.  </p>
<p>Gemina said a stock exchange listing would be sought for the new HPI shares but did not say when the split off would come into effect.</p>
<p>The company said the decision to hive off industrial assets into HPI was a &quot;strategic choice of considerable importance&quot; which would allow industrial and financial assets to be managed separately.</p>
<p>Gemina would manage a portfolio made up of Gemina Immobiliare, Gemina Capital Markets, Gemina Europe Bank, Banca di Credito e Commercio as well as other minority stakes including Fineurop Group.</p>
<p>The statement said newspaper and publishing group RCS, which disclosed heavy losses last year, showed continuing signs of improvement at the operating level.</p>
<p>The GFT textiles group was expected to show a further improvement in net results for the full year while sportswear group Fila was continuing to show rapid sales and profits growth.</p>
