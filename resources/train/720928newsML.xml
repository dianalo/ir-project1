<p>Australian retailer Woolworths Ltd reported a return to double-digit quarterly sales growth on Thursday, outperforming its expectations to post annual sales growth of 9.25 percent.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Reg Clairs said the result, built on a progressive improvement throughout the year, was gratifying and showed some slight return of consumer confidence.</p>
<p>Woolworths three months ago was forecasting annual sales growth of about 8.5 percent.  </p>
<p>Woolworths earlier reported its sales rose to A$15.57 billion in the 53 weeks ended June 29 from A$13.99 billion in the 52 weeks ended June 23, an unadjusted increase of 11.36 percent or 9.25 percent adjusted to a 52-week basis.</p>
<p>On a &quot;like-for-like&quot; basis, which excludes the impact of new stores, the sales increase over a 52-week period was 4.39 percent, Woolworths said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there's an inflation rate of around 1.5 to 2.0 percent, to have achieved 4.4 percent is a particularly pleasing result and it does reflect that there is the slightest element of an improvement in consumer confidence,&quot; Clairs told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Adjusting for the early Easter and excluding the additional week of trading gave quarterly sales rises of 8.2 percent, 8.9 percent, 9.2 percent and 10.8 percent, Clairs said.</p>
<p>&quot;So it's back to double digits again,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just progressively got stronger.&quot;</p>
<p>Woolworths enjoyed double-digit growth for most of the 1990s, but sales started to slow in 1995/96 as Australia's inflation rate fell and the retail environment became tougher.</p>
<p>Clairs said supermarket sales had benefited from new store openings, a full year's trading from the purchase of stores in Canberra, and retail petrol and wholesaling initiatives.  </p>
<p>Woolworths has started selling petrol at some of its supermarkets and plans to open one new site a week for the next three years, eventually establishing about 200 sites by 2000. However, the Sydney-based retailer has only 12 retail petrol sites at present, and Clairs said the operations had not made a a significant contribution to sales.</p>
<p>Clairs said the second initiative, the Australian Independent Wholesalers (AIW) wholesaling arm, was building market share in Queensland and would open in Victoria in several weeks.  </p>
<p>Woolworths hoped AIW would break even in about a year's time, he said.</p>
<p>Both petrol sales and wholesaling would be broken out from the supermarkets division next year.</p>
<p>Total food sales for 1996/97 rose 9.23 percent on a 52-week basis to A$13.35 billion, general merchandise sales were up 10.29 percent at A$1.82 billion, and specialty retail was up 5.54 percent at A$396 million.</p>
<p>Clairs said general merchandise sales were driven by the Big W group, which opened some new stores and pursued a strong marketing campaign.  </p>
<p>There seemed to be &quot;a little degree&quot; of consumer confidence returning to discretionary spending, reflecting official interest rate cuts, he said.</p>
<p>But he declined to comment on interest rate policy.</p>
