<headline>Paramount vice chairman to resign.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES</dateline>
<text>
<p>Paramount Pictures Monday said Vice Chairman Barry London has decided to resign.</p>
<p>The studio, which is owned by Viacom Inc., said London will remain in his current position until a successor is named, after which he will enter into a production deal with Paramount Pictures.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, London said the move was &quot;totally my decision&quot; and not the result of a shake-up at the studio.</p>
<p>&quot;It's something that I've been toying with for a number of years and I think at this stage in my life I've very much excited about the challenge of being a producer on this lot,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he hoped to assume his role as producer by the end of the year but there was no specific timetable for his departure.</p>
<p>As vice chairman of the motion pictures group, London was responsible for the studio's theatrical and video marketing and distribution of motion pictures on a worldwide basis.</p>
<p>During his tenure, London supervised the release of some of the studio's biggest hits, including &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;.</p>
<p>He became vice chairman of the Motion Picture Group in October of 1994.</p>
