<p>Front month naphtha swaps fell back by another $1.50 Tuesday despite stable to higher crude futures values as physical market sentiments continued to weaken slightly, European dealers said.</p>
<p>The August decline to $184.50-$185.50 by late afternoon, having been traded around lunchtime at $185, contrasted with trader open spec physical naphtha bidding at $190 CIF NWE and offers at $191 and $192.50, levels seen by several dealers as beyond the reach of end-users in particular.</p>
<p>The physical talk on a fairly quiet day of trading was in line with the $191 deal of Monday but still above end-Tuesday published quotes in the $186-$190 CIF NWE range.</p>
<p>A UK-based major said it had Tuesday bought an approximately 10,000 tonne lot on private and confidential terms amid rumors of an ARA player seeking to offload 10,000-15,000 tonnes of naphtha.</p>
<p>Traders said crude and naphtha's own fundamentals were likely to translate into further near-term weakening for naphtha, although one broker said large cargoes were still very difficult to locate.</p>
<p>A September swap trade was earlier heard done at $183, as brokers bagan to place September and October at $182.50-$183.50 parity by late afternoon.</p>
