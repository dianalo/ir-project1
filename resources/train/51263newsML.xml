<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has promoted Alfred Kokh, a young economist, to head the State Property Committee, Russia's privatisation ministry.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the committee said Kokh's appointment had taken effect on Thursday, filling a post left vacant when Chernomyrdin announced his cabinet last month.</p>
<p>Kokh, 35, already first deputy head of the committee, had been acting chairman from August 1995 to January this year.</p>
<p>Kokh's predecessor, Alexander Kazakov, was removed in July to become first deputy head of the presidential administration. Yeltsin's chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais, also once headed the property committee.</p>
<p>Kokh played a leading role in the controversial shares-for- loans programme promoted by Chubais last year, in which state-owned stakes in major privatised companies were transferred to Russian banks in exchange for loans to the government.</p>
