<p>NATIONAL STOPWORK AT COMMONWEALTH BANK</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank workers are being assured their jobs are safe, under plans for a new enterprise bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>Members of the Finance Sector Union are holding stop-work meetings across the nation today, claiming the bank is threatening rights to days-off, redundancy, sick leave and career options.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's Corporate Relations Manager Lyndell Fraser, says the bank wants to ensure the future of staff.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly the union's action doesn't help the negotiation process,&quot; Ms Fraser said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we remain committed to it.  We're about getting fair remuneration for our staff and getting on with keeping them in jobs. That way we serve customers and make a contribution to the whole economy,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ms Fraser says the bank expects some branches to be closed this morning but electronic banking won't be affected.</p>
<p>She says a hotline and a customer service line, 132221, will be staffed to answer customer queries this morning.</p>

<p>SAUDI CASE IN DEATH OF AUSSIE NURSE ADJOURNED</p>
<p>The trial of two British nurses accused of killing an Australian colleague in Saudi Arabia has been adjourned for two weeks.</p>
<p>The defendants were not in the Islamic court for the brief hearing, which was attended by a British consul and legal representatives for the accused and the family of victim Yvonne Gilford.</p>
<p>A British diplomatic source said the court in the eastern city of Khobar asked for further clarification of the legal position of the victim's family.</p>
<p>The defence has questioned the right of Yvonne Gilford's brother, Frank, to decide whether to grant mercy if nurses Lucille McLauchlan and Deborah Parry are found guilty of murder and sentenced to be beheaded.</p>
<p>Under Islamic law, the victim's family has the right to spare the lives of a relative's killers and accept a financial settlement instead.</p>

<p>Marketing Manager Adriane Baker says the new developments have been necessary.</p>
<p>She says the village development and ski slope plan provide opportunities to put the ski industry in the state, and particulrly Perisher, into the next millenium.</p>

<p>CHARGES OVER BLACK HAWK TRAGEDY DIFFICULT</p>
<p>The Australian Defence Force will receive advice this week on whether charges should be laid against three officers involved in the Black Hawk tragedy.</p>
<p>Eighteen servicemen were killed last year in the Army's worst peacetime disaster when two helicopters collided during an exercise near Townsville in North Queensland.</p>
<p>The advice is likely to indicate difficulties in laying charges because of problems in collecting evidence.</p>
<p>Evidence given at the Black Hawk Board of Inquiry can't be used in a disciplary hearing.</p>
<p>The board recommended a convening authority investigate whether or not charges should be laid under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</p>
<p>An investigator, appointed by the authority, has spent months collecting evidence.</p>
<p>It's understood when he visited Perth to interview troopers from the Special Air Service, around 20 of them opted not to answer questions.</p>
<p>The SAS men cited a Defence Force Discipline Act clause which allows them that right.</p>
<p>As well, key figures in the crash have indicated they will appear for the defence, not the Defence Force.</p>
<p>Land commander Major General Frank Hickling will receive a report and decide if charges will laid.</p>

<p>TOURIST RAPED ON GOLD COAST BEACH</p>
<p>A 14-year-old Swedish tourist has been raped on the beach at Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast.</p>
<p>Police say the girl was with 31 other students on a supervised visit to Australia.</p>
<p>She and a friend left the group's accomodation without permission on Saturday night and went to Surfers Paradise.</p>
<p>When one girl left to find a toilet, the other was approached and raped by a man.</p>
<p>She and her friend returned to the tour group at a Biggera Waters caravan park and reported the attack.</p>
<p>Police say the students have left the coast and are due to fly out of Sydney tomorrow.</p>

<p>LABOR ON THE ATTACK OVER STATUS OF WOMEN</p>
<p>The Federal Opposition has called for a 10-point-plan to protect Australian women from discriminatory practices.</p>
<p>Labor said the government has been humiliated by the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which said policies on child-care, housing and employment have harmed women's positions in Australia.</p>
<p>The chair of Labor's Committee on the Status of Women, Margaret Reynolds, has proposed a 10-point-plan which would put into effect the UN's recommendations.</p>
<p>Senator Reynolds said the government cannot pretend it is committed to women's rights, when it is so clearly dismantling women's programs.</p>
<p>&quot;Now either they've got to be honest and go to the UN and say look we don't believe in this elimination of discrimination against women, we're going to revoke our signatory of that convention; or they have to practise what they preach,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Senator Reynolds said the UN holds serious concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;They're concerned about the dismantling of the women's budget program and the national register of women, and I think they feel this government does not really understand the processes that they have committed themselves to in terms of their obligations under the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of discrimination.&quot;</p>
