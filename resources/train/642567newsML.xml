<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK shares ended sharply higher on Friday as continued takeover bid speculation overshadowed the reality of increased British interest rates and the threat of a U.S. fiscal tightening. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares, which started the week at 4,621.3, closed at 4,645.0, up 68.8 points on the day. This was up 23.7 from last Friday.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares end bourse trade up but off the new record high in DAX reached as index climbed above 3,700 points. Firmer dollar and overnight Wall Street gains underpin market. Market awaits U.S. May jobless data at 1230 GMT. The 30-share DAX ended up 22.26 points at 3,695.29. This was up 147.45 on the week. In post-bourse trade the index stood at 3,700.53 up 15.93.</p>
<p>PARIS - Ignoring political uncertainty, French shares finished higher for the sixth straight trading day, helped by a strong Wall Street performance. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed near its intrasession high, finishing up 1.06 percent or 28.40 points at 2,719.25 a rise of 135.31 from last week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares kept this week's record-setting pace, posting a fourth straight record close on the back of a soaring U.S. dollar, derivatives-linked buying, and a host of rumours in the financial sector. The All share SPI closed up 40.54 points at 3,368.53 up 172.97 since last Friday.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended steady on Friday, as investors were cautious ahead of U.S. payroll data to be released later in the day and squared positions ahead of the weekend, brokers said. They added that although blue-chips were lacklustre, there was interest in laggard issues. The 225-share Nikkei average closed down 2.40 points or 0.01 percent at 20,485.75 up 416.94 from last Friday.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Friday ahead of the long weekend, unsettled by placement rumours and a ban on equity investment by Chinese banks, despite Hongkong Telecom's record setting jump, brokers said. The Hang Seng Index closed 140.39 points lower at 14,655.13 a drop of 102.68 on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian stock market held its head just above the 2,600 mark on Friday in a day dominated by the placement of A$1.54 billion (US$1.2 billion) of Foster's Brewing Group shares. The All Ordinaries Index firmed off its lows in afternoon trade to close down just 3.3 points at 2,600.9 a fall of 9.6 points from the previous Friday's close.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold stocks, virtually ignored in recent weeks, steal limelight on gains in bullion late on Friday hoisting the all-share index to a fresh record peak with Western Areas up almost 16 percent. All-share at 7,262.2, a gain of 43.7 points up 240.5 from a week ago. Industrial index up 6.8 to 8,476.7 a rise of 236.5 from last Friday and golds up 35.3 points, or 3.1 percent, to 1,175.6 a gain of 1.8 since last week.</p>
