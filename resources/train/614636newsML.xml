<p>At least 17 people have died as three days of torrential rains pummelled a wide area of the Philippines, flooding thousands of homes and bringing the capital Manila to a standstill, officials said on Monday. Six people drowned when their pleasure boat capsized off the central island of Cebu while 11 drowned in floods, were electrocuted or crushed to death by falling wa lls in Manila and nearby towns, they said. Financial markets in the capital closed as floodwaters as high as eight feet (1.5 metres) submerged low areas in the metropolis of 10 million people. The rains marked the end of a long dry season that had some parts of the country running short of water.</p>
<p>The rainy season usually begins around May and lasts until November, averaging more than 20 typhoons during the period.</p>
<p>Manila's stock market managed to stay open for only 15 minutes before officials closed it for the day. Banks in the capital had all but stopped trading.</p>
<p>Power was cut off in many parts of Manila in the morning. Thousands of workers were stranded as buses and cars were unable to drive through the often waist-deep water. The presidential palace ordered the closure of all government offices in the capital, including state-controlled companies. Several private offices also closed down. A three-foot (one metre) deep mudflow cascaded down river-beds , bringing down tonnes of volcanic rock and ash left over from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, said National Disaster Coordinating Council executive officer Fortunato Dejoras in a report to the president.</p>
<p>More than 2,500 homes were submerged by floods in two towns of Bataan province just north of Manila, relief officials said.</p>
<p>The Weather Bureau warned that the rains, the result of an active low pressure area hovering over Luzon island, would continue until Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Philipine Airlines cancelled all its domestic and international flights until midnight. Several international flights were delayed while two others were diverted to Mactan airport in the central Phililppines because of poor visibility.</p>
