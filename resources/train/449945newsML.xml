<p>Mexican building Grupo Tribasa will provide capital of some $37 million to finance its share of a concession to upgrade a highway in Chile, a company executive told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to provide (some) capital for the project, which is no problem. Tribasa will provide $37 million for the concessionary group by April 2,&quot; Tribasa's Vice-President of Finance Manuel Delgado said.</p>
<p>Delgado said work on the project would begin in August or September.  </p>
<p>The project, which will cost a total of $250 million, aims to upgrade a 170-kilometer stretch of the Panamerican highway in Chile and to operate it as a toll road for 22 years.</p>
<p>Chile's Public Works Ministry announced on Monday a group led by Tribasa had won the concession.</p>
<p>Delgado added the capital injection by Tribasa was part of a process to arrange a package to finance the highway project, which could also include bank loans.</p>
<p>Tribasa was not ruling out a bond issue, underwritten by Chilean pension funds, as part of the package.</p>
<p>Delgado said the advantage of Chilean highway concessions was that the government guaranteed minimum revenues, rather than a daily minimum average traffic flow, as was the case in Mexico.</p>
<p>Companies that were awarded toll road concessions in recent years in Mexico ran into financial trouble when traffic flow often turned out to be much lower than planned, and the government has subsequently restructured their outstanding bank loans.</p>
