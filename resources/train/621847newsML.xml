<headline>Quick Australian land settlement needed - Howard.</headline>
<dateline>CANBERRA 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard emphasised on Wednesday the need for an early settlement to the country's divisive struggle over Aboriginal land rights.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is important to investment stability in Australia that amendments to the native title act to render it workable are made as soon as possible,&quot; Howard told parliament.</p>
<p>Howard is trying to implement a policy that mediates between the conflicting demands of Aborigines, to whom the High Court last year granted greater land rights, and farmers and miners who say the extended native title is a threat to their industries.</p>
<p>The primary producers particularly complain that uncertainty over exactly what rights the Aborigines have, and will have after the policy is enacted, demands a quick response.</p>
<p>The policy -- which Howard has not described beyond a broad outline -- would limit but not entirely abolish the rights to share pastoral leases that the court gave Aborigines.</p>
<p>Howard is expected to publish draft legislation next month.</p>
<p>He says native rights would be restricted only as far as needed to protect primary production, with compensation paid to Aborigines, as the constitution requires.</p>
<p>Aboriginal groups, generally conceding that their rights need to be regulated in some way, say Howard has gone too far.</p>
<p>But many of the primary producers have demanded complete abolition of the native title rights, which would require even more compensation.</p>
