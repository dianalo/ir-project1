<title>THAILAND: Thai Farmers to raise Q1 loan provisions.</title>
<headline>Thai Farmers to raise Q1 loan provisions.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank Plc, Thailand third's largest commercial bank, decided on Thursday to raise its doubtful loans provision to 1.050 billion baht ($40.38 million) for the first quarter of 1997, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>That compared with a doubtful loans provision of 486 million baht for the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The information regarding the raising of the doubtful loans provision will be conveyed to the stock market later today,&quot; she told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The spokeswoman declined to say how much money the bank would set aside for doubtful loans provision for all of 1997.</p>
<p>She said during calendar 1996 the bank's total doubtful loans provision stood at 2.323 billion baht.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason for the bank to raise its doubtful loans provision during the first quarter this year is because the bank expects the country's economy this year to become worse than last year. The bank's borrowers would be in a more difficult position to settle debts,&quot; said the spokeswoman.</p>
<p>She said the bank was confident its decision to raise the doubtful loans provision would not affect its profit or stock investors.</p>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank was trading at 102 baht, down seven baht, by the lunch break on Thursday.</p>
