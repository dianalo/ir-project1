<p>In just two years, the eastern Caribbean island of Montserrat has gone from upmarket tourist destination, about to shed its British colonial ties, to a volcano-ravaged dependency whose inhabitants are preparing for mass evacuation.</p>
<p>The tiny tear-drop shaped island, measuring just 11 by seven miles (18 x 11 km), lived in harmony with its dormant Soufriere Hills volcano for nearly four centuries until the mountain began to belch ash and rock in July 1995.</p>
<p>Once rock music celebrities such as Paul McCartney, Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Police recorded at George Martin's hilltop Air Studios. But the studios were badly damaged by a 1989 hurricane and now lie buried in ash.</p>
<p>Tourists attracted by the island's lush valleys, sheer cliffs and black sand beaches -- and a mainstay of the economy -- have petered out.</p>
<p>The number of visitors plummeted 52 percent in 1996 from a level of 36,267 in 1994. In the first five months of this year, the flow had turned to a trickle of just over 3,000, local tourist officials said.</p>
<p>The island's farming belt has been decimated, with the heavy concentration of gases and ash causing plants to wither in the fields, and Montserrat is now dependent on aid from Britain, which has given more than 41 million pounds ($66 million) over the past year.</p>
<p>The volcano is the second natural disaster to hit the island in recent years. The 11,000 islanders had only just finished repairing the 90 percent of buildings damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, when the volcano roared back to life.</p>
<p>Now the population has shrunk to less than half and those who are left are crammed into the north of the island, away from the volcano which has already destroyed the capital, Plymouth.</p>
<p>Montserrat is one of Britain's few remaining colonies and is close to another, Anguilla, which is acting as temporary home to many of the islanders. Some have fled to other nearby islands such as Antigua whilst some have gone to Britain or the United States.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, independence was a major political issue for Monserratians, spearheaded by the People's Liberation Movement which won elections in 1978, 1983 and 1987.</p>
<p>But the bid for freedom has been postponed after the natural disasters and a series of scandals in the offshore banking sector in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The island was sighted and named by Christopher Columbus in 1493, on his second voyage to the Americas. He called it Santa Maria de Montserrat after the Abbey of Montserrat near Barcelona in Spain.</p>
<p>English and Irish settlers arrived in 1632, many of them Catholics fleeing religious persecution. Most of the population are now Anglicans or Methodists but the island is still know as &quot;the Emerald Isle&quot; in honour of its Irish heritage as well as its lush vegetation.</p>
<p>Slaves were brought to the island in the 17th century to grow tobacco, cotton and sugar, until the 19th century when slavery was abolished.</p>
<p>Joseph Sturge, a British philanthropist and reformer, played a major part in shaping the island's history, forming the Montserrat Company in 1857 which bought up the old estates and planted limes.</p>
<p>The current government is headed by the National Progressive Party, which was formed in the early 1990s, and is led by Bertrand Osborne.</p>
