<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed higher on increased local buying of blue chips on Tuesday after falling for two straight days on profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 6.8 points up at 862.5 despite price declines outnumbering gains by 40 to 29. Blue chips John Keells Holdings rose 9.75 rupees to 379.75 and Grain Elevators 1.50 rupees to 39.50.</p>
<p>Brokers said Tuesday's announcement that Japan's NTT had bought a 35 percent holding in Sri Lanka Telecom for $225 million, had little impact on the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;The news will have an impact on how foreigners look at Sri Lanka in the long-term, because it will mean that economically things are moving,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;Improved economic conditions are expected to benefit blue chips more than other stocks,&quot; said a broker at Asia Scruties.</p>
<p>&quot;Blue chips like John Keells, which have diversified into more strategic areas, are expected to do very well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Turnover was 117.18 million rupees due to heavy trading in blue chips, with over 100,000 shares of Development Finance, 20,000 Aitken Spence and 150,000 Sampath Bank traded. Foreign buying was 54.3 million rupes and selling was 71.1 million. -- Prithi Kodagoda (941) 434319</p>
