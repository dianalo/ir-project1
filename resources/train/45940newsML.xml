<title>RUSSIA: Russian T-bill yield falls on heavy demand.</title>
<headline>Russian T-bill yield falls on heavy demand.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Heavy demand at Wednesday's sales of government securities allowed the finance ministry to push down the yield at the Treasury bill auction and push up the price of government bonds, dealers said.</p>
<p>But some dealers said they believed major banks had bought heavily at the request of the authorities. At the same time, the recent stability of the rouble made Russian paper more attractive.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Krayev, a dealer from International Moscow Bank, said there was particularly strong demand from non-residents, while Russian operators were ready to buy at current market prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Taken that there were a lot of funds in the trading system, the finance ministry had a full guarantee of sales,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The average yield on the issue of six-month T-bills fell to 67.97 percent from 78.18 percent at the last auction of six-month paper a week ago.</p>
<p>The average price of an 18-month OFZ government bond rose to 95.25 percent from 89.04 percent at the last bond auction on July 31.</p>
<p>Investors' bids amounted to 11.86 trillion roubles for a 7.50 trillion rouble T-bill issue and 3.84 trillion roubles for a 3.50 trillion rouble government bond issue.</p>
<p>Krayev said the finance ministry sold half the T-bill issue to a single dealer, who put in &quot;a superstrong bid,&quot; and the rest was bought by non-residents.</p>
<p>Dealers said they believed the state savings bank Sberbank, a major player on the market, had been behind the single bid. There was no comment from Sberbank.</p>
<p>They estimated non-residents' investment in both today's auctions amounted to $400-$500 million.</p>
<p>German Kim, a dealer from Promradtekhbank, said the central bank must have given an order to several big banks to push the yields down.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's auctions were muscle flexing and a demonstration of tough intentions by the finance ministry and central bank,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>Dealers had forecast the average T-bill yield in the 68-80 percent range. &quot;Everyone was surprised by such a yield,&quot; Kim said. &quot;Everyone bid at 71, 72, 73 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>The average price and the lowest accepted price at the T-bill auction were at the same level of 71.22 percent, which Kim said represented extremely high demand and meant investors were taking great risks in guessing the cut-off price.</p>
<p>He forecast a price rise would set in at tomorrow's secondary trading with periodic profit-taking over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a panic price rise and by the end of the quarter prices will fall to 60-65 percent,&quot; Krayev said.</p>
<p>But he noted that high overnight credit rates -- 80 to 100 percent -- may prevent banks from heavy investment in government paper.</p>
<p>The authorities continued their recent policy of simply rolling over debt at the auction and not taking up fresh funds.</p>
<p>Total proceeds from the two auctions amounted to 7.49 trillion roubles. On Wednesday the finance ministry repaid 6.50 trillion roubles in a maturing six-month T-bill and paid 820 billion roubles in bond interest.</p>
