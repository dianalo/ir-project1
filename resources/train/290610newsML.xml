<title>BOSNIA: Arbitration hearing set for disputed Bosnian town.</title>
<headline>Arbitration hearing set for disputed Bosnian town.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1997-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bosnia's Serb and Moslem representatives plan their first arbitration session on Wednesday to try to settle a bitter dispute over control of the strategic town of Brcko, international envoys said.</p>
<p>Roberts Owen, a U.S. lawyer who serves as chairman of the arbitration panel, will preside over the three- to four-day session in Rome, said Colum Murphy, a spokesman for the office of the High Representative to Bosnia.</p>
<p>Similar attempts to begin international arbitration over Brcko have collapsed with the Bosnian Serb side refusing to attend meetings, but Murphy said the Serb delegation had promised to participate in the Rome meeting.</p>
<p>Brcko, a Sava river port connecting Serb-held territory to the west and east, is considered the most volatile flashpoint in Bosnia.</p>
<p>A peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war a year ago failed to resolve the future status of Brcko, which separatist Serb forces seized early in the 1992-1995 conflict after expelling the Moslem and Croat population.</p>
<p>This week's arbitration session occurs against a backdrop of increasingly tough rhetoric from rival Serb and Moslem leaders over the narrow Brcko corridor.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb leaders insist Brcko must remain under the control of the country's Serb republic and have warned they will go to war to protect what they consider a lifeline for Serb-held territory.</p>
<p>Moslem-Croat federation leaders have rejected the Serb threats and say their legal arguments -- based on the town's mixed pre-war population -- will prevail in the arbitration.</p>
<p>But Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem member of the Bosnian presidency, has said that if Serbs chose to resort to force, they would lose the battle because, he said, the Serbs no longer enjoy military superiority.</p>
<p>&quot;If it comes to a fight for Brcko, I think there is no doubt who would win that war,&quot; Izetbegovic told Bosnian state television recently.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we have no intention to announce any war...we believe that the law is on our side.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dayton peace treaty originally set December 14, 1996 as the deadline for resolving Brcko but the parties postponed the deadline until February 15.</p>
<p>The first session is supposed to give both sides a chance to present evidence to the arbitration panel made up of Owen, Cazim Sdikovic of the Moslem-Croat federation and Vitomir Popovic of the Serb republic.</p>
<p>Under the Dayton accords, Bosnia is preserved as a loose union divided into autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat territories.</p>
