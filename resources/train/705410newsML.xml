<p>An Indian cargo plane that went missing soon after take-off from a Bombay airport early on Thursday could have crashed into the sea, airline officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got some information and have sent a search party there to vet it. But nothing is confirmed as yet,&quot; said Sunil Rai, assistant vice-president of Elbee Airlines, 14 hours after the courier service's aircraft vanished off the radar screens.</p>
<p>The airplane could have gone into the sea near Madh Island, off the coast of the suburb of Malad, 45 km (28 miles) northwest of Bombay, Rai said, but airline officials were still checking.</p>
<p>The missing plane has not disrupted operations, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our schedules have always been operated on the basis of two planes,&quot; he said. &quot;It hasn't affected operations. We're more worried about our missing people.&quot;</p>
<p>The company owns three planes.</p>
<p>The Fokker Friendship (F-27), carrying two crewmen and cargo, took off in stormy weather for the southern city of Bangalore around 4 a.m. (1030 GMT Wednesday) but disappeared soon after, air traffic officials said.</p>
<p>Much of India is experiencing monsoon rains. The Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency, reporting the incident, quoted an airport official as saying &quot;the weather was bad and raining with low patches of clouds&quot;.</p>
