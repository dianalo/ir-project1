<p>The U.S. government will make it easier for Catholic pilgrims to travel to Cuba to see Pope John Paul II when he visits the Communist-ruled island in January, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Archdiocese of Miami, where many Cuban exiles live, has requested permission to sail a cruise ship across to Havana with hundreds of Catholics who want to see the pontiff when he visits Cuba for five days starting on Jan. 21.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at facilitating pilgrims who are going to see the pope,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. government views the pope's prospective visit as a potentially important act in bringing to the Cuban people a message of hope and the need for respect of human rights,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But the official stressed that there would be no change in U.S. restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba under the 34-year-old economic embargo against President Fidel Castro's government.</p>
<p>He said all license requests for travel to Cuba for the pope's visit will be considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with existing U.S. laws.</p>
<p>&quot;Facilitating can mean simply that, realizing the importance of the visit, we will move all these requests to the top of the list and pay careful attention to them to try to make as quick a turnaround as possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said a request by the Archdiocese of Miami to organize a pilgrimage on a cruise chip was being considered under the regulations of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control, which approves licenses on travel to Cuba.</p>
<p>The U.S. embargo imposed on Castro's Cuba by the Kennedy administration in 1963 bans all commerce with Cuba. It does not prohibit outright travel to the island by Americans, but bans them from spending U.S. money in Cuba.</p>
<p>The travel ban makes an exception for Cubans with close relatives on the island, journalists and other Americans who are involved in educational or religious exchanges.</p>
<p>The U.S. embargo was tightened last year with passage of the Helms-Burton Law, which seeks to discourage foreign investment in Cuba by punishing firms that use property confiscated after the Cuban revolution led by Castro.</p>
