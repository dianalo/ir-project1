<p>Australian stayer Saintly cruised to victory in the A$2.2 million ($1.74 million) Melbourne Cup on Tuesday, securing Bart Cummings' reputation as the greatest trainer in the country's horse racing history.</p>
<p>The four-year-old chestnut, an 8-1 chance, stayed close to the rail for most of the 3,200-metre (two-mile) race and sped from the field at the home turn to win by two-and-a-quarter lengths from 33-1 shot Count Chivas.</p>
<p>Skybeau, a 50-1 outsider, finished a neck further back in third place at Flemington.</p>
<p>Saintly clocked a time of three minutes 18.8 seconds, the sixth fastest in the race's 135-year history.</p>
<p>It was Cummings' 10th victory in Australia's most prestigious horse race, five more than his nearest rival in the training stakes.</p>
<p>But there was disappointment for giant Irish raider and 4-1 pre-race favourite Oscar Schindler, who failed to find any extra pace on the home straight and finished a disappointing 15th of 22 runners.</p>
<p>&quot;He just didn't fire,&quot; said jockey Michael Kinane of the Irish stallion, who had struck fear into his rivals with a fast-finishing third in last month's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. &quot;No sooner had I asked him than I knew he wouldn't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Cummings, who scored the first of his 10 Melbourne Cup wins in 1965 with Light Fingers and his last with Let's Elope five years ago, had faced questions before the race over Saintly's ability to stay the course.</p>
<p>Jockey Darren Beadman, who rode a textbook race on Saintly to win his second Melbourne Cup, praised Cummings in his post-race speech.</p>
<p>&quot;Bart Cummings is an absolute genius with a capital G,&quot; said Beadman, who won the race on Kingston Rule in 1990.</p>
<p>Not only did Cummings breed and train Saintly, but he owned and trained its sire, Sky Chase, as well. &quot;So this was a nice one to win,&quot; said the 68-year-old trainer, who confessed to having a tear in his eye as his charge sped home.</p>
<p>&quot;It's getting tougher each year. This is very special and I savour it very much,&quot; said Cummings, who is based at Randwick in Sydney but was a favourite with Tuesday's crowd of around 90,000 in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Saintly's Malaysian owner, Dato Tan Chin Nam, thanked Cummings for selling him a horse capable of winning the Melbourne Cup. Cummings had kept a share of the horse.</p>
<p>The two have collaborated before successfully, with Think Big, which won the Cup in 1974 and 1975 and was the last horse to win back-to-back.</p>
<p>&quot;What can you say about Saintly?&quot; asked Dato Tan. &quot;I can say in the Australian language -- Saintly, You Beaut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for Darren Beadman, if there is such a thing as a copybook ride, this was it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Cummings said Saintly would now go for &quot;a holiday in Japan&quot;, referring to the lucrative Japan Cup in Tokyo on November 24.</p>
<p>Kinane, who persuaded owner Oliver Lehane to bring Oscar Schindler to Melbourne instead of going for the more lucrative Breeders Cup Turf in Toronto, said the horse had appeared perfectly well settled before the race.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to take a stand and take a decision. We felt -- not just me but the trainer too -- that he was the right horse,&quot; said Kinane, who steered another Irish stayer, Vintage Crop, to victory three years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;At his very best you would have expected him to beat them,&quot; he added. (A$1=US$0.79)</p>
