<title>JORDAN: Jordan shares squeezed by lack of cash.</title>
<headline>Jordan shares squeezed by lack of cash.</headline>
<dateline>AMMAN 1997-03-23</dateline>

<p>Jordanian shares closed unchanged on Sunday as optimism over new trading contracts with Iraq was balanced by a cash squeeze on the Amman bourse, brokers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market (AFM) index slipped back from 153.87 points in mid-morning to close at 153.60 points, exactly the same as Saturday's close.</p>
<p>The growing number of outstanding certificates of deposit (CDs), issued by the Central Bank in place of treasury bills, has drained cash liquidity from the market and pushed banks to offer better interest rates than the return on most stocks, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the reasons which is pulling people out of the market,&quot; said Nasser al-Amad, head of United Financial Investments.</p>
<p>Lack of foreign investors over the Western weekend had also dampened the positive impact of news on Saturday that Jordanian firms had won clearance for sales of detergents to Iraq worth $26 million under a U.N. oil-for-food deal agreed in December.</p>
<p>Trading was dominated by banking shares which accounted for nearly half of Sunday's business. Arab Bank was the busiest stock, with shares worth nearly 150,000 dinars changing hands before it closed down one dinar at 255.50 dinars.</p>
<p>Jordan National Bank and The Housing Bank were also heavily traded but closed little changed at 1.90 dinars and 4.80 dinars respectively.</p>
<p>Overall advancing shares outnumbered declining shares by 18 to 10, with another 14 trading but closing unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 most-traded shares on the exchange rose 0.28 percent to 80.75 points, 3.16 percent down from the start of the year.</p>
