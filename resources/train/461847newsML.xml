<p>Italy goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi made a dramatic last minute save to earn 10-man Juventus a 0-0 draw at Napoli and help them take another step towards their 24th league title on Sunday.</p>
<p>With Parma losing 1-0 at Fiorentina -- their first defeat since January -- Peruzzi's clean-sheet was enough to give Juve a commanding six-point lead at the top of serie A with just nine games to play.</p>
<p>With virtually the last kick of the match, Napoli's Alfredo Aglietti forced Peruzzi into a reflex save after Juventus had kept the home side at bay throughout the second half without their Uruguayan defender Paolo Montero.</p>
<p>Montero was sent off in the 37th minute for denying Nicola Caccia a clear run at goal.</p>
<p>With Alen Boksic and Vladimir Jugovic suspended and Alessandro Del Piero injured, Juve were already up against it.</p>
<p>But the 10 men on show responded with a battling performance that underlines why they have the best defensive record in the league --- 15 goals in 25 matches.</p>
<p>Parma's defeat came via the boot of their French international Lilian Thuram, whose outstanding performances have solidified the Parma defence.</p>
<p>In the 33rd minute, Thuram's outstretched foot deflected a shot from Portugal's Rui Costa beyond the despairing dive of Gian Luigi Buffon and into the net.</p>
<p>Parma's defeat boosted third-placed Internazionale's hopes of qualifying for next season's European Cup as runners-up.</p>
<p>Roy Hodgson's team now trail Parma by just two points following their 2-1 home win over Verona.</p>
<p>Maurizio Ganz, whose goals saw off Anderlecht in the UEFA Cup in midweek, found target again in the 31st minute only to see Filippo Maniero equalise within two minutes.</p>
<p>But 13 minutes into the second-half, Ganz's overhead kick set up Marco Branca for his side's winner.</p>
<p>Sampdoria are a further point adrift in fourth after fighting back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Piacenza with goals from Vincenzo Montella -- his 17th this season -- and Emanuele Pesaresi.</p>
<p>Dutchman Michel Kreek scored twice as Perugia recovered from 2-1 down to win their relegation clash with Cagliari 3-2.</p>
<p>Champions AC Milan continued to climb, reaching seventh place after a 2-0 victory at Atalanta, only their second win since manager Arrigo Sacchi took charge back in December.</p>
<p>Liberian George Weah silenced the home crowd by heading  the opener in the 10th minute from a Marco Simone cross and Stefano Eranio made sure of the victory in the 67th minute.</p>
<p>Eranio had spent the first half on the bench despite his selection on Saturday in Cesare Maldini's Italy squad.</p>
<p>Lazio's 2-0 victory at Vicenza was marred by a pitch invasion sparked by the dismissal of the home side's defender Giovanni Lopez in the 80th minute. The match was suspended for seven minutes.</p>
