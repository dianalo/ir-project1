<p>Belgian bond and money market afternoon report</p>
<p>Belgian linear bonds (OLOs) ended flat to slightly lower on Monday as markets around Europe went into a holding pattern ahead of the release of key U.S. economic data later in the week.</p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year OLOs maturing May 2006 ended at 6.63 percent, up 0.01 from Friday, with the premium over 10-year Bunds at 24 from 23.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers are definitely waiting for better levels and the odds are in their favour,&quot; one trader commented. Any data confirming the U.S. economy was hotting up will send yields soaring and bond prices falling, he said.</p>
<p>U.S. markets were closed on Monday for Labour Day, as were banks in neighbouring Luxembourg, contributing to a quiet day in Belgium's bond market.</p>
<p>Dealers expected little action before Tuesday's release of the U.S. July leading indicator and National Association of Purchasing Managers Index for August and, further ahead, the key U.S. August employment report on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the really big moves will come on Friday,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Everyone closed down their positions last week and the market is now just waiting.&quot;</p>
