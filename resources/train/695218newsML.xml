<p>Network Peripherals Inc said Monday it expects to report a loss in the second quarter of &quot;up to&quot; $0.69 per share, which will include a one-time charge of about $6.5 million, or $0.54 per share, from the acquisition of NetVision Inc.</p>
<p>The company also said it expects sales of about $10.5 million in the second quarter, a decrease of about 18 percent over last year's second quarter.</p>
<p>The earnings forecast compares with analyst expectations of a break-even second quarter excluding extraordinary items, according to First Call.  </p>
<p>Network Peripherals, which makes high-performance networking solutions for workgroups, said the first quarter's slowdown in sales of its FDDI product line, is continuing. It also blamed the expected second quarter weakness on price reductions on certain of its Fast Ethernet switching products in anticipation of new product introductions.</p>
<p>The company also said the second quarter loss will include expenses of about $500,000, or $0.04 per share, in connection with the end-of-life management of its mature FDDI products, including the write-off of excess inventory and costs associated with the execution of its strategy to transfer production of FDDI products from its California plant to an outside manufacturing partner.</p>
<p>It said the manufacturing shift is expected to cut future operating costs.</p>
