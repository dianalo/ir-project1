<p>Finnish meat processing group Atria Oy said on Friday it would close one of its three slaughter houses by summer 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;Atria's board of directors has decided to continue beef slaughtering and butchering operations at the Ylivieska production plant until summer 1998, after which its operations will be combined with the operations of the Kauhajoki and Kuopio plants,&quot; Atria said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company calculates that it will reduce its annual operating expenses by 12 million markka,&quot; Atria said.</p>
<p>The company said the Ylivieska plant had 105 employees and it would make efforts to place them in its other units.</p>
<p>Beef production in Finland has fallen by about a quarter during the 1990s, and in the future slaughter houses would face increasing competition from imports which would force them to become more efficient, Atria said.</p>
<p>The company's slaughtering volume rose by 5.3 million kgs to 97 million kgs in 1996, Atria said.</p>
