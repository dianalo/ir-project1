<p>An Australian conman who paid for his wedding reception with a cheque stolen from one of his guests was described on Friday as a &quot;predator&quot; by a judge who sentenced him to five years in jail.</p>
<p>&quot;You have added new meaning to the word contemptible,&quot; judge Patrick Shanahan told Nektario Zafiratos, who had pleaded guilty to 44 fraud, forgery and theft charges in Brisbane's District Court.</p>
<p>The court was told Zafiratos, 24, had stolen the cheque from the guest and used it to pay for a lavish wedding reception last June at a golf course resort on Queensland state's Gold Coast.</p>
<p>The next day Zafiratos stole the guest's car, which was later found abandoned and extensively damaged in the neighbouring state of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Zafiratos's marriage ended two months later when he was taken into custody after a crime spree which saw him use invalid cheques amounting to A$150,000 (US$115,500) to pay for a sports car, jewellery, clothing and the services of a prostitute.</p>
<p>He also ran up a debt of A$1,300 on a former girlfriend's credit card, which he paid off with a cheque he stole from her.</p>
<p>Shanahan said Zafiratos had also lied in telling his barrister he was enrolled in a New South Wales university.</p>
<p>&quot;It's in the community interest you be detained in prison for a considerable period to protect the business community from predators like you,&quot; Shanahan said.</p>
<p>The court was also told Zafiratos's relatives had offered to buy him a real estate business when he was released from jail. (A$1 = US$0.77)</p>
