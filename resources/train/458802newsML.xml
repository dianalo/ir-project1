<p>Azerbaijan reacted cautiously on Friday to news that the head of its breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region had been nominated prime minister of neighbouring Armenia but diplomats said the move could harm regional peace efforts.</p>
<p>Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan issued a surprise decree on Thursday appointing separatist Robert Kocharyan, whose Karabakh region has been at the centre of a bloody dispute between Armenians and Azeris over the past decade.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to reserve comment until I can determine the motive for (Ter-Petrosyan's) act,&quot; Azeri Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov told reporters by telephone in the Azeri capital Baku.</p>
<p>Deputy Foreign Minister Araz Azimov took a more criticial line, saying Armenia &quot;wanted to reinforce its annexation of the territory of Azerbaijan,&quot; but his comments appeared to be a personal rather than an official reaction.</p>
<p>Azeri government offices were closed on Thursday and Friday for the two-day holiday of Navruz, a Moslem celebration of the arrival of spring. Newspapers did not appear on Friday and state radio and television made no mention of the news.</p>
<p>Surrounded by Azeri territory, the region is populated mostly by ethnic Armenians. It broke away from Baku's rule in the late 1980s, triggering years of fighting between Moslem Azeris and Christian Armenians in which thousands were killed.</p>
<p>Western diplomats in Baku close to negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Karabakh's future said Kocharyan's appointment seemed to indicate that Yerevan had decided to take a harder line on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that this was a surprise for the Azeri government and that it might influence peace negotiations very negatively. It will be much harder to make progress,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>He said he thought Ter-Petrosyan, who gave no explanation for his decision, had acted to pacify nationalist and opposition groups who have until now seen his rule as illegitimate.</p>
<p>The 51-year old leader sent tanks into the streets of the capital Yerevan last year to put down protests by his opponents who accused him of rigging presidential elections. Foreign monitors said the vote was marred by fraud and irregularities.</p>
<p>&quot;Ter-Petrosyan's domestic position has been considerably weakened. He is under great pressure to find common ground with the opposition,&quot; said the diplomat.</p>
<p>Kocharyan will replace Armen Sarkisyan who resigned earlier this month because of bad health.</p>
<p>On Friday Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Armenian officials in Yerevan as saying the appointment of Kocharyan would not have a negative effect on peace talks, provided Azerbaijan did not try to exploit the move for its own benefit.</p>
<p>Armenia has always insisted it was not formally involved in the fighting over Karabakh, despite being fully sympathetic to the separatists. Azerbaijan says Armenia used local separatists merely as a cover for its attempts to annex the territory.</p>
<p>Violence ended with the signing of a 1994 ceasefire but no peace deal has been found despite international mediation.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan is especially keen to solve the Karabakh conflict because of multi-billion dollar projects that have been launched to develop offshore oil deposits in the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>One of the planned pipelines, to deliver oil to Europe via Georgia's Black Sea ports, would run along the Karabakh border.</p>
<p>Political analysts have said that long-term political stability is a crucial factor for foreign investors in the oil project.</p>
<p>Landlocked Armenia, exhausted by years of conflict, has also appeared reluctant to let open hostility with Azerbaijan upset the relative calm of the past two years.</p>
