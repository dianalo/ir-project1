<p>Canadian Airlines Corp., struggling to avert bankruptcy amid heavy losses, said it would push ahead with a rescue plan even though two of its biggest unions were opposing the deal.</p>
<p>After weeks of marathon negotiations, the airline has cobbled together a survival plan involving government assistance and wage concessions from workers that would save it C$70 million ($52 million) a year for four years.</p>
<p>But two of its biggest unions -- the Canadian Auto Workers union and the Canadian Union of Public Employees -- refused to agree to pay cuts.</p>
<p>After last-ditch talks throughout Wednesday night, Canadian Airlines President Kevin Benson told reporters the company and the four unions that support the proposal had decided to proceed in the expectation that the two holdout unions would ultimately agree.</p>
<p>Describing the move as a gamble, he challenged the two other unions to put the bailout package to a membership vote. &quot;I am very confident that a week from today we will have a fully ratified agreement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Canadian, Canada's second-biggest airline, had set a deadline of midnight Wednesday for an agreement, warning it would be forced to cease operations early next year if all six unions did not accept the restructuring plan. Canadian is groaning under C$2.8 billion ($2.1 billion) of debt and lease obligations and has not turned a profit this decade.</p>
<p>But the deadline passed with CAW and CUPE, who represent 6,300 of the company's 16,400 workers, holding firm in opposition to wage cuts. They insist Canada's federal government should offer more aid to the airline.</p>
<p>Ottawa announced it would participate in the bailout plan. Along with provincial governments of Alberta and British Columbia, the federal government offered a fuel tax rebate that would save Canadian C$35 million ($26 million) a year. They also agreed to extend repayment of C$30 million ($23 million) in loans owed by Canadian by 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Wage concessions from employees would yield another C$35 million ($26 million) in savings.</p>
<p>Canadian's survival strategy also entails a restructuring of its routes and concessions from one-third owner AMR Corp., the parent company of American Airlines.</p>
<p>Benson insisted the deal was not open to negotiation and said pressure from rank-and-file CAW and CUPE workers would likely force the union leaders to bend.</p>
<p>But CUPE President Judy Darcy was adamant that her union would not put the bailout plan to a membership vote without further negotiations. Airline workers who support the plan shouted insults and booed as she spoke to reporters.</p>
<p>The main disagreement appears to be a sliding scale for wage concessions. Under the company's plan, employees earning less than C$23,000 ($17,300) a year would not take a pay cut while workers earning the highest wages of more than C$100,000 ($75,000) would take about an eight percent pay cut. The average would be about five percent.</p>
<p>But Darcy said her union wants workers earning C$30,000 ($22,500) or less to be exempt from pay cuts.</p>
<p>The other four unions were drafting plans for members to vote on the package and Benson intends to present the proposal to the company's creditors on Saturday.</p>
