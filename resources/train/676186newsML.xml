<p>Index bonds underlying the municipal futures contract once again outperformed the broader market ahead of Thursday's June settlement, market players said Friday.</p>
<p>A trader said between noon and 1500 EDT Thursday, the overall municipal market was unchanged to weaker.</p>
<p>&quot;Except at a quarter to three (1445 EDT), mysteriously every broker bid on index bonds was up 1/8 of a point,&quot; the trader said, adding that few players if any were aware of the better bids.</p>
<p>&quot;I happened to have a screen up at a quarter to three, and I saw all the bids go in,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody even had a chance to hit the bids.&quot;</p>
<p>Last June, complaints were made to the Chicago Board of Trade regarding the June 1996 muni contract settlement. Players then speculated that index bonds were being run up in an attempt to increase the contract's value. The contract is cash settled at the price of the index on expiration.</p>
<p>On Friday, a municipal analyst described prices on some bonds in the Bond Buyer's 40-Bond Index as &quot;on the high side,&quot; Thursday, but added that the disparity &quot;wasn't nearly on the scale of what's gone on in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said a good example of Thursday's price disparities were some 5.60 percent University of Missouri bonds. They were priced in the index Thursday night at a 5.50 percent yield, he said. On Friday morning, when $2.5 million of them came out for the bid, the high bid was 5.56 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;That's six basis points, that's huge,&quot; the trader said, adding that while the University of Missouri bonds cheapened, the broader market was unchanged from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The 2:45 p.m. (1445 EDT) run-up on Thursday was significant because the Bond Buyer requires brokers to collect prices between then and 3:00 p.m. (1500 EDT), the trader said. He called the index bonds' rise &quot;deliberate manipulation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I call it manipulation because I believe that if you don't buy bonds and you push up the market, that is known as manipulation,&quot; he said. &quot;If you buy bonds on pushing up the market, then you have in fact paid the price for pushing up the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade spokeswoman Kiki Melonides said while the Board does not comment on expirations, &quot;we monitor all contracts, and we heighten that monitoring especially during expiration.&quot;</p>
