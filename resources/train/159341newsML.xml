<title>USA: Health Management credit line reinstated.</title>
<headline>Health Management credit line reinstated.</headline>
<dateline>BUFFALO GROVE, Ill. 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Health Management Inc said on Friday that lenders reinstated $1 million of its total senior credit facility, which had been frozen.</p>
<p>The company also said it is aggressively pursuing strategic alternatives, including interim and long-term financing, a possible sale or merger of the company or a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.  </p>
<p>Health Management said its lenders originally entered into a forbearance agreement in July 1996 and that agreement continues to have an agreement relating to the $1 million loan.</p>
<p>In addition, under terms of the agreement relating to the new $1 million loan, the lenders had requested that the company grant them a warrant to buy five percent of the common stock of the company. Terms and conditions are still being negotiated.  </p>
<p>William Nicol, Health Management president, said in a statement: &quot;The company continues to operate under significant cash flow constraints. The recent bankruptcy filing by the company's primary product wholesaler, Foxmeyer, has put significant additional strain on our cash flow.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicol added that the company was &quot;aggressively pursuing our strategic and financial alternatives...any of which could be highly dilutive to existing shareholders.&quot;</p>
<p>Health Management provides integrated pharmacy management services to patients with chronic medical conditions and to health care professionals and drug manufacturers.</p>
