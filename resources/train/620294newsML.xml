<headline>Dow waffles at midday, watching bond yield again.</headline>

<p>U.S. blue chip shares flirted restlessly with positive territory by midday on Wednesday, turning themselves around from morning weakness after the long bond yield fell back to the seven percent level.</p>
<p>The Dow industrial average was off about one point to 7382, after a brief foray higher. A morning bout of profit-taking cut into yesterday's powerful gains.</p>
<p>Stocks looked once again to bonds, as the benchmark 30-year Treasury rose 11/32 to yield seven percent. On Tuesday, shares rose despite a downturn in bonds.  </p>
<p>&quot;Bonds are rallying and stocks are moving up on the back of that,&quot; Dan Ascani, president and director of research at Global Market Strategists Inc, said.</p>
<p>While the Dow debated whether or not to move higher for the second day this week, the Nasdaq composite rose slightly, trading up around one point, or 0.09 percent, at 1410.</p>
<p>Both the Dow and the Nasdaq closed at record levels on Tuesday. The Dow continued to struggle with the 7,400-level, surging at one point yesterday to 7,394.95.</p>
<p>Bonds, which stocks ignored yesterday, were seen boosted by technical buying on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Technology shares, which pulled the broader stock market higher on Tuesday in the face of a decline in bonds, remained active, analysts said.</p>
<p>But while networking stocks like U.S. Robotics Corp and 3Com Corp traded higher, along with International Business Machines Corp, not all technology stocks displayed strength, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Technology stocks are up, but they are not quite the market leadership that they have been in recent days,&quot; Ascani said. Nasdaq issues were evenly mixed most of the morning, and advancers outpaced decliners by a scant 19 to 18 margin.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rally has thinned out at the top,&quot; Ascani said.</p>
<p>A trader at Guzman &amp; Co said: &quot;There is a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the market. We also have not seen as much institutional support as we did in recent days.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said stock market sentiment was extremely bullish, partly explaining why stocks shrugged off declines in bonds yesterday, but rose when bonds did on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;When technology stocks and small stocks do better, you usually see a bit more positive sentiment,&quot; Robert von Pentz, a managing partner at Columbia Partners, said.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 index was up 0.67 points at 377.  </p>
<p>Ascani said his firm's sentiment indicators were showing the most overly bullish sentiment levels in years.</p>
<p>&quot;When sentiment is that bullish, people will use almost any reason to buy stocks until the rally ends,&quot; he said, adding he was monitoring a 7414 resistance level for the Dow.</p>
<p>Among active issues, IBM was trading up 1-7/8 at 91-1/4, giving effect to a two-for-one stock split.</p>
<p>Bay Network was up two points at 24-3/4. Soundview Financial said it boosted its rating on the shares to a short-term buy from a hold.</p>
<p>Networking stock 3Com was up three to 49-3/4.  </p>
<p>Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co said analyst Paul Johnson raised his rating on shares of the company to buy from market performer based on increasing investor expectations and indications of improving business trends.</p>
<p>But Intel Corp was trading off 1-1/16 at 168-1/4. Intel filed a countersuit against Digital Equipment Corp alleging Digital refused Intel requests to return confidential information. It suggested it might stop providing its Pentium chips to Digital within months.</p>
<p>Digital was off 5/8 at 36-1/4.</p>
