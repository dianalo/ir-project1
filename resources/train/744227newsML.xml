<title>AUSTRALIA: Meridian firms after Estate Mortgage deal.</title>
<headline>Meridian firms after Estate Mortgage deal.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-21</dateline>

<p>The units of Meridian Investment Trust rose at the opening on Monday after settlement of the Estate Mortgage legal dispute with Burns, Philp &amp; Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Meridian was up eight cents at A$1.55, while Burns Philp was also a touch firmer, up one cent to A$2.45.</p>
<p>Volume was light for both stocks.</p>
<p>Analysts said the settlement was in line with market expectations of around A$100 million.  </p>
<p>Under the deal Burns Philp will pay Meridian A$90 in cash and issue it with 12 million convertible notes at A$2.20 each.</p>
<p>Meridian, formerly the Estate Mortgage group, said the settlement would deliver the trusts a minimum value of A$116.4 milion.</p>
<p>Tyndall Australia Ltd, the manager of the trust, said the settlement would substantially strengthen its financial position.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the settlement may have been spurred by a desire by Burns Philp to end the long-running dispute and focus on operational problems at the troubled herbs and spice group.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very good news for Burns Philp,&quot; said BNP Equities analyst Helen Cameron. &quot;I think it makes very good common sense to get it out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>The settlement underpinned a A$2.50 share price, Cameron added.</p>
<p>New Zealand investor Graeme Hart last month took a 19.9 percent interest in Burns Philp, paying A$2.50 a share.  </p>
<p>The acquisition surprised the market as it was well above Burns Philp's share price at the time.</p>
<p>Burns Philp subsidiary Burns Philp Trustee Co was the trustee for Estate Mortgage from 1983 until it went into liquidation in 1990, with debts of more than A$600 million.</p>
<p>Former Estate Mortgage auditors Priestley &amp; Morris agreed to pay Meridian A$31 million in an out of court settlement in April this year.</p>
