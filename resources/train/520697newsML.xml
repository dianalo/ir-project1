<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- ends flat, awaiting supply.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. municipal bond market passed a mostly uneventful Friday with little appreciable price action ahead of next week's building supply.</p>
<p>Traders said the tone appeared to be firming, as prices were unchanged to up 1/8 point on the day. &quot;Most of the improvement was on the long end,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Some bid-wanted lists circulated during the day, but the totals were modest, a market participant said.</p>
<p>A key focus of next week will be the new supply set to hit the market, especially in the negotiated sector.</p>
<p>Sales are expected to total $3.6 billion in 103 deals, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group. That's up from $2.3 billion sold this week.</p>
<p>Negotiated offerings next week total $3 billion in 38 sales, with a $920 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey issue through Smith Barney Inc. topping the list.</p>
<p>On the competitive side, 65 sales totaling $583 million are on the schedule. A $44 million Norfolk, Va., deal on Wednesday is the largest.</p>
<p>Friday's action was similarly muted in the Treasury market, where short-covering helped boost the 30-year bond 4/32 to 94-21/32 and a 7.06 percent yield.</p>
<p>Futures also ended higher, with the June municipal contract up 6/32 at 112-26/32 and June T-bonds up 5/32 to 108. The MOB spread widened to 154 ticks from 153 ticks at the close on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, bids on Delaware River Port Authority FGIC 5-1/2s of 2026 were down three basis points to 5.83 percent. Texas State Turnpike Authority Dallas North Thruway FGIC 5.0s of 2025 were unchanged at 5.85 percent.</p>
