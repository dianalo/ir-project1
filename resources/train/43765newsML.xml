<p>Chinese soldiers posted to the remote and restive region of Tibet are to be rewarded more handsomely for their pains, the Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After several years of research, Beijing had decided to grant a bigger subsidy to officers and troops sent to the Himalayan region, regarded as a hardship post for Chinese sent there, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Communist) Party Central Committee, the State Council and the Central Military Commission are extremely concerned about units posted in Tibet...and so have set forth a policy to improve welfare benefits for troops,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>The new subsidy would take effect from October 1 and would raise salaries and benefits of soldiers in Tibet to about 3.5 times higher than those of soldiers elsewhere, it said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Chinese troops have occupied Tibet since 1950 and are frequently used in quelling anti-Chinese protests and in ensuring the loyalty of the deeply Buddhist populace to Beijing.</p>
<p>China is believed to deploy a large military force in Tibet, which is a strategic area on the border with India, Nepal, Bhutan and Burma.</p>
