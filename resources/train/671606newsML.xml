<p>Irish finance minister Ruairi Quinn said on Wednesday that he believed European economic and monetary union (EMU) would commence on time and that Ireland would participate from the start.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no doubt following the decisions taken by the European Council in Amsterdam that Europe is on course for the introduction of the single currency on January 1, 1999,&quot; Quinn told an EMU conference held by the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA).</p>
<p>EU heads of state meeting in Amsterdam on Monday and Tuesday agreed on a stability and growth pact, designed to ensure budgetary discipline among member states after the introduction of a single currency.</p>
<p>They also adopted a resolution on growth and employment, putting employment at the top of the EU's political agenda, Quinn said.</p>
<p>He said member states had once again confirmed their commitment to the commencement of EMU in accordance with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and the timetable agreed by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995.</p>
<p>Quinn said it had to be expected that in the course of completing an ambitious project on the scale of EMU that problems would arise from time to time.</p>
<p>&quot;I am, however, convinced that the clear commitment to EMU demonstrated once again by the European Council this week will ensure the successful completion of the project in accordance with the treaty and the timetable laid down at Madrid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted that the timetable for EMU had now been confirmed by EU heads of state and government at four successive meetings.</p>
