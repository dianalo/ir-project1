<p>Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army mounted an assault on Hutu rebel forces on Thursday, trying to drive them from hills overlooking the capital, an army spokesman said.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi said fighting began at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Nyambuye and Gishingano hills and swung north towards Tenga village, five km (three miles) northeast of the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebels are taking refuge at Tenga so the fighting has moved in that direction,&quot; Nibizi told Reuters in Bujumbura.</p>
<p>The blasts of explosions from mortar bombs and artillery and volleys of machinegun fire resounded through the steep hills close to the suburb of Mutanga North for a third straight day.</p>
<p>Dozens of Hutu peasants fled from the hills to temporary camps on the outskirts of Bujumbura to escape the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of soldiers came up the hill towards where we live, so we fled here. We didn't stay to see what would happen,&quot; said Anastasi Misigaro, a Hutu woman who fled Nyambuye on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the mono-ethnic army which is responsible for this war. They started it by killing our president (Melchior Ndadaye) and the army comes and steals our crops,&quot; Misigaro added.</p>
<p>Civil war and massacres have killed more than 150,000 people since Ndadaye was killed in 1993, provoking fears of a bloodbath similar to Rwanda where up to an estimated one million people died in 1994.</p>
<p>The army said three soldiers and 20 rebels were killed on Wednesday. Nibizi said a total of 10 weapons were captured but the rebels still had an 85 mm mortar and 60 mm mortars.</p>
<p>The army on Wednesday used two helicopters mounted with machineguns and a single-engine plane to strafe and rocket an area a few kilometres (miles) east of the city, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Rebels attacked Bujumbura's suburbs on Tuesday in the first fighting near the capital since Tutsi Pierre Buyoya seized power on July 25 in an army coup and ousted the Hutu president.</p>
<p>The rebels said the attacks were a show of strength against the Tutsi capital hit hard by sanctions imposed by neighbouring states pressing Buyoya to agree to talk peace and step down.</p>
<p>Buyoya says the rebels must first lay down their arms.</p>
<p>A wounded soldier taken to Kamenge military hospital in Bujumbura after being shot in the thigh in fighting on Wednesday described what he said was a fierce battle for Nyambuye hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Rebels occupied a position which dominated the hill. We made an approach with three platoons but it was difficult,&quot; said Nestor Magendero, estimating thousands of rebels were at Nyambuye.</p>
<p>The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) said a shortage of fuel was severely hampering its distribution of biscuits to up to 5,000 people displaced in the last few days in two districts.</p>
<p>&quot;UNICEF will follow the movement of these displaced people closely, but with the best will in the world, the operation is being undermined by a lack of fuel,&quot; its Burundi representative said.</p>
<p>Rebels killed one person on Wednesday in the latest of a string of ambushes on the road between Muramvya town east of Bujumbura and Burundi's second city Gitega, the army said.</p>
<p>Members of Burundi's mainstream Hutu Frodebu party said on Wednesday they backed the main Hutu rebel party and its military wing and urged Frodebu leader Jean Minani to announce their alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;This doesn't come as a surprise,&quot; said Buyoya's spokesman Jean-Luc Ndizeye. &quot;They are at last coming out of the closet, but there has always been collusion between them.&quot;</p>
