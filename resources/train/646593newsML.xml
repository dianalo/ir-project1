<title>UKRAINE: Ukraine T-bills yields to slip more, dealers say.</title>
<headline>Ukraine T-bills yields to slip more, dealers say.</headline>
<dateline>KIEV 1997-06-09</dateline>

<p>Ukraine's Finance Ministry will be able to cut yields further at auctions of Treasury bills due to increased demand caused by a forthcoming 30 percent tax on T-bill earnings, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Ukrinbank's Ivan Budko said investors were purchasing larger quantities of the paper before the tax comes in on July 1.</p>
<p>Average yields at the latest auctions last week slipped to 19.83 percent from 20.25 percent on six-month paper, to 28.26 percent from 28.54 percent on nine-month paper, and to 30.85 percent from 28.28 percent on 12-month paper.</p>
<p>Budko said yields on nine-month bills would drop more quickly than on 12-month bills due to higher demand at recent auctions.</p>
<p>&quot;It's possible, maybe not at the next auction but soon after, that the Finance Ministry will lower yields on nine-month bills to 26 percent from 28.26 percent,&quot; Budko said.</p>
<p>Ukraine's central bank will auction six-month, nine-month and 12-month discount Treasury bills on June 10.</p>
<p>Perkombank's Serhiy Matveychuk said the ministry appeared to be trying to bring yields on nine-month bills to about 25 percent, and to 28 percent on 12-month paper.</p>
<p>But he said the speed at which this would be accomplished depended on passage of the budget, an official announcement of a currency corridor, and participation of the central bank in purchasing Treasury-bills.</p>
<p>&quot;If the budget were accepted, then you would see an obvious drop in one to two weeks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ukraine is expecting to raise 3.3 billion hryvnias from T-bills to cover its deficit, which the much-delayed budget has forecast at 5.7 billion hryvnias.</p>
<p>Dealers said Ministry of Finance would not sell three-month bills until passage of the budget, expected by the end of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe someone would buy three-month bills at 15 percent, but the Finance Ministry does not want to sell them below 22 percent,&quot; Matveychuk said.</p>
<p>The ministry stopped sales of three-month bills in mid-May when yields stood at 21.15 percent.</p>
<p>Mykola Shevchenko, a T-bill analyst at Kinto Securities and Investments, forecast a drop of about half a percent on yields of six-, nine-, and 12-month paper because the government had recently made large payments and earnings on T-bills.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week the government covered large T-bill payments of 49 million hryvnias and it earned 181 million hryvnias in budget revenues,&quot; Shevchenko said, adding it was due to pay out 70 million hryvnias this week.</p>
<p>Annual inflation has been forecast at about 25 percent this year against 39.7 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Ukraine's deputy prime minister in charge of the economy Serhiy Tyhypko announced a currency corridor, or trading band, for the hryvnia of 1.70 to 1.90 to the dollar in April, but higher government officials have since denied existence of a formal corridor. ($1 = 1.8590 hryvnias)</p>
