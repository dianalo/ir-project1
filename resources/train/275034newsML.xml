<p>TeleCheck Services said Tuesday there was a 5.7 percent gain in same-store retail sales for the first 24 days of the Christmas shopping season.</p>
<p>TeleCheck, a check acceptance company and a unit of First Data Corp, based its figures on a year-over-year, same-store comparison of the dollar volume of authorized checks written by consumers at about 27,000 of TeleCheck's 160,000 subscribing locations.</p>
<p>Checks account for more than a third of retail spending, TeleCheck said.  </p>
<p>&quot;As we approach the end of the shopping season, it appears that same-store retail sales have continued to do reasonably well,&quot; said William Ford, TeleCheck's senior economic adviser.</p>
<p>On January 7 the company will issue same-store sales numbers for the entire holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>In the first 24 days of the season, the Southwest led with a 7.9 percent gain in sales. Sales rose 7.0 percent in the Midwest, 6.6 percent in the Southeast, 5.9 percent in both the Mid-Atlantic and the West, and 0.8 percent in the Northeast, TeleCheck said.</p>
