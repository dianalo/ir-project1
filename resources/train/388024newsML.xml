<p>A Gulf Arab committee has failed to agree on standards to unify custom tariffs on about a third of items imported by the oil-rich Gulf Cooperation Council member states, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The GCC officials said the technical committee, which ended its meetings in Saudi Arabia earlier in the day, would meet in late April to continue deliberations. In the past two years, it unified tariffs on 930 out of 1280 imported commodities.</p>
<p>&quot;A compromise agreement was reached under which the GCC secretariat will prepare an explanatory memorandum on standards defined by the recent GCC summit regarding the commodities at stake,&quot; Abdul-Rahman al-Mutawa, head of Qatar's delegation, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be sent to member states before the next meeting,&quot; the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>A full agreement unifying the tariffs is a key condition by other major trading groups for forging a free trade accord with the the Gulf Arab region.</p>
<p>The GCC, a political and economic alliance, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.</p>
<p>The April meeting comes ahead of a gathering in Saudi Arabia in May of GCC finance ministers.</p>
<p>The committee is studying three categories of imports and respective custom duties -- tax-free basic commodities, basic items with reduced tariffs and luxury commodities with traditional custom rates.</p>
<p>GCC officials said the committee decided to seek legal advice as it remained divided on some of the remaining goods which belonged to the first and second categories.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is no disagreement on luxury commodities,&quot; Mutawa added.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what the goods subject to the disagreement included.</p>
<p>GCC states said at their annual summit in Doha in December they needed another two to three years to unify custom tariffs.</p>
<p>EU-GCC talks on forging a free trade accord have been blocked for more than 10 years by the European Union's demand that GCC states should first unify tariffs.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers of the GCC and the EU met in Doha on Monday and set a 1998 deadline to complete their negotiations on an inter-regional free trade pact.</p>
<p>Differences between some GCC members have for years prevented any agreement on the step which is needed for the alliance to move towards forming a common market.</p>
<p>The UAE, a major trading and re-export hub, is reluctant to raise tariffs beyond the four to six percent level which is imposed on most goods while Saudi Arabia, which has tariffs of 20 percent on some items, is in favour of a GCC unified level of 8-12 percent for most goods.</p>
