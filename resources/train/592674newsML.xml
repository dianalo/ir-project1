<p>Mother Teresa of Calcutta needed oxygen when she arrived at Rome airport on Friday but doctors said there was no cause for alarm and she was in good spirits.</p>
<p>The 86-year-old nun, known as the saint of the gutters, was given oxygen for about 20 minutes in a VIP lounge at Rome airport after arriving from New Delhi.</p>
<p>&quot;She had some oxygen because she was tired,&quot; said Giancarlo Fanti,&quot; a member of the medical team who assisted the Nobel Prize winner after her arrival.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a long trip but there is no cause for worry. She was very happy, in good spirits and wanted to talk. Everything is in order,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Vincenzo Bilotta, an Italian cadiologist who has treated Mother Teresa, also said there was no reason for alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;I found her in good condition. The oxygen is a normal procedure for someone like her,&quot; Bilotta said. An ambulance was waiting outside in case of emergencies.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa, making her first foreign trip since she suffered serious health problems last year, blessed and smiled at reporters as she was taken in a wheelchair to a waiting car, which she was able to enter unaided.</p>
<p>The silver-haired nun was due to be taken to a Rome convent run by members of his missionary sisters which will be her base during her Rome visit.</p>
<p>Italian families adopting four Indian children who arrived with the nun on the flight from New Delhi were at the airport.</p>
<p>&quot;She blessed this new family of ours,&quot; said an Italian woman who adopted a 20-month-old girl named Romina Maria.</p>
<p>The highlights of Mother Teresa's visit to Rome are a meeting with Pope John Paul, not yet scheduled, and an initiation ceremony where new nuns will take their vows.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa has said she would also like to accompany the Pope to Poland for part of his visit there next month and perhaps travel to the United States if her health allowed.</p>
<p>She was forced to step down as head of her religious order in March as she battled against heart disease.</p>
<p>She was accompanied to Rome by her successor as superior-general of the Missionaries of Charity, Sister Nirmala, and her Indian doctor, Patricia Aubanel.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of Mother Teresa's visit to the Pope is to formally introduce Sister Nirmala, who took over when Mother Teresa stepped down after being admitted to hospital three times last year for emergency care and heart surgery.</p>
<p>Aubanel, who was part of the team that carried out the operations in 1991, 1993 and 1996, told reporters in India earlier this week that she had advised the nun to limit her trip to Rome.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's recent tours outside India have been marred by ill health.</p>
<p>On a visit to Europe in 1993, she injured three ribs in a fall. On a trip to the United States in 1991, she fell ill midway through the visit and had to undergo the first of her three heart operations.</p>
