<headline>CalEnergy to bounce back quickly from NYSEG.</headline>

<p>CalEnergy Co Inc is expected to rebound quickly from its failed attempt to acquire New York State Electric &amp; Gas Corp (NYSEG) by buying another Northeast utility as deregulation grips the once-staid sector.</p>
<p>Wall Street experts said CalEnergy's decision to drop the bid for NYSEG reflected its certainty that there will be plenty of other opportunities for the aggressive Nebraska-based independent power producer.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the company has demonstrated they are disciplined acquirers,&quot; said Ali Agha of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.  </p>
<p>CalEnergy earlier Friday said the tender offer for 9.9 percent of NYSEG had expired and was undersubscribed. The company had launched a $24.50 per share offer as the first step in its effort to buy all of NYSEG for $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>CalEnergy stock rose 3/8 to 35-3/4 amid broad market declines.</p>
<p>CalEnergy chairman David Sokol earlier this week had said he would not extend the tender and would walk away from the bid if it did not generate enough shareholder support. NYSEG shares closed at $25.25 on Thursday, above the amount being offered in the tender.  </p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's stock price was an indication people were going to call his bluff,&quot; said one takeover trader.</p>
<p>But traders also expressed surprise Sokol was willing to give up so quickly after lining up financing for a deal and paying bankers and lawyers to put the effort together.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole thing is a mystery to me. Maybe something else came to his attention since this started,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Wall Street experts speculated that Sokol is likely to concentrate future acquisition efforts in the Northeast, particularly in New York or Pennsylvania. Analysts said he also recently has expressed interest in the Southwest.  </p>
<p>Wall Street initially had been surprised by CalEnergy's interest in NYSEG, saying it was a high-cost, slow growth utility. But Sokol said he targeted the utility because New York will be at the forefront of states grappling with doing business in a deregulated environment.</p>
<p>Sokol has a mixed track record for transactions. He won British utility Northern Electric Plc late last year for $1.3 billion after a bitter fight. Previously, he withdrew a bid for Magma Power after being rejected, but evenutally won the company.  </p>
<p>NYSEG had urged shareholders not to tender their shares and refused to negotiate a deal, saying the offer did not reflect the company's inherent value. Over the past few weeks, the relationship between the firms had grown increasingly contentious and lawsuits were filed on both sides.</p>
<p>CalEnergy continued to criticize NYSEG on Fridayy.</p>
<p>&quot;NYSEG management engaged in a scorched earth campaign which, in the span of just a few weeks, wasted an enormous amount of money that could have been used to create value for shareholders and lower rates for customers,&quot; CalEnergy said in its statement Friday.</p>
<p>NYSEG has said it plans to soon review its dividend and stock buyback policy, noting that a recent rate agreement struck with regulators will create greater flexibility for expansion.</p>
