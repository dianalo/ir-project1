<p>Argentine bonds bounced higher in early trade Wednesday in a technical rebound which was then helped along by the strength of U.S. Treasuries based on good U.S. inflation data, dealers said.</p>
<p>The early rebound, from Tuesday's losses on fears Brazil might devalue, was flattened slightly by confirmation of reports that Argentina would delay the issue of a $750 million global bond because of volatility in emerging markets.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't really hurt when first reports came out but when it was confirmed the market took a bit of a hit,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;However, if the U.S. markets continue this strong, the market here will probably hold at this level.&quot;</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 was up 1/5 at 94.10 while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 was unchanged at 118.20.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was also helped by the success of the sale of the 10 percent of the share capital of Argentine oil firm YPF which was still in the hands of employees. About 96 percent was placed at $29.25.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not a great price, but it helped,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
