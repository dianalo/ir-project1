<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Thursday he would welcome neutral Austria's membership of the Western European Union and NATO, but emphasised it was a matter for the Austrians alone to decide.</p>
<p>Kinkel met Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky for talks on European Union enlargement and other issues, including NATO and the Western European Union (WEU), the EU's future defence arm.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally would be very happy if they would join (the WEU and NATO), but I will not give any advice,&quot; Kinkel told Reuters. &quot;Austrian neutrality can only be a matter for the government and parliament.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinkel, on a one-day visit to Vienna on the sixth anniversary of German unification, said full membership of the WEU would only be possible in the context of NATO membership because of the commitment to guarantee assistance in the event of a military attack on one of the member states.</p>
<p>Austria obtained observer status at the WEU after joining the EU in January last year.</p>
<p>The conservative People's Party (OeVP), which ruled in coalition with Vranitzky's Social Democrats, has pressed for full WEU membership in the past few months, forcing a debate on the sensitive issue of neutrality.</p>
<p>OeVP leader and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, who met Kinkel earlier, said Austria was bound by its EU membership to work towards building a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>But if Austria were to give up its neutrality it must do so of its own free will, Schuessel added.</p>
<p>In a separate speech to Austrian businessmen, Kinkel expressed strong support for EU enlargement to include Eastern Europe's ex-communist states, European Monetary Union and the Euro, the EU's proposed single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The Euro must come. The train is ready to leave,&quot; he said, noting that a single currency would benefit hard-currency countries like Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>Kinkel also addressed the Vienna-based Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), urging the forum to work with NATO and the EU to bolster future security in Europe.</p>
<p>The OSCE should use its summit in Lisbon in December to show it was ready to play its part in an integrated European security structure for the 21st century, Kinkel told ambassadors from the body's 53 member nations.</p>
<p>The OSCE includes most of Europe, the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the summit) must send a signal that the OSCE is willing and able to make a considerable independent contribution to the European security architecture,&quot; he said.</p>
