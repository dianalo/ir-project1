<p>More than 1,000 Italian, French and Spanish troops began arriving by air and sea on Tuesday to spearhead an eight-nation protection force for humanitarian aid supplies in violence-racked Albania.</p>
<p>The French transport ship Orage with 450 French troops reached the western port of Durres at seven a.m. (0500 GMT) to launch the U.N.-approved mission.</p>
<p>Italian military aircraft carrying 160 Italian paratroopers landed just moments before at Tirana airport, about 40 km (25 miles) east of Durres.</p>
<p>A total of about 6,000 troops will arrive during the next two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;This operation is not only a test of the European identity, but it is also an important investment to strengthen Albania's relations with the family of nations in Europe,&quot; said Albanian Foreign Minister Arjan Starova.</p>
<p>The Balkan country's armed insurrection has claimed nearly 300 lives, with tens of thousands of weapons ending up in the hands of mafias and ordinary Albanians after raids on abandoned state armouries.</p>
<p>Although a strictly enforced 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew has helped Albania restore a semblance of order in recent weeks, hardly a day passes without incidents of violence.</p>
<p>Heavy exchanges of gunfire were heard in Tirana on Tuesday evening and security near government buildings was tighter than usual.</p>
<p>Police killed an escaped convict on Monday in a shootout in the southeastern town of Bilisht. The man had shot and wounded two police officers and another person.</p>
<p>In the northern town of Shkoder, a gunman shot dead a hospital patient who was undergoing emergency surgery for gunshot wounds, the Albanian news agency ATA said.</p>
<p>As the multinational troops were sent to Albania, U.N. and Red Cross officials in Tirana warned that the country's poor were desperately in need of food. One in 10 Albanians were in need of humanitarian aid, they said.</p>
<p>The U.N. World Food Programme planned to deliver a shipment to the town of Albasan as soon as it arrived in Durres on Tuesday. More than 400 tonnes of wheat flour, beans and vegetable oil was expected at the port during the day.</p>
<p>Admiral Guido Venturoni, Italy's defence chief of staff and overall commander of the eight-nation force, said in Rome the troops would use force if necessary to defend themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;Force will be used only when it is indispensable,&quot; Venturoni said after a final planning meeting of diplomats and military experts from the eight nations.</p>
<p>But Venturoni said the soldiers would not stand by and do nothing if they witnessed violence against individuals, as United Nations peacekeepers had to do in Bosnia at times.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have the right to use force...to protect people from serious criminal acts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Greece, Turkey, Austria, Denmark and Romania are also contributing soldiers to the mission.</p>
<p>Durres, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana, and the capital itself are two of the three entry points for the operation.</p>
<p>The third is the southern port of Vlore, in rebel hands since the armed uprising erupted across Albania last month following the collapse of fraudulent savings schemes.</p>
<p>Venturoni said plans to deploy troops in Vlore entirely by sea had been changed because of unfavourable port conditions. Troops would now secure Vlore by land and sea.</p>
<p>Contingents will be gradually deployed throughout Albania, with bases in 10 towns from Shkoder in the north to the port of Sarande in the south. The troops will patrol key transport routes to ensure the distribution of aid.</p>
<p>Herve Gourmelon, spokesman for the French military, said the transport ship Orage was carrying 450 French troops, six tanks and four helicopters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to make safe the access road from Durres to Tirana,&quot; Gourmelon said. &quot;This country is safe in some places, not that safe in others.&quot;</p>
