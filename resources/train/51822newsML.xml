<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday that Slovakia must regain the momentum of its economic reforms to improve prospects for a sustained recovery.</p>
<p>Andreas Georgiu, the IMF's respresentative for Slovakia, in reviewing the IMF's 1996 annual report said the fund viewed Slovakia as being on &quot;the cutting edge&quot; of economic performance of post-Communist countries.</p>
<p>But he warned of shortcomings in the reforms. (Corrects to clarify Georgiu's statement).</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, like in all other leading countries there are various areas, especially one of structural reform, in which progress can be made,&quot; Georgiu told a news conference.</p>
<p>Georgiu said the country's impressive macroeconomic success in the 1993-1995 period was &quot;entirely due to the very conservative and approprirate&quot; macroecomic policy.</p>
<p>According to IMF figures, Slovakia's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose 7.4 percent year-on-year in 1995, its inflation rose 7.2 percent, while its annual fiscal balance accounted for 0.0 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>However, Slovakia's GDP growth slowed to 6.9 percent in the second quarter from 7.3 percent in the first quarter, and the growth was mainly due to higher household consumption instead of exports like before, according to Slovak official figures.</p>
<p>Still the lowest in eastern Europe, inflation rose to 5.6 percent year-on-year in August, from 5.5 percent in July.</p>
<p>&quot;The fixed exchange regime in Slovakia has served the country quiet well up to now, it has been one of the fundamental reasons for the inflation performance in the country,&quot; Georgiu said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, because of the prudent monetary and fiscal policy domestic conditions have been such that this fixed exchange rate has not meant noticable losses in competitiveness,&quot; Georgiu added.</p>
<p>Though inflation remained low, the country's current account deficit for the first six months was already within the full-year forecast defict range of $610-965 million after just the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>The foreign trade balance swung to deficit from surplus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, foreign direct investment in Slovakia between January 1990 and June 1996 was a mere $808.4 million,</p>
<p>Investors voiced concerns over Slovakia's commitment to privatisation after the government of Vladimir Meciar cancelled a new wave of citizens' vouchers-for-shares selloffs in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Directors were concerned that setbacks in privatisation had damaged the credibility of the government's commitment to a market economy and reduced the attractiveness of the Slovak Republic to to foreign investors,&quot; the IMF report said.</p>
<p>Last year (Corrects from &quot;Recent&quot;), shortfalls in structural policies had delayed the completion of a review under the country's agreement with the IMF which would have given Slovakia access to $160 million in an IMF stand-by loan to support its balance of payments. -- Tatiana Vacova, Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-210-3687</p>
