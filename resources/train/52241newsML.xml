<headline>Halifax B/S again tops UBS chart.</headline>

<p>Soon to be floated Halifax Building Society has come first in a league table of building society creditworthiness compiled by UBS analyst Rob Thomas. The latest edition of the annual survey places the Halifax first and said the society &quot;has again achieved its objective of being the biggest and the best best building society from a creditor's standpoint.&quot;</p>
<p>The Halifax was in joint first place in the table last year with the Coventry which this year slipped to fourth place.</p>
<p>Second in this year's list was the Northern Rock while the Yorkshire was placed third.  </p>
<p>Despite its high placing, the Yorkshire issued a statement blasting the UBS resarch as &quot;past its sell-by date&quot;, misleading and irrelevant.</p>
<p>&quot;The Yorkshire has featured near the top of the UBS table for many years...(but) times have changed so radically in the industry that we feel this year's report is of little real value,&quot; said Yorkshire finance director Andrew Pearce.  </p>
<p>also announced their intention to float on the stock exchange next year and this has led UBS's Thomas to widen the scope of his survey to include institutions whose core activities centre on retail savings and residential mortgages.</p>
<p>This brings in former building society, Abbey National Plc now categorised as a bank which comes in at number eight in the creditworthiness list but first in terms of assets at 103 billion stg at the end of 1995.  </p>
<p>The most improved society in the survey was the National &amp; Provincial which has since merged with the Abbey. It rose to fifth place from 16th. Thomas notes that in the past year a clear polarisation of strategies has emerged among the societies with four planning to float and become banks while others have moved to protect and promote their mutual status.</p>
<p>The Halifax welcomed its top position recognising the society's consistent performance over the past few years. The Northern Rock said it was encouraged by its placing but accused UBS of changing its performance measures to favour what it called the &quot;hairshirt mutuals.&quot;</p>
