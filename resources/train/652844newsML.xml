<title>RUSSIA: Russian Norilsk sacks precious metals plant head.</title>

<p>Russia's financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel metals group said on Wednesday it had sacked the director of its precious metals processing plant in Krasnoyarsk.</p>
<p>&quot;By decision of the board, Vladimir Gulidov was removed from his position in connection with disturbances in the plant's financial and credit policies,&quot; Norilsk spokesman Sergei Vetchinin said.</p>
<p>No replacement had been named. Gulidov could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Vetchinin said the Krasnoyarsk precious metals plant had suffered losses of 185 billion roubles ($32 million) which had affected its ability to buy precious metals on the secondary market for processing.</p>
<p>&quot;The losses incurred a significant worsening of Krasnoyarsk's position on the secondary market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The plant processes precious metals bought on the secondary market under tolling deals as well as raw materials supplied by Norilsk. Vetchinin could not say what percentage of Krasnoyarsk's output was under tolling deals and declined to name production figures.</p>
<p>The Norilsk Nickel group is one of the world's biggest producers of nickel and platinum group metals, or PGMs. Platinum and palladium are by-products of its nickel mining.</p>
<p>Russia accounts for around 60 percent of the world's palladium supply and one-fifth of platinum deliveries, and Norilsk accounts for nearly all of Russia's PGM production.</p>
