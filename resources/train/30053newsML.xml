<p>The U.S. missile attack on Iraq ripped into Indian share values on Wednesday as it exposed the country's vulnerability to higher oil prices and potential rupee weakness.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange index lost over two percent as crude oil prices added one dollar a barrel, and economists weighed the costs to India in terms of oil subsidies and its huge import bill.</p>
<p>Most Indian market analysts believed any conflict will be short-lived and the effect temporary.</p>
<p>But alarm bells were ringing in a country where oil consumption has almost doubled in the last decade fuelling India's race to catch up with the other Asian Tiger economies.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's just a short term move I don't think there's anything to worry about,&quot; said Ramnath Iyer, investment strategist at Peregrine Capital in Bombay.</p>
<p>But the risk of higher oil prices and investors keeping their money safe in dollars for any sustained period will soon translate into a rough ride for Indian markets.</p>
<p>Anindya Chatterjee, economist at James Capel B &amp; K, said, &quot;If the situation persisted for a month or two there would be severe adverse effects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would create a mounting deficit, and more people will park their money in dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>Chatterjee said he expected volatility in the rupee over the next month and portfolio inflows to be affected.</p>
<p>Those inflows were already drying up in August, falling sharply to $66.7 million in the first 29 days of the month from $302.4 million in July.</p>
<p>Over the very near term, the next 15 to 30 days, he expected the rupee to fall as far as 37 to the dollar from Wednesday's levels around 35.7.</p>
<p>India's oil import demand of some 22-23 million tonnes of crude and 16 million tonnes of refined products cost around $6.5 billion last year and accounted for around 20-22 percent of the country's total imports bill.</p>
<p>The oil pool deficit, effectively the net subsidy for petroleum products, for the year to March 31 was 55-60 billion rupees ($1.54-1.68 billion)</p>
<p>Harshad Patwardham, refining sector analyst at Birla Marlin Partners, estimated that every extra dollar on the oil price will cost the government close to $300 million a year in subsidies.</p>
<p>As long as the subsidy regime is unaltered the refining sector itself should be unaffected as both input and output prices are fixed by the government, Patwardham said, adding that sustained higher oil prices &quot;will have a negative impact on the overall economy.&quot;</p>
