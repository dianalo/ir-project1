<p>THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW</p>
<p>Big mining companies such as Shell, MIM, RTZ-CRA and US-owned ARCO are using the Howard Government's new industrial relations laws to challenge the power of the coal mining union, fighting on a range of fronts to overturn work practices enshrined in the industry award. Page 3.</p>

<p>Insurance and Superannuation Commission figures at the end of 1996 show that total assets in the superannuation system have hit A$271.3 billion and contributions are rising at a rate of 16 per cent a year. The figures show the industry may not be affected by the recent negative publicity about the surcharge for high income earners. Page 3.</p>

<p>Victorian Opposition frontbencher Rob Hulls told the Victorian Parliament yesterday that State Premier Jeff Kennett should explain whether a BMW lent to his wife for two years in return for her acting as an &quot;ambassador&quot; for the company was in fact a &quot;paybck&quot; for opening a new BMW dealership in Melbourne.

<p>New South Wales Legal Services Commissioner Steve Mark has backed down on his apparent criticism of the State's legal profession by qualifying some of his criticisms and disowning others. Mark admitted yesterday he had no figures to substantiate his claim of the previous day that many State solicitors were breaking the law by failing to disclose their fees in advance. Page 5.</p>

<p>THE AUSTRALIAN</p>
<p>Victorian regional bank, the Bank of Melbourne, is the subject of a A$1.4 billion takeover bid by Westpac Bank - against the wishes of Federal Treasurer Peter Costello, who last week warned Australia's banks not to make any commercial decisions until after the release of the Wallis inquiry into financial systems.

<p>Following the release of a report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare which revealed a large gap between the health of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians, Governor-General Sir William Deane warned yesterday that any delay in addressing the health problems of indigenous Australians cannot be justified.

<p>A plan, expected to be discussed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, could see a national DNA database on all violent criminals and suspected felons introduced under Federal legislation. The database would be administered by the National Insttute of Forensic Science, and would include blood samples from murderers, sex offenders, and possibly less violent criminals such as burglars.

<p>Special rules, still being refined, will change the existing scheme of generous superannuation for Federal politicians so that they can pay less under the A$500 million Budget tax on the super of high-income earners. The rules may also see some MPs paying a lower tax rate than members of the public on the same income. Page 1.</p>

<p>THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD</p>
<p>A report released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that the life expectancy of indigenous Australians is as low as that of people in India and central Africa. The damning report stated indigenous people continue to die 15 to 20 years before other Australians, and that there was little improvement in indigenous death rates over the ten years to 1994.

<p>Dr Geoff King of the Royal Flying Doctor Service calls the Cape York area Australia's forgotten country. In an area the size of Victoria, but with only 13,000 people, illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic alcoholism, sexually transmitted disases, and, more recently, youth suicide and infertility, are common.

<p>Federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams is facing lobbying from some States to water down the Federal Sexual Discrimination Act for the first time, by disallowing unmarried women access to sperm banks, fertility clinics, and child adoption. Page 1.</p>

<p>Controversial Independent Senator Mal Colston, under investigation for allegedly abusing his parliamentary allowances, has given a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal, asking for an increase in salary in his position as Deputy President of the Senate, citing increased job responsibilities.

<p>THE AGE</p>
<p>A move by Victorian Auditor-General Ches Baragwanath and his staff to conduct a special audit on the Metropolitan Ambulance Service was the first sign that there were possible over-payments and breaches of guidelines for awarding contracts. Before this, financial audit by one of the 'big six' private accounting firms failed to publicly query the possible overpayments that are now the subject of a police investigation. Page 1.</p>

<p>Mother of two Margaret Bowen was able to save the lives of her two daughters as her home on David Street was engulfed in flames at around 1am yesterday, but after guiding the girls out of the home through a bedroom window, she inexplicably turned back into the flames. Page 1.</p>

<p>A leaked Victorian Government document shows State councils face bills of up to A$22 million each year because of a blowout in their unfunded superannuation liabilities. The analysis, prepared as part of a Finance Department salvage package, shows the predicted black hole will be around A$466 million, A$130 million more than admitted by the Government. Page 1.</p>

<p>Authorities in Western Australia raised the alarm for Melbourne-based smallgoods maker Don Smallgoods to withdraw processed meat products after salmonella was found in batches of liver spread and kabana. Page 1.</p>
