<p>Polish shares inched up despite the central bank's Friday announcement it would raise interest rates on Monday but analysts saw a flat or down market on Tuesday with the bourse maintaining its slight downtrend.</p>
<p>On Monday the lombard rate went up by two points to 27 percent and the discount rate by 2.5 points to 24.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise was discounted earlier, especially as market rates rose, and the (downward) reaction of some banks seems more like speculation on the news,&quot; said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Bank Pekao SA brokerage.</p>
<p>Bank Slaski fell 9.9 percent on Monday, BRE 8.2 percent, the latter's fall followed by stronger buying after price fixing. BIG, which said after the session that it would raise its credit rates, held flat.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index rose 0.2 percent to 15,148.8 points and turnover fell 22.9 percent to 127.3 million zlotys ($36.6 million) on both markets. Gainers led losers by 77 to 15 with 15 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market would likely continue its slight downtrend in the run-up to September's parliamentary elections and in the continuing uncertainty on damages caused by recent flooding, seen in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Some analysts were surprised paintmaker Polifarb Wroclaw fell only 2.4 percent the day it resumed trade after its suspension since July 11 due to flooding.</p>
<p>The firm incurred 11.6 million zlotys ($3.3 million) in damage, which it said was covered by insurance, and lowered its 1997 net profit forecast by 10.2 percent.</p>
<p>Builder Budimex down 7.7 percent, continued its plunge on late July's news it revised down its its 1997 profit view, but saw strong buying after price fixing.</p>
