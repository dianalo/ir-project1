<p>Indonesian police have arrested two employees of the National Museum following investigations into the theft of 12 paintings from the national collection, the Jakarta Post newspaper reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>National police chief Lieutenant-General Dibyo Widodo told reporters that the two staff members, identified only by the initials S and B, had been arrested a few days ago.</p>
<p>They are among nine suspects wanted by police, he said, adding that the other seven were in hiding.</p>
<p>The paper quoted an unidentified police source as saying the suspects, some of who were said to occupy important positions at the museum, had fled their homes after the theft was made public when the stolen paintings were offered for auction in Singapore.</p>
<p>Christies auction house withdrew the paintings from the sale. They are to be returned to Indonesia.</p>
