<p>Expenditures that prompted a federal probe of the Port of Miami were made with money belonging to the private firm that runs the seaport cargo cranes, and not with public funds, company owner Calvin Grigsby said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not a dime that we've spent that was county money,&quot; Grigsby told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Grigsby is president of the California investment banking firm Grigsby &amp; Associates and also owns Fiscal Operations Inc, which manages the giant gantry cranes at the Port of Miami.</p>
<p>Under court order, the firm provided 26 boxes of company records last week to Dade County, which operates the seaport.</p>
<p>The records indicate seaport revenues were spent on Super Bowl tickets, campaign contributions to Dade County commissioners, charity golf tournaments, luxury car leases, yacht maintenance and other expenses unrelated to the port.</p>
<p>The revelation prompted port Director Carment Lunetta, who approved the company's budget, to suddenly announce his retirement.</p>
<p>A county commissioner, Miriam Alanso, also confirmed Wednesday the U.S. Attorney's Office is investigating Lunetta's relationship with the company and its operations.</p>
<p>Grigsby said the crane company's contract with Dade County calls for it to receive &quot;in the $4 to $5 million range&quot; this year, in 12 monthly payments.</p>
<p>&quot;We collect the user fees, and the agreement provides that we keep one-twelfth of our management fee (the monthly payment) The rest automatically goes to the county,&quot; Grigsby said.</p>
<p>Grigsby said all the expenses that have been questioned were made with the share of seaport revenues that his firm was entitled to keep.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider it our money our that we get paid because it's a contract price. We don't consider it county money,&quot; Grigsby said. &quot;There's nothing wrong with a private company doing that (making such expenditures). You look at any Fortune 500 company and they're taking private jets to go play golf.&quot;</p>
<p>Grigsby acknowledged a county auditor's assertion that Fiscal Operations owes Dade County $24 million.</p>
<p>He said about $9 million of the debt is money his company owed to the port for ground rental fees for the first two cranes at the port, which his company owned before selling them to the county in 1988.</p>
<p>The county agreed to defer the payments and is charging the firm interest, which accounts for the rest of the $24 million, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not taxpayers' money,&quot; Grigsby said. &quot;If they had owned the cranes themselves, they would not have collected any ground lease rentals.&quot;</p>
<p>Grigsby said that during the time his company owned the cranes, the county collected docking and wharfage fees from the shipping companies that used them.</p>
<p>&quot;They made way more than he did,&quot; Grigsby said.</p>
<p>He did not address the county external auditor's statement that Fiscal Operations was unable to repay the money.</p>
<p>But Grigsby said the county had routinely reviewed his firm's records and did not raise any objections.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody kept telling us what a great job we're doing,&quot; Grigsby said. &quot;Every year they reviewed our books. We've always given the county our records. There's nothing new that they've got.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know the hoopla is about the fact that I've been investigated in Operation Green Palm,&quot; Grigsby added.</p>
<p>Operation Green Palm is the ongoing federal investigation of public finance corruption in Miami and Dade County. Three Miami officials have already resigned to face bribery and kickback charges.</p>
<p>According to the Miami Herald, the FBI secretly taped a meeting in which Grigsby discussed giving a Dade County commissioner a kickback in exchange for steering bond business to Grigsby's municipal underwriting firm.</p>
<p>Grigsby declined to discuss that investigation but he and the commissioner have both denied wrongdoing.</p>
