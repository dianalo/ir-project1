<p>The United States said on Wednesday it was no longer committed to protecting the ethnic &quot;safe haven&quot; set up in northern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War and announced it was leaning toward airlifting thousands of Kurds from the area.</p>
<p>CIA Director John Deutch told Congress he expected renewed inter-Kurdish fighting which could bring to blows Iraq and Iran, historic foes that have backed rival Kurdish factions.</p>
<p>In testimony before the House International Relations Committee, the State Department's top policy-maker on Iraq faulted the rival Kurdish groups for giving President Saddam Hussein the opportunity to interfere in their decades-old disputes.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no commitment to protect them against their own bad judgment if one party invites Saddam Hussein in&quot; to help it against the other, Robert Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, said.</p>
<p>Pressed by Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, the panel's ranking Democrat, on whether the administration was committed to defending a Kurdish enclave in the north from feared Iraqi repression, Pelletreau replied: &quot;That has not been the policy of this administration.&quot;</p>
<p>He acknowledged that George Bush, Clinton's predecessor, &quot;may have&quot; vowed to protect the Kurds in an enclave north of the 36th parallel. The area is one of two broad belts in Iraq where U.S. and allied warplanes patrol to keep Iraqi aircraft from making overflights.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Glynn Davies said no decision had been made yet on the possible evacuation of thousands more Kurds, but &quot;it is our inclination to do this if we can.&quot;</p>
<p>The people in question worked for private groups that helped supply the Kurdish enclave in the north. Earlier this month, the United States evacuated to the Pacific island of Guam via Turkey 2,100 Kurds who had been employed by the United States in the area, along with family members.</p>
<p>Davies said the possible new evacuation would involve &quot;thousands&quot; more Kurds. &quot;We do believe there are credible threats to this second group of people,&quot; he said, declining to elaborate.</p>
<p>Deutch, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, predicted that the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which has recently allied itself with Iran, would seek to retake areas it lost after Saddam intervened on Aug. 31 to help the rival Kurdish Democratic Party capture the town of Arbil.</p>
<p>&quot;I do believe that we should anticipate some PUK efforts, at one level or another with Iranian assistance, to try to regain part of its territory,&quot; Deutch told the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not necessarily the case, but it might well be the case that a PUK incursion is immediately met by a reintroduction of Iraqi forces in the north,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States fired 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi military targets and enlarged the no-fly zone in southern Iraq this month after Saddam sent troops into the quasi-autonomous Kurdish zone to back the Kurdish Democratic Party of Massoud Barzani.</p>
<p>Pelletreau said the United States had never given any thought to &quot;protecting the Kurds against themselves ... when their internal rivalries spill over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our policy objective on Iraq is constant: to deter the threat the Iraqi regime poses to the peace and security of a region of vital national interest to the United States,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States, France and Britain offered protection to Kurds after the U.N. Security Council in 1991 passed Resolution 688 calling on Iraq not to repress minorities such as the Kurds in the north and Shiite Moslems in the south.</p>
