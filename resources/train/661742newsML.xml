<p>Papua New Guinea went to the polls on Saturday to judge a government that earlier this year attempted to put down a rebellion with mercenaries.</p>
<p>Campaigning was marked by some protests and clashes but electoral officials said there had been no reports of trouble as the two weeks of voting began.</p>
<p>About 5,000 police and 450 soldiers have been dispersed around the country where elections are taken so seriously that 80 percent or more of the largely illiterate 3.4 million voters turn out.</p>
<p>&quot;Reports from the police indicate that voting is going smoothly,&quot; Deputy Electoral Commissioner Michael Malabug told Reuters.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea, off the north coast of Australia, plunged into crisis in March after the government of Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan hired mercenaries through a British-based consultancy to suppress a rebellion on the copper-rich island of Bougainville.</p>
<p>The contract was the last straw for the security forces, which mutinied.</p>
<p>Senior army officers said they were fed up with maladministration and corruption and called for the government to resign.</p>
<p>Civilians rioted for two days before Chan finally stepped aside as prime minister.</p>
<p>A record 2,368 candidates -- 1,665 of them independents -- are standing in the election, Papua New Guinea's fifth since independence from Australia in 1975.</p>
<p>The two-week election period allows voters from the remote highlands to travel to polling stations.</p>
<p>Another week has been set aside for counting and the the new government will be formed after parliament is sworn in on July 15.</p>
<p>A nationwide liquor ban and dusk-to-dawn curfew have also been imposed.</p>
