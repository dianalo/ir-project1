<p>Five Yemeni opposition parties have called on the government to revoke this week's increase in the price of petrol, wheat and flour, warning the rises could cause social unrest.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent increase in prices of basic goods and previous similar measures will lead to the destruction of the citizens' standard of living and will cause great damage to public stability...and social peace,&quot; the parties said in a statement received by Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>The five parties include the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), which boycotted the country's April elections but is traditionally a key political force. Some of the YSP's leaders launched a secessionist bid which sparked a 1994 civil war.</p>
<p>The statement called for the cancellation of all price increases announced since July 1, saying the parties would hold the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh responsible for any related unrest and damage to the public interest.</p>
<p>Yemen on Tuesday raised wheat and flour prices by around 14 percent in line with recommendations by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, only a few hours after the oil ministry raised petrol prices over 31 percent.</p>
<p>When Yemen last increased the price of petrol in January 1996, farmers and students took to the streets and blocked a major Sanaa-Aden highway in protest.</p>
<p>In 1995, riots erupted in the southern port city of Aden over the doubling of petrol prices. ($1=125 rials)</p>
