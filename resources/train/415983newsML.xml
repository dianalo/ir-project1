<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan to halt passengers' flight, delay protests.</title>
<headline>Taiwan to halt passengers' flight, delay protests.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-03-03</dateline>

<p>Taiwan's civil aviation chief vowed on Monday to end a practice of some Taiwan passengers who, hoping to win financial compensation for flight delays, refuse to leave their seats.</p>
<p>&quot;In the near future, any passengers refusing to leave will be removed forcibly from planes by law enforcers,&quot; Civil Aeronautic Administration chief Tsai Duoi told parliament.</p>
<p>Northwest Airlines, United Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Taiwan carrier China Airlines had complained that an apparently growing number of Taiwan passengers were resorting to such action, Tsai said.</p>
<p>Tsai said U.S. officials had lodged a similar complaint to him during recent negotiations in Washington leading to Taiwan's acceptance of the U.S.-inspired &quot;open skies&quot; agreement.</p>
<p>Typically, a passenger angry over a delay simply refuses to disembark at the destination and demands cash compensation.</p>
<p>Such protests stalled six airliners on February 26 alone when fog closed Taiwan's international airport, Tsai said.</p>
<p>Airlines say most delays are unavoidable, involving bad weather, airport congestion or other safety factors.</p>
<p>A Cathay spokeswoman contacted by Reuters acknowledged that the Hong Kong carrier had paid such compensation once, but subsequently had refused similar demands.</p>
<p>Saying the practice was hurting Taiwan's reputation, Tsai said his agency would work out regulations over the next two months to deal with disputes between passengers and airlines.</p>
