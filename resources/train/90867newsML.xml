<p>Mexican stocks shot up for the second day in a row on Wednesday, as foreigners flooded the market ahead of third-quarter earnings reports, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Company earnings will not be good across the board, but I expect some sectors to offer investors a favorable outlook. The market is now beginning to discount this,&quot; a New York-based equity analyst said.</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC index closed a hefty 71.84 points up, or 2.19 percent, at 3,358.32. Volume was much improved on recent sessions at a heavy 103.8 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>Traders said that falling domestic and U.S. interest rates and gains in the Dow Jones boosted the Bolsa.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bolsa's outlook improved dramatically. Then buying just snowballed. Prices were also a give-away,&quot; said a trader from the Abaco brokerage.</p>
<p>Benchmark 28-day Cetes had fallen to 23.06 percent, down 22 basis points from last week, at Tuesday's primary auction. The Dow Jones meanwhile closed 29.07 points up, or 0.49 percent, at 5,933.97. U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yields stood at 6.84 percent.  </p>
<p>As opposed to many recent sessions, blue chips dominated the percentage gainers list, lead by bank stock Intenal B series, up 52 centavos to 5.60 pesos. Traders said this was due to speculation that the bank was about to raise capital.</p>
<p>Comerci B series, from the hard-hit retail sector, was in second place, having gained 50 centavos to 7.50 pesos.</p>
<p>A total of 117 stocks were traded on the broad market, of which gainers easily outnumbered losers by 79 to 23, with the remaining 15 unchanged.</p>
