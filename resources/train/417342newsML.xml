<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other on Tuesday of massing weapons along a ceasefire line separating them and said the build-up could ignite new fighting over disputed territory after a three-year truce.</p>
<p>Azeri Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov told parliament in Baku that Armenia had obtained missile systems capable of carrying out a nuclear attack on his country.</p>
<p>&quot;These rockets have a radius of 300 km (190 miles) and can be equipped with nuclear warheads,&quot; he told deputies. He did not name the missile systems.</p>
<p>An Azeri Defence Ministry official claimed the rockets were shipped to Armenia from Russia during the last two years, and that they had a long enough range to hit the capital Baku.</p>
<p>A Russian cabinet minister said last month that heavy armour, including tanks and combat vehicles, had been &quot;illegally&quot; supplied to Armenia in 1994-96.</p>
<p>Deputy Security Minister Galip Haligov said Yerevan had also taken delivery of 1,000 &quot;Strela&quot; shoulder-mounted, anti-aircraft systems from Russia. The Strela is a Russian-made version of the U.S.-made &quot;Stinger&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;These new weapon deliveries could lead to the resumption of hostilities and lead to the destabilisation of the situation in the Transcaucasus,&quot; said Hasanov.</p>
<p>Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan countered by saying Azerbaijan was staging a build-up of arms along the tense border between the two countries.</p>
<p>He urged &quot;increased contacts&quot; with Azerbaijan &quot;so that tension does not grow into violations of the truce&quot;.</p>
<p>Christian Armenia and Moslem Azerbaijan have been embroiled in a nine-year conflict over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated by ethnic Armenians but surrounded by Azeri territory.</p>
<p>More than 15,000 people were killed in a war over the region before a ceasefire was declared in 1994 after Armenia made massive territorial gains.</p>
<p>Peace talks, mediated by Russia and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), are deadlocked and the prospects for a settlement seem as remote as ever.</p>
<p>Aman Tuleev, Russian Minister for Cooperation with Countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said last month that 84 T-72 tanks and 50 infantry combat vehicles had been transferred from Russia to Armenia between 1994-96.</p>
<p>Armenia denies having received the weapons.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan has loudly criticised the alleged shipments as a violation of the ceasefire and says they destroy Russia's credibility as a mediator in the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>Haligov said the flow of arms from Russia, which included the Strela rockets, was continuing. He said they were being shipped from Russia across the Caspian Sea and through Iran, before going over land to Armenia.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Azeri President Haydar Aliyev and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan said the two leaders held a rare telephone conversation on Monday evening and that both pledged to continue to seek a peaceful settlement on Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
