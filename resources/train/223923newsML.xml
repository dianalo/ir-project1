<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices on Thursday were assessed firm on the fall in Singapore residue stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>Singapore weekly residue stocks plunged 1.158 million barrels to 9.801 million barrels.</p>
<p>Traders said the fall in fuel oil stocks were indicative that China has been covering most of its supplies from Singapore in place of South Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea exports of high sulphur fuel oil has been limited in December as refiners there were running more low sulphur crude resulting in increased production of low sulphur fuel oil in place of high sulphur fuel oil.</p>
<p>High sulphur, 180 centistoke fuel oil was quoted at $121/$123 per tonne on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Late Thrusday, an offer was seen at $126 per tonne.</p>
<p>But a local trader said current prices were overpriced, citing support from a few players.</p>
<p>He assessed prices should range between $117-$120 per tonne.</p>
<p>In the swaps market, December was quoted at $118.75/$119.50 unchanged from Wednesday quotes.</p>
