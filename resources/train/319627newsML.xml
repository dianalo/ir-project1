<p>Jacques Calvet, the chairman of French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen and a longtime critic of the European drive to establish a single currency, said in an interview that the project was doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Calvet said it looked likely that the euro would be established on schedule in 1999. &quot;But I think after that -- three months or 18 months later, who knows -- there will be a collapse of the single currency in the way we're establishing it,&quot; he told the French newspaper La Tribune.</p>
<p>&quot;Europeans say they are convinced that it's impossible to arrive at a political and unitary vision of Europe, that it's important to begin from a technical basis and to hide from people the fact that we're constructing a political entity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;With this approach, any effort is doomed to failure,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope the euro will not be created on January 1, 1999, because my view is that, under those conditions, it won't survive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's clear that the problems are more complicated than we'd envisaged,&quot; he said, but added that the PSA group was preparing for the change in its data systems, accounting and other financial activities.</p>
