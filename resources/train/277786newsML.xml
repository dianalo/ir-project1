<title>PERU: Japan sends two defense agency personnel to Lima.</title>

<dateline>LIMA 1996-12-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japan has sent two national defence agency officials to Lima to join its foreign ministry task force handling the hostage crisis, Japanese officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Officials here declined to reveal the names, ranks or job descriptions of the two and would not say whether they were civilian or military personnel.</p>
<p>The officials would only say that the two defence agency officials would be gathering information on the 10-day-old hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>Under the post-war pacifist constitution, Japan bans any overseas military action by its 240,000-member armed forces, known as the Self Defence Forces (SDF).</p>
<p>The two officials arrived in Lima on Thursday and were under the command of the task force, set up by Tokyo since the Marxist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) stormed the residence of Japanese ambassador Morihisa Aoki during a cocktail party on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>The guerrillas were still holding 103 hostages, including Aoki and about 30 other Japanese nationals -- among them diplomats and senior businessmen from multinational companies.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry officials in Lima denied that Japanese companies with employees among the hostages have received ransom demands from the MRTA. They said it was also their understanding that no such demands had been received in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not heard anything at all about ransom demands,&quot; a senior official said.</p>
<p>He said the government also had no plans to ask the businesses not to pay any ransoms.</p>
