<text>
<p>East and Central European bourses were in bearish mood at the end of the week as a round of profit-taking hit the markets following steep gains since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Some analysts said comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on a possibility of higher U.S. interest rates might also have tempered international players' appetite for emerging market stocks.</p>
<p>Warsaw, Prague and Bratislava were lower, Budapest edged up but late losses pushed it off two-year highs, Croatian shares stabilised and Romanian and Slovenian shares were the only ones to buck the trend.</p>
<p>PRAGUE</p>
<p>Blue chip gains pushed the Prague bourse to a two-year high by Tuesday but it promptly retreated as a round of profit-taking gained momentum by the close of Thursday's session.</p>
<p>The PX50 index, which had shot up over 16 percent this year, closed on Thursday at 613.6, down 11.8 points, or 1.89 percent over the week.</p>
<p>Leading the bourse lower were its three biggest issues -- SPT Telecom a.s., power utility CEZ a.s. and Komercni Banka a.s. -- sharply down in profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a thin market and when you see a little profit-taking ...the market kind of collapses,&quot; said Jan Sykora of Wood and Company. &quot;I am afraid that the trend will probably continue.&quot;</p>
<p>WARSAW</p>
<p>The Warsaw bourse fell 1.7 percent this week and analysts saw more profit-taking after the bourse's 30 percent rise since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Some analysts said Greenspan's comments might have helped spark the long-expected correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Greenspan's warning provoked the profit-taking as domestic investors fear that big ones will pull out and global players could close their positions here while limiting their overall equity exposure,&quot; said Remigiusz Tarka of IB Austria.</p>
<p>Some analysts saw the WIG index, which closed on Thursday at 17,824.4, losing up to 10 percent more before any rebound.</p>
<p>BUDAPEST</p>
<p>Hungarian shares posted slight gains in light trade in the first half of the week on impetus from a strong dollar but lost some ground on Thursday following Greenspan's remarks and in the absence of fresh fundamental factors.</p>
<p>Traders said many buyers sat on their hands, fearing a rise in U.S. rates, which would cool international markets and spill over onto the Budapest bourse, which is dominated by foreign players.</p>
<p>&quot;Bourses have become a little uncertain following the Greenspan comments,&quot; said Peter Lencs of MKB securities. &quot;Investors think U.S. interest rates may go up and we will feel that on the Hungarian bourse.&quot;</p>
<p>BRATISLAVA</p>
<p>Major Slovak shares failed to extend last week's gains as they crawled to new year highs on Monday and Wednesday in thin volumes but then retreated to close 0.24 percent lower on Thursday. The 16-share SAX index dropped 0.49 points to 201.71.</p>
<p>Brokers said continued demand for the most heavily- weighted issues, such as oil refiner Slovnaft or steel maker VSZ, should help the bourse resume its advance.</p>
<p>Some dealers, however, said the bourse had risen for too long and was now vulnerable to profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Low liquidity remains the main problem but we also desperately need strong market-makers quoting both sides to give it fundamental grounds for a stronger trend,&quot; said Radovan Dzugas of Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>ZAGREB</p>
<p>Croatian stocks took a dip on Thursday as trade picked up after a slower start to the week and traders saw the trend continuing in the near term.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were on the lookout for new stocks as blue chips Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka were losing steam and some singled out the Varazdinska and Dalmatinska banks as likely to buck the trend.</p>
<p>BUCHAREST</p>
<p>Heavy trading in Bucharest first-tier stocks Oltchim chemical plant and fertiliser maker Azomures kept session turnover at above two billion lei and pushed two market indices to all-time highs on Thursday.</p>
<p>Most other share prices drifted higher due to low supply.</p>
<p>LJUBLJANA</p>
<p>Slovenian shares firmed 0.71 percent by Thursday's close as the blue-chip SBI index rose 9.88 points to 1,394.91.</p>
<p>Brokerage Primofin was the biggest gainer, jumping nine percent, while the leading loser was construction company GPG, down 30.65 percent.</p>
