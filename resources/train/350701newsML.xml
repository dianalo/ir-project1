<p>South Africa's Sanlam life assurance corporation is shrugging off the financial burdens of the apartheid era, says Hendrik Bester, managing director-designate of embryonic Sanlam Asset Managment.</p>
<p>&quot;We're more and more focusing our investment activities on portfolio investors and not necessarily on socially desirable investments,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We're no longer obligated that, being a big institution, we have to do certain things as we did in the past with our strategic holdings.&quot;</p>
<p>Bester, currently senior general manager, investments, will oversee assets totalling more than 140 billion rand, encouraging portfolio managers to be more flexible than many have come to expect from one of the country's foremost Afrikaner-led institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past, it was an obligation that Sanlam took upon itself in the days of disinvestment. Strategically, we thought it was important because we were locked up in this country to become involved in a major way, investment wise.</p>
<p>&quot;Where we see the world going, we don't think that is required of us anymore. We think we can be much better at asset management by just looking at investment considerations and not being locked up into strategic holdings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sanlam Asset Management was formed officially on January 1, but appointments, priorities and other details have yet to be confirmed by Sanlam chairman Marinus Daling's board.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't see the asset management shift in isolation. You should see that as part of the total Sanlam, shifting more towards financial services, with less concentration purely on life assurance,&quot; Bester said.</p>
<p>Daling told the Financial Times last September that Sanlam, currently a mutual life insurer, might seek a listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange within three to four years.</p>
<p>The shift in emphasis from investments designed to bolster an embattled economy and a ruling Afrikaner minority to portfolio-driven strategies is in line with the group's long-term plan.</p>
<p>Head of portfolio management Dries du Toit said the new structure would allow his team to be more responsive.</p>
<p>&quot;We are unbundling, getting black partners and getting international partners. We're building down to acceptable portfolio size.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be less locked in than before. We will have greater freedom because of the building down of those strategic invesments.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot run a mining house. We cannot run a retail organisation. Gone are the days when we wanted to have a finger in every pie. That's history,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Du Toit said the new ethos, emphasized by men in open-necked shirts rather than suits, would be bolstered by more aggressive personnel management.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is accountable. If you perform well, you'll get more than your traditional 13th cheque at the end of the year. We're becoming more and more performance oriented in our remuneration package,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sanlam's social role is being delegated in part to the group's two development funds, one investing in black-owned or controlled listed companies with current assets of close to one billion rand and the other in smaller initiatives.</p>
<p>&quot;Our black empowerment deals have been done on an economic basis and they've all done better than expected,&quot; Du Toit said.</p>
