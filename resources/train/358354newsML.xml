<headline>Helsinki rolls to all-time high in broad rally.</headline>

<p>Shares powered to a new all-time high close on Wednesday after a broad-based rally sparked by overnight gains in U.S. stocks, with Nokia up and lively but off highs, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX index added more than 27 points to end at 2,796.76, topping its previous best from January 23 with volume a hefty 740 million markka, about one-third of it in Nokia. Finance shares outperformed, ending up more than two percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a strong market with no threats in sight and with domestic economic fundamentals favourable,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Others added bullishness was grounded partly on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates at its FOMC meeting on Wednesday, and said sentiment should remain buoyant as the reporting season warms up.</p>
<p>Nokia ended 4.50 higher at 325.50, but off a session high of 329.00.</p>
<p>Crane maker Konecranes rose sharply after it reported preliminary 1996 earnings above analysts' expectations. It rose 18.00 markka, up more than 11 percent, to 180.00 in heavy 39 million markka turnover.</p>
<p>Merita led financials up, adding 0.40 markka to end at 16.80, but off an intraday best 16.90. Trade was fair, rising above 20 million markka.</p>
<p>Against the trend, insurer Sampo fell 19.50 markka to 420.00 on profit-taking after recent sharp gains and on news of a NatWest downgrade from hold to reduce, brokers said.</p>
