<headline>OPTIONS - Dlr/mark vols stay aloft, await Buba.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-19</dateline>

<p>Dollar/mark option implied volatilities stayed firm, with persistent bid at the front end keeping the volatility curve inverted as the market awaited Thursday's Bundesbank policy council meeting, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as the dollar is bid, front end vols are going to be bid,&quot; said a German bank dealer in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar briefly reclaimed the 1.70 mark level early in the afternoon before retreating slightly.</p>
<p>Implied volatility for one-month dollar/mark was up about a quarter point from late Tuesday levels to 9.65/9.85 percent in late U.S. trading. One-year was up 0.1 to 9.7/9.9 percent.  </p>
<p>News of the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had negligible impact on the market, although it was mildly supportive of dollar/yen, traders added.</p>
<p>They said his death had been long anticipated and was unlikely to cause political instability in China. Still, they noted some concern about how Far Eastern traders would react on Thursday.</p>
<p>The dollar rose steadily against the yen in U.S. trading to the mid-124 yen area, within striking distance of last Friday's 124.82 yen high.  </p>
<p>&quot;Actual volatility has come down, just as the G7 (Group of Seven industrial countries) ordered, but the dollar has been hanging around at very spooky levels,&quot; said Masao Okada, chief options dealer at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. &quot;That's keeping volatilities from sliding.&quot;</p>
<p>Dollar/yen volatilities were roughly unchanged from late Tuesday levels, with one-month at 10.8/11.1 percent and one-year at 11.2/11.3 percent.</p>
<p>Okada said dealers in general were becoming more sensitive about their vega risk than gamma as implied volatilities stayed firm despite a range-bound spot.  </p>
<p>Shorter-dated options have more gamma, or premium acceleration on spot market swings, and also more time-decay. Longer-dated options have more vega, the rate of premium movement per change in volatility level.</p>
<p>Okada noted that interbank dealers were generally short low-delta options because of end-user buying of the out-of-the-money options and various hedging activities linked to exotic options.</p>
<p>Although they would usually hedge that by going long at-the-money options, that still creates negative vega exposure in a high-volatility environment, he said.  </p>
<p>With a steady spot, at-the-money options see little change of characteristics. But as volatility level creeps up, the out-of-the-money options will see their delta -- and therefore vega, gamma and other values -- increase.</p>
<p>Should the spot dollar resume its bull run against the yen, the market was likely to see some exaggerated volatility, Okada added.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, volatilities for sterling and the European crosses were mostly steady as spot rates stayed away from sensitive levels. Mark/lira's inability to rise above 1,000 lire prompted volatilities to retreat from early highs.</p>
