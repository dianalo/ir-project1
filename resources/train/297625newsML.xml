<title>GERMANY: German cocoa grind partly reflects plant shifts.</title>

<p>German cocoa traders said a 21.2 percent fall in fourth quarter 1996 bean grindings was partly the result of shifts of processing capacity at the Hamester group between Berlin and Hamburg.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard capacity shifts have not run as smoothly as expected but the production losses should be temporary,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;The German grind figure is not overly crucial to the market and might be offset by the higher Dutch figure and what many believe will be a good British result,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But traders said the figure was surprisingly low -- after analysts forecast a two percent decline.</p>
<p>The confectionery industry association BDS put the fourth quarter 1996 grind at 56,254.7 tonnes after 71,375.0 tonnes in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>The full year 1996 figure stands at 251,069.4 tonnes, down three percent from 1995.</p>
<p>BDS managing director Karsten Keunecke cited possible changes in European bean import flows but would not comment further on the discrepancy between the forecast and the result.</p>
<p>&quot;All companies have put in their reports and this is the final figure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said operators across Europe were shifting capacity across borders and there was also a lot of talk about plans by international groups to boost processing at origin.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to start looking at pan-European chocolate consumption and become less focused on national grind results because they no longer tell the whole story,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Physical cocoa markets here were subdued because of lacking fundamentals news and as manufacturers shied away from higher mark prices as a result of a firm sterling/mark ratio.</p>
<p>First quarter cif Ivorian bean prices were unchanged from levels before the Christmas and New Year holidays at 2.26 marks per kg, but buyers' price ideas were around 2.20.</p>
<p>The cocoa butter ratio was also unchanged at 2.68, with implied prices ex-works at 6.21 marks per kg versus 6.32 marks before the year-end break, with buyers at 6.10 marks.</p>
