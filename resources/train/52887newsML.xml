<p>Singapore oil products market saw gas oil gasoline continued to rally on Friday, while fuel oil remained steady despite the excitement over rising tensions in the Gulf, traders said.</p>
<p>The Gulf conflict and the coming peak demand period compounded gas oil's rise. Traders expect it to test a five-year high as a Singapore trader offered at $28.90 for 220,000 barrels lifting end September 1 to October 1. A major bid for a smaller cargo at $28.00 for September 30-October lifting. The highest physical deal was done in February at $27.75. Paper rose with deals at $28.80-$28.90 up from Thursday's $28.25.  </p>
<p>Offers into India's tender to buy 0.25 percent sulphur diesel for October lifting ranged between $2.50-$2.90 a barrel over MidEast quotes, c+f West Coast.</p>
<p>Jet fuel also maintained its strength with two refiners offering for end-September-early October cargoes at $31.00 with no bids seen.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices hit four-year highs with October cargoes just below $22 a barrel. But levels have yet to reach the high of $27.55 recorded in June 1992. Traders said north Asian petrochemical turnarounds slowed October and November demand, capping prices and keeping levels &quot;cheap relative to crude&quot;.  </p>
<p>October swaps rose to $21.30/$21.40 up 15 cents. Gasoline was bid up again with levels for 50,000 barrels  of 95-octane unleaded rising within the day from $22.65 to $22.90 for October 1-5, and from $23.10 to $23.30 for September 27-October 1 lifting.</p>
<p>Traders were mixed over near-term fuel oil price direction despite firm paper quotes and crude gains. Chinese traders said demand from China for October barrels were likely to rise. They said previous low imports for August and September have reduced local stocks. Chinese bids were heard between $120 and $125, traders said. --Singapore Newsroom (+65-870 3084)</p>
