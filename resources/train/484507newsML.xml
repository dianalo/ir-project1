<p>The judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case on Thursday rejected pleas to open closed-door meetings on jury selection even though he said every judge should be subjected to public scrutiny.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch and the opposing attorneys are questioning people in open court as they try to select a jury to sit in judgment on Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh, accused of the April 19, 1995, attack on the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>But the judge and attorneys also meet daily behind closed doors to decide which jurors to excuse for specific reasons -- decisions that have not been made public.</p>
<p>Media lawyer Tom Kelley the daughter told the judge the public's interest in the case demanded that the closed-door meetings be shifted to open court.</p>
<p>Matsch agreed there was &quot;no question that there is a strong public interest in knowing how the process is functioning and how the judge is ruling. The judge ... should be subject to public scrutiny.&quot;</p>
<p>But he rejected Kelley's request because of concerns about juror security and the court's ability to select an impartial jury. He also said he did not want prospective jurors to read news reports of how a person might be excused from serving.</p>
<p>He said he would unseal the proceedings at a later date.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City bomb blast, the worst mass murder in U.S. history, has generated intense media coverage.</p>
<p>Citizens' views on capital punishment dominated the fourth day of jury selection. McVeigh could face execution if found guilty and jurors must be prepared to hand down a death sentence if the evidence justifies it.</p>
<p>A librarian was questioned only briefly by attorneys after she said she was totally opposed to capital punishment for personal reasons. She said she believed that, if chosen, she would be under so much pressure she would have to say she did not believe in the death penalty. &quot;I don't want to be placed in a jury where I'd have to make this choice,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Although her views are likely to disqualify her, Matsch followed his usual practice, telling her: &quot;You must act as if you are going to be on the jury in spite of these views.&quot;</p>
<p>The librarian was followed in the jury box by a nurse who kept the court guessing about her views on the death penalty. She told a prosecutor that when a person does wrong &quot;only God can take their life from them,&quot; but when questioned more closely by Matsch she said that, &quot;if it comes down to it,&quot; she would vote for the death penalty.</p>
<p>Pressed by Matsch if she would be violating God's laws, she replied: &quot;God would have to judge me when my time comes.&quot;</p>
<p>Another nurse, who had asked to be excused from jury duty because she was worried about her four children, said she might not be able to pay close attention to the trial if she were preoccupied with her children. Matsch said he would make an exception and tell her on Friday if she had been excused.</p>
<p>The jury selection process has moved slowly, with attorneys laboriously quizzing potential jurors on their attitudes and knowledge of the case. Twenty-three potential jurors have been questioned so far as the judge and lawyers try to narrow down the pool of 350 to a smaller group from which they will select 12 jurors and six alternates.</p>
<p>McVeigh is formally charged with the &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; and the murder of eight federal officials. A second defendant, his former Army buddy Terry Nichols, will be tried separately later. Both have pleaded not guilty.</p>
