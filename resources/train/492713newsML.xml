<p>Undeterred by comparisons with selling ice to Antarctica or sand to the Arabs, British dairy producers are vying for a bigger bite of France's cheese market.</p>
<p>The French are already so spoiled for choice, from creamy camemberts to green-veined roqueforts, that late president Charles de Gaulle once observed that a country producing 246 cheeses was ungovernable.</p>
<p>Touting cheeses with names like stinking bishop or Cornish yarg, British producers are hoping to add to the anarchic range of cheese in a land convinced it has the world's finest cuisine -- and widely convinced that much British food is foul.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand, it's like carrying coals to Newcastle. On the other we may have a chance because this is a very discerning market,&quot; said Stephen Fletcher of Ram Hall in England, who hopes to export his tangy ewe's milk cheeses.</p>
<p>British producers of cow, goat, sheep and even buffalo cheese point to the surprise success of British retailer Marks and Spencer in France -- it even sells plastic-wrapped fish and chips with vinegar, a typical British dish, in France.</p>
<p>&quot;We sold 125 tonnes of British cheese last year in our 20 shops,&quot; said M&amp;S spokeswoman Francoise Martin after the launch of the cheese export drive at the British embassy.</p>
<p>The company's cheese sales, mostly cheddar and stilton but also cheshire and red leicester, account for about 75 percent of tiny British cheese sales in France.</p>
<p>Britain has had other cultural upsets in Paris -- including the appointments last year of fashion designers John Galliano at Christian Dior or Alexander McQueen at Givenchy.</p>
<p>FROM CHALK TO CHEESE IN 30 YEARS</p>
<p>Michel Roux, a French chef who runs one of only four restaurants in Britain with three stars in the Michelin Guide, the gourmet's bible, said British cheeses had improved dramatically in recent decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty years ago in Britain there was no good cheese apart from stilton and cheddar. It all tasted like chalk,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But many new British cheeses are not gimmicky...If a French cheese master put it in his shop, he'd hit the jackpot,&quot; he said. &quot;There's also a snob factor -- the French like to try anything that's British, at least once.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said foreign cheese producers faced the same problem as wine exporters from Australia, Chile, South Africa or California -- the French are convinced their products are best.</p>
<p>&quot;Many New World wines are excellent, but the French drink their own,&quot; said Roux, who runs the Waterside Inn in Berkshire, southern England.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes me a bit sick that I can't sell in France,&quot; said Robert Pouget, a Frenchman who lives in England and now wants to export his Oxford Blue cheese. &quot;One problem is that some mass-produced French blues aren't as expensive as mine.&quot;</p>
<p>French pride about cheese -- hard, gooey, crumbly or smelly -- stretches back a long way.</p>
<p>PLINY THE ELDER RAVED ABOUT FRENCH CHEESE</p>
<p>In the first century AD, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote that the most prized cheeses in Rome were from Nimes, the Lozere area or villages in Gevaudan. Historians believe he was referring to the ancestors of cantal and roquefort.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is the diversity of French cheeses,&quot; said Christian Le Gall of Z. Lanquetot, a wholesaler at the giant Rungis food market near Paris, who won a certificate from the British embassy for selling British cheese.</p>
<p>&quot;Any shop owner who sells British or other foreign cheeses will have to make space by taking away one of their existing cheeses. That's a tough decision,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he sold three tonnes of British cheese last year, a tiny fraction of the 1,500 tonnes of French cheese he sold, such as brie, comte, beaufort or munster.</p>
<p>France already consumes quantities of foreign cheese such as Swiss gruyere, Greek (and sometimes unwittingly Danish) feta, Dutch edam or Italian parmesan.</p>
<p>But with the notable exception of crumbly blue stilton, most British cheeses have yet to graduate from the mousetrap to the French gourmet's table.</p>
<p>Potential candidates for export to France include wensleydale -- mixed with ginger, cranberries or apricots -- cumberland, Yorkshire blue, tiskey meadow, sage derby, double gloucester or whisky cheddar.</p>
<p>British officials insisted cheese was not a backdoor way of rehabilitating British cattle in France, a year after the crisis over mad cow disease led to a worldwide ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>Dairy products have not been tied to the fatal brain disease.</p>
<p>Cheese has been made at least since the Stone Age in Britain. It got a boost from Cistercian monks who introduced their techniques about 1,000 years ago -- from France.</p>
