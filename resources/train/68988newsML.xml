<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) clampdown on illegal foreign workers will hit the south Indian state of Kerala harder than anywhere else in Asia, state government officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>State officials say about half the 50,000 to 60,000 Indians who will be forced out of the UAE are Malayalees, natives of Kerala, and 90 percent will be manual or semi-skilled labourers.</p>
<p>The UAE has given illegal workers, estimated at around 200,000 by diplomats there, a two-month amnesty to get their documents in order or quit the country by September 30.</p>
<p>So far only a trickle of workers have come back to their home state, as most have waited in vain for a change of heart from the UAE authorities, V. Venu, the head of the local government department for non-resident Indians, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He expected the numbers returning to swell markedly and said that most of them would be unskilled labourers.</p>
<p>The Indian government said on Friday it would ask national airlines to arrange extra flights from Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and arrange for ferries and ships to bring stranded nationals home.</p>
<p>Remittances home from Malayalees working in the Gulf now provide the economic mainstay of this lush-green state, best known for its exotic spices and tea and coffee plantations.</p>
<p>&quot;There should be around one million Malayalees working in the Gulf countries,&quot; Venu told Reuters.</p>
<p>The old spice route between Cochin port and the Arabian Peninsula had thrived for centuries, but when oil money arrived in the Gulf in the 1970s people became Kerala's main export.</p>
<p>Sociologists estimate that three in five families in this state of 30 million people at the southwest tip of the subcontinent have a relative working in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The money earned has mostly been spent on building new homes and consumer goods for their families.</p>
<p>The dependence on this flow of money back from the Gulf was clearly evident when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army occupied Kuwait in 1990. That caused a drastic slowdown in remittances and led to a crash in land prices in Kerala.</p>
<p>Kerala's chief minister E.K. Nayanar told Reuters in the state capital Trivandrum his government was putting together a seven billion rupee ($196 million) rehabilitation scheme for the welfare of people forced to come home by the UAE's new measures. He said central government help was needed.</p>
<p>The Times of India, in an editorial, also urged the New Delhi government to share the burden.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems the displaced face can already be seen in Kerala. The suicide rate has gone up as has alcohol and drug abuse, all of which have put a tremendous strain on the family, in particular, and society, in general,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Some of those coming back will be virtually destitute and disillusioned of any dreams of becoming wealthy with Gulf money.</p>
<p>Many will have paid agents large amounts of money, selling their land, to arrange travel, visas and jobs in the Gulf. And, unscrupulous agents will have given them forged papers and promises of non-existent jobs.</p>
<p>At first sea passage to the Gulf was the only option for many poor Keralites. They were often dropped off illegally, and left to wade or swim ashore to evade the authorities.</p>
<p>Now the air routes from Kerala to the Gulf are highly lucrative, providing Air India with some of its biggest revenue earners and the state's three main airports' livelihood depend on the Gulf bound traffic.</p>
