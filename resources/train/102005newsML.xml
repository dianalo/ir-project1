<title>CANADA: Canada's top general steps down.</title>
<headline>Canada's top general steps down.</headline>
<dateline>OTTAWA 1996-10-08</dateline>

<p>Canada's chief of defence staff, Gen. Jean Boyle, has resigned, Prime Minister Jean Chretien's office said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chretien said in a statement that he had &quot;accepted Gen. Boyle's request to relieve him of his duties.&quot; Boyle's resignation followed the resignation of Defence Minister David Collenette last Friday.  </p>
<p>Boyle and Collenette were engulfed in a scandal over an alleged cover-up of an incident involving Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia in 1992 and 1993 in which Canadian soldiers tortured and killed several Somalis.</p>
<p>Collenette had strongly backed Boyle even after the general admitted breaching the spirit of Canada's access-to-information laws over the incident.</p>
<p>Boyle was not chief of defence staff during the Somali incident but had been accused of involvement in the alleged cover-up. The Somali incident led to the disbanding of the elite Canadian Airborne Regiment.</p>
<p>A government-appointed inquiry is continuing into what has become known in Canada as the &quot;Somalia affair.&quot;</p>
