<p>Media and advertising industry representatives have blasted private television station Sat1 for staging a sponsored evening of programming without advertising, calling it a threat to the industry.</p>
<p>Although innovation in advertising is necessary, it is a mistake to suggest to viewers they can have television without ads, Hans Kratz, the chairman of the German Organisation of Advertising Media (OWM), said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are other ways to make oneself stand out that do not harm companies that advertise,&quot; Kratz said. &quot;This is absolutely the wrong way to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The concept is curious, downright absurd,&quot; said Helmut Thoma, the general manager of rival private network RTL, which on Thursday posted 3.2 billion marks in ad sales for 1996. &quot;RTL would certainly not broadcast such a night of programming.&quot;</p>
<p>Sat1 hailed its experiment with ad-free programming on Saturday evening a success, saying it had pulled in a 19.2 percent market share among viewers above the age of three, five points above its nearest competitor, public station ARD.</p>
<p>&quot;This event had a public relations effect,&quot; Sat1 marketing director Klaus-Peter Schulz said. &quot;We see it as our job to create the widest possible offering in the advertising-driven industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Brewer Kulmbacher Reichel Braeu AG sponsored the evening, the first of four scheduled &quot;Kulmbacher Film Nights&quot;, which featured three hit Hollywood films.</p>
