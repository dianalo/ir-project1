<p>Two soldiers and one guerrilla were killed this week in clashes between government troops and Khmer Rouge hardliners in northern Cambodia, a senior military officer said on Friday.</p>
<p>Armed forces deputy chief of staff Lieutenant-General Meas Sophea said fighting had raged over the government post of Ta Sec near the border with Thailand in Preah Vihear province.</p>
<p>The general, contacted by telephone, said hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas loyal to Ta Mok had taken the base but it was recaptured on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>The general said two government soldiers were killed and 11 wounded in the fighting, adding that one Khmer Rouge guerrilla was killed and five wounded.</p>
<p>Ta Mok, the feared one-legged commander, leads about 2,000 hardline Khmer Rouge guerrillas from the northern base of Anlong Veng and government negotiators have been trying to persuade his group to defect.</p>
<p>A team of 15 negotiators and air crew flew into territory controlled by the group on February 14 and have not returned, although they have been in radio contact with military officials in this northwest provincial capital.</p>
<p>First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh has said they are trying to negotiate more defections but his rival in Cambodia's uneasy coalition government, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, has said the team members have become hostages.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the fighting has affected negotiations with Ta Mok, one of the most notorious figures of the Khmer Rouge whose 1975-79 rule left more than one million people dead.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge reneged on a U.N.-brokered 1991 peace pact and has been fighting the coalition formed after 1993 elections.</p>
<p>The Maoist-inspired movement split last August and has since been crippled by thousands of defections, leaving only the Anlong Veng hardliners holding out. The government has said it wants a peaceful solution.</p>
