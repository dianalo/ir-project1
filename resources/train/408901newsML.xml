<p>Normandy Mining Ltd on Thursday welcomed Newcrest Mining Ltd's equity gold swap arrangement of its 11.9 percent Normandy stake, saying it was hard to see how the deal was bad for Normandy shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt it creates some surety,&quot; Normandy executive chairman Robert Champion de Crespigny told Reuters.</p>
<p>Newcrest said earlier it had sold its Normandy stake to the Australian and New Zealand Banking group (ANZ) for a gold equivalent of A$1.75 a share under a two-year equity-gold swap arrangement.  </p>
<p>Under the gold swap deal completed in late February, Newcrest said it would immediately receive the equivalent per-share value in gold, minus A$33 million which it would receive with interest in November this year.</p>
<p>Newcrest said it had the option but not an obligation to repurchase the shares from ANZ during the two-year period.</p>
<p>Newcrest bought the stake in Normandy in February 1996 in an unsuccessful attempt to merge with Normandy.</p>
<p>De Crespigny said Newcrest's wavering over what to do with its Normandy stake had not provided market stability.  </p>
<p>&quot;So we would obviously be pleased that they have made a decision on what to do with their shares because it has taken them a while to make a decision,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very hard to see how it is at all bad for Normandy shareholders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, de Crespigny it was too early to judge whether or not the move would lead to a lift in Normandy's share price.</p>
<p>&quot;If insecurity has been a reason the price is down, then this has to be good for it,&quot; he said, but added there were other issues involved, such as gold market sentiment.</p>
