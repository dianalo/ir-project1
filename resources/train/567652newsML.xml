<headline>P&amp;O, Stena ferry merger decision due in May.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>P&amp;O European Ferries said in a statement on Wednesday that a decision on its planned merger with Stena Line would be known before the end of May.</p>
<p>In a statement following a meeting with works councils of P&amp;O European Ferries Calais, Stena Line Calais and Stena Line Dieppe, the company said that the merged unit would have assets of 410 million pounds and a fleet of 14 vessels.</p>
<p>&quot;Awaiting the green light of the French, Belgian, British and European authorities, the decision on the merger of P&amp;O Stena Line should be known before the end of May,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Of the 14 vessels, three Stena vessels will be laid up.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the company said that the new British government's decision whether to allow the merger was crucial as &quot;Brussels has indicated it would align itself with the British decision.&quot;</p>
<p>The two operators have been talking about a merger ever since the opening of the Channel Tunnel operated by Eurotunnel SA/Plc, which has led to a fall in prices and caused overcapacity.</p>
<p>Britain's Department of Trade and Industry long forbade the two from linking up but the matter is now in hands of the Mergers and Monopolies Commission (MMC).</p>
<p>P&amp;O Stena Line would have a Calais/Dover service with departures every 45 minutes. It would use three freight ferries on Zeebrugge/Dover and the new rapid catamaran of Stena as well as a mixed ferry on Dieppe/Newhaven.</p>
