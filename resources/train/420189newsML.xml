<p>Republicans do not plan to craft their own budget but will request President Clinton to make changes in his plan to enable it to reach balance in the year 2002, Senate Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;More than once, through more than one official channel, they asked us if we would not produce a budget and use their budget for purposes of producing a budget for the United States,&quot; the New Mexico Republican said at a Budget Committee hearing.  </p>
<p>Domenici said the next step will be to see if the White House would make substantial changes in response to congressional analysis that showed the president's budget would leave a $69 billion deficit in 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't appreciate insinuations that I am not going to do my job. We were asked to work with the president off his budget and we are doing our best. But it is getting progressively difficult when we get reports like this,&quot; he said in reference to the Congressional Budget Office estimate of the Clinton budget. The CBO report was issued Monday.</p>
<p>Domenici's statement was in response to criticisms by Democrats on the panel that Republicans had not drafted an alternative budget proposal as they had in past years.</p>
<p>Sen. Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said Republicans should not criticize Clinton's plan without providing a substitute and he noted that Republicans have proposed nearly $200 billion in tax cuts over five years without suggestions of ways to pay for the revenue loss.</p>
