<p>Heavy mid-June rains in Ivory Coast raised wet season rainfall totals to at least average levels and boosted prospects for the 1997/98 (October-April) main cocoa crop, weather analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Soil moisture is now back to normal from the north to the south,&quot; said a national weather station spokesman. &quot;The weather has been good.&quot;</p>
<p>All areas had received average rain and some were in surplus.</p>
<p>Rains picked up in the first 20 days of June after a dry period in early May cast a brief shadow over main crop prospects, he added.</p>
<p>Official national weather data for the second 10 days of June showed rains averaged 147.4 mm at 10 monitored stations against 122.6 mm in the previous 10 days.</p>
<p>Rain also spread further inland recently from south coastal areas and reached other key producing areas in the centre and centre-west, crop analysts said.</p>
<p>Fears that dry weather in late 1997 associated with a forecast &quot;El Nino&quot; weather pattern could damage crop prospects, coupled with technical trading, drove London cocoa prices to a one year-high of 1,160 stg a tonne on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Upcountry buyers and exporters, optimistic about harvest prospects for the 1997/98 season, said rains had nevertheless slowed drying of this year's mid-crop beans and cut off access to some villages.</p>
<p>A buyer based around Daloa and Gagnoa said the crop could be even better than last year, pointing to abundant flowering for cocoa pods in his area.</p>
<p>Mid-crop arrivals in June were slow and some buyers planned to close buying stations in July, said another.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not much around now,&quot; he said by telephone from Gagnoa. &quot;Certainly a lot less than last year and some pistes (tracks) are unpassable.&quot;</p>
<p>Crop analysts said they expected port deliveries to pick up in July and August.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer and exporter, harvested a record 1.2 million tonnes in 1995/96. Port arrivals in 1996/97 totalled around 1.04 million by mid-June.</p>
<p>U.K-based trader ED and F Man in May pointed to poor flowering as indicating that next year's crop would be small. Traders have said U.S.-based analyst Hans Killian in June put the 1997/98 main crop at just 785,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>But French-Swiss chocolate giant Callebaut Barry has set a total 1997/98 crop of 1.1 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Crop analysts say early pod growth on trees by June only gives an indication of potential harvests up to the end of December.</p>
<p>June forecasts for 1997/98 and later months can only be based on statistical comparisons and extrapolation of data but would be fine-tuned in August, they say.</p>
<p>Low forecasts by analysts at the same time last year proved to be far below the mark.</p>
<p>The latest weather data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall (mm) for the second 10 days of June in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (previous 10 days bracketed):</p>
<p>Daloa* 84.1 (7.8)</p>
<p>Gagnoa* 156.4 (36.6)</p>
<p>San Pedro** 133.5 (101)</p>
<p>Tabou** 68.8 (68.8)</p>
<p>Man* 97.8 (11.8)</p>
<p>Dimbokro* 165.4 (54.2)</p>
<p>Yamoussoukro* 112.8 (26.4)</p>
<p>Abidjan** 271.8 (270.6)</p>
<p>Sassandra** 112.0 (133.8)</p>
<p>Adiake** 200.3 (459.2)</p>
<p>Korhogo 70.7 (56.2)</p>
<p>Stations with average wet season rainfall by the end of the second 10 days of June are marked with an asterisk (*). Areas with more than the seasonal average since May 21 are marked with two asterisks. Korhogo reached average levels in the first 10 days of June.</p>
