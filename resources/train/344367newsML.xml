<p>Greece will give thousands of illegal immigrants residence and work permits, the labour ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more than 400,000 illegal immigrants in Greece and if we don't take measures there will be around a million by the year 2000,&quot; Labour Minister Miltiadis Papaioannou told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said illegal migrants would have two months to submit applications to stay.</p>
<p>&quot;Registering these people will be a very difficult task but we have to do something about it. The new law is based on similar ones in Italy, France and Portugal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The immigrants would be given a maximum nine-month work and residence permit free of charge. They would then be able to receive social security benefits but must also file tax statements, Papaioannou said.</p>
<p>Ministry officials told Reuters that when the initial permits expire, the immigrants would be granted new ones valid for up to five years.</p>
<p>&quot;Only those immigrants who have the first permit will be eligible for the second. Those who don't apply will be considered illegal and will be immediately expelled,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Papaioannou said border patrols would be increased to stop aliens entering the country illegally.</p>
<p>Most illegal immigrants in Greece are from Albania and the Philippines. Many others come from Poland, Iraq, Bulgaria and the former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>Most of them clean houses or work on farms or in filling stations, restaurants and nightclubs to support families at home.</p>
