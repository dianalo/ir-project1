<p>Leading Russian shares closed slightly down on moderate volumes on Friday and dealers said investor cautiousness would keep the market quiet and relatively unchanged next week.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 23-share index closed down to 294.94 from Thursday's 298.24 on total trade volume of $29.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of uncertainty -- everyone is waiting until someone begins to do something,&quot; said one Western trader.</p>
<p>National power utility UES  EESR.RTS had edged up to $0.2095 after $0.2080 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Natural gas monopoly Gazprom  GAZP.RTS had slipped to $0.630 as the market prepared to close after finishing on Thursday at $0.647. But Gazprom was up from a low of $0.618 in early Friday afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Russia's largest oil producer LUKoil  LKOH.RTS also nudged down $13.400 at 6 p.m. (1400 GMT) from $13.570.</p>
<p>&quot;The volumes in individual securities don't look bad, but the number of clients trading is not very big,&quot; said UCB head trader Samit Yakovlev.</p>
<p>Dealers said that caution among Western investors wondering if the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again was pressuring the Russian market.</p>
<p>Data indicating a strong U.S. economy on Friday led some analysts to think that another interest rate hike was possible. The Fed last raised rates on March 25.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on the rise in interest rates in May, although I think that whatever happens, there will be a stabilisation in May because everybody will be ready for it by then,&quot; said Yakovlev.</p>
<p>Traders said they did not expect the market to fall sharply in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;It's more likely levels will continue as they are,&quot; Yakovlev said.</p>
