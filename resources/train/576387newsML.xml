<title>USA: NASA counts down for shuttle mission to Mir.</title>
<headline>NASA counts down for shuttle mission to Mir.</headline>
<dateline>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>The countdown was proceeding smoothly for Thursday's predawn blastoff of the space shuttle Atlantis on a mission to Russia's Mir space station, NASA officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>NASA test director Doug Lyons said launch controllers faced no technical problems during the early hours of the countdown. The shuttle's electricity-generating fuel cells had been doubled-checked, he said. The last shuttle mission was cut short by a fuel cell failure.</p>
<p>Blastoff on Thursday was scheduled for about 4:08 a.m. EDT (0808 GMT). Forecasters gave Atlantis an 80 percent chance of fair weather for launch.</p>
<p>Atlantis is to dock with the orbiting Russian outpost to pick up U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger and drop off his replacement, Michael Foale, for a four-month tour of duty.</p>
<p>The shuttle will also haul nearly 4,000 pounds (1,814 kg) of equipment and supplies to Mir, including a new oxygen generator. The station has suffered a series of breakdowns in its life support systems since a serious fire in February.</p>
<p>The countdown clocks began ticking at the Kennedy Space Centre late on Sunday night shortly after the arrival of the shuttle's seven-member international crew from their training base in Houston.</p>
<p>In addition to the British-born Foale, Atlantis' crew includes a Russian woman and a French astronaut from the European Space Agency.</p>
