<p>The Copper Journal said despite strong near-term fundamentals, the price of copper will average about 85 cents per pound this year.</p>
<p>John Gross of the Copper Journal said should the spot market get to 111.00 cents and fail to advance further, it will be viewed as a sign of weakness and represent a potential selling opportunity.</p>
<p>On Monday spot COMEX hit 110.80 cents, its highest since just before prices crashed mid-June 1996 after Sumitomo announced huge losses from copper deals.</p>
<p>Midday Tuesday, COMEX March copper was traded at 106.20 cents, with spot January at 108.50 cents.</p>
<p>Gross said 111.00 cents was the support line until the price plunged last June, and many traders believe old support becomes new resistance.</p>
<p>If copper breaks through 111.00 cents, the next line of resistance would be at 120 cents.</p>
<p>But the volatile nature of copper should keep traders on their guard as it probes near 111.00 cents, Gross said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because when the market is flashing the yellow caution signal, as it does at a support or resistance line, you want to slow down, observe how the market is responding to the signal, in order to determine if it is safe to proceed,&quot; Gross said.</p>
