<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-11</dateline>

<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities climbed higher across the board in an abbreviated Friday session, with yield spreads widening by a few ticks to Treasuries, particularly in premium coupons, traders said.</p>
<p>Underperforming premiums all week, discount coupons rebounded in today's light market rally, said a New York-based trader.</p>
<p>Although yield spreads are still moderately wider to comparable Treasuries, &quot;(discounts) are doing better today,&quot; the trader said. &quot;But they've performed a lot worse over the last couple of days.&quot;  </p>
<p>Late on Friday, pass-throughs were 11/32 higher in coupons of 7.0 percent and smaller, and were 1/32 to 9/32 in premium coupons. The 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 to yield 6.56 percent.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were up 10/32 at 99-13/32, yielding 109 basis points over 10-year Treasuries.</p>
<p>Comparable FNMAs were up 9/32 at 99-10/32, and FHLMCs were up 10/32 at 99-15/32.</p>
<p>The Public Securities Association has recommended an early close of 1400 EDT/1800 GMT for the market and a full close for Columbus Day Monday.</p>
