<title>RUSSIA: Russian government approves 1997 budget cuts.</title>

<p>The Russian government approved a plan to cut spending in its 1997 budget, which was necessitated by a significant shortfall of expected revenue, a government spokeswoman said Friday.</p>
<p>Details of the plan, which must still be approved by parliament, were not immediately released.</p>
<p>Last week First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said that revenues in the first quarter were only 57 percent of budgeted levels.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the government had agreed in principle to a Finance Ministry proposal to cut spending in line with lower-than-expected revenues.</p>
<p>Under the 1997 budget law, if revenues in any quarter are less than 90 percent of planned, the government must present a bill to the State Duma (lower house of parliament) on cutting spending.</p>
<p>The spending cuts have to win approval in parliament, which is dominated by communists and conservatives. Many deputies have already said they will not allow the government to reduce budget support and cut social payments.</p>
