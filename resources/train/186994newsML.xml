<p>Bands of dense snowstorms fed by the warm waters of the Great Lakes buried parts of five states under a pre-season taste of winter on Tuesday, knocking out power to thousands and closing schools.</p>
<p>Residents of this northern Wisconsin town dug out from nearly three feet (1 metre) of snow and more was on the way.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't have any snow on the ground before Friday, so it's actually a little late this year, but now it looks like it's been here for months,&quot; said Linda Ryskewecz, Hurley's deputy city clerk. Many residents had already equipped their trucks with plows and most roads were clear, she said.</p>
<p>But people were less prepared in Cleveland where fleets of plows were hastily assembled to tackle the nearly non-stop snowfall and hardware stores ran out of shovels and other winter gear.</p>
<p>Cleveland's Hopkins Airport was partially closed after two jets on successive nights slid off the snowy runways upon landing. No one was hurt in either incident.</p>
<p>The city's schools remained closed for a second day and 20,000 customers of the local utility were without power, down from 175,000 on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. had 350 crews out restoring power but their work was hampered by impassable roadways in areas east of the city, where as much as four feet (1.3 metres) of snow had fallen. Some rural residents lacked both heat and water because electric-powered furnaces and water-well pumps shut down.</p>
<p>The snow squalls were forecast to continue sporadically through Wednesday along the southeastern shores of the Great Lakes, followed by bone-chilling cold likely to freeze roadways and topple more trees weighed down by snow. Snow continued to fall in parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Lake effect&quot; snow is common in late autumn before the Great Lakes freeze over. Cold northerly winds pick up moisture from the relatively warm waters, forming clouds that can dump heavy, wet snow along the coastline. The fickle winds sometimes inundate one section of coastline while sparing another and leaving areas a short distance inland untouched.</p>
