<p>The United Nations human rights investigator for Zaire has accused Tutsi-led rebels in the east of continuing to massacre civilians and Rwandan Hutu refugees.</p>
<p>Roberto Garreton, the U.N. human rights investigator for Zaire since 1994, also told Reuters in a weekend interview that he was demanding a full U.N. investigation into the killings and mass graves with the help of forensic scientists and experts.</p>
<p>He said he had eyewitness accounts of many killings by the rebels long after their military victories late last year.</p>
<p>&quot;In parts of east Zaire, the war is finished. But massacres by the rebels are continuing,&quot; Garreton said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a list of massacres committed by the rebels. In March, there were still people disappearing, people being arrested and new massacres,&quot; he said following a brief visit to the rebel-controlled border town of Goma last week.</p>
<p>The rebels took up arms six months ago and have captured more than a quarter of Zaire with little opposition from demoralised Zairean government troops.</p>
<p>East Zaire's tinderbox of rival ethnic groups exploded after the 1994 influx arrival of Rwandan Hutu refugees and militiamen following the Hutu-led genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Advances by the rebels late last year forced 700,000 Rwandan Hutus to return home and shifted the balance of power in the region, sending more than 300,000 refugees and Hutu militiamen fleeing deeper into eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;This war is between Hutus and Tutsis. It is an ethnic war,&quot; Garreton said.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially there were three parties to this war -- the rebels, the Zairean army and the Hutu militiamen. They all killed and committed massacres. But Zairean army troops are less responsible now because they all fled,&quot; Garreton said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pessimistic about the future of this region.&quot;</p>
<p>It was impossible to verify independently the latest accusations of massacres by the rebels.</p>
<p>Garreton said he would give details of new abuses alleged to have been committed by the rebels in February and March in his report to the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva.</p>
<p>Most of the victims were Rwandan Hutus. The dead also included local Zaireans, he said.</p>
<p>Garreton said he had not himself seen any corpses during his Goma trip and demanded a detailed probe by independent experts to be appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>He said the number of people alleged to have been killed by the rebels since October ranged from hundreds to 50,000.</p>
<p>&quot;People showed me places -- 20 bodies buried here, 40 there. I couldn't open the graves. This job needs to be done with the help of experts, forensic scientists and policemen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted experts who could tell me how the people died, when they died. There are massacres still, now. That's why the problem is grave. I want a full investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>During his visit to Goma, Garreton said the rebels had failed to come up with satisfactory answers to allegations of killings, torture and disappearances.</p>
<p>He said he saw three mass graves near the empty refugee camps of Kibumba, Katale and Kilimanyako but that his attempts to visit several others had been thwarted by rebels on grounds of security risks or lack of official authorisation.</p>
<p>In Goma, Garreton met a senior aide to rebel leader Laurent Kabila, his chief of cabinet Moese Nyarugabo, who told him &quot;this is a war and in a war there are killings and disappearances&quot;.</p>
