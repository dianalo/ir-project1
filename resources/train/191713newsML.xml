<text>
<p>North Sea crudes were mostly steady at the lower levels in quiet trade on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said, the market had largely shrugged off news of higher December loading programmes with thinner supply of late November cargoes supporting the wet Brent market.</p>
<p>Wet Brent traded at 48 cents under December or the equivalent of 16 cents under January and at dated Brent +4 cents. Both levels were around unchanged from previous trade.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the remaining Nov Brent was held by Statoil who added a further two cargoes to their inventory today and are expected to take the barrels transatlantic.</p>
<p>Supplies of other North Sea grades were also limited with the remianing Statfjord cargoes sold at dated Brent +15 cents and +18 cents. The last remaining Oseberg having sold late on Thursday at a relatively healthy Dated Brent plus 23 cents and traders saw only Ekofisk cargoes left for sale in November.</p>
<p>A December 8-10 loading Forties cargo achieved a slightly firmer rate of Dated Brent +20 cents</p>
<p>Next week's CFDs steadied a little in late business to Jan Brent flat with a Nov 18-22/25-29 roll done at +3 cents.</p>
