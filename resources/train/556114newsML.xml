<title>USA: Illinois group seeks tighter control on hog farms.</title>
<headline>Illinois group seeks tighter control on hog farms.</headline>

<p>Members of an Illinois group opposed to the proliferation of large hog farms on Friday urged Governor Jim Edgar to tighten controls on the location and operation of large hog farms.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't ban these operations.... It's not going to happen. But these things (large hog farms) have to be put in the right place,&quot; said Chirag Mehta, agriculture project coordinator for the Illinois Stewardship Alliance.</p>
<p>Mehta said hog farms need to be situated where they will not threaten local water supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;We want some stronger regulations. The bottom line is these operations produce more waste than the land can handle,&quot; said Mehta.</p>
<p>Alliance members met in Springfield with Allen Grosboll, an adviser to the governor. Mehta said Grosboll agreed to set up a meeting with Edgar about the Livestock Management Facilities Act, which regulates livestock operations.</p>
<p>Grosboll could not be reached for comment.  </p>
<p>Hog farms have come under attack in Iowa and North Carolina, the two largest hog producing states, because of problems with waste management, water pollution and odor.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Representative Richard Morgan introduced a bill in the North Carolina state legislature that would impose a one-year moratorium on construction or expansion of any swime farm or waste lagoon in the state.</p>
<p>North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt earlier had called for a two-year moratorium on new and expanding hog farms.</p>
<p>The Illinois Pork Producers Association said its producers are complying with the Livestock Management Facilities Act, which has been in place for a year.</p>
