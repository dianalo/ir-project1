<p>The question of Burma's entry into ASEAN is expected to be centre-stage at this week's summit of the Southeast Asian grouping, ministers and diplomats said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ali Alatas, foreign minister of host Indonesia, told reporters that none of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' seven members opposed the entry of Burma, or Myanmar. He said discussion of the issue during the summit was possible.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle, the entry of Myanmar into ASEAN poses no problems to ASEAN. All ASEAN members are agreed that Myanmar needs to enter, needs to be accepted as a member.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats said what was at issue was when Burma, the focus of international concern over its human rights record, would be granted entry.</p>
<p>ASEAN -- which groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- is to hold its annual summit in Jakarta on Saturday. Also attending will be leaders from observer countries Laos, Cambodia and Burma.</p>
<p>The one-day, free-wheeling meeting has no papers and no fixed agenda, diplomats and officials said. But the recent airing of differences by ASEAN leaders on when to grant Burma full membership in the group is likely to occupy centre-stage.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot say what they will talk about,&quot; said a Jakarta-based diplomat from one of the ASEAN nations. &quot;But I would expect quite a lot of discussion on Myanmar.&quot;</p>
<p>The Burma issue has dominated ASEAN since the military government in Rangoon launched a fresh crackdown on the democracy movement of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in April.</p>
<p>Western nations and human rights activists have said that accepting Burma's application for full membership in ASEAN would be tantamount to approving Rangoon's policies.</p>
<p>ASEAN follows a strict policy of not interfering in the internal affairs of member nations and officially maintains that constructive engagement with Burma is the best way to achieve political reform in that country. Isolating Rangoon would be counter-productive, its leaders have argued.</p>
<p>But last month, Philippine President Fidel Ramos said ASEAN could review its constructive engagement policy with Burma. Then Amnuay Viravan, then Thailand's foreign minister, said Rangoon should introduce democracy before joining the group.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, whose country has made heavy investments in Burma, caused a stir when he said he did not think Rangoon was ready for full membership on economic grounds.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Malaysia and Indonesia were believed to be in favour of quickly admitting Burma into the fold, perhaps next year along with Cambodia and Laos, and that they expected the issue to be thrashed out at Saturday's summit.</p>
<p>Burmese leader General Than Shwe is to attend the meeting, building on contacts in the group following a visit to Malaysia earlier this year.</p>
<p>Diplomats played down suggestions of sharp differences within the usually united ASEAN group.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN is very cautious but never backtracks,&quot; said one. &quot;It does have to go through debate in reaching a consensus. It takes time, but it has its own merits.&quot;</p>
<p>The leaders at the summit, who represent some of the fastest growing nations in the world, were also likely to finalise a common stand to be taken at the inaugural meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore next month, diplomats said.</p>
<p>They said much of their position will flow from decisions taken at the APEC summit, which was attended by all ASEAN members except Vietnam.</p>
<p>But one major area of difference will be ASEAN's opposition to the linking of labour and human rights to trade and investment issues, the diplomats said.</p>
