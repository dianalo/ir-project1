<p>Australia, inspired by a superb 116 from Mark Waugh, pulled off a two-wicket win in the second test against South Africa after a tense climax on the fourth day on Monday.</p>
<p>The victory gave Australia a 2-0 winning lead in the three-test series and completed a remarkable transformation after South Africa had at one stage led by 188 overall with all their second innings wickets standing.</p>
<p>Needing 270 to win, Australia resumed on 145 for three and seemed to be coasting to success at 258 for five until three wickets suddenly tumbled in successive overs.</p>
<p>Occasional seamer Jacques Kallis bowled Waugh in the 91st over after he had batted for five and a half hours and 228 balls, hitting 17 fours and a six.</p>
<p>Hansie Cronje had Michael Bevan (24) caught at slip in the 92nd over and Kallis trapped Shane Warne (3) lbw in the 93rd.</p>
<p>Having needed just 12 more runs to win with five wickets in hand, Australia suddenly needed five runs with only two wickets left.</p>
<p>But they were not to be denied and the game ended in style as Ian Healy flicked the third delivery of the 94th over from Cronje for six over deep backward square leg, carrying Australia to 271 for eight.</p>
<p>Waugh, essentially a fluent strokemaker, showed in his 11th test century that his determination, patience and resolve can be as crushing as that of his older twin Steve.</p>
<p>Having reached 50 on Sunday from 87 deliveries with eight boundaries and a six, Waugh resumed on 54 and his path to three figures reflected the increasing tension of the match situation and vaguaries of bounce in the pitch.</p>
<p>His second 50 took 112 deliveries and contained  seven boundaries, his only escape coming on 105 when Daryll Cullinan dropped a slip catch off fast bowler Allan Donald.</p>
<p>Mark and Steve Waugh weathered a potentially lethal first spell from Donald in the mornig and took their fourth wicket stand to 54 without undue alarm.</p>
<p>But Steve Waugh (18) then drove a wide, swinging half volley from Kallis into the covers where skipper Cronje dived at full stretch to his left to take a fine catch.</p>
<p>Both Mark Waugh and Greg Blewett were beaten by numerous deliveries from left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams that turned and bounced but, in between survival, Waugh never failed to attack the loose ball.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes before lunch Adams finally claimed a deserved wicket when he yorked Blewett for seven to make the touring side 192 for five.</p>
<p>But Waugh continued with a perfect mixture of attack and defence to ensure Australia a series win over the only country they have not beaten in a rubber in the last five years.</p>
<p>Having been bowled out for 108 in their first innings to concede a deficit of 101, Australia not only made the highest total of the match in the fourth innings but comfortably the highest fourth innings total to win at St. George's Park.</p>
