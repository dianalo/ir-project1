<p>British writer Salman Rushdie marked the eighth anniversary of his life in hiding on Friday, accusing the European Union of making only token efforts to press Iran into withdrawing its death threat.</p>
<p>The Iranian government has pledged it would not send anyone to kill the author but Rushdie said he had been told by the British government that attempts had been made on his life.</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is there have been a number of occasions in these years when I have been told that there have been serious attempts -- they haven't fortunately got anywhere close to me,&quot; Rushdie told BBC television.</p>
<p>Just this week, an increased bounty of $2.5 million was offered for Rushdie's life, eight years after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini imposed the &quot;fatwa&quot;, or death edict, that destroyed Rushdie's life.</p>
<p>Rushdie labelled the bounty a &quot;barbarity&quot; and said &quot;the EU's response to such threats has been little more than tokenist. It has achieved, in one word, nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Iran is under very little -- I would even say, no -- pressure on this matter. But for eight years, some of us have been under a fair amount of stress,&quot; he wrote in the Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;The extreme passivity of the Foreign Office has permitted the rest of the EU (European Union) to go to sleep on this issue, and has given the Iranians the sign that there is really no need for them to do very much at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A few stiff words once a year are no substitute for policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Foreign Ofice responded by restating its concerns about Iran's support for &quot;terrorism&quot; and the threat against Rushdie.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman said British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind had expressed concern at &quot;Iranian misdeeds&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Its weapons of mass destruction programme, its opposition to the Middle East peace process, its support for terrorism, and the threat to Rushdie all mean a normal relationship remains impossible,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The death sentence was issued for Rushdie's alleged blasphemy against Islam in his book &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. Since then, Rushdie has lived under 24-hour police protection, although in the past year he has appeared more often in public.</p>
<p>Iranian officials say the edict is purely a religious matter that the government cannot withdraw.</p>
<p>The Indian-born author said he hoped to see more aggressive British action on his behalf in the months ahead.</p>
<p>But Rushdie, known as a leftwing socialite on London's literary scene, placed his main hopes on the likely election of Labour leader Tony Blair as Britain's next prime minister.</p>
<p>An election is due by May 22, with Labour riding some 20 points ahead of the ruling Conservatives in opinion polls.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, on this tawdry anniversary, I ask Mr Blair to come to the aid of this one particular artist. As he knows, and has been good enough to tell me, the principles involved go far beyond the survival of a single individual,&quot; Rushdie said.</p>
<p>Days after the Foreign Office condemned the increased bounty on Rushdie's head, the Times newspaper said Britain nevertheless planned to sponsor a stand at an energy fair in Tehran, encouraging firms to invest in Iran's oil and gas sector.</p>
