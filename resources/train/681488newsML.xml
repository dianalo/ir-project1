<title>UK: Western oil refiners see healthy margins trimmed.</title>
<headline>Western oil refiners see healthy margins trimmed.</headline>

<text>
<p>Western oil refiners had healthy profit margins trimmed last week but in Singapore margins recovered from recent lows, according to Reuters data using standard product yields.</p>
<p>In the West, faltering gasoline hit refinery margins hard but they were still holding well above the average level of the past six months.</p>
<p>In Rotterdam, complex refiners were making $2.21 a barrel refining Brent last Friday, below the $2.55 average of the past three weeks but above the $1.65 six month average.</p>
<p>Gasoline and gas oil both lost about 80 cents a barrel compared to Brent crude last week while heavy fuel fell a more modest 25 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>Dealers expect another soft week on gasoline in Europe which could add further downward pressure on margins.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, there were similar losses on oil products against Urals crude.</p>
<p>A complex refiner in Italy now makes $1.88 a barrel processing Urals crude compared to an average of $1.61 over the past six months. But three weeks ago margins hit a peak of over $3.50 a barrel.</p>
<p>On the US gulf coast, refiners processing Brent made about $1.30 a barrel last week, sharply down from levels seen at the start of June.</p>
<p>Margins have averaged $1.12 over the past six months, hitting a peak of $3.21 in early April.</p>
<p>Last week's drop in margins reflected a drop of more than $1 a barrel in the value of gasoline compared to Brent. Heating oil and residual fuel also fell against Brent but by lesser amounts.</p>
<p>In Singapore, refiners saw a modest bounce from recently weak profit margins.</p>
<p>Complex refiners made $2.92 a barrel running Dubai crude last Friday compared to levels around $2.65 over the past three weeks.</p>
<p>Despite the gain, margins remain sharply depressed compared to levels over the past six months which averaged $3.90 a barrel and peaked at well over $6 in April.</p>
