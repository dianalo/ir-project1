<p>French stocks closed higher on Friday on a sharper than expected fall in U.S. producer prices that eased concerns of an imminent rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 13.52 points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,645.62 after recovering from a low of 2,582.12.</p>
<p>The bourse rebounded from its early losses on news that the U.S. producer price index fell 0.4 percent in February, the biggest monthly drop in two and a half years. The markets had expected a 0.1 percent dip in the PPI.</p>
<p>The data sparked a recovery in the Dow, which had recovered a third of Thursday's 160-point drop when the bourse closed.</p>
<p>&quot;People felt reassured by the U.S. figures,&quot; one trader said. The wholesale inflation data, coupled with a 0.5 percent rise in U.S. industrial production in February, suggested the U.S. economy continues to show steady, non-inflationary growth.</p>
<p>The trader said the bourse's rebound was partly technical, after its recent falls. Brokers said support levels around 2,600 points had held well under the selling pressure earlier.</p>
<p>Volume was 9.48 billion francs, with 7.4 billion on the CAC.</p>
<p>Renault shares resumed their advance, rising 5.4 percent to 139.40 francs. &quot;Investors are feeling more confident that they'll push through their restructuring plans,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Political pressure on chairman Louis Schweitzer to retract the plan appeared to be easing after President Jacques Chirac said he disapproved of the way the closure was handled but added that plant closures &quot;are, alas, part of life&quot;.</p>
<p>Shares in PSA Peugeot Citroen rose 2.65 percent to 659 francs, on top of a big rise on Thursday, on expectations that it will also announcing cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>Shares in Assurances Generales de France (AGF) fell 3.03 percent to 208 francs after its chairman hinted the group may bid for state insurer GAN. The quality of its earnings reported on Thursday also disappointed some analysts. Broker Dupont Denant lowered its recommendation on AGF's stock to hold.</p>
