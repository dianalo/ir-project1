<p>The U.S. government should stop supporting American oil companies with more than $55 billion a year in tax breaks, risk insurance, loan guarantees, and military protection for investments overseas, a consumer group said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Oil and gas companies enjoy U.S. tax credits worth several billion dollars a year based on their foreign tax payments and tax deferrals, according to a report by Citizen Action citing government and corporate figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has come to take Big Oil off welfare,&quot; said Citizen Action's energy policy director, Edwin Rothschild.  </p>
<p>The companies benefit from political risk insurance and loan guarantees provided by the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp, which currently has $1 billion in risk insurance exposure to 23 oil and gas projects, and $250 million in loan guarantees to 12 projects.</p>
<p>However, OPIC officials said the loans and insurance are provided at no cost to taxpayers because the agency has accumulated reserves of $2.6 billion from payments by companies to cover insurance losses.</p>
<p>By far the largest &quot;subsidy&quot; is the estimated $50 billion a year spent to protect the free flow of Middle Eastern oil.  </p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, the United States' dependence on oil is a primary factor,&quot; Rothschild said at a news conference. &quot;We stumble forward without any real policy commitment to alternative fuels.&quot;</p>
<p>Citing the latest Internal Revenue Service data available, in 1992, oil companies with 5.6 percent of all corporate assets claimed $5.3 billion or 22.4 percent of all corporate foreign tax credits.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute defended the tax breaks, saying they &quot;apply to all Americans and do not differentially benefit oil companies.&quot;  </p>
<p>An API spokesman added that the oil industry annually puts $25 billion worth of motor fuel taxes into the Treasury.</p>
<p>&quot;American companies have invested more money overseas in recent years because the federal government denies them access to develop our nation's vast oil and natural gas resources, especially those located offshore and in Alaska,&quot; API said.</p>
<p>&quot;(These restrictions) continue to harm our country economically and contribute to the rise of oil imports,&quot; it said.</p>
