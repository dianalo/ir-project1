<p>A flotilla of Chinese nationalists determined to challenge Tokyo's claim to a disputed East China Sea archipelago faced off on Monday with Japanese patrol boats in waters around the islands, Taiwan state radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 30 to 40 of the protesters' fishing boats have neared to within 12 nautical miles of the islands,&quot; the radio said, citing radio reports from the protest flotilla. &quot;They are being surrounded by Japanese coastal patrol vessels.&quot;  </p>
<p>There were no angry incidents reported and the activists pledged to carry out what they dubbed the &quot;Diaoyu Island World Cup Fishing Contest&quot;, a protest designed to challenge Japan's sovereignty by violating its waters.</p>
<p>It was not known if the protesters would attempt to pierce the Japanese coast guard cordon and reach the uninhabited islets 200 km (120 Miles) northeast of Taiwan. The islands are claimed by Tokyo as the Senkakus and by Taiwan and China as the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>Flying flags of the United States and Taiwan's exiled Republic of China, the protesters set sail late on Sunday despite Tokyo's pledge to thwart any landings and Taipei's warning that activities other than commercial fishing were not allowed outside of Taiwan's coastal waters.</p>
<p>The island chain has ignited fiery nationalist passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan since a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse there in July 1996, a move they said bolstered Japan's sovereignty.</p>
