<p>Tokyo stocks are likely to drift in the Tuesday trading session as investors retreat to the sidelines to watch currencies and wait for April current account data to be released on Wednesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Nikkei 225 ended 261.93 points or 1.28 percent lower at 20,223.82. Its June futures fell 230 to finish at 20,270.</p>
<p>&quot;Exporters will probably be weighted down by profit-taking once again,&quot; Kunihiro Hatae, Tokyo Securities general manager, said. &quot;Investors will have no choice but to play it safe and go for defensive stocks and domestic-demand reliant issues.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mounting worries that Japan's current account surplus data for April will show a substantial rise lifted the yen to 111.80 against the dollar on Monday, the highest since November 25, 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise of the yen was surprising but the selling was not not very fierce on Monday,&quot; a general manager at a medium-sized brokerage said. &quot;As long as the yen stays above 111 yen to the dollar, a sell-off should not emerge.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said that Wall Street's second straight record finish overnight was likely to provide psychological support, but was not likely to have the power to lift the indices.</p>
