<headline>London coffee futures tumble on fund sell-off.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-15</dateline>

<p>London's futures for robusta coffee took a tumble on Tuesday on a big fund sell-off, taking the benchmark September contract down by a hefty $100 or 5.8 percent to $1,635 a tonne by mid-morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all fund selling and there's no buying around,&quot; said one floor trader. The contract slipped through the previous key support at $1,695 and this triggered sell-stops and long liquidation by funds and specs.  </p>
<p>Traders said the slide was also exacerbated by origin selling especially from the Far East.</p>
<p>But they were unable to immediately pinpoint specific fundamental reasons behind the sharp falls, which have taken the market to the lowest level since late April.</p>
<p>The winter weather in Brazil's coffee areas remained mild while inventories in the United States were building up again.</p>
<p>Chartwise, traders put the immediate support at the triple bottom of around $1,610, the lows seen on late April.</p>
<p>After a dazzling price rally since early January on nearby supply tightness, the market peaked in late May at around $2,700 level before easing off again. --Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
