<p>Yugoslavia's ailing economy needs reforms and foreign money to survive, but neither seems likely before a deep political change takes place in the two-nation federation.</p>
<p>Local and foreign economists say that although official statistics paint a not-so-gloomy picture of the economy, its real condition is critical. They predict a plunge into recession unless it is re-capitalised through foreign investment and access to international financial markets.</p>
<p>Local economists say as little as between $200 million to $300 million would give breathing space to the economy, starved of cash, entangled by inter-company debt and becoming increasingly based on barter deals.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not received my salary for two years and suddenly they decide to pay me off with 350 kilos of pretzels but I would prefer the cash equivalent,&quot; said a 54-year-old worker at a components factory.</p>
<p>The worker, who has relied on selling various goods on a flea market to survive, will now try to peddle almost 7,000 dinars ($1,240) worth of pretzels there.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing will happen without radical reforms and until the state meets all conditions needed to attract foreign capital. Meanwhile, economic policy-makers can only choose between recession and hyperinflation,&quot; Stojan Stamenkovic of the Institute of Economic Sciences told Reuters.</p>
<p>SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT FAILS TO REJOIN IMF</p>
<p>The Socialist government has said it meets all conditions set for its return to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which would be the first step towards getting fresh funding and regulating its relations with other lenders.</p>
<p>But the Fund has decided to postpone a decision on relations with Yugoslavia until June.</p>
<p>Economists believe the West will not allow any deal between Serbia and the IMF until Belgrade is willing to cooperate on a number of issues relating to the wars that tore former Yugoslavia apart.</p>
<p>These include helping the international tribunal investigating war crimes.</p>
<p>Chances of reaching a deal with the West were hurt when the ruling Socialists tried to cancel opposition victories in municipal elections in November. The move triggered off weeks of mass protest and confirmed Western suspicions that democracy is still far off.</p>
<p>No deal with the IMF means that negotiations with creditors on rescheduling about $9 billion of Yugoslav debt -- owed to governments and private lenders -- are stuck.</p>
<p>DEBT, INERTIA CRIPPLE THE ECONOMY</p>
<p>The Yugoslav authorities are reluctant to start radical reforms likely to initially cause more hardship in an already disillusioned society, with federal elections due later this year.</p>
<p>Reforms needed include changing labour laws to create a flexible job market, privatisation, the overhaul of the banking sector and solving the problem of inter-company debt.</p>
<p>Last year the economy grew 5.8 percent but unemployment reached 25 percent of the workforce. Even optimistic forecasts see gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowing to about two percent while the unemployment rate rises to 30 percent this year.</p>
<p>In just one year since United Nations sanctions were lifted in November 1995, Yugoslavia ran a trade gap of $2.26 billion, while the current account deficit stood at around $1.5 billion or a little below nine percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Internal debt arrears rose to 6.5 billion dinars ($1.1 billion) at the end of January, far exceeding M1 money supply of 5.5 billion dinars. Printing money without an increase in savings would be suicidal because inflation is already 60 percent.</p>
<p>To attract more savings to devastated companies and banks, the state would first need to address the issue of old hard currency savings.</p>
<p>Yugoslavs lost some $4 billion in their hard currency deposits when the state decided to freeze the funds in early 1990s.</p>
<p>The population's savings were further depleted when two powerful pyramid schemes collapsed in April 1993.</p>
<p>These bitter experiences led to a total loss of confidence in local banks, which had only 118.1 million dinars in fixed-term dinar deposits at the end of January 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This translates into 11.2 dinars savings per inhabitant or 0.15 percent of GDP,&quot; said economist Slobodan Milosavljevic from the Institute for Market Research (IZIT).</p>
<p>Deprived of individuals' savings as a source of capital, Yugoslav banks have faced deteriorating liquidity and performance during 1996.</p>
<p>The licences of 15 illiquid banks have been revoked, and the government is considering the consolidation of the remaining several dozen banks into bigger groups, sources said.</p>
<p>PRIVATISATION STARTS BUT LACKS TRANSPARENCY</p>
<p>With the federal law not obliging companies to privatise, Serbia has moved slowly to privatise its outdated, inefficient and loss-making industries.</p>
<p>A newly-appointed privatisation ministry in Serbia, Yugoslav federation's main republic, is expected to submit a new draft privatisation law to the parliament as early as April.</p>
<p>Government intentions are closely guarded, but, according to leaks, the plan shuns any form of mass privatisation and is silent on privatising the few remaining lucrative industries, such as telecommunications, power and the oil industry.</p>
<p>POLITICAL TURNAROUND COULD SAVE ECONOMY</p>
<p>&quot;Legally and politically, the situation remains unclear for foreign investment. But a sudden political turnabout could easily send this economy sky-rocketing,&quot; said Predrag Simic, director of the Institute of International Politics and Economics.</p>
<p>It is not clear if the democratic opposition would be able to challenge President Slobodan Milosevic successfully in the national elections and whether, if they came to power, they would be prepared to embark on an ambitious reform programme.</p>
<p>But analysts pin hopes on an opposition victory, believing the relatively modern economy could be put on the right path quite easily if the political obstacles are removed.</p>
<p>&quot;This country must have a way out. There is a basic infrastructure and qualified labour and all it needs is a few hundred million dollars in external financial support,&quot; one local analyst said.</p>
<p>MONTENEGRO IMPATIENT OVER PACE OF REFORM</p>
<p>Montenegro, the smaller of the two Yugoslav republics, is getting impatient with Belgrade over the slow pace of reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Montenegro is behaving just as Slovenia used to before seceding from Yugoslavia. But Serbia should be more responsive to any Montenegrin criticism to avoid serious consequences,&quot; said a political analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Montenegro is home to only 650,000 people and contributes only five percent of federal economy, but it has been pushing hard with reforms at the national level and seeking a way out of international isolation. It has put pressure on Belgrade to meet IMF demands.</p>
<p>The latest in a series of threats coming from Podgorica government included Montenegrin readiness to get access to the IMF and the World Bank independently of Belgrade.</p>
