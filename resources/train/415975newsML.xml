<p>Thousands of glum workers from Renault Belgium marched through Brussels on Monday to protest against plans by the Renault group to close their plant.</p>
<p>A crowd totalling 3,500 from Renault Belgium, reinforced by workers from other threatened factories, chanted &quot;Renault Stays Open&quot; and threw firecrackers as the demonstration passed riot police surrounding the main European Union institutions.</p>
<p>There were some scuffles and the windows of some nearby buildings were smashed. Belgian radio reported two cameramen had been set upon by the some of the crowd.</p>
<p>A delegation of workers later entered the offices of Belgium's national labour council for talks.</p>
<p>&quot;Juppe - we want our pay&quot;, shouted protestors, addressing French Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who workers hope has influence over the Paris-based Renault in which the French state has a 46 percent stake.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene was due to discuss the Renault closure with Juppe on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;C4. Merci Louis,&quot; read one placard, referring to the form Belgians must complete to claim unemployment benefit and to Renault boss Louis Schweitzer.</p>
<p>The march was swelled by workers from the Belgian unit of Caterpillar , undergoing a restructuring, militant unionists from carmaker Volkswagen , and some of the several hundred employees facing the dole at steelmaker Clabecq.</p>
<p>Renault said last Thursday it would close its assembly plant in Vilvoorde near Brussels with the loss of 3,100 jobs as part of a reorganisation of production designed to save it 825 million French francs ($140 million) a year.</p>
<p>Luk Siebens, a 30-year-old single parent who had worked at Renault for the last 15 year, said he was resigned to losing his job. &quot;I'm a realist, I think there's a five percent chance (of keeping it)&quot;, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Production worker Bennie Van Noten, married with one child, said employees were clutching at straws, having occupied the plant, and organising more protests this week, which are to culminate in a national march for jobs next Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a 90 percent chance Renault will not go back on its decision,&quot; he told Reuters, &quot;the average age at Vilvoorde is 35, there is little chance we will find other jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>Workers said the main aim of the protests was to get the profitable, hi-tech plant reopened.</p>
<p>Union officials say they hold three trump cards in any negotiations with Renault chief executive officer Schweitzer.</p>
<p>They are holding 5,000 finished cars worth three billion Belgian francs hostage at the plant. The site also contains 10 billion francs of equipment and 2,000 semi-finished cars.</p>
<p>The occupied plant contains the moulds for the Megane Coupe D -- Vilvoorde is the only Renault site where the model is made.</p>
<p>Finally, the unions are waging a publicity war against Renault, hoping to dent its image as a socially-sensitive employer and thus affect car sales.</p>
<p>Unions are planning a day of protest action on Wednesday at Renault dealers around the country.</p>
<p>CEO Schweitzer is expected to come to Vilvoorde on Thursday to talk to Renault Belgium 's works council.</p>
<p>Belgian unions are counting on support from their Spanish and French colleagues, who they say have already agreed not to take on production quota moved abroad from Vilvoorde.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, French union fears of further job cuts in the Renault group were fired by a report in French newspaper Les Echos reported that Renault is expected to announce plans to cut about 3,000 jobs in France on top of the Belgian closure.</p>
<p>Renault had no comment on the report.</p>
<p>The Belgian government has condemned the decision as brutal and unacceptable but Renault's Schweitzer said on Saturday there is no chance the company will change its mind.</p>
