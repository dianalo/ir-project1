<p>Several thousand people took part in traditional Easter peace demonstrations across Germany over the holiday weekend to call for cuts in military spending, organisers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Easter peace marches were major events in West Germany during in the 1970s and 1980s as the Cold War raged, attracting up to 400,000 protesters. But the number of particpants has declined steadily since the collapse of communism.</p>
<p>In the southwestern town of Calw on Monday, police said around 3,000 demonstrators had gathered for a protest. They marched from a local army base into the town centre.</p>
<p>Around 600 protesters took part in a march from the Brandenburg gate in Berlin, police said.</p>
<p>Protests took place in around 50 locations including Frankfurt, Hamburg and Munich over the weekend.</p>
<p>A demonstration on Sunday against the planned expansion of an army training centre in the eastern town of Wittstock attratcted around 3,000 protesters.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the office in Frankfurt coordinating the marches declined to estimate of how many people had taken part in total.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to play the numbers game. What's more important than the number of people taking part is the issues they're campaigning for,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1980s, during the Cold War, everyone felt threatened. Today, the biggest threat is that the peace dividend isn't paid out,&quot; he added.</p>
