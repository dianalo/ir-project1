<p>A deadly riot that rocked China's mainly Moslem northwest last week has cracked Beijing's coveted image of ethnic harmony, but left the hard realities of its political control intact, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials in Yining town in northwestern Xinjiang say 10 people were killed and 144 wounded in rioting last Wednesday by members of the Uighur ethnic minority that accounts for most of the remote frontier's population.</p>
<p>While the riot was a clear symptom of the discontent behind the picture of Xinjiang harmony painted by Beijing propagandists, it was unlikely to do much damage to China's firm political grip on the region, said a Western diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not yet of a nature to be seriously alarming or seriously threatening to the Chinese authorities' control in Xinjiang,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>The swift response to the disturbances in Yining, a town in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture near the border with Kazakhstan, seemed to show China's ability to deal with unrest even far from the Han Chinese political heartland, analysts said.</p>
<p>Xinjiang, which for centuries lay on the very fringe of Chinese imperial rule, is considered vital for its strategic location in Central Asia and its rich and largely untapped natural resources.</p>
<p>The region is one of China's driest ethnic tinderboxes, where discontent and yearning for self-rule among the Moslem Uighurs and other native minorities have been exacerbated by waves of immigration by the Han Chinese and by the recent independence of neighbouring former-Soviet Asian states.</p>
<p>Chinese officials say relations between Xinjiang's ethnic groups are excellent and blame sporadic bombings and protests against Beijing's rule in the region on a handful of foreign-backed separatists.</p>
<p>In 1996, Xinjiang leaders joined those in the nearby and equally restive Himalayan region of Tibet in calling for a tougher crackdown on all dissent.</p>
<p>Beijing's highly vocal determination to suppress separatists and eradicate unregulated Islamic groups was a sign of the importance attached to retaining clear control in Xinjiang, diplomats said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a matter of national pride that China continues to hold on to that region and that there is no challenge whatsoever to their position there,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;They have reacted... firmly, promptly and swiftly to anything they see as threatening,&quot; he said. &quot;By and large... from their point of view, it has worked.</p>
<p>Officials say all 10 people killed in the Yining riot were Han Chinese, and residents say at least some were apparently targeted at random by angry Uighurs -- a worrying sign of the gulf between ethnic groups in the area, said Hong Kong-based analyst Barry Sautman.</p>
<p>Policies aimed at settling Han Chinese in Xinjiang in the 1950s and 1960s and their dominance in business and government had fueled resentment among the native Uighurs, said Sautman, a professor at Hong Kong's University of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Beijing had also failed to combat the contempt of many of the Han towards Xinjiang's indigenous people, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still the case that most Han people living in the minority region have a disparaging attitude towards the culture and customs of minority people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Beijing officials regularly accuse unspecified foreign countries of backing Xinjiang separatists, there was little evidence of such support from any of China's newly independent Islamic neighbours, said the Western diplomat.</p>
<p>China had made great diplomatic efforts to ensure Central Asian states -- home to most Chinese Uighur exiles -- were not tempted to tamper with Xinjiang politics, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There doesn't seem to me any evidence of a concerted effort... from outside China to stir up unrest,&quot; he said adding that internal pressures alone were enough to provoke more disturbances similar to the Yining riot.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation (in Xinjiang) remains tense and it is always possible for incidents of this nature to occur,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not the first, and probably not the last.&quot;</p>
