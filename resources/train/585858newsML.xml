<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin held out hope on Thursday that Germany would hand over a newly-discovered fragment of the Amber Chamber, a tsarist treasure seized by the Nazis during World War Two.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted a government spokesman as saying Chernomyrdin welcomed reports that Bonn might be ready to give back the fragment, whose discovery was announced by police in the German town of Potsdam.</p>
<p>Spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said such a gesture was made possible by talks in a German spa town last month at which Bonn and Moscow agreed to try to solve disputes over wartime art booty without harming relations.</p>
<p>&quot;This is yet another result of the recent understandings reached at the meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin had with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Baden-Baden,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Police in Potsdam said on Wednesday a small mosaic had been discovered and initial investigations confirmed it belonged to the Amber Chamber, an assembly of wall panels and furniture presented to the tsars by Prussia in 1712.</p>
<p>The chamber was dismantled and removed from an imperial palace near St Petersburg, then Leningrad, by German troops. It has not been seen since 1945 and is at the top of Russia's list of missing treasures looted by the Nazis.</p>
<p>But the German police said the small mosaic picture, depicting two couples relaxing in a garden landscape, had probably been separated from the rest of the chamber after the treasure was seized.</p>
<p>Moscow and Bonn are in dispute over a haul of art treasures, including a priceless Gutenberg bible and paintings by impressionists Claude Monet and Henri Matisse, seized by the Soviet Red Army from museums and private homes in Germany.</p>
<p>Germany wants the masterpieces back but many Russians say they should stay in Russia as compensation for Soviet sufferings during the war.</p>
<p>Russia's Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, overruled a presidential veto on Wednesday and passed a bill asserting Moscow's ownership of the art treasures.</p>
<p>Yeltsin must sign the bill into law in the six days or challenge it in the Constitutional Court.</p>
<p>A Kremlin adviser, Sergei Shakhrai, told Ekho Moskvy radio station that Yeltsin had issued &quot;instructions to look for procedural violations during the passage of the bill&quot;, indicating he was considering making an appeal.</p>
