<headline>ASIAN EXOTICS - Baht calms down after intervention.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Thai baht recovered from Friday morning lows by midday after the Bank of Thailand (BOT) denied market rumours of a band widening and intervened in spot and forward markets to stem the currency's decline.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rumours, that the BOT planned to widen the dollar/baht trading band, emerged in London markets overnight and prompted a sell-off in the baht.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted at 26.013/26.018 to the dollar at 0510 GMT after the BOT intervened in Singapore forex markets to sell the dollar at 26.025 baht, dealers said. The Thai unit fell to to a low of 26.090 in early trade.</p>
<p>Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, the central bank's division chief in charge of money and foreign exchange markets, told Reuters the Bank of Thailand had no plan to change the exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of U.S. investment houses were trying to attack the baht and buy dollars yesterday and it's been quite hectic today as well,&quot; said a U.S. bank dealer in Singapore.</p>
<p>Dealers said the dollar's sharp drop against the majors on Friday also helped the baht rebound, but it was still trading well above the central bank's mid-rate of 25.99.</p>
<p>&quot;People were reluctant to take many long dollar positions due to a weakening of the U.S. unit abroad and the central bank's intervention in the Singapore market,&quot; a dealer in Bangkok said.</p>
<p>But sentiment remained bearish and dealers said the baht could be vulnerable to further declines against the backdrop of continued weakness on the stock market and worries about the stability of the finance sector.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, regional currencies benefitted from the dollar's sharp fall against the yen as fears of a rate hike in Japan gained ground while the likelihood of a further U.S. tightening appeared to recede.</p>
<p>A speech by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan late on Thursday was viewed as signalling that the U.S. central bank might hold back from further rate hikes for the time being.</p>
<p>Greenspan said he expected economic growth to slow later this year and next, but that the central bank would need to act if that did not prove to be the case.</p>
<p>&quot;People took it as a sign that there won't be any immediate rate hike. That's why the market sold dollars and it has also turned quite bearish recently,&quot; a U.S. bank dealer in Singapore said.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 122.75/85 yen at 0510 GMT in Tokyo against its opening 123.15/18.</p>
<p>The rupiah rose amid steady money market liquidity though overall activity remained slow.</p>
<p>A U.S. bank dealer in Jakarta said the rupiah maintained a bid tone after strengthening to a high of 2,427.0 on Thursday in Singapore and New York while Jakarta was closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was traded at 2,428.50/29.50 at 0510 GMT against an opening of 2,429.0/30.0.</p>
<p>A local bank dealer said the dollar briefly touched an early high of 2,430.0 before it was sold down on weakness in major offshore markets, where players brushed aside the heated campaign for Indonesia's general elections on May 29.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, the ringgit rebounded on the dollar's fall but a lack of participation kept it confined to a tight range.</p>
<p>&quot;Ringgit sentiment for the short-term has changed due to weak dollar/majors,&quot; a dealer with a Malaysian bank said. &quot;A lot of dollar selling is expected at above 2.5100.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the ringgit's upside could, however, be limited due to political concerns after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he would grant full powers to his deputy Anwar Ibrahim and go overseas for two months later in May.</p>
<p>The Singapore dollar showed signs of strengthening beyond the 1.4400 level against the U.S. dollar for the first time in more than three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/Sing could come off to 1.4380 depending on how far dollar/yen comes off. The market is still long dollar/Sing and ringgit/Sing,&quot; the U.S. bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said several stop-loss sell orders for the U.S. dollar appeared to be building below the 1.4410 level. The Singapore dollar was quoted at 1.4412/22 at 0510 GMT.</p>
