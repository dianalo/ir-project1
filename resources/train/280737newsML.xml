<headline>Trial of Graf's father set to end next month.</headline>

<text>
<p>A judge trying the father of German tennis star Steffi Graf for tax evasion said on Monday he expected to give his verdict next month.</p>
<p>Peter Graf, 58, is accused along with family tax adviser Joachim Eckardt of evading 19 million marks ($12.2 million) of tax on the world tennis number one's earnings between 1989 and 1993. He was arrested in August 1995 and went on trial last September.</p>
<p>Judge Joachim Plass said that he expected to conclude the hearing of evidence on January 7, and that the following sessions would be given over to the final prosecution and defence statements.</p>
<p>Graf herself remains under investigation in the affair but investigators have said suspicions against her are not as serious as those against her father. She says she entrusted her financial affairs to him from an early age.</p>
