<p>The romantic epic &quot;The English Patient&quot; dominated the Academy Award nominations on Tuesday, while the musical &quot;Evita&quot;, starring pop icon Madonna, was virtually frozen out of competition.</p>
<p>Never one to endear herself to the Hollywood establishment, Madonna had brashly predicted she would win her first-ever best actress nomination. But the Oscar voters snubbed her.</p>
<p>In a glittering pre-dawn ceremony, &quot;The English Patient&quot; captured 12 nominations, including best picture, best actor for Ralph Fiennes, best actress for Kristin Scott Thomas and best director for Anthony Minghella.</p>
<p>The other contenders for best film also fared well with other nominations. &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Fargo&quot; each claimed seven while &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; earned five apiece.</p>
<p>Nominated along with Fiennes for best actor honours were Tom Cruise for &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, Woody Harrelson for &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, Geoffrey Rush for &quot;Shine&quot; and Billy Bob Thornton for &quot;Sling Blade&quot;.</p>
<p>Together with Scott Thomas, the nominees for best actress were Brenda Blethyn for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;, Diane Keaton for &quot;Marvin's Room&quot;, Frances McDormand for &quot;Fargo&quot; and Emily Watson for &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;.</p>
<p>Fiennes, in London starring in a stage play, said he was &quot;particularly delighted&quot; with the nominations piled up by &quot;The English Patient&quot;, a story of romantic intrigue set in Nazi-era North Africa and Italy.</p>
<p>Blethyn, little known outside her native Britain, spoke candidly on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show, saying: &quot;There's no way I'm going to win it.&quot;</p>
<p>Kenneth Branagh, who was nominated for best screenplay adaptation for his four-hour epic &quot;Hamlet&quot;, said: &quot;It is a tribute to everyone who worked on the film, especially William Shakespeare.&quot;</p>
<p>But Madonna, one of the world's biggest pop stars, was conspicuously absent from the list. &quot;Evita&quot;, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about the life of Argentina's Eva Peron, picked up five nominations but mostly in minor categories.</p>
<p>Musicals tend to fare badly among Oscar voters, but Madonna may also have hurt her own cause with her unrepentant bad-girl image.</p>
<p>Also missing were Debbie Reynolds for her comeback role in &quot;Mother&quot; and singer Courtney Love for &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot; -- both of whom were widely expected to be nominated.</p>
<p>The big surprise was double-nominee Billy Bob Thornton, a relatively obscure actor and screenwriter who has finally made his mark with &quot;Sling Blade&quot;, about a retarded man released from a mental institution 25 years after killing his mother and her lover.</p>
<p>Thornton, a former country singer who moved to Hollywood from Arkansas in 1983 and struggled for years to make a living at acting, admitted feeling strangely out of place on the list of nominees. &quot;I look at it and I say good grief,&quot; he said. He boasts a cult following for one of his more offbeat projects, &quot;Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town&quot;, a spoof on horror films.</p>
<p>The contenders for best supporting actor are Cuba Gooding Jr. for &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, William H. Macy for &quot;Fargo&quot;, Armin Mueller-Stahl for &quot;Shine&quot;, Edward Norton for &quot;Primal Fear&quot; and James Woods for &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot;.</p>
<p>Film legend Lauren Bacall, a first-time Oscar nominee, was considered the sentimental choice for best supporting actress for the &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot;. She is up against Juliette Binoche for &quot;The English Patient&quot;, Joan Allen for &quot;The Crucible&quot;, Barbara Hershey for &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; and Marianne Jean-Baptiste for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot;.</p>
<p>Along with Minghella, the nominees for best director were Milos Forman for &quot;The People vs. Larry Flynt&quot;, Joel Coen for &quot;Fargo&quot;, Mike Leigh for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; and Scott Hicks for &quot;Shine&quot;.</p>
<p>Legendary playwright Arthur Miller topped the list of nominees for best adapted screenplay for his film version of &quot;The Crucible&quot;. He is competing against Minghella for &quot;The English Patient&quot;, Kenneth Branagh for &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Thornton for &quot;Sling Blade&quot; and John Hodge for &quot;Trainspotting&quot;.</p>
<p>The nominees for best original screenplay were Ethan and Joel Coen for &quot;Fargo&quot;, Cameron Crowe for &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, John Sayles for &quot;Lone Star&quot;, Mike Leigh for &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; and Jan Sardi for &quot;Shine&quot;.</p>
<p>In the best foreign-language film category, Oscar voters picked &quot;Kolya&quot; from the Czech Republic, &quot;Prisoner of the Mountains&quot; from Russia, &quot;Ridicule&quot; from France, &quot;The Other Side of Sunday&quot; from Norway and &quot;A Chef in Love&quot; from Georgia.</p>
<p>The Oscars will be handed out on March 24 at the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium.</p>
