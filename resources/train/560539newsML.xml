<title>USA: Colombia's Ecopetrol awards two Cusiana cargoes.</title>
<headline>Colombia's Ecopetrol awards two Cusiana cargoes.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol awarded two early June cargoes of sweet Cusiana crude oil to two separate U.S. refiners late on Friday, trade sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders were closely watching this tender to set the tone for six other Cusiana cargoes loading in June, which themselves are expected to influence prices for light crudes in the U.S. Gulf market.  </p>
<p>The refiners paid a discount of between $1.20 and $1.40 a barrel to benchmark West Texas Intermediate/Cushing on an fob basis, a price that was higher than market expectations partly as a result of lower Caribbean freight rates, trade sources said.</p>
<p>The cargoes of 550,000 barrels each load on June 3-7 and June 5-9.</p>
<p>Ecopetrol awarded the cargoes just hours after bids were due. In many past tenders, the lag between the bid deadline and the award was much longer, traders said.  </p>
<p>In this tender, potential buyers also had the opportunity to buy both cargoes and load them on the same ship, traders said.</p>
<p>Cusiana crude, a gasoline-rich grade, is expected to gain more market attention next month, when it becomes deliverable against the July light sweet crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).</p>
<p>If Cusiana is delivered to a buyer instead of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate on the NYMEX, the seller would receive a premium of 15 cents a barrel to account for differences in crude quality.</p>
<p>The July contract expires on June 20.</p>
<p>Other foreign crudes that are deliverable against the futures contract are UK Brent and Oseberg, Norwegian Forties and Nigerian Bonny Light. The May contract saw the largest physical delivery in the contract's history, more than a third of which was foreign crude.</p>
