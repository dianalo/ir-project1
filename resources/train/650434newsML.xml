<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Tuesday French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin had expressed a clear will to go ahead with European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters before going into a meeting with EU Commission President Jacques Santer, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other major European leaders, Prodi also said that the French position on a stability pact was understandable for a government which had only just taken office.</p>
<p>&quot;The will to go ahead on Europe has been expressed in an absolutely clear way by Jospin with whom I had a long talk yesterday,&quot; Prodi said.  </p>
<p>Referring to France's request for more time to consider a stability pact requiring EMU members to keep budget deficit levels under tight rein, Prodi said: &quot;The French position is justifiable...for a government which has been in office for only a few hours. The Paris position is understandable, absolutely understandable.&quot;</p>
<p>Prodi also said he believed that the move towards EMU was not in any danger.</p>
<p>&quot;The single currency does not run any risk. It is an objective which has been taken on board by all the countries which took part in the launch of the project,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Asked if he favoured bringing forward to the autumn of 1997 the choice of countries which would take part in the first wave of EMU, Prodi said: &quot;Today we will open an across-the-board discussion on these subjects. The Italian position is well known.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;After this meeting we will be in a better position to define the timetable.&quot;</p>
<p>The selection process for countries joining the first EMU wave is due to take place in April and May 1998 and EMU itself is scheduled to start on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Financial markets have been nervous that the election of the French Socialists could throw into doubt the EMU timetable.</p>
<p>Prodi said financial markets &quot;are uneasy but there is no great turbulence.&quot;</p>
