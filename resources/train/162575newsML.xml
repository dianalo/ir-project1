<p>Kurds from Germany, France and the Netherlands joined others from Belgium in a march through Brussels on Sunday to protest at what they called Turkey's &quot;policy of destruction&quot; towards Kurds.</p>
<p>About 2,000 chanting demonstrators walked through the city centre, holding banners reading &quot;Against Fascists&quot;, &quot;Stop mass-murder in Kurdistan,&quot; and calling for a political solution to the Kurdish problem.</p>
<p>Over 20,000 people have been killed in a 12-year conflict in southeast Turkey where government forces are battling Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas fighting for autonomy or independence for the mainly Kurdish region.</p>
<p>One small group of marchers set fire to a Turkish flag, and police in riot gear were on hand. No major disturbances were reported.</p>
<p>&quot;We protest against the violation of human rights in Kurdistan which has reached a critical point,&quot; Kemal Kara, an organiser of the demonstration, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some PKK supporters were among the marchers.</p>
<p>Kara said the crowd was also showing support for the Kurdish-language satellite television station Med-TV, which Belgian authorities suspect of laundering money for the PKK. Med-TV, which has offices in Belgium, denies the allegations.</p>
<p>According to Amnesty International more than 1,000 civilians suspected of pro-PKK activities have been killed by security forces or death squads in the last five years.</p>
<p>Turkey faces 112 cases before the European human rights commission, including 61 applications from southeastern Turkey.</p>
<p>Last month the European Parliament voted to block $470 million in aid which had been earmarked to help Turkey set up a customs union with the EU, saying it was angered by Ankara's failure to keep promises to improve its rights performance.</p>
<p>But Amnesty International has also said the PKK killed at least 400 prisoners and civilians between 1993 and 1995. In recent weeks the separatists have launched a wave of suicide bomb attacks against police.</p>
