<p>COURT QUASHES TRADE UNION PLEA AGAINST ENRON</p>
<p>The Bombay High Court dismissed the petitions filed against the union and Maharashtra government agencies, Enron Power Development Corporation and its subsidiary Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The petition, filed by leftist trade union CITU and its associates, had challenged the validity of the renegotiated 2,450 megawatt power project to be set up by DPC at Dabhol in Maharashtra. Dismissing the petitions both on the grounds of merit and views of former adjudications, the court passed strictures against the state government over its conduct in first scrapping and then renegotiating the project.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT MAY SETTLE FOR 6.2 PCT GROWTH IN NINTH PLAN</p>
<p>The government is likely to accept a lower rate of growth of 6.2 percent for the Ninth Plan in view of the resource crunch. For 6.2 percent growth, the budgetary support has been estimated at 2,900 billion rupees, well within the budget of the Finance Ministry. Earlier, the Planning Commission had proposed a gross domestic product growth rate of seven percent for the Ninth Plan. Sources said the two scenarios of 6.2 percent and seven percent rate of growth would be placed before the cabinet for a final decision.</p>

<p>PARITY SOUGHT BETWEEN NON-RESIDENT INDIAN, DOMESTIC EQUTIES</p>
<p>The Industry Ministry proposed treating non-repatriable Non-Resident Indian (NRI) equity in telecommunication projects at par with domestic equity. The proposal envisaged that NRI equity be treated as domestic equity, provided the NRI equity remained non-repatriable for a period of five years. Sources said the NRI equity would be further subject to the condition that after the expiry of the five-year period, the investor would have the option to transfer the share only to an Indian or an NRI.</p>

<p>SANDOZ SHAREHOLDERS OPPOSE MERGER WITH HIND CIBA-GEIGY</p>
<p>A group of minority Indian shareholders of Sandoz (India) Ltd has launched a proxy war to oppose the terms of the merger of the company with Hindustan Ciba-Geigy Ltd. This is first time an Indian affiliate of a multinational is facing a proxy war from minority domestic shareholders. The German parent holds 51 percent stake in Sandoz (India) Ltd. Sandoz shareholders are opposed to the proposed 10:17 swap ratio between Sandoz and Hind-Ciba shares fixed as part of merger terms. Sandoz shareholders are also agitated over the fact that the Sandoz business is valued at one billion rupees even though the company is earning pre-tax profit of 350 million rupees.</p>

<p>POWERGEN SEVERES TIES WITH RPG POWER</p>
<p>British power company PowerGen severed its ties with RPG Power in its joint venture to develop the 770 megawatt Dholpur power project in Rajasthan. Sources said PowerGen and the RP Goenka group fell apart on the issue of an equity stake in the project. While PowerGen wanted a larger stake in the project, RPG Power was only prepared to part with a minority stake in the project. Earlier, PowerGen was promised a 20 percent equity in the liquid fuel-fired project and was supposed to be the operation and maintenance contractor for the project. However, no shareholders' agreement was eventually signed due to the differences, sources said.</p>

<p>CENTRAL BANK GIVES CLEAN CHIT TO RELIANCE</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said none of the 27 Reliance investment companies raised bank funds against collateral of Reliance shares from the banking system. This was told by the central bank to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Following the Reliance share switching episode, SEBI had asked RBI to find out if banks had advanced funds against the security of Reliance shares to any of its investment companies. Banks were worried whether the shares lying as collateral might not be genuine and feared that the borrowers might place shares with banks, and then subsequently report loss of these shares to the company.</p>

<p>PANEL SOON TO HASTEN PRIVATE SECTOR POWER PROJECTS</p>
<p>The government plans to set up an empowered committee on the power sector to expedite speedy implementation of private power projects. The committee will be headed by the cabinet secretary and have the secretaries of the power, oil and natural gas, coal and surface transport and railways. The Planning Commission deputy chairman will also be part of the committee. The new committee's essential purpose is to provide speedy clearance to power projects. It will not be a policy-making body. The idea behind having a broadbased empowered committee is to sort out outstanding issues, especially in connection with fuel linkages.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT CONCEDES TO HUGHES ISPAT, TELELINKS</p>
<p>After protracted delays, the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) has decided to award the basic services telecom circles of Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to Hughes Ispat, Telelinks and Bharti Telecom, respectively. DoT is likely to make a formal announcement shortly. The bids for Rajasthan and Karnataka circles, both of which were included in the first round of bidding itself, had earlier been rejected by DoT on the grounds that they were too low.</p>

<p>IMPORT CURBS TO GO IN FIVE YEARS: COMMERCE SECRETARY</p>
<p>The government would waive quantitative restrictions imports, including those on consumer products, in a phased manner in the next five years. This was indicated by Commerce Secretary Tejendra Khanna. Khanna said restrictions on imports of non-sensitive products would be lifted in the first phase and the sensitive products at a later date. He said a high-level committee under his chairmanship had been formed to formulate the new export-import policy for the next five years (1997-2002). The new policy would aim to double the exports and achieve at least one percent of total global exports, he said.</p>

<p>INDUSTRY OUTPUT GROWTH DIPS TO 8.6 PCT</p>
<p>The cumulative growth in industrial production of 172 industries dropped to 8.6 percent during April-August from 8.9 percent during April-July this year. Industry Ministry sources said the deceleration in growth in the industries, which account for 88 percent of the industrial production index, was expected to pull down overall industrial production. Significantly, the capital goods industry sustained its higher growth rates during April-August this year with chemical and pharmaceutical machinery industry posting the highest growth rate of 31.3 percent.</p>

<p>MNCS OPPOSE FRESH RIDER ON CLEARED PROJECTS</p>
<p>The American Business Council (ABC) expressed concern over moves by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to impose new conditions on already cleared projects. ABC, the apex body for U.S. multinationals operating in India, held discussions with government representatives and protested against the imposition of fresh restrictive terms. Sources said the issues taken up by ABC members included FIPB asking companies which had received clearances for 100 percent subsidiaries to divest their stake at the time of seeking permission to make fresh investments.</p>

<p>BOARD RESOLUTIONS ON COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS SOUGHT</p>
<p>The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has said the corporates should adopt board resolutions confirming compliance by the managing director and top executives of the company with the laws and statutes of the land. The IDBI move has lent a new dimension to the issue of corporate governance. Other financial institutions (FIs) are understood to be seeking certificates, but not board resolutions. Sources said the IDBI move had creating confusion among FIs on monitoring corporates where they had exposure. The company had never been asked to pass such a board resolution earlier by the IDBI.</p>

<p>2.4 PCT CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT SUSTAINABLE: PLAN PANEL</p>
<p>The Planning Commission has gone beyond Reserve Bank of India's estimate that a two percent current account deficit is sustainable in the Ninth Plan period. It said a 2.4 percent deficit would be sustainable if exports grew at 14 percent. The plan panel said the government should take measures to direct foreign direct investment into the export sector to reduce the trade gap. Sources said the growth path charted by the commission depended heavily on inflows of foreign capital to the tune of $50 billion. The commission expected the inflow to grow at a slower pace in the first two years before picking up momentum and averaging at $10 billion a year by the end of the plan period, sources ad</p>
