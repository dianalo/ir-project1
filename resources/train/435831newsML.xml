<p>A former security policeman unburdened himself before South Africa's &quot;truth commission&quot; on Wednesday, saying cold-blooded killings in the apartheid years had nauseated him and made him cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I am no longer sure that what I did, thinking it was in the national interest, really was in the best interests of South Africa,&quot; Captain Wouter Mentz, 37, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
<p>Mentz, testifying in an application for amnesty for his actions during the apartheid years, said he had witnessed the killing in cold blood of a black guerrilla, had taken part in an attack in Botswana in which two children were killed, and had committed perjury to protect the apartheid government from embarrassment.</p>
<p>Describing the Botswana raid, ostensibly aimed at a guerrilla target, Mentz said: &quot;I can still not sleep over this and even cry about it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he had acted as a look-out for his fellow officers, who stormed the house and shot dead an Indian couple and their two children in their sleep.</p>
<p>Mentz said he had no idea children would be in the house. &quot;I would never have taken part in the killing of children,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On another occasion he accompanied a group of officers who took a captured black guerrilla to an abandoned mine where they tied the man to a pole while the officers held a drinking party.</p>
<p>They then walked the guerrilla to a chair under which explosives had been placed. They shot him dead then blew him up, Mentz said.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked away because I could not associate myself with what was happening,&quot; he said. &quot;When we walked back, I became nauseous.&quot;</p>
<p>Mentz said the killing should have been carried out differently.</p>
<p>&quot;He's walking in front of us, he sees the chair, he sees the explosives. He has to know he's going to be killed...They could have blindfolded him. It worried me that he was looking straight at them when they did it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mentz said that he was a relatively junior officer and if he had objected to what the unit was doing he could himself have become a target for &quot;elimination&quot;.</p>
<p>Describing an ambush in which four arms smugglers were killed by his unit, he said that after the killing he and his colleagues drank heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone said jokingly that one of the smugglers was still alive...I took out my pistol and shot one of the corpses...My action was a drunken, irrational deed,&quot; Mentz said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this unburdening of myself will lead to greater understanding and reconciliation in South Africa...I want to put the past behind me, and look to the future.&quot;</p>
