<p>Brazilian shares ended modestly higher Thursday after paring earlier gains in another session marked by lackluster activity, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index  .BVSP closed up 0.52 percent at 63,910 points. Volume was a moderate 306.4 million reais ($300.2 million).</p>
<p>The Senate approval of a bill exempting exports from a tax levied by state governments failed to push stocks -- even those of export companies -- much higher, traders said.  </p>
<p>Share prices had already reflected the positive effects of the elimination of the so-called ICMS tax on exports of primary and semi-manufactured goods, traders said.</p>
<p>Mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, and steel firm CSN posted small gains. Analysts said the two companies would benefit most from the measure.</p>
<p>Vale preferred rose 0.71 percent, closing at 21.20 reais, while CSN stock gained 0.44 percent to 22.85 reais.  </p>
<p>Food processor Ceval, also named by analysts as a company that would benefit from the tax exemption, which climbed 1.51 percent to 8.02 reais.</p>
<p>Some traders said concerns over the so-called CPMF cheque tax weighed on the market Thursday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies approved regulatory details of the CPMF tax, a 0.2 percent levy on all financial transactions. It is intended to fund health services.</p>
<p>The bill was sent to the Senate, which might vote on the matter later Thursday.  </p>
<p>Benchmark Telebras rose by a modest 0.51 percent, closing at 78.40 reais.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo bourse's power sector index (IEE), comprising the nine most liquid stocks of the sector, rose 0.39 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected Friday's session to be marked by reduced volume and some profit-taking.</p>
