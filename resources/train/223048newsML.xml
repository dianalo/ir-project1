<headline>Tamil rebel chief rejects talks with Sri Lanka.</headline>

<p>The chief of the Tamil Tiger rebels on Wednesday rejected recent Sri Lankan government calls for peace talks to end a 13-year-old war and vowed to fight for a separate state for minority Tamils.</p>
<p>&quot;It is doubtful whether the ... government will allow a peace process (acceptable to Tamils),&quot; Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), said in a broadcast on the group's clandestine radio station in northern Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore we will keep on fighting. We will pay our blood as the price and we'll fight until we achieve our liberation,&quot; he said in a speech carried on &quot;Voice of Tigers&quot; radio and monitored in northern Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Prabhakaran addressed the Tamil community to mark the LTTE's &quot;National Heroes Day&quot;, when the rebels honour those who died in the LTTE's fight to create Eelam, a separate Tamil state in the northern and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not against procedures to find a peace through negotiations, but what we want is a real peace,&quot; the rebel leader said. &quot;Our Tamils must be able to live freely and with dignity and must be able to decide their political rights.&quot;</p>
<p>Mostly Hindus, Tamils make up 17 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 17 million people and say they face education, employment and language discrimination from the Sinhalese Buddhist majority.</p>
<p>The government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga has combined military offensives against the LTTE with a peace plan which devolves wide-ranging powers to Tamils through a constitutional revision.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga has also suggested she would consider third-party mediation to end the conflict on condition the LTTE lay down arms before beginning negotiations.</p>
<p>Security forces in the capital Colombo and military outposts throughout the island were on full alert because the LTTE has traditionally marked heroes' week with attacks on military installations and remote border villages.</p>
<p>&quot;We have received all sorts of information that the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) will try to create trouble in Colombo,&quot; Colombo police chief D.M. Dissanayake said.</p>
<p>The army said it was providing maximum around-the-clock security to the capital for the second day after Tuesday, Prabhakaran's 42nd birthday, passed without incident.</p>
<p>Security checks caused delays to traffic in much of the capital as cars and passengers were searched.</p>
<p>The Tigers torpedoed the last round of talks by sinking two navy gunboats in the eastern port of Trincomalee in April 1995, inviting a government offensive which pushed the Tigers out of their northern redoubts in Jaffna and Kilinochchi.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the conflict.</p>
