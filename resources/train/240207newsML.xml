<p>Four African candidates were nominated on Friday for the post of U.N. Secretary-General after Boutros Boutros-Ghali temporarily put aside his bid for re-election.</p>
<p>African ambassadors said the nominees were:</p>
<p>-- Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping, who has held a variety of top-level U.N. posts.</p>
<p>-- Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special representative for Burundi who is co-chairman of the Global Coalition for Africa group in Washington.</p>
<p>-- Hamid Algabid of Niger, the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.</p>
<p>-- Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95, who recently brokered a peace agreement ending five years of civil war in Sierre Leone.</p>
<p>All four names were put in letters to Italian Ambassador Paolo Fulci, the current president of the Security Council.</p>
<p>Cameroon's ambassador to Washington, Jerome Mendougu, led the delegation and submitted the names of Algabid and Annan. Cameroon holds the presidency of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).</p>
<p>Separately, the ambassadors of the Ivory Coast and Mauritania submitted the names of their respective candidates. Envoys from Niger said these two nominations had not reached Cameroon on time to be submitted by Mendougu.</p>
<p>It was not known if other candidates would step forward later. Senegal's foreign minister Moustapha Niasse was said to be in New York for this purpose but Senegal did not put forward his name at this time.</p>
<p>The move by the African states means the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee. Boutros-Ghali's five-year term expires on Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race.</p>
<p>His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse.</p>
<p>The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him. U.S. officials maintain he has not reformed the organisation.</p>
<p>But most diplomats believe the Clinton administration was bowing to pressure from Republicans in Congress, many of whom are opposed to the United Nations in general.</p>
<p>In response to criticism against the U.S. action, the New York Times reported that the Clinton administration had offered Boutros-Ghali his own foundation to run and the new title of secretary-general emeritus if he would step down.</p>
<p>But he rejected the offer made during a private dinner with U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright on Nov. 19.</p>
