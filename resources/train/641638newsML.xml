<p>China on Thursday announced the appointment of seasoned diplomat Ma Yuzhen as its top civilian official in Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to Beijing rule at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Beijing had decided to appoint Ma as Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from July 1, ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Cui gave no further details of Ma's appointment.</p>
<p>Ma and garrison commander General Liu Zhenwu will be Beijing's most senior officials in Hong Kong after the handover.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's domestic affairs will be run by Hong Kong residents after the handover, but foreign affairs and defence will remain the central government's turf.</p>
<p>Ma, 62, has been vice-minister of the Information Office of the State Council, or cabinet, since 1995.</p>
<p>He served as Chinese ambassador to Britain in 1991-95, consul general in Los Angeles in 1988-91 and director of the Foreign Ministry's information department in 1984-88.</p>
<p>Ma was first secretary at the Chinese embassy in Ghana in 1980-84, deputy division chief of the Foreign Ministry's information department in 1969-80 and third secretary at the Chinese embassy in Burma in 1963-69. He joined the Foreign Ministry in 1954.</p>
<p>&quot;Ma Yuzhen belongs to the new generation of diplomats...He's open-minded,&quot; said a former diplomat who asked not to be identified. China's old generation of diplomats consisted mainly of generals and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>In 1995, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post described Ma, who speaks impeccable English, as &quot;the sort of Chinese diplomat Western capitals love to play host to, affable, charming and not averse to talking quietly off the record with politicians and businessmen&quot;.</p>
<p>Ma was a &quot;well-liked senior diplomat, a favourite of Lady (Margaret) Thatcher&quot;, the Post said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times said &quot;Ma's genial good humour has contributed to earning him wide respect in London, at a time when things have not been all that easy between the two countries&quot;.</p>
<p>China and Britain bickered bitterly in recent years over the future of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Hong Kong newspapers had speculated that the first head of the Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong would be the current Chinese ambassador to Britain, Jiang Enzhu.</p>
