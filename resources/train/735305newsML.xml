<p>A team of researchers said on Thursday it has developed a blood test capable of early detection of ovarian cancer, a leading cause of cancer deaths.</p>
<p>&quot;Diagnosis of ovarian cancer at an early, treatable stage could bring about higher survival rates,&quot; said Douglas Gaudette, senior research associate at the University of Guelph and a member of the team that developed the test.</p>
<p>Currently, 70 percent of ovarian cancers are not detected until the disease has reached an advanced stage.</p>
<p>Gaudette and his colleagues found that women with ovarian cancer have a significantly higher level of lysoPC, a normal component of human blood, than that found in healthy women.</p>
<p>The test developed by the team identifies elevated levels of lysoPC in blood tests.</p>
<p>&quot;This finding is a promising start,&quot; said Gaudette.</p>
<p>Development of diagnostic tests for ovarian cancer and other types of cancer &quot;could expedite the introduction of intervention strategies at an earlier stage, which may be helpful in preventing malignancy,&quot; said Guelph University researcher Bruce Holub, another member of the research team.</p>
<p>Their findings were recently published in the International Journal of Cancer.</p>
<p>Support for the research was provided by the National Cancer Institute of Canada, the Genesis Foundation and the Medical Research Council of Canada.</p>
