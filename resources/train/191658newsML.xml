<p>Quantech Ltd, which is developing a medical diagnostic system for hospital critical care units, said Thursday it continues to expect to begin selling the system in 1997.</p>
<p>The first test planned for commercial introduction is one designed to detect and quantify cardiac &quot;markers&quot; that aid physicians in assessing whether or not a patient has had a heart attack, Quantech said in its first quarter statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are working to complete development of our commercial prototype so that we can begin collection of data to support our ... application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,&quot; president and chief executive officer Joseph Shaw said in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to anticipate a market launch of the product in 1997 and are excited about the technology and the reception we have had from the marketplace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Quantech said its surface plasmon resonance technology is being designed to provide rapid, quantitative results using whole blood.</p>
<p>Plans call for development of additional tests using the system, Quantech said.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, Quantech reported a net loss of $706,797, equal to $0.02 a share, for the first quarter ended September 30, versus a $558,067 or $0.07 a share loss a year ago. The company now has a weighted average of 46.9 million shares outstanding versus 8.3 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The company said the increased loss was due to higher research and development and administrative expenses.</p>
