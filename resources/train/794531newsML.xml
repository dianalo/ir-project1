<p>Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in France in July to leave year-on-year inflation steady at 1.0 percent, according to provisional monthly figures released by the national statistics institute INSEE on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prices have risen 0.5 percent since the start of 1997, INSEE said in a statement, noting that discount sales at retailers had led to a fall in prices in July for shoes and clothing, and to a lesser extent for other manufactured goods.</p>
<p>It said food prices rose 0.3 percent in July as a fall of 0.1 percent in fresh produce prices was more than compensated by rises in meat and coffee prices.</p>
<p>Manufactured goods prices fell 1.0 percent in the main month for summer discount sales by retailers, with shoe and clothing prices down 4.0 percent.</p>
<p>Financial markets keep a passive watch on consumer prices as they remain well within the Bank of France's guideline of two percent, as it has been doing month after month for a considerable time now.</p>
