<p>The Czech government is not preparing a devaluation of the crown as part of its economic stimulus package due on Wednesday, the CTK news agency quoted Czech National Bank Governor Josef Tosovsky as saying.</p>
<p>It quoted him as saying in an interview during the EBRD annual conference in London: &quot;We are not preparing anything like (a crown devaluation). At present we are not considering any change of exchange rate policy.&quot;  </p>
<p>He added that the central bank was waiting to see what would be the &quot;measures toward the resolution of the deficit of the current account of the payment balance&quot;,</p>
<p>He said that after that, the central bank would &quot;reconsider the complete monetary situation and consider if it is needed to make some corrections in monetary policy or not.&quot;</p>
<p>CTK reported that Tosovksy did not &quot;exclude nor say&quot; there would be a reduction in interest rates.</p>
<p>He said the central bank would first see what the government does, and then see how markets react before it takes any potential action.</p>
<p>Tosovsky echoed a comment on Monday by his spokesman, saying the sharp fall of the crown on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the government measures was no reason for the central bank to intervene.</p>
<p>The government package, scheduled to be announced at around 1500 local time on Wednesday (1300 GMT) is expected to address the growing budget and trade deficits while attempting to accelerate economic growth and complete economic reforms.</p>
<p>The central bank and the government have repeatedly ruled out a devaluation of the crown to help exports.</p>
