<headline>HK's Tung defends plan to deport children.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>New Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa on Wednesday defended his plan to introduce a bill that would deport illegal child migrants back to China.</p>
<p>Tung, speaking to reporters during a tour of China's garrison in the special Chinese region, denied that his draft legislation clashed with the Basic Law, the ex-British colony's constitution.</p>
<p>&quot;Our decision is definitely not against the Basic Law,&quot; Tung said. The Basic Law took effect on July 1 after Britain handed the territory back to China, ending 156 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government unveiled the immigration bill on Tuesday and asked the Provisional Legislature to rush it through during Wednesday's session, its first full sitting since the handover.</p>
<p>The new bill would allow the government to send home hundreds of youngsters -- most of whom claim residency rights through parents in Hong Kong but were smuggled in illegally from mainland China without waiting for legal clearance.</p>
<p>Legal experts and social activists in Hong Kong have criticised Tung's move, saying it contravenes the Basic Law by encroaching on the children's right of abode.</p>
