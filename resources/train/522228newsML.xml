<p>There are 74 days to go before the British colony reverts to China. These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>The Beijing-backed WEN WEI PO said people from various sectors have expressed support for proposals regarding the Public Order and Societies ordinances. The Democratic Party was dancing to the British tune in attacking the proposals, while British attempts to interfere in the future administration's legislation were irresponsible and harmed prospects for a smooth handover, the paper said.</p>
<p>The HONG KONG ECONOMIC JOURNAL said it was disappointed by Governor Chris Patten's remarks regarding the right of abode issue. If he insisted on boycotting the provisional legislature at the expense of the interests of the Hong Kong people, he would leave a bit stain on Britian before its withdrawal from the territory, the paper said.</p>
<p>The English-language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said the Hong Kong government's offer of a White Bill on the right of abode issue which can be finalised and handled on July 1 was a generous compromise given its opposition to the provisional legislature. If the interests of Hong Kong people are the real issue, it is time to think again and for the compromise to be accepted in a flexible spirit, the paper said.</p>
