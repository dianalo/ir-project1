<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin has pneumonia but his temperature is normal, the Kremlin said after doctors examined him at Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said in a brief statement that the 65-year-old president, who was taken back to hospital on Wednesday just two months after heart surgery, was being treated with antibiotics but gave no give other details.</p>
<p>&quot;Treatment of the pneumonia is being carried out with modern antibiotics and with general therapy,&quot; the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>Doctors said on Wednesday they had detected the first symptoms of pneumonia.</p>
<p>The president had returned to work in the Kremlin on December 23 following the quintuple bypass operation on November 5.</p>
<p>Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who led the operation, said Yeltsin's new illness was not related to the bypass and that his overall health allowed him to perform his duties as president.</p>
<p>He told reporters he had not seen the president himself but had spoken to doctors treating him.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I know, Yeltsin's health is quite satisfactory, and he is receiving regular medication,&quot; said Akchurin. &quot;It's true that I haven't seen him, but I know this from his physicians.&quot;</p>
