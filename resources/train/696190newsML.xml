<p>The Japanese copper market is carefully watching any developments related to South Korea's LG Metals Corp as a key to price movements, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, South Korea's largest copper producer said it had sold about 10,000 tonnes of copper to Germany's Metallgesellschaft and the cargo would be shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>Some traders have said the shipment could be aimed at covering LG Metals' short copper positions on the LME.</p>
<p>Last week Seoul's Finance Ministry summoned several domestic brokers to investigate overseas futures trading by Korean companies following a sharp increase in South Korean metal derivatives transactions through the LME.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very nervous (about South Korea),&quot; said a trader at one of Japan's major trading houses. &quot;It might flare up into a big scandal, like Sumitomo, and lead to a price collapse.&quot;</p>
<p>Another copper trader in Tokyo said: &quot;Copper prices will remain volatile...though we hear South Korean short positions have been largely reduced.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this month LG Metals said there was no need to worry about its open LME metal options positions but declined to comment on rumours in the London market that it could be facing huge losses after a copper rally in early June.</p>
<p>Japanese premiums for copper were unchanged at $65-$70 per tonne over the LME price, while the metal's fall towards $2,350 last week, coupled with the dollar's retreat against the yen, prompted some buying, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many are waiting (to buy) in hopes the prices will go down further, though some regard $2,350 as a floor in the near term,&quot; the first copper trader said.</p>
<p>The physical aluminium market remained tight in the absence of evidence of a decline in Japan's domestic demand following a surge ahead of a sales tax increase that took effect in April.</p>
<p>Traders said the metal's premiums were clinging to highs of $95-100 per tonne, with some deals seen as high as $110 per tonne. This was well above premiums of $86-$90 in term contracts for deliveries in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;The physical market is tight. There's not enough metal around,&quot; said one trader, adding that Yokohama warehouse stocks had fallen further to around 145,000 tonnes at the end of May.</p>
<p>Amid uncertainties over Japanese demand later this year some might have acquired less aluminium through term contracts for the third quarter as suppliers demanded high premiums in the May negotiations, another trader said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Japan Aluminium Federation reported that aluminium mill output and shipments rose nearly eight percent in May from a year earlier, with aluminium sheet shipments hitting a record 117,540 tonnes.</p>
<p>It cited demand from the good car sector, exports and beverage can production ahead of the summer season.</p>
<p>Data from the Finance Ministry on Friday also showed Japanese May aluminium imports climbed 1.6 percent to 241,098 tonnes, rising for the fifth straight month.</p>
<p>In the zinc market, premiums for Chinese special high-grade (SHG) remained unchanged at $40-50 per tonne, though some traders noted strong demand from steel makers.</p>
<p>In more key data for the metals industry, the Japan Automobile manufacturers' Association said last week that Japan's vehicle exports rose 28.8 percent in May to 346,532 units from a year earlier, the 12th successive year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>In a separate development, China's Zhuzhou smelter said in a statement that a claim made to the LME that the smelter's Torch brand zinc did not meet the LME's quality standard had been withdrawn by the company involved, allaying some worries here over the metal's price surge to new 6-3/4 year highs last week.</p>
