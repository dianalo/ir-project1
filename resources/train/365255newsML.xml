<p>A man suspected of massacring six people and seriously wounding five others in a shotgun shooting rampage in a rural New Zealnd hamlet is due to appear in court on Sunday or Monday.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old supect, who has not been named by police but was arrested about three hours after the shootings, has been charged with one count of murder and other charges are pending.</p>
<p>Police would realease few details about the killings on Saturday at the hamlet of Raurimu in the central North Island.</p>
<p>They declined to confirm that the massacre took place at a family gathering or that the victims, five men and a woman, included the gunman's parents and other relatives.</p>
<p>&quot;That hasn't been confirmed yet. That's pure speculation. There are indications that they are not necessarily all family members,&quot; said Inspector Jeff Holloway.</p>
<p>&quot;There appears to have been some sort of a trigger for the shooting, but it would certainly be incorrect to say that all the members were family.&quot;</p>
<p>The suspect was arrested naked and unarmed in farmland close to the scene of the killings in Raurimu, a winter holiday resort for skifields at the nearby active volcano of Mount Ruapehu.</p>
<p>Holloway, speaking ahead of a planned police news conference in the nearby town of Taumarunui, said most of the victims were from Wellington.</p>
<p>He would not confirm media reports that the killings happened at three properties -- all holiday lodges -- but he said the shootings were centred on a 200-metre (yard) radius.</p>
<p>&quot;We can confirm that the shootings were centered around accommodation in Raurimu, known as the Raurimu Lodge,&quot; he said &quot;It is my understanding that some of the people that were shot at were occupants of that lodge.&quot;</p>
<p>The names of the victims have yet to be relased. Holloway said he expected the wounded to live but gave no other details.</p>
<p>Police also declined to confirm media reports that the suspected gunman had a history of psychiatric problems.</p>
<p>Asked what triggered the massacre, Holloway said: &quot;We've got no idea yet. We're still working through the various witnesses to the incident.&quot;</p>
<p>The suspect, who was known to police &quot;in a very, very minor way,&quot; has been put under constant supervision and has been medically examined.</p>
<p>The proprietor of a nearby motel, who declined to be identified, told Reuters that some of the suspect's family had been in Raurimu for a reunion.</p>
<p>He understood that the gunman had at one stage fired randomly at oncoming traffic from a bus shelter snd that one of the dead was a young woman who was walking along the road trying to hitch a lift.</p>
<p>&quot;One guy was going to pick her up, then he saw the guy with the shotgun and kept going,&quot; he said. &quot;He looked back and saw the woman getting shot to pieces.&quot;</p>
<p>The shootings, the fifth mass slaughter in New Zealand in the 1990s, led to renewed calls by anti-gun lobbyists for tougher firearms laws.</p>
<p>The highest death toll came in 1990 in the southern hamlet of Aramoana where a crazed gunman killed 13 people with a semi-automatic assault rifle before police shot him dead.</p>
