<p>Recent Bureau of Labor Statistics' adjustments to the core Consumer Price Index likely understated the underlying trend of U.S. inflation in 1996, Goldman, Sachs and Co said on Friday.</p>
<p>Without such adjustments, the year-over-year core CPI would have risen in 1996 by 3.0 percent instead of edging down to 2.5 percent, Goldman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some revisions have already been made, reflecting gradual attempts by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to address some of the problem pointed out by the CPI critics,&quot; Goldman noted in a research work authored by economist Jill Jacobs.  </p>
<p>&quot;We believe year-over-year core CPI inflation would have registered 3.0 percent at yearend 1996, had no revisions occurred,&quot; the Goldman research paper added.</p>
<p>The firm pointed out the adjustments made by the BLS affected the most recent CPI data only and were not applied to core CPI calculations prior to 1995 -- thus skewing downward recent core CPI readings.</p>
<p>Goldman said that, though the BLS adjustments do not yet fully address all CPI biases, &quot;gradual revisions to eliminate a bias are quite important since these cause the pattern of inflation to be disturbed.&quot;  </p>
<p>Goldman made the point the disruption in the pattern of calculating core CPI is important because monetary policy is more influenced by changes in the behavior of inflation rather than by its levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Federal Reserve officials are often more concerned about changes in the pace of inflation than with the absolute rate of price gains,&quot; Jacobs remarked.</p>
<p>Goldman said the BLS adjustments affected the calculation of owners' equivalent rent and &quot;shaved the rate of inflation by more than is commonly perceived,&quot; since such costs account for a hefty 25.4 percent of core CPI.  </p>
<p>Other changes included hospitalization costs and various quality adjustments.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the revision process is complete, inflation could appear to change course, merely by returning to a normal trajectory,&quot; Goldman said. &quot;Further revisions may be in store.&quot;</p>
<p>The firm suggested other U.S. measures of inflation, such as the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) deflator, may give a more accurate picture of inflation trends because the index is based on more up-to-date consumption patterns than the CPI.</p>
<p>&quot;The PCE deflator accelerated slightly in 1996. This pick-up occurred despite the greater weight given to computers, an area where price moves decelerated rapidly in 1995-1996,&quot; Goldman noted.</p>
