<p>the UK ministry of agriculture's estimate for UK wheat export availability has been raised to 4.36 million tonnes in the 1996/97 marketing year (July/June) from a previous 4.2 million, the UK's Home Grown Cereals Authority said.  </p>
<p>With some 3.3 million tonnes of wheat reported as exported by end-March, over one million tonnes would need to be shipped out in the last quarter of this marketing year to prevent a large surplus carryover into 1997-98, the HGCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ministry has cut its feed use forecast for wheat by 320,000 tonnes, leading to the 160,000 tonne increase in export availability, the HGCA said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade estimates generally put the wheat export availability closer to four million tonnes, with lower import, higher animal feed use and lower carry-in stock forecasts than the MAFF (farm ministry) figures&quot; the HGCA said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even so, this still means that a strong pace of exports is required from April to June and therefore UK wheat prices need to remain competitive on export markets,&quot; the HGCA said.</p>
<p>The barley export availability is put at 2.24 million tonnes, with 1.9 million tonnes estimated to have been exported by the end of March, the HGCA said. &quot;With such a small surplus left for the last quarter any intervention offers before June when stores close are expected to be small,&quot; the HGCA said.</p>
<p>Rapeseed crushings have fallen as British crushers have switched to sunflower and soybeans, the HGCA said. Imports of rapeseed are likely to be larger than the ministry forecast of 153,000 tonnes, the HGCA said. --Christopher Lyddon, London newsroom +44 171 542 7928</p>
