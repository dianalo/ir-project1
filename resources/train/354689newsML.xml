<p>Nawaz Sharif, clear winner of Pakistan's elections, on Tuesday urged his beaten opponent Benazir Bhutto to accept defeat gracefully.</p>
<p>&quot;I see no reason why she should not accept these results,&quot; the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) leader told Reuters as he headed for a stunning victory in national and provincial polls.  </p>
<p>With 146 results declared for the 217-seat National Assembly, the PML had won 112 seats for a clear majority. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) had won only seven.</p>
<p>&quot;She must accept the verdict of the people of Pakistan. These were free and fair elections under the observation of foreign observers and the army, which deployed 250,000 men to ensure that there was no rigging,&quot; Sharif said.</p>
<p>&quot;These elections were absolutely fair. She's a bad loser and she must accept this defeat.&quot;</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari called the elections after sacking Bhutto's government on November 5 on disputed charges of corruption and misrule.</p>
