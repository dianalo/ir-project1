<p>Thai rice production in the 1997/98 (April-March) season is still under the threat of drought even though rainfall has improved in many parts of the country, a senior government official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pramote Maiklad, head of the National Water Resources Committee, told Reuters that, despite heavy rains in some areas, many parts of the central and northern regions, Thailand's main rice basket, still faced a prolonged dry spell.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a transition period. We cannot say the drought is over until the rain starts falling regularly,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;While heavy rains are threatening to flood some areas, such as Kanchanaburi, farmers in many central and nothern provinces still cannot plant rice due to insufficient rain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the northeast, Thailand's major fragrant rice producing region, has not been badly affected by drought, he added.</p>
<p>Thailand's rainy season normally started in April or May, followed by a brief dry period in June. It then resumes in July or August.</p>
<p>In recent years, the dry period has become more prolonged.  </p>
<p>Farmers usually start sowing in April and planting in July. This year the dry spell damaged the rice shoots and delayed planting.</p>
<p>The government has instructed farmers to delay planting until August to ensure sufficient water is available.</p>
<p>Pramote said if the rain started to fall regularly now, enabling farmers to plant rice in August, this year's production would be barely affected.</p>
<p>&quot;If the farmers are forced to start growing rice in September due to insuffiecent rains, then there will definitely be problems,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The agricultural ministry has forecast that the 1997/98 first rice crop will top 18 million tonnes, but trade sources said the forecast could be revised downwards in the near future.</p>
<p>Tight supplies have recently pushed Thai rice prices higher and the benchmark 100 percent B grade is now trading around $325-$345 a tonne FOB Bangkok.</p>
