<p>A parliamentary deputy of Sri Lanka's main opposition United National Party (UNP) and five others were killed in an attack by gunmen near eastern Trincomalee town on Sunday, police said.</p>
<p>They said UNP MP Mohammed Moharoof's vehicle was attacked on a stretch of road between Trincomalee and nearby Nilaveli at about 10.30 a.m. (0430 GMT).</p>
<p>The dead included a small child, police said.</p>
<p>No other details were immediately available and police could not identify the gunmen, but UNP sources in the capital Colombo confirmed Moharoof had died in the attack.</p>
<p>Moharoof was the second parliamentary deputy to be killed this month in Trincomalee, 260 km (160 miles) east of Colombo.</p>
<p>Arunasalam Thangathurai, Trincomalee parliamentary deputy for the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), died in a grenade attack on July 5.</p>
<p>Thangathurai, who was killed while entering his vehicle after inaugurating a new school building in Trincomalee, was the eighth TULF leader to die in a series of political assassinations in as many years.</p>
<p>Four others, including the school principal, were also killed and 15 were wounded in the July 5 attack.</p>
<p>Police blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for Thangathurai's killing, but nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>The LTTE are fighting a 13-year-old war for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war. The LTTE puts the toll higher.</p>
