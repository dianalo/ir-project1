<p>The City of Houston and Harris County have approved the creation of a sports authority which will plan financing for a proposed $250 million baseball stadium for the Houston Astros, officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>Barbara Mendel, a spokeswoman for Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, said the sports authority would have 11 members.</p>
<p>The city and the county each would appoint five members to the authority and jointly name its chairman. The appointments are expected to begin next week.</p>
<p>Houston's city council approved the creation of the sports authority late on Wednesday, one day after Harris County gave its nod.</p>
<p>Under the present arrangement, the sports authority cannot spend more than $180 million of taxpayers' money for the baseball park. The remaining $70 million must come from the Astros' owners and other private sector sources.</p>
<p>&quot;The sports authority now becomes the moving entity to take care of the financing part of this project and other facilities. From that perspective, its creation was a significant achievement. But we still have a long way to go,&quot; Mendel said.</p>
<p>The baseball park may still not be built if the Astros do not pick up their share of the facility's estimated cost.</p>
<p>The Astros currently play in the Astrodome, which is owned by Harris County. But the team says the Astrodome is outdated and warns it might be forced to leave the city if it doesn't get a new stadium.</p>
<p>Mendel said public funds for the baseball park would come from car rental taxes, ticket taxes and other user fees. Property taxes will be not be used, she said.</p>
<p>Mendel said the Astros would also pay an annual rent of $4.6 million for the park and for any future cost overruns.</p>
