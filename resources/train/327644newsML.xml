<title>UK: Copper ends firm on LME, spread tightness increase.</title>
<headline>Copper ends firm on LME, spread tightness increase.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices were well supported during Thursday afternoon LME trading by an ever-expanding backwardation, and closed steadier, albeit under the key $2,280 level.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there was a contracting contango in  the aluminium market, which reflected forward borrowing and short dates in April, which lifted prices above the $1,640 level.</p>
<p>The price perforance in the rest of the complex was mixed, although the general undercurrent was steadier on copper's trend.</p>
<p>In copper, the cash/threes backwardation widened out to $290/294 by the end of the kerb, against Wednesday's $250.</p>
<p>The crunch prompt dates are between Jan 29 and the February date, with some of the end-Jan/early-Feb daily rates now around $20, close to the LME's one percent of cash metal daily limit.</p>
<p>Traders said the tightness, which covers around two weeks, reflects a combination of genuine physical shortages, major short positions from a speculative sell-off in autumn 1996, and merchant players taking advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three months prices repeatedly stalled at the $2,280 level, finishing the kerb at $2,277 a tonne, up $15 from Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A close above $2,280 would have been mega-bullish on the charts, but I think it is heading that way. The next $50 on copper is likely to be on the upside,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>If $2,280 is cleared, the psychological target is $2,300, although the key overhead objective will be $2,313 - the late November 1996 high.</p>
<p>Once through here prices will be back to levels last seen in June 1996, when the market was in full retreat as the Sumitomo scandal unfolded.</p>
<p>In aluminium, attention centred on short April dates, notably around April 9. There is also talk that significant tonnages of metal will be drawn out of warehouses in coming weeks, they said.</p>
<p>This pulled in the cash/threes contango to $24/25 by the close from $30 on Wednesday. Three months prices pushed above the $1,640 level to end $12 higher at $1,642 and are now set for further gains.</p>
<p>Zinc continued to erode reistance just above $1,150 and closed the day at $1,151, up $1, but lead was quiet and drifted to close at $712, down $1.</p>
<p>Nickel recovered from yesterday's softness, rallying on some covering to finish at $7,385, up $105. Tin continued to build a base above $6,000, and was $30 higher at $6,050.</p>
<p>The aluminium alloy market was indicated at a slightly steadier $1,535/40 a tonne. --Martin Hayes, London Newsroom 44 171 542 8080</p>
