<p>Chemical group Akzo Nobel NV gave the following details of how its four main product groups performed in the third quarter of 1996: CHEMICALS --</p>
<p>At NLG 124 million, Chemicals' operating income was down NLG 21 million from last year's third quarter. This decline was mainly due to lower results of Pulp and Paper Chemicals and a disappointing performance of Surface Chemistry, which is still confronted with overcapacity in Europe, as well as of the VCM/PVC activities, which suffer from low selling prices. Better results of Functional Chemicals afforded some compensation.  </p>
<p>COATINGS --</p>
<p>Operating income of Coatings increased considerably from NLG 146 million to NLG 201 million this quarter, up almost 40 percent. All business units contributed to this gain, which was mainly brought about by ongoing efficiency improvements. The results of the integration of the coatings activities of Akzo and Nobel are now clearly evident. Margins recovered to a more acceptable level.  </p>
<p>PHARMACEUTICALS--</p>
<p>At NLG 190 million, Pharma's operating earnings were marginally higher than in last year's third quarter. Organon's sales declined due to lower volume in birth control pills, as a consequence of the scientific debate over oral contraceptives at the end of last year. We trust that growth for this product group will resume soon. The results were also affected by additional costs associated with promising new product launches, such as fertility hormone Puregon and antidepressant Remeron.</p>
<p>Lower Organon results were compensated, however, by greater contributions from Intervet (veterinary products) and Diosynth (specialised raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry). The performance gain of these two business units was largely attributable to higher sales volumes.  </p>
<p>FIBRES--</p>
<p>In the face of adverse market conditions Fibres achieved a positive operating income in the third quarter. Viscose textile yarns, in particular, were affected by these difficult conditions. Measures are being taken to deal with these problems. They include the relocation of textile finishing from Obernburg, Kelsterbach, and Ede to Gorzow in Poland. The results of operations in Brazil have been disappointing this year.</p>
