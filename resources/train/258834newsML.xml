<headline>Indiana's Sen. Coats to retire in 1998.</headline>
<dateline>FORT WAYNE, Ind. 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said Monday he would not run for re-election when his term ends in 1998, opening the way for Democrat Evan Bayh to reclaim the seat once held by his father.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to leave when I am young enough to contribute somewhere else -- young enough to resume a career outside government,&quot; Coats, 53, said in a statement. He has served in the Senate since 1989, when he was appointed to replace Dan Quayle after Quayle became vice president.</p>
<p>Coats, a believer in congressional term limits, served eight years in the House before joining the Senate, where he is one of its most conservative members.</p>
<p>He said he would spend the next two years speaking out about his concerns for the country's future.</p>
<p>&quot;I will continue to challenge my own party on its responsibilities to the poor, to speak strongly for the value and dignity of human life, to be an advocate for children and families,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Coats ushered through a series of bills under the umbrella of the American Family Act that called for private charitable support for poor families to replace government welfare programmes. He also spoke out strongly against government funding for the arts, and helped pass legislation limiting states from exporting trash to other states.</p>
<p>Coats is the first of 33 senators up for re-election in 1998 to announce he will not run again. Next year, Republicans will hold 55 Senate seats to the Democrats' 45.</p>
<p>Outgoing Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh, who has set up an exploratory committee to consider a run for the Senate, was considered a strong candidate for the seat his father, Birch Bayh, held until he was defeated by Quayle in 1980. The elder Bayh was the last Democratic senator from Indiana, although the state will have a Democratic governor and four out of 10 members of Congress are Democrats.</p>
<p>In an early state-wide poll conducted recently, Bayh held a large lead over Coats in their potential 1998 matchup, although Coats was known to be a resourceful campaigner with strong fund-raising abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;Anybody who says Dan Coats got out because he was scared of Evan Bayh is flat wrong,&quot; Joe Andrew, Indiana's Democratic Party chairman, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sen. Coats and Gov. Bayh have always been good friends and worked well together. To most of us, it's not a surprise that he's getting out; he's always been a supporter of term limits,&quot; Andrew said.</p>
<p>Coats won an interim election for Quayle's seat in 1990, then beat back a challenge from Joe Hogsett, a popular state secretary of state, to win re-election in 1992.</p>
<p>Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith was among the state Republicans considered to have a chance to grab the party's nomination for Coats' seat, although he was defeated handily in the November election to succeed Bayh as governor. State law prevented Bayh, seen as a rising star in the party who was keynote speaker at the Democratic Party convention in August, from running for governor again.</p>
<p>Indiana's other Senate seat has been held by Richard Lugar, 64, since 1976. Lugar's fourth term expires in 2000.</p>
