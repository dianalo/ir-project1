<title>USA: CenterPoint focusing on leases due in 1997.</title>

<text>
<p>CenterPoint Properties Corp, reporting higher third quarter results, said on Wednesday it would soon renew or replace the last of its 1996 leases and is now focusing on leases coming due in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to renew or replace the last 1996 lease expirations shortly, which we view as a consequence of our high level of tenant satisfaction and our franchise in the Chicago market,&quot; said Bobby Stovall, chief operating officer of the real estate investment trust. &quot;We are now focusing on leases expiring in 1997.&quot;  </p>
<p>CenterPoint said 87 percent of its 1996-expiring leases had been renewed or replaced as of September 30.</p>
<p>The new leases reflect an average 10.5 percent rental rate increase, it said.</p>
<p>CenterPoint, which focuses on industrial property, said its total portfolio is 98 percent leased.</p>
<p>CenterPoint said $25 million of cash proceeds from a recent equity offering was allocated to its Northlake Industrial Center re-development. Delays in closing this transaction reduced third quarter funds from operations (FFO) by about $0.02 a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Going forward, this and other recent investments will significantly enhance per share FFO,&quot; John Gates, chief executive officer, said in a statement. &quot;CenterPoint's high and sustained growth rate, when combined with our lower leverage and vastly improved financial flexibility, leaves room for improvement in multiple and share valuation as the market begins to focus on 1997.&quot;</p>
