<p>Poverty-stricken Laos is on track towards achieving 7.5 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1996 while inflation is easing sharply, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We see that growth continues to be high,&quot; Paul Wade, IMF's representative in communist Laos, told Reuters by telephone from the capital city Vientiane.</p>
<p>The figure conformed with earlier IMF forecast of 7.5 percent GDP growth and is slightly higher than that of the Laotian Ministry of Finance, which earlier this month predicted GDP growth for 1996 to reach 7.1 percent.</p>
<p>Wade said the monthly rate of inflation had been reduced from 27 and 29 percent in January and February respectively to only 4.5 percent at the end of August this year.</p>
<p>The government hopes to achieve an average 12 percent inflation rate for all of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;On the inflation rate it's very good news,&quot; he said about the latest rate for August.</p>
<p>Inflation soared to a high of 19 percent in 1995 resulting from a sustained budget deficit, a weaker kip and rising imports.</p>
<p>The IMF launched a $54 million, three-year loan programme with Laos in June 1993.</p>
