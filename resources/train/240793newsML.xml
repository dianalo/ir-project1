<p>Miami city commissioners have agreed to $34.4 million of the budget cuts needed to close the city's $68 million deficit, Miami Herald reported Friday.</p>
<p>In a day-long meeting Thursday, City Manager Ed Marquez led commissioners and city department heads through a recovery plan that calls for spending cuts in city departments, park closures and union concessions.</p>
<p>Commissioners agreed to the proposals and also demanded additional cuts of 15 percent in every department, a move department heads said would require layoffs.</p>
<p>Commissioners planned to meet on Saturday to tackle the revenue-enhancement part of the recovery plan.</p>
<p>Miami has spent more money than it raises for years. On Tuesday, Gov. Lawton Chiles declared the city was in a fiscal crisis and said he would appoint an advisory board to oversee its recovery.</p>
<p>Chiles aide Joe Pena attended Thursday's commission meeting and left with mixed feelings, saying some department heads appeared unprepared.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have liked to have seen the directors more knowledgeable,&quot; Pena said. &quot;I can understand they're not ready to jump into anything right away, but we are insisting they adopt a comprehensive plan that takes into account the structural deficit and addresses these issues. The clock's been ticking for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Commissioners indicated they could approve a small increase in garbage collection fees. The original proposal called for doubling the fee to $320 a year, which would raise $10 million annually. Three of the five commissioners oppose the plan, saying it could pose a financial hardship for Miami's poor.</p>
<p>But three of the city's four employee unions have already agreed to wage concessions that are contingent upon the garbage fee increase. The city's labor relations officer, Sue Weller, said there could be legal challenges if the commission does not adopt the fee hike.</p>
