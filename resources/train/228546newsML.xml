<p>Moody's Investors Service cut Miami's general obligation bond rating to Ba1 from Baa on Monday, and said it had been advised by Florida officials that a state takeover of the city was &quot;imminent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were told by the state officials that that's imminent, either late today or early tomorrow,&quot; Moody's vice president John Incorvaia said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not doing anything tonight,&quot; Gov Lawton Chiles spokeswoman Karen Pankowski said. &quot;Call us tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The rating cut means the city's GO bonds below investment grade and indicates they &quot;are judged to have speculative elements.&quot;</p>
<p>Incorvaia cited Miami Mayor Joe Carollo's meeting with Gov Chiles last week as a factor in the downgrade. Carollo told the governor the city had a financial crisis and said he would welcome the appointment of an emergency board to run the city.</p>
<p>&quot;Having gone to the governor is indicative of the severity of the budget crisis, coupled with the political resistance to enact relatively moderate revenue enhancement proposals,&quot; Incorvaia said. &quot;All this makes it appear increasingly questionable that the city will be able to restore fiscal balance without some outside intervention.&quot;</p>
<p>Miami has a $68 million deficit in its $275 million budget for the year that began Oct 1.</p>
<p>The govenor has previously criticized the city commission for failing to quickly enact fee hikes that could help balance the budget.</p>
