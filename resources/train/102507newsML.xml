<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat made his first public visit to Israel on Tuesday to underline a renewed Israeli-Palestinian commitment to settle disputes through negotiation instead of violence.</p>
<p>Although the former guerrilla leader expressed disappointment with Israel's approach to the latest peace talks before leaving Gaza by helicopter, he was smiling broadly when met on arrival in Caesarea by Israeli President Ezer Weizman.</p>
<p>&quot;We are determined to continue with this road of a new Middle East that will be devoid of wars, violence and counter-violence,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;Negotiations will be the tool to resolve our differences,&quot; Arafat said after a 25-minute meeting with Weizman, a former defence minister who became an advocate of peace with the Arabs.</p>
<p>Weizman, whose role is largely ceremonial, had announced plans two months ago to invite Arafat when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was still refusing to see the Palestinian leader.</p>
<p>But the meeting, which was only scheduled on Monday, was timed to coincide with the resumption of peace talks after an emergency summit in Washington last week.</p>
<p>Violence sparked by Netanyahu's opening of an archaeological tunnel near Islamic sites in Jerusalem last month cost the lives of 59 Palestinians and 15 Israelis.</p>
<p>Weizman greeted Arafat, wearing his khaki uniform and chequered keffiyeh, at the entrance to his whitewashed villa in seaside Caesaria. Arafat's smile contrasted with the grim expression seen when he was beside Netanyahu at the summit.</p>
<p>The Palestinian leader's only previous visit to Israel -- a condolence call on the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last November -- was at night and without advance announcement.</p>
<p>Arafat struck all the right chords in a country shaken by the sight of Palestinian policemen exchanging fire with Israeli soldiers. Weizman said they spoke about &quot;the recent tragedy of gunfire, losses on both sides and we decided this kind of thing cannot happen again&quot;.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Netanyahu told Israel Radio he expected the two men would discuss Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome any effort or contribution that can advance the peace process and Israel's interests in it,&quot; Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said of Weizman inviting Arafat to his home.</p>
<p>An easing of tension was also signalled by Israel lifting a blockade on the West Bank town of Ramallah near Jerusalem and allowing the entry of the first Palestinian workers from Gaza since the fighting.</p>
<p>But Palestinians expressed little optimism about the talks on Hebron, which resumed on Tuesday. Palestinian negotiators said basic differences had surfaced at Monday's first session.</p>
<p>The government that Netanyahu defeated in May elections had signed a commitment to thin forces in Hebron, a city of 100,000 Arabs and 400 militant Jewish settlers, nearly seven months ago.</p>
<p>Israel, while maintaining it is not trying to reopen the Hebron agreement, says it needs better security for Jewish settlers in the city. But Palestinians said Israeli proposals could undermine the entire peace process.</p>
<p>Arafat, who wants Israel to honour the agreement with only minor adjustments, said of the Monday session: &quot;I'm sorry it was not positive but we hope something new will happen today.&quot;</p>
