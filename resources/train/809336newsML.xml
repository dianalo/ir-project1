<p>CSCE coffee futures were called to open 0.50 cent higher Tuesday as traders expect the market to follow through on Monday's firmer close.</p>
<p>New York arabicas erased early losses and ended mostly higher in light trading Monday. September arabicas settled up 2.25 cents at 180.20 cents a lb after ranging from 181.00 to 175.00 cents. Active December ended 1.10 cents higher at 162.95 cents, while the back months closed up 0.90 to down 0.60 cent.</p>
<p>September/December widened to 17.25 cents compared with 16.10 cents at the close Friday. December/March 1998 stretched to 15.95 cents versus 15.75 cents the previous session.</p>
<p>Technically, traders pegged September resistance at 182.50 cents and then 187.00 cents. Support was seen at 175.00 cents, followed by 172.50-172.00 cents.</p>
<p>After Monday's close, CSCE reported exchange-certified coffee stocks rose by 457 60-kg bags as of August 15, to 92,428 bags. An additional 5,500 bags of coffee were pending grading.</p>
<p>On the fundamental front, truck drivers in Colombia's main transport union declared a strike at the Colombian port of Buenaventura to protest low freight rates.</p>
<p>But sources at the port, which handles 60 percent of Colombia's trade, including coffee exports, said operations were not affected.</p>
<p>London robusta futures were higher early Tuesday in switch-dominated trade. LIFFE November rose $42 at the midday break, to $1,525, after ranging from $1,530 to $1,485. Spot September was up $39, to $1,500.</p>
