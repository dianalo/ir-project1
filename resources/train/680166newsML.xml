<p>&quot;Some foreign funds were buying back shares after a heavy selloff last week. Local investors and mutual funds also appeared to join the bandwagon,&quot; said one broker at Nava Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>The broker said the hefty gains posted on Friday also helped spark investor interest to continue buying today.</p>
<p>Thai stocks rose 3.33 percent on Friday after the naming of new finance minister Thanong Bidaya, brokers said, although his appointment was seen as neutral by the market.</p>
<p>Gainers outnumbered losers 236 to 74 with 68 unchanged.  </p>
<p>Bank shares which came under selling pressure last week on concern about their low-quality assets and loan portfolios led the market gains and were up eight percent.</p>
