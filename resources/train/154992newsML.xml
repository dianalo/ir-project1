<p>Police in the north Australian state of Queensland said on Wednesday they were investigating two attacks on visiting soldiers from Singapore, but said they did not believe the incidents were racially motivated.</p>
<p>Chief superintendent Wayne King of the Rockhampton city police told Reuters the police were investigating one incident of assault in which a soldier received a blow to the head, and another of assault and robbery.</p>
<p>&quot;We're only investigating two matters that have been reported to us and one of them certainly has no racial overtones and the second one, who knows?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Queensland town mayor, Barbara Wildin, was quoted as saying in one newspaper report on Wednesday that there had been five &quot;major&quot; unprovoked attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;I think these incidents come from this nonsense put up by Pauline Hanson,&quot; Wildin said, referring to an independent Queensland MP waging an anti-immigration campaign.</p>
<p>But King, from the Rockhampton police, said: &quot;We're not aware of any racial overtones in relation to the Singapore soldiers that are here. Really I think it's just a thing that has been blown all out of proportion by some comments that have been made.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Rockhampton council, Russell Peate, said there had been a few &quot;minor incidents&quot; -- including one in which eggs were thrown at Singaporean women -- but he did not think they could be linked with Hanson.</p>
<p>He said the visiting Singapore soldiers brought an estimated A$20 million ($15.8 million) boost to the local economy, adding: It's unfortunate that the city of Rockhampton and surrounding areas have been portrayed as being racially intolerant.&quot;</p>
<p>Around 1000 members of the Singapore Armed Forces are in Australia for a major exercise in the Australian Defence Forces' training area near Rockhampton on the central Queensland coast.</p>
<p>Australian Defence Minister Ian McLachlan also said reports of racially motivated attacks against Singapore soldiers were greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>&quot;But whatever the cause, we regard any instance like this as an abomination and extremely regrettable,&quot; McLachlan told parliament.</p>
<p>He said the joint exercises had been successful and were likely to increase in the future.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Singapore High Commissioner Lieutenant General Winston Choo had raised his concerns over the incidents with his department.</p>
<p>He added that he planned to use a meeting later on Wednesday with Singapore's foreign, defence and trade ministers to reassure them that Australia was opposed to racism.</p>
<p>&quot;In those discussions I will be making it clear that obviously incidents such as those that occurred are deeply regrettable and of course, quite clearly offensive,&quot; Downer said.</p>
