<p>Bad weather on Wednesday forced Japan's Maritime Safety Agency to scale back efforts to limit further leakage from a tanker that has already caused the country's worst-ever oil spill.</p>
<p>High seas forced the agency to halt the pumping of oil from the bow of the tanker, which lies about 100 metres from shore near the west-coast fishing town of Mikuni, about 320 km (200 miles) west of Tokyo.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of heavy seas, only our larger boats can carry on with the cleanup operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Authorities said an inspection showed oil tanks in the bow of the tanker, which split in two in stormy seas on January 2, were intact.</p>
<p>But the stern of the 26-year-old Nakhodka, which held most of the 19,000-tonne (133,000-barrel) cargo of heavy oil, is believed to be leaking. It went down about 130 kilometres (80 miles) offshore but authorities have yet to pinpoint its location in deep water.</p>
<p>A steady upwelling of oil continues to spread across the ocean surface near the site where officials believe the stern sank, forming a slick 7 km (4 miles) by 200 metres.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sent a survey boat out to try to locate the stern of the tanker in the region where we think it sank,&quot; the agency spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;As it may be up to 1.8 kilometres (1.2 miles) deep, there's nothing we can do,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The oil continues to spread along Japan's west coast, polluting rich fishing grounds and tourist beaches. It has also hit at least two bird sanctuaries.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the agency said oil slicks have spread north past the tip of the Noto Peninsula, which had previously marked the northern extent of the oil pollution, and were spreading gradually.</p>
<p>Japanese environmental officials have appealed for volunteers to clean up bird sanctuaries smeared with oil.</p>
<p>Oil-covered beaches on Kanmurijima Island, 10 km (six miles) off the Kyoto region, threaten 600,000 birds. The 23-hectare (58-acre) island is the summer nesting ground for white-faced shear waters, relatives of the seagull which migrate only to Japan in the northern hemisphere, arriving on the island in February after spending the winter at feeding grounds in southern Asia.</p>
<p>Environment Agency officials also said oil damage was inevitable at nesting grounds for 6,000 birds on Nanatsujima Island bird sanctuary, off the Noto Peninsula. Up to 6,000 crested murrelets nest on the island each year.</p>
<p>Maritime agency and nuclear plant officials were battling rough seas to continue a cleanup of oil slicks near a cluster of nuclear reactors around Wakasa bay, the official said.</p>
<p>New slicks and solid clumps of oil continued to drift up to a ring of oil fences erected to protect 15 nuclear reactors scattered around Wakasa Bay, the world's highest concentration of nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Nuclear plant officials said the fences had so far succeeded in keeping oil from intake pipes which draw in seawater to serve as a vital coolant for the reactors.</p>
<p>Russian ambassador to Japan Alexandre Panov on Tuesday apologised for the spill caused by the privately owned tanker.</p>
<p>The 31-man crew of the tanker, which was heading from China to Russia, was rescued. The captain is missing and presumed dead.</p>
<p>Japan's Transport Ministry said on Tuesday it would toughen checks on foreign vessels stopping at Japan's ports because of an increase in disasters at sea.</p>
