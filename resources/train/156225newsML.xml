<p>Shooting broke out inside Liberia's Executive Mansion presidential complex on Thursday and witnesses said panic had gripped the capital.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was an attack on the mansion and shooting broke out,&quot; one witness said. &quot;Shops, businesses, markets and schools closed hurriedly and traffic came to a halt. People started running helter skelter, some with their belongings.&quot;</p>
<p>The cause of the firing was not clear but troops of the ECOMOG African peacekeeping force moved in with tanks.</p>
<p>At least two wounded people were taken to the nearby Barclay Training Centre army barracks, witnesses said. BTC was the bastion of ethnic Krahn guerrillas at the heart of militia warfare in the capital last April and May.</p>
