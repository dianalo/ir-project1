<p>Italy's welfare state needs rebalancing but without cutting overall social spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, cabinet secretary Enrico Micheli said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is to rebalance social welfare expenditure logically without reducing the percentage of GDP but by working on an internal balancing out of spending,&quot; he told a joint social affairs commission of the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Micheli said that despite substantial welfare improvements in recent years, the system &quot;needs further rebalancing from 1998,&quot; particularly with the full introduction over time of a contribution-based system.</p>
<p>Micheli noted that social spending in Italy &quot;is on the whole not dissimilar from that of other European countries.&quot; But there was a &quot;major imbalance in the structure.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that in Italy 61.5 percent of social spending went on pensions and 18.4 percent on social welfare, against a European Union average of 45.3 percent and 31.9 percent repectively.</p>
<p>He noted that according to World Bank data, &quot;in the year 2000 Italy will have the highest dependency ratio (of people drawing pensions against people in active employment) among G-7 nations.</p>
<p>&quot;In 50 years, the dependency ratio in Italy will be equal to 60 percent compared with an average 46.5 percent in other G-7 countries,&quot; he added.</p>
