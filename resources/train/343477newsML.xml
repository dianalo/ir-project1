<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin returned to the Kremlin on Thursday for talks intended to show demonstrate he is retaining command of the ship of state while recovering from pneumonia.</p>
<p>In late morning Yeltsin's limousine with its presidential flag swept at high speed through Moscow, led by a four-wheel drive car packed with bodyguards. The flashing lights and siren aroused little interest among passers by.</p>
<p>Official television footage showed Yeltsin smiling broadly as he received Constitutional Court chairman Vladimir Tumanov in his office for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>He moved slowly to his table. The film was then cut to show him sitting with Tumanov and talking in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>At one point, the president, speaking in his characteristic low, growling voice, appeared to be expressing a desire to return to a more active life.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't hurry,&quot; Tumanov could be heard saying.</p>
<p>In a brief interview following the shots of Yeltsin, Tumanov added: &quot;He looks better in real life than he does on television...though it is clear that the illness is still having its effect on him.&quot;</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin might hold several more meetings on Friday, including one with his chief of staff Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>It was Yeltsin's third visit to the Kremlin since he was released from hospital on January 20 after treatment for pneumonia. He has been spending most of his time in the secluded Gorky-9 official residence outside Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who turns 66 on Saturday and is due to hold talks outside Moscow with French President Jacques Chirac on Sunday, has visited the Kremlin only rarely since he won a second term in office on July 3.</p>
<p>He was absent with heart problems for most of the second half of last year -- he underwent open heart surgery on November 5 -- and he fell ill again with pneumonia on January 6.</p>
<p>The president's long absence has fuelled speculation that he is too ill to rule Russia, and a brief appearance on television on Tuesday did little to calm the rumour mill.</p>
<p>Yeltsin looked alert in the television footage, but he had clearly lost a lot of weight since he fell ill. The film was heavily edited, making it hard to judge his state of health.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's opponents have been lobbying for him to step down.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Deputies in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, discussed a motion to force Yeltsin out of office for health reasons, although Duma legal experts say it has little chance of success under the constitution.</p>
<p>Aides say Yeltsin has mainly been working on papers since he left hospital. A major topic is the annual state of the nation address to both houses of parliament, expected late next month.</p>
<p>He has also discussed Monday's presidential election in rebel Chechnya, in which the relatively moderate Aslan Mashadov has emerged as the clear winner. Moscow has ruled out his demands for secession and faces tough negotiations on the issue.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, acting on doctors' orders, has cancelled a trip to the Netherlands next week to meet European Commission leaders, but he is due to meet Chirac at a country residence outside Moscow on Sunday.</p>
<p>Chirac will be the first Western leader to see Yeltsin since he had pneumonia. NATO's plans to expand eastwards into eastern and central Europe, which are opposed by Russia, are expected to be the major issue at the brief talks.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's deputy under the constitution, left Moscow on Wednesday to attend the World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos.</p>
