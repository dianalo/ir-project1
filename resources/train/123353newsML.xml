<p>Argentine bonds rose in volatile trade Thursday in nervous market conditions influenced by the performance of Russian debt, internal politics and strong U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>The negative impacts of the dismissal of Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and domestic political clashes were outweighed by calmer Mexican markets and strong U.S. markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people are confused&quot; about the market, said a trader at an Argentine bank. Another trader noted that there were no real flows in the market this session but rather paper changing hands between brokers.</p>
<p>The dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.25 to 118.40, while Argentina's FRB due 2005 was up 5/8 at 82-1/8.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very cautious&quot; because of the cocktail of uncertainties acting on it, said the second trader.</p>
<p>Even though few traders see any direct consequences of allegations by former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo that two ministers covered up corruption and manipulated judges, there is little doubt it has created a backdrop of insecurity.</p>
<p>The accusations &quot;put investors on edge,&quot; said an analyst.</p>
<p>Traders anticipated the uncertainty could linger for some days and if the Russian political situation gets more complicated by the dismissal of Lebed it could add to investor wariness.</p>
<p>Still, traders and analysts pointed out that the medium-term economic outlook for Argentina remains supportive of bonds.</p>
<p>In the money markets, call money rates rose to 7.50 percent from 6.95 percent.</p>
