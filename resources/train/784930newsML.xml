<p>Shares of Guangdong Brewery Holdings Ltd, a unit of Guangdong Investment Ltd, are poised for a strong debut on Friday, aided by strong parent backing and hopes of asset injections, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Its debut is seen to be strong. There is still a great demand for a quality red-chip, especially as the company is backed up by well-known Guangdong Investment,&quot; said Pamela Lam, analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said the recent strong demand for Chinese parent backed companies would boost performance of the issue.</p>
<p>Guangdong Brewery offered 350 million shares at HK$1.80 each. Some 218.4 million shares were offered to Guangdong Investment's existing shareholders and 35 million shares were offered to the employees.</p>
<p>A further 96.6 million shares offered for public subscription was 38.5 times oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Analysts said a warm subscription response had indicated strong investor strong interest.</p>
<p>However, some said a relatively high offer price could dampen investor interest in the short run.</p>
<p>&quot;The subscription response was okay but not as exciting as before,&quot; said Ben Kwong, director of research of Dharmala Securities. &quot;Concern over its relatively high price to earnings multiple (P.E.) can dampen its upside in the short run.&quot;</p>
<p>The issue was offered at a proforma fully-diluted P.E. of 20.9 times.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of its future earnings growth and possible injection of assets, it is worth holding for long term investment,&quot; Lam said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's earnings outlook was seen strong due to an expected rise in beer consumption, in line with economic growth in China.</p>
<p>Guangdong Brewery is involved in production, distribution, and sales of &quot;Kingway&quot; beer.</p>
<p>The company has two production plants in Shenzhen and it plans to produce 400,000 tonnes of beer by early 1998.</p>
<p>It also has a sales network of about 200 distributors located across the country.</p>
<p>The company forecasts its profit to be not less than HK$90 million for the year ending in December 1997, up from HK$62.27 million profit in 1996.</p>
