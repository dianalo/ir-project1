<p>Wall Street was expected to edge lower on Friday following the release of U.S. unemployment data which showed a drop in the unemployment rate and an upward revision to the number of jobs added in April.</p>
<p>The Labor Department reported that 138,000 new jobs were created last month, down from a revised increase of 323,000 in April.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent versus 4.9 percent in the previous month.</p>
<p>Economists had forecast 219,000 new jobs to have been created and a jobless rate of five percent.  </p>
<p>The data, which showed the U.S. unemployment rate fell in May to its lowest level in more than 23 years, will fuel fears of tight labor markets, wage inflation and higher interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a stronger-than-expected report on a number of levels,&quot; Phil Orlando, chief investment officer of Value Line's Asset Management division, said.  &quot;I think bonds are going to sell off further and I think equities are going to follow suit.&quot;  </p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which tumbled after the release of the data, recovered slightly to trade down 9/32 at a 6.90 percent yield.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures index was off 1.10 points at 844.70.</p>
<p>Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood, said:  &quot;Unless there is something unusual to explain those numbers, we can can expect to see this market get a case of the interest-rate jitters, and that will take some of the focus off earnings expectations.&quot;</p>
<p>He said recent auto strikes could have skewed the data.</p>
