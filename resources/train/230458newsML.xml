<headline>TENNIS-KRAJICEK MAKES $126 PER SECOND -- FOR LOSING.</headline>
<dateline>MUNICH, Germany 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>There are few sports where a competitor can earn more than $126 a second for losing.</p>
<p>But Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek did exactly that at the $6 million Grand Slam Cup on Tuesday after a miserable performance in the first round of the most lucrative event in tennis.</p>
<p>The Dutchman, who is due for knee surgery next week, provided little opposition to American MaliVai Washington in a first-round match in which he was beaten 6-1 6-2 in just 46 minutes.</p>
<p>It was a re-match of this year's Wimbledon final but provided little entertainment for the Munich crowd who whistled their disapproval at the finish.</p>
<p>The Cup brings together the top performers from the four grand slams -- Wimbledon and the French, U.S. and Australian Opens. When it first started in 1990, some of the players said the money on offer was &quot;obscene&quot;.</p>
<p>As a winner of one of the grand slams, Krajicek was guaranteed $250,000 for just turning up in Munich, plus $100,000 for being a first-round loser.</p>
<p>Asked if there was something wrong with his knee, Krajicek said: &quot;No. If there was something the matter, it was more in my brain. I just wasn't sharp at all. Unfortunately I just didn't play the tennis I wanted to play.&quot;</p>
