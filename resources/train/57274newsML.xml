<headline>F.O. LICHT - Daily sugar report.</headline>
<text>
<p>The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>SUGAR: World market for September 13 - Ample supplies of white sugar coupled with a weaker trend in New York pushed world white sugar prices in London lower. October lost $7.30 to close at $339.00. Other months were between $4.40 and $2.50 lower.</p>
<p>In New York raw sugar futures suffered heavy losses in technical trading. Traders claimed weakness in the October contract on today's options expiry. The bulk of options activity centred around the strike price of 11.50 cents/lb. The October contract settled 25 points weaker at 11.64 cents/lb while March eased 22 points to end at 11.45 cents/lb.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see whether the market will recover on Monday from the setback on Friday.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>FRANCE - The latest beet test results of September 13, 1996 showed a weak increase in root weight while sugar content developed favourably. Total root weight rose by 6.33 tonnes to 54.53 tonnes per ha against 58.27 tonnes in 1995. Sugar content increased by 1.34 percentage points to 17.21 per cent, up from 16.98 per cent attained in 1995.</p>
<p>This resulted in a theoretical sugar weight per ha of 9.38 tonnes, white value, 5.7 per cent down on last year's 9.95 tonnes. The weight of foliage is also rather low at 37.43 tonnes compared to 36.69 tonnes in 1995 and 41.67 tonnes in 1994. Despite the increase in sugar weight, the overall results are still far from being encouraging and France continues to expect an unsatisfactory harvest.</p>
<p>NORTHERN GERMANY - Latest beet test results from northern Germany of September 11 confirm that the persistent dryness has affected further beet growth. Beet weight per ha amounted to no more than 54.8 tonnes, down from 63.5 tonnes in 1995 while sugar content reached 16.70 per cent against 16.00 per cent in 1995.</p>
<p>This resulted in a theoretical sugar weight of 9.16 tonnes, white value, per ha, 10.2 per cent less than the previous year's 10.20 tonnes. Due to the rather high number of plants per ha (86,709 vs 78,900 in 1995) and the good weight of foliage, there still seems to be some potential for recovery.</p>
<p>IRELAND - The latest beet test results from Ireland (September 13) confirm that this year's crop will again yield excellent results. Beet weight per ha amounted to 51.81 tonnes, up from last year's 46.67 tonnes and the five-year average (1991/95) of 46.37 tonnes. Sugar content reached 15.42 per cent against 16.46 per cent in 1995 and the average of 15.38 per cent.</p>
<p>This resulted in a theoretical sugar weight of 7.99 tonnes, white value, per ha, 4 per cent up last year's 7.68 tonnes and also higher than the average of 7.15 tonnes. Although the test indicates that the beets are in better shape than last year, overall production will be somewhat lower due to a lower area sown to beet.</p>
<p>HUNGARY - The beet test results of September 13 confirm that the country will only have a slightly lower beet harvest despite a significant fall in the area sown to beet. Average root weight reached 824 grams, up almost 40 per cent on last year's 591 grams. Sugar content amounted to 13.5 per cent, down from 15.0 per cent in 1995.</p>
<p>Due to the good root weight, sugar per root reached 111,2 grams against 88.7 grams in 1995, an increase of more than 25 per cent. Weight of foliage also is rather high at 380 grams per root against 284 grams in 1995.</p>
<p>According to the latest estimate by the Agriculture Ministry, Hungary heads for a sugar beet crop of 4.2 million tonnes, slightly down from last year's 4.4 million tonnes.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>Tunisia bought 14,000 tonnes of high-quality 45 ICUMSA white sugar for arrival in February/March 1997 at $374.00 per tonne. Further details were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Syria's General Foreign Trade Organization for Chemicals and Foodstuffs (GEZA) has issued an international tender to buy 13,000 tonnes of white sugar and 13,000 tonnes of raws for shipment during October/November. September 25 is the final date for price offers.</p>
