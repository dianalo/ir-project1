<title>ROMANIA: Bucharest share prices drift down in thin volumes.</title>
<headline>Bucharest share prices drift down in thin volumes.</headline>

<p>Trading on the Bucharest bourse was modest at the week's second session on Thursday, with most prices going down under thin investor interest.</p>
<p>Turnover fell slightly to 54.1 million lei from 56.1 million the previous session.</p>
<p>The little investor interest there was focused on state fertiliser maker Azomures SA and Artrom SA engineering company.</p>
<p>&quot;Today was business as usual. Low demand, most of it stuck on Azomures and Artrom,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Azomures took half the turnover and Artrom traded 4,458 of the total 10,815 shares which changed hands on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;With company news so scarce, prices only move under the impact of demand-to-supply ratio. Supply was larger today and most prices slipped,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Azomures closed 400 lei weaker at 10,500 and Artrom softened to 2,150 lei from 2,300 lei.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected further selling pressure for next week's sessions, with prices touching new lows.</p>
<p>Two independent value-weighted indices on Thursday showed drops from the previous session. The VAB, computed by  Vanguard SA securities company, and the BIG, compiled by  Bucharest Investment Group SA brokerage house were 5.2 percent down.</p>
<p>Their base was 1,000 points last November.</p>
