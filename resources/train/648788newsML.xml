<title>USA: State attorneys general tobacco session cancelled.</title>
<headline>State attorneys general tobacco session cancelled.</headline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>A meeting of state attorneys general that had been set for Tuesday in Dallas to discuss developments in tobacco settlement negotiations has been cancelled, a key negotiator said late Sunday night.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore told Reuters he had instead returned to Washington with other negotiators in the hope of finding resolutions to major sticking points, including the tobacco industry's demand that it be protected from punitive damages.</p>
<p>Moore said the states' top legal officers have refused to agree to a proposal that would deny individuals a right to pursue such damages, which are awarded to punish or deter certain activities.</p>
<p>&quot;We told them we won't give it up, and they say they want it,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Moore said that talks were &quot;tough&quot; at this point, but progress was being made and that he remained hopeful a deal could be reached. &quot;I think we'll get there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, others involved in the talks were less optimistic. One source said there was concern that negotiations could unravel during the week.</p>
<p>There are now at least 33 states that have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid health care costs of smokers. The top legal officers of some of those states, along with plaintiffs lawyers handling class action cases and members of the health community began negotiating with the industry in early April.</p>
<p>Although the industry has made some concessions in the health care area, a key hurdle remains in finding a plan that would give cigarette companies some certainty about damages they would have to pay without depriving individuals of their right to sue the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Moore said he expected to hold a conference call with the other attorneys general Tuesday afternoon. He also expects to brief the White House on any progress in the talks.</p>
<p>He has been trying to reach a deal ahead of the July 7 trial date in his state's case against the industry. The Mississippi case is scheduled to be the first of the state Medicaid suits to go to trial.</p>
<p>However, both the White House and key members of Congress, who would most likely have to approve any such deal, indicated last week that they would not agree to any hastily reached accord.</p>
