<headline>NYMEX electricity called lower after Friday losses.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures were called to open lower Monday after falling Friday on technical selling and weaker spot physical power prices in the western U.S., market sources said.</p>
<p>Market sources said the front month contracts will likely test Friday's lows as daily-ahead cash values continued to fall on more generation resuming operation.</p>
<p>&quot;Daily prices are off again. We have a lot of units coming back,&quot; said a Houston futures trader.</p>
<p>In addition to a slew of fossil-fired generation returning on line late last week, the 1,112 megawatt (MW) WNP-2 nuclear power plant in Washington state was tentatively set to restart midweek pending approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).</p>
<p>July Palo Verde (PV) futures, in over-the-counter business, were quoted at $33.25-33.50 a megawatt hour (MWh) against Friday's settlement at $33.90, while July California-Oregon Border (COB) were talked at $20.50-21.00 versus Friday's close at $21.50.</p>
<p>Despite Friday's retrenchment, the July power contracts, which expire Wednesday, gained more than 20 percent last week on strong air-conditioning demand the Southwest, unplanned power plant outages and strength in the natural gas market.</p>
<p>The western U.S. would experience the start of a warming trend midweek, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Northwest would average four to eight degrees F below normal today and Tuesday before returning to seasonal levels later this week, while those in the Southwest would run up to five degrees above normal Monday and tomorrow and climb two eight degrees above normal Wednesday through Friday.</p>
<p>In other generation news, Southern California Edison pushed back the restart of the 1,080 MW San Onofre 3 nuclear unit in San Clemente, Calif., to July 10 from late June for additional work.</p>
<p>Also, the 750 MW unit 5 at the Four Corners, New Mexico, coal-fired plant may be shut most of this week after it tripped off-line last Wednesday due to a tube rupture,</p>
<p>Separately, the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) committee last week recommended a the Pacific Intertie transmission system be derated from July 1-30 to 6,300 MW from the current limit of 7,200 MW.</p>
<p>The plan requires the approval of the WSCC board.</p>
