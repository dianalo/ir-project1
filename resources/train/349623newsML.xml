<headline>CRICKET-LARA FINDS HIS FORM WITH UNBEATEN 103.</headline>
<dateline>PERTH, Australia 1997-02-02</dateline>

<p>Brian Lara finally broke through to score his first century in the series as West Indies built a formidable reply to Australia's first innings 243 in the fifth and final test on Sunday.</p>
<p>The West Indies vice-captain and number four batsman was rewarded for his patience with an unbeaten 103 that lifted his side out of trouble and into a position of strength in partnership with opener Robert Samuels.</p>
<p>At tea on the second day at the WACA Ground, West Indies were 216 for two after batting through session without losing a wicket.</p>
<p>Samuels provided a perfect foil for Lara, moving to 58 not out at the break, his highest score in the test series. Together they have added 173 runs for the third wicket, only the tourists' second century partnership in five tests.</p>
<p>Lara has suffered a dismal series with the bat, a key factor in Australia taking an unassailable 3-1 lead. The world record holder for the highest score in test cricket has appeared determined to attack the bowling whatever the circumstances in earlier tests, a tactic that failed to pay dividends.</p>
<p>In contrast, Lara played with great caution early on before gradually increasing the tempo of his innings after lunch, saving much of his aggression for left-arm wrist spinner Michael Bevan.</p>
<p>He reached his century with his 18th four in an innings lasting 196 minutes, during which he faced 158 balls.</p>
<p>Resuming on 25 without loss, West Indies lost opener Sherwin Campbell and number three Shivnarine Chanderpaul in moving to 84 for two at lunch on a hot, extremely humid day in Perth.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Curtly Ambrose underlined his importance to West Indies by claiming five for 43 on Saturday on his return from injury, while Michael Bevan and Mark Waugh both scored fine half centuries.</p>
