<p>Italian financial markets opened sharply higher on Friday ignited by optimism that a tough 1997 financial budget would lay down the strict financial discipline needed for Italy to join the European single currency.</p>
<p>In early trading, the domestic bond market reached historic highs, the lira continued to trade below 1,000 lire a mark and even the recently sluggish bourse was jolted and rose sharply.</p>
<p>Italy's centre-left government said it was ready to unveil a 1997 budget to cut some 50 trillion lire ($33 billion) off Italy's deficit, well in excess of the 32.4 trillion lire the government had originally intended to cut in its three-year economic plan.</p>
<p>The Italian cabinet meets this morning to approve the budget package which will also include a special &quot;Euro-tax&quot; which is expected to raise up to 15 trillion lire.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clearly very positive for the markets. They are reacting very well and it is quite justified,&quot; said Ken Wattret, international economist at Paribas in London.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's original plan for 32 trillion lire of deficit cuts was very positive in itself. Now it has been boosted by another half the deficit will come down quicker than we first thought,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In the bond market, BTP future contracts on London's LIFFE market swept away technical resistance levels and quickly moved into uncharted territory, as the December BTP contract hit a record high of 122.50 and at 0910 GMT traded up 195 basis points at 112.38.</p>
<p>The lira maintained its strong rise seen through Thursday and held at around steady levels at 996 lire to the mark after hitting a new high of 994.40 lire late Thursday, the highest since early August 1994</p>
<p>Shares on the Milan bourse also driven higher with the all share Mibtel index up 2.34 percent and the Mib30 index of Italy's 30 biggest companies up 2.67 percent.</p>
<p>The financial package is aimed at cutting Italy's deficit to gross domestic product ratio to three percent in 1997, a key target set out in the Maastricht Treaty for European Union members to join a single European currency.</p>
<p>But some analysts pointed out that the tough budget may dampen Italy's economic growth prospects, and may require an interest cut to stimulate the economy.</p>
