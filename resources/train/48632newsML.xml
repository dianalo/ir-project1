<p>Gillette Co and Duracell International Inc on Thursday said they plan a $7 billion merger, including a stock swap.</p>
<p>The companies said buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co, Duracell's largest shareholder, has agreed to vote in favor of the merger.  </p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Duracell shareholders would receive 0.904 share of Gillette stock for each Duracell share owned.</p>
<p>Gillette would issue about 108 million primary shares, bringing the deal's value to $7 billion, the companies said.</p>
<p>Gillette's chairman and chief executive, Alfred Zeien, said the merger was a good strategic fit that would be immediately accretive to earnings before a one-time charge.  </p>
<p>&quot;The opportunity to merge powerhouse global brands such as those of Gillette and Duracell comes very rarely.  We expect that the transaction will be immediately accretive to earnings per share, before one-time charges associated with the merger, and will accelerate the growth rate of both revenue and earnings per share of Gillette,&quot; Zeien said.</p>
<p>The merger, Zeien said, was &quot;not a diversification but an additional leg to our tightly-focused, technologically-driven, consumer products business.&quot;  </p>
<p>Charles Perrin, chairman and chief executive of Duracell, said the merger would allow the company to expand its battery business at a faster rate because Gillette already is in markets where Duracell is not as strongly represented.</p>
<p>Intended as a tax-free exchange of shares qualifying for pooling accounting treatment, the merger should be effective by year-end, the companies said.</p>
<p>The deal is still subject to the approval of shareholders of both companies.  Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts, which owns 41.1 million shares, or 34 percent, of Duracell's outstanding shares, has agreed to vote in favor of the merger.</p>
<p>The companies also said the stock repurchase programs of both Gillette and Duracell have been terminated.</p>
