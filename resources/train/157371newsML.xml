<p>Europe's toy manufacturers on Thursday welcomed a European Commission decision to challenge a Greek ban on television advertising for toys.</p>
<p>The EU executive agreed on Wednesday to send a warning letter to Greece, urging it to remove the restrictions, which non-national manufacturers say discriminate against them.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased that the Commissioners have agreed to take action to uphold the principle of a single market,&quot; said Peter Waterman, Chairman of The Toy Manufacturers of Europe Broadcasting Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that this ban was imposed for protectionist reasons and that it has damaged non-Greek toy companies,&quot; the TME, which has fought the ban for two years said.</p>
<p>Greece bans television advertising of toys to children during the hours when they are usually active, on the grounds that it is protecting their interests. The Commission gave Athens a grace period of three months to find a way of removing the ban.</p>
<p>The TME said that it was also ready to meet with the Greek authorities to find ways of reassuring it that children were not misled or exploited by television advertising.</p>
<p>&quot;Self regulation would be better than sweeping government regulation in meeting Greek concerns about advertising to children and bringing it under appropriate control,&quot; the TME said.</p>
<p>&quot;Self-regulatory systems based on detailed codes of practice covering the content of advertising to children have been successfully applied in many others parts of the European Union,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Commission was sounding the first warning shot in a three-stage EU system of infringement procedures.</p>
<p>If Athens fails to come up with changes the Commission could eventually go on to take action in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to force removal of the ban.</p>
