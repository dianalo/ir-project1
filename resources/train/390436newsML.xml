<p>Haile Gebrselassie smashed his own 5,000 metres indoors world record at an international meeting on Thursday to become the first man to complete the event in less than 13 minutes indoors.</p>
<p>The happy-go-lucky Ethiopian finished at Stockholm's Globen arena in 12 minutes 59.04 seconds, crushing his own world record by more than 11 seconds in an astonishing performance of pace and power.</p>
<p>Gebrselassie, Olympic 10,000 metre gold medallist at Atlanta, had set the previous indoor world record of 13:10.98 seconds in Germany in January last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It felt like Addis Ababa here tonight,&quot; the grinning Ethiopian told reporters after the race as a noisy contingent of compatriots in the 9,000-strong crowd went wild with delight.</p>
<p>After an average start when the pacemen set a relatively comfortable pace, Gebrselassie gradually turned on the heat and was two seconds ahead of his previous record by the 1,000 metre stage.</p>
<p>Half way through the race, he was six seconds ahead of the mark and the slight, 60 kg runner went from strength to strength, looking for all the world like a daily jogger as he nipped in and out of the crowded field on a four-lane track.</p>
<p>&quot;I had hoped to win the record but I hadn't expected to get under 13 minutes,&quot; Gebrselassie, 23, said.</p>
<p>The brilliant Ethiopian also holds the world 5,000 metres record outdoors at 12:44.39.</p>
