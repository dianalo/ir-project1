<p>Morocco's stock market resumed its upward trend on Tuesday, pushed up by a rise in demand for the largest companies, including Banque Commerciale du Maroc, stockbrokers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index rose 0.43 percent to 429.08 on the previous session.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse index surge was largely due to active trading in market blue chips...It was also influenced by the announcement of Morocco's index of 13 top shares, launched by the International Finance Corporation (IFC),&quot; said a Casablanca-based market analyst.  </p>
<p>The IFC, the private sector arm of the World bank, has also launched indices for Russia and Egypt. It gave Morocco's index a weight of 0.4 percent in its global calculation of emerging markets.</p>
<p>The Morocan stocks were ranked by market capitalisation and value traded, a broker said.</p>
<p>BCM, which has the largest capitalisation, gained 10 dirhams to close at 670 dirhams.</p>
<p>Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, a liquid stock, rose two dirhams to close at 407 dirhams.</p>
<p>Ciments de l'Oriental was traded at 365 dirhams, up five dirhams on the previous session. The firm holds about 20 percent of the domestic cement market.</p>
<p>Credit Immobilier et Hotelier, which is expected to be privatised in early 1997, rose seven dirhams to close at 188 dirhams.</p>
<p>Societe Nationale d'Investissement and ONA Group, Morocco's largest private conglomerates, remained stable at, respectively, 578 dirhams and 460 dirhams.</p>
<p>The traded volume on the official market was 13.9 million dirhams, down from 23.5 million on Monday, Upline Securities stockbroker said. ($1= 8.7 dirhams)</p>
