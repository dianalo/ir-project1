<headline>VIMRx closes Innovir deal.</headline>

<p>VIMRx Pharmaceuticals Inc said Thursday it has closed a deal acquiring a controlling interest in Innovir Laboratories Inc. As part of the deal, Innovir acquired VIMRx's subsidiary, VIMRx Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>Under the deal, VIMRx acquired 9.5 million Innovir shares owned by the Aries Funds for three million VIMRx shares and $3 million in cash.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal were modified. Originally, the transaction was to be completed entirely in stock, not to exceed $4.50 per share.  </p>
<p>VIMRx President and Chief Executive Richard Dunning said in a statement that the terms were modified because &quot;with VIMRx stock trading downward for most of the past several weeks, we felt the dilutive impact of the transaction on VIMRx shareholders would be too great so we substituted cash for part of the VIMRx stock that otherwise would have been issued.&quot;</p>
<p>VIMRx and Innovir develop complementary therapeutic technologies that seek to control disease-triggered flaws in genetic chemistry.  </p>
<p>As part of the deal, the Aries Funds, which owned four million shares of Innovir stock, exercised warrants and options to purchase an additiona six million shares. It then provided $3 million in cash to Innovir, the company said.</p>
<p>Also, VIMRx exchanged its 100 percent ownership of its subsidiary for about 8.7 million shares of Innovir stock valued at $1.50 per share, plus five-year warrants to purchase an additional two million shares of Innovir stock.</p>
<p>As a result of these transactions, VIMRx now owns about 68 percent of Innovir. In addition, Innovir has received $7 million in cash, plus commitments from VIMRx and the Aries Funds to provide an additional $2 milliion when required through the exercise of warrants.</p>
