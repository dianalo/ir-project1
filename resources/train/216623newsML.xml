<p>HM Treasury budget statement, fifth and final part</p>
<p>TOBACCO DUTIES</p>
<p>In my 1993 Budget, I gave a commitment to raise duty on tobacco by more than inflation each year.  I believe this is a fair and effective way to hammer home the message that smoking can seriously damage your health.</p>
<p>So far I am concerned, this is necessary masochism in the wider public interest. From 6 pm this evening, the tax on a packet of 20 cigarettes will increase by about 15 pence, on a packet of small cigars by about 7 pence and on a packet of pipe tobacco by about 8 pence.</p>
<p>But I am limiting the increase in the duty on hand rolling tobacco to the rate of inflation.  Hand-rolling tobacco is proving to be by far the easiest tobacco product to smuggle, although it represents a very small part of the tobacco market.</p>
<p>ALCOHOL</p>
<p>I am aware of the serious problem that cross-border shopping and smuggling of alcohol causes our drinks industry in Britain. I have already announced that Customs are stepping up their efforts further to catch smugglers.</p>
<p>Last year I was able to freeze the duty rate on beer and wine.  This year it will remain frozen.  The proportion of tax on the price of a pint in the pub is now at its lowest level for 30 years.  For some of us, that helps to keep our small cigars affordable.</p>
<p>Last year's cut in the duty on spirits was the first for 100 years.  I was tempted to maintain a striking rate of once every 100 years.  But I am sure the industry will be glad to know that they will not have to wait so long this time.</p>
<p>From 6.00pm tonight the tax on whisky, gin and other spirits will fall by another 4 per cent, worth 26 pence a bottle. The reduction in the rate on spirits boosts an important industry in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It will also reinforce last year's signal to overseas authorities not to discriminate against our products.  Only smugglers will regret that we are slowly moving our duty of spirits nearer to the continental level.</p>
<p>From 1 January, the tax on alcoholic soft drinks will be increased by over 40 per cent, by between 7 and 8 pence a bottle.  This will help meet public concern about the attraction of these &quot;alcopops&quot; for under-age drinkers, and it will also attack a distortion of competition by bringing the tax broadly into line with beer.</p>
<p>You'll notice that I have considered the balance of my overall package carefully and I have not yet been converted to a bubble-gum flavoured alcopop.  </p>
<p>BUSINESS</p>
<p>Nothing matters more for business than a stable economic environment - low interest rates and low inflation.</p>
<p>Businesses throughout Britain are benefiting from the healthy sustainable growth in the economy that I have described today. As I promised in my last Budget, from April 1997 there will be a cut in the main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions, to 10 per cent, paid for by the proceeds from the landfill tax.</p>
<p>A tax on waste to cut a tax on jobs. This will benefit employers in Britain and make it cheaper to create new jobs in our growing economy. Our overheads on jobs are already less than half those in Germany, France, or Italy.</p>
<p>I am determined to keep that advantage over our continental competitors where the creation of new jobs is over-regulated and over-priced.  This is another reason why I am confident that our unemployment will keep falling.</p>
<p>In this Budget, I propose to keep the three intermediate thresholds for employers' National Insurance Contributions where they are now.</p>
<p>I propose to increase - by 10 and 1 respectively -  the upper and lower earnings thresholds for employers' and employees National Insurance Contributions.</p>
<p>In this Budget I also want to address a particular concern of our small businesses - the burden of non-domestic rates.</p>
<p>The Uniform Business Rate is a fixed cost which can rise each year beyond the control of the manager of a small business. Since the last revaluation of business rates, I have repeatedly slowed down the increase of rates for those businesses whose rates have had to go up.</p>
<p>No business property has seen its rates go up by more than 7 1/2 per cent above inflation in any one year.  But I want to do more than this. I have decided to freeze next year's rates bill for all the small businesses whose rates would have gone up.</p>
<p>Small properties whose rates are falling will have those reductions accelerated. This will benefit over one million small business properties, by up to 130 a year. A freeze is an important step that I can make this year.  We have already reduced business rates for rural village shops.</p>
<p>But I realise that the present system of business rates bears particularly hard on the smaller business for whom they represent a much bigger proportion of total costs.  We must therefore move on as soon as possible to more changes in the system to recognise this and redistribute the burden more sensibly between smaller and larger businesses.</p>
<p>INHERITANCE TAX  </p>
<p>This Government is committed to reducing and then abolishing capital gains tax and inheritance tax.  But we have always said that we will cut these taxes only when we can afford to do so.</p>
<p>This is a responsible Budget which is protecting future growth and prosperity by putting the public finances into a healthier state.</p>
<p>We will not be able to make progress on both these taxes this year. But I am pleased to announce that we can take a further significant step towards abolishing inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is a penalty on thrift, independence and enterprise. It is a growing anachronism.</p>
<p>Lloyd George's maxim that the &quot;the most convenient time to tax the rich is when they are dead&quot; no longer holds.  It is largely paid by people of modest means who either cannot or simply do not make careful plans to avoid it.</p>
<p>Last year I made significant progress towards our commitment.  In this Budget I will build on that by raising the value of the inheritance tax threshold to 215,000. That means, that in two years the Government will have raised the threshold for inheritance tax by 40 per cent.</p>
<p>TAX REWRITE</p>
<p>In last year's Budget Speech I announced a project to rewrite Inland Revenue tax legislation in plain English.  This project is as ambitious as translating the whole of War and Peace into lucid Swahili.</p>
<p>In fact, it is more ambitious - War and Peace is only 1,500 pages long, Inland Revenue tax law is 6,000 pages.  And we did not have a Tolstoy to write our taxation laws in the first place.</p>
<p>We have consulted extensively on how the project should be carried out, and I am glad to say there is wide consensus.  The Inland Revenue will publish the plans and arrangements shortly after the Budget.</p>
<p>The aim is to prepare a series of rewrite Bills, the first of them to be ready for enactment in the 1997-98 session.  My noble and learned friend Lord Howe has produced a thorough and helpful report on how Parliament might handle these bills.</p>
