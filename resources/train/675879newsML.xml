<headline>Lima stocks edge up in quiet, cautious market.</headline>
<dateline>LIMA 1997-06-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Lima Stock Exchange made small gains overall Friday in a quiet market marked by investor caution, which is expected to continue next week.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were waiting for the next batch of monthly macroeconomic indicators, and were also edgy about the possible negative impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon.</p>
<p>&quot;The (economic) news has yet to come out out at the end of the month, and then we will see how the companies are progressing,&quot; said Julio Alcalde of MGS and Asociados brokerage.  </p>
<p>He added that the El Nio phenomenon, expected towards the end of 1997, could hurt companies in the electricity, fishing, agriculture and mining sectors.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures, the bolsa's General Index .IGRA rose 0.16 percent Friday to 2,170.16 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index .ISEL was up 0.19 percent to 3,120.09.</p>
<p>Analysts said Peru's political problems, which had hurt the market in recent days, were not an important factor in Friday's trade.  </p>
<p>Overall, 37 stocks rose, 37 were flat and 29 fell.</p>
<p>Brewery group Unin de Cerveceras Backus -- boosted by the long hot weather spell -- gained 1.85 percent to 2.75 soles, while cement company Cementos Lima rose 0.96 percent to 5.25 soles, and miner Morococha ended up 0.82 percent to 6.15 soles.</p>
<p>Benchmark Telefnica del Per was stable at 6.90 soles.</p>
