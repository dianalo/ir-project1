<headline>Budapest bourse posts mild gains, BUX futures ease.</headline>

<p>The Budapest bourse's index edged a few points higher on Thursday as the dollar's strength and buoyancy on foreign markets gave only a little help, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong dollar and the rising trend in Europe had no impact on the Hungarian market,&quot; said Laszlo Baranyai of Gog Securities.</p>
<p>The BUX index closed at 5,459.38 points, up 7.50. Spot share turnover totalled 1.40 billion forints, the second lowest this year.</p>
<p>BUX futures ended lower for all maturities, dropping by between 13.50 and 70.00 points. March BUX futures remained below the spot index and ended at 5,432 points, down 13.50.</p>
<p>Traders said investors of the Hungarian bourse were in a wait-and-see attitude, either sitting on the shares they had bought earlier this year, or looking forward to new share issues, like that in oil company MOL or pharmaceuticals company Richter.</p>
<p>The compensation coupons which rose to a 52-week high of 931 forints earlier this week were in focus and continued to tumble as a result of a lack of any near-term opportunities to use the papers. The coupons closed at 685 forints, down 130.</p>
<p>&quot;Subscriptions in (electricity supplier) Elmu Rt are over, so we are again where we were recently, namely that investors don't have any opportunities to use their coupons, at least for the time being,&quot; one trader said earlier today.</p>
<p>Compensation coupons were awarded to victims of expropriation under Hungary's former fascist and communist regimes. The coupons can be used as payment in the country's privatisation process.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the market, brewery stocks ended lower with the exception of brewery Soproni which remained steady at 5,600 forints.</p>
<p>The chemicals, Borsodchem and TVK posted mild gains of 80 forints and 25 forints to close at 6m510 and 2,250, respectively.</p>
<p>Retailer Fotex firmed four forints to end at 160.</p>
