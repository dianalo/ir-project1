<title>KENYA: Kenya shilling bullish vs dlr on foreign demand.</title>
<headline>Kenya shilling bullish vs dlr on foreign demand.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1996-12-17</dateline>

<p>After a week of low trading within the narrow band of 55.25/30 levels, the Kenyan shilling was firm against the dollar on Tuesday, breaking the 55.20 barrier as large inflows from foreign investors streamed into the market, commercial bank dealers said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Kenya posted a mean shilling average of 55.16 against the dollar from 55.27, while on the pound it was posted at 91.87 from 91.79.</p>
<p>&quot;The shilling's appreciation was facilitated by large dollar inflows from foreign investors, who entered the treasury bill market on Friday last week,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Modest inflows from the horticultural sector amid dwindling importer demand contributed further to the shilling's strength,&quot; another dealer added.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the shilling's bullish trend to continue throughout the week, as the oil sector which accounted for most of the demand seen in the last week, appeared to have fulfilled most of its dollar obligations.</p>
<p>The money market was still a bit tight with most banks seeking for funds. Some dealers said there were mixed signs in the market which left it unsure of liquidity levels.</p>
<p>Overnight rates were quoted between 14 and 23 percent from Mondays 20 percent levels.</p>
