<p>Iran's supreme leader, ignoring President Bill Clinton's assertion that he has not yet concluded who was responsible for a bomb that killed Americans in Saudi Arabia, says the United States is preparing an attack on Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;The American administration...has decided to strike. They did not say so but evidence indicates this,&quot; spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Revolutionary Guards at the weekend.</p>
<p>Khamenei, the Islamic republic's supreme authority and commander-in-chief of its armed forces, said U.S. media allegations over Tehran's alleged involvement in the bomb which killed 19 American airmen at a Saudi base in June were aimed at justifying military action against Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans accuse Iran of being a threat to the region, of having nuclear ambitions and supporting terrorism. U.S. media have raised the possibility of an Iranian involvement in the Saudi June bombing,&quot; he said in the speech broadcast live on Tehran radio on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia had given the United States detailed data to support the Saudis' belief that the bombing was carried out by Shi'ites trained in Lebanon and backed by Iran.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Los Angeles Times reported that Washington was making contingency plans for possible punitive action, including military strikes, against Iran if it was proven to be behind the bomb attack.</p>
<p>Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on Thursday dismissed the U.S. news reports as &quot;a baseless allegation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We deny any involvement, directly or indirectly. We are against any kind of terrorist actions against any country,&quot; he told reporters at the end of an Islamic conference in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Iran believed the bombings in Saudi Arabia were an internal problem of the kingdom, Velayati said.</p>
<p>Diplomats told Reuters in the Gulf on Thursday that the Saudi investigation pointed towards links to Iran although there was no proof of direct involvement in the bombing.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has remained silent on the investigation.</p>
<p>Clinton said at a White House news conference on Friday the investigation was not complete and he had not reached a conclusion on responsibility.</p>
<p>Khamenei also told the Revolutionary Guards any attempt on the Islamic republic's security could put the entire oil region, which has about half the world's proven oil reserves, at risk.</p>
<p>&quot;Any aggression or attempts to make Islamic Iran insecure will make the Persian Gulf more insecure for the enemies of the Iranian nation, particularly those living in glass houses,&quot; he said.</p>
