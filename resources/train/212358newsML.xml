<p>Authorities in China's southwestern Guizhou province have executed eight prisoners convicted of taking part in a violent jailbreak, the Guizhou Daily said.</p>
<p>The eight were shot after a mass sentencing in a prison in the provincial capital of Guiyang on November 18, the newspaper said in an edition seen in Beijing on Saturday.</p>
<p>They had been convicted of taking part in an attempt to escape from prison in which several guards and inmates were killed and injured, it said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Court officials also cut the sentences of seven inmates who performed meritous deeds during the attempted jailbreak, the newspaper said but did not elaborate.</p>
