<p>Japanese patrol ships on Monday repulsed a flotilla of Taiwan and Hong Kong activists trying to defy Tokyo's claim of sovereignty by landing on a disputed East China Sea archipelago.</p>
<p>Seventeen Japanese vessels backed by a helicopter thwarted eight landing attempts by placing themselves between the seven fishing boats and the uninhabited islands, claimed by Japan as the Senkakus but known to Chinese as the Diaoyus.</p>
<p>&quot;Down with Japanese imperialism!&quot; activists shouted as Taipei county assemblyman and flotilla organiser Chin Chieh-shou chanted &quot;Charge! Charge! Charge!&quot; from the Changchun's bow.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese dogs out of Chinese territory!&quot; some of the 20 protesters cried. &quot;This is Chinese territory and these are Chinese waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Several Taiwan boats reached within 200 metres (yards) of one island where a Japanese flag could be seen fluttering above some abandoned buildings and a tower. All were repulsed.</p>
<p>A lighthouse built in July by Japanese ultra-nationalists and the Japanese coast guard's September 5 expulsion of a Taiwan fishing boat have re-ignited a long-dormant dispute over the islands, claimed by Beijing and Taipei as well as Tokyo.</p>
<p>The activists had vowed to remove the lighthouse and flag.</p>
<p>The patrol boat crewmen, speaking only Japanese, ordered the activists to leave what they called Japan's territory, unlike the earlier confrontation when they spoke Chinese and flew a Chinese banner proclaiming Japanese sovereignty.</p>
<p>No shots were fired and there was no physical contact, although there were several brushes within 10 metres (yards).</p>
<p>The Japanese made no attempt to board the Taiwan vessels.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese pilots finally aborted the protest mission, saying rising seas made further landing attempts dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;We will go back again with more people and more boats,&quot; Chin said en route back to Keelung harbour. &quot;We are confident that next time we will succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan's coast guard confirmed repulsing seven vessels, some flying Taiwan flags, but gave no details.</p>
<p>&quot;As a matter of routine we warned them to move out,&quot; a coast guard spokesman said by telephone from Japan's southernmost island of Okinawa, which has jurisdiction over the islands.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no trouble or direct clash,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Taiwan group had hoped to plant the flag of the island's exiled Republic of China while the Hong Kong protesters carried the flag of its communist rival, the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chinese anger has swelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and China itself over Tokyo's tolerance of the rightists' actions and its view that its claim was not open to discussion.</p>
<p>Protests have become a near-daily occurrence.</p>
<p>On Sunday, thousands of anti-Japanese demonstrators marched through Taipei streets and some of them took turns flogging an effigy of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
<p>Taiwan pledged on Saturday to defend the Diaoyus by force if necessary, but only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Tokyo's claim dates to 1895, when Japan defeated China and seized Taiwan and other territories. Beijing and Taipei say Chinese claims go back centuries but both have resisted calls to expel Japan by force.</p>
<p>Taiwan and China have been bitter rivals since a civil war split them in 1949 and the Republic of China government, defeated by the communists, took refuge on Taiwan.</p>
