<title>USA: CSCE to lower margins on July &quot;C&quot; coffee futures.</title>
<headline>CSCE to lower margins on July &quot;C&quot; coffee futures.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange said Monday it will lower the margin on the July &quot;C&quot; coffee contract to $9,000, including a $3,000 spot charge, effective June 24.</p>
<p>The current margin required for the July 1997 contract is $10,000, including a $4,000 spot charge.</p>
<p>The margin on all other coffee contracts will remain unchanged, the exchange said in a statement.</p>
<p>The change comes less than a week after the exchange lowered the July margin by $2,000, to $10,000. At that time, the September &quot;C&quot; coffee margin was decreased to $8,000, including a $2,000 spot charge and the margins on all other contracts were lowered to $6,000.</p>
<p>In addition, straddle or arbitrage transactions for customers who are CSCE members or members of the trade will require a minimum of $1,000, down from $1,500. However, the $3,000 spot charge for July 1997 is applicable to all straddle and arbitrage transactions involving this contract month.</p>
<p>For customers who are not exchange members or a member of the trade, margins will be 140 percent above trade rates, CSCE said. ((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodities Desk, 212 859 1640))</p>
