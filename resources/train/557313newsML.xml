<p>The Labour Party's thumping victory in the British election should buoy sterling, but gains will be cautious until the new government shows its true economic colours, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would err on the side of a positive interpretation, at least until we've seen a bit more about what their policies will be,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
<p>The pound see-sawed as results emerged of an election which ended 18 unbroken years of Conservative rule.</p>
<p>It spiked up initially as market fears faded of a hung parliament -- where no party has a clear majority -- but later retreated as players took fright at the thought of an untried administration possessing such a concentration of power.</p>
<p>&quot;A very strong majority gives them the upper hand to do whatever they want,&quot; said Peter Osler, head of research at GNI.</p>
<p>Bargain hunters later stepped in, however, pushing the pound back up again.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not 100 percent convinced it actually changes very much,&quot; said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Sterling will glean support from the perception that Britain's new rulers will be more prepared to make the interest rate hike the Bank of England has long been urging. But tightening is already largely priced in, Barr said.</p>
<p>Labour finance spokesman Gordon Brown moved fast to soothe concerns he could prove economically lax as poll results set him on course to become Britain's next Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>&quot;We fully intend to keep all our promises and will move very quickly on a budget,&quot; Brown told ITN television news.</p>
<p>He said a Labour government would deliver the first budget within two months and would set monetary policy to meet an inflation target of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Most will want to see evidence that all the pre-election rhetoric and promises will be put into practice,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the markets have given (Labour leader Tony) Blair the benefit of the doubt, but rates must be hiked and the fiscal position tightened enough to give credibility to the new government's economic policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Blair took over as leader in 1994 and -- eager to kill off the party's high-tax, high-spending image -- shunted it steadily rightwards under the tag of &quot;new Labour&quot;.</p>
<p>With that in mind, markets should welcome the huge majority since it plants Blair firmly in control of all wings of his party, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market will view it in a positive light because it means the hard left -- still part of the Labour Party -- will not be able to set the agenda,&quot; said CIBC's Coleman.</p>
<p>Sterling stood at 2.7970/80 marks and $1.6220/25 at 0525 GMT compared with 2.7970/80 and $1.6253/60 before exit polls and early results appeared.</p>
<p>It was off overnight highs of 2.8035 and $1.6280.</p>
