<title>PHILIPPINES: Thousands of Philippine rebels receive amnesty.</title>

<p>The Philippines on Wednesday granted amnesty to more than 3,000 mostly left-wing rebels and said it was keeping the door open for other insurgents to surrender.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me assure you that the government will do its part and prove itself worthy of your faith,&quot; President Fidel Ramos told the former rebels at a formal ceremony where they received their amnesty certificates.</p>
<p>The government is to set up a jobs programme and give each former rebel an amnesty loan of 8,000 pesos ($300).</p>
<p>Ramos said more than 7,000 people had applied for amnesty since he launched his reconciliation programme in 1992. Some of the applications had been rejected while others were still being processed, he said.</p>
<p>Most of those accepting the amnesty offer were left-wing rebels, but they also include Moslem insurgents and military mutineers.</p>
<p>One of those previously given amnesty, former communist New People's Army (NPA) chief Romulo Kintanar, on Tuesday took his oath before Congress Speaker Jose de Venecia as a new member of Ramos's Lakas (People's Power) party.</p>
<p>&quot;There is practically no more ground to fight the government,&quot; a press release from de Venecia's office quoted Kintanar as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;With the state pursuing land reform, we are convinced that it is dedicated to the improvement of the lives of the people.&quot;</p>
<p>The military says NPA strength has fallen to about 5,000 from a peak of more than 26,000 in the late l980s due to the collapse of communism in Europe, battlefield losses and widespread surrender.</p>
