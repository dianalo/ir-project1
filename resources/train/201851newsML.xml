<p>Andre Agassi faced a cacophony of boos, whistles and jeers after a dismal performance against world number one Pete Sampras in his opening match at the ATP world tennis championship on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Agassi, who said he had been ill in the last few days and might still pull out of the tournament, was a long way from his best and was swept off court in just 48 minutes by Sampras who won the round-robin red group clash 6-2 6-1.</p>
<p>The 12,000-strong crowd, who paid between 180 and 230 marks ($120 and $153) to watch Wednesday's three matches at the prestigious season-ending championship, cheered the Las Vegas player at the start of the match.</p>
<p>By the end they were booing and whistling loudly at being deprived of entertainment from a match which, on paper, was a classic showdown between two grand slam champions.</p>
<p>Agassi, who was also destroyed by Sampras at last month's Stuttgart Open, put his poor form down to a stomach upset and influenza.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt pretty weak. I was not fit to play well,&quot; the world number seven said. &quot;It was not enjoyable going out like that. I thought about withdrawing before the tournament started. I felt pretty close. It is possible that I might (still) pull out.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the reaction of the crowd, the 26-year-old Las Vegas player added: &quot;I hardly blame them. I wasn't playing well. I felt worse than they did.&quot;</p>
<p>Agassi played erratic tennis from the start. He was in trouble on his own serve as early as the fourth game when he had to save several break points. Sampras, who served and volleyed well, eventually broke in the sixth game and went on to take the set in 29 minutes.</p>
<p>After that Agassi's game fell apart and the match was no longer a contest.</p>
<p>The crowd started expressing their anger after Agassi double-faulted to give Sampras a 4-0 lead in the second set.</p>
<p>Asked about the crowd, Sampras said: &quot;People spent their own money and they were hoping for a three-set match. They were obviously not happy. On the other hand I played great tennis.</p>
<p>&quot;People came to see a match decided 7-6 in the third set and they didn't get that... Everything clicked for me. I was in a zone. He did not play quite as well.&quot;</p>
<p>The championship, which brings together the top eight players in the world, is played in a round-robin format in the early stages. The top two players from each of the two groups advance to the semifinals.</p>
<p>Agassi still has two tough group matches ahead against Australian Open champion Boris Becker and Russia's French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov.</p>
<p>Earlier Michael Chang's hopes of reaching the decisive stages suffered a setback when he lost to Thomas Muster, his second defeat in the white group.</p>
<p>The American world number two, who lost his opening match to Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek in straight sets on Tuesday, went down 6-4 6-3 after a baseline battle.</p>
<p>Chang reached the final of the season-ending championship last year but before that had a largely poor record at the event. The American now looks unlikely to go any further in the competition.</p>
