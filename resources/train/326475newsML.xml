<text>
<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in lacklustre trade with most traders sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. December housing starts data, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Housing starts for December is forecast to be around 1.470 million annualised units compared with 1.514 million units reported in November.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet and featureless in the morning due mainly to an absence of fresh incentives. Some people are waiting for fresh clues from tonight's release of the (U.S. December) housing starts figures,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think there will be much impact here, unless the numbers are way off market expectations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Wednesday/Thursday, Thursday/Friday and week-fixed were unchanged from Tuesday's common 5-3/8 5-1/4 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, one-month was unchanged at 5-7/16 5-5/16 percent, three-months unchanged at 5-9/16 5-7/16, nine-months unchanged at 5-13/16 5-11/16 and twelve-months unchanged at 5-15/16 5-13/16 percent.</p>
