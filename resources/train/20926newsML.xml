<p>Ian Woosnam and Sandy Lyle were unhappy men on Thursday after being forced to rise before dawn to resume their opening rounds at the sodden British Masters at Collingtree Park.</p>
<p>After play was called off on Wednesday following two thunderstorms, Woosnam found himself required to return early to complete three unfinished holes and despite a round of 70 was uncomplimentary about the tournament director's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we could have played for another hour yesterday evening. It was throwing it down with more rain in the middle of the night and the course was in no better condition this morning. In fact, it was twice as difficult because there was a wind.&quot;</p>
<p>Woosnam's playing partner Lyle did not even bother to finish his round, deciding to quit when he went into the water at the last.</p>
<p>The former Open and US Masters champion bogeyed the 16th and double-bogeyed the 17th to be four over and told his caddie on the last fairway: &quot;If I birdie this hole we'll stay, but if I go into the lake we won't.&quot;</p>
<p>The latter happened with his pitch and Lyle said afterwards: &quot;I shouldn't be here. My wife's in hospital for a hysterectomy.&quot;</p>
<p>Lyle has been having a rough time of things lately. Both his parents have died this year and his wife Yolande lost her father recently.</p>
<p>With a forecast of more rain it was also doubtful whether the second round would be completed on schedule.</p>
