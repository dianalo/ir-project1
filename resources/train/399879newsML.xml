<p>European shares opened mixed on Monday as Friday's uninspiring close on Wall Street weighed on sentiment and dealers said currency markets were also quiet, lacking incentive before key data this week.</p>
<p>London shares were down about a quarter of a percentage point in early trade, influenced by a batch of heavyweight stocks going ex-dividend and with sentiment nervous after Friday's New York trading, which ended with the Dow just a few points up.</p>
<p>Dealers said the fact that Barclays and Lloyds TSB were both trading ex their declared dividends was pulling the market lower.</p>
<p>Investors were also concerned  that the strength of sterling -- at its highest level since it left the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992 -- would affect earnings as the corporate results season gets fully under way.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares were also slightly lower in early trading with sentiment there weighed on by the softening of the dollar -- which is negative for German exports.</p>
<p>In Paris, however,  French shares found some buying support and showed narrow gains in early trading.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was supported by buying on the first account day although it was trading under the sway of softer domestic and German bonds, the retracement of the dollar and New York's mixed close last Friday.</p>
<p>Both equities and currency markets were treading water to an extent ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's semi-annual commentary on the U.S. economy to Senate and House committees on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>His utterances will, as usual, be scrutinized for clues to future U.S. credit policy.</p>
<p>On currency markets, traders said the dollar was softening marginally against the mark and yen and by mid-morning it was at session lows of around 122 yen and just off its lows of around 1.6750 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll probably see some range trading today. With such important things coming up this week, people don't want to start taking very aggressive positions,&quot; said Thomas Rayner, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.</p>
<p>Economic data showing signs of some health in the German economy last week was also making the market wary of being too long on the dollar and giving it a softer tone, analysts said.</p>
<p>Also weighing on the dollar was a Washington Post article on Sunday which quoted sources as saying some senior U.S. officials expressed concerns about the U.S. stock market, saying &quot;the higher the market goes, the closer it could be to a correction&quot;.</p>
<p>Analysts said this report was causing worries particularly ahead of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey Hawkins testimony.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1030 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6750 marks and 122.00 yen compared to the 1.6883 and 123.20 in late European trade on Friday.</p>
