<p>At least eight people were killed and dozens wounded, including two leaders of a militant Sunni Moslem group, when a bomb exploded outside a court in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>Other sources put the toll as high as 13 dead and 55 wounded, but officials could not confirm the figures.</p>
<p>Police said a bomb, apparently planted on a motorcycle, exploded at about 12.30 p.m. (0730 GMT) as Zia-ur-Rahman Faruqi, leader of the Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) group, and his deputy Azam Tariq, arrived at the court.</p>
<p>Witnesses said most of the casualties were policemen, journalists, lawyers, or SSP supporters who had gathered to throw flowers at their leaders, who were due to appear before the Sessions Court in the city centre.</p>
<p>The two men face charges of involvement in sectarian killings of Shi'ite Moslems, who form about 15 percent of Pakistan's predominantly Sunni population of over 130 million.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how badly the two leaders had been hurt.</p>
<p>The bomb blast appeared to be the latest attack in a long-running feud between militant Sunnis and Shi'ites that cost more than 40 lives last year in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The secretary of Iran's National Security Council, Hassan Rowhani, urged the Pakistani government on Thursday to mount a &quot;crackdown on terrorist groups in Pakistan and (prevent) the assassination of Shi'ite Moslems&quot;.</p>
<p>The Iranian news agency IRNA said Rowhani, a Shi'ite cleric, made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahibzada Yaqoob Khan.</p>
<p>&quot;The groups not only endanger Pakistan's security, but also hamper the unity of Moslems,&quot; Rowhani said.</p>
<p>Shi'ite militancy in Pakistan was fuelled by the 1979 Islamic revolution in Shi'ite-majority Iran, sparking a fierce backlash from well-armed Sunni groups such as the SSP.</p>
<p>Two Shi'ite leaders were killed in separate incidents in Pakistan on December 31 and a Shi'ite activist was shot dead on Monday.</p>
