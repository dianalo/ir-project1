<headline>Australia stocks surge to record close on wage data.</headline>

<p>The Australian stock market closed at a record closing high on Thursday, its third record close in less than two weeks, after weak wages data heightened speculation that interest rates would be cut soon.</p>
<p>The key market barometer, the All Ordinaries index, closed 30.9 points or 1.3 percent higher at 2,377.6, just 3.2 points below its all-time high of 2,380.8 set intra-day on October 15.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened full of fight this morning and then got steamed up by the weaker than expected average weekly earnings figures,&quot; said Eric Gale, director of institutions at Sydney brokerage Ord Minnett.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.7 percent in the three months to August, taking annual growth to 3.5 percent from 3.9 percent in the previous three-month period.</p>
<p>That was a two-year low for wages growth and comfortably below median forecasts of 1.0 and 3.7 percent growth respectively.</p>
<p>The wages data followed consumer price data on Wednesday which showed inflation in Australia also slumped to a two-year low in the third quarter, to an annual rate of 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been running along with a rate cut in mind so the wages data, which could have spooked the market, was a considerable relief,&quot; Gale said.</p>
<p>The key beneficiaries of the data were rate-sensitive issues such as banks, transport and media stocks.</p>
<p>News Corp was an outstanding performer on the day.</p>
<p>Dealers said Rupert Murdoch's company was continuing a recovery started in New York on Wednesday after being sold down earlier in the week on a broker's sell recommendation.</p>
<p>The stock closed 24 cents higher at A$7.28 ($US5.75). The company announced after the market closed plans to raise US$1 billion  through an issue of preference shares.</p>
<p>Although cyclical issues were the stars, dealers said it was the resources sector that set the stage for the market's rise and were the platform for further gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Resources have been consistently stronger over the last week because the market has realised they had been oversold on fears that base metal prices could have fallen a lot more than they actually have,&quot; said a dealer a Brisbane brokerage.</p>
<p>Key resource issues BHP, WMC and CRA opened firmer, propping the market up early in defiance of another drop on Wall Street.</p>
<p>It was a rare show of independence from Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;It indicates a belief that the Australian market is still undervalued compared to the U.S. market,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>The market was spurred on by a big fall in bond yields after the release of the wages data.</p>
<p>The yield on the Australian government's 10-year bond dropped to 7.39 percent, the lowest since March 1994 and down 0.15 percentage points from Wednesday's close.</p>
