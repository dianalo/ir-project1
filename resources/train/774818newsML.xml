<p>Nigerian defender Michael Emenalo also scored for the Clash (8-15), which won for the third time in eight matches for new coach Brian Quinn.</p>
<p>Imad Baba had given New England (12-10) an early 1-0 lead, but the Revolution suffered their third consecutive defeat.</p>
<p>At New Jersey, goalkeeper Mark Dougherty saved a penalty kick by Colombian international Antony De Avila with seven minutes remaining in regulation to preserve the Tampa Bay Mutiny's 3-2 win over the New York/New Jersey MetroStars (7-13).</p>
<p>Brazilian Gilmar scored twice and set up Roy Lassiter's goal for the Mutiny (13-10). De Avila had both of the MetroStars' goals.</p>

<p>Preki also set up Mark Chung's goal for Kansas City, which retained first place in the Western Conference and have the best record in the league.</p>
<p>Gerell Elliott tallied for Dallas, which played the final 10 minutes of the match a man down after Mexican star Damian Alvarez was red-carded for elbowing a Kansas City player while both lined up for a free kick.</p>
<p>In Pasadena, Bill Thompson, who entered the game in the 87th minute, scored as time was running out and boosted the Columbus Crew (9-13) to a 2-1 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy (9-12) to halt a five-game losing streak.</p>

<p>Marcelo Balboa converted the game-winner as goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann made three saves in the shootout, including on Tony Sanneh's attempt on the fifth and final round, as Colorado defeated United for the first time in six meetings.</p>
<p>Chris Henderson and Mexican David Patino scored for the Rapids in regulation while El Salvadoran Raul Diaz Arce and former U.S. international Roy Wegerle found the back of the net for United, which is in first place in the East.</p>
