<p>Jagmohan Dalmiya, who takes over in June as president of the International Cricket Council (ICC), plans to use his term of office to spread a game which is currently confined to a handful of nations.</p>
<p>&quot;The ICC was established in 1907 and 90 years later we just have nine test-playing nations,&quot; said Dalmiya whose appointment, which lasts until June 2000, was announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Cricket needs to break free of the shackles if it is to spread its wings.&quot;</p>
<p>At a special general meeting at Kuala Lumpur on Sunday, the ICC chose India at the head of a new governing structure, in which a president will replace the current head, chairman Sir Clyde Walcott of the West Indies.</p>
<p>Dalmiya, a 55-year-old construction magnate from Calcutta, can rely on his shrewd business skills to do it, especially after he managed a $100 million financial bonanza out of the World Cup staged in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan last year.</p>
<p>His eyes are firmly set on marrying the easily accessible one-day version of the game with sponsor money linked to television broadcasts in emerging markets of the world, and launch a worldwide marketing campaign to boost the idea.</p>
<p>He also plans to spice up the five-day test matches although he has previously upset traditionalists with his proposal to impose a time or over limit on the length of an innings.</p>
<p>Dalmiya had to cut short his own ambitions to play cricket at the age of 18 when he took over a family business on his father's death.</p>
<p>&quot;One day it dawned on me that if I couldn't excel as a player, I could serve the game as an official. That was the beginning of my second innings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dalmiya rose steadily in Calcutta's cricketing circles before becoming a leader in the nation's cricket administration.</p>
<p>He has served on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), latterly as secretary, since 1984 and he has played a vital role in effective marketing of the game.</p>
<p>He was instrumental in increasing the number of competing nations in the last World Cup from nine to 12 and is eager to see that number doubled in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>As secretary of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Dalmiya has persuaded the continent's three major cricketing nations -- India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- to help popularise the game in the south-east and eastern regions of the continent.</p>
<p>Considered a diplomat by many, Dalmiya will need all his skills if he is to lead cricket into the next millenium.</p>
