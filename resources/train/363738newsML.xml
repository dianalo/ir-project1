<title>USA: Dow Jones family member resigns post.</title>
<headline>Dow Jones family member resigns post.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>William Cox III, a member of the family that controls Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., has resigned from his job at the media company, a Dow Jones spokesman said Friday.</p>
<p>Most recently, Cox was managing Dow Jones' global stock indexes, spokesman Sanford Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Dow Jones, which supplies business news and information and publishes the Wall Street Journal, received a letter from Cox saying he was leaving the company, where he had worked for 18 years, Jacobs said.</p>
<p>Jacobs said he could not divulge reasons given by Cox for his departure, nor say when the resignation is effective.</p>
<p>Cox and a cousin, Elisabeth Goth, have made headlines in recent weeks over their stated disappointment with the New York-based company's direction and the value of its stock.</p>
<p>Dow Jones' stock took a hit in late January after the company reported it would spend $650 million to expand and revitalise its Telerate financial information services unit. On the day of that announcement, the company's stock fell $4.50 to $36.375.</p>
<p>Dow Jones rose 37.5 cents to $39.625 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p>
<p>Cox, whose father William Cox Jr. is on the board of directors, did not immediately return two telephone calls seeking comment. His lawyer, Ira Millstein, also has not returned several telephone calls over the past week.</p>
<p>Other family members, including Cox's father, have said they support Dow Jones management.</p>
<p>Cox told the New York Post in Friday's editions that he was leaving the company so he could pursue his effort to change Dow Jones &quot;independently.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It makes more sense to go this route,&quot; Cox was quoted as saying.</p>
