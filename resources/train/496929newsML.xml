<p>U.S. fund manager David Herro, whose Oakmark International fund has taken a more than three percent stake in Sedgwick Group Plc, on Wednesday said the investment in the London-based insurance broker was passive.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a long-term passive investment -- that would be the best way to describe it,&quot; Herro said in a telephone interview. &quot;We don't intend to try to accomplish anything other than to ride along.&quot;  </p>
<p>Chicago-based Herro is reported to have been instrumental two years ago in the ouster of Maurice Saatchi as chairman of the advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Plc, which was later renamed Cordiant Plc. He is a portfolio manager for the Oakmark International and Oakmark Small Cap International funds.</p>
<p>Herro said published reports suggesting he may be plotting a shake-up of Sedgwick were &quot;extremely incorrect&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been buying the stock all along,&quot; Herro said. &quot;We've just crossed the three percent barrier.&quot;  </p>
<p>Consolidation in the insurance broking industry pushed Sedgwick stock higher, Herro said, but when the company did not take part in the mergers and takeovers, its share price fell.</p>
<p>&quot;We were tiny holders before that, and after nothing happened with Sedgwick, the share price came tumbling down,&quot; Herro said.</p>
<p>&quot;We just used that as an opportunity to increase our position,&quot; he said, adding that the recent concentration in insurance broking has removed competitors and generally improved the industry, which should be &quot;a mild positive&quot; for Sedgwick.</p>
<p>Sedgwick stock closed in London on Wednesday at 126 pence, compared with a 52-week high of 145 pence.</p>
<p>Herro said he does not plan to attend Sedgwick's annual general meeting on April 24.</p>
