<title>SPAIN: Repsol at fresh high on bright outlook.</title>
<headline>Repsol at fresh high on bright outlook.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-04-10</dateline>

<p>Shares in Spain's Repsol continued to hit new highs on Thursday after the firm gave a glowing account of its prospects at a presentation to financial analysts on Wednesday, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>The government is selling its last 10.0 percent stake in the firm this month to leave the energy group fully privatised.</p>
<p>At 1055 GMT Repsol was up 50 pesetas to 6,200 while the Ibex-35 index of leading shares fell 0.42 percent to 5,503.99.</p>
<p>Juan Cueto, analyst at Ibersecurities brokerage said earnings forecasts given by chairman Alfonso Cortina at the first of a series of roadshows had bolstered the shares.</p>
<p>&quot;To say that net and operating profit are going to double in the next five year means 15 percent growth every year and that the shares are cheap,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cortina's statement reinforced optimistic expectations on the success of the firm's last share offer, and press reports indicate that on the retail tranche bids are far outpacing the offer.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been clear from the start that there would be no problems placing the shares,&quot; said a dealer at a bank which is participating in the management of the offer.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the outcome of the Repsol offer would be key in the government's decision on how much of its 67 percent stake in electricity firm Empresa Nacional de Electricidad it will bring to the market this year.</p>
<p>The government may now sell 40 percent of Endesa this year, up from around 20 percent as originally planned.</p>
<p>&quot;The better the result of the investment in (recently-privatised) Telefonica and Repsol, the better the position of Endesa, where the volume of shares to be sold will be substantially more,&quot; said an analyst at an independent brokerage.</p>
