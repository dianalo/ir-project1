<p>Farm ministers are expected to reject next week a proposal to ban tissue from sheep and goats, as well as cattle, most likely to be infected with scrapie or mad cow disease, EU diplomats and officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Ministers will also receive a progress report from British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg on the fight against mad cow disease, known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>Under the so-called comitology procedure, the December 19-20 Farm Council can reject the Commission's proposal by a simple majority of eight member states.</p>
<p>&quot;That looks likely,&quot; a diplomat said.</p>
<p>Last week, 12 members of the EU's Standing Veterinary Committee voted against the proposal, saying the measures were excessive as their countries were virtually free of scrapie and mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Britain and France voted in favour while Ireland abstained.</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed that the brains, eyes, spinal cord and spleen should be removed from sheep, goats and cattle over 12 months old and kept out of human and animal food.</p>
<p>Since then only Portugal has shifted its stance, saying it will now abstain, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said it was unclear if the BSE report, due on Tuesday, would mention implementation of a selective cull of younger cattle most at risk to BSE.</p>
<p>The cull, which would involve up to 147,000 cattle, was part of an agreement at the European Council in Florence in June for a gradual lifting of a global ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>Sources said there was speculation an announcement could be made either at the European Council in Dublin, which ends on Saturday, or in the British parliament on Monday.</p>
<p>Regarding the sheep tissue ban, Germany, supported by Denmark and several other countries, argues that the measures should apply only to the worst affected countries -- Britain, France and Ireland.</p>
<p>Germany suggested the proposal could be reviewed in February after EU inspectors have reported on the situation.</p>
<p>Another group, led by the Netherlands, wants different measures to apply for human and animal food as well as to high and low risk countries.</p>
<p>The Commission, which insists that protection of human health and the restoration of consumer confidence in beef and sheepmeat must be given priority, has refused to make concessions.</p>
<p>It says that no member states are totally risk free and national exemptions would distort meat trade in the EU single market.</p>
<p>But special treatment may be granted non-EU countries, such as the United States, Canada and Australia, provided they can satisfy the Commission about the safety of their meat.</p>
<p>The Commission, which has been criticised for acting too slowly and cautiously, insists that member states must play their part in fighting the diseases.</p>
<p>On the selective cull, the Farm Council would not need to take any action even if Britain announced it was going ahead with it, EU officials said.</p>
<p>The next step would be for Britain to submit a working paper to the Commission on how it would implement the cull. It is expected to suggest a regional approach, starting with Northern Ireland, and that the ban be eased on the same basis.</p>
<p>The Commission would take a decision after receiving advice from the EU Scientific Veterinary, Multidisciplinary and Standing Veterinary Committees.</p>
<p>&quot;That could take quite a long time,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>BSE is believed to have arisen from sheep scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease, which can be passed from one animal to another and from ewe to lamb but not to humans.</p>
<p>But recent British and French research has shown that sheep could catch BSE which can be transmitted to humans. Sheep have also been fed on meat and bone meal, which is believed to be a prime cause of BSE. 13 13</p>
