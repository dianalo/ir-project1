<p>CBOT March corn futures surged higher in fast dealings as Rosenthal Collins bought at least three million bushels and stops were hit at $2.70 per bushel, traders said.  </p>
<p>Traders noted funds were short corn going into Friday's USDA report and were covering positions.</p>
<p>R.J. O'Brien bought eight million bushels March on the day, Griffin Trading and Prudential Securities each bought at least four million bushels March and Refco Inc bought two million March, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;They were the big shorts,&quot; one trader said, referring to funds. &quot;Corn was the pit that was very short.&quot;</p>
<p>The market continued to draw support from slow farmer selling of corn and from USDA's cut in corn production and ending stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>At 1052 CST, corn was 1-3/4 to 3-3/4 cents per bushel lower with March up 3-3/4 at $2.71.</p>
