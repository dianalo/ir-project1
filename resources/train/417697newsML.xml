<p>China on Tuesday denied its restive northwestern region of Xinjiang had been hit by a new bomb attack after three bus bombings last week killed seven people and wounded more than 60.</p>
<p>&quot;It's peaceful here. There's been no untoward incident,&quot; a government official in Yining, or Kuldji, said by telephone.</p>
<p>Mukhiddin Mukhlisi, an exiled spokesman for Uighur nationalists, told Reuters in the Kazakh capital Almaty that his group had staged a bomb attack on a Chinese bus in Kuldji on Monday in reprisal for Beijing government measures against the Moslem ethnic group.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been a lot rumours like this recently... There was no new bomb attack,&quot; another official said.</p>
<p>Mukhlisi accused the Chinese police and army of killing 127 Uighurs and arresting hundreds more in a campaign against nationalists seeking an independent homeland, which he said was launched last month.</p>
<p>Mukhlisi said Chinese authorities were pursuing a deliberate policy of bringing in ethnic Han Chinese immigrants to Xinjiang and giving them favourable treatment over Uighurs.</p>
<p>Last week's time-bombs coincided with funeral rites for China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and were the latest example of brewing unrest in the oil-rich region, where most of China's Turkic-speaking Uighurs live.</p>
<p>In February, a huge anti-Chinese riot by local Uighurs broke out in Yining. Chinese officials said nine people were killed.</p>
<p>The riot was one of the largest, most violent demonstrations for independence in Xinjiang since the 1949 communist takeover.</p>
