<p>South Africa's Competition Board has decided to broaden the scope of its investigation into the country's liquor industry to focus on giants KWV and South African Breweries, chairman Pierre Brooks said on Friday.</p>
<p>Brooks said in a statement that he planned to investigate the effects of wine co-operative KWV's plans to convert itself into a company, shareholdings by KWV and SAB in enterprises with which they compete, SAB's distribution system and &quot;other related matters.&quot;</p>
<p>The industry has been hit by controversey in recent months. Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom has taken legal action to prevent KWV's move because he wanted clarity on how this would affect the wine industry and its assets.</p>
<p>Brooks said that he also wanted to investigate an agreement between KWV and the Cape Wine and Spirit Institute, which had initially also opposed KWV's moves to become a company.</p>
<p>SAB dominates the South African beer market and has been engaged in a war of words with comparatively tiny Namibian Breweries, which has been making steady inroads into the market.</p>
<p>Brooks said South Africa's apartheid era government had rejected certain reforms recommended by the Competition Board on the liquor industry in the 1980s and approved a corporate structure that still existed today.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be unreasonable to believe that political considerations featured prominently in the decisions that were taken at the time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In 1995, the board decided to investigate the liquor industry again. &quot;Various developments have taken place since the investigation was initiated which require it to have a more specific enterprise and issue focus,&quot; Brooks said.</p>
<p>More details about the new investigation are to be published on July 4.</p>
