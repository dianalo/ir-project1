<headline>Belgrade bourse turnover down in week to Feb 21.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE) reported on Monday an 8.16 percent decline in its turnover during the week ending February 21 amid tightening liquidity of the banking sector.</p>
<p>Total BSE turnover fell to 22.99 million dinars ($4.13 million) in 185 transactions from 24.936 million in 171 deals a week ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are usually the most active players on this market, but the banking system is hit hard with tight liquidity,&quot; BSE spokespman Milko Stimac told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts said market liquidity began to deteriorate after the central bank's decided last week to include not only deposits but also bank credits extended to other banks in the 15 percent reserve requirement.</p>
<p>The central bank insisted the measure was aimed at reducing interbank activity and was an attempt to channel more funds to cash-starved companies.</p>
<p>But analysts saw the measure as another blow to the banks' activity.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a specific form of tax on interbank credits. Banks are not playing around on the interbank market. They simply have no other place to lend without much risk. As for the companies, it is common knowledge that they almost never pay back what they owe to banks,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>The only response in this situation was for the banks to withdraw their funds instead of paying 15 percent on extended credits, the analyst said.</p>
<p>Traders saw a lack of trade in central bank short-term bonds and wheat contracts as another reason for declining bourse turnover.</p>
<p>The central bank cut down the rate on its 30-day bonds to an annual 88.89 percent from a record high 147.48 percent, and the lower rate does not attract buyers, a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders also cautioned that wheat contracts have lost their attractiveness after the Serbian Commodity Reserve Agency decided not to accept payment by instalments any longer.</p>
<p>For the week ending February 21, the BSE reported the following details:</p>
<p>* Commercial paper accounted for 156 transactions totalling 19.087 million dinars.</p>
<p>* Treasury bills traded 27 times for a volume of 3.604 million dinars.</p>
<p>Interest rates on commercial paper and treasury bills ranged between an annual 331 and 520 percent, with maturity running between three and 30 days.</p>
<p>* There was no trade in central bank short-term bonds.</p>
<p>* The BSE reported only one deal in wheat contracts worth 0.156 million dinars.</p>
<p>* OTC trade in commercial paper and treasury bills fell to 26.857 millon dinars from 33.243 million a week ago.</p>
<p>* OTC trade in giro money, with banks trading teheir surplus liquidity, fell to 17.648 million dinars from 27.19 million a week ago. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
