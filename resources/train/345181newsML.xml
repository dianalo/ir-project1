<p>In the briefing, written before the October 12, 1996 election, the department said outstanding loans totalled $1.6 billion and were expected to reach $4.6 billion by the year 2001.</p>
<p>It estimated $119 million would be repaid this year rising to $326 million by the turn of the century.  </p>
<p>The number of students with loans is expected to grow to 500,000 by the year 2005 from 157,000 in 1996.</p>
<p>It said more than 75 percent of loans were for less than $10,000.</p>
<p>The department, which collects loan repayments through the income tax system, plans a campaign to encourage voluntary early repayments.</p>
