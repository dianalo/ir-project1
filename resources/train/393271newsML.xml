<p>German coach Berti Vogts hit out at the current qualifying structure for international tournaments on Friday and called for a shake-up in time for the 2000 European Championships.</p>
<p>Vogts wanted to see a reduction in the number of qualifying matches to reduce fixture congestion and the sort of potentially one-sided games which Germany face in their World Cup group against Albania, Ukraine and Armenia.</p>
<p>&quot;We're on a hiding to nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;Until we play our game in Berlin against (group second favourites) Portugal, the fans and the media will be expecting victories as a matter of course.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't get even favourable headlines unless we win at least 5-0, and even then three of them will have to be 'Goals of the Month'.&quot;</p>
<p>Vogts suggested that the system being used for the 1998 World Cup where nine groups will, through a series of play-offs, eventually produce 14 European qualifiers should be simplified for the European Championships.</p>
<p>He advocated a system of 14 smaller groups with the winners progressing to the finals where they would join co-hosts Belgium and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Vogts said cutting group sizes would not only reduce the physical pressures on players but also leave time for more lucrative friendlies againts top nations.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we could think about a tournament with Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, England and us,&quot; he said.</p>
