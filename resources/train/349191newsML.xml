<p>A parliamentarian who lost his right to defend his Conservative seat at the next election after calling Prime Minister John Major &quot;a ventriloquist's dummy&quot; has said he wants to stand against the ruling party.</p>
<p>Sir George Gardiner, a leading Eurosceptic who fears Brussels is encroaching on British sovereignty, was on Thursday deselected as a Conservative candidate by local party officials in the southern English constituency of Reigate.</p>
<p>He said in a newspaper article to be published on Sunday that he intends to stand as a &quot;genuine Conservative&quot; in the election Major must hold by next May.</p>
<p>Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Gardiner maintained his criticism of Major, saying the prime minister was &quot;so washed up we could see he was very near to throwing in the towel&quot; at a meeting with rank-and-file Conservative members of parliament.</p>
<p>Gardiner has been a persistent critic of Major over Europe, the issue that has caused so much internecine strife in the ruling party.</p>
<p>The Conservatives trail the opposition Labour in opinion polls in the runup to the election.</p>
