<p>Tribune Co. would most likely sell its new Miami television station before its newspaper in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., next year unless federal regulators change the rules on cross-ownership, analysts said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tribune, which completed its $1.13 billion purchase of Renaissance Communications Corp. Tuesday, would be forced to sell either the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel newspaper or Renaissance's WDZL-TV in Miami within 12 months under current Federal Communications Commission rules.</p>
<p>FCC regulations bar certain media combinations, including owning more than one television station in a single market, owning a radio station and a newspaper and owning a television station and a newspaper. The FCC sometimes grants waivers in the case of acquisitions to reflect competitive considerations.</p>
<p>An FCC spokesman said the rules are in place to prevent a single media owner from dominating in a particular market.</p>
<p>The rules were waived for some owners who owned specific media assets before the rules were put into place.</p>
<p>Renaissance also owns television stations in Dallas, Indianapolis, Hartford, Conn., York, Pa., and Sacramento, Calif.</p>
<p>&quot;If (the FCC) doesn't change its policy, I would be surprised if Tribune kept the television station instead of the newspaper,&quot; John Morton, an analyst at Morton Research, said. &quot;A local paper will bring in three to four times the revenue of a local television station, even if it has somewhat lower margins.</p>
<p>The FCC granted a 12-month waiver of its cross-ownerhsip rules in order to give Tribune, whose holdings include the Chicago Tribune newspaper, television superstation WGN and the Chicago Cubs professional baseball team, enough time to sell one of the properties, according the agency's conditional approval order.</p>
<p>Earlier, a Tribune spokeswoman said the media conglomerate was confident it would be able to keep both properties in light of an expected review of the FCC's policies in 1998.</p>
<p>James Goss, an analyst at Nesbitt Burns, said there was a sense among media companies and observers the FCC may change its rules regarding cross-ownership, although there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>&quot;There's at least some possibility (Tribune) may be able retain both,&quot; Goss said.</p>
<p>Goss added that while Tribune has been moving deeper into broadcasting, it would be easier to replace WDZL-TV among its holdings than the Sun-Sentinel.</p>
<p>&quot;There are only a handful of newspapers like the Sun-Sentinel,&quot; Goss said.</p>
<p>&quot;(Tribune) would have a better chance of getting a comparable television station in another market than they would (obtaining) a similar newspaper property,&quot; Goss said.</p>
<p>Charles Baker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the case represented a logical chance for the FCC to take a closer look at its policies on cross-ownership of media properties.</p>
<p>&quot;If the FCC wants a test case, Tribune is in a position to provide exactly that opportunity without confusing things in the marketplace,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's evidence (in Chicago and other markets) that Tribune (buying a station) doesn't lead to an Orwellian domination of a market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, Baker believes the television station would be more valuable to Tribune if it was forced to choose.</p>
<p>&quot;If push came to shove, I believe a television station in Miami would be more valuable to the company than a newspaper in Ft. Lauderdale,&quot; Baker said.</p>
<p>Including the Renaissance holdings, Tribune owns 16 network-affiliated televison and five radio stations, daily newspapers and is an equity investor in America Online Inc. and other emerging media companies.</p>
<p>Its shares closed up $1.25 at $42.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
