<p>Philippine banks are strong enough to weather the storm of a tumbling peso and surging interest rates, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>First half earnings released in the past week by the country's biggest banks -- Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co (Metrobank), Philippine National Bank, and Bank of the Philippine Islands -- have been within expectations.</p>
<p>The second half should also be about on track despite the financial turbulence that began simmering in April and reached its peak in July with a de facto devaluation of the peso, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite this kind of volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, we are still not downgrading our earnings forecast (for banks). We think they can hurdle it all,&quot; said Helen Alvarez, research director of All Asia Capital and Trust Corp.</p>
<p>Some analysts were worried that interest rates, at more than two year highs, would cut into lending and that the de facto devaluation would turn foreign currency loans sour.</p>
<p>The peso has fallen around eight percent against the dollar since July 11 when the central bank released its grip on the currency as it -- and other Southeast Asian currencies -- came under relentless speculative attack.</p>
<p>An ING Barings analyst said he expected higher provisioning for bad loans and slower loan growth would bring down banks' earnings growth to an average 20 to 23 percent this year from last year's 28 to 30 percent.</p>
<p>But the slower loan growth should be viewed in a positive light and Thailand's banking problems this year has taught local banks to be extra careful, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're sacrificing short-term earnings for long-term sustainability. The banks have taken a very prudent stance, which is a positive indication that they realise the follies of what happened in Thailand,&quot; ING Barings said.</p>
<p>All Asia's Alvarez argued that the effect of the de facto devaluation would not have too much impact on bank profits.</p>
<p>&quot;We did a very rough estimate and we found for the big banks listed in the market, the effect of devaluation is more on the neutral side,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She noted that payments for foreign exchange loans are covered by foreign currency income.</p>
<p>And fierce competition is likely to be the more persuasive force than high interest rates as banks press ahead with their lending activity, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;That issue will not stop banks from designing innovative (loan) packages,&quot; Alvarez reasoned. &quot;It was a good move for the central bank to liberalise the industry. It forced banks to be competitive and innovative in their pricing.&quot;</p>
<p>Liza Joson, research head of Amsteel Securities, said the currency market will eventually normalise and keep banks on track to meet their profit goals this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the situation is temporary,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Metrobank, which reported first half earnings of 2.73 billion pesos ($94 million), could see a net profit of 6.3 billion at least, Joson said.</p>
<p>BPI, with first half net income at 2.66 billion pesos, is also likely to attain its 4.8 billion-peso target this year, analysts said.</p>
<p>PNB, which reported a net profit of 955 million pesos in the first six months, could also meet its full-year target of 2.1 billion pesos.</p>
<p>(US$1 = 29 pesos)</p>
