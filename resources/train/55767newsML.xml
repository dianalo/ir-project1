<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence chief tried on Monday to calm war jitters in Israel following recent Syrian troop redeployment in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Both Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai assured Israelis there was no real cause for concern but said events in the north were being closely monitored.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last few days there has not been any special (Syrian) movement, but we are following anything that develops on the northern front,&quot; Netanyahu told reporters.</p>
<p>Some 10,000 to 12,000 of Syria's estimated 35,000 troops in Lebanon have redeployed defensively near the Syrian border in recent weeks due to a perceived threat of Israeli attack, Lebanese security sources said on Saturday.</p>
<p>But Israeli media reports have highlighted the troop movements as possible signs that Syria, frustrated over stalled peace talks with Israel over the future of the Golan Heights, might be preparing an attack against the Jewish state.</p>
<p>For many Israelis, their worst nightmare is a repeat of the 1973 Yom Kippur surprise attacks by Syria on the Golan and Egypt in the Sinai peninsula. The Jewish Day of Atonement falls on September 23 this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there is no reason for special concern, we are not complacent,&quot; said Netanyahu, who won election last May pledging to boost Israel's security. &quot;We are monitoring all the moves while continuing our attempts to resume peace talks with Syria.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister took reporters' questions during a photo opportunity in his office and Mordechai summoned military correspondents to the defence ministry in Tel Aviv for a special briefing about the Syrian redeployment.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been following in recent days movements of the Syrian army that took place on the Syrian-Lebanese border,&quot; Mordechai said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are weighing the signficance of these movements but in my best judgment, there is no reason for concern,&quot; he said in remarks broadcast on Israel and Army radios.</p>
<p>Israel Radio reported that &quot;calming messages&quot; were relayed between Israel and Syria over the weekend.</p>
