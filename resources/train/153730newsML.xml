<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot natgas prices continued to strengthen in the Midcontinent and western markets Wednesday on prospects of cold weather late this week, with notional talk of stronger prices in the Gulf as well.</p>
<p>Prices in the Permian basin for baseload November gas were talked in the mid-$2.70s, up more than 10 cents from Tuesday's level.</p>
<p>For the remaining day of October, Permian prices ranged anywhere from the $2.80s to the low-$3 area as buyers scrambled for gas to meet balancing requirements.  </p>
<p>In the Midcontinent, where temperatures were expected to dip to at least 10 degrees Fahrenheit below-normal on Thursday, November pricing climbed into the high-$2.70s. However, no deals could be confirmed done since nomination deadlines had expired.</p>
<p>At the Chicago city-gate, the market was notionally talked around $3.10-3.20.</p>
<p>In the Gulf, where November trading had come to a halt, early talk of November pricing was higher in the low-$2.80s, but no deals were confirmed done.</p>
<p>Sparking these expectations for stronger aftermarket prices was the forecast for below- to much-below-normal temperatures in parts of the Midwest, Rockies and Northwest in the first week of November.</p>
<p>In the eastern U.S., however, forecasters were calling for normal to slightly above-normal temperatures during this period.</p>
<p>Separately, Shell Midstream Enterprises reported earlier Wednesday that its Yellow Hammer gas plant in Coden, Ala., would resume normal service Thursday.</p>
