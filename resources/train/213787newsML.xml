<p>Nigeria's non-oil sector can achieve a 7.5 percent growth yearly if economic reforms in place since last year were maintained, according to a World Bank report in preparation.</p>
<p>&quot;If reforms of 1995-96 are sustained and others quickly put in place, Nigeria can grow the non-oil economy at 7.5 percent per year, reduce poverty, and protect the environment,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Excerpts of the study made available to Reuters said recent government decisions like retaining fiscal discipline, creating a market-determined exchange rate, removing barriers to foreign investments and ownership were preconditions for renewed growth.</p>
<p>Entitled &quot;Prospects for Development&quot;, it said that by the year 2010 Nigeria's economy could be much less dependent on oil, which currently provides 90 percent of its foreign income.</p>
<p>The year 2010 is when Nigeria should have achieved economic prosperity under the &quot;Vision 2010&quot; programme launched by military ruler General Sani Abacha last month.</p>
<p>Last year Abacha, an infantry general who seized power in the chaos unleashed when the army annulled a poll in 1993 to restore democracy, introduced liberal economic policies amidst a tight fiscal regime that has stabilised the exchange rate and reduced inflation rate to under 30 percent from 80 percent.</p>
<p>But the policy of &quot;guided deregulation&quot; which is termed home-grown has yet to induce the level of growth that will make a difference in people's living standards.</p>
<p>&quot;Rapid growth coupled with drastic redirection in public expenditure would lower not only the percentage of people living in poverty, the absolute number of Nigerians living below the poverty line will shrink,&quot; said the new report.</p>
<p>A 2.2 percent rate recorded last year was regarded by experts as negative given the population growth rate of 2.9 percent. The central bank expects a growth of four percent this year but the actual figure will not be known until next year's fiscal budget is announced in January.</p>
<p>Last year government also created a solid minerals ministry to collate data on the non-oil sector and determine how to tap abundant resources like coal, tin and marble among others.</p>
<p>Some success was recorded in October when for the first time since the 1970s when Nigeria last exported coal, it shipped the commodity to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The World Bank report suggested additional policies it said would help to create rapid growth and reduce poverty in Africa's most populous country of 100 million.</p>
<p>These include continued macroeconomic reforms through selective reductions in expenditure, removal of subsidies on fuel and fertiliser; redirection in public expenditures and reform of the public sector to ensure greater accountability and transparency in planning and budgeting.</p>
<p>Central Bank governor Paul Ogwuma said last Thursday in a newspaper interview that reflationary policies would be introduced in next year's budget to try to achieve a growth rate in the gross domestic product of between five to 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>Nigeria plunged into political turmoil over the 1993 vote cancellation and Abacha is implementing a new plan to hand over to an elected president in 1998.</p>
