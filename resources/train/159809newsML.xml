<p>Romanians, who vote on Sunday in the third election since the December 1989 fall of communism, remain at odds over just what the violent overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu meant.</p>
<p>President Ion Iliescu, brought to power by the events and now seeking a new four-year term, says it was a popular revolt by a people throwing off 50 years of hardline rule.</p>
<p>Intellectuals, opposition politicians and most of those who took part in Eastern Europe's bloodiest upheaval of the late 1980s say it was a coup by middle-ranking communists who felt the megalomaniac Ceausescu had outlived his usefulness.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing I know is that I lost my only son and have a granddaughter without a father,&quot; said a woman weeping at the entrance to Bucharest's Heroes' cemetery -- where victims are honoured by hundreds of imposing marble crosses.</p>
<p>The latest 519-page parliamentary report on the events, drafted but still unpublished after four years of enquiries, leaves the debate largely unresolved.</p>
<p>The report was the second major inquiry into what happened, prompted by inaction from a judicial investigation into why hundreds of unarmed protesters were killed -- and by whom.</p>
<p>Statistics show 1,200 people were killed and thousands wounded after crowds poured into streets to denounce Ceausescu -- initially on December 16 when residents of the western city of Timisoara vowed to prevent the arrest of a popular priest.</p>
<p>Bucharest, cut off from the world by the Securitate secret police, followed with protests five days later.</p>
<p>&quot;From December 16 to 22 we had a revolution. What followed until the end of 1989, was a coup,&quot; said Adrian Dumitrescu, head of one of 140 associations of &quot;revolutionaries&quot; who took part in the events.</p>
<p>His is a widespread belief.</p>
<p>Sceptics say the revolution ended on December 22, 1989 at noon, when Ceausescu and his wife Elena fled angry crowds by helicopter from the roof of the Central Committee of the now-defunct Communist Party in central Bucharest.</p>
<p>Of the 1,200 victims, more than 940 were killed after the Ceausescus were captured, subjected to a hasty trial and executed by firing squad on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>They were charged with genocide, undermining the economy and holding more than $1 billion in secret accounts abroad.</p>
<p>Romanian television has repeatedly screened film of the uncomprehending Ceausescus standing trial in procedures since denounced by legal experts. No footage exists of the moment they were shot outside a military barracks.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding the revolt are largely absent from debate in the November 3 presidential and parliamentary elections, superseded by widespread poverty and the widening gap between Romania and other former communist states in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>But election film clips for Iliescu's two main rivals, academic Emil Constantinescu and former prime minister Petre Roman, have been liberally infused with scenes from 1989.</p>
<p>Roman is shown speaking from the balcony of the Communist Party headquarters before he and Iliescu formed the National Salvation Front (FSN) to steer the country through the aftermath of the upheaval. The two men split in 1991 after Roman was forced out of office as prime minister.</p>
<p>Iliescu and the ruling Party of Social Democracy (PDSR) which grew out of the FSN deny that he and other middle-ranking former communists took control of the uprising.</p>
<p>In annual speeches marking the December anniversary, Iliescu says the upheaval was a revolt against misery by people fed up with the &quot;former regime&quot;. He says victims died because the Securitate fiercely resisted Ceausescu's overthrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody can contest Romania's revolution, which was spontaneous, Romanian, national and anti-communist,&quot; Sergiu Nicolaescu, vice-president of the commission of enquiry and a leading PDSR member, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The only concession he and others make is that the revolt unleashed a &quot;power struggle&quot; between Iliescu and hardliners.</p>
<p>&quot;The struggle which erupted on December 22 between Iliescu and a group of hardline communists led by Verdet, does not eliminate the idea that a revolution had taken place,&quot; Nicolaescu said.</p>
<p>Ilie Verdet was prime minister in the early 1980s and sidelined by Iliescu in 1989.</p>
<p>But his career was far from over. He made a come-back after his Socialist Labour Party joined Iliescu's PDSR in 1992 as one of several junior partners in a parliamentary coalition.</p>
<p>Senator Valentin Gabrielescu, the commission's chairman and a member of the opposition Democratic Convention (CDR), is unabashed in saying Iliescu hijacked the revolt.</p>
<p>&quot;Iliescu is morally responsible for deaths after December 22 when Ceausescu left,&quot; he said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;A hysteria was created over so-called terrorists. Iliescu fanned false beliefs that these mysterious &quot;terrorists' were fighting against the revolution.&quot;</p>
<p>Relatives of the dead and wounded survivors have all but lost hope that the truth will ever be known.</p>
<p>Cynical jokes circulate that in the absence of reasonable explanations, the victims must have died by breathing in air filled with bullets fired by army and militia officers.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately this joke must be the closest we will get to the truth,&quot; said Dumitrescu. &quot;Nobody has been sentenced or put on trial for the shootings.&quot;</p>
