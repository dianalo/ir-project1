<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures charged sharply higher in late Thursday trading, lifting benchmark July to a new one-year high of $1,940 a tonne on renewed fund buying.</p>
<p>Fund stop-loss buying was triggered as prices crossed the $1,900 mark, traders said. By the close, July stood at $1,933, still a sharp $63 gain on the day.  </p>
<p>After hovering at around $1,880 in the morning, July vaulted above the pyschological $1,900 level in late afternoon before clearing a chart resistance at $1,930.</p>
<p>It rose futher but failed to pierce the $1,940 mark. The next layer of resistance is pegged at $1,950.</p>
<p>Robustas prices were at the highest levels since May last year when the market surged ahead of Brazilian frost scares.</p>
<p>There were no crop-damaging frost last year or in 1995. Two severe frosts, one in June and another in 1994 destroyed Brazilian cherries.</p>
<p>A drought that followed took London prices to 10-year highs of $4,140 in September 1994.</p>
<p>Prices then took a tumble to hit a two-year low of $1,203 in January this year. Then as supply concern reignited in Latin America, the current new rally gathered momentum to take the market back up.</p>
<p>Robusta prices alone had risen by 61 percent so far this year.</p>
<p>Brazil's frost season is fast approaching and with the current tight supply situation of good quality coffee, the market can ill afford another blow to supply.</p>
<p>Volume in London reached 7,873 lots, centered in July contract. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
