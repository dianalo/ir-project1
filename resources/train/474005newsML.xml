<p>Russia striker Anatoly Kanishchev has gone missing on the eve of a World Cup qualifier in Cyprus, national team coach Boris Ignatiev said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know where he is. All I can say is he isn't here,&quot; Ignatiev told Reuters by telephone from the squad hotel in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Kanishchev took a knock in Alania Vladikavkaz's 2-1 defeat by CSKA in Moscow last Saturday but Ignatiev, contradicting other Russian officials, said it was not injury but disappearance that would keep the striker from playing in the European group five game.</p>
<p>After being allowed to miss the pre-departure squad session to make a personal trip to southern Russia, the three-times capped 25-year-old failed to turn up for the flight to Cyprus and had not been heard from since.</p>
<p>A club official at Vladikavkaz said: &quot;No one knows where Kanishchev has got to.&quot;</p>
<p>His absence means Ignatiev will be relying on the Italy-based striking partnership of Bologna's Igor Kolyvanov and Reggiana's Igor Simutenkov to secure maximum points and a healthy goal tally against the injury-hit Cypriots.</p>
<p>Experienced Oviedo central defender Viktor Onopko will cover Sinica Gogic, whose two goals sank Israel 2-0 in November. Strike partner Costas Malekkos will also be a tightly marked man, Ignatiev said, as the Russians aim to mop up counter-attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;We still face both games against our toughest opponents in the group, Bulgaria. At this stage every point is worth its weight in gold,&quot; Ignatiev said.</p>
<p>Russia lead group five on goal difference from Israel, with Bulgaria a point behind.</p>
