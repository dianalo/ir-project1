<headline>Europe troubles to reverberate at Denver summit.</headline>

<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Europe's drive to launch a single currency appears to have run into trouble, raising tensions that are likely to reverberate at this month's summit of industrial nations, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are at best stationary and may be slipping backwards,&quot; the official, who declined to be named, said of the EU's plans to forge European monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>France threw those plans into turmoil Monday when it asked for time to study the stability pact that will govern budget policy after the single currency's start in 1999.</p>
<p>The pact, agreed after hard-fought negotiations in Dublin, Ireland, in December, was supposed to be ratified by EU leaders when they meet in Amsterdam, Netherlands, next week.</p>
<p>A few of those leaders -- from Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- will then travel to Denver for the annual summit of industrialised democracies on June 20-22. President Bill Clinton and the leaders of Canada, Japan and Russia will also attend.</p>
<p>&quot;A subtext or subtheme of the (Denver) summit will be EMU,&quot; the senior U.S. official told Reuters. &quot;There's going to be either explicitly or right below the surface a lot more tension among the Europeans.&quot;</p>
<p>European leaders, fresh from their meeting in Amsterdam, will want to report on their deliberations to the summit, and perhaps reassure their counterparts outside Europe about their determination to press ahead with EMU, he said.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. official, the difficulties that Europe is having in forging monetary union raise questions about its long-term economic health and regional integration.</p>
<p>&quot;The developments of the last few weeks, which have raised questions about the conclusion of EMU, will probably resonate beyond strict monetary and fiscal issues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the questions about Europe are likely to come to the fore again if there are basic questions about what was regarded as the next logical step, monetary union,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. official said that there is little the United States can or should do now in response.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going have to wait and see what resolution the Europeans eventually come to, whether in Amsterdam next week or in subsequent summits,&quot; he said. &quot;Then we will probably be in a better position to at least project what the likely impact on us will be.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. interest from the start of the EMU project has been in sustained economic growth in the region, the official said. That will help the world economy and boost U.S. exports.</p>
<p>&quot;Our message has always been that we're for any measures that produce a strong European economy,&quot; he said. &quot;The question of EMU and how they do it is something for them to decide. We can't play much of a productive role in that.&quot;</p>
