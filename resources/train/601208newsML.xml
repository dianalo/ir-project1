<p>Bulgaria's pesident Petar Stoyanov on Wednesday warned the newly elected cabinet led by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov of hardships involved in hauling the country out of economic crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government has to win the war against poverty, the war against corruption, the war against crime, the war against inflation and the war for restoring the confidence and self-esteem of Bulgarians,&quot; Stoynaov told parliament.</p>
<p>With 179 votes for, the 240-seat assembly appointed as prime minister Kostov, the leader of the reformist Union of Democratic Forces.</p>
<p>Speaking immediately after parliament appointed Kostov's cabinet, Stoyanov said that Bulgaria's recovery and prosperity depended on the successful rule of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>&quot;I will keep my fingers crossed throughout this cabinet's rule,&quot; said Stoyanov.</p>
<p>Introducing an IMF-prescribed currency board system in July, which is a restrictive fixed exchange rate regime designed to stabilise the country's shaky banks and volatile currency will be among new cabinet's first tasks.</p>
<p>An IMF mission is now in Sofia to complete the preparations for the currency board.</p>
<p>Passing this year's budget by end-June, closing loss-making state enteprises, speeding up privatisation and providing sufficient safety nets for those who are most affected by restructuring is among Kostov's priorities.</p>
<p>Setting up a Foreign Investment Council and promoting investment opportunities in Bulgaria through road shows is also on the cabinet's agenda, said Kostov.</p>
<p>Stoyanov praised the previous interim cabinet for its beneficial legacy to Kostov's government.</p>
<p>In its three-month rule the interim cabinet is credited with negotiating a $657 million accord with the International Monetary Fund, stabilising the national currency, and bringing grain and fuel shortages under control and freeing prices and trade rules for most goods.</p>
<p>Monthly inflation has slowed to 0.7 percent in April from 243 percent in February, but year-on-year inflation remains at galloping 1,965 percent.</p>
<p>The lev has stabilised to around 1,550 to the dollar from 3,000 in January and central bank foreign exchange reserves have grown to $1.250 billion in May.</p>
<p>&quot;This cabinet will meet people's expectations if it succeeds in battling crime and corruption, set clear banking regulations, restore confidence and raise living standarts,&quot; said Stoyanov.</p>
