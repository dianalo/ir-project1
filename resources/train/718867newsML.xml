<p>Serbia's new finance minister Borislav Milacic said on Thursday his first task would be to consolidate the republic's debts to major users of budget funds, state news agency Tanjug reported.</p>
<p>Milacic told reporters after being elected by Serbian parliament he would first determine how much has been done so far in meeting the government's committments to pensioners, teachers and social workers.</p>
<p>&quot;This government does not have much time left because elections are before us, but I accepted this task convinced the conditions and intention exist for the state to meet its obligations from the budget towards users,&quot; Milacic is quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Milacic, 44, replaces Dusan Vlatkovic who was appointed governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia in late June.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate the Yugoslav state's debt to citizens has grown to some 10 billion dinars by the end of May, some five billion of which was to the pension fund alone and another 1.7 billion for child, maternity and other social benefits.</p>
<p>The Belgrade-based Institute for Economic Sciences said in its latest report only 53 percent of planned revenues were collected for the federal, 70 percent for the Serbian and 67 percent for the Montenegrin budgets by the end of May.</p>
<p>The government has forecast 1997 public spending at 47.5 percent of gross domestic product, planned to rise 13 percent to 103.28 billion dinars. But analysts estimate that public spending accounts for 50-55 percent of GDP. -- Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 311 4305</p>
