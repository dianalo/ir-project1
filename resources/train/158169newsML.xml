<p>Persistently low refining margins and a poor chemicals market hurt third-quarter results for oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which saw net earnings fall seven percent despite strong crude oil prices.</p>
<p>Earnings for the Anglo-Dutch multinational fell to 1.117 billion pounds ($1.82 billion) from 1.202 billion, slightly lower than most analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>Overall refining earnings fell 27 percent in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Nick Antill, analyst at BZW, attributed the weak earnings mostly to an unusually high exploration write-off of 211 million pounds, which compares to 131 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a mere random event and has nothing to do with what actually happens in the quarter,&quot; Antill said.</p>
<p>Overall results excluded an 84-million pounds exceptional gain after a divestment in South Africa in the chemicals sector.</p>
<p>In the chemicals sector, the group's earnings dropped 40 percent as prices still showed no firm sign of recovering from the slump that started about a year ago.</p>
<p>Oil prices, which have surged to their highest levels since the Gulf War, will remain volatile, while the chemicals sector only shows improvements in limited parts of the business, Royal Dutch/Shell Group said.</p>
<p>&quot;Along with the industry, change can only come when there is significant growth in the industrial economies,&quot; the company, one of the world's biggest, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch Petroleum owns 60 percent of the group, and the remainder is held by Britain's Shell Transport and Trading.</p>
<p>A year-on-year rise of about $4.75 in the average oil price per barrel boosted production and exploration results. Increased crude production and gas sales outside the U.S. also helped.</p>
<p>Upstream earnings consequently climbed 74 percent, Royal Dutch/Shell Group said.</p>
<p>The oil price spike was due to lower-than-expected production in non-OPEC countries, low stock levels and the fact Iraq was not allowed to resume exports.</p>
<p>But the higher oil price also meant higher costs for the refining operations and offset a surge in European middle distillate prices, Royal Dutch/Shell Group said.</p>
<p>Margins in the Asia-Pacific region were significantly weaker than in the second quarter, but slightly higher than in the same period last year.</p>
<p>In the United States, where Shell and Texaco Inc plan to escape industry-wide overcapacity through a massive merger of their downstream operations, maintenance shutdowns hurt results.</p>
<p>Analyst Irene Himona at SocGen said &quot;Overall, there were no great surprises. It's just slightly disappointing.&quot;</p>
<p>In London, Shell's shares fell 7-1/2p to 10.13 pounds, while Royal Dutch lost 2.80 guilders to 283.20 on the Amsterdam stock exchange.</p>
