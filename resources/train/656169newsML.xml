<p>Sao Paulo state power firm Cia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL) said electricity consumption in its concession area rose 8.9 percent in 1997's first five months versus the same period last year.</p>
<p>CPFL also said in a statement that May power consumption was 2.1 percent higher than the same month last year and up six percent from April.</p>
<p>The company said 1.39 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy was consumed last month, bringing to 7.26 million MWh the amount of electricity consumed from January through May.  </p>
<p>The number of days in the five-month period this year, however, was 154 compared with 149 days in January-May 1996, so the real hike in power consumption over the period was 5.4 percent, it added.</p>
<p>Industry was responsible for 40.7 percent of the total, consuming 2.96 million MWh in the first five months, up 10.4 percent from the same period last year, CPFL said.</p>
<p>May industrial consumption reached 558,994 MWh, up 1.5 percent from May 1996 and 7.6 percent from April.  </p>
<p>Residential consumption, which accounted for 29.8 percent of CPFL's sales, climbed to 2.16 million MWh in the January-May period, an eight percent rise from the same period last year, it said.</p>
<p>The sector's consumption reached 416,562 MWh in May, up 1.9 percent from the same month last year and down 5.1 percent from April, it added.</p>
<p>Commercial consumption, which made up 13.5 percent of the total, increased 10.1 percent to 979,319 MWH in the five-month period versus the same period in 1996, the statement said.  </p>
<p>May's commercial consumption rose to 181,157 MWh, a 2.1 percent hike from May 1996 and a 9.2 percent drop from April.</p>
<p>CPFL gained 7,112 new customers last month, bringing its constomer base to 2,381,169, up 4.5 percent from May 1996.</p>
<p>CPFL, considered by analysts to be the jewel of the Sao Paulo electrical sector, is expected to be sold by October in the first sell-off in Sao Paulo state's privatization program.</p>
