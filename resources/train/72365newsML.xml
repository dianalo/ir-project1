<p>UK overnight cash rates firmed as a shortage of 1.6 billion stg was not fully covered, with late business reported at around 7.0 percent. General collateral (GC) rates followed suit.</p>
<p>* It was an expensive day for cash, with most business done at 5-3/4 percent and little money changing hands at less than 5-11/16</p>
<p>* Bank of England assistance totalled 1.449 billion stg</p>
<p>* Rates at the longer end were also firmer, with one-year money at 6-1/14 1/8.</p>
<p>* FOMC meeting continues to cash a shadow. &quot;If the Fed leaves rates unchanged, things may go off the boil a little here,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>* GC rates tracked cash, with overnight firming to around 8.0 percent in late business.</p>
<p>* 8.0 percent gilts due 2003 remained the main special stock, trading at between 3.0 and 4.0 percent overnight</p>
<p>* 6.0 percent gilts due 1999 were quoted at about 50 points through GC for one and two weeks</p>
<p>* 7.0 percent gilts 2001 were 75 points through GC for one and two weeks</p>
<p>* 6.75 percent gilts due 2004  were 50 to 60 bp through GC</p>
<p>* Wednesday's auction of 3.0 billion stg of 8.0 percent gilts due 2021 has so far generated little interest in gilt repo market.</p>
<p>* Traders said the market was becoming more jittery about interest rates, with more people viewing a UK rate rise as a possibility in the next few months.</p>
