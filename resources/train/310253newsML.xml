<title>UK: UK job centres offer mainly low pay work - survey.</title>
<headline>UK job centres offer mainly low pay work - survey.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-15</dateline>

<p>Vacancies at British job centres are mainly for poorly paid work with some paying less than one pound an hour, a new survey by the Trades Union Congress shows.</p>
<p>The report showed almost half the vacancies surveyed paid less than 3.70 stg ($6.19) an hour, with the lowest rate at 74p an hour for a nanny.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 jobs surveyed in England and Wales paid an average weekly wage of 168.90 stg for a full-time job, almost half the national average.</p>
<p>Nearly a third paid less than 61 pounds a week and one in three vacancies were part-time, according to the survey by the TUC Unemployed Centres.</p>
<p>On top of that, one in 10 jobs on offer were for more than 48 hours a week, in contravention of European Union rules on maximum working hours.</p>
<p>TUC general secretary John Monks said: &quot;The survey shows that the jobs on offer are likely to be low paid and part-time. Many of the full-time jobs pay so little that people will have to do excessive hours just to receive a living wage.&quot;</p>
<p>Doug Low of the TUC unemployed centres network said that from this week, under the new Jobseeker's Allowance which replaced old-style unemployment benefit in October, people will no longer be able to refuse a job on the grounds that it pays too little.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's plan of transferring people from out-of-work poverty to in-work poverty has been exposed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics will release official unemployment statistics for December at 0930 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of economists found a consensus forecast that Britain's jobless queues were reduced by 30,000 last month, following a record drop of 96,000 the month before.</p>
