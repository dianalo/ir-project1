<p>Italian Labour Minister Tiziano Treu said on Saturday &quot;a final effort&quot; was required to reach a deal between employers and engineering and metalworkers in their protracted pay dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have to make a final effort. It's been too long, too many months, that a million and a half workers have been waiting for this: so we're giving it all we've got,&quot; Treu told reporters in Milan.</p>
<p>Treu was due to meet representatives of the workers' three trades unions later on Saturday in Rome to iron out the final details of a possible settlement of the bitter dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;Progress has been made,&quot; he said, adding that he hoped a deal would be reached &quot;soon&quot; even if &quot;it is always best to be vigilant until the very end&quot;.</p>
<p>Union leaders had said on Thursday that they hoped a deal could be reached by Sunday.</p>
<p>Talks between unions and employers resumed last Monday for the first time in more than a month to try to end the dispute which involves some 1.7 million workers in a sector which accounts for 40 percent of industrial output.</p>
<p>The sector's two-year contract expired in June.</p>
<p>Any deal is likely to set the tone for other pay accords andy prove key to Italy's hopes of containing inflation.</p>
