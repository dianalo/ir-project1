<text>
<p>LIFFE sugar rose in active trading Thursday although the apparent volume was much inflated by switches and trade against actuals.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no real news,&quot; one trader said. Most of today's activity was driven by market players selling into expiry, he said, referring to the expiry of the May contract.</p>
<p>By around 1500 GMT there were some 800 AA trades and 500 spreads included in the total volume, the trader said. &quot;The rest is trade to trade business, he said.</p>
<p>Total volume by 1504 GMT was 2,859 lots, of which 2,140 were on May, which was $1.80 higher at $309.90, off a high of $310.20</p>
<p>Some short covering helped the market to rise earlier in the day and it had held on well to the higher levels reached, the trader said.</p>
