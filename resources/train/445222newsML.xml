<p>Republicans agree with President Clinton that working parents should be able to chose between time off with their families or extra pay for overtime, Representative Sue Myrick said Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with President Bill Clinton when he said in his State of the Union address that workers should have the choice to be paid for overtime or trade it in for time off to be with their families,&quot; Myrick said in the weekly Republican radio address. She is from North Carolina.</p>
<p>The House is scheduled to vote next week on a Republican bill allowing employees to choose between paid compensatory time off or overtime pay.</p>
<p>But some Democrats say the bill gives employers too much power to pressure workers to take time off instead of overtime pay. Clinton, who supports giving workers more time for family needs, has indicated he may veto this bill in its present form.</p>
<p>&quot;The beauty of 'comp time' is that it empowers the employees -- the hard working moms and dads of America -- to have the flexibility to meet the responsibility of parenting,&quot; Myrick said.</p>
<p>&quot;With comp time, mom and dad will have the flexibility to spend more time with their families. More time to take their child to the doctor or care for an elderly family relative. And, they will do so without the loss of wages on which they depend,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Myrick said comp time had worked well for city employees in Charlotte, North Carolina when she was mayor before coming to Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply put -- and I know this from practical management experience -- comp time works. It works for the employer. It works for the employee. And most importantly, it works for America's families.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids need their parents. And parents need comp time,&quot; she said.</p>
