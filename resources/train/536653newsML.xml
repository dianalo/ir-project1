<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus said on Thursday that he saw reason for cheer in the world economic outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;There are good reasons for us to be in a state of rational exuberance,&quot; Camdessus told reporters.</p>
<p>Among thse reasons are low and falling inflation and solid and rising growth.</p>
<p>In his opening statement at the news conference, Camdessus extolled the benefits of globalization for the world economy and said it was time for countries to take bold action.  </p>
<p>Bold action is not only needed on the national front, but also to strengthen the IMF's ability to cope with the changing world economy, Camdessus said.</p>
<p>He voiced confidence that IMF member nations would give the Fund a mandate to promote the free movement of capital worldwide via capital account liberalization.</p>
<p>Camdessus said the IMF was also working intensely with a variety of countries to help them cope with the economic challenges they face. He defended the IMF against charges that its programs hurt the poor in developing countries and cited statistics that he said showed that the opposite was the case.</p>
