<p>Mauritius opened a three-day meeting of ministers from 14 states on Wednesday to launch the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IORARC) to boost co-operation in trade.</p>
<p>Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam at the opening called for formation of a &quot;small secretariat to inform, coordinate and maintain an official monitor of the progress of agreed projects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are proud to furnish the base for such an administration,&quot; he told delegates from the member states.</p>
<p>But diplomats said the bid by Mauritius to host the secretariat had been opposed in preparatory talks on Tuesday by Australia, which was backed by South Africa and Singapore.</p>
<p>They said establishing a secretariat was seen by some members of the 14-nation association as premature.</p>
<p>The IORARC groups Australia, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Yemen to increase cooperation in investment, infrastructure, tourism, science, technology and human resource development as well as trade.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1993, the Indian Ocean region accounted for 31 percent of the world's population, but 6.3 percent of its GDP (gross domestic product)  and 10.7 percent of its trade. In 1994, intra-IOR trade was only 22 percent of the total,&quot; Ramgoolam said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is huge scope for us to do better. The opportunities are immense and our association is long overdue,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The IORARC took shape in Mauritius last September when its members agreed on a charter for the new regional grouping.</p>
<p>As well as officially launching the IORARC, the meeting in Mauritius until Friday will adopt its charter and study the question of enlarging its membership by accepting an application from France.</p>
<p>It will also decide when and where to convene a heads of states summit.</p>
<p>France applied for membership through the island of Reunion, an overseas department of France with the status of a region. The IOR charter says membership is only open to sovereign Indian Ocean states.</p>
