<p>Empress Michiko was admitted to hospital late on Thursday suffering a high fever and a headache, Japan's Imperial Household Agency said.</p>
<p>Court doctors diagnosed two days ago that the 62-year-old empress had herpes zoster, a form of a virus infection that causes rashes along the nervous system.</p>
<p>Michiko complained of a severe headache and high fever late on Thursday afternoon after attending an awards ceremony in Tokyo, the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;The symptoms of herpes zoster were receding, but we decided to hospitalise her highness to avoid the possibility of her developing meningitis,&quot; court doctor Tatsuo Ikenaga told reporters late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told a news conference on Friday that Michiko's condition appeared stable and the empress was heading for recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;We received an unofficial call (from the Household Agency) that her highness's condition has stabilised, with her headache better and fever lower,&quot; Kajiyama said.</p>
<p>Court doctors said Michiko's illness was probably due to fatigue from a two-week trip to South America in late May, when she accompanied Emperor Akihito.</p>
<p>Akihito and their daughter Princess Nori, 28, visited Michiko at the hospital on Friday morning, and Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto expressed concern.</p>
<p>&quot;I was worried because she wore a bandage on her arm at a tea party (on Wednesday),&quot; Hashimoto told reporters. &quot;Members of the imperial family work too hard fulfilling public duties. She has a headache so it's best she follows her doctors' advice.&quot;</p>
<p>The agency cancelled Michiko's official duties, including a planned meeting on Friday with visiting Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.</p>
<p>The empress collapsed on her 59th birthday in 1993 and lost her power of speech for nearly seven months.</p>
