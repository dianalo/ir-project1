<p>Belgian linear bonds proved remarkably resilient in the face of higher-than-expected U.S. employment figures on Friday, but traders said the market was looking increasingly and unsustainably expensive.</p>
<p>The market, which saw active buying of the new benchmark 2007 OLO as well as heavy trading in the 2012 and 2015 bonds, suffered initially along with its European neighbours when U.S. December non-farm payrolls rose 262,000 against expectations of a rise of just 192,000.</p>
<p>But buying then returned to carry the market against the ebb tide, and the spread over German Bunds narrowed once more.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are no sellers in the Belgian market at the moment. Everybody is a buyer,&quot; one trader said. &quot;But to my mind Belgium is now far too expensive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Europe is incredibly strong. It just doesn't want to go down,&quot; another trader said. &quot;Belgium is extremely expensive compared to Germany.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders noted that the short end of the Belgian yield curve had begun to steepen slightly, in common with Germany, but that the very long end had flattened considerably in recent days.</p>
<p>They said the interest in the very long-dated paper was purely professional, with few end investors seen.  </p>
<p>They also pointed out that much of the focus on the 2007 benchmark bond was due to it seeming relatively cheap -- particularly when the spread over Bunds was taken into consideration. But they said this was an illusion.</p>
<p>Although the 2007 spread over equivalent Bunds had shrunk to just 12 basis points by the close of business on Friday from around 22 at the start of the week, a better basis for comparison was the old 2006 benchmark, they said.</p>
<p>In the old benchmark, the spread over Bunds is hovering at around three basis points -- a gap that traders said was uncomfortably narrow.  </p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 2007 OLO ended Friday at 6.03 percent against Thursday's 6.04, and the spread over Bunds narrowed to 12 basis points from 15.</p>
<p>The March futures contract ended a volatile day one basis point higher at 119.99, in the middle of a 120.21/119.79 range.</p>
