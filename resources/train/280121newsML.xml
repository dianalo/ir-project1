<headline>LIFFE sugar firms, activity good for holiday time.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE sugar futures edged up on Monday in volume which traders described as good considering that many market players were absent ahead of the New Year holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;500 lots on a Monday is not bad,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The market was following New York up, traders said. The rise was no more than a continuation of Friday's trend, they said.</p>
<p>There was some fund buying pushing prices up, but there were sellers above the market to limit gains.</p>
<p>By 1605 GMT, 468 lots had been traded. Front month March was $2.2 higher at $309.40, on volume of 381 lots, which made it by far the most active contract.</p>
<p>On the fundamentals front, Pakistan's sugar production for 1996/97 (July/June) fell 42.87 percent to 388,272 tonnes by December 15 compared to 679,635 tonnes in the year-ago period, Pakistan Sugar Mills Association said on Monday. --Christopher Lyddon, London newsroom +44 171 542 7928</p>
