<p>Leftist guerrillas freed 65 inmates, most of them common criminals, in overnight attacks on two jails in central and southwest Colombia, authorities said on Monday.</p>
<p>Military sources and police said 46 of the prisoners were released during a pre-dawn assault by more than 100 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels on the small town of Caloto in southwestern Cauca province. A guard outside the Palace of Justice was reported killed.</p>
<p>Another 19 prisoners were freed in a raid by suspected FARC commandos on the municipal jail in Soacha, just south of the capital Bogota. The attack came after two women, apparently posing as prostitutes, got guards to open the gates, local news reports said.</p>
<p>The FARC, Colombia's largest and oldest guerrilla group, was founded as a Marxist, pro-Soviet group in 1964. It specialises in kidnappings and protecting rural drug farms and laboratories.</p>
<p>In other developments, the United States made formal delivery at Bogota's international airport on Monday of six UH-1H &quot;Huey&quot; helicopters to help Colombia's fight against the drug trade. U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette said the choppers were the first of 18 that Washington had earmarked to help bolster Colombia's anti-drug fight this year.</p>
