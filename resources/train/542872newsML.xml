<p>Mazel Stores Inc said Monday it expects to earn about $0.17 a share in the first fiscal quarter, or about 30 percent below Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p>The discount retailer earned $0.23 a share on a pro forma basis for the same period last year. It went public last November at $16 a share.  </p>
<p>According to First Call, analysts expect the company to earn $0.24 a share for the quarter.</p>
<p>Mazel held a telephone conference call with investors and analysts on Friday at 1630 EDT/2030 GMT. Before trading in its stock was halted Friday afternoon by Nasdaq, the shares fell 6-5/8, or 34 percent, to 12-5/8 as Wall Street got word that a conference call would be held.</p>
<p>Mazel said it plans to announce its first quarter results during the last week of May.  </p>
<p>Despite the disappointing quarterly earnings, Mazel Chairman and Chief Executive Reuven Dessler said he still feels &quot;comfortable&quot; with analysts' estimates for the full year.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the company is expected to earn $1.08 a share for the year.</p>
<p>Mazel said sales for the first quarter should rise about 25 percent from a year earlier, but same-store sales will fall four to five percent.  </p>
<p>Comparable store sales are based on 13 stores. The 10 stores opened in fiscal 1996 &quot;have siphoned and are expected to continue to siphon sales from the 13 mature stores located in the same market,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>It also cited lower shipments to the stores in the early portion of the quarter, the timing of a large purchase during the quarter, and the later timing of Passover, which hurt sales in its New York and New Jersey markets.</p>
<p>Mazel said wholesale sales to third parties for the first quarter fell 14 percent from last year.</p>
