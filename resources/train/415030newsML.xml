<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets were quiet, with scattered bids of $68 per cwt which were passed, and no reported sales following last week's active trade, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Last week's sales, which brought a top of $69.00 per cwt, provided ample cattle inventories for packers to get through most of this week, sources said. That scenario was expected to keep sales light until later in the week, they said.</p>
<p>Owners were pricing cattle at $70.00 to $73.00, with most at $71.00, several cattle feeders said.  </p>
<p>Strong beef values last week and light supplies of finished cattle last week fueled a cattle price jump of $3.00, compared with the previous week, sources said.</p>
<p>Prices this week were expected to remain steady at $69.00, but could trade higher if the beef market rallies further, they said.</p>
<p>Heavy weight choice beef prices Friday were quoted at $107.18 per cwt, up $11.78 since prices started climbing on Feb 15, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>This week's showlists were seen steady to smaller than last week, feedlot sources said.</p>
