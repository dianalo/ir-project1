<p>Pakistan's National Credit Consultative Council (NCCC) said on Wednesday it had raised the credit target 14.18 percent to 137.1 billion rupees for fical 1996/97 (July-June) from 102 billion in the year ago period after a sharp rise in the first half.</p>
<p>A statement by the State (central) Bank of Pakistan after the NCCC meeting said domestic credit rose 13 percent to 128 billion rupees in the first half compared to a target of 102 billion rupees for the whole year.</p>
<p>&quot;Government borrowing for budgetary support alone accounted for well over 60 percent of total credit expansion up to December 26, 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>The bank said credit to the private sector expanded by 50 billion rupees, indicating an increase of seven billion rupees compared to an actual credit expansion in the private sector in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Money supply increased five percent, or 47.5 billion rupees, by December 26 compared with the overall target of 116 billion rupees for the whole year, the bank said.</p>
<p>Lower monetary expansion was the result of a massive depletion of net foreign assets of the banking system, which neutralised to a very large extent the expansionary impact of domestic credit on money supply, the bank said.</p>
<p>Money supply had now been projected to increase 13.1 percent, or 123 billion, compared to 116 billion rupees provided in the original credit plan for 1996/97, it said.</p>
<p>It said expansion in money supply from the present low level mainly represented a build-up of net foreign assets of the banking system.</p>
