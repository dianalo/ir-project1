<headline>S.Korean parliament speaker faces scandal probe.</headline>

<p>South Korean prosecutors will soon question parliamentary speaker Kim Soo-han over allegations he took money from the founder of the Hanbo Group, a government official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chung Tae-soo, founder of the country's 14th largest conglomerate, told prosecutors he had donated funds to help Kim's parliamentary election campaign in 1992, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prosecutors decided to question the speaker under the principle that everyone, regardless of their position, will be investigated once they are involved in Hanbo-linked suspicions,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Kim was among 33 politicians named by Chung or his aides for having taken money from Hanbo as &quot;political funds&quot;. Chung has denied bribing them.</p>
<p>In a parliamentary hearing broadcast live from a Seoul jail last week, Chung testified that he and his officials gave money to a group of politicians.</p>
<p>The politicians included 20 lawmakers, of whom two are tipped as possible candidates of the ruling New Korea Party in presidential elections due in December.</p>
<p>State prosecutors have already questioned more than half of the politicians, and so far most of them have confessed to receiving money from Hanbo but denied that any favours were given.</p>
<p>Prosecutors on Wednesday questioned the mayor of Pusan and two lawmakers, a prosecution official said.</p>
<p>Chung is on trial for bribery and other charges along with nine others, including three close associates of President Kim Young-sam, in connection with the collapse of Hanbo Steel Co in January under a $5.8 billion debt.</p>
<p>Prosecutors reopened the investigation into the Hanbo scandal last month after opposition parties attacked an earlier probe as a whitewash that failed to bring to justice major players.</p>
<p>The president's son, whose name has been linked to the scandal, is also scheduled to testify on April 25 in the parlimentary hearing.</p>
<p>In February, President Kim apologised over the Hanbo loan scandal and for his second son Hyun-chul's alleged involvement in the the furore.</p>
<p>The younger Kim was exonerated by the prosecution in February when he was summoned for questioning.</p>
