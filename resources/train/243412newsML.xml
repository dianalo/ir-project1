<p>Attempts by the United States to force a debate on labour standards drew fierce resistance on the first day of the World Trade Organisation ministerial meeting here, thrusting the issue to centre stage.</p>
<p>The United States appeared to be losing its battle to use international trade rules to raise Third World standards, eradicate sweat shops and stop an estimated 250 million children working, often in appalling conditions.</p>
<p>The United States, backed by France and Canada, wants the issue to be thrashed out at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which has its own court to resolve trade disputes.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe strongly that increased trade and economic growth that it brings should also engender greater respect for the basic human rights which are the focus of our core labour standards proposal,&quot; U.S. delegate Charlene Barshefsky said.</p>
<p>But the WTO operates by consensus and it was clear from the moment Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong opened the WTO's first ministerial conference on Monday morning that resistance was fierce.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that low labour costs are a legitimate comparative advantage for developing countries and that labour standards should not be used as a disguised protectionist measure,&quot; Goh said in a keynote speech.</p>
<p>Other Asian nations expressed even blunter views.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not see any purpose in bringing this subject into the WTO except possibly to use trade measures to enforce labour standards,&quot; Indian Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah said.</p>
<p>And Malaysia's outspoken international trade and industry minister Rafidah Aziz said: &quot;You don't link trade to human rights. You don't link trade action to labour standards and other social clauses. That is the stand of Malaysia and I am happy to say with many other countries too.&quot;</p>
<p>Mutterings in the corridors were just as blunt. &quot;What about all the sweat shops in the United States. What's Washington doing about them,&quot; one Asian delegate asked Reuters.</p>
<p>A string of Western nations also threw their weight against the United States. Trade ministers from Britain, Australia and Germany all said the WTO meeting, which began five days of talks on Monday, was not the place to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>They agreed with the Asians that the International Labour Organisation (ILO), set up to deal with standards in the workplace, was the right place to deal with the admitted problems in developing nations.</p>
<p>And Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union Trade Commissioner, said his goal this week was to reassure developing countries that Western concern about the issue was for people, not trade.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not have any protectionist intentions. We do not regard cheap labour as unfair trade,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Delegates said host Singapore had reorganised the schedule of the conference to deal with four contentious issues -- agriculture, government procurement, investment and competition, and labour standards, which has become the most bitter.</p>
<p>&quot;They're going to deal with it last and we don't see any way there's going to be a consensus that will come anywhere close to what the Americans want,&quot; said the Asian delegate.</p>
<p>There has been a major outcry in the United States over American firms moving plants -- and jobs -- to developing nations to exploit cheap labour.</p>
<p>Developing countries are eagerly courting such firms, arguing that while wages might seem low by Western standards, foreign firms pay better salaries than domestic companies and create jobs where they are most needed.</p>
<p>They acknowledge that child labour is a major problem and that children should go to school instead of working in mines, quarries, brickworks, or fireworks factories or weaving carpets in dimly-lit hovels.</p>
<p>But they argue that eradicating such problems is a lot more complicated than Americans think. &quot;It's a question of making sure their parents have decent jobs and can afford to send their children to school,&quot; said another Asian delegate.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working on the problem, but we need help, not coercion.&quot;</p>
