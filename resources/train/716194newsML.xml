<title>MEXICO: POLL - Maseca Q2 net seen down.</title>
<headline>POLL - Maseca Q2 net seen down.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>Maize flour and tortilla maker Grupo Industrial Maseca will likely report lower sales and earnings for the second quarter of the year as a consequence of lower maize prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>Lower maize prices during the quarter would mean lower complementary revenues from government subsidies for tortillas, the analysts added.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of three analysts showed they forecast average sales of 1.269 billion pesos in the second quarter for Maseca, down from year-ago figures of 1.808 billion pesos (restated in line with inflation).  </p>
<p>The analysts meanwhile predicted average net earnings of 136 million pesos, or 0.15 peso per share, compared with an adjusted year-ago figure of 0.20 pesos per share.</p>
<p>Tortillas are flat pancakes made from maize dough that have been a Mexican staple for many centuries and are more widely eaten than bread.  They are one of the few basic foodstuffs that still receive a government subsidy in Mexico.</p>
<p>Gregory Rianhard, an analyst with the Interacciones brokerage, said Maseca's second quarter earnings &quot;will not be very good.  I predict production of 497,000 tonnes, or a (year-on-year) decrease of 4.2 percent.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Maseca's (second quarter) earnings report is expected to be poor,&quot; Scott Kolb said, an analyst at the Banorte brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;We forecast a (year-on-year) fall of about 25 percent in sales, between 20-25 percent in operating earnings, and net earnings to be down some 15-20 percent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kolb did, however, forecast a &quot;good&quot; operating margin of around 15 percent, allowing for the fact that it would be lower due to a reduction in financial revenues.  </p>
<p>Isabel Garcia from Accival brokerage wrote in a recent research report that maize prices from April to June fell by some 40 percent in dollar terms since the same period last year.  For this reason, she said, Maseca would likely post &quot;a sharp reduction in complementary earnings and therefore in sales.&quot;  She added &quot;Second quarter numbers will be poor, as Maseca's report will reflect greater (year-on-year) falls in sales and earnings than in the first quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>Marco Vera of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell agreed Maseca was likely to post poor second quarter earnings but nonetheless said the company's shares were atractively priced.</p>
<p>A survey of analysts projections appears below:</p>
