<p>The U.S. corn harvest edged ahead of normal pace for the first time this year last week as a crop that started with problems recovered strongly during its last few weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We continued to fill grain late into the fall and didn't freeze until November. We've had a good corn year,&quot; said Len Nelson, agronomist at the University of Nebraska.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Monday the corn harvest was 88 percent complete as of Sunday, slightly ahead of the five-year average pace of 87 percent.  </p>
<p>Progress in key states in the western Corn Belt was running ahead of normal with Iowa 91 percent, Nebraska 93 percent and Minnesota 95 percent finished versus averages of 87, 87 and 88 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;With all but scattered localities now finished with the corn harvest, the 1996 crop year is ended,&quot; the Minnesota Agricultural Statistics Service said in its weekly update.</p>
<p>Iowa, Nebraska and Minnesota are the first, second and fourth largest corn producing U.S. states, respectively, and were forecast by the USDA to produce a combined 3.77 million bushels this year, more than 40 percent of the crop.  </p>
<p>USDA earlier this month raised its estimates for the overall U.S. crop to 9.265 million bushels, making it the third largest ever.</p>
<p>Weekly state reports indicated, however, there continued to be harvest delays in smaller producing states in the eastern Corn Belt with Ohio particularly dealing with problems.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have a lot (of corn) in the fields and it is not drying down very well,&quot; said Jim Beuerlein, professor of agronomy at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>&quot;The crop was planted late and we didn't collect a lot of sunlight hours and we are paying through the nose for it...it has just been a disaster the whole season,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ohio's corn crop was 61 percent harvested, as of Sunday, behind a five year average of 81 percent over a five-year period, according to the state's weekly crop update.</p>
<p>USDA estimates indicated Ohio looks set to slip to the tenth largest corn producing state this year on output of 313.5 million bushels. Last year it came in sixth with 375.1 million.</p>
