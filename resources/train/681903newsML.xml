<p>At least 18 people were wounded when Jordanian security forces destroying houses built illegally on government land clashed with protesters in the Jordan Valley, newspapers said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said the clashes took place on Sunday in the village of Darar, about 60 km (40 miles) west of Amman after officials arrived with orders to knock the houses down.</p>
<p>The pro-government Ad-Dustour newspaper said 16 security force members were wounded and two civilians &quot;as a result of shooting and throwing of stones&quot;. It did not say how many had been hit by bullets or stones.</p>
<p>The independent Al-Arab Al-Yawm newspaper said around 30 civilians were hurt in the clashes. Other papers said security forces had fired into the air. No one was seriously wounded, they said.</p>
<p>Ad-Dustour quoted parliamentary member Ali Shatti as saying that while he went to authorities to protest against the destruction of the houses, police attacked his own home, where protesters were taking refuge.</p>
<p>He said the police enterd his house, firing bullets and throwing stones, breaking windows and doors and wounding his father and his mother.</p>
<p>Police then refused to help them get treatment, surrounded the house and arrested all inside, he added.</p>
<p>Clashes over land in Jordan, either among tribes or between the government and citizens, are not uncommon but most take place in remote areas where land ownership is disputed.</p>
