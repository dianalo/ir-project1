<p>Iraqi forces fired missiles at U.S. fighter jets over northern Iraq on Wednesday but missed their targets, and the United States moved B-52 bombers to a base in the Indian Ocean to back its threat of new military strikes on Iraq, U.S. defence officials said.</p>
<p>The officials also said an Iraqi MiG-25 jet fighter and a military helicopter flew into a no-fly zone in southern Iraq on Wednesday in violation of U.S. warnings but that no action was taken immediately.</p>
<p>The SAM-6 surface-to-air missiles fired at two U.S. F-16 jets policing a no-fly zone over northern Iraq did not damage the planes, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Our F-15E fighters in the area could not return fire with their (radar-destroying) 'Harm' missiles because the Iraqi radars were turned off quickly,&quot; Whitman said. He said the incident occurred near Gir Pahn, midway between the cities of Zakhu and Mostar.</p>
<p>The missile firings occurred at 3:58 a.m. EDT (0758 GMT), which was late morning in Iraq, and along with the southern zone violations were sure to increase rising tensions between the United States and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The defence officials, who asked not to be identified, said U.S. B-52 bombers like those used in cruise missile attacks on southern Iraq last week had been moved from Guam in the Pacific Ocean to a British air base on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean to put them closer to Iraq.</p>
<p>American warships and B-52s, which flew non-stop more than 19 hours round-trip from Guam, launched 44 Tomahawk and airborne cruise missiles against air defence targets in southern Iraq fighter last week to punish Saddam for using his forces to attack Kurds in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The United States on Tuesday accused Saddam of starting to rebuild his air defences in the south despite direct warnings from U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry and others and warned that U.S. forces could launch new attacks at any time.</p>
<p>Whitman said the two Iraqi aircraft that penetrated the no-fly zone in the south had flown in from the north and were not simply defying the no-fly order by taking off in the zone.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters on Tuesday the United States was determined to keep Saddam from flying in the zones in order to protect Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other U.S. friends to the south.</p>
<p>In Baghdad, the Iraqi News Agency on Tuesday quoted a military spokesman as saying three SAMs were fired at U.S. warplanes policing the southern no-fly zone and chased them away, but U.S. officials dimissed those reports. &quot;We have absolutely no indication of that,&quot; responded Air Force Col. Doug Kennett, a Defence Department spokesman in Washington.</p>
<p>The Pentagon says Saddam has been warned in diplomatic notes and in statements by Defence Secretary William Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, not to rebuild air defences or threaten U.S. planes policing the southern no-fly zone.</p>
<p>Spokesman Ken Bacon hinted on Tuesday the U.S. military might resume attacks, especially if the Iraqis tried to target U.S. aircraft with radars, saying: &quot;We have warned Saddam Hussein that we retain the right and will, in fact, take actions necessary to protect our pilots. And we will do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Saddam has called on his troops to ignore the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq set up by Western powers to protect Kurds in the north and Shiite Moslems in the south.</p>
