<p>Astra USA said Tuesday it named Ivan Rowley as president and chief executive officer, replacing Jan Larsson, who had served as head of the pharmaceutical company since April 29.</p>
<p>Astra USA, a unit of Swedish pharmaceutical giant Astra AB, fired Chief Executive Lars Bildman in late April, accusing him of &quot;improper behaviour&quot; after several former employees alleged in lawsuits he engaged in sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Bildman has denied any wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Rowley, who assumes his new responsibilities immediately, has held a variety of sales and marketing positions with the company, and most recently as vice president of managed care unit Health Alliance.</p>
<p>Larsson will concentrate full-time on his responsibilities as executive vice-president of Astra AB responsible for manufacturing and logistics and as a member of the group executive committee.</p>
