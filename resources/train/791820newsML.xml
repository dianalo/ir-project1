<p>Financier Martin Ebner, for years a thorn in the side of Union Bank of Switzerland UBS, has again rattled Switzerlands' financial establishment by forcing the hands of Credit Suisse Group and Winterthur Group.</p>
<p>By amassing a 30 percent stake in insurer Winterthur and threatening to gain a majority, Ebner put pressure on CS Group and Winterthur to go public with their merger plans.</p>
<p>But Ebner's role went beyond that of determining the timing of the announcement, he also put previous talks into overdrive.</p>
<p>&quot;The massive arrival of a large shareholder in Winterthur posed an uncertainty to the long-term evolution of the cooperation,&quot; Winterthur chairman Peter Spaelti said.</p>
<p>In May Ebner announced that his BZ Trust had acquired 14.5 percent in Winterthur, making it the biggest shareholder.</p>
<p>Since then BZ Trust has raised its stake to 25 percent and other trusted clients of Ebner bought another five percent.</p>
<p>The uncertainty Ebner's stake-building created around Winterthur was one of the reasons that ongoing talks between Credit Suisse and Winterthur about cooperation were upgraded into merger talks.</p>
<p>&quot;This uncertainty was one reason to take the promising, strategically extremely important cooperation with Credit Suisse into a new dimension through a complete merger,&quot; Spaelti told a news conference.</p>
<p>News over the weekend that BZ Trust, part of Ebner's BZ Group, wanted to acquire a majority in Winterthur then added further pressure to announce a deal quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;The letter from the BZ group opened the door for speculation. We wanted to provide clarity for all parties concerned,&quot; CS Group chairman Rainer Gut said.</p>
<p>Carefully-laid plans to announce a merger on Thursday were rapidly altered on Sunday evening and the announcement made Monday morning.</p>
<p>Lukas Muehlemann, designated chief executive of the combined group, also said that Ebner had approved the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had a telephone conversation with Mr. Ebner and he has said that he is positive about the transaction,&quot; Muehlemann told a news conference.</p>
<p>But other factors contributed to accelerating their plans, including the recent sharp gains in Winterthur's share price.</p>
<p>Winterthur registered shares have been the best performer on the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) this year, surging 95 percent from 774 Swiss francs at the start of 1997 to a Friday close of 1,515 francs.</p>
<p>A third factor was the sudden plunge in stock markets on Friday as markets started fearing higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Gut said the sudden turbulence revealed the market risks and underscored the danger of waiting further.</p>
<p>Ebner is Switzerland's most controversial professional investor after a drawn-out fight with management at UBS over how to raise profitibility at the country's biggest bank group.</p>
<p>Legal suits by Ebner have blocked UBS's attempts to change its share structure and accused the bank's management of wilful mismanagement.</p>
<p>With his 30 percent stake in Winterthur, Ebner and his clients will control some six to seven percent of the new group, making him the largest shareholder after Credit Suisse's own employees.</p>
