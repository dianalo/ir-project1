<p>CSCE coffee futures were called to open 3.00 to 4.00 cents lower Friday in a technical correction to this week's blistering rally, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's way overbought,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It is due for a correction, but I'm not sure who is going to sell it.&quot;</p>
<p>New York arabica futures shot up for the third straight day Thursday, with July coffee soaring to a new 20-year high, on a nearly uninterrupted broad-based buying frenzy.</p>
<p>July arabicas jumped to a new lifetime high of 318.00 cents per lb, the highest price since 1977, before closing at 314.80 cents, up 19.25 cents. Second-position September jumped 17.10 cents higher, to 273.80 cents, while the back months rose 6.00 to 14.25.</p>
<p>The July/September spread, a barometer of near-term supplies, widened to 41.00 cents from 38.85 cents at the close on Wednesday. September/December bulged to 45.00 cents from 42.15 cents on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On fundamental side, U.K. trade house ED&amp;F Man said Friday world consumer coffee stocks stood at 10 million bags in April, up from 8.80 million in March and 1.1 million bags higher than in April 1996.</p>
<p>While growth has been concentrated in European ports, Man said April/May coffee report that U.S. stocks increased by 309,000 bags in the last two months to stand at 1.85 million bags.</p>
<p>After Thursday's close, CSCE reported certified coffee stocks dipped 454 60-kg bags, to 49,258 bags as of May 28. There was no coffee pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>In London, robusta futures pulled back early Friday, on profit-taking after Thursday's explosive run-up to 20-month highs. LIFFE July dropped $59 at the midday break, to $2,541, while September fell $53, to $2,577.</p>
