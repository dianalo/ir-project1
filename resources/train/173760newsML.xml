<p>Finnish public spending must be critically examined and since employment is not improving as well as hoped, it would be wrong to conclude that no more cuts were needed, second Finance Minister Arja Alho said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a press summary of a speech to a seminar, she said she could not agree with people who thought enough had been done.</p>
<p>&quot;If employment was developing as has been hoped, I might think that way myself. Since this is not the case, efforts to speed up production growth and make the economy more efficient must be continued,&quot; Alho said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fiscal and income policy major decisions have been made for the next few years. However, the job can not be left there. Besides reforms to improve the function of labour markets, a critical assessment of public expenditure must continue so that the adverse effects of high taxation could be eased,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She said Finland had prerequisities to reach a growth pace of one and a half times the EU average. &quot;It is only up to us whether we can use them,&quot; she said.</p>
