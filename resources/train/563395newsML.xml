<headline>German shares stutter, lose records in late trade.</headline>

<p>The German share market hit a record closing high in bourse trade on Tuesday, powered ahead by overnight gains in the U.S. and Japan, but its advance was scuppered by a sharp dip in the dollar in late trade.</p>
<p>In a volatile late post-bourse session, the IBIS DAX index plunged to a low of 3,537.98 points, 75 points off its record intraday high, before firming partially to close at 3,548.52, down 17.17 points, or 0.5 percent, on the day.</p>
<p>The dollar had hit lows after Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said he did not wish the dollar to rise much further.</p>
<p>That pressured German shares, which had ended bourse trade at mid-afternoon at 3,568.28, up 39.50 points, or 1.12 percent. A weak start on Wall Street, which quickly reversed, added to market uncertainties.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of nerves about. I think it may be time to consolidate,&quot; said a Frankfurt dealer. &quot;It was alarming to see us fall like that, today of all days.&quot;</p>
<p>Diversified energy group Veba held higher through the day, boosted by a first quarter earnings report that dealers said was significantly above expectations.</p>
<p>Veba's shares ended floor trade up 3.45 marks at 93.55 and ended late trade at 92.92 marks, still a rise of three percent.</p>
<p>The firm said its first quarter net profit after minorities rose seven percent to 486 million marks while pre-tax profit rose 6.8 percent to 1.08 billion marks.</p>
<p>Hoechst AG shares climbed 1.73 marks to 68.08 in bourse trade as management board chairman Juergen Dormann told the group's annual meeting that operating profit was expected to show an increase on an adjusted basis in 1997. The shares dropped in later trade to end at 66.35 marks, down 43 pfennigs.</p>
<p>Among the biggest decliners in late trade, a move attributed to profit-taking, was Daimler-Benz AG which dropped 3.50 marks, or 2.6 percent, to 133.70 marks in IBIS trade. The share had ended floor trade at 134.80 marks, down 1.40 marks.</p>
