<p>LIFFE cocoa futures ended on session highs on Tuesday, getting a late lift from buy-stops and New York's strength.</p>
<p>July closed up 11 stg at 1,013 stg per tonne, which was also the highest since June 4. September gained nine to 1,031.</p>
<p>Total volume stood at 6,146 contracts, with most of the activity seen in switches. Traders said September/December traded 500 times and July/September was active between 22 and 20 stg.</p>
<p>July was the busiest contract with 1,497 lots traded.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, traders said New York's firmer tone helped prices. A flurry of market-on-close buy orders were triggered as New York looked poised to move up after London closed.</p>
<p>But gains were limited due to light, scaled-up trade selling, they said.</p>
<p>After strong closes on Monday and Tuesday, some traders expected more near-term gains for cocoa.</p>
<p>But some technical analysts warned that stiff resistance was nearby. In September, strong resistance was pegged just above the day's close of 1,031.</p>
<p>Traders said they were keeping an eye on the hefty 16,000 lots of July open interest in New York before first notice day there on June 17. A sudden long liquidation or rollover of speculators' long positions could pressure prices.</p>
<p>News that Ivorian cocoa arrivals totalled about 1.02 to 1.03 million tonnes by May 12, down from 1.11 million by that date last year, had little impact on prices, traders said.</p>
<p>They said the arrivals were within expectations.</p>
<p>News that Amsterdam cocoa imports dropped 20 percent in the first quarter from year-ago levels also did little to move prices.</p>
<p>In options, 60 options changed hands. Twenty July 975 puts, 20 July 1,000 calls and 20 December 1,100 calls traded.</p>
