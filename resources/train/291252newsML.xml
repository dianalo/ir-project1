<p>Oxis International Inc said Tuesday it has successfully completed a Phase I trial of BXT-51072, a drug to treat diseases associated with damage from free radicals and reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p>The trial tested the compound in a series of mimics of the natural antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement its plans to move forward with a Phase II trial of BXT-51072 in inflammatory bowel disease in 1997, pending regulatory review.  </p>
<p>The placebo-controlled, Phase I trials were conducted in the United Kingdom and evaluated the safety of single and multiple doses of BXT-51072 in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased with the results of the trials,&quot; said Chief Operating Officer Timothy Rodell, M.D.</p>
<p>&quot;The drug was well absorbed by the oral route and no significant safety issues were seen,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>BXT-51072 was designed to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which are toxic molecules produced as a result of normal metabolism and present in increased levels in certain inflammatory conditions.</p>
<p>The company said it believes the drug will be useful in treating several diseases.</p>
<p>OXIS is also developing a second series of lipid soluble antioxidant compounds for potential use in treating specific dermal and ophthalmic diseases, and pursuing a discovery phase program in the cancer area.</p>
