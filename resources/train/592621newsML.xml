<p>Embattled Prime Minister Alain Juppe won praise from a key ally on Friday who likened calls to sack him to demoting a victorious general if the centre-right coalition wins France's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>Francois Leotard, head of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) which is the junior partner in Juppe's coalition, said &quot;it is not unimaginable&quot; that Juppe could stay on despite polls showing that voters overwhelmingly want him out.</p>
<p>&quot;If we win it means that he will have led the coalition to victory. I don't see generals getting demoted when they win battles,&quot; he told RTL radio of the National Assembly election on May 25-June 1.</p>
<p>Leotard stopped short of saying he wanted President Jacques Chirac to reappoint Juppe if the coalition wins, saying the decision was up to Chirac alone.</p>
<p>Polls show about two-thirds of voters want Juppe out because unemployment has risen to a record 12.8 percent since he came to office in 1995 promising a war for jobs. He is also held responsible for weak economic growth and political corruption scandals.</p>
<p>Juppe has sought to play down his personality as a campaign issue and insists he is not actively seeking re-election. &quot;I'm not such a bad man,&quot; he said in an interview with the daily Le Parisien.</p>
<p>The daily France-Soir offered readers cut-out heads of various businessmen to stick on his shoulders after an opinion poll showed most French people would prefer a prime minister who was not a professional politician.</p>
