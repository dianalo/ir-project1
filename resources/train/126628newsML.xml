<p>Singapore gas oil traded on Friday at a new five-year high of $30.55 per barrel but traders said the level achieved was attributed neither to the rise in crude nor to strong fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good number to sell short,&quot; said a trader referring the sale of the 230,000 barrels of gas oil lifting November 2-6 on a free-on-board basis from Singapore by Shell to U.S. trader Cargill. Chinese demand seen earlier in the week, had been supportive. A deal was heard done Thursday at $235 per tonne on a cost-and-freight basis into South China for a cargo delivering at the end October. But Chinese buyers were quiet on Friday.  </p>
<p>Jet fuel was assessed on par with gas oil traders said. Firm north Asian buying has yet to emerge while supplies were healthy, they said. One major was heard offering at $30.55 per barrel for a jet A-1 cargo lifting November 2-6. An offer was also heard for 200,000 barrels at a 10 cent discount to Singapore quotes for November 10-15 lifting. But no bids were heard.</p>
<p>Naphtha firmed marginally with crude but trade was lacklustre ahead of Saudi Aramco term talks next week. Paper for November rose slightly to $22.50/22.70 from $22.40/22.70 on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Fuel oil prices hovered around $121-$123 per tonne for 180-cst supplies loading in November, defying crude's rises as North Asian supplies pressured the market. A distressed cargo loading from South Korea in October was sold earlier this week but two more October cargoes from South Korean and Japan still seek homes. Traders said prices may receive some support from Chinese buyers who have returned to seek November cargoes after their stocks were drawn down as imports slowed when prices started rose in early October. Bids for southern China deliveries were heard at $127 per tonne or at a $5-$6 per tonne premium over Singapore spot quotes on a cost-and-freight basis.</p>
