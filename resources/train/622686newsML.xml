<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>IMM currency futures finished mixed after increasingly thin, anxiety-ridden afternoon trading that magnified price swings.</p>
<p>Although most units, especially yen, eroded significantly after midday from the morning's peaks, brokers agreed the move occurred on scanty volume.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nobody in the pit,&quot; said one floor broker before the close. &quot;It wouldn't take a 100-lot to move it around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's been very quiet,&quot; said another broker. &quot;Maybe Monday, with (U.S.) personal income and consumption,&quot; volume will pick up.  </p>
<p>Brokers first must face Friday's report on revised first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product, expected to show 6.0 percent growth, up from the prior estimate of 5.6 percent.</p>
<p>The price index and implicit deflator are expected to remain unchanged at 2.7 percent and 2.3 percent.</p>
<p>Marks stayed on the defensive after Wednesday's airing of a dispute between the Bonn government and the Bundesbank over a Bonn plan to revalue gold reserves, a move that might help Germany meet European economic convergence criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;Marks are the 'Land of Confusion' these days,&quot; a third floor broker said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The bickering between the Bundesbank and government -- I think this political situation is screwing up a lot of people,&quot; added the third broker. &quot;A lot of people got hurt (Wednesday).&quot;</p>
<p>Yen pulled back during the afternoon from its morning peak, but traders said the downswing occurred on still-thin turnover and lacked muscle.</p>
<p>They said yen lost ground Thursday mainly due to perceptions that the Bank of Japan might not see leeway to raise rates after an unexpectedly weak April Japanese industrial output report.  </p>
<p>Mark futures quickly brushed the day's low when German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said revaluation of the gold reserves was necessary despite the Buba's objections.</p>
<p>Swiss francs hit their highs and dragged other units upward as well late in the morning when the Swiss National Bank left its discount rate unchanged at 1.0 percent. Some forecasters had expected the Swiss to ease credit again.</p>
<p>June yen lost $0.000047 at $0.008615, marks off $0.0002 at $0.5898, Swiss fr firmed $0.0002 to $0.7099, sterling eased $0.0002 to $1.6386, Can dollar rose $0.0017 to $0.7255, Aussie added $0.0007 to $0.7653, M peso up $0.000100 at $0.125650.
