<p>Singapore government securities ended narrowly mixed in moderate trade on interbank and retail interest, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Government securities were narrowly mixed amid uncertainty over the near-term direction of the market. Treasury bill yields were steady to slightly lower but bond prices were steady to slightly higher. Volume was moderate,&quot; a local dealer said.</p>
<p>In treasury bills, three-months closed at a yield of 1.55/1.50 percent compared with Tuesday's yield of 1.58/1.53 percent but one-year was unchanged from Tuesday's yield of 1.68/1.63 percent.  </p>
<p>Among bonds, April 1999 was unchanged from Tuesday's close of S$99.53/99.58.</p>
<p>September 2001 ended at S$96.75/96.80 against Tuesday's S$96.70/96.75 and June 2003 at S$94.78/94.83 versus S$94.75/94.80.</p>
