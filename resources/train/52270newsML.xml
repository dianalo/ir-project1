<title>UK: LCE white sugar slides on Oct expiry, NY options.</title>
<headline>LCE white sugar slides on Oct expiry, NY options.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-13</dateline>

<p>White sugar futures added to their earlier weakness after the New York opening on Friday as the spot October contract tumbled in the little time remaining before expiry, traders said.</p>
<p>October slid over $8 to a session low of $338.00, producing a contango on the nearby spread which then bounced back as the second-month December contract firmed slightly off its same-value low.</p>
<p>Traders said the sudden weakness in the New York market, where October options are set to expire, had pushed the London market to even lower levels in the afternoon. &quot;It's basis the weakness in October and the weakness in New York which is pulling it down,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>At 1601 GMT the October whites contract was still at $338.00, down $8.30 on the day. December was down $3.90 at $339.00 and most other positions were some $3.00 weaker.</p>
<p>Volume totalled 2,194 lots.</p>
<p>Market sources said they expected only a couple of cargoes to be delivered against October, with Poland and possibly south Brazil as origins.</p>
<p>&quot;The days of the squeeze look like they're over for the time being,&quot; the trader said, adding that the March contract was attracting the same amount of rolling October interest as second-month December.</p>
<p>&quot;December is a quiet month on the whites so if people are rolling you'll probably get a fair share of that into March,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Paris positions were also weaker ahead of the Matif October expiry in a volume of 1,913 lots.</p>
<p>October was down $2.00 at $341.00 and December down $4.00 at $338.50.</p>
