<title>UKRAINE: Turkmen gas supplies to Ukraine down by a third.</title>
<headline>Turkmen gas supplies to Ukraine down by a third.</headline>
<dateline>KIEV 1997-07-01</dateline>

<p>Turkmen gas supplies to Ukraine have been cut by a third in the last two weeks and Kiev is falling behind with supplies for winter, a spokesman for a Ukrainian state gas company said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been getting 30 million cubic metres (per day) of Turkmen gas for the last two weeks instead of a planned 44 million cubic metres,&quot; Volodymyr Maxymiv, a senior advisor at Ukrgazprom, said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not need too much gas for domestic consumption before the second half of October, but the dangerous thing is that we are behind schedule in storing gas ahead of the winter,&quot; Maxymiv said. &quot;Traders don't care about tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>He said gas supplies in summer were usually increased by 35 percent to prepare for winter but he declined to say how much gas Ukraine had already put by.</p>
<p>Ukraine was due to import about 13 billion cubic metres of Turkmen gas this year in addition to 53 bcm of Russian and five bcm of Uzbek gas. Annual domestic output stands at 18 bcm.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian government owes Turkmenistan $780 million for gas supplied in 1993-1995. Separately, Itera-Ukraine corporation, a U.S.-Russia-Ukraine joint venture, has yet to pay $320 million for supplies from 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan quit trading with Ukraine through Itera about two months because of payment problems. Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma cancelled a visit to Turkmenistan in May over disagreements surrounding unpaid gas debts.</p>
<p>Last week Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov signed a decree disbanding the Turkmen-Russian joint venture Turkmenrosgaz, which transported Turkmen natural gas via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to other markets including Ukraine.</p>
<p>Turkmen gas is now sent to Ukraine via Russia and is co-ordinated by Russian gas group Gazprom and Ukraine's state-owned Ukrgaz, which was appointed on a temporary basis to replace Itera.</p>
<p>Kuchma and Niyazov have said that in principle gas should flow to Ukraine without intermediaries.</p>
