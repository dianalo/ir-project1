<title>USA: Cost of laughing rises 3 percent - index.</title>
<headline>Cost of laughing rises 3 percent - index.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hold on to your hats, jokesters. It's 3 percent more expensive to get a yuk this year.</p>
<p>It's no laughing matter, said attorney-turned-humour consultant Malcolm Kushner, who developed the Cost of Laughing Index.</p>
<p>&quot;It means we're paying more net worth for less net mirth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The index, released Thursday, is a compilation of 16 leading humour indicators, including the cost of admission to comedy clubs in 10 cities, wholesale prices for rubber chickens and other gags and the price of an issue of Mad magazine.</p>
<p>The biggest increase, accounting for almost all of the overall rise, came from higher fees for writing a half-hour television sitcom, which have risen to $11,545 from $11,209 last year. The fees are based on the minimum established under the Writers Guild of America contract agreement.</p>
<p>Luckily for many fun-seekers, prices for an arrow-through-the-head remained steady, $6 a dozen, as did Groucho glasses ($15 a dozen) and rubber chickens ($66 a dozen).</p>
<p>Lucky, too, are toastmasters all. The cost of a singing telegram featuring a pink gorilla ($75) or dancing chicken ($65) also held steady from last year's level.</p>
<p>The only comedy club among the 10 in the index to raise prices was Chicago's Second City, charging $16 this year, up from $15.50 last year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, said Kushner, of Santa Cruz, Calif., the higher fees charged by TV sitcom writers isn't adding up to more laughs for viewers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hollywood execs laugh all the way to the bank while TV viewers wait for a few chuckles. It's the tickle down theory of economics.&quot;</p>
