<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan Tuesday defended his recent cautionary remarks about the steep run-up in the U.S. stock market and denied that he was trying to push stock prices lower.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not what I was intending to do,&quot; the central bank chief told the House Budget Committee. &quot;What I was trying to do ...  was to try to lay out all of the various factors which we examine for purposes of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Greenspan rattled financial markets first in December, then again last week after he suggested that stock prices might have risen too far because of investors' &quot;irrational exuberance.&quot;</p>
<p>In his Congressional testimony on Tuesday, the Fed Chairman also said it was &quot;crucial&quot; to keep inflation down in the near term and made clear that the central bank was ready to raise interest rates if needed to achieve that.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that the most likely prospect is for continued sustainable economic growth accompanied by low and stable inflation, and our objective will be to foster the conditions most likely to produce that outcome,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
<p>Much of his testimony dwelt on the imperfections of the consumer price index as a measurement of inflation and how to fix it.</p>
<p>But the fireworks came in pointed questioning by Republican Representative Jim Bunning about the stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;Why have you on two occasions taken to jawboning the U.S. stock market and the U.S. bond market with your comments?&quot; the Kentucky lawmaker asked Greenspan.</p>
<p>Greenspan argued that no one, not even himself, can fundamentally affect the direction of financial markets by jawboning, although he acknowledged that his comments can have a temporary impact on prices.</p>
<p>&quot;These are very thick, elaborate, international markets which are driven by decisions of millions of people,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody can affect them in a fundamental way.&quot;</p>
<p>Since Greenspan warned last Wednesday that stock prices might be too high, the Dow Jones industrial average of blue chip shares has lost more than 100 points, or close to 2 percent.</p>
<p>The Fed chief has come in for some sharp criticism for his comments from investors and analysts who have accused him of meddling in a market in which he has no business doing so.</p>
<p>&quot;With all due respect, would Alan Greenspan please shut up?&quot; columnist James Glassman wrote in the Washington Post newspaper on Tuesday. &quot;He thinks stocks are too high. But so what? His guess on the 'proper' level of the stock market is no better than anyone else's.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan argued that he was not out of place in commenting on the stock market because it has an impact on the Fed's interest rate policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is incumbent on us to explain what it is we are doing and why we are doing it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>That way the markets are not caught completely by surprise when the central bank elects to change interest rates, he said.</p>
<p>The Fed is concerned about the run-up in stock prices, Greenspan made clear last week, because it could be a harbinger of faster inflation ahead and could damage the economy if it abruptly reversed.</p>
<p>Greenspan did give the thumbs-up to the recent shift in some household savings away from bank deposits into equity mutual funds and other investments.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a normal and desirable expansion of the structure of household balance sheets as the standrad of living progressively rises,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Greenspan told the lawmakers that investors remain somewhat sceptical about the ability of Congress and the Clinton administration to strike a deal that convincingly tackles the federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;If you get a credible budget ... I think the markets would respond quite positively,&quot; he said, adding that the drop in long-term interest rates as result could be &quot;signficant.&quot;</p>
<p>As he has done before, Greenspan argued that the consumer price index (CPI) significantly overstates inflation, effectively costing the government billions of dollars each year in Social Security and other benefit payments.</p>
<p>He renewed his call for establishment of an independent national commission to set annual cost-of-living increases for federal taxes and spending programmes, instead of using the CPI.</p>
<p>That would save the government money and make it easier to balance the budget.</p>
