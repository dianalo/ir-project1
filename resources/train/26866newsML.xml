<headline>GEC says amends Simpson's pay package.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>British defence and engineering group General Electric Company (GEC) said on Monday it has amended the terms of new managing director George Simpson's remuneration package.  </p>
<p>GEC's share price must now exceed by at least 10 percent the growth in the FTSE 100 index over a three year period for Simpson to receive a huge block of shares, instead of the six months as previously agreed, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;GEC and Mr Simpson have always envisaged that challenging performance criteria would be attached to awards made to Mr Simpson under the GEC employee share plan,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;GEC is pleased to confirm that the criteria will comply with Association of British Insurers' current guidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources said earlier the company had proposed draft changes after meeting the ABI's investment affairs head Richard Regan.  </p>
<p>Simpson has accepted the amendment to his contract.</p>
<p>The meeting with the ABI had been called after shareholders expressed concern over the terms of Simpson's proposed 10 million stg pay package.</p>
<p>His three year contract includes annual pay of up to 1.5 million stg, including pension contributions and share options.</p>
<p>Investors Norwich Union and Prudential Corp were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Last week, mutually-owned insurer Norwich Union said it had not discarded the possibility of voting against Simpson's appointment at the company's annual meeting on September 6.</p>
