<p>Hua Nan, one of Taiwan's &quot;Big Three&quot; state-run banks, said on Friday it was raising its prime lending rate by 0.125 percentage point to 7.65 percent, effective Saturday.  </p>
<p>The bank also was raising its one-month-to-three-year time deposits rates by between 0.05 and 0.20 percentage point.</p>
<p>The bank was taking cue from the First Commercial Bank, another &quot;Big Three&quot; bank, which raised its interest rates on Friday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Taiwan and Cooperative Bank of Taiwan raised their rates on Thursday. Various private commercial banks also raised rates recently.</p>
<p>The rate hikes came one week after the central bank's decision to increase two key interest rates to stabilise the foreign exchange market.  </p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong said on July 31 the bank was raising the rediscount rate and accommodations against secured loans to 5.25 and 5.625 percent, respectively, effective August 1.</p>
