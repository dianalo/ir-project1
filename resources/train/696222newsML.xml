<p>The dollar nudged higher in U.S. trading on Monday, benefitting from a series of strong economic reports and ongoing concerns about the strength of Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>After surging to a 40-month high of 1.7465 marks in early European trade, the dollar settled into a relatively narrow, though well-supported, range during the U.S. session.</p>
<p>It ended just below its peak at 1.7450/60 marks against 1.7438/43 at the open, and edged up to 114.58/68 yen from 114.33/43 at the outset of trading.</p>
<p>&quot;The convergence of a number of factors seem to be propelling the dollar higher, particularly against the European currencies,&quot; said Bob Savage, chief dealer at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;The feeling is that we're going to have a broad and weak euro and that the U.S. economy is going to continue to outperform.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said that sustainable budgetary discipline was a more important goal than meeting the the strict fiscal criteria designed to ensure a strong euro.</p>
<p>And on Monday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl downplayed a rift with his party's ruling coalition partners over monetary union and vowed that his government was fully united in its drive to launch the single currency on time.</p>
<p>The remarks convinced the market of Germany's resolve in pushing ahead with the single currency project regardless of its ability to meet the economic requirements for its launch.</p>
<p>The dollar was also buoyed on Monday by a series of strong U.S. economic reports which suggested that growth could be picking up again after several months of slowing.</p>
<p>New single family home sales rose a sharper-than-expected 7.1 percent to 825,000 annualized units in May. Meanwhile, the Chicago and New York manufacturing indexes posted strong gains for the month of June, suggesting that Tuesday's National Association of Purchasing Management survey will also show strength.</p>
<p>Economists are not anticipating an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve following their two day meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, but traders said Monday's numbers kept hopes for an August rate rise alive.</p>
<p>&quot;We have economic numbers which seem to imply that the second quarter is now waking up,&quot; said Hillel Waxman, chief dealer at Bank Leumi Trust Co of New York. &quot;Nobody expects anything this week from the Fed but the possibility of an interest rate hike in August is there.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar's strong performance against the mark was mirrored by sterling, which rose to its top level against the German currency in almost five years.</p>
<p>The mark's euro woes and strong UK consumer credit data, which fuelled hopes for higher British interest rates, were behind sterling's strong performance on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said that a mini-budget, due this week from UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, was not expected to contain sufficient fiscal tightening to ward off higher rates.</p>
<p>They predicted subdued trading leading up to Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee decision and Thursday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.</p>
<p>In other trade on Monday, the dollar rose to 1.4615/25 Swiss francs from an opening rate of 1.4595/00 and pushed up to Canadian $1.3806/11 from C$1.3782/87.</p>
<p>The British pound ended weaker at $1.6640/50 versus $1.6648/58, while the Australian dollar rose to $0.7535/40 from $0.7456/61.</p>
