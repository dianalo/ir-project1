<p>Banco de Mexico said on Tuesday its net international assets as of Feburary 14 were $8.932 billion compared to $8.780 billion on February 7.</p>
<p>The central bank said that its net international reserves as of February 14 were $18.483 billion compared to $18.809 billion as of February 7.  </p>
<p>The central bank said the increase of $152 million in net international assets in the same time period was due to:</p>
<p>--Net income from operations by the state oil company Pemex worth $376 million.</p>
<p>-- Purchase of $138 million from credit institutions from the January 31 dollar put auction.</p>
<p>--Net sales of foreign currency to the federal government worth $187 million.</p>
<p>--Interest payments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) worth $143 million.</p>
<p>--A let loss of $32 million dollars for a combination of factors including changes in the dollar value of non-dollar assets and liabilities held by the bank; net returns on interest rates and from trading of metals and securities; and net deposits in dollar accounts from commercial banks at the central bank.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico said that between February 7 and February 14 the monetary base rose by 1.092 billion pesos due to an increase in the seasonal demand of bills and coins attributed to the payment of salaries.</p>
<p>In the same period, net deposits of the federal government with the central bank fell by 9.106 billion pesos, mainly as a reuslt of the transfer of payments by the Treasury to federal entities.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico said it neutralized the increase in liquidity resulting from the decrease of net deposits with the federal government by taking in deposits from financial institutions totalling 9.213 billion pesos.</p>
