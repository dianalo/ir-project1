<headline>TV Azteca to block NBC's rights for stake - WSJ.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's Television Azteca SA intends to try and prevent General Electric Co unit NBC from exercising its rights to take as much as a 10 percent stake in it, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to TV Azteca director Pedro Padilla, NBC failed to meet many conditions contained in a joint-venture contract both networks signed three years ago, the newspaper said in its electronic editions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been decieved. They haven't given us anything and we will sue them,&quot; Padilla was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>NBC spokesman George Jamison was quoted in the Journal as saying NBC was notified late on Tuesday a lawsuit had been filed and said the matter would be arbitrated at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.</p>
<p>Jamison was quoted as saying NBC's name, logo, reputation and programming were among factors contributing to TV Azteca's success.</p>
<p>TV Azteca was privatized in 1993 and teamed up with NBC in May 1994 to secure programming, the Journal said. In return, NBC received warrants to buy as much as 10 percent of the Mexican broadcaster, the paper said.</p>
