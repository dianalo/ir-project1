<p>Market analysts in Thailand welcomed small lending rate cuts by three leading Thai banks on Monday but said deeper reductions were needed to stimulate the nation's sagging economy.</p>
<p>The cuts, which came after latest signals for lower rates given by the Bank of Thailand governor, would alleviate debt burdens of many cash-strapped businesses, the analysts told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Thailand's lending rate is one of the highest in the region... Any rate cut is good for those in business especially (property) developers with high debt obligations,&quot; said Philip Finch, the research manager at property consultant Richard Ellis.</p>
<p>&quot;But to stimulate domestic demand, the cut would have to be in the single digits. We don't expect that to happen in the near future,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond said earlier on Monday that he expected more commercial banks to cut their rates in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Soon after the governor's statement, his second on rates since Friday, leading Thai banks, Krung Thai Bank and Siam Commercial Bank, announced 25-basis-point cuts in their minimum lending rates, effective from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Later in the day, Thai Farmers Bank followed suit with the same cut, also effective Tuesday.</p>
<p>The new minimum lending rate (MLR) at Krung Thai Bank will be 12.75 percent and 13.00 percent at Siam Commercial and Thai Farmers, bank officials said.</p>
<p>The central bank governor had said the interest rate might be cut by 25 basis points initially and would ease further, but he declined to say what he deemed appropriate interest rate levels.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on the market mechanism and the economic situation,&quot; Rerngchai said.</p>
<p>Thailand's lending rates are among the highest in the region, ranging between 13.0 and 13.25 percent.</p>
<p>The high rates have forced many businesses and especially the property sector into difficulties making many cash-strapped developers unable to repay loans, analysts said.</p>
<p>The finance sector in turn has run into turmoil, hit by billions of dollars in bad loans, and been ordered by the authorities to restructure to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Thailand's central bank pursued a tight monetary policy to defend the baht against speculative attacks, curb spending to narrow the current account deficit and attract foreign funds to finance the deficit.</p>
<p>The policy has achieved a more stabilised external balance position but has in the process stifled economic growth which some analysts believe could fall below the officially projected 6.8 percent target for this year.</p>
<p>Bank of America country treasurer N. Rajugopalan called for more rate cuts to revive the econmy.</p>
<p>&quot;The cut of 25 basis points we have seen so far is okay but we need more cuts to jump-start the economy... A few more cuts between now and the end of the year will probably help revive the slow economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But any sharp drop in rates was unlikely, said Arporn Chewakrenkai, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Arporn said the risks for the fragile baht were not over and any sharp rate cuts could induce speculative attacks on the baht and result in outflows of much-needed foreign funds.</p>
<p>&quot;But overall, any cut is welcome to boost the economy, although 25 basis points will not be enough to eliminate the risk of recession. About 150-200 might be,&quot; Arporn said.</p>
<p>The baht took the small rate cut in stride and was unaffected by the news. It was quoted in a narrow high-low range of 26.115-26.133 to the dollar against a central mid-rate of 26.11.</p>
