<headline>Grace unit CEO sees '98 divestiture.</headline>
<dateline>BOCA RATON, Fla. 1997-02-11</dateline>

<p>The head of W.R. Grace &amp; Co unit Cross Country Staffing said on Tuesday that the temporary-help business was likely to be sold or spun off to the public next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no delusion we are part of Grace's long-term strategy,&quot; Cross Country chief executive Joseph Boshart said during a meeting with reporters.  </p>
<p>Packaging and specialty chemicals group Grace owns just over 60 percent of Cross Country, in partnership with Nestor-BNA Plc of Britain, and has been selling and spinning off businesses in a continuing restructuring.  Grace last year rejected a merger offer from Hercules Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;I would anticipate that sometime in 1998 there will be liquidation,&quot; Boshart said.</p>
<p>A downturn in the U.S. stock market or a recession might upset that time table, he said.  </p>
<p>Other staffing groups such as temporary-help giant Olsten might be strategic buyers of Cross Country, a specialist in placing nurses for short-term assignments, the executive said. Boshart said he had no contact with any potential buyers.</p>
<p>&quot;We would prefer to remain independent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Boshart said Cross Country, a $124 million-a-year unit which supplies nurses and other temporary health workers to hospitals across the United States, was performing well, had achieved dominance in its $300 million-a-year sector, and was now looking for growth outside its mainstay healthcare-worker businesses.</p>
<p>Cross Country is starting an information-technology unit designed to supply software engineers, programmers and other computer specialists to healthcare organizations needing temporary help.  Jonathan Ward, head of the new unit, said healthcare organizations spend about $1 billion a year on information technology workers and Cross Country hoped to have $5 million of that business by year end.</p>
