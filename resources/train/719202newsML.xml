<headline>HK Democrats pack up, unelected lawmakers move in.</headline>

<p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians, ousted from the legislature when China took over on July 1, left their offices on Thursday to make way for members of the post-handover assembly appointed by Beijing.</p>
<p>The new Provisional Legislature, meanwhile, rubber-stamped a bill allowing illegal child immigrants to be sent back to the mainland -- prompting a potential legal challenge to the move.</p>
<p>The bill could mean the repatriation of hundreds of children smuggled in to join parents with residency rights in the former British colony, now a quasi-autonomous region of China.</p>
<p>The new law, passed on Wednesday night, whipped up a storm of controversy after post-colonial leader Tung Chee-hwa asked the assembly to ram it through in a single sitting.</p>
<p>More than 30 mainland-born children were seeking legal aid to mount a court challenge to the legality of their deportation and would hear by the weekend whether their applications were successful, government radio said.</p>
<p>Law professor Nihal Jayawickrama said the bill violated Hong Kong's post-handover constitution, which gives children the legal right to join parents who are permanent residents.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happening here is that the fundamental law of Hong Kong, the Basic Law, is being infringed upon right from the beginning,&quot; Jayawickrama said.</p>
<p>Martin Lee, leader of the largest party in the dissolved colonial chamber, was on hand to see aides finish packing their belongings into cardboard boxes ahead of the deadline to quit.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a sad occasion,&quot; said Lee, as his Democratic Party staff bade farewell to the offices in Central district that belong to the government.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything's being moved out, but not because we've lost an election,&quot; said Lee. &quot;We won the last election to the Legislative Council in September 1995 for a four-year term.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Beijing reasserted control over Hong Kong at midnight on June 30, it disbanded the elected assembly and replaced it with a chamber made up of its own appointees.</p>
<p>Western nations and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong condemned the move, but in vain.</p>
<p>Lee said it was a &quot;joke&quot; that the Democrats and their allies were not sitting in the new Provisional Legislature, while candidates they defeated in the 1995 polls sat in their place.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy figures denounced the haste with which the interim assembly had passed the immigration bill, saying that it was already acting as a China-style rubber-stamp parliament.</p>
<p>Lee's deputy, Yeung Sum, said the new chief executive must be pleased with the workings of the new legislature.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that will make Mr Tung a very happy man because he will be pretty sure that whatever he tables will be passed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tung will visit Beijing on Friday for the swansong of the committee that laid the groundwork for the territory's government under Chinese rule.</p>
<p>&quot;He's going up there as a deputy director of the committee and to wind it up because this is the last session,&quot; a Tung spokesman said.</p>
<p>China's parliament last week approved the scrapping of the Preparatory Committee, a 150-member body of Chinese communist officials and Hong Kong notables created to pave the way for the transition to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>The committee, which chose a 400-member caucus that picked Tung as chief executive and appointed the Provisional Legislature last December, is due to announce its demise at the final session on Friday.</p>
