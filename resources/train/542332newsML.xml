<title>BANGLADESH: Bangladesh to cut short red tape for investors.</title>

<p>The head of Bangladesh's Board of Investment (BOI), Anisul Haque Chowdhury, said on Sunday that the government was trying to remove procedural tangles which irritate foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to detect unnecessary procedural hassles (the investors face) and attack them immediately,&quot; Chowdhury told a meeting with representatives of foreign companies doing business in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The BOI executive chairman said a special immigration desk would soon be set up at Dhaka airport to ensure faster immigration formalities for propspective investors from abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Our (diplomatic) missions abroad have been asked for quicker disposal of visa applications by investors. We are really trying to make things easier for the foreign investors,&quot; he told the members of the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).</p>
<p>Chowdhury said bureacracy was still a formidable impediment for investments in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&quot;I must say there is now a strong political will for a pro-investment climate. Politicians are well disposed of... but the problem lies with the bureaucracy, specially at the mid- and low- level of bureacracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Chowdhury said corruption was stalking the bureaucracy, and he blamed a &quot;poor&quot; compensation package for for the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's ridiculously low amount. Although I am not supporting corruption, many simply cannot remain honest with such a small salary&quot;.</p>
<p>He warned that poor compensation was making government jobs unattractive to intelligent graduates.</p>
<p>&quot;Bad time awaits the government machinery. Intelligent boys are not coming into the service. Efficiency of the bureaucracy is falling fast,&quot; Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>The BOI chief said power shortage in the industries would ease in the coming year with the additional generation of 600 megwatt of electricity.</p>
<p>&quot;Power is a dark part in our investment front. But that will ease by next one year.&quot;</p>
<p>FICCI President Mahbub Jamil demanded that the government must take step for ratification of the act relating to the protection of foreign investment by parliament to reassure the potential foreign investors.</p>
