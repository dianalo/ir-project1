<p>Etienne Davignon, chairman of the board of Belgian holding company Societe Generale de Belgique SA (SGB) , said that his debt-laden group has no need of a cash injection from its cash-rich French parent Compagnie de Suez .</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason to transfer cash. Overall the Suez-SGB group is in a good situation, is does not matter so much where the plusses and the minusses are located,&quot; Davignon told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>Davignon said that SGB has some 32 billion francs worth of debt, following the purchase of an extra 25 percent stake in its unit Tractebel last year. Most of SGB's debt has maturities of three to seven years.</p>
<p>Suez -- which owns 62 percent of SGB -- on the other hand sits on pile of cash worth about 30 billion Belgian francs, following a large divestment program in the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not matter where the cash is. It only matters in relation to what you want to do in the future,&quot; Davignon said.</p>
<p>Davignon said that SGB's debt was no burden on management, and that the situation was very different from the early nineties, when a similar debt burden forced SGB to offload several key holdings.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly, interest rates are much lower now than they were then; secondly, at that time our debt was against low-performing assets, which is not the case now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that the dividend yield on SGB's Tractebel shares is higher than their financing cost.</p>
<p>SGB bought 25 percent of Tractebel from Belgian holding company Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBL) in September, boosting its Tractebel stake to 65 percent.</p>
<p>Davignon said that for SGB it was &quot;technically possible&quot; to consider offering an optional stock dividend to shareholders, instead of paying out part of 1996 earnings in cash.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that a stock dividend would be a way of keeping cash in SGB, rather than moving it to Suez.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now in the situation that we can look at the possibility of an optional stock dividend. If Suez too had heavy debts, we obviously could not consider a stock dividend,&quot; Davignon said.</p>
<p>He stressed a stock dividend had not been formally studied and that no decision had been made yet.</p>
