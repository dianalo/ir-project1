<p>Indonesian President Suharto, accompanied by an 11-member delegation, arrived in Rangoon on Friday for a three-day visit to cement ties with Burma.</p>
<p>The Indonesian leader flew in to a red carpet welcome and was warmly greeted by Burmese Prime Minister Senior General Than Shwe and other senior military officials. A 21-gun salute was fired in his honour.</p>
<p>Suharto was driven in a motorcade to the State Guest House where he was scheduled to meet other top leaders of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).</p>
<p>A state banquet was planned in Suharto's honour later on Friday.</p>
<p>Suharto arrived from Vientiane on the last leg of a tour to Cambodia, Laos and Burma. He was last in Burma in 1974, embassy officials said.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, travelling with Suharto, was expected by diplomats to discuss Burma's prospective entry into the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei. The group will be enlarged to 10 members when Burma, Cambodia and Laos are admitted to it.</p>
<p>International pressure has mounted on ASEAN not to admit Burma on the grounds the ruling military junta is suppressing democracy.</p>
<p>Opposition leader Aung San Su Kyi, whose National League for Democracy Party says it is being harassed by the Burmese government, has also urged ASEAN not to invest in Burma and to refrain from constructive engagement with Rangoon until the SLORC's human rights record improves.</p>
<p>But ASEAN leaders have agreed Burma and the two other countries will be admitted, although a specific date for membership has not been set.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Rangoon said the Suharto visit was an opportunity for Rangoon to try and further Burma's chances of being accepted as an ASEAN member later this year.</p>
<p>Official figures showed that Indonesian investment in Burma jumped to $209 million at the end of January, mainly in the construction and manufacturing fields, compared with $21 million three months earlier.</p>
