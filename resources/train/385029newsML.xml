<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle bids Tuesday were at $64.00, steady with trade late last week, but owners rejected them, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Most cattle were priced at $65.00 with some at $66.00. Little trade was expected Tuesday. Packers were, however, reported to be picking up last week's purchases quickly and may need to buy more as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>Higher than expected January placements in Friday's USDA cattle report had little impact, with the market focused on short-term factors. &quot;The upfront cattle supply is really pretty tight,&quot; one Kansas feedlot manager said.  </p>
<p>They noted that aggressive cattle marketings recently had reduced average weights of cattle sold by about 15 to 20 lbs while the outlook was also aided by the usual late February pickup in meat demand which has given a firm tone to beef prices.</p>
<p>USDA estimated the average slaughter cattle weight for the week ended Saturday at 1,163 lbs, slightly down from the previous week's estimate of 1,164 lbs and still well behind the year ago actual weight of 1,177 lbs.</p>
<p>Many feedlots were reportedly extremely current following last week's heavy sales volume, they said.</p>
<p>Beef prices, as of 1130 CST Tuesday, were quoted up $0.03 to $1.02 per cwt, with 175 fabricated loads sold, USDA said.</p>
