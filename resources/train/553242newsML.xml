<p>Hopes grew that a Northern Ireland prison protest might be defused on Thursday after pro-British politicians said they had held positive talks with officials.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a constructive meeting,&quot; Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) told reporters after discussions aimed at ending a three-day dispute involving convicted Protestant &quot;Loyalist&quot; inmates at the Maze Prison near Belfast.</p>
<p>McMichael, whose group has political links with the banned Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), denied media reports that hoax bomb alerts that caused traffic chaos earlier in Belfast were the work of supporters of the prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing to suggest that it was tied to this dispute,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The UDP leader said he was on his way to discuss the result of the talks with inmates who are objecting to the tightening of security measures as a result of a foiled tunnel escape last month by Irish Republican Army prisoners.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some positive developments and as a result of that we are on our way now to speak to the UDA and UFF prisoners in the Maze. Whether the issue can be resolved is a sensitive issue at this time. We have to wait and see how things develop,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>UDA and UFF prisoners tried to burn down two watchtowers and staged rooftop protests earlier this week. Staff were withdrawn from two wings for their own protection.</p>
<p>The Protestants, called Loyalist because of an unyielding allegiance to British rule, say they are being unfairly punished for IRA wrong-doing.</p>
<p>The Loyalists are serving long jail terms for crimes they said were aimed at thwarting an IRA onslaught designed to end British rule in Northern Ireland.</p>
