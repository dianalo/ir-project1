<p>The Thai government was told on Sunday that the biggest problem facing the country's hard-hit exports was none other than the Thai government itself.</p>
<p>At a meeting of government policy makers and exporters in this resort town, business leaders put the blame squarely on the government for the sharp slowdown in Thai exports.</p>
<p>They hit out at authorities for their failure to cut high interest rates, red tape, corruption in the Customs Department and for a lack of a focused export strategy.</p>
<p>Present at the meeting, dubbed the Export Summit, were Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee and Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan.</p>
<p>Thailand's exports contracted 0.2 percent in 1996 compared with 23.6 percent growth in 1995. The Bank of Thailand has set the export growth target for 1997 at 7.7 percent and the commerce ministry has put it at 10 percent.</p>
<p>Export growth during the first quarter of this year was estimated by the commerce ministry at 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>Sluggish exports have added to Thailand's economic woes. Private economists see gross domestic product growth at a decade-low of about six percent, while interest rates, at 12.75-13.0 percent, are among the highest in the region and have stifled many businesses.</p>
<p>Vichien Techapaiboon, head of the Board of Trade, told reporters that high production costs, caused by high interest rates, and other unnecessary expenses had made Thai products less competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;It would help if interest rates come down by about 200 basis points this year. The government also has to solve bureaucracy problems, especially in the customs department,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Critics of the customs department say it is riddled with corruption. Moreover, its export procedures are complicated and normally entail extra expense for exporters.</p>
<p>Some exporters said they had to resort to private brokers to deal with the department to avoid complications.</p>
<p>Thai products incorporating higher technologies account for about half of the country's total exports. Exports from this sector grew around 10 percent year-on-year during the first four months of 1997, according to private sector estimates.</p>
<p>Exports of primary commodities, which represent 15 percent of total exports, contracted 10 percent while sales from labour-intensive industries such as textile and footwear contracted three percent in the same period.</p>
<p>Analysts said Thai exports were undergoing structural as well as cyclical problems. Production of higher-end products had yet to reach full capacity, while output in the labour-intensive sector was hit by tough competition from lower-cost producers.</p>
<p>Olarn Chaiprawat, president of the Thai Bankers' Association, said the government lacked focus in its strategies to deal with the slowdown in exports.</p>
<p>&quot;One has to look at problems and potential in each export group. You cannot use a blanket solution to deal with problems in commodities exports the way you deal with electronics,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Tax, interest rates or the baht's value are not a cure-all. The government should encourage the private sector to improve its productivity by upgrading its human resources and management,&quot; Olarn added.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, companies in less competitive labour-intensive industries should be able to have access to cheap and long-term funds only if they show concrete plans to improve productivity and efficiency,&quot; he added.</p>
