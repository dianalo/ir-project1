<p>Nominations for Oman's consultative Shura Council, which will include women for the first time, will be held in mid-October, an interior ministry undersecretary said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Qahtan bin Ya'rub al-Bousaidi, quoted by the official Oman News Agency, said nominations for the body's 80 members would take place &quot;on a single day in the middle of October throughout Oman's 59 provinces&quot;.</p>
<p>Sultan Qaboos in June issued a landmark decree allowing women across the country to stand for election to the council, a consultative body seen as an important sounding board for public opinion.</p>
<p>The sultan's directive also enabled women to nominate candidates for the council. After the nominations, Sultan Qaboos has the final say in picking the 80 candidates.</p>
<p>During Oman's last Shura Council elections in 1994, the government granted women living in the capital Muscat the right to stand for election and make nominations, but their participation was limited to the capital's six provinces.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented move in conservative Gulf Arab states, Sultan Qaboos appointed two of the nominated women to the council in November 1994.</p>
<p>Oman, a small independent oil producer, announced the creation of the Shura Council in 1991. The body studies legislation and is intended to widen representation in the government.</p>
<p>Some other Gulf states have similar consultative bodies and Kuwait has a parliament, but they do not include women.</p>
