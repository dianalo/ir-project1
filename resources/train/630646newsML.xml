<headline>Malaysian ministers quizzed on missing rubber fund.</headline>

<p>Malaysia's Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has asked two cabinet ministers to explain the alleged misappropriation of 600 million ringgit ($238 million) in rubber industry funds, the Bernama news agency reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa and Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik have been asked to submit their case at the weekly meeting of the Malaysian cabinet on Wednesday, Anwar was quoted as saying by Bernama.</p>
<p>Government officials were not immediately available to comment on the report.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked Annuar to explain to the Cabinet on the matter...Keng Yaik can also use the Cabinet as a forum,&quot; said Anwar, who is also Finance Minister and chairman of the government committee against malpractices.</p>
<p>Anwar said a statement would be issued after the meeting.</p>
<p>Lim, who is responsible for Malaysia's commodities, said on Saturday that the money from the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA) went &quot;missing&quot; due to unprofitable investments and purchase of non-beneficial assets.</p>
<p>Without the funds, lower-end rubber growers could not apply for loans to replant rubber trees, said Lim.</p>
<p>Rural Development Minister Annuar, who is responsible for RISDA, said he was shocked by the allegations and had ordered an immediate inquiry into the matter.</p>
<p>He said his findings showed that the replanting fund in RISDA had only reached a maximum of 400 million ringgit since being set up in 1972, and not 600 million ringgit.</p>
<p>Annuar said although he could see &quot;no cause for alarm at all... however, it doesn't mean that RISDA officers can relax&quot;.</p>
