<p>Israel's strenuous rebuff of French offers to join the Middle East peace process will not prevent the European Union from pressing for a greater say in the region, diplomats and officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not just want to be the money box for the Middle East,&quot; said Josep Coll I Carbo, a spokesman for the European Commission. &quot;Our position is clear, we have the political will and mutual confidence to make a real contribution.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission -- the EU's executive -- has been closely involved in diplomatic efforts by the 15-nation bloc for a Middle East role more in keeping with what it considers to be its significant financial contribution.</p>
<p>Diplomats say the EU will step up pressure for involvement next week when the bloc's foreign ministers gather for a regular meeting in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Ireland -- which holds the current presidency of the EU -- is finalising proposals for ministers to consider appointing a special envoy to the region with a role similar to that enjoyed by EU representatives in Bosnia and Africa's Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>The last thing the EU wants is to appoint an envoy who would not be entertained by Israel, and that is a real fear given the reception accorded French President Jacques Chirac on Monday.</p>
<p>Chirac's weekend offer for France or Europe to mediate in the stalled peace process was brushed aside by Israeli officials and the press on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be very careful before I would add more cooks to the broth,&quot; said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &quot;I don't think at this time in such sensitive negotiations it would be wise to introduce another interlocutor.&quot;</p>
<p>Chirac -- who arrived in Jerusalem on Monday -- defended his weekend call for an EU peace role, saying: &quot;I did not come here to teach people lessons...I am simply saying that we are available and we have valid reasons to be involved.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;A certain balance of things may justify the presence of Europe and of France.&quot;</p>
<p>EU diplomats said on Monday that next week's Luxembourg meeting was not a question of whether to appoint an envoy, but rather who to appoint.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some debate as to whether the envoy should be a political figure or a diplomatic figure,&quot; said one EU official. &quot;The thinking at the moment is that it should be political.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats stressed that the EU was not looking actually to sit a representative at the same table as Israeli and Palestinian officials, but rather coordinate the disparate European interests in the region.</p>
<p>The EU has been the most prominent bankroller of development efforts in Palestinian-controlled areas of Gaza and the West Bank and, more significantly, is also discussing lucrative trade ties with Israel under the umbrella of its Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p>EU officials are reluctant to use the threat of cancelling Israel's participation as a lever into the peace process, but diplomats said one of the envoy's tasks &quot;would be to remind all the parties of our considerable assistance&quot;.</p>
<p>The presence of Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Luxembourg will not help assuage Israeli feelings that the EU is biased towards the Palestinians in its Middle East policy.</p>
<p>Moussa will be in Luxembourg for a so-called &quot;cooperation council&quot; a regular meeting during which EU foreign ministers review relations with trading partners. Israel and the Middle East peace process will figure large in that review, diplomats said.</p>
