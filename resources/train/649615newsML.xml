<title>MEXICO: Mexico peso sheds early gains on dollar buyback.</title>
<headline>Mexico peso sheds early gains on dollar buyback.</headline>

<p>The Mexican peso ceded some earlier gains at the close on Tuesday after dealers decided to buy back some dollars they had sold, but at cheaper prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw a lot of irrational (dollar) selling this morning...,&quot; a trader said. &quot;There was no dollar inflow ...for the peso to have firmed so much.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate ended 0.45 and 0.6 of a centavo firmer, respectively, at 7.9750/7.9780 and 7.9720/7.9740 per dollar.  </p>
<p>The 48-hour peso had earlier firmed to 7.9650/7.9780 per dollar in mid-morning trade.</p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts closed mid-morning 1.7 centavos firmer at 7.9570/7.9620 per dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Dealers went short dollars at 7.9700 per dollar in the hope the peso would get stronger, but it didn't work so they had to buy back dollars,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was sheer speculation. Even locals who tried to firm the peso ended up having to buy dollars,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Dealers said forecast gains in domestic interest rates at the central bank's primary auction tonight only partly justified a firmer peso.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see there being much demand at the Cetes auction. I didn't see many foreigners buying pesos to bid for Cetes, and the market won't like that. You may see the peso soften because of that tomorrow,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Nine money market dealers surveyed by Reuters predicted Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 28-day Cetes at an average of 20.77 percent. This would be an increase of 147 basis points.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico was due to announce the results of its primary action at 1830 local time/2330 GMT.</p>
