<p>Canadian bonds opened stronger on Friday, with spreads to U.S. long bonds narrowing on weaker than expected U.S. jobs data and more gains in the Canadian dollar, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market at this point in time is just consolidating. Obviously we had some cash enter the market after the nonfarm payrolls numbers, which were in our view mildly positive,&quot; said one Toronto bond dealer with a bank-owned brokerage.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark rose C$0.08 to C$110.58 to yield 7.102 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.92 percent. The spread between the two bonds narrowed to 18 basis points from 20 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets were initially much stronger after the U.S. Labor Department reported the economy added 142,000 new jobs in April, below expectations of a 211,000 increase. However, the report also showed the jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent, the lowest in over 23 years.</p>
<p>Investors quickly pared bond market gains by selling to lock in profits on both the morning's gains and strong gains made during the past three sessions, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Canadian bonds outperformed U.S. Treasuries amid further strength in the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>The currency continued its recent rally, firming past C$1.3825 (US$0.7233) as investors continued to bet against the possibility of a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike on May 20, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks at the dollar here now and feels that there's some good fundamental strength there, good opportunity there. And Fed or Bank of Canada (rate) increases seem to be a little bit on the back burner at this point in time,&quot; the dealer said.  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bonds rose C$0.20 to C$103.25 to yield 6.537 percent. The U.S. bond fell 1/32 to yield 6.68 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds widened to 14 basis points from 10 basis points on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.04 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.22 percent.</p>
