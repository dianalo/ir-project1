<p>Europe's currency market will go back to scrutinising the budgetary positions in Germany and France, the core countries of monetary union, now that the latest EU summit is safely out of the way, analysts say.</p>
<p>First it will assess how France's fledgling left-wing government intends to harmonise its promises of less austerity and its commitment to Europe's single currency project, which demands rigid fiscal discipline.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's debut parliamentary speech on Thursday will be the first attempt at trying to appease his domestic and global audience on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Jospin got something out of the Amsterdam summit but probably not as much as he would have liked, or as much as he indicated before the elections,&quot; said Adrian Owens, international economist at Julius Baer Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;He will try to appease his domestic audience in the speech, but the international community will be giving a lot of attention to what he says,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Any sign from Jospin that France is at odds with other nations over EMU could boost the mark against its European counterparts, analysts said, as is usually the case when the market scents danger over the single currency project.</p>
<p>The latest currency move of this sort came last week, when France said ahead of this week's summit that it needed more time before agreeing an EMU budget stability pact, insisting on more emphasis on jobs and growth.</p>
<p>A last-minute compromise was reached, as many had expected, but memories of the dispute have made the market more nervous about Jospin's parliamentary speech.</p>
<p>Jospin is also expected to announce on Thursday an audit of public finances, which would give an indication of how close France is to the target of a budget deficit-to-GDP ratio of three percent required for EMU membership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the focus will also be on Germany, also haunted by the fear it will miss the deficit target, with the market constantly on the alert for any pointers on Germany's budget and economic performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly among the circles in Germany that take the stability pact seriously there is now great concern Germany itself will set a poor example, and if that happens, other nations will think they have similarly wide leeway in meeting any conditions,&quot; said Stephen Lewis, chief economist at London Bond Broking.</p>
<p>Such concerns were not helped by the German Bundesbank's monthly report on Wednesday, which said Germany's public authorities were likely to have bigger budget deficits than planned in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This is likely to be a long, drawn-out issue. (German Finance Minister Theo) Waigel is probably not going to give any firm indication of his plans (for the budget) until July 10, when he will present them to the cabinet,&quot; Lewis said.</p>
<p>&quot;And one presumes that through privatisation and maybe other cosmetic devices, he will be able to present numbers which, at least on paper, show the German deficit being close to three percent this year.&quot;</p>
<p>On the whole, European currencies looked set for a fairly mild spell.</p>
<p>The mark will have a softer tone on the perception, strengthened after the EU summit, that Europe's leaders were determined to push forward with a broad-based EMU and that few would dare to rock the boat, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the summit and the run-up to it, the market is now very much under the belief that the political will for EMU to go ahead is very strong,&quot; said Deborah Read, economic adviser at Bank America here.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like they'll be able to fudge their way through one way or another...and now the chances seem to be that we will get a broad-based EMU with a soft currency,&quot; she said.</p>
