<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan dollar ends lower after US strike on Iraq.</title>
<headline>Taiwan dollar ends lower after US strike on Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Taiwan dollar closed lower on Tuesday, reflecting flight to the U.S. dollar as the United States mounted air strikes against Iraq. Dealers said the local unit could weaken further if Gulf tensions continue.</p>
<p>The local unit closed at T$27.516 against Monday's T$27.505. Turnover was an active US$281 million.</p>
<p>The rate wavered narrowly in early trade but weakened after the Pentagon said the U.S. military had launched missile strikes against air defense targets in Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi military attacks against Kurds. &quot;The U.S. dollar will continue to rise if tensions in the Gulf remain high,&quot; said one dealer.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is usually more demand for U.S. dollars during wartime,&quot; the dealer said. &quot;But there is also selling pressure on the U.S. dollar at around T$27.52-53.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. dollar selling pressure was expected from possible entry of foreign equity funds after Morgan Stanley's inclusion of Taiwan into its global indices from September 2.</p>
<p>However, dealers agreed that the movement of the local market would largely depend on the U.S. dollar performance overseas and fresh developments from the Gulf.</p>
<p>The expected a T$27.50-55 trading range for Wednesday.</p>
