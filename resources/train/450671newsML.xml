<p>The Bundesbank on Tuesday lent credence to an escape clause which could allow Germany to squeeze into Europe's single currency despite its high debt, but doubt still remained as to whether Bonn would be able to cut back its public deficits in time to qualify for the euro.</p>
<p>In its March monthly report, the Bundesbank appeared to give backing to the argument that Germany deserved special treatment on the demand that its total public debt had only swollen beyond target due to the strains of German unification.</p>
<p>&quot;The unique event of the unification of Germany, including the takeover of the state and trade liabilities of the former DDR, lies behind the swelling of public debt,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Unification costs were responsible for more than half of the surge in total debt to 2.135 trillion marks ($1.3 trillion) at end-1996 from 1989's 929 billion marks, it added, warning however that Bonn's finances were &quot;precarious&quot; and must be improved.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank comment came just one day after German Finance Minister Theo Waigel gained the assurance of European Union finance ministers in Brussels that German unification had to be taken into account when assessing the fitness of Germany's debt books for monetary union.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, governments must meet set targets on interest and exchange rates, inflation, public debt and budget deficits this year to qualify for the start of monetary union on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Germany is struggling on both fiscal criteria, with its debt above the Maastricht-recommended maximum of 60 percent of gross domestic product and its deficit set to total 2.9 percent of GDP in 1997, just a whisker below the three percent target.</p>
<p>With unemployment currently at record levels, many independent economists say the 2.9 percent forecast looks over-optimistic, raising the spectre of Europe's largest economy and former taskmaster itself not making the grade for EMU.</p>
<p>Doubts exist even within the Bundesbank itself, pouring fuel on financial market speculation that Germany's failure to qualify could lead to a delay in the 1999 EMU launch.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher said on Tuesday that delay in European monetary union was the only option if, as he expected, Bonn were unable to meet criteria necessary to meet Maastricht Treaty deficit criteria.</p>
<p>In an interview with &quot;Boerse Online&quot; magazine, Kuehbacher said he saw little chance that Bonn would be able to cut its budget deficit far enough.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the current economic developments I have my doubts,&quot; Kuehbacher said. &quot;The first two months show the first signs that tax revenues are lagging behind.&quot;</p>
<p>Countries' strict qualification for EMU according to the letter of the Treaty is a major issue in Germany, where the strict application of the criteria has been firmly linked to the stability of the future currency.</p>
<p>Thus Germany has so far given no hint that it could use unification as an excuse to exceed the deficit target, even though a high debt burden clearly means high interest payments.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Waigel made clear in Brussels that this explanation only applied to the debt goal. &quot;Three is three,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;But I have never commented on 60.&quot;</p>
<p>Use of this excuse on deficits would be doubly difficult, as politicians in Germany, conscious of the public's wariness of an untested euro which will replace their cherished mark, have long linked the stability of the single currency to the magic three percent level on the deficit target.</p>
<p>Yet Portuguese prime minister Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday he believed Germany would qualify for monetary union regardless of whether it met all the economic tests for entry.</p>
<p>&quot;I admit the hypothesis (of Germany's entry without satisfying all the criteria)...providing it is for special circumstances and not structural,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The German press, sharing Kuehbacher's scepticism as to whether the three percent target could be met, concluded that Europe appeared to be edging closer to pushing back the lauded start of its project of the century -- and concluded that the single currency would not suffer as a result.</p>
<p>Motivated in part by concern that a 1999 euro could be a weak currency, the Handelsblatt business daily commented &quot;Postponement does not mean abandonment&quot;, while the Munich-published Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in its editorial, &quot;A delay wouldn't mean the fall of Europe.&quot;</p>
