<p>World-wide investment by UK venture capital firms totalled a record 3.3 billion sterling in 1996, the British Venture Capital Association said on Monday.</p>
<p>It said in a report the figure was up 28 percent on 1995 and reflected a 31 percent rise in UK investment to 2.81 billion sterling.</p>
<p>The survey, based on data from 96 percent of BVCA members, said investment in management buy-outs and buy-ins totalled 2.08 billion sterling, while start-up and other early stage investments rose by 54 percent to 131 million.</p>
<p>The average size of a financing was 2.3 million, well up on 1995's 1.9 million.</p>
<p>Regional breakdowns showed a 49 percent rise in investment in the South East to 1.22 billion sterling, and a doubling in East Anglia to 82 million.</p>
<p>Independent venture capital firms, which primarily raise funds from pension funds and insurance companies, raised investment by 76 percent to 1.77 billion sterling.</p>
<p>UK investors remained the largest source of funding, providing 57 percent of the total, but the U.S. was becoming increasingly important in contributing 822 million sterling -- 3.5 times that in 1995.</p>
<p>BVCA chairman David Quysner said the MBO and MBI financing continued to take the largest slice of funding, but the majority of investments in 1996 were in early stage and expanding companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Good returns can now clearly be demonstrated by many MBO/MBI and development funds, and early stage investments are increasingly showing that they too can offer satisfactory returns,&quot; he said.</p>
