<p>Sales of existing homes fell in October for the fifth straight month due to a slowing economy, and further declines were expected, a trade group said Monday.</p>
<p>Existing home sales fell 1.5 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.97 million units from a revised 4.03 million units in September, the National Association of Realtors said.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see housing numbers continue to come down,&quot; said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the association.</p>
<p>In coming months, home sales could slip to an annual rate of about 3.85 million to 3.9 million units, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We may edge up next month, but I seriously doubt it,&quot; Tuccillo said of the November data, which will be released in December.</p>
<p>The October sales rate showed a bigger decline than Wall Street economists' forecast of a drop to a 4.0 million unit annual rate. The October rate was down 2.5 percent from a 4.07 million unit sales rate in October 1995.</p>
<p>Existing home sales have declined steadily since setting a record in May of 4.28 million units at an annualized rate. The trade group is projecting 4.09 million sales of existing homes during 1996 and 3.84 million in 1997.</p>
<p>Tuccillo said the declines were due to the economy's slowing to about 2 percent growth.</p>
<p>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage rates were expected to fall by about a quarter of a percentage point through the end of the year and possibly by another quarter point early next year, Tuccillo said.</p>
<p>If that were to occur, it would probably set off a &quot;rash&quot; of refinancings, he said.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., the national average commitment rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in October was 7.92 percent, down from 8.23 percent in September.</p>
<p>The median sales price, the midpoint where half the homes sold for more and half for less, was $116,400 in October, down from $117,800 the prior month. The median price was higher than October 1995, when it was at $113,200.</p>
<p>Paul Taylor, senior economist at America's Community Bankers, said the build-up in the amount of existing homes waiting to be sold could have a spillover effect and slow sales of new homes if it continues to increase.</p>
<p>The Realtors' data showed that the number of existing homes available for sale rose to 2.36 million in October from 2.15 million in September and 1.89 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The October inventory would take 7.1 months to sell at the current pace, up from 6.4 months in September and 5.6 months in October 1995, according to the report.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a significant number of additional houses that are out there for sale, but not selling,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;This gradual accumulation has gotten to the point that it bears some focus as a sign that the economy is slowing somewhat.&quot;</p>
