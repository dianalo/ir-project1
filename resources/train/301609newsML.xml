<p>At least 40 people were believed to have been massacred by leftist guerrillas in a remote region of northwest Colombia on Saturday, according to unconfrimed reports from an amateur radio operator.</p>
<p>Col. Mario Ramirez, of the national police, said the unconfirmed reports suggested members of the National Liberation Army (ELN) opened fire on a boat near the town of Rio Sucio in Choco province, close to the border with Panama.</p>
<p>Ramirez said that according to the report from the radio ham, relayed to police headquarters in Quidbo, the provincial capital of Choco, the dead people were all civilians.</p>
<p>&quot;We're urgently trying to check out this report. This is not easy because this is a very remote region close to the border with Panama. For the time being I must stress this is an unconfirmed report,&quot; Ramirez told Reuters in a phone interview.</p>
<p>The attack, if proved to be true, comes a day after ELN rebels stormed the town of Rio Sucio and killed one policeman and wounded three others.</p>
<p>The border region between Colombia and Panama is one of the world's most violent areas. It is the scene of frequent, deadly encounters between leftist rebels, the armed forces and right-wing paramilitary gangs.</p>
