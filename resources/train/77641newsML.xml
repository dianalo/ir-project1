<p>NYMEX heating oil ended lower Thursday on profit-taking after rocketing to fresh post-Gulf War highs on supply tightness in the United States and Europe, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had gained four cents in the last two days, so we were due for some profit-taking,&quot; said Ed Kevelson, director of refined products for Paribas Futures Inc.</p>
<p>October heating oil settled 0.87 cent lower at 70.90 cents a gallon, but had risen as high as 72.80, shattering its post-Gulf War high of 72.25 made the week of November 8, 1991.  </p>
<p>The price of heating oil has risen more than 25 percent in the last three months.</p>
<p>November crude followed heating oil's price gyrations and settled down 30 cents a barrel at $24.16.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was all over the place after breaking new highs in heating oil. Gasoline, the most undervalued leg of the oil complex, held its own though,&quot; said Thomas Blakeslee of Cargill Investor Services.</p>
<p>October gasoline fell less than the others, settling only 0.11 cent lower to 62.99 cents a gallon. Traders said gasoline prices have bottomed after heavy selling over the past month.</p>
<p>Besides profit-taking, dealers said buying dried up in heating oil since its new highs had made it too expensive to export. Heating oil prices have been lower than gas oil, the European equivalent of heating oil, making it profitable for dealers to buy U.S. heating oil and send it to Europe.</p>
<p>However, traders said Thursday's weaker settlement in heating oil was simply a pause in a strong price uptrend on historically low supplies.</p>
<p>In its latest weekly inventory data, the American Petroleum Institute said heating oil stocks are 18 million barrels below a year ago.</p>
