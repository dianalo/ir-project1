<p>Two big British insurance brokers, Fenchurch Plc and Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings Plc, said on Friday they were in talks for a possible merger, the latest consolidation move in the insurance industry.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, they said that any merger would be based on &quot;the relative maintainable earnings attributable to shareholders&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The boards believe that Fenchurch and Lowndes Lambert have strong complementary businesses and that combining them could offer significant benefits to their respective clients, employees and shareholders,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are both very strong in retail business...it will benefit both of us,&quot; Lowndes Lambert managing director David Margett told Reuters.</p>
<p>Lambert said neither insurer had set any deadline but the firms were hoping to move rapidly.</p>
<p>Insurance analysts felt a merger would be more &quot;volume driven&quot; than &quot;complementary&quot;. &quot;It's a potential acquisition that Lowndes Lambert could make use of in the future,&quot; said Robin Savage, analyst with Credit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>Although a significant portion of Fenchurch's volume comes from retail insurance, analysts said its wholesale and reinsurance business plus a few specialised personal retail products might have attracted Lowndes Lambert.</p>
<p>Fenchurch's annual brokerage fees stand at around 38 million pounds ($64 million) while those of Lowndes and Lambert are around 80 million pounds.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the merger to be a paper transaction.</p>
<p>Another analyst said Fenchurch would be better off with the merger as its revenue had been weak for the last several months and it did not have much overseas business to look for volumes.</p>
<p>&quot;One might find a few Fenchurch directors leaving comfortably,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Fenchurch had a pre-tax profit of of 4.78 million pounds for the six months to September 30, 1996 with earnings per share at 7.4 pence. Chairman Rupert Hambro then blamed overcapacity and intense competition for a slide in its profit which fell from previous year's 5.9 million.</p>
<p>Most British insurance firms have been recently forced to cut premiums leading to lower commissions to brokers, and the brokerage industry is in a process of consolidation.</p>
<p>Last month, Lloyd Thomson Group and JIB Group Group announced they would merge in a 300 million pound deal.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected Fenchurch's operations to benefit from Lowndes Lambert's management.</p>
<p>Share market participants showed their support, with Fenchurch touching a high of 70 pence before settling for a gain of 6-1/2 pence at 64-1/2. Lowndes Lambert was up seven at 110p. ($1=.5922 Pound)</p>
