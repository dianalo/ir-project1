<p>Fewer children died in Cuba in 1986 than the year before, continuing a trend of lower infant mortality that was among the world's 20 top countries for this health indicator, Cuban officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Communist-ruled Cuba, which prides itself on its free and universal health care, said the country's infant mortality rate fell in 1996 to just 7.9 deaths per thousand live births compared with 9.4 deaths in 1995.</p>
<p>Facing criticism over its one-party political system, Havana argues such social achievements should be taken into account when considering its human rights performance.</p>
<p>Citing the United Nations Childrens' Fund (UNICEF) report on world infant health for 1997, the Communist Party daily Granma said the 1996 figure meant Cuba was among the few countries in the world with infant mortality rates of lower than eight deaths per thousand live births. The rate measures deaths of children up to the age of one year.</p>
<p>Sweden, Finland and Japan top the list for this indicator with rates of four deaths per thousand live births, according to the UNICEF report.</p>
<p>Cuba far outstrips all other Latin American countries for the indicator. The next best rate in the region in Chile with 13 deaths per thousand live births, according to the UNICEF report.</p>
<p>The Cuban medical system has been badly hit by the economic crisis of the last six years. There are frequent shortages of medicines and conditions in hospitals have deteriorated.</p>
<p>The low infant mortality rate is due in part to a system that is paternalistic in nature, and in part to the fact the indicator is viewed as politically crucial.</p>
<p>All pregnant women undergo frequent checkups. Home births are not permitted and virtually all of Cuba's 140,226 births last year were in clinics or hospitals.</p>
