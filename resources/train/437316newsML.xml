<p>German shares closed bourse trade sharply lower on Wednesday, with chemicals and drugs giant Hoechst AG to blame for much of the fall after a surprise move to pull a separate listing of its HMR drugs subsidiary.</p>
<p>The DAX-30 index of leading German shares was 45.19 points, or 1.31 percent down, at 3,415.40 as the index elsewhere was hit by the sluggishness of the dollar, trading at under 1.7100 marks, and Wall Street's mixed close overnight.</p>
<p>Shares in Hoechst plunged as much as 13 percent in active bourse dealings after the German chemical and pharmaceuticals group said it would not list its Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR) unit on the stock market.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was surprised and disappointed, as the move had been widely expected as a means of increasing Hoechst shareholder value.</p>
<p>&quot;The announcement today has taken all speculative interest out of the stock,&quot; said one London-based trader.</p>
<p>He added that he expected a number of downgrades to follow the company's meeting with analysts on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the group had already disappointed markets by reporting a 2.5 percent drop in sales to 50.9 billion marks and saying it pre-tax profit climbed by 29.06 percent to 5.28 billion marks, largely due to earnings from divestments.</p>
<p>Hoechst closed 8.10 marks, or 10.3 percent, lower at 70.45.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, dealers complained of a lack of stimuli to drive the market upwards. &quot;Trading volumes outside Hoechst are small at the moment, which is a bit worrying,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>March DAX futures fell 11.5 points to 3,418.5.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom  however continued its rise of recent days as investors sought out stocks, it included, that had not fully participated in the DAX's rally of recent months.</p>
<p>Germany's incumbent telecom operator ended 80 pfennigs up at 35.65, briefly hitting a new high of 35.95, as continued stock shortages squeezed the price up.</p>
