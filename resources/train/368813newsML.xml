<p>South Australia lost their way after openers Martin Faull and Ben Johnson posted a century partnership on the first day of their Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although still in a strong position, a middle order collapse left the visitors on 251 for five at close of play at Hobart's Bellerive Oval.</p>
<p>Johnson and Faull put on 165 for the first wicket after South Australia captain Jamie Siddons won the toss in fine conditions.</p>
<p>Johnson scored 91, including eight boundaries, off 169 deliveries, while Faull contributed 62 to his side's biggest first wicket partnership of the season.</p>
<p>Faull's departure triggered the collapse, with Johnson, Siddons, Darren Lehmann and Geoff Parker quickly following the opener back to the pavilion for the addition of just 38 runs.</p>
<p>Tasmania fast bowler Josh Marquet posed the biggest threat and his efforts were rewarded with figures of three for 62 from 22 overs.</p>
<p>Tasmania will move into second place in the Sheffield Shield standings with an outright victory, worth six points, over South Australia, who prop up the table.</p>
<p>Western Australia lead the competition with 28 points, six points clear of Queensland and New South Wales. Tasmania are in fourth place on 18 points.</p>
