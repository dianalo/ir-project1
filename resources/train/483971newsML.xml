<p>Canadian bonds ended weaker on Thursday, sharply underperforming U.S. treasuries, as the Canadian dollar weakened further ahead of key Canadian and U.S. employment reports out on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a question of foreign exchange market nervousness about the Bank (of Canada) not going last time and potentially not going next time to match the Fed. Foreign exchange markets are waiting to take their cue from the Bank of Canada,&quot; said Mark Chandler, senior economist with Goldman Sachs Canada.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.46 to C$107.25 to yield 7.370 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 1/32 to yield 7.07 percent. The spread between the two bonds widened to 30 basis points from 27 basis points at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;All eyes are on the March jobs report and the Bank of Canada, Another run on the currency Thursday impeached the Bank of Canada to tighten,&quot; Jeoff Hall, Canadian market analyst with financial analysis firm Technical Data, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Canada's dollar weakened sharply past C$1.39 (US$0.7194) on Thursday, prompting the Bank of Canada to intervene to defend the currency.  </p>
<p>Weighing on the currency is concern that tomorrow's U.S. employment report for March will be stronger than expected. A strong U.S. report would be further cause for the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates in May.</p>
<p>That possibility raises the question of how the Bank of Canada would respond, analysts said. Investors are expecting the strength of tomorrow's Canadian employment report to be an indication of whether the Bank of Canada will soon hike rates.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.59 to C$101.10 to yield 6.841 percent. The U.S. bond rose 3/32 to yield 6.85 percent.  </p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds fell to one basis point, from nine basis points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.23 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.27 percent.</p>
