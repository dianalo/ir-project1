<p>The central Reserve Bank of Malawi on Tuesday announced a four percentage point cut in its lending rate to 23 percent effective from August 1.</p>
<p>Bank governor Matthews Chikaonda told reporters the move was part of the government's policy response to international trading patterns with neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>In the past week the kwacha has depreciated from around 15.4 against the dollar to around 17 kwacha on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chikaonda dismissed fears that the currency would depreciate further.</p>
<p>&quot;This (the depreciation) is perfectly normal, it is part of the normal functioning of a liberalised market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the bank was aware the currency would depreciate, as it had been under pressure after its regional trading partners had undergone similar experiences.  </p>
<p>The kwacha has been hovering around 15 against the dollar for the last two years, but in the last week it fell to a low of 17.70, before recovering a little ground.</p>
<p>Chikaonda said the bank would begin holding back on its foreign reserves and would limit the sale of foreign exchange to commodity dealers if necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a deliberate policy stand to support the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He estimated the government had lost up to $25 million over the past year through currency transactions by &quot;unscrupulous dealers&quot; who had evaded official channels.</p>
<p>In November last year, the bank cut its lending rates by eight percentage points from 35 percent, after a cut in September from 45 percent.</p>
