<p>The Peruvian government and Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages for the 69th day on Monday began a fresh round of talks to find a bloodless solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>A Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) spokesman, believed to be its leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, was driven in a white Red Cross car to a safe house where government negotiator Domingo Palermo was waiting to start the meeting.  </p>
<p>MRTA rebels who have occupied the Japanese ambassador's residence across the road from the safe house since Dec. 17 broadcast their revolutionary anthem and shouted slogans as Cerpa, apparently accompanied by his deputy Rolly Rojas, was transported to the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We are the ones who have taken the Japanese residence. Until death, damn it!&quot; they shouted.</p>
<p>The three members of a guarantors' commission for the talks, Red Cross official Michel Minnig, Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent and Peruvian Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani, representing the Vatican, also attended the negotiations.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's observer, Terusuke Tarada, was also present at the meeting under a Red Cross flag in a two-floor terracotta-coloured building.</p>
