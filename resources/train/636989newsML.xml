<headline>Conn. House passes racial school isolation bill.</headline>
<dateline>HARTFORD 1997-06-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Connecticut House of Representatives on Wednesday passed legislation aimed at correcting educational iniquities in the state's public schools.</p>
<p>The bill is a first step in addressing racial isolation and education quality issues that were the subject of the landmark Sheff vs. O'Neill lawsuit, Rep. Edna Garcia (D) said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this legislation is the beginning of the end of racial isolation in our state's public schools,&quot; Garcia said.</p>
<p>The state supreme court last year ordered the legislature to find a remedy to the inferior schools and segregation that divides Hartford and its suburbs.</p>
<p>Hartford's schools serve some of the poorest children in the state. They score the lowest in the state on standardized tests.</p>
<p>Schools in Hartford are 95 percent black and Hispanic, compared to largely white and wealthier populations in the suburbs around the city.</p>
<p>Garcia said that in spite of her work on the bill, it did not achieve the full scope of what the court intended.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not achieve the equalization of urban and suburban schools,&quot; she said. Neither does the bill provide a measurable standard for reducing racial, ethnic and economic isolation.</p>
<p>Funding for important parts of the legislation are vague, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) I believe we will fill in the gaps as we move forward on this important issue,&quot; Garcia said.</p>
