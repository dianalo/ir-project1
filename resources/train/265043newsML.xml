<p>NWE naphtha prices were steady to slightly higher on Wednesday but end-user demand was lacklustre and traders said the market continued to nestle into contango.</p>
<p>&quot;It really is calm for the physical market from the end-users,&quot; one source said. &quot;If there is interest it is more for January...There is not much discussion for prompt material.&quot;</p>
<p>A 6,000 tonne Russian piece was believed placed on Tuesday at a discount, further reflecting the weakness in prompt prices to early January, he said.</p>
<p>Jan swaps confirmed traded at $224, up $2 while Feb was seen $1 higher at $217/$218.</p>
<p>NWE cargoes were notionally set at about $219/$223 cif, but traders said no physical deals were done and would likely be done at lower levels.</p>
<p>Bids for pipeline spec material heard earlier in the week at higher levels to cargoes, appeared to disappear by today, they said.</p>
<p>Shipping sources said Dow fixed the World Process tanker for 27,500 tonnes of naphtha out of Skikda on Dec 20 for the U.K./Continent.</p>
<p>Stinnes fixed the Rose for 27,000 tonnes out of Ras Lanuf on Dec 28 for Brindisi, Italy, they said.</p>
