<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ's Labour damaging coalition chances - Laws.</title>
<headline>NZ's Labour damaging coalition chances - Laws.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-11-29</dateline>

<p>A close friend and former key adviser of nationalist New Zealand First leader Winston Peters on Friday said the centre-left Labour Party was the logical choice as a coalition partner for NZ First, but was damaging its chances by demanding the top jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;The only proper strategic and political choice for NZ First is a coalition with Labour,&quot; former New Zealand First MP Michael Laws said in his fortnightly column in the Evening Post newspaper.  </p>
<p>But he said Labour and the left wing Alliance grouping which is likely to back it &quot;seem to be doing their very public best to resist this conclusion&quot;.</p>
<p>Laws said Labour leader Helen Clark's negotiating tactics were mystifying and her insistence on retaining the key positions of prime minister, foreign affairs and trade and finance were causing concern in NZ First ranks.</p>
<p>NZ First holds the balance of power and is negotiating with both Labour and the incumbent conservative National Party over the shape of the next government.  </p>
<p>Together NZ First and National would command 61 votes in the 120-seat parliament. But Labour and NZ First would need the backing of the 13 Alliance MPs to be assured of a majority.</p>
<p>NZ First is expected to make a decision next week.</p>
<p>Laws said he understood Labour was also trying to retain the health and education portfolios in any coalition cabinet. &quot;For NZ First to be squeezed out of those five major areas -- when it can realistically demand at least two of them -- produces just the one reaction. The red stop light,&quot; Laws said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Clearly there are large concerns within NZ First at any prospect of dining with the National devils,&quot; Laws said, adding National had been crafty and slippery in the negotiations by an emphasis on generalities. NZ First has said it wants a coalition agreement to include detailed policy.</p>
<p>Laws said it would be easier to deal with National's attacks from the opposition benches than with attacks from Labour and the Alliance, who had experience in opposition.  </p>
<p>Peters has said he wants a coalition arrangement to last longer than the three year parliamentary term, and the prospect of sharing a platform with some key National ministers in 1999 must make NZ First shudder, Laws said.</p>
<p>&quot;You are known by the company you keep -- that kind of political company is rat poison to NZ First supporters and voters,&quot; Laws said.</p>
