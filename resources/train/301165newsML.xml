<p>Japanese maritime safety officials worked frantically on Saturday to protect a string of coastal nuclear power plants threatened by the nation's worst oil spill.</p>
<p>The cleanup operation, the biggest ever in Japan, is spread across a 450 km (285-mile) stretch of Japan's western coast. But officials are now concentrating efforts on keeping the oil away from 15 nuclear power stations.</p>
<p>The plants, the largest concentration of nuclear power production in the world, dot Wakasa Bay on the Sea of Japan. The sea water is vital to keeping the reactors from over-heating.</p>
<p>&quot;From today oil cleanup operations will be centred on Wakasa bay,&quot; a Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) spokesman said at a Saturday morning briefing.</p>
<p>He said that a plastic fence across part of the bay designed to stop the heavy oil slick had failed to hold.</p>
<p>Slicks have already come ashore some 20 km (12 miles) from the nearest reactor and several were heading for the plants and expected to reach land by Sunday.</p>
<p>Maritime safety officials said their earlier estimate that 3,700 tonnes (26,000 barrels) of oil had spilled from the 13,157-tonne tanker Nakhodka was far too low. The 26-year old tanker was carrying 19,000 tonnes (133,000 barrels) of fuel oil when it broke up in stormy seas on January 2.</p>
<p>Transport Minister Makoto Koga, who heads a disaster task force, told reporters during a visit to the area on Friday that task force officials were running out of ways to stop the spill as the oil spread over a larger area.</p>
<p>Oil fences, typically used to contain surface oil slicks, are only effective in the early stages of heavy oil spills. Once air within the oil disappears, it turns into thick globs that sink below the surface and pass under the fence.</p>
<p>Sinking globs of oil could pose a threat to the reactors if they get into underwater intake pipes set about five metres (16 feet) below sea level.</p>
<p>But nuclear power plant officials were cautiously optimistic that there would be no disruption in power output.</p>
<p>Kansai Electric Power Co said its 11 reactors around Wakasa Bay were operating normally on Saturday and officials said they had no plans yet to reduce power production.</p>
<p>&quot;The oil slicks aren't close yet so we're continuing operation of the plants as normal,&quot; a Kansai Electric spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if a small amount of oil enters the intake pipes, it should not be a problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The utility serves Osaka, Japan's second-biggest metropolitan area. The plants generate 27 percent of the company's total power output.</p>
<p>As the messy cleanup continued, the Russian owners of the tanker said they would pay for the mess.</p>
<p>The Interfax news agency quoted Sergei Vitkazov, chief executive of Prisco Traffic Ltd, which owns the vessel, as saying that the company would use insurance money to pay for compensation.</p>
<p>While there has been no estimate of the total cost of the cleanup, he said the tanker and its cargo were insured for up to $500 million, a figure confirmed by underwriters in London.</p>
<p>The 31-man crew on the tanker, which broke in two, were rescued but the captain is missing and presumed dead.</p>
