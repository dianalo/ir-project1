<p>There are 19 days to go before the British colony reverts to China. These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>-- MING PAO said that although the High Court ruled that the Democratic Party could not challenge the provisional legislature in court, the laws passed by the interim body might still be questioned after the handover and its operations might be considered against the Basic Law. The paper warned that members of the provisional legislature should only do things which were necessary, otherwise the Special Administrative Region court might be forced to over-rule the body's unnecessary decisions, which might lead to a consitutional crisis.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMIC JOURNAL said the Hong Kong government was the biggest landowner in the territory and was well able to affect land and property prices. But Chief Executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa should not take overly heavy-handed measures which have a negative effect on the economy, the paper said.</p>
<p>-- The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO said the refusal of a High Court judge to handle the Democratic Party's challenge towards the legality of the provisional legislature was sensible, because the whole attempt was a farce. Many countries had agreed that the establishment of the provisional legislature was a necessity since the British side first violated the diplomatic agreements between London and Beijing.</p>
<p>--The English-language HONGKONG STANDARD said the Democratic Party should consider the advice of the judge that Hong Kong courts should not be used for political purposes. By intending to challenge the provisional legislature in court, the Democrats had allowed their opponents to cast doubts on their political acumen.</p>
