<p>Shares in Italy's financial holding group Gemina yo-yoed on Monday as investors tried to assess the impact of a big restructuring operation which will see the group separated into two listed companies.</p>
<p>Gemina shares were suspended on Friday ahead of the group's announcement it would separate its industrial and financial interests. When the shares resumed trading on Monday they swiftly rose, only to fall back when the market took a more considered view.</p>
<p>&quot;The market saw the news as positive, but there is still a lot of detail missing to the plan and caution has prevailled,&quot; said the head of share dealing at a major Italian brokerage.</p>
<p>The shares rose to a high of 788 lire in early trading before slipped 1.6 percent to 748 lire in a generally firmer Milan bourse at 1200 GMT.</p>
<p>Late Friday, Gemina announced it would group together its industrial holdings including publishing, textiles and paper as well as its stakes in banking groups into a new company to be called Holding di Partecipazioni Industriali HPI SpA.</p>
<p>This would group its stakes in RCS Editori publishing, paper group Cartiere Burgo and textile group Fila and GFT into the HPI group with a stock market listing to be sought.</p>
<p>Gemina itself would manage its own financial companies including Gemina Capital Markets and other financial groups.</p>
<p>The move marked the latest saga in Gemina which late last year was to be used as a holding vehicle for a massive merger including the old-Ferruzzi Finanziaria and agro-industry Montedison and some chemical and fibre interests of Fiat.</p>
<p>But this so-called &quot;SuperGemina&quot; plan hit problems as tax police raided RCS offices and launched a investigation into allegedly fraudulent book-keeping.</p>
<p>&quot;Gemina is trying to get its act in order. But simply moving its assets around is not the answer. We need to see some clear signs of improvement,&quot; said one Milan-based analyst.</p>
<p>Gemina said its RCS group showed continuing signs of improvement at the operating level, after sharp losses last year, but analysts were cautious in predicting a quick turnaround in the fortunes of the whole group.</p>
<p>Gemina returned to the black in the first half of 1996 with consolidated net profits of 115.1 billion lire ($76 million) after total losses of 678.5 billion in the whole of 1995. In 1995 it included hefty charges due to losses at Gemina financial interests Gemina Capital Markets and Gemina Financial Products. ($1=1,516 lire)</p>
