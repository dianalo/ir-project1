<headline>THE PROTEUS COLUMN - Equitas.</headline>

<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>Equitas, the company set up by Lloyds of London to reinsure the market's old liabilities, has quietly reached another landmark. Today, Equitas published its first set of accounts, giving a snapshot of its position when it was granted its licence in September last year.</p>
<p>The accounts appear to hold no big surprises and Equitas cautiously said it was on course to cover the insurance market's pre-1992 liabilities.</p>
<p>However, it faces a long journey over several decades and at this early stage in its odyssey, the auditors outlined several concerns.</p>
<p>First, there is the fundamental uncertainty overhanging the whole Equitas project. Nobody has ever carried out such a mammoth task before. Realistically, Equitas knows that it will only be able to shrug off this doubt if and when it largely completes its task some time next century.</p>
<p>Second, the auditors noted their concerns over the quality of some of the unaudited data underpinning the reserving assumptions. Equitas hopes to overcome this problem in time.</p>
<p>Finally, the outcome of litigation in the U.S. could have an effect on the size of some of the liabilities faced by Equitas.</p>
<p>Equitas always was intended to be a long-term project and it would have been surprising if at such an early stage the auditors had given the reinsurer unqualified approval.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, in the longer term Equitas is likely to remain the subject of much interest. If it fails, the implications will be far-reaching. If it succeeds, Lloyd's could find itself with a much sought-after asset.</p>
