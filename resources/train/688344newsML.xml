<p>Michael Johnson, beaten over 400 metres for the first time in eight years on Wednesday, is to go into intensive training before returning to the European grand prix circuit next month.</p>
<p>His manager Brad Hunt said on Thursday that the 200 and 400 Olympic champion would train hard over the next few weeks to reach full fitness for a meeting in the German city of Stuttgart on July 13.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no rest or recuperation. It will be hard training over the next few weeks,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;Hopefully he'll run in Stuttgart. We'll be back in Europe in July.&quot;</p>
<p>Hunt said Johnson, who pulled a thigh muscle in his 150 metres showdown with Olympic sprint champion Donovan Bailey earlier this month, regretted his decision to run in Wednesday's grand prix meeting in Paris.</p>
<p>The American finished a poor fifth behind the winner, compatriot Antonio Pettigrew.</p>
<p>&quot;He's disappointed that he took the decision to run. He misread what his training was indicating,&quot; Hunt said.</p>
<p>Johnson did not train for two weeks after the Toronto clash with Bailey.</p>
<p>&quot;If you take two weeks off, you are going to lose some fitness. He should have probably taken another week's training,&quot; Hunt said.</p>
<p>After the poor Paris run, Johnson immediately pulled out of a grand prix meeting in the Engish city of Sheffield on Sunday. Hunt said he hoped the American would be able to run in Britain later in the season.</p>
