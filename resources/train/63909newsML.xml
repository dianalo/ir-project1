<headline>Croatian Kras says half-year results above plans.</headline>

<p>Croatian chocolate maker Kras d.d. said its results for the first six months of 1996 were well above plans and full-year after-tax profit was also likely to overshoot the targeted 16 million kuna.</p>
<p>&quot;All the categories -- sales, income, profit -- are good. Total sales are 2.5 percent higher than we planned,&quot; finance director Tomislav Jovic told Reuters.</p>
<p>Exports to Bosnia were 50 percent up on the projected level and the company continued to consolidate its leading domestic market position, he added.</p>
<p>Jovic said preliminary first-half figures showed profit also well up after staff costs had been cut down, but declined to reveal any details before an audit.</p>
<p>While imports of confectionery products have been on the increase in Croatia, Kras's market share expanded to some 41 percent between January and August, he said.</p>
<p>It was 38.6 percent at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The share of imports is rising but so is our share,&quot; Jovic said. &quot;They must be stealing someone else's market.&quot;</p>
<p>Kras exports some 25 percent of its total sales, which totalled almost $80 million last year. Its consolidated 1995 profit shrank slightly to 14.8 million kuna from 15.3 million.</p>
<p>But Jovic said the two sets of figures were not completely comparable because subsidiaries in Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia, where already high costs increased last year, had not been fully included in the 1994 report.</p>
<p>The price of Kras shares has soared over the past 10 days, topping roughly 360 kuna they were issued at, to close at 430 kuna on Wednesday on the Zagreb Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Small shareholders, mostly current and former employees, control 53 percent of the company and the rest is owned by the government's privatisation agency and two pension funds.</p>
