<p>**  (1230 GMT) - Indian blue chips end little changed in</p>
<p>	  dull trade</p>
<p>**  Bombay share index down 4.23 points at 3,730.78</p>
<p>**  Tobacco conglomerate ITC gains 4.75 rupees at 424.25</p>

<p>**  Market activity focussed on select stocks, lack of</p>
<p>	  investment buying seen as fears of hike in</p>
<p>	  government-set oil prices remain, traders say</p>
<p>Indian stocks drifted in range-bound trade on Thursday, with lack of market moving news affecting prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unloading by bull operators along with lack of investment buying due to poor company results affected market sentiment,&quot; said Pradip Doshi, a member-broker of the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Most of the front-bencher stocks showed little change amid thin volumes ahead of the last day of weekly settlement at the Bombay Exchange on Friday, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said business was affected due to the closure of major local investment institutions for a local holiday.</p>
<p>Indian money markets were largely inactive due to a bank holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very quiet day. Many dealing rooms wore an empty look,&quot; said an equities dealer at a domestic brokerage.</p>
<p>Tata Iron &amp; Steel Company Ltd (TISCO) ended 0.50 rupees down at 177.75 ahead of its 1996/97 (March-April) annual results.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see profits rising,&quot; said Hozefa Topiwalla, steel analyst at Bombay brokerage firm First Global Finance. &quot;Profits will be flat...there might be a minor downside.&quot;  </p>
<p>The profits of India's private steel maker are seen flat-to-lower in fiscal 1996/97 due to sluggish market and tight margins, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the start of the year we had expected volume growth of 6-7 percent,&quot; said Aniruddha Dange, analyst at ICICI Securities and Finance Company (I-Sec).</p>
<p>&quot;Margins were squeezed as it was not able to pass on higher costs to consumers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dange forecast the net profit at 5.05 billion rupees against 5.67 billion in 1995/96..</p>
