<p>The spotlight will be firmly on impressive French Derby winner Peintre Celebre as he bids to land a Group One double in the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp on Sunday.</p>
<p>Connections of Peintre Celebre have opted to run the high class colt in this 10 furlong race instead of the Irish Derby. He will run with the aid of a pacemaker, Super Cub.</p>
<p>The son of Nureyev is dropping back in distance for the big Parisian event as he reverts to a mile and a quarter.</p>
<p>However, his class should more than compensate, and on form has little to fear from the French Derby fifth and sixth, Ithaki and Shaka.</p>
<p>Both horses were well held at Chantilly, although the Group One Criterium de Saint-Cloud and Group Two Prix Hocquart winner Shaka is undoutebly capable of better.</p>
<p>Shaka, from the yard that won this race in 1994 with Millkom, is expected to play a more active role here and should be suited by the drop back in distance.</p>
<p>Alekos, third in the Prix Hocquart, and Zenith Rose, second in a low key edition of the Group One Prix Lupin, complete the home line up. Alekos is the most appealing of the pair and has an outside chance.</p>
<p>English interests will be represented by Royal Amaretto from the ambitious Brian Meehan yard.</p>
<p>Soft ground specialist Royal Amaretto had a poor run in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and is a place prospect at best.</p>
