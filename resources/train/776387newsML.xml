<p>IMM currency futures closed narrowly mixed in driftless dollar trade, as traders and dealers weighed the possibility of intervention by foreign central banks, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is cautious,&quot; Michael Malpede, senior currency analyst at Refco Inc, said. &quot;There doesn's seem to be much interest in pushing the dollar higher.&quot;</p>
<p>Such concerns kept September marks and Swiss francs above the contract lows that both currencies set overnight. September marks fell to $0.5355 on GLOBEX, below support of $0.5371, or 1.8730 spot, and Swiss francs eased to $0.6547.  </p>
<p>Speculation the Bundesbank may intervene against the dollar lingered in the market on Monday morning after heavy overseas selling on Sunday evening, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The talk is sketchy, but the Bundesbank doesn't have a lot of options right now,&quot; Malpede said.</p>
<p>He dismissed the chance that the Bundesbank could open the door to higher short-term interest rates, since the move could act as a further drag on Germany's economy.</p>
<p>Malpede also noted that cash marks performed well against several European currencies.  </p>
<p>Regarding concerns about Japanese intervention, Malpede said there are &quot;general feelings the Bank of Japan may want to step in at the 119.00 to 120.00 area.&quot;</p>
<p>The 119.00 to 120.00 spot yen area corresponds to $0.008454 to $0.008384 in September yen, traders said.</p>
<p>September yen managed to hold gains above the $0.008500 level late in the session. Resistance is seen at last Friday's high of $0.008540.  </p>
<p>At the close, September yen rose $0.000004 to $0.008502, marks were off $0.0009 to $0.5371, Swiss francs were $0.0003 higher to $0.6584, sterling was down $0.0022 to $1.6262, Canadian dollars gained $0.0009 to $0.7271, Australian dollars were up $0.0029 to $0.7421, and Mexican pesos rose $0.000650 to $0.125875.</p>
