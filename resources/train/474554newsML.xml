<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Friday called on Arab and Moslem countries to take steps to force Israel to stop building Jewish settlements in and around Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani dismissed reports that the Palestinian leader had made a new pledge to stop violence when he met U.S. envoy Dennis Ross in Rabat on Thursday.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday said after meeting with Ross that Arafat had assured the envoy that &quot;terrorism&quot; would stop.</p>
<p>&quot;The president didn't charge Ross with a new position regarding violence because the president's and Palestinian Authority's stand is clear on this issue and does not require to be reaffirmed,&quot; Kanafani told Reuters in a comment on Netanyahu report.</p>
<p>Kanafani was speaking at Tunis airport before Arafat boarded an EgyptAir flight for Cairo on his way back to Gaza.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Arafat told reporters after briefing Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali on the crisis in the Middle East peace process:</p>
<p>&quot;These things...call for a quick Palestinian, Arab and Moslem move to face these dangerous developments not only against Jerusalem but also against the palestinian people.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat said such moves would be based on previous decisions at Moslem and Arab summit meetings.</p>
<p>Resolutions adopted in Islamabad and Cairo last year threatened to freeze diplomatic ties established by some Arab and Moslem states with Israel.</p>
<p>Arafat accused Israel of aiming, through Jewish settlements, to cut Arab East Jerusalem off from Palestinian territories in the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;I told President Ben Ali that despite these difficulties, we will pray together in Jerusalem, capital of the Palestinian state,&quot; he added.</p>
