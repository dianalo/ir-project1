<p>The Philippines, swamped by  cheap sugar imports in recent months, will launch next week a programme  to boost the yield of sugar lands and help mills face global competition,  a senior official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said the local sugar industry,  like other agricultural producers in the country, has to optimise  its operations as tariff walls among countries are starting to crumble.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like ballroom dancing. When the music changes, you have to change  your steps,&quot; Escudero told sugar farmers and millers ahead of the  launching of a sugar productivity programme next week.</p>
<p>The governmnent aims to boost yield of sugar farms in six years from  59 tonnes per hectare of cane to 80 tonnes under the programme, Escudero  said in the meeting in Bacolod city on central Negros island, the  country's sugar bowl.</p>
<p>The programme - the latest move by the government to bale out its  ailing sugar sector - includes proposals to extend credit for the  modernisation of sugar farms and mills by state-owned banks, and distribution  of better yielding cane varieties.</p>
<p>Last month, President Fidel Ramos ordered a freeze on sugar tariffs  on imported southeast Asian sugar at 65 percent for two years beginning  on July 1.</p>
<p>Earlier, as part of its commitment to the ASEAN (Association of South  East Asian Nations) free trade agreement, Manila decided to cut tariffs  to 52.5 percent starting on July 1.</p>
<p>Philippine farmers and millers had complained that the planned tariff  cut would kill the industry.</p>
<p>The Phillippines has been swamped by imported sugar, mostly from Thailand,  in recent months resulting in a sugar glut.</p>
<p>The state-owned National Food Authority had to buy some four billion  pesos worth of domestic sugar to beef up prices early this year.</p>
<p>Domestic raw sugar prices hit a low of 480 pesos per 50-kg bag in  late 1996 from 800 to 900 pesos at the start of that year due to the  glut.</p>
<p>Once a top sugar exporter, the Philippines is now an importer due  to years of complacency and its inability to compete with more efficient  sugar producers.</p>
<p>Escudero said the average sugar yield between crop years 1990/1991  and 1994/1995 (Aug-Sept) in the Philippines was 59 tonnes of cane  per hectare as against the world average of 60.2 tonnes.</p>
<p>The average yield of more efficient sugar producers, like Australia,  was 82.7 tonnes of cane per hectare, officials said.</p>
<p>Millers said the domestic sugar crisis was the result of outdated  farming practices, lack of new technology and insufficient funding.</p>
