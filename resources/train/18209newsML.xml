<p>Bernard Tapie, France's former singer, soccer boss and minister, launched a career as a film star on Wednesday, cast convincingly as a morally dubious lawyer whose role mirrors his own behind-the-screens legal tangles.</p>
<p>Courtesy of award-winning director Claude Lelouch, the bankrupt businessman plays the charismatic and garrulous lead in the much-hyped comedy &quot;Men, Women: Instructions for Use&quot; which opened across the country.</p>
<p>Hiring the 53-year-old Tapie earned Lelouch accusations he had sacrificed morals for money. His fledgling star is embroiled in a flurry of lawsuits and has been convicted of match-rigging, tax evasion and fraud.</p>
<p>Tapie, who will take up to a quarter of profits, bulldozed attacks aside and defiantly announced he would probably star in a second movie too -- likely prison sentences permitting.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was in politics, people wanted to eliminate me. When I was in soccer (as head of first-division Marseille), people wanted to eliminate me. Even before filming started, people wanted to eliminate me from the cinema,&quot; Tapie said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's understandable that the little people attack a symbol of happiness. But it's monstrous that the people who are attacking me are high up the ladder. So I say to hell with them, and I'll try to make another one,&quot; he told Europe-1 radio.</p>
<p>Tape has announced he would resign his French parliamentary seat -- a publicity stunt for the film, since he will be stripped of the seat by October.</p>
<p>On screen Tapie is a flamboyant, playboy lawyer famed for landing his helicopter on the Berlin Wall. His life collapses the day a jilted girlfriend turned doctor seeks revenge by making him believe he has cancer.</p>
<p>The glossy movie is Lelouche at less than his best, despite good performances by second lead Fabrice Luchini among others.</p>
<p>French audiences at least will have a field day spotting similarities between the real-life Tapie and his genial, devious character who reels off one-liners like &quot;Women are like flowers: if you want to keep them for a long time, you mustn't pick them too early&quot;.</p>
<p>Critics took Lelouche to task for giving star billing and a nice-guy image -- Tapie's character offers two buskers a night at a luxury hotel -- to a man with three criminal convictions.</p>
<p>&quot;If cinema uses a corrupt ingredient to sell its soup... it's likely that film stars will no longer be chosen for their talent but for the length of their criminal record,&quot; said popular daily France-Soir.</p>
<p>&quot;That has nothing to do with me and I'm not here to judge,&quot; retorted the bespectacled Lelouche, who won an Oscar for the 1966 romance &quot;A Man and a Woman&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Tapie is 'too much' in everything, and uncontrollable. What I saw in him above all was that he loves life. And I said to myself: 'Let's use that'.&quot;</p>
<p>In &quot;Men, Women: Instructions for Use&quot;, the lawyer's new love for life after he believes himself cured by a miracle prompts him to stage a fake death and start a new life.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd thought at one time of doing the same thing but I gave up on the idea,&quot; Tapie reflected in one interview. &quot;But today, when I see the hatred some people have for me, I realise that I would have made them happy if I'd gone through with it.&quot;</p>
<p>Short of which, Tapie the politician will, if all goes to plan, die off and Tapie the filmstar will take his place to rub shoulders with show-biz glitterati at the Venice Film Festival, where the movie will compete for the Golden Lion.</p>
