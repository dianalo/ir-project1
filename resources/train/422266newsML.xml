<title>SINGAPORE: Asian crude firmer, little solace for Minas.</title>

<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-03-05</dateline>

<p>Asian crude prices were firmer on Wednesday with little movement seen in premium levels for regional or MidEast grades.</p>
<p>Traders said trading of MidEast crude for April was coming to an end, although there were a handful of cargoes available.</p>
<p>Light sweet regional grades were generally tight and were already being traded for April liftings. A producer sold 450,000 barrels of April Miri crude at OSP plus around five cents, traders said.</p>
<p>But heavy sweet grades remained under the cosh with Minas supplies still seen as ample.  </p>
<p>Traders reported that Pertamina was making efforts to push crude into storage to keep the market balanced because of the maintenance shut down of the 120,000-bpd Dumai refinery and the shut down of the 125,000-bpd Balangon CDU.</p>
<p>Some traders estimated that as much as one million barrels of Minas could still be available to the market and Pertamina might soon seek to make an official additional allocation.</p>
<p>Minas was still assessed at ICP less 50/60 cents after China paid those levels earlier this week for about 900,000 barrels.</p>
<p>But Duri was being talked at ICP less 20 to 30 cents after support from blenders and arbitrage talk.  </p>
<p>One trader has acquired various lots of Duri for blending at levels from ICP less 50 to 20 cents and another trader was heard buying Duri on a fixed-rate and floating-rate basis.</p>
<p>Tapis premiums were being talked lower, but the crude was considered difficult to value in premium terms over quoted prices, reflected in recent deals being done against the OSP.</p>
<p>Traders broadly assessed the differential at 75 cents to $1.00.</p>
