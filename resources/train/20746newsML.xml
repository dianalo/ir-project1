<p>Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal, blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring.</p>
<p>In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday, Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff, which Baghdad has to finance, surpasses funds allocated for electricity, water, sewers, education and agriculture.</p>
<p>At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food, medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>The Iraqi statement said the United States was &quot;interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraq's deputy ambassador, Saeed Hasan, noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted.</p>
<p>Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the U.N. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reports that arrangements are in place.</p>
<p>The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), which has to coordinate the distribution of food, medicine and other goods, increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States.</p>
<p>According to U.N. officials and diplomats, Iraq would have about $1.13 billion to spend for food, medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted.</p>
<p>The cost of the U.N. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $31 million.</p>
<p>In addition another $12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses, such as oil experts and administrative costs.</p>
<p>For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed 1,190 people, including 267 international staff and 923 Iraqi support staff.</p>
<p>Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces, no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government. Another 203 international staff and 325 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country.</p>
<p>There are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows, 32 customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts.</p>
<p>Yasushi Akashi, the DHA undersecretary-general, told the Security Council last week that the &quot;financial requirements to support the (humanitarian) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total...roughly 3 percent.&quot;</p>
