<title>UK: Oil markets ease on bearish IEA report and Iraq.</title>
<headline>Oil markets ease on bearish IEA report and Iraq.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>World oil markets eased slightly on Tuesday on a bearish report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and growing expectations of a resumption of Iraqi oil exports.</p>
<p>The world benchmark crude, North Sea Brent, was down four cents at $18.15 a barrel at 1245 GMT.</p>
<p>Thirsty U.S. markets guzzled more oil than expected this spring, helping to halt a dramatic slide in crude prices, but with inventories on the rise and Iraq close to resuming exports the reprieve will be brief, the IEA said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United Nations said it hoped to receive Iraq's food distribution plan in Baghdad by 2000 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The lack of an Iraqi distribution plan has held up the renewal of an oil-for-deal which allows Iraq to sell oil worth $2 billion over six months under U.N. supervision.</p>
<p>Despite sporadic demand for oil products and prospects of temporarily tighter North Sea supply next month, many oil traders and analysts are bearish about prices over the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;While demand growth is expected to remain strong, its impact on oil prices may be offset by rising stock levels,&quot; said the Petroleum Finance Company (PFC).</p>
<p>&quot;The final blow to prices however will be the rapid and concentrated resumption of Iraqi oil sales and the realisation of long-expected North Sea output hikes,&quot; said the PFC in its outlook for July to September.</p>
<p>The Asian market which has managed to prop up chronically weak Western markets this year is already beginning to show signs of faltering.</p>
<p>Last week Saudi Arabia slashed its crude prices to Asia where refinery profit margins have fallen to half their spring levels.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter how European and U.S. demand fares this summer, the bullish price impact of another potential surge in Asian demand could be offset by the sheer size of the increase in crude production,&quot; said the PFC.</p>
<p>Traders are eagerly awating the latest oil inventory data to be published later on Tuesday for the United States and on Wednesday for Europe.</p>
<p>Further gains in inventories of winter heating oil will be viewed as bearish.</p>
<p>Inventories are already running well above year ago levels in the West and many traders feel the market has over-anticipated winter demand.</p>
<p>Also looming over the market is a German plan to sell about 7.3 million tonnes of crude from storage to help the country meet strict EMU borrowing requirements.</p>
<p>Last month Bonn said it would decide whether to proceed with the plan by July 11 when the cabinet is due to approve a supplementary budget.</p>
<p>But the IEA, which acts as the West's oil watchdog, frowned on the plan, calling it &quot;unfortunate&quot;.</p>
