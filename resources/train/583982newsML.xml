<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares surged to another fresh high on Wednesday, supported by tamer-than-expected U.S. inflation data and a strong start to Wall Street trading.</p>
<p>The AEX index of leading shares came within a whisker of 800 points before easing, still ending at a record 796.86, up 10.83.</p>
<p>An intra-day high of 799.56 points supeceeded the previous peak of 792.21, reached on Tuesday, but the level could not be held for long and as the Dow eased so profit-taking here set in.</p>
<p>Dealers also reported heavy derivative-based selling as the index neared 800 points, accentuated by the expiry of May options due on Friday afternoon.  </p>
<p>&quot;It all started after the U.S. figures. We had a very good performance today,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>But the index should have another stab at 800 tommorow and break above before consolidating or even dropping back a little towards the 780-point level, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of buying power left in this market. I wouldn't be bearish, at least in the short term,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Most stocks ended positively, with financials leading the way. Dealers said a firmer domestic bond market and higher dollar overnight gave most stocks a firm early footing.  </p>
<p>Banking group ABN AMRO topped the volume list, ending 1.00 guilder up at 35.70, two days after a four-for-one share split.</p>
<p>It has earlier announced a further expansion in Asia, through the ABN AMRO Hoare Govett bid for 49 percent of Thailand's Asia Securities for 2.2 billion baht.</p>
<p>Vendex International said its turnover had risen by 35 percent in the first quarter of its 1997/98 book year, largely as a result of acquisitions. It also said shareholders had approved the previously announced separate listing of its Vedior services unit in London and Amsterdam.</p>
<p>The shares closed 3.10 guilders higher at 102.10.  </p>
<p>Publisher Wolters Kluwer surged 8.30 guilders to 238.80 on the back of heavy investor demand. With just 800,000 shares changing hands, there looked to be one major buyer, they said. Earlier in the day the company set its 1996 final stock dividend at one new share per 98 held.</p>
<p>Heineken was one of the few AEX shares, which showed lost ground, ending 10 cents weaker at 340.90. Some dealers attributed the weakness to a negative report in one Dutch newspaper on the beer market.</p>
<p>Philips pushing ahead to close 2.50 guilders up at 109.00.</p>
