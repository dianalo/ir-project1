<p>Iraq's deputy U.N. ambassador said on Tuesday the United States was hindering the implementation of an oil-for-food deal by insisting on too many monitors to supervise the plan.</p>
<p>But Saeed Hasan, in comments to reporters, did not say if these objections would jeopardise the plan, expected to be implemented early next month.</p>
<p>U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa, asked about implementation of the oil-for-food deal, said: &quot;We are chugging along nicely. We expect the secretary-general to be able to report soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Before the plan can go ahead, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali must issue a report giving the green light.</p>
<p>At issue is a May 20 agreement allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food, medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions that have been in force since August 1990 after Baghdad invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>About one third of the $2 billion is to be deducted for reparations and U.N. costs.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal to the United States to stop its intervention, which is unneeded, not fruitful, rather harmful and not constructive, to stop hindering the process of implementation of the memorandum of understanding,&quot; Hasan said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified,&quot; he said, adding that the number of monitors was up to the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) in consultation with Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;The number proposed now would use from the budget of humanitarian programmes an amount which supasses the money to be allocated for five-man humanitarian sectors -- electricity, water sewage, education and agriculture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Security Council president Tono Eitel of Germany, in answer to a query, said Iraq had not protested to him. &quot;It is more efficient to complain to you,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>DHA, at the insistence of Washington, called this month for about 260 monitors to supervise the export of oil and the import and distribution of humanitarian supplies, including the northern areas not under Baghdad's control. About 151 monitors are to be scattered throughout the rest of the country, the main point of contention with Baghdad.</p>
<p>Yasushi Akashi, undersecretary-general for DHA, has said the monitors, to be paid for by Iraq, would cost less than 3 percent of the $1.3 billion Iraq can spend on supplies from the oil deal over six months.</p>
<p>The United States was instrumental several weeks ago in delaying acceptance of an Iraqi food distribution plan until enough monitors were appointed. Last April it proposed last-minute amendments to the oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>The United Nations wants the deal to be implemented soon as oil flows must begin before food is imported and Iraq has not objected to the oil monitors. But the diplomats said if Iraq refuses to let the monitors into the country the Security Council's sanctions committee can block the importation of food at any stage in the process.</p>
<p>In Baghdad, the United Nations' new relief coordinator, Gualtiero Fulcheri of Italy, took up his post, replacing Mohamed Zejjari of Morocco. Diplomats in the Iraq capital said the number of U.N. monitors was bound to be a problem.</p>
