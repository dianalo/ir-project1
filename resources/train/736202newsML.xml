<headline>Folgers says no cut in retail coffee price.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Procter and Gamble Co. unit Folgers Coffee Co. said on Thursday it had no immediate plans to lower retail prices in the U.S., despite declining futures prices.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no news,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Folgers when asked about talk circulating about a retail price decrease.</p>
<p>Industry sources said rumors had been swirling around the coffee market that Folgers would cut the cost of a 13 ounce can of coffee by 40 cents, to $2.96, after the price of green coffee on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange slipped some 40 percent from 20-year highs in late May.  </p>
<p>While no U.S. coffee roaster has lowered its posted prices yet, analysts say decreases may not be far off if the futures prices stabilize near current levels. Since the price of the July contract surged to 318.00 cents on May 29, July has fallen as low as 182.00 cents -- a price not seen since mid-April.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be a surprise if they did go down,&quot; said one industry source. &quot;It's been trading long enough and low enough to go down.&quot;  </p>
<p>Folgers and other major roasters were forced to raise the retail price of a 13 ounce can of ground coffee four times since the beginning of the year from $2.41 to $3.36 to reflect the soaring cost of green coffee on the world's futures markets.</p>
<p>Tight supplies of arabica beans -- with inventories worldwide hovering near 20-year lows -- combined with a smaller crop in second-leading producer Colombia and the prospect of a reduced crop the top-grower Brazil in the 1997/98 seasson were some of the factors behind the sustained futures rally.  </p>
<p>But supply concerns have eased in the last month amid a production report from the USDA estimating Brazil would produce 28 million 60-kg bags of coffee in 1997/98 versus 27.5 million bags in the previous crop year.</p>
<p>Additionally, a mild winter in Brazil, where fears of frost typically spark buying, and a build-up in both CSCE certified coffee stocks and consumer coffee stocks in U.S. warehouses have contributed to futures downswing.</p>
<p>Some industry sources said, however, a cut in retail prices was unlikely with the Brazil still in the midst of winter.</p>
<p>&quot;They would have to be crazy to do something in July when we still have frost potential,&quot; said one coffee source. &quot;I think the earliest we'll see anything is at the end of this month of early August.&quot;</p>
<p>Industry sources also pointed out that much of the coffee currently being roasted was bought at much higher prices than seen recently on the futures market and that processors were still recouping the increase in costs.</p>
<p>&quot;Roasters fixed prices in the beginning of June,&quot; said another market source. &quot;Why go down now when you still have all that expensive coffee?&quot;</p>
