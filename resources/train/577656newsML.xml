<title>JAPAN: JGBs end easier on firm stocks despite strong yen.</title>
<headline>JGBs end easier on firm stocks despite strong yen.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Key June 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures closed easier on Monday, weighed down by firmer Tokyo stock prices, despite the yen's strength against the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;There were expectations earlier that a strong yen was a buy sign for JGBs, as it would hurt Tokyo stock prices. But stocks were not negatively impacted, which was a disappointment for JGBs,&quot; said a dealer at a &quot;Big Four&quot; brokerage house.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the exact market reaction, monetary authorities had hoped for,&quot; he said. The June posted a third day of losses and ended Monday down 0.06 at 123.39.  </p>
<p>The contract rose as high as 123.99 soon after the opening.</p>
<p>Its session low was 123.21. Turnover was 59,222 contracts.</p>
<p>In afternoon trade, comments from Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council, that a rise in Japan's interest rates would undermine the economy, provided brief support. But the rally was short-lived as the comments were seen as aimed at curbing the yen, rather than checking higher interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market reacted to Yamasaki's first comment. But later we realised his comments were aimed at curbing the yen's rise as he did not rule out a rate hike,&quot; a bank dealer said.  </p>
<p>Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Yamasaki said: &quot;If the level of interest rates is raised, it may increase consumption by individuals who receive interest income, but overall, I think it is reasonable to think that it (raising rates) would have a negative effect on the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the economy's recovery becomes full-fledged, raising interest rates will become possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said that in addition to fiscal and monetary policies, the economy can also be stimulated through tax policies.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 118.72/82 yen at 0655 GMT, after falling as low as 117.50 yen in morning Tokyo trade.  </p>
<p>It ended Friday's New York session at 120.20/30 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong yen would help Japan reduce its huge trade imbalance but its negative effect on stocks had been a headache for authorities,&quot; the first dealer said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 average gained 340.73 points or 1.72 percent to close at 20,143.51. It hit a morning low of 19,560.06.</p>
<p>A strong stock market would give the Bank of Japan greater flexibility in setting its monetary policy, traders said.</p>
<p>They said authorities were not worried about higher bond yields as banks would profit from the wider spread between interbank market rates and higher lending rates.  </p>
<p>The Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd is scheduled to announce its long-term prime rate for May later on Monday.</p>
<p>Bankers said the prime rate was expected to be raised to 3.1 percent in May from April's record-low 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Some traders said public funds may reduce JGB buying and increase lending as a result of the higher prime rate, which will push public-fund lending rates below those of private banks for the first time since May 1996.</p>
<p>The government's long-term lending rate has been at 2.6 percent since May 9.</p>
