<title>UK: SOCCER-REFEREE DANSON ADMITS HIS MISTAKE.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-REFEREE DANSON ADMITS HIS MISTAKE.</headline>

<p>Referee Paul Danson has admitted he was wrong to send off Sunderland's Paul Stewart against Arsenal at Highbury last week and the striker will now escape a one match suspension.</p>
<p>Danson, who had already sent off Sunderland defender Martin Scott for two bookable fouls in the same game, agreed to review the evidence of Stewart's dismissal at a weekend referees seminar with the Football Association and the League Managers' Association.</p>
<p>Stewart, who had already been booked for hand ball, repeated the offence, but claimed he was fouled in doing so by Arsenal's Steve Bould.</p>
<p>Now Danson has told the FA: &quot;It was a genuine mininterpretation on my part.&quot;</p>
<p>Sunderland, whose manager Peter Reid was also dismissed in the same 2-0 defeat by Arsenal for arguing with Danson about Scott's dismissal, has already been charged by the FA with bringing the game into disrepute.</p>
