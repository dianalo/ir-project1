<title>BELGIUM: Toy advertisers urge stronger EU action on limits.</title>

<p>Europe's toy manufacturers on Monday demanded stronger European Commission proposals to prevent what they allege are trade barriers to toy advertisements in the guise of advertising regulations.</p>
<p>&quot;These bans or restrictions, all of which are different or confined to individual member states, prevent the toy industry either from advertising its product at all in certain markets or from advertising them efficiently and at competitive cost,&quot; they said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Toy Manufacturers of Europe was commenting on a European Commission green paper aimed at creating a single market in the advertising sector in the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>Under the paper, restrictions would be assessed in relation to their &quot;proportionality&quot; to their stated aim -- notably protecting children.</p>
<p>The group said the proposals would not do anything to stop current restrictions imposed in Sweden, Greece, Flanders and Ireland.</p>
<p>Sweden bans television advertising to children below the age of 12 and Greece bans television advertising of toys to children during the hours when they are usually active.</p>
<p>The Belgian region of Flanders bans television advertising on either side of childrens' programmes and Ireland bans them in mid-afternoon advertising time by RTE.</p>
<p>TME says EU countries should recognise each others' rules on advertising and says that a time limit should be set for the EU to start EU infringement proceedings in cases where unfair trade barriers become evident.</p>
