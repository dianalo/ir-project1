<headline>German opposition leader slammed for EMU doubts.</headline>

<p>One of Germany's leading opposition Social Democrats (SPD) has come under heavy criticism, even in his own party, after calling for a postponement of the European single currency.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Free Democrat (FDP) coalition partners blasted Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder on Monday for saying he thought monetary union (EMU) should not be launched on schedule in January 1999.</p>
<p>Their statement echoed criticism that Schroeder, a possible SPD challenger to Kohl in the 1998 general election, heard from fellow Social Democrats over the weekend after expressing his doubts in an interview with the Bild newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;Keeping to the Maastricht criteria is an economic necessity,&quot; said Helmut Haussmann, the FDP's European affairs spokesman. &quot;Those who oppose this convergence course want to avoid reforms and flee into a policy of easy money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If Germany is not included, the whole thing makes no sense,&quot; Schroeder, a popular figure and the main rival to SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine, told Bild.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government is honest with citizens, then the way things stand today it must say: 'no matter how sorry we are, we will not achieve it by the planned date and are delaying the project',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Party colleagues flatly denied that the SPD, Bonn's main opposition, had turned against the idea of a single currency.</p>
<p>Hesse state premier Hans Eichel said Schroeder lived in a &quot;never-never land&quot; if he wanted a renewed debate over EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal must be that it happens, and that as many European states as possible take part in it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kohl's Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, joined in the chorus by calling Schroeder irresponsible.</p>
<p>The SPD fell on its face in March this year with a Euro-sceptical regional election campaign that even many Social Democrats said smacked of a right-wing &quot;D-mark nationalism&quot;.</p>
<p>Voters in Baden-Wuerttemberg drummed the SPD out of the coalition government after it tried to tap grass-roots fears about losing the mark.</p>
<p>The party seems keen to shake off this negative attitude towards further European integration. Earlier this month SPD European affairs spokeswoman Heide Wieczorek-Zeul said the planned single currency was Europe's best response against a dominant U.S. economy.</p>
<p>SPD chairman Lafontaine has said Germany should stick to the planned timetable for monetary union.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show at least two-thirds of Germans still oppose giving up the mark for what they fear will be a weaker Euro currency.</p>
<p>But just as many if not more trust Kohl to defend Germany's interests in the EU the best, and agree with him that European integration is more a political than an economic issue.</p>
