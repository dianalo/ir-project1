<p>While politicians and officials in Dhaka boast of wresting major tariff concessions from New Delhi, businessmen say they still worry about India's tough non-tariff trade barriers.</p>
<p>India recently offered tariff concessions ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent for 513 Bangladeshi products in an effort to narrow its yawning trade gap with its smaller neighbour.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that the concessions offered by India to Bangladesh will lead to substantially increased trade flows to India from Bangladesh,&quot; Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said earlier this month.</p>
<p>The tariff cuts are due to take effect next month following ratification by India's parliament, but Bangladeshi businessmen have expressed guarded enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&quot;The tariff concessions in reality won't mean much unless the non-tariff barriers are removed,&quot; said Yusuf Abdullah Harun, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Comemrce and Industry (FBCCI).</p>
<p>&quot;Definitely the offers can be a breakthrough for Bangladeshi exports. But their (India's) non-tariff restrictions are notorious and can spoil all prospects,&quot; said a top official of Dhaka's Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI).</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral, said during a recent visit to Dhaka that India would end all non-tariff restrictions on Bangladeshi imports.</p>
<p>Bangladeshi traders remain unconvinced.</p>
<p>&quot;The Indian government's goodwill is unparallelled. But we have seen in the past that what is made by the governments is unmade by their bureaucracy,&quot; the MCCI official told Reuters recently, speaking anonymously. &quot;Our fingers are often burnt.&quot;</p>
<p>BANGLADESHI COMPLAINTS</p>
<p>Bangladeshi exporters complain that Indian customs officials harrass importers with &quot;rules of origin&quot; and &quot;value addition&quot; requirements.</p>
<p>The MCCI official, who monitors India-Bangladesh trade, cited a recent case where an Indian merchant was heavily penalised for importing car batteries from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Indian customs) always try to find some flaws and make imports from us repulsive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>India's exports to Bangladesh, growing at an annual rate 20 to 25 percent, reached $1.2 billion in fiscal 1995/96 (July-June) while its imports from Bangladesh were $70 million.</p>
<p>Local trading sources claim another $2.0 billion worth of Indian goods are smuggled into Bangladesh a year, making the country India's fifth largest export source.</p>
<p>Dhaka businessmen are happy, however, that the concession list covers all important products in the highly competitive Indian market.</p>
<p>&quot;It could be a great opportunity for our exports and industry. Leather, melamine and ceramic table wares, ready-made garments, and electric bulbs have tremendous prospects,&quot; said the MCCI official.</p>
<p>He estimated Dhaka's exports might grow by a modest $20-25 million annually in the short term, and could reach up to $1.0 billion by the year 2,000 on expansion of production capacity.</p>
<p>LIKELY TO SPUR FOREIGN INVESTMENT</p>
<p>The FBCCI chief sees a salutary impact of the freer Indian market on the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>
<p>He said foreign companies hesitant to enter Bangladesh's small market would &quot;jump on having their production bases in Bangladesh if they get the opportunity to enter the huge Indian market of nearly one billion people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But again, all depends on how the Indian authorities will use the needles of extra-tariff bars,&quot; said an official of MCCI, which represents Bangladesh's organised manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Private companies here say India has maintained a protective trade regime while taking advantage of the liberalisation in neighbouring countries, particularly Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&quot;India's competitiveness is somewhat a myth. They protect their market and benefit from liberalisation in other countries,&quot; said the MCCI executive.</p>
<p>He referred to a recent study on competitiveness by MCCI and the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).</p>
<p>&quot;The study showed as many as 20 major consumer items such as ready made garments, leather products, ceramic wares, bulbs, etc, clearly have a competitive edge over identical Indian products,&quot; he said. &quot;We can prove it if they waive the restrictions.&quot;</p>
