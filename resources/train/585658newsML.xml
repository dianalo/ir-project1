<headline>Euro oil swaps - LS fuel jumps $3 but CFDs dip 10.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-15</dateline>

<p>European oil swaps were firmer on oil products on Thursday but Brent crude CFDs fell again.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel rose sharply with the spread between high and low sulphur swaps widening until the year ened.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. drove the one percent higher. There was very little demand in Europe,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Low sulphur climbed some $3 a tonne to $96 for June by late afternoon after trade at $16.55 a barrel ($104 a tonne) in the U.S.</p>
<p>Further forward the contango between the third and fourth quarters firmed to $6 a tonne at $87.50 and $93.50 respectively.</p>
<p>Low sulphur soared to $10 above barges on the front end due to the U.S. demand.</p>
<p>Gasoline rose 50 cents to $204.50 for June but July remained some $4.50 below June with August a further $3.50 lower.</p>
<p>Naphtha rose $2 a tonne to $188.50 for June and July with the third and fourth quarter cracks holding steady around $1.95 a barrel.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs slumped 10 cents to 27 cents under July for next week and 23 cents under, 19 cents and 20 cents under for the three subsequent weeks.</p>
<p>Jet premiums were little changed although June edged up 50 cents to near $20 above the IPE.</p>
<p>Gas oil crack spreads held at $4.30 a barrel (3Q97), $4.85 (4Q97) and $4.75 (1Q98). -- Sam Arnold-Forster, London Newsroom +44 171 542 4984</p>
