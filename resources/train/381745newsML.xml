<headline>LIFFE white sugar weaker at close, trade minimal.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-17</dateline>

<p>White sugar futures retained their earlier slight weakness in thin activity on Monday with a dearth of trading interest caused by the absence of the New York market.</p>
<p>The May/August spread attracted some dealing interest but almost all the day's turnover derived from trades on the spot May contract.</p>
<p>The market closed early at 1700 GMT to reflect the absence of the raws market due to President's Day. London white sugar volume amounted to just 464 lots.</p>
<p>May was down 80 cents at $303.80 and August down 70 cents at $303.90, maintaining the slight contango. Earlier, light selling was noted from Paris brokers using the London market, traders said.</p>
<p>Physical news was thin on the ground although details of Pakistan's recent white sugar purchases are slowly trickling out.</p>
<p>Thai trade sources said China bought 14,000 tonnes of Thai sugar for nearby shipment from Japanese trade house Mitsui. No details were available on price.</p>
<p>The vessel Jiang Chuan arrived at a Thai port for loading the sugar for shipment on February 15, they said.</p>
<p>No white sugar was tendered for delivery against the Matif March contract at close of business on Friday.</p>
<p>May was down 50 cents at $303.50 and August down 70 cents at $303.80. Matif volume totalled 247 lots.</p>
