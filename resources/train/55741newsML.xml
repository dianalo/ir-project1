<p>Datacraft Asia expects to maintain profit growth of at least 30 percent in the next financial year and in the near future, Des Althorp, Datacraft's chief executive officer and managing director, said on Monday.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at (30 percent profit growth) as a minimum. I don't see any changes at this point in time that would affect us to say to you that we will not be able to continue at the same level,&quot; Althorp told reporters at a briefing for the company's full-year results.</p>
<p>Datacraft earlier announced a 32.5 percent jump in its net profit to Singapore $9.08 million for the year to June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Althorp said Datacraft, a communications and network systems integration company, was aiming to raise the profit contribution from its business to telecommunication service providers to 45 percent from the current 40 percent.  </p>
<p>Althorp said he expected profit contributions from the company's support services to rise to 30 percent from 20 percent but said contributions from Datacraft's corporate business would fall to 25 percent from 40 percent.</p>
<p>He said Datacraft would open an office in the Philippines by the end of 1996 and aimed to have a presence in Korea, either through a joint venture or via a direct presence by June 1997. He said the company would target Vietnam and Japan after that.</p>
<p>He said Datacraft had no intention of going into markets further afield than the Middle East or Africa.  </p>
<p>Althorp said the company had signed a memorandum of understanding to provide its services to a U.S. GSM telephone provider. He declined to identify the company or give details of the contract, which he said would be announced later.</p>
