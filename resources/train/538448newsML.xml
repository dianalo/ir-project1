<p>UK spot natural gas prices saw a significant rise across the forward curve on Friday for the second successive day, with volumes once again far higher than have been seen in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's moved out of its ranges. Before, it had been stuck for two or three weeks,&quot; said a trader. &quot;As soon as it moves out, you've got to manage your position,&quot; he added, accounting for the huge increases in trade on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Prices were up across the board. The recent focus on the very prompt period appears to have waned, dealers said, but there was still some interest seen there, with deals done for within day, the day ahead, the weekend and Monday. But the number of deals done in the prompt period has come down.</p>
<p>Further forward, there were several trades done in Q3, as well as a number in Q1 98 and in summer 98. The gas year from October 1997 was also done at least twice at higher numbers. And one trader reported keen interest in the year from October 1998, although trade was not thought concluded by the close.</p>
<p>By contrast the IPE futures market was quiet again, with only 105 lots traded in four different months, although pries mirrored the physical market by rising across the board.</p>
<p>Transco forecast the temperature on Saturday at 9.9 Celsius against a seasonal normal 10.8 Celsius, and anticipates gas demand at 216 mcm, 50 percent of peak day demand.</p>
