<title>USA: US spot fuel oil mostly steady after recent slide.</title>
<headline>US spot fuel oil mostly steady after recent slide.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot residual fuel oil prices finished Friday mostly steady after their recent skid on weakening natural gas prices, little end-user demand and extended forecast of mild weather across much of the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we pretty much hit the bottom at this point,&quot; said one Houston-based dealer.</p>
<p>Most physical and paper resid values were supported by a rebound in crude prices, market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Crude is a little stronger,&quot; said an East Coast trader.</p>
<p>NYMEX March crude futures settled up 39 cents at $22.41 a barrel today after gaining 16 cents Thursday.  </p>
<p>NYMEX March Henry Hub gas futures continued their losing streak after a shortcovering rally fizzled.</p>
<p>The spot March contract settled down 3.3 cents at $1.966 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) after briefly breaching the key $2 resistance.</p>
<p>New York Harbor physical one percent held $16.38 a barrel, with March paper firmed to $16.40-60 from $16.00-15 Thursday.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour extended recent losses, down another 50 cents to $17.50-18.00. Other NYH sulphur grades stablized after falling Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>USG prices finished mostly unchanged from a day ago amid very light activity. One percent grade was still valued at $15.00-50 and three percent at $12.25-50.</p>
<p>Expected startup of two USG coker units this weekend provided psychological support for HSFO prices, traders said.</p>
<p>No USG and NYH deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate gas prices fell 15-20 cents to the $2.60/mmBtu level, near parity with NYH one percent resid mmBtu equivalent.</p>
