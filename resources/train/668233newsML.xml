<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end up, spots mixed.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end up, spots mixed.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-06-17</dateline>

<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market on the Shanghai stock exchange closed mostly up on Tuesday mainly due to a shortage of funds as the state banks retreat from the market, traders said.</p>
<p>But the annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract fell to 15.18 percent from 15.50 percent on a technical correction after sharp gains on Monday, which was due to a large number of new domestic A share issues, they said.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell to 2.6 million lots from 5.1 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 edged up to 109.69 yuan from 109.66 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market rose to 1.3 million lots from 1.2 million lots.</p>
<p>The contracts have been on a downward trend in the past few weeks partly due to the active stock markets sucking liquidity out of the spot market, but prices lack the momentum to fall much further, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they believed the spot contracts were likely to move narrowly around the current level in the next few days.</p>
