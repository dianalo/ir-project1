<p>Argentine utility Central Puerto, which ordered a new thermoelectric plant on Friday, is considering building yet another one to sell energy to Brazil, a top company official said.</p>
<p>&quot;A new plant just like the one we are ordering now ... is something we are definitely considering in a few more years,&quot; Central Puerto's general manager Luis Ceron told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Ceron made his remarks as a Brazilian newspaper reported that Brazil will begin buying power from Argentina in April.  </p>
<p>The report said Brazil will buy about 1,000 MW of electricity from Argentina to meet strong demand, O Estado de Sao Paulo daily said Tuesday, quoting federally owned utility</p>
<p>The Argentine seller was not identified in the newspaper report. Paraguay and Venezuela currently sell electricity to Brazil.</p>
<p>Central Puerto, run by Chile's Chilgener SA, Friday announced it ordered from General Electric and local conglomerate  Techint a $235 million, 769 MW combined cycle plant under a turn-key contract.  </p>
<p>The new Buenos Aires plant will go onstream in 1999 and will be over twice as large as originally planned. The deal replaces one signed in November by the same companies.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the expanded plans were good financing terms offered by GE and the prospect of exporting electricity to Brazil, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We more than double (the plant's) capacity, but the investment rises less than 70 percent,&quot; Ceron said.  </p>
<p>Ceron said that, including the plant ordered Friday, Central Puerto will maintain its position as Argentina's leading electricity supplier, with a 13 percent share of total demand and total installed capacity of 2,148 MW.</p>
<p>&quot;Had we kept the initial contract for the smaller plant, we would have been pushed to second place once the new Central Costanera plant became operational,&quot; Ceron said.  </p>
<p>Rival Central Costanera, controlled by a consortium headed by Chile's Endesa, last year ordered a combined cycle $280 million, 832.5 MW plant from Japan's Mitsubishi Corp, which is slated to go onstream in December 1998.</p>
<p>Ceron said the demand for electricity in Argentina is growing at a steady pace.</p>
<p>&quot;We think we should double capacity every 10 years. That means a seven percent annual growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added the firm was considering turning its gas-powered plant in the province of Neuquen in Patagonia into a combined cycle one, boosting capacity from 370 MW to 550 MW in 1999.  </p>
<p>Central Puerto has a 10 percent stake in a strategic alliance of eight Argentine utilities that last year launched a $275 million project to deliver cheaper electricity from Patagonia to Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>A 31 percent stake of Central Puerto is in the hands of Chilgener, another 31 percent is shared by Chile's Chilquinta and  Pacifico Quinta Region, while the rest floats in Buenos Aires and, in the form of ADRs, in New York.</p>
<p>Ceron said he saw electricity prices falling from $24 per MW per hour to $20-$21, considering Argentina's abundant, inexpensive gas resources and strong competition among many generators. Prices were about $50 in 1992.</p>
