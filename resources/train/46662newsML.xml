<headline>NYMEX electric futures fall amid ample hydropower.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures fell midday Wednesday amid a surplus of hydroelectricity being marketed in the western U.S., brokers and traders said.</p>
<p>Bonneville Power Adminstration (BPA) continued to offer daily power at competitive prices despite flagging regional power demand due to cooler weather.</p>
<p>BPA today expanded to sell non-firm, off-peak power for Thursday to the Southwest at $9.00 a megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>The pace of trading was lackluster because of an industry function in Houston and more focus paid by energy participants to the oil complex amid escalating U.S.-Iraq tension.</p>
<p>October California-Oregon Border (COB) futures were down 11 cents at $16.05 per MWh.</p>
<p>November COB was at $16.45, erasing a 15 cent loss. Other active COB months were nine to 15 cents lower.</p>
<p>October Palo Verde (PV) futures, the only active contract in that half of the complex, were down 25 cents at $16.40.</p>
<p>In the physical market, October COB was last quoted at $15.90-$16.35, and October PV $16.25-$17.00.</p>
<p>At 1210 EDT, NYMEX said 69 COB and five PV were sold.</p>
<p>On Tuesday's close, COB open interest stood at 3,247 contracts, up 17, and PV OI ended at 936, up eight.</p>
