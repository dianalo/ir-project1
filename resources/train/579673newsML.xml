<p>Germany's IG Bau construction workers' union and industry employers have agreed to top-level talks in a bid to avert a strike over wage and sick-pay disputes, the employer group said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The announcement that talks would be held came as both sides continued their war of words to establish parameters for a fresh round of talks aimed at bridging the differences and avoid the first wide-scale industry strike since 1950.  </p>

<p>No date for the talks has been set but officials said they would be held at short notice.</p>
<p>IG Bau has demanded its members receive 100 percent of sick pay benefits, while the pay-deal brokered by the arbitrator allowed for a payment of only 80 percent of normal wages in sick pay benefits for the first three weeks of illness.</p>
<p>Cutting back on the full payment of sick pay benefits to German workers has been at the centre of the dispute and was the chief reason why IG Bau's wages commission on Monday urged union leaders to reject an arbitration-brokered pay deal.</p>
<p>IG Bau also said that it would not consider a new pay deal brokered by the arbitrator, the Christian Democrat politician Heiner Geissler, and that Geissler could attend the talks only as a moderator, not as an arbitrator.</p>
<p>If a deal is not approved by May 21, IG Bau can lawfully call for industrial action.</p>
