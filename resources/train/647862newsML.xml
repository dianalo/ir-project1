<title>CYPRUS: Britain's David Hannay in talks on Cyprus divide.</title>

<p>Britain's envoy on the Cyprus dispute David Hannay started an intensive round of contacts on the divided island on Monday ahead of U.N.-sponsored settlement talks on the decades-old conflict next month.</p>
<p>Hannay had an hour-long meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and was later to cross the barbed wire dividing the island for talks with Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader.</p>
<p>Denktash and Clerides are to meet in New York on July 9, their first meeting in three years, to try to end the 23-year division of Cyprus. Last week U.S. President Bill Clinton appointed Richard Holbrooke, negotiator of the 1995 Bosnia peace accord, as special emissary for Cyprus.</p>
<p>&quot;What we were focussing on was how it should be possible for this negotiation process, when it starts, to bring what I call an early harvest, some progress to illustrate the credibility of the process but also to start to move things forward,&quot; said Hannay after meeting Clerides.</p>
<p>The British diplomat, who arrived in Cyprus on Sunday, qualified earlier statements about the existence of common ground in the positions of the two sides, saying he preferred the word convergence.</p>
<p>The Greek Cypriot-led government has stated that months of preparatory talks by the United Nations leading up to the July meeting have not managed to bridge the gap between the sides.</p>
<p>Turkish forces invaded northern Cyprus in 1974 after a brief Greek Cypriot coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece. Some 30,000 mainland Turkish soldiers are stationed in northern Cyprus, declared a breakaway state in 1983 but recognised only by Ankara.</p>
<p>A solution to the Cyprus dispute has been defined as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal state under agreements reached between the two sides in 1977 and 1979, but key differences remain on security, constitutional and territorial aspects.</p>
<p>A renewed push by the international community to resolve the Cyprus question comes against a backdrop of growing concern about increasing militarisation on the island and entry talks the Cyprus government is due to start with the European Union next year.</p>
