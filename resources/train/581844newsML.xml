<headline>FOCUS-DMG plays down equity departures.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-14</dateline>

<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank confirmed on Wednesday that its head of equities trading Ian Wace was leaving the bank.</p>
<p>But insiders dismissed suggestions that Wace's departure combined with those of two others in the equities division signified a more widespread malaise.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of people out there who want to see us fail, and when a couple of high profile people leave they are putting one and one together and making 500,&quot; one insider told Reuters.</p>
<p>Earlier DMG spokesman Markus Will confirmed a report in the Daily Telegraph which said Wace would leave the firm at the end of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;He is to leave the company at the end of the month on a very amicable basis,&quot; Will told Reuters, adding Wace was setting up his own consultancy business and would initially be working as a consultant for DMG.</p>
<p>Will also confirmed two other individuals -- Steve Bridle, head of continental European trading, and an analyst -- had both left DMG.</p>
<p>A replacement for Wace has yet to be appointed by Mike Philipp, global head of equities at DMG.</p>
<p>Banking sources said that some of the individuals who had been hired by DMG in its drive to build up its investment banking business were not happy in their roles and were looking for jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some of these were people who had moved to DMG from SBC Warburg and were now considering a return to the Swiss firm, they addded.</p>
<p>Sources at DMG also dismissed a suggestion in the Telegraph report that the equities division had not met profit targets and this had prompted Philipp's appointment from the markets division.</p>
<p>One said the equities business was meeting targets and added that the appointment of Philipp was good news for its future.</p>
