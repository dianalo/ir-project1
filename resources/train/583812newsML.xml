<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle early Wednesday were bid $68.00 per cwt again and passed by owners pricing cattle mostly at $70.00, with some at $71.00, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Bids were light, with packers a little more interested than Monday, but not as aggressive as had been expected, which had several feedyard managers speculating it could be another day before cattle trade in large numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;They're trying to buy 'em at $68.00, but it ain't going to happen,&quot; a Kansas cattle feeder said.  </p>
<p>Several feedlot managers said they could wait the extra day as cattle supplies were not a burden following nearly a month of active packer buying which left most lots extremely current.</p>
<p>Hefty cattle slaughter last week weighed on beef prices early this week, but the lower prices also found homes for the extra beef tonnage, sources said. Cattle slaughter last week was up 4.8 percent from the previous week at 737,000 head. Beef prices Tuesday were down $0.44-$0.99 per cwt, but fabricated beef sales at 531 loads for the week to date outran the previous week by 20.4 percent, USDA statistics showed.</p>
