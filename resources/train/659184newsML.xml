<title>GUATEMALA: British aristocrat murdered for money in Guatemala.</title>

<p>Authorities said on Friday they believe a British aristocrat stabbed to death in Guatemala City this week was murdered for his money.</p>
<p>Angus Colville, 58, brother of Viscount Colville of Culross, was returning to his hotel on foot on Tuesday when he was attacked and murdered, authorities said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe he was stabbed with one single knife wound to the chest,&quot; British Vice Consul Julie Johnson told Reuters. &quot;The body wasn't found with any money or credit cards so we presume the motive was money.&quot;</p>
<p>Colville was in Guatemala City alone, and might have been arranging a flight home after a boating holiday with friends, Johnson said.</p>
<p>Officials do not believe the attack had anything to do with his lineage. &quot;I'm sure the robbers weren't actually aware of who he was,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
<p>The body remained in Guatemala City on Friday while embassy officials worked to arrange shipment back to Britain and while police and Guatemalan authorities continued investigations, Johnson said.</p>
<p>Colville was from Tavistock in Devon. Viscount Colville lives in Suffolk, Embassy officials said, providing no other details.</p>
