<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer said Tuesday it was premature to start tax negotiations with the Clinton administration until Congress receives more information about the president's proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see how we can begin to talk about negotiating a tax bill until we have the specificity of their tax proposals so that they're subject to be scored by the Joint (Tax) Committee,&quot; Archer told reporters after speaking at a tax conference.  </p>
<p>Earlier in the tax conference, a White House aide had said it was hoped that the bipartisan working groups on five key issues including taxes could begin next week.</p>
<p>Archer said he was sending Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin a letter asking for more details on Clinton's proposed tax provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sending him (Rubin) a letter today because we had been hopeful any day up to now that that specificity would have been available to us,&quot; Archer said.</p>
<p>&quot;They've got to define their tax provisions. They can't just simply allude to them in generalities if we're to be able to get tax estimates on them,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Archer said he was &quot;extremely hopeful&quot; that a bipartisan balanced budget agreement would be reached this year, adding that there was &quot;good will&quot; on both sides.</p>
<p>He said he also believed that tax relief would be part of that budget accord and that he was hopeful there would be a broad-based capital gains tax cut included.</p>
<p>Archer said he believed that other tax proposals likely to be included in a final agreement would include expanding individual retirement accounts, helping families with a child tax credit and a measure to &quot;ameliorate&quot; the estate tax.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think all of those will be part of the ultimate tax package,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Archer said he hoped that negotiations with the administration would begin &quot;reasonably soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Archer also told reporters that he favored phasing out the subsidy on ethanol.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to try to prejudge what my (proposal) will be on the tax bill, but it would not be out of the ordinary for it to be in my (proposal),&quot; Archer said about phasing out the ethanol subsidies.</p>
