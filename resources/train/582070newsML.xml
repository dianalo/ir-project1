<p>The average yield and price at Wednesday's auctions of GKO discount Treasury bills and OFZ interest-bearing bonds was in line with the market level due to heavy demand in the form of non-competitive bids, dealers said.</p>
<p>The average yield on Tuesday was 28.05 percent.</p>
<p>TODAY</p>
<p>Finance Ministry sold:</p>
<p>*an additional tranche of 714-day bond (series 24012) at 98.24 pct average price</p>
<p>*182-day T-bill (series 22083) at 28.15 pct average yield</p>
<p>*total Finance Ministry proceeds were 7.30 trln rbls</p>
<p>Finance Ministry repaid</p>
<p>*about 7.18 trln rbls in maturing issue of 224-day T-bills (series 23052).</p>
<p>&quot;The Finance Ministry was very wise,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;Under conditions of uncertainty on the market, when many Russian operators expect prices to fall it announced an auction of a short-term paper, which is interesting for Russian investors.&quot;</p>
<p>The six-month paper on offer today compared with T-bill maturities of around one year at the last few weeks' auctions.</p>
<p>The demand for the T-bill came as a result of a big volume of cheap roubles on the interbank market and a significant Sberbank investment in the maturing issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knew Sberbank held significant sums in the maturing issue, which it usually re-invests, and that's why they put in non-agressive bids,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>IFCI deputy securities department head Andrei Koshchi said there remained about 2.5 trillion roubles for Thursday's trading, which was enough to push up prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an opinion that the market is overheated and many Russian participants cut their portfolios waiting for a correction, that's why we should expect growth in both short-term and long-term paper due to continuing non-resident demand,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
