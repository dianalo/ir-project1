<title>USA: Nearly one in ten U.S. residents is foreign-born.</title>
<headline>Nearly one in ten U.S. residents is foreign-born.</headline>

<p>Nearly one resident in ten in the United States was born in another country, and the percentage of foreign-born has been steadily increasing since 1970, new census figures released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>But contrary to popular opinion, the percentage of newcomers on welfare is not much higher than that of native-born Americans, even though many more of the foreign-born are in poverty, the Census Bureau report said.</p>
<p>It also indicated the American dream is still very much alive for immigrants. While recent arrivals were more likely to be in poverty, those who had been in the United States for over six years generally recovered from their financial difficulties, the report said.</p>
<p>Based on data released in March 1996, the Census Bureau said 24.6 million U.S. residents were born elsewhere, comprising 9.3 percent of the population.</p>
<p>The percentage of the foreign-born was even higher -- 14.7 percent -- in 1910. From that time it fell steadily all this century, hitting a low of 4.8 percent in 1970 before turning up again.</p>
<p>As a group, those born abroad had a much higher poverty rate than native-born Americans -- 22.2 percent compared with 12.9 percent.</p>
<p>But despite this high poverty rate, just 5.8 percent of the foreign-born were receiving some kind of public cash assistance. That compared to 4.5 percent of the native-born.</p>
<p>&quot;I was kind of surprised that the percentage receiving cash benefits was as low as it is considering how many are in poverty. It's kind of contrary to what the man in the street thinks,&quot; said Kristin Hansen, a Census Bureau researcher.</p>
<p>The longer the foreign-born were in the United States, the better they did financially. Those who arrived before 1970 had a poverty rate of 9.9 percent, making them actually less likely than natives to be in poverty.</p>
<p>About one third of the foreign-born population were naturalized citizens, but the report did not say what percentage of the rest intended to acquire U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>It said the data was primarily composed of legally admitted immigrants. Hansen said the bureau did not ask respondents whether they were in the United States legally.</p>
<p>More than one fourth of the foreign-born, or 6.7 million, were born in Mexico, and 10.5 percent were born on one of the Caribbean islands. Of the 50 states, California had the highest percentage of foreign-born, with 25.1 percent of its residents having been born abroad.</p>
