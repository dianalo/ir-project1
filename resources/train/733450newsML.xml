<headline>LATVIA-TEXT OF EU COMMISSION'S OPINION.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-07-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following are extracts from a summary issued on Wednesday by the European Commission of its opinion on Latvia's fitness to begin European Union membership talks:</p>
<p>Latvia submitted its application for membership of the European Union on 27 October 1995.</p>
<p>1. Political Criteria</p>
<p>Latvia's political institutions function properly and in conditions of stability. They respect the limits on their competences and cooperate with each other. Elections in 1992 and 1995 were free and fair, and in each case permitted the establishment of coalition governments. The Opposition plays a normal part in the operation of the institutions. Efforts to improve the operation of the judicial system and to intensify the fight against corruption need to be sustained.</p>
<p>There are no major problems over respect for fundamental rights. But Latvia needs to take measures to accelerate naturalisation procedures to enable the Russian speaking non-citizens to become better integrated into Latvian society. It should also pursue its efforts to ensure equality of treatment for non-citizens and minorities, in particular for access to professions and participation in the democratic process.</p>
<p>Latvia demonstrates the characteristics of a democracy, with stable institutions guaranteeing the rule of law and human rights.</p>
<p>2. Economic Criteria</p>
<p>In the first three years after independence Latvia's output declined by 50 percent. First signs of recovery in 1994 were undermined by a banking and budget crisis the following year; but growth turned positive again in 1996 (2.8 percent). Since 1995 the current goverwnent has conducted a tight fiscal policy, though revenue collection is still a problem. The foreign debt ratio remains low, but Latvia has a high trade deficit. Inflation rates have declined over recent years, but still stood at 17.6 percent in 1996. GDP per head is about 18 percent of the EU average, for a population of 2.5 million. The agricultural sector employs 18 percent of the labour force, and accounts for 9.9 percent of Gross Value Added. 45 percent of Latvia's exports qre directed to the EU, and 50 percent of its imports originate in the EU.</p>
<p>On the basis of its analysis, the Commission's judgment as to Latvia's ability to meet the economic criteria established at Copenhagen is as follows:</p>
<p>Latvia has made considerable progress in creating a market economy. Trade and prices have largely been liberalised. Much headway has been made in stabilising the economy. While there has been significant progress in establishing the legislative framework, effective implementation is lagging behind. Also, not all the necessary regulatory bodies are in place or working properly. Privatisation is not complete; the remaining state-owned companies are generally in poor financial condition and there is a shortage of investors.</p>
<p>Latvia would face serious difficulties to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium term. The Latvian economy is relatively open and labour costs are low. However, exports consist mainly of low value-added goods. Industrial restructuring, as well as enterprise restructuring, is still needed. The banking sector is underdeveloped and weak in parts. Agriculture needs to be modernised.</p>
<p>3. Capacity to take on the obligations of membership</p>
<p>Latvia's ability to take on the acquis has been evaluated according to several indicators:</p>
<p>- the obligations set out in the Europe Agreement (even though this has not yet entered into force for Latvia), particularly those relating to the right of establishment,</p>
<p>- national treatment, free circulation of goods, intellectual property and public procurement;</p>
<p>- implementation of the measures set out in the White Paper as essential for establishing the single market;</p>
<p>- progressive transposition of the other parts of the acquis.</p>
<p>Even before the Europe Agreement has entered into force, Latvia has made significant efforts to comply with some of the obligations which will come into effect with it. Latvia is meeting its obligations under the Free Trade Agreement, and according to the timetable for implementation set out in it. No serious bilateral problems have arisen.</p>
<p>Latvia has also made some efforts towards compliance with the essential single market legislation. It has made progress in the areas of banking, industrial property rights, conformity assessment and standards and commercial law. But further work needs to be done on intellectual property rights, public markets, personal data, competition (especially the transparency of state aids), taxation and other areas.</p>
<p>A problem for further progress may be the weakness of the Latvian public administration, which affects not only the pace of approximation of legislation but also the quality of its implementation and enforcement.</p>
<p>As for the other parts of the acquis, Latvia should not have significant difficulty in applying it in the medium term in the following fields: education, training and youth; research and technological development; telecommunications; audio-visual; fisheries; small and medium enterprises; trade and international economic relations; and development.</p>
<p>By contrast, substantial efforts will be needed in the fields of statistics and customs.  </p>
<p>Provided that Latvia maintains current positive trends towards industrial restructuring, its industry should be able to cope with integration into the single market in the medium term.</p>
<p>For the environment, very substantial efforts will be needed, including massive investment and strengthening of administrative capacity to enforce legislation. Full compliance with the acquis could only be expected in the long term and would require increased levels of public expenditure.</p>
<p>Latvia has made real progress in the field of transport, especially air transport. Provided efforts are made in road transport, rail and sea transport, no major problems are to be expected in applying the acquis relating to the single market. But investment will be needed to extend the European transport network so as to ensure that the single market functions well.</p>
<p>It should be possible for Latvia to achieve the employment and social affairs acquis in the medium term, provided that Latvia makes substantial efforts to adapt its legislation to EU requirements in fields such as health and safety and labour law.</p>
<p>Latvia has opted to pursue its regional policy within the framework of its national development strategy. Given the necessary administrative reforms, and establishment in parallel of effective systems of financial control, Latvia should become able to use the Union's regional and structural funds for its development effectively.</p>
<p>The agriculture sector needs restructuring, and only a limited number of the mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy currently exist. A substantial and sustained effort will be required to prepare for accession in the medium term.</p>
<p>In the energy field, Latvia has no nuclear power programme, and no difficulties are foreseen for Latvian compliance with Euratom provisions. But work will be needed to prepare to meet the acquis in the fields of energy pricing, access to networks, energy efficiency and environmental norms.</p>
<p>On the basis of the analysis of Latvia's capacity to apply the acquis, it is not yet possible to be sure when it could become able to take and implement the measures necessary to remove the controls at borders between Latvia and member states of the Union.</p>
<p>Latvia's participation in the third stage of economic and monetary union, which implies coordination of economic policy and complete liberalisation of capital movements, still poses problems in the medium term. It is premature to judge whether Latvia will be in a position, by the time of its accession, to participate in the Euro area. That will depend on how far the success of its structural transformation enables it to achieve and sustain pertnanently the convergence criteria. These are, however, not a condition for membership.</p>
<p>In the field of justice and home affairs, Latvia is starting from a low base and faces considerable difficulties in preparing itself. A major and sustained effort will be needed if Latvia is to be ready to meet the acquis in the medium term.</p>
<p>Latvia should be able to fulfil its obligations in respect of the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>In addition, Latvia has no major territorial disputes with any Member State or candidate country. Latvia has set development of good relations with Russia as a majc, - priority of its foreign policy, and has achieved important progress.</p>
<p>4. Administrative and legal capacity</p>
<p>For Latvia to have in the medium term the administrative structures necessary for the essential work of applying and enforcing the acquis effectively, there will need to be a major, reinforced effort of reform.</p>
<p>The same applies to Latvia's judicial system, which has an equally important role to play.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>In the light of these considerations, the Commission concludes that:</p>
<p>- Latvia presents the characteristics of a democracy, with stable institutions, guaranteeing the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. But measures need to be taken to accelerate the rate of naturalisation of Russian-speaking non-citizens to enable them to become better integrated into Latvian society;</p>
<p>- Latvia has made considerable progress in the creation of a market economy, but it would face serious difficulties to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union in the medium term;</p>
<p>- Latvia has made some progress in transposing and implementing the acquis relating particularly to the single market. With considerable further effort it should become able to participate fully in the single market in the medium term. Particular efforts, including investment, will be needed to apply the acquis fully in sectors such as environment and agriculture. Strengthening of the administrative structure is indispensable if Latvia is to have the structures to apply and enforce the acquis effectively.</p>
<p>In the light of these considerations, the Commission considers that negotiations for accession to the European Union should be opened with Latvia as soon as it has made sufficient progress in satisfying the conditions of membership defined by the European Council in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The reinforced pre-accession strategy will help Latvia to prepare itself better to meet the obligations of membership, and to take action to improve the shortcomings identified in this Opinion. The Commission will present a report no later than the end of 1998 on the progress Latvia has achieved.</p>
