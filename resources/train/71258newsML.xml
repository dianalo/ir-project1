<headline>F.O. LICHT - Daily sugar report.</headline>

<p>The following is a direct contribution from statistician F.O. Licht in Ratzeburg, Germany. Please address any queries to Helmut Ahlfeld on +00 49 4541 88920.</p>
<p>SUGAR - World market for September 20 - White sugar futures in London ended lower in quiet dealings. December finished at $328.50 per tonne, down $3.10, while March lost $3.00 to close at $338.60.</p>
<p>Raw sugar futures in New York ended a volatile session lower in technically- driven speculative liquidation. Traders said open interest remains high and speculators could have more positions to liquidate.</p>
<p>Apparently speculators have realized that no shortage is likely to develop given predictions of another surplus in 1996/97.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>USDA - According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) world sugar production in 1996/97 could reach 121.4 million tonnes while consumption was put at 119.5 million tonnes. However, USDA said the apparent surplus of 1.9 million tonnes disappears after adjustments for unrecorded trade.</p>
<p>The world production figure is up 1.2 million tonnes from the earlier forecast published in the June Situation and Outlook summary, and 1.5 million tonnes below the revised estimate for 1995/96.</p>
<p>US imports in 1996/97 should be 2.74 million tonnes, USDA said, making the United States the second top importer and at the highest level since 1983/84.</p>
<p>The Department recently set the sugar import quota for the 1997 fiscal year (October 1996/September 1997) at 2.3 million tonnes, with 1.7 million tonnes to be allocated immediately and the rest hinging on reviews set for January, March and May 1997.</p>
<p>The higher US import quota is expected to reduce western hemisphere raws availability and balance the expected increase in production.</p>
<p>MAURITIUS - Sugar exports in June 1996, the first month of the 1996/97 campaign (June/May), amounted to 4,786 tonnes, raw value, down from last year's 20,185 tonnes. Total exports in 1995/96 reached 565,608 tonnes against 525,697 tonnes in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Major countries of destination in 1995/96 were the United Kingdom with 497,944 tonnes raws against 461,513 tonnes and France with 20,468 tonnes, up from 4,864 tonnes.</p>
<p>Sugar production in June 1996 reached 11,176 tonnes, down from last year's 17,827 tonnes. Total production in 1995/96 amounted to 541,515 tonnes against 529,671 tonnes in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Total production in 1996/97 is expected to reach at least 640,000 tonnes which should also give a boost to exports. However, the large export commitments of the country prompted some imports in 1995/96 and this will also be the case in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Total imports in 1995/96 reached 38,086 tonnes of which 22,214 tonnes raws came from South Africa and 14,400 tonnes whites from the EU.</p>
<p>ITALY - Sugar imports in April 1996 amounted to 43,211 tonnes, raw value, up from last year's 20,584 tonnes. This brought cumulative imports in the first three quarters of 1995/96 (August/April) up to 281,756 tonnes against 155,351 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total imports in 1994/95 amounted to 266,279 tonnes against 218,678 tonnes in 1993/94.</p>
<p>Major countries of origin in August/April 1995/96 were France with 131,728 tonnes whites against 68,788 tonnes, Germany with 59,299 tonnes compared to 32,680 tonnes and the United Kingdom with 24,573 tonnes, up from 19,454 tonnes.</p>
<p>Sugar exports in April 1996 amounted to 1,477 tonnes which brought cumulative exports in August/April 1995/96 up to 144,649 tonnes against 121,701 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total exports in 1994/95 reached 124,787 tonnes against 182,179 tonnes in 1993/94.</p>
<p>Major countries of destination in August/April 1995/96 were Turkey with 31,970 tonnes whites against 1,254 tonnes, Lebanon with 23,351 tonnes compared to 24,391 tonnes and Syria with 14,834 tonnes against 13,505 tonnes.</p>
<p>IRELAND - Sugar exports in April 1996 amounted to 2,283 tonnes, down from last year's 6,490 tonnes. This brought cumulative exports in the first seven months of 1995/96 (October/April) up to 53,675 tonnes against 30,596 tonnes in the like period the previous year.</p>
<p>Total exports in 1994/95 amounted to 56,773 tonnes against 31,867 tonnes in 1993/94.</p>
<p>Major countries of destination in October/April 1995/96 were the United Kingdom with 26,037 tonnes whites against 23,981 tonnes and Israel with 10,733 tonnes, up from 3,999 tonnes.</p>
