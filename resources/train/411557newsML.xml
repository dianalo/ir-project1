<p>Fidelity Investments said Thursday net cash flows into its domestic equity funds totalled about $2 billion in February.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect about $2 billion in domestic equity net sales in February. Investors remain enthusiastic with domestic equity funds with the stock market reaching new records this month,&quot; Fidelity spokeswoman Robyn Tice said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, the Investment Company Institute reported that cash flows for January in domestic stock funds hit record levels, totalling about $29.39 billion. That beat the previous record of $28.9 billion for January, 1996.</p>
<p>Cash flows into Fidelity's domestic equity funds totalled more than $2 billion in January, Tice said.</p>
<p>Among the most popular stock funds this month were Fidelity Growth &amp; Income, Fidelity Contrafund, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock and Fidelity Select Brokerage and Investment Management, she said.</p>
<p>Tice said cash flows for Fidelity's international stock funds turned flat in February after being positive in January.</p>
<p>Bond funds were slightly positive in February and money market funds were very strong, expected to top $1 billion in cash inflows, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Money markets were very strong, driven mostly by institutional customers,&quot; she said.</p>
