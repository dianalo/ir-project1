<p>SUGAR - World market for January 31, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London closed higher helped by firmer physical demand for whites. March added $1.90 to close at $303.30 per tonne, while May ended $1.20 higher at $298.60 per tonne. In New York raw sugar futures closed mixed with front month March adding 6 points to close at 10.45 cents/lb. May added 1 point to close at 10.41 cents/lb, while the outer months lost 1 point. Early gains were not sustained as disappointed speculators liquidated positions and the trade sold near the close. Traders said fund buying in the March/May contracts and trade buying in the spreads gave the market an early boost. However, fundamentals remain negative with no major rally in sight.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>RUSSIA - According to official sources sugar beet production in 1996 reached 16.132 million tonnes, up from earlier estimates of 14.9 million tonnes but down on last year's figure of 19.1 million tonnes. The largest producing area, the Central-Chernozem, harvested 7.188 million tonnes of sugar beet in 1996 followed by the North Caucasus area with 4.735 million tonnes and Krasnodar Krai with 3.768 million tonnes.</p>
<p>EUROPEAN UNION - In its estimate of January 29, the EU Commission raised its forecast for beet white sugar production in 1996/97 to 16.168 million tonnes, up from the previous estimate (December 18) of 15.923 million tonnes and last year's production of 15.636 million tonnes. However, even the latest production estimate could be on the low side. In our second estimate of world sugar production 1996/97 we had put EU beet sugar production at 16.384 million tonnes, white value, up from 15.643 million tonnes the previous year. The Commission said that of the total expected to be produced in 1996/97 11.707 million tonnes are likely to be A-quota sugar, 2.435 million tonnes B-quota sugar and 2.988 million tonnes C- sugar. It is expected that the total carried over into 1997/98 will be 900,000 tonnes, so that C-sugar exports are likely to reach 2.088 million tonnes, up from 1.636 million tonnes the previous year. The total sugar available for export (quota and C-sugar) is put at 4.836 million tonnes, up from 4.443 million tonnes the previous year. Given the difficult situation on the Community's export markets it remains to be seen, whether the total quantity can be sold.</p>
<p>ROMANIA - Sugar imports in November 1996 amounted to 68,287 tonnes, raw value, up from last year's 22,673 tonnes. This brought cumulative imports in the first quarter of 1996/97 (September/November) up to 131,776 tonnes compared to 41,390 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total imports in 1995/96 reached 327,159 tonnes against 275,178 tonnes in 1994/95 and 293,257 tonnes in 1993/94.

Sugar exports in September/November 1996 were negligible.</p>
