<title>USA: GTE profits grow as revenues surge.</title>
<headline>GTE profits grow as revenues surge.</headline>
<dateline>STAMFORD, Conn. 1997-07-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>GTE Corp. said Wednesday that its profits grew by almost 5 percent in the second quarter as revenues surged.</p>
<p>The regional telephone giant said its net income for the three months ended June 30 expanded to $671 million, or 70 cents a share, from $642 million, or 66 cents a share.</p>
<p>The earnings per share were right in line with Wall Street expectations. Analysts had forecast the company would report earnings of 70 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Total revenues for the quarter grew by 7.5 percent -- a five-year high -- to $5.69 billion from $5.29 billion.</p>
<p>The company said its results were reduced by about $28.7 million, or 3 cents a share, for costs related to acquisitions and other strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>GTE, which offers local telephone and wireless service in 29 states and long-distance service in all 50 states, said its revenue gain was fuelled by growth in its core telephone and wireless services, combined with new and expanded services.</p>
<p>&quot;These results not only reflect the strength of our markets, but also our ability to respond to our customers with new and expanded service offerings, such as long distance, and to bundle them together on a single bill,&quot; Chairman Charles Lee said in a statement.</p>
<p>GTE, which began marketing long distance services largely to its local customer base in March 1996, said it had 1.3 million long distance customers at the close of the second quarter -- an increase of 1 million since last June 30.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, GTE acquired Internet service provider BBN Corp. for about $616 million, purchased vast additional fiber optic capacity from Qwest Communications International Inc. and forged a strategic alliance with data networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.</p>
<p>These initiatives were designed to enable GTE to become a national supplier of integrated voice and data telecommunications services, the company said.</p>
<p>GTE said it sustained 8 percent growth in the number of its customers' access lines. It also said it had 25 percent more customers ordering second phone lines than a year ago.</p>
<p>For the first six months of the year GTE said its net income grew by 6.2 percent to $1.34 billion, or $1.39 a share, from $1.29 billion, or $1.29 a share.</p>
<p>Revenues expanded by 7.1 percent to $10.97 billion from $10.24 billion.</p>
<p>GTE's stock edged up 31 cents to $47 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
