<p>Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth Tuesday outlined a five-year plan to balance the budget that he said would permit a $143 billion net tax cut through 2002 and would contain a 1.1 percent downward adjustment in the consumer price index.</p>
<p>In a statement, Roth said his plan would include $321 billion in deficit reduction over the five years, $70 billion more than proposed by President Clinton. The White House plan included a net $22 billion tax cut -- $98 billion in tax reduction offset by $74 billion in taxes raised by closing loopholes and extending current taxes.  </p>
<p>Roth's proposasl was designed to counter suggestions from other Republicans, chiefly House Speaker Newt Gingrich, that tax cuts should be postponed until the budget is balanced.</p>
<p>&quot;The notion of having to choose between balancing the budget and delivering tax relief is a false choice,&quot; Roth said. &quot;We need tax policies that will create economic growth incentives and we need to restrain government spending with common sense policies, not gimmicks. We can and should do both at the same time,&quot; the Delaware Republican said in a statement.</p>
<p>Roth's budget would include smaller savings on defense over the five years -- $70 billion versus $80 billion sought by Clinton. It would include larger savings from changes in domestic programs, Medicare and Medicaid health programs and would expect interest payments on the federal debt to be smaller.</p>
<p>His tax cut proposal would total $178 billion, to be partially paid by $30 billion from extension of the airline ticket tax and $5 billion in unspecified tax increases.</p>
<p>It would not allow any of the spending increases sought by Clinton for Medicare or Medicaid.</p>
