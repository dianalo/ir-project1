<p>Implied volatilities for dollar/yen options firmed in relatively thin U.S. business as the spot dollar dipped below 114 yen, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Vols are bid on all the spot moves after the numbers came out,&quot; said a U.S. bank trader in New York, referring to choppy trading after a weaker than expected June U.S. jobs report.</p>
<p>June non-farm payrolls rose 217,000 against an average estimate of a 222,000 gain and May's 166,000 rise.</p>
<p>The trader said out-of-the-money yen calls remained steeply priced over equivalent yen puts, keeping risk reversals sharply skewed.  </p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen implied volatility stood at 10.4/10.6 percent at U.S. midday, up half a point from late Wednesday levels. The curve was mostly flat, with some inversion in the back end as one-year was little changed at 10.2/10.4 percent.</p>
<p>One-month 25-delta risk reversal widened back out to 2.4/2.7 point, just short of a 2.75 high earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Traders noted that dollar/yen and sterling/dollar volatilities were bid as risk perception had centered on the dollar's downside. By contrast, dollar/mark volatilities were subdued as the greenback slipped after touching a fresh 40-month high of 1.7566 marks.  </p>
<p>One-month cable rose to 8.1/8.4 percent from Wednesday's 7.4/7.7, and one-month dollar/mark shed more than a quarter point to 8.0/8.3 percent. One-month sterling/mark rose to 9.8/10.1 percent from 9.2/9.6.</p>
<p>A lack of a breakout-type behavior in spot or aggressive bids in volatilities was making dollar/mark's rally look tentative, even though the greenback has ground up to new highs each day this week, some market-watchers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's beginning to look like a (broadly) weaker dollar may become a little bit more realistic,&quot; Alan Revercomb, options strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we do get a dollar/mark breakdown here, it starts to be perceived as an overall dollar bear move,&quot; he said. &quot;That's probably when you get volatilities to spark back to life.&quot;</p>
<p>The one-month correlation of spot dollar/mark and dollar/yen was starting to return to normal levels in the 0.6-0.8 area after being unusually low in the past few months, he said. The three-month correlation was still near zero.</p>
<p>Revercomb said a broad dollar decline would probably be led by a breakout in dollar/yen, whose daily chart was forming a triangle-like pattern that was approaching its apex. He saw the 113.20-yen area as a critical level near term.  </p>
<p>However, should the dollar hold its recent ranges next week, resolution of the market's current abnormalities could come in the form of a stagnation, traders said.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen's stubborn skew in risk reversals might relent if the dollar does not threaten the lower end of recent ranges, Revercomb noted. He said dealers' short-gamma exposures in the downside strikes would go away as one-month options bought heavily in early June gradually expired.</p>
<p>Still, those short positions would start biting and destabilize the market if the dollar fell, making the yen calls gamma-rich at-the-money short-dated options.</p>
