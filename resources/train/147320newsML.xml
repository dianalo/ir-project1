<p>Two top National Bank of Hungary (NBH) officials offered to resign after disclosure of an unfavourable foreign exchange contract that could cost the NBH more than three billion forints ($19 million), newspapers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The reports of a huge loss in a government contract came hard on the heels of a scandal over payments of millions of dollars to a consultant at the state privatisation agency APV Rt. That revelation led to the dismissal of the entire APV board and the minister in charge.</p>
<p>NBH vice presidents Frigyes Harshegyi and Sandor Czirjak offered their resignations over the contract with Creditanstalt which the NBH concluded in 1992, the daily Nepszabadsag said.</p>
<p>The latest contract was for foreign exchange rate guarantees maturing in 1998 that forced the NBH to create substantial risk reserves that have proven extremely costly, the newspaper reports said.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Elemer Kiss told the daily Magyar Hirlap that Prime Minister Gyula Horn was likely to decide on Monday what action he would take.</p>
<p>An internal report by the NBH said &quot;a professional mistake was made&quot; by those responsible for the contract and added that Czirjak and Harshegyi were &quot;personally responsible&quot;.</p>
<p>The government discussed the report last week in a cabinet meeting and said that although the two vice presidents had worked effectively at the bank, action must be taken.</p>
<p>Officials at Creditanstalt were not immediately available for comment. ($1=159.24 Forint)</p>
