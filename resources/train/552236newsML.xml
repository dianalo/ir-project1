<p>Oil and gas explorer and producer Petroz NL said on Wednesday it may need to raise capital to fund part of its share of the Undan/Bayu development, but said any raising would not be large.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe there will be a need for some portion of new equity, but it won't be a devastating amount,&quot; Petroz managing director Rod Brown told a Securities Institute of Australia address.</p>
<p>Brown said Petroz's share of the cost of developing the Timor Sea field would be about A$150 million for the liquids project and A$100-A$150 million for an additional LNG project.  </p>
<p>Brown said he did not believe Petroz, which is currently debt free, would have any difficulty funding the project.</p>
<p>A large part would be project financed and banks had already been &quot;knocking on our door&quot;.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller participants might band together to get cheaper project finance, he added.</p>
<p>Petroz would also have a projected cash flow of about A$20 million a year from the development of the nearby Elang-Kakatua fields in 1998.  </p>
<p>Brown later told reporters that any capital raising would not be large relative to Petroz's market capitalisation, currently around A$226 million.</p>
<p>First liquids production at Bayu-Undan was expected about mid-2001, while a longer development period for the LNG project would see it come on stream about a year later, assuming no delay in securing markets, he said.</p>
<p>BHP holds a 42.417 percent stake of the ZOCA 91-12 Undan permit, while Phillips Petroleum Co, leads the ZOCA 91-13 Bayu consortium with a 60 percent stake.  </p>
<p>The participants in ZOCA 91-12 besides BHP are Santos Ltd with 21.426 percent, Indonesia's Inpex Sahul with 21.209 percent and Petroz with 14.948 percent.</p>
<p>In the adjacent ZOCA 91-13 permit, the other participants besides Phillips are Oryx Energy Co with 25 percent and Hardy Oil &amp; Gas Plc with 15 percent.</p>
