<title>UK: Both Brent dates kept - trade.</title>
<headline>Both Brent dates kept - trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The two Brent cargoes nominated from the paper chains on Tuesday were both kept ahead of the five o'clock deadline, traders said.</p>
<p>One cargo was kept by BP and the other by Stasco, they said.</p>
<p>The cargoes are due to load March 19-21. One was a full cargo from the original loading programme and the other was put together from top-ups.</p>
<p>Brent cargoes are traded on a paper, or forward market until the 1700 London time deadline on the nearest trading day 15 days before their assigned loading date.</p>
<p>A trading company is clocked when it is left with a paper cargo which has turned physical after that deadline and therefore cannot be passed on as part of pre-sold paper cargo deals.</p>
