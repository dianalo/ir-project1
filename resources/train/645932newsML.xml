<p>French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has ordered his new government to keep mum on its plans and priorities until he has delivered his formal message to parliament later this month, aides said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;When will we see the new programme? When Lionel Jospin spells them out before the National Assembly, most likely on June 19,&quot; Francois Hollande, senior Socialist Party official, said in a broadcast interview.</p>
<p>France and world financial markets are eager to learn what the new leftist government, swept into power in last Sunday's parliamentary election, has up its sleeve.</p>
<p>But new government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann told Radio Luxembourg people would just have to be patient for a while longer, as Jospin had warned ministers against leaks until the programme had been agreed and unveiled.</p>
<p>Traditionally, new prime ministers present their programme in a formal policy statement to parliament, followed by a vote on a motion of confidence in the new government.</p>
<p>Trautmann said the June 19 date widely mentioned for the speech had yet to be confirmed by Jospin.</p>
<p>Jospin, in a visit to the southwestern village of Cintegabelle, confirmed he would call a special cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss the governmment's priorities in preparation for the speech.</p>
<p>Trautmann said Jospin's positions on several key economic and European questions could not yet be disclosed because they would depend on talks he planned this week with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and perhaps British Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>
<p>Those questions included crafting a new French approach to European monetary union and whether to renegotiate a stability pact on fiscal discipline after the shift to a single European currency.</p>
<p>The great exception to the rule of silence was new Environment Minister Dominique Voynet, who spoke to the news media of some of her plans at the weekend.</p>
<p>She said she wanted to scrap the costly Rhine-Rhone canal project and permanently shut down the troubled Superphenix nuclear fast breeder reactor.</p>
<p>The 60-billion-franc ($10.3 billion) reactor has been plagued by problems since it was built 20 years ago, and environmental groups have branded it a costly and dangerous dinosaur.</p>
<p>The planned 230-km (140-mile) Rhine-Rhone canal, designed to accommodate barge traffic from the Rhine River where it passes by the eastern city of Mulhouse to the Saone River near Saint-Jean-de-Losne, would cost an estimated 50 billion francs ($8.6 billion) to build.</p>
