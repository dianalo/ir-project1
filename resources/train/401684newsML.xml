<p>Shares at Bombay bourses ended Tuesday little changed from their previous close and near the day's lowest levels, indicating a weak market undertone, traders said.</p>
<p>Petrochemical major Reliance Industries rose 6.0 rupees, or 2.35 percent, to 261.75 rupees, above the intra-day low of 253.75, on renewed speculative purchases, they said.</p>
<p>After a weak start, the Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) benchmark 30-share index surged nearly 1.25 percent in mid-session on buying support before dropping on profit-taking to end with a net loss of 3.20 points, or 0.10 percent, over Monday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess people wanted to square off oustanding positions. The market mood still remains confused,&quot; said Piyush Vora, a member-broker of the BSE.</p>
<p>The government on Tuesday gave its economy mixed grades and said more free-market reforms were needed to compete with developing powerhouses like China. Releasing the annual Economic Survey, the government said infrastructure bottlenecks, rising inflation and sluggish exports clouded a seven percent average annual growth rate which placed India among the top 10 economic performers in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Indicators are mixed,&quot; it said succintly.</p>
<p>Market participants said speculation ahead of the budget led to choppy trading. &quot;There is a lot of uncertainty about what the budget would contain. There are too many constraints on the government,&quot; said Sanjay Vaid, chief dealer at local firm Lloyds Securities.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram presents the 1997/98 budget (April-March) on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said foreign funds mostly stayed on the sidelines, with local speculators dictating price trends. SBI rose 0.50 rupees to 274.0, but ITC was down 5.50 to 388.75.</p>
