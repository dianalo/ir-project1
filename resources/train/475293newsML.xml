<p>Two weeks after Moslem-Buddhist unrest broke out in Burma, armed troops still guarded religious sites on Saturday although the military government had lifted some restrictions, residents said.</p>
<p>Security measures near some monasteries and mosques in mixed communities across Rangoon remained tight, with armed troops in the street and military trucks parked nearby, they said.</p>
<p>In Yankin township where the first attack on mosques took place in Rangoon more than 10 days ago, security personnel were seen being reinforced late on Friday with many trucks and some fire engines.</p>
<p>Some eyewitnesses said they saw a prison car nearby.</p>
<p>Witnesses last week said about 100 monks had been detained by authorities following attacks on mosques and street demonstrations. They said the monks were taken to an unused racecourse in Rangoon, which in the past has been used to detain people arrested during unrest.</p>
<p>The military goverment has not commented on the reported detentions nor on the whereabouts of the monks.</p>
<p>In Burma's second city Mandalay, where trouble began on March 15 when monks went on a rampage and attacked several mosques, tensions were easing slightly as the government removed some restrictions, residents said.</p>
<p>The central Mandalay Zaygyo market was reopened on Friday after being closed by the government since March 17.</p>
<p>But some streets were still barricaded and an 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew was still in place in several townships.</p>
<p>The exact cause of the unrest is not known. The government said it was sparked in part by the rape of a young Buddhist girl by a Moslem. Others say it happened following reports of vandalism of an important Buddha image in Mandalay.</p>
<p>The government last week said the unrest was political in nature, orchestrated by people who wanted to disrupt the stability of the nation.</p>
