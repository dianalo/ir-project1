<p>British leisure and brewing group Whitbread Plc said on Wednesday that it has bought the BrightReasons group for 46 million stg in cash with a further potential payment payable on the sale of Pizza Piazza.  </p>
<p>BrightReasons group consists of 180 pizza and pasta restaurants. Whitbread said it would sell Pizza Piazza as a going concern.</p>
<p>&quot;The attraction of the business is that it gives us a large number of sites, as well as the Bella Pasta brand which we intend to expand,&quot; David Thomas, managing director of Whitbread Restaurants &amp; Leisure Division, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Whitbread already owns Pizza Hut, Britain's largest pizza chain in a joint venture with PepsiCo.  </p>
<p>The deal was widely expected by investors and analysts as part of the company's drive to meet its ambitious plans for opening new Cafe Rouge and Costa Coffee outlets.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of 46 million pounds is probably nearer 43.5 million if you take into account money that is already in the restaurant tills,&quot; said one analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>The company confirmed it was in talks with BrightReasons on November 1. BrightReasons was put up for sale this month by venture capital groups Morgan Grenfell and Mercury Asset Management, which hold some 86 percent of it.</p>
<p>BrightReasons includes the Pizzaland, Bella Pasta and Pizza Piazza brand names. Pizzaland was acquired by a management team led by Michael Guthrie from Grand Metropolitan five years ago, with venture capital backing.</p>
