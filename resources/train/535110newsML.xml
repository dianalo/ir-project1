<p>Poland is likely to pass three major laws as part of its pension reforms before this year's general election, but other bills relating to the vital reform will have to wait, the prime minister said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said parliament, in which his Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) is the main party, was likely to approve two bills on creating new pension funds and one on using the proceeds from privatisation to finance the reform.</p>
<p>&quot;I am deeply convinced that there is no threat for the government's pension funds plan,&quot; Cimoszewicz told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>&quot;I have been informed that a kind of informal agreement has been reached between the government coalition and part of the opposition about the method of work (on the reform).&quot;</p>
<p>The three bills will lay the groundwork for the reform of the inefficient pay-as-you-go system inherited from the pre- 1989 communist era by gradually increasing the dependence of benefits on contributed premiums.</p>
<p>Poland also has yet to redraw rules on how the benefits would be paid out.  </p>
<p>But asked if it would not be too difficult during the election year to pass bills on such sensitive issues as the pension privileges enjoyed by farmers, the military and the police, Cimoszewicz said: &quot;That is why we are not proposing them.&quot;</p>
<p>The bills, necessary in the longer term, can wait, since the new pension funds are likely to be created no sooner than in 1999, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that we are not occupied with this does not pose a threat to the core of the reform,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the reform, new pension funds would get part of obligatorily premiums now paid the state-owned Social Security Office (ZUS). ZUS' bigger deficit would be bridged with revenues from privatisation.</p>
