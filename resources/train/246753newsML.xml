<p>NATO fixed a date on Tuesday for a historic summit to invite former communist enemies to join the alliance, but sought to deflect Russian anger by pledging not to station nuclear weapons on the territory of new members.</p>
<p>NATO foreign ministers also backed a plan to send a new peacekeeping force to Bosnia for 18 months and lambasted Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for failing to respect the results of November's municipal elections.</p>
<p>Officials said leaders of the 16 alliance member states would gather at a special summit in Madrid next July 8-9 to invite certain countries to begin accession talks.</p>
<p>Stressing that enlargement was non-negotiable, they said they hoped Russia would start talks on a new wide-ranging NATO-Russia charter which could be signed at the same meeting.</p>
<p>First signs from Russia gave little ground for optimism that a breakthrough was at hand.</p>
<p>Shortly before Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov flew from Moscow to attend the second day of the two-day Brussels meeting, Moscow dismissed suggestions it was softening its opposition as &quot;fantasy&quot;.</p>
<p>NATO officials stressed that Russia had agreed to take part in a Stabilisation Force (SFOR) taking over from the alliance's current peace-keeping contingent in Bosnia on December 20.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope we can build on that cooperation on the ground to convince them enlargement is no threat,&quot; a NATO envoy said.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise they are in a difficult position, they cannot appear to accept that enlargement is going ahead,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to send between 25,000 and 30,000 troops to monitor the Balkan state's peace accords next year, but said the force would leave at the end of 18 months.</p>
<p>&quot;From now on, the destiny of the Bosnians will be more and more in their own hands,&quot; French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said.</p>
<p>NATO, which has spent the last year policing the Dayton peace accords on Bosnia, &quot;strongly deplored&quot; Milosevic's cancellation of local election results in Serbia last month.</p>
<p>A NATO statement issued shortly after the start of the meeting also praised the restraint of the Serbian opposition, which has mounted peaceful mass protests against the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;We commend the opposition for its adherence to non-violence and call upon the government to avoid any use of force against the peaceful protestors,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>An opposition coalition claimed widespread victories in Yugoslavia's November 17 municipal elections, winning control of Belgrade and 14 other major cities. But a Serbian court cancelled the results and Milosevic has shown no sign of reinstating them.</p>
<p>In an apparent attempt to lessen Moscow's opposition to enlargement, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the alliance had no plans to station nuclear weapons on the territory of Moscow's former allies.</p>
<p>&quot;In today's Europe NATO has no intention, no plan and no need to station nuclear weapons on the territory of any new members,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials said the ministers had agreed to start work on drawing up a shortlist from 11 countries now clamouring to join the alliance.</p>
<p>Negotiations and ratification by current member states could take up to two years, but the aim is to have the first new members for more than two decades inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) by its 50th anniversary in 1999.</p>
<p>Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are currently favourites to be first through the door.</p>
