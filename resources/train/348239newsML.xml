<title>DENMARK: Danish shares at new peak, progress depends on Dow.</title>
<headline>Danish shares at new peak, progress depends on Dow.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices hit record highs once again on Friday and dealers saw gains continuing on Monday if the Dow held early advances.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been an exceptionally fine (Danish) market today, Denmark has been one of the best performers in Europe. If the Dow Jones can hold its gains at around 0.5 percent it can strengthen this market further on Monday,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The Danish KFX top-20 index closed 2.45 points up at 147.88 in busy overall bourse turnover of 1.66 billion crowns. Its March future rose 2.10 point to 147.00 with 100 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Tele Danmark was the day's most traded share, with turnover of 375,000 and a rise of 10 crowns to 374 crowns.</p>
<p>The group on Wednesday announced major reorganisation and staff layoffs and on Friday the government said it was setting up a working group to value its assets, fuelling speculation that the state might sell off its 51 percent stake in 1998.</p>
<p>Other heavily-traded shares were Novo Nordisk, up 19 crowns to 580, and A.P. Moeller's D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg which rose 8,000 crowns to 184,000 and 4,000 crowns to 258,000 respectively.</p>
<p>Superfos, one of three bidders for roadbuilder Phoenix Contractors in Denmark's first open takeover bid, slipped five crowns to 780 while the object of its desires -- non-KFX Phoenix -- climbed 15 crowns to 635, on the heels of Thursday's 30-crown gain.</p>
