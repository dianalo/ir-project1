<p>Colombian President Ernesto Samper named two new cabinet ministers Friday as part of a reshuffle that could see up to six ministers replaced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>A statement from the Casa de Narino presidential palace said Samper had named economist Carlos Ronderos Torres to replace Morris Harf as minister of Foreign Trade.</p>
<p>He also appointed Deputy Health Minister Ivan Moreno as Colombia's new Labour minister.</p>
<p>Harf, who joined the cabinet just last year, has been questioned repeatedly by the Colombian media in recent months because his family-owned coal company failed to cancel a past-due loan made by the Colombian military.</p>
<p>Obregon, a former labour leader, indicated in an interview with local radio that he had stepped down to run for a seat in Congress.</p>
<p>But his prestige was battered earlier this year when union bosses branded him a traitor for defending government plans to hold public sector workers to a weighted 13.5 percent pay hike despite inflation of 21.6 percent last year.</p>
<p>The government eventually agreed to pay raises of as much as 20 percent after a week-long strike in February that threatened to erupt in mass street protests.</p>
<p>Government sources have said up to four other members of Samper's 15-strong cabinet are expected to be replaced, perhaps as early as next week.</p>
<p>Officials likely to be ousted in the continuing reshuffle include Agriculture Minister Cecilia Lopez, Communications Minister Saulo Arboleda, Development Minister Orlando Cabrales and Environment Minister Jose Vicente Mogollon, the sources said.</p>
<p>According to local media reports, Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, Samper's right-hand man and a vocal critic of the United States, plans to step down in May to launch a bid for the presidency in elections next year.</p>
