<p>Dean Smith reached his 11th NCAA basketball tournament Final Four as coach of North Carolina on Sunday as the Tar Heels whipped sixth-seeded Louisville 97-74 in the East Region final.</p>
<p>Shammond Williams scored 22 points and Vince Carter had five points in a key second-half run as North Carolina squandered most of a 21-point halftime lead before running away for a 23-point victory.</p>
<p>North Carolina became the third top-seeded team to safely reach the Final Four in Indianapolis. Defending champions and West Region winner Kentucky and Midwest Region champion Minnesota nailed down final four spots Saturday.</p>
<p>Fourth-seeded Arizona was leading 10th-seeded Providence 32-31 at halftime in the Southest region final at Birmingham, Alabama. Arizona stunned top-ranked, top-seeded Kansas in the Southeast regional semifinals.</p>
<p>Carter finished with 15 points for the Tar Heels (28-6), who had all five starters score in double figures and extended their winning streak to 16 games.</p>
<p>Smith, who passed legendary Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp to move atop the all-time college basketball wins list in the second round, will be looking for his third National title in his fourth trip to the Final Four this decade.</p>
<p>Alex Sanders scored 20 points and Alvin Sims added 14 for Louisville, which was in the regional finals for the first time since 1986, the last time the Cardinals won the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>Williams scored 15 of his points in the first half as North Carolina stormed out to a 54-33 halftime lead.</p>
<p>The Cardinals, with starting point guard DeJuan Wheat playing on a badly sprained left ankle, made a run at the Tar Heels in the second half using bursts of 7-1 and 8-0 to pull within seven points at 59-52 with 13:29 left.</p>
<p>B.J. Flynn hit two three-pointers to cap a 9-3 run for Louisville and with 8:14 to go the Cardinals were down by just one three-pointer at 69-66.</p>
<p>But the Cardinals went cold, missing on nine consecutive shots as North Carolina pulled away for the victory.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing about this team is there's no quit in them,&quot; said longtime Louisville coach Denny Crum.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that second half run showed the kind of character that they have, and they've done that all year. I know we kind of ran out of gas, but we made a great run at them.&quot;</p>
