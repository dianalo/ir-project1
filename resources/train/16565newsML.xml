<p>Australia's net foreign debt for the June quarter will be released at 11.30 a.m. (0130 GMT).</p>
<p>Following the release of June quarter balance of payments data on Tuesday, economists generally expect the debt figure to come in near the top of the previous market range, although there are some dissenting voices.</p>
<p>Economists that Reuters contacted after the release of the balance of payments data tended to favour a debt figure between A$186 and A$188 billion, at the top of the range of forecasts taken last week, although there may be some downward revisions to historical data, they said.  </p>
<p>The median forecast of a Reuters survey conducted last Friday was for net foreign debt of A$185.9 billion, with forecasts ranging from A$178 to A$188 billion.</p>
<p>Final calculations of the debt figure have been helped by the release on Tuesday of the June quarter balance of payments.</p>
<p>That data showed that of the A$5.06 billion quarterly current account deficit, A$3.63 billion was funded through debt financing.</p>
<p>This A$3.6 billion is added to the March quarter A$184.8 billion net foreign debt and then allowance is made for exchange rate effects.  </p>
<p>However, the March figure may be revised, which would then change the basis for calculating the June figure, economists said.</p>
<p>Economists from Citibank, Macquarie Bank, Bankers Trust and Commonwealth Bank expected a figure between A$185.6 and A$188 billion. When surveyed last week, forecasts for this group ranged from A$182 to A$188 billion. Bain and Company had revised down their forecast to A$179 billion from A$186 billion,</p>
<p>Citibank lifted their forecast after the data, while Macquarie and Commonwealth were already near the top end of forecasts and left them unchanged.  </p>
<p>Bankers Trust senior economist David Bassanese shaved A$0.3 billion of his original forecast following the balance of payments data due to some downward revisions in the historical data, but overall he saw offsetting effects essentially cancelling each other out.</p>
<p>&quot;While the quarter might be somewhat higher, there will be downward revisions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bain and Co economist Tony Meer said the fall in their forecast was due to historical revisions in the calculation of public sector debt which would lower the base for the June quarter result.  </p>
<p>&quot;It (debt) will still rise in the quarter, but it will be off a lower base,&quot; he said, adding that such a result will be neutral for markets.</p>
<p>&quot;If the base isn't revised, then it's a hefty increase, and to me that's a bit of a negative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Following on from last Wednesday's upgrading in Australia's ratings outlook to positive from stable by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp, interest in the debt figure will probably be greater than usual, some said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the fact that S&amp;P have said positive things about Australia, and mentioned measures of foreign liabilities ... people will probably be looking at it more closely,&quot; Macquarie bank economist Andrew Ticehurst said.</p>
