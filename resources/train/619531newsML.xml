<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil eased off Tuesday's closing lows on Wednesday as benchmark futures pared losses but traders said prices looked set to remain sickly in ample supply.</p>
<p>June gas oil futures closed $1.00 higher at $173.00 a tonne, having shed $5.75 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges traded at June IPE +$1.25 and +$1.50 fob ARA for storage material and +$1.75 fob Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was fairly quiet ahead of the Corpus Christi public holiday in parts of Germany.</p>
<p>A Russian cargo traded at June IPE +$1.50 cif NWE for flexible delivery. Traders said the seller had a 21,000 and a 27,000 tonne cargo on the water and the buyer had the option to take either one.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of stuff around at the moment and the collapse in prices in the Med isn't really helping the situation,&quot; one player said.</p>
<p>At least three Med cargoes of diesel spec material were believed to on their way to Northwest Europe. Traders said the cargoes would likely go into the owners' systems.</p>
