<p>The mayor of the Indonesian town of Solo in Central Java has threatened to take political rivals to court if they do not repaint sidewalks and trees in a city square in the ruling party's colour, a media report on Sunday said.</p>
<p>As part of their birthday celebrations, members of the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) recently painted the public objects white after the local government had earlier painted them yellow -- the colour of the ruling Golkar party.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the authority of the local government and if they want to change it they must ask permission,&quot; Mayor Imam Sutopo was quoted as saying in the Moslem Republika daily.</p>
<p>The colourful protest was part of ongoing concern within the two sanctioned minority parties -- the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and the PPP -- about the &quot;yellowisation&quot; programme of some local government officials.</p>
<p>Indonesia goes to the polls on May 29, but the painting of public objects yellow by government officials, who are all members of Golkar, is seen jumping the gun before the official tightly-controlled 25-day campaign period.</p>
<p>While the PPP's colour is green, the so-called &quot;white group&quot; in Indonesian politics is the colour of an amphorous group of activists who have consistently called on people to spoil their ballots or not vote in a protest against tight political control.</p>
