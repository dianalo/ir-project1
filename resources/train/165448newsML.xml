<p>Superior Services Inc president G.W. Dietrich said a 72 percent decline in prices received for recyclable waste paper during the past year resulted in a reduction of more than $1.6 million in revenues and about $0.06 per share in earnings for the third quarter.</p>
<p>The reduction for the year to date was about $5.5 million in revenues or $0.19 in earnings per share, Dietrich added in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's recycling operations remain profitable due to our floor pricing arrangement with a large mill, the fees charged for collection services and the cost efficiency of our paper recycling operation,&quot; said Dietrich.</p>
<p>He noted that acquisition activity will have a more significant impact on revenue growth beginning in the fourth quarter. The solid waste services company has acquired 11 businesses with nearly $19 million in annualized revenue since its initial public offering in March 1996.</p>
<p>Earlier, Superior reported third-quarter earnings of $4.0 million or $0.24 per share compared with year-ago earnings of $2.6 million or $0.19 per share. Revenues were $29.7 million, up from $25.1 million.</p>
