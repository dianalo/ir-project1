<p>Germany and Russia on Wednesday signed a pact to reschedule 25 billion marks in old Soviet debt for 20 to 25 years, the last such agreement, German finance minister Theo Waigel said.</p>
<p>&quot;Parallel with other agreements with other members of the Paris Club (of creditors), the question of Soviet debt should finally be closed,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Russia is paying its debts punctually and is returning to international capital markets,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
<p>Germany is Russia's largest foreign creditor, accounting for over half of its foreign debt.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Russia announced it would launch a one billion mark Eurobond in early March as part of about $3 billion to be issued in Eurobonds this year.</p>
<p>The Bonn rescheduling, which was also signed by Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits, is the fourth since Russia agreed to take over the old Soviet debt in 1993.</p>
<p>It marks the bilateral implementation of a Paris Club agreement reached in April last year.</p>
<p>Waigel said the pact shows Germany's support for economic reforms in Russia, and recognition of its progress in curbing inflation, consolidating its budget and stabilising its currency.</p>
<p>&quot;This pact is aimed at creating the conditions for sustainable economic development in Russia, and to allow it full access to international capital markets,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
