<p>German police reported a peaceful build-up to Borussia Dortmund's European Cup semifinal first leg with Manchester United on Wednesday as around 1,500 fans enjoyed a pre-match party in the city centre.</p>
<p>Police, mounting their biggest-ever security operation for a Dortmund match, kept their presence discreet while fans of the two teams drank beer, sang and danced together in sunshine at the party laid on by Borussia Dortmund and city authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;This is wonderful,&quot; Borussia spokesman Josef Schneck said. &quot;The mood is as good as the weather.&quot;</p>
<p>Dortmund police said the only trouble had been a brawl between rival groups of German fans at the station. Police detained 20 people and accompanied 30 others to the stadium, warning them they would be detained if there was more trouble.</p>
<p>Manchester fans were involved in trouble at the club's last away tie in Portugal. Eight English fans were injured after a clash with riot police following a quarter-final at Porto.</p>
<p>But police said there had been few problems with the visiting fans in Germany. &quot;One Manchester supporter had to spend the night with us because he had a bit too much to drink but it was nothing serious,&quot; a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Police believe some troublemakers have travelled from other parts of Germany for the match. The spokesman said the hooligans were well-known and were being closely monitored.</p>
<p>Around 4,000 English fans were expected in Dortmund for the sell-out match, about 500 of them without tickets.</p>
<p>The mood appeared relaxed, with police donning the scarves of the two clubs, distributing souvenir stickers to fans and even taking photographs for them.</p>
<p>The fans were entertained by music and guest appearances by former Dortmund and Manchester United players.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope when these people come back to Manchester you look after them,&quot; former United stalwart Pat Crerand told the Manchester fans from the temporary stage erected for the party.</p>
<p>Beer stalls scattered around the city centre square where the party was being held did a heavy trade, serving up some of Dortmund's best-known brews to thirsty fans.</p>
<p>&quot;We're really pleased that the Dortmund and Manchester fans are here together,&quot; Schneck said. &quot;I heard a lot of sceptics questioning whether this was a good idea but we've done this 15 times in the past and you can see it's going well.&quot;</p>
<p>Schneck said he did not anticipate any major problems later in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;We're prepared. But if things go as they've gone up until now, there should be no problems,&quot; he said.</p>
