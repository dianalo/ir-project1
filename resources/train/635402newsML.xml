<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended at a new 1997 high on Tuesday and dealers said the market looked set for further gains.</p>
<p>The lead Nikkei 225 June contract added 185 points to close at 20,550 after hitting a peak of 20,700. Its previous strongest close was on May 19 when it ended at 20,535.</p>
<p>Volume was higher than in recent days at 17,605 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a change in sentiment as people feel the economy is improving. Yesterday's auto sales figure was quite good too,&quot; a trader at a European futures house said.  </p>
<p>He said the June Nikkei could retrace down to the 20,300 level before heading higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We should trade between 20,300 and 20,800 over the next few sessions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A chartist with a local institution said a weekly close above the 20,500 level would point to a bull run on the charts.</p>
<p>The June MSCI Taiwan index ended at 349.4 against its opening 348.1 on volume of 297 lots.</p>
