<p>Fifteen Japanese Red Army guerrillas are operating in Colombia and may be training Colombian Marxist rebels, intelligence service sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The group is comprised of four women, including Fusako Shigenobu, 51, and 11 men, a source at the state security service DAS said.</p>
<p>An alert issued by Interpol indicates that most have experience in conflicts in Southeast Asia and the Mideast and have carried out a range of bombings, hijackings and kidnappings, the DAS source said.</p>
<p>The Red Army task force is believed to be based in the violence-torn region of Uraba and could be training Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas in &quot;terror tactics,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have only just received word that this group is in Colombia but we believe they have been here for a considerable time,&quot; the official said. &quot;Intelligence reports indicate they are in Uraba training the guerrillas and may have been behind a recent car bomb attack there.&quot;</p>
<p>The army, police and military intelligence have joined the hunt for the international rebels and posters of the 15 alleged Japanese guerrillas are being distributed. The Japanese embassy was unavailable for comment on the reports.</p>
<p>The Japanese Red Army, founded in 1971, has links with Libya and is allied to hardline, anti-Israeli Palestinian factions.</p>
