<p>A sharp gain in index heavyweight Telecom plus a solid improvement in the forestry sector hoisted the New Zealand share market to a respectable gain by the close of a busy Wednesday session.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index ended 17.42 points higher at 2,384.97 on strong turnover worth nearly NZ$83 million.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market started the session on a modestly firmer note in a muted response to Wall Street's record close.</p>
<p>First NZ Capital broker Vicki St John said Telecom's 12 cent gain to NZ$7.29 was the main driver, but several of the other majors had also posted solid gains.  </p>
<p>Telecom's gain was due to stronger offshore buying, attractive yields and continued share price support from the buyback, dealers said.</p>
<p>DB Group gained three cents to NZ$2.25 after reporting slightly higher than expected first half net profit of NZ$17.16 million, up from $16 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Operationally it was a good result, particularly in a market that has been declining, in terms of the overall beer market,&quot; St John said.</p>
<p>&quot;So to have a result that was flat at the EBIT line in this environment is a pretty good result,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>Steel and Tube spent another day on the recovery trail, gaining 25 to NZ$7.30, having started the week at $6.80.</p>
<p>Restaurant Brands, floated earlier this month, continued its strong run, ending at NZ$2.55, up three, but one cent off its historical high. It floated at NZ$2.20, so has offered investors a gross gain of nearly 16 percent in a week.</p>
