<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has resigned but will remain in his post through President Bill Clinton's inauguration for his second term in January, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;He has resigned,&quot; one official told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Officials said Christopher, who has a heavy schedule of commitments over the next two months, would continue in his post until Clinton was sworn in on January 20.</p>
<p>U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell are considered leading candidates to succeed him.</p>
<p>Clinton, asked about Christopher's future by reporters as he flew to Washington from Little Rock, Arkansas where the president spent election night, said: &quot;We will have a formal announcement&quot; in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Christopher discussed his plans with Clinton on Tuesday in Little Rock. Defense Secretary William Perry is also planning to resign, and Clinton is reported to be considering other cabinet changes as he starts his new term.</p>
