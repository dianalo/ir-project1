<p>The appointment of new Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, described as a &quot;quiet tiller&quot; lacking political ambition, will do little to speed plodding market reforms in Ukraine, political analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said reforms firmly rest in the hands of President Leonid Kuchma.</p>
<p>But by placing his close friend at the helm of the government, Kuchma had demonstrated his desire to retain his post in elections still two years away in the former Soviet republic of 51 million people, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of reforms, the name Pustovoitenko means almost no change,&quot; Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, head of the Centre for Independent Political Research, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Pustovoitenko always was, is, and will be Kuchma's man,&quot; he said. &quot;This means the president now rules the government directly and has all the lynchpins needed to carry out reforms and speed them up.&quot;</p>
<p>Reformist deputy Yuri Budzugan also doubted there would be any change in the pace of reform in Ukraine, whose economy contracted 7.5 percent in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p>Steadily worsening economic conditions could be the biggest threat to Kuchma's re-election bid. The first litmus test will be a parliamentary election slated for early next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Pustovoitenko's appointment will change nothing in terms of reforms,&quot; Budzugan said.</p>
<p>Pustovoitenko, who earned parlimantary backing on Wednesday by a slim margin, begins his job as the seventh prime minister in six years of Ukraine's post-Soviet history.</p>
<p>Kuchma last week created a High Economic Council (HEC) to make strategic economic decisions and generate ideas on boosting reforms, which he began in 1994 but which have not taken root.</p>
<p>The council -- made up of 30 people including 16 deputies, the parliamentary speaker, several former prime ministers, and leading economists and academics -- is due to reflect on implementing anti-crisis measures drawn up by Kuchma last week.</p>
<p>They include economic liberalisation, halving taxes within a year, speeding up privatisation, legalising the vast shadow economy, an amnesty for all Ukrainian capital hidden in foreign bank accounts, improvement of the investment climate, fast agricultural reforms and demonopolisation.</p>
<p>Analysts said Pustovoitenko's appoinment could mean fewer political struggles. Relations between the president, recently resigned prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko, and parliament were not especially happy.</p>
<p>&quot;The appointment of Pustovoitenko removes all problems in relations between the president and cabinet of ministers,&quot; Vasyl Kremin, Kuchma's top political adviser, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a decent man and there are no doubts he will behave in an honest way in his dealings with the president,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kuchma alluded to the situation when he said on Wednesday: &quot;Pavlo Lazarenko as prime minister played his own game.&quot;</p>
<p>Some observers said Kuchma was taking his own political interests into account with Pustovoitenko's appointment, as a way to maintain support during the parliamentary election due next March and to win the presidential vote scheduled for 1999.</p>
<p>Kuchma recently proposed extending parliament's term to avoid populism and force deputies to pass several reform laws.</p>
<p>Kuchma and the pro-presidential People's Democratic Party, of which Pustovoitenko is a member, are expected to face a tough challenge from the leftist opposition which favours a return to a Soviet-style economy -- who political analysts say have an early lead because of the bad state of the economy.</p>
<p>Last year GDP fell 10 per cent, the shadow economy is estimated at between 40 and 60 per cent of all economic activity, and a backlog of unpaid wages, pensions and student grants has swelled to 6.7 billion hryvnias ($3.6 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt the electoral factor is playing a part,&quot; Olexiy Haran, a political analyst at the Den daily, said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no time to waste before elections and it's better for Kuchma to appoint a man who is on his side,&quot; he said. &quot;Under these conditions not choosing someone familiar, and a friend, would be a risky business for Kuchma.&quot;</p>
