<p>Rebels pushed on with their drive into Zaire's southern economic heartland on Sunday, ignoring the start of peace talks in South Africa.</p>
<p>Fresh from the capture of the diamond capital Mbuji-Mayi, they drove south to tighten the noose around Zaire's second largest city, Lubumbashi, in the potentially lucrative copperbelt.</p>
<p>Expatriates said rebel leader Laurent Kabila's forces had taken the small town of Tenke, site of what is planned to be the world's biggest copper and cobalt mine, some 200 km (125 miles) northwest of Lubumbashi on a main railway.</p>
<p>They said Fungurume, 15 km (nine miles) from Tenke at the other end of the mining concession and from where they spoke, was seeing a transition typical of Zaire's six-month civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;Last night the FAZ (Zairean army) soldiers got drunk and swaggered around but they didn't actually loot. Today, the people are preparing a celebration and decorating the village for the rebels,&quot; said one, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope they come today because otherwise the soldiers will definitely loot.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's Consolidated Eurocan Ventures Ltd agreed in December to buy 55 percent of the Tenke-Fungurume concession from state-owned copper giant Gecamines. It is set to be the biggest foreign investment in Zaire for two decades.</p>
<p>Traders in nearby Kolwezi, where Belgian expatriates were massacred in a 1978 secessionist rebellion, said Zairean soldiers based in the town were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Rebels are also at most 220 km (135 miles) from Lubumbashi to the northeast, in the town of Kasenga on Zambia's border.</p>
<p>The copper capital is eagerly awaiting their arrival.</p>
<p>People say they are praying that the rebels' first direct peace talks with representatives of ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko, which began in South Africa on Saturday, will not slow Kabila down.</p>
<p>Lubumbashi is steeling itself for looting by Zairean soldiers as they flee.</p>
<p>Mbuji-Mayi, 1,000 km (600 miles) away towards the capital Kinshasa, was looted by soldiers who stole vehicles and drove off on Friday with their booty towards nearby Kananga.</p>
<p>Rebels who took the town at the weekend were restoring order and consolidating control on Sunday, urging people to work as normal on Monday, mining sources in the town said.</p>
<p>What concerns people in Lubumbashi is that, with the city in a southeastern cul-de-sac, troops have nowhere safe to run to. If they are trapped they may fight, some think.</p>
<p>Kyungu wa Kumwanza, governor of Shaba province which he calls by its old name Katanga, told a mass rally in the city on Saturday that his priority was to avert bloodshed.</p>
<p>Many locals saw it as a sign that he wanted the rebels to meet little resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;Katanga refuses to destroy itself, or to destroy its people and belongings,&quot; Kyungu said. &quot;We must not have bloodshed, we want liberty for all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone seen carrying a television away on his head will go to meet the Lord with that television,&quot; he bellowed, warning against looting that has ravaged the city in past unrest.</p>
<p>Without once mentioning the rebels by name, he said that if people were expecting someone to arrive, they should await him calmly in their homes rather than fleeing.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the army, reinforced recently by outside troops from Kinshasa, will do.</p>
<p>Expatriates in Lubumbashi, many of whom own businesses and have much to fear from looting, have mostly sent their families away but some 300 remain, most of them Belgians. Belgium has sent five soldiers to the city to help protect them.</p>
