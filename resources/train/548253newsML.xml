<p>An FBI agent who searched Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh's car after McVeigh's arrest testified on Monday that he found passages from a right-wing novel alleged to be a blueprint for the attack.</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent William Eppright said he found sheets of paper containing short passages from the &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; inside a sealed envelope in McVeigh's car.</p>
<p>Government prosecutors say the tale of an attack on FBI headquarters was McVeigh's inspiration for the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>&quot;The real value of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties,&quot; Eppright read from the sheets in the courtroom.</p>
<p>&quot;More important, though, is what we taught the politicians and bureaucrats today. They learned this afternoon not one of them is beyond our reach. They can huddle behind barbed wire and tanks in the city, or they can hide behind the concrete walls and alarm systems of their country estates. But we can still find them and kill them,&quot; Eppright read.</p>
<p>Earlier, the state trooper who arrested McVeigh said he found a handwritten note about the need to buy more explosives in a patrol car where McVeigh had sat.</p>
<p>&quot;TNT, $5 a stick. Need more. Call after 1 May, see if I can get some more,&quot; read the notation on the back of a business card, Oklahoma State Trooper Charles Hanger testified.</p>
<p>Hanger arrested McVeigh north of Oklahoma City hours after the bombing when he noticed his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis had no license plate.</p>
<p>Eppright said that when he searched McVeigh's car he also found sheets containing quotations from Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Adams and philosopher John Locke. &quot;When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear government, there is tyranny,&quot; a quote from Samuel Adams said.</p>
<p>McVeigh, who has pleaded not guilty to the bombing and faces the death penalty if convicted, watched the proceedings intently but showed no emotion.</p>
<p>Hanger testified that when he arrested McVeigh the Gulf War veteran was armed with a semi-automatic pistol. &quot;I noticed he had a bulge under his left arm,&quot; he said. He asked McVeigh to open his jacket slowly and McVeigh told him, &quot;I have a weapon.&quot;</p>
<p>Hanger, who testified he had no idea that McVeigh might be linked to the bombing when he arrested him, asked McVeigh why he carried the pistol. &quot;He felt he had the right to carry it for his protection,&quot; he said McVeigh told him.</p>
<p>Under cross-examination by defence counsel, Hanger said McVeigh was cooperative during the arrest.</p>
<p>The prosecution also tried to establish the integrity of the evidence collected from McVeigh by showing it was not contaminated. Hanger testified that his patrol car was new when he received it and that it had not been used to transport explosives or transport individuals who had been charged with possession of explosives.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they would bring into court on Tuesday a large scale model of downtown Oklahoma City and the rear axle of the Ryder truck used in the bombing, that was allegedly rented by McVeigh.</p>
