<p>Japanese stocks recovered strongly on Monday in a rollercoaster session, clawing back some of the huge losses sustained last week and lifting other Asian markets.</p>
<p>After initially hitting an early low of 17,019.56, Japan's key Nikkei 225 index ended a hectic session up 815.14 points, or 4.71 percent, at 18,118.79 -- its first rally in a week.</p>
<p>Monday's sharp gain was more than enough to offset what the benchmark lost on Friday, when it suffered the biggest single-day drop in two years. It lost more than 2,000 points last week because of spreading gloom over the government's ability to keep the nation's economic recovery on track.</p>
<p>Analysts called the rebound &quot;technical&quot;, however, and said the market was still gripped by worries about the economy and the health of some financial institutions.</p>
<p>The rally was also bolstered by a report that a senior official of Japan's ruling party had called for measures to deal with weak stock prices. But a top government official quickly denied that any bailout measures would be taken by the government.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks rose on solid gains in the banking sector, and pared losses in property counters, brokers said. The Hang Seng Index closed 97.71 points higher at 13,289.21.</p>
<p>Edwin Cheung, dealing director at Taiwan Securities, said buying was mainly focused on banking stocks as investors took action ahead of earnings announcements expected soon.</p>
<p>The surge in Tokyo also provided an afternoon lift. &quot;Nobody needs a crisis in the region so the rebound in Japan is certainly helpful,&quot; said Kent Rossiter, institutional sales manager at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Stocks in Seoul ended Monday's trading at exactly Saturday's closing of 659.54 points as fears over strikes matched improving sentiment in financial stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>South Korea faces its biggest strikes ever on Wednesday when the nation's two main union umbrella groups plan to call out an all-out strike in protest at a new labour law.</p>
<p>Brokers said many investors were optimistic that a last-minute solution, or at least some indication of an early settlement, to the stoppages could be reached.</p>
<p>Taiwan's main stock index closed higher for the third straight day, rising to a six-year high to end up 71.40 points, or one percent, at 7,189.47.</p>
<p>Brokers cited healthy rotational rises in construction shares, textiles, electrics, electronics and plastics.</p>
<p>The index has rebounded for six of the past seven sessions since taking a 1.64 percent plunge on January 4 after Taiwan provincial governor James Soong's shock resignation to protest moves to dismantle his largely redundant administration.</p>
<p>The political uncertainties have waned since President Lee Teng-hui met Soong last week, brokers said.</p>
<p>Thai stocks closed sharply lower in moderate trade as investors sold on concerns that the government faced difficulty implementing plans to assist the Thai property sector, analysts said.</p>
<p>The SET Index ended down 17.61 points, or 2.10 percent, to 822.89.</p>
<p>At 1145 GMT, the dollar was trading at 116.31/41 yen and 1.5842/47 marks, .</p>
<p>Gold fell slightly in Hong Kong in subdued trading. Bullion ended at US$358.50/359.00 against New York's $358.80/359.30 close on Friday.</p>
<p>Crude futures firmed, boosted by worries about cold weather in the U.S. northeast. February Brent climbed 16 cents to $24.50 per barrel from London trading on Friday. March rose 18 cents to $24.02.</p>
