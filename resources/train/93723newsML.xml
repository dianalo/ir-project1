<headline>ASIAN DEBT MARKETS - Dull but deals developing.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-10-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian debt markets were extremely slow on Thursday, with no new launches to report.</p>
<p>There were some new developments, however.</p>
<p>Bank of China officials today said they are considering a dollar bond issue, but declined to give a timetable or an amount for the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always following the market to see whether we should issue a Yankee bond,&quot; one bank official said.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards to short term, we have not yet reached any decision,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bankers said State Development Bank of China is taking bids on its Yankee issue. The state-held policy bank said in June that it planned to seek about US$300 million in funding abroad.</p>
<p>There also have been reports that Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp is mulling a dollar bond.</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong market, bankers said Dah Sing Bank is taking bids for a HK$1 billion borrowing. The issue is expected to be eligible for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), or discount window.</p>
<p>Eligibility for LAF makes an issue more attractive to banks because holders of the qualifying debt can engage in repurchase agreements with the monetary authority, increasing liquidity.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there was some speculation that Dao Heng Bank might issue another LAF-eligible FRCD, but bankers noted that Guoco Group, which holds a large share of Dao Heng Bank, recenly issued a US$180 million floating rate note.</p>
<p>On the loan side, a Hong Kong property consortium is seeking bids on a HK$6.4 billion facility to finance a residential redevelopment project in Hong Kong's Pokfulam district.</p>
<p>Bids will be taken on three proposals that differ in the way the guarantee is structured.</p>
<p>In other debt news, Standard and Poor's Corp revised the rating outlook of Reliance Industries to positive from stable. Bankers said Reliance mandated a 150 million Sterling 10-year bond issue to HSBC Markets several months ago.</p>
