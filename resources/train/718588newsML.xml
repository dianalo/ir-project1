<headline>FOCUS - German crude sale plan knocks oil price.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oil prices fell further on Thursday, hit by Germany's decision to sell off 400 million marks ($230 million) worth of strategic crude reserves this year to plug a growing budget deficit.</p>
<p>The sale would release at least 75,000 barrels per day -- equal to a medium-sized North Sea oilfield -- onto a healthily supplied market already braced for the second wave of Iraqi exports under a United Nations oil-for-food plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing is immaculate but if the German government believes (oil) prices are going lower then it makes sense for them,&quot; said Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at Swiss bank UBS.</p>
<p>The news knocked North Sea Brent crude under $18 a barrel on the London futures market. The international benchmark deepened Wednesday's losses to close 26 cents down at $17.96.</p>
<p>The oil, kept in salt caverns near the northern port of Wilhemshaven, was stored shortly after the oil price shock of 1974.</p>
<p>Bonn government sources also said that further sales would follow next year</p>
<p>Economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said last month that Bonn was considering selling 7.3 million tonnes of oil.</p>
<p>The government said at the time that this was one of the measures under consideration to cut the budget deficits as Germany struggles to qualify for European monetary union.</p>
<p>Today's decision was deplored by the International Energy Agency (IEA), set up by the West after the '70s oil price shock to monitor stocks in the key global economies.</p>
<p>Up to 750,000 barrels per day of Iraqi crude could also soon be adding to world supply if the U.N. approves Baghdad's plan for distributing aid, submitted in draft form on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The key news that the market is waiting for is whether or not the Iraqi plan is acceptable to the U.N.,&quot; said brokers GNI in a report earlier today.</p>
<p>Iraqi officials will meet with Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. representative in Baghdad, on Saturday for further talks.</p>
<p>De Mistura, told Reuters on Wednesday the distribution plan required further work before it could be submitted to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan for approval, but he gave no indication how long this would take.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the U.N. plan implemented last December, Baghdad is allowed to sell $2 billion of oil over 180 days to raise money for humanitarian imports.</p>
<p>The deal was renewed on June 8 but Iraq has suspended exports pending the completion of improved arrangements for getting food and medicines to central and southern parts of the country.</p>
<p>Analysts say Iraq's return could push Brent crude back towards the 13-month low of $17.32 a barrel posted in mid-June, as the extra barrels flow into heavily swollen stocks.</p>
