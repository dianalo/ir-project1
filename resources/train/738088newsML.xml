<p>Canadian bonds opened softer in light trading on Friday, amid early weakness in U.S. fixed-income markets and further profit-taking after strong gains recorded this week, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people are looking an excuse to sell and they got one in the States. We're just going down with them pretty well lockstep,&quot; said Hank Cunningham, director of fixed income with First Marathon Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.50 to C$119.25 to yield 6.526 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond fell 9/32 to yield 6.51 percent. The yields on the bonds moved from trading at par to a positive spread of two basis points.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and U.S. bonds opened the session weaker, with profit-taking hurting prices in both countries. A wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit also hurt prices in that country, Cunningham said.</p>
<p>The profit-taking follows a session in which the yield on the Canadian 30-year benchmark bond reached record-low yield of 6.472 percent. Analysts said the pullback in bond prices comes as little surpise.  </p>
<p>&quot;It all smells of a market top to me, near term anyway. I don't think anybody is abandoning their long-term bull story, but I think it's vulnerable to a little bit of a pullback here,&quot; said Cunningham.</p>
<p>The short end of the Canadian yield curve continued to get hit by speculation of a near-term Bank of Canada rate hike. While some money market traders said a weak dollar and signs of an accelerating economy pointed to the need for a rate hike, others said there was little impetus for the central bank to tighten.  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.33 to C$109.32 to yield 5.971 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond fell 9/32 to yield 6.23 percent. The negative spread moved to 26 basis points from 24 basis points at Thursday's close.</p>
