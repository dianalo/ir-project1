<title>RUSSIA: Chechen poll frontrunner pledges sovereignty.</title>
<headline>Chechen poll frontrunner pledges sovereignty.</headline>

<p>Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen guerrilla leader who is favourite to win Monday's presidential election, forecast victory on Sunday and pledged to turn the breakaway region into a fully sovereign state.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole world, including Russia, will have to recognise that the elections are democratic and to recognise the legitimate authority of this popularly-elected president,&quot; he told an eve-of-polling news conference at his campaign headquarters just outside the capital, Grozny.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to be recognised as a sovereign state,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Moscow, a deputy foreign minister, Viktor Posuvalyuk, underlined sensitivity on the issue of sovereignty. Russia, he said, was ready to take firm measures, including the severence of relations, against any country that moved to grant diplomatic recognition to Chechnya.</p>
<p>&quot;We have warned the whole international community,&quot; he told Interfax news agency. However, he acknowledged there had been no signs yet of any country taking such a step.</p>
<p>Maskhadov said Russia seemed unwilling to sit down at the negotiating table to continue the peace process he opened after his irregular army's stunning victories over a greatly superior Russian force last summer.</p>
<p>Moscow withdrew its troops last month after two years of fruitless war, giving Chechnya back the de facto independence it declared when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. But Moscow insisted in last autumn's peace deal on leaving aside the question of Chechen sovereignty for five years.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, who straw polls suggest will win the presidency easily, made it clear, however, that he wanted to get back to negotiating sovereignty &quot;as quickly as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to talk to Russia on the basis of international law,&quot; he said, referring to the phrasing of the peace deal he signed last August with then Kremlin security chief Alexander Lebed -- a deal some Russian politicians feel went too far towards appeasing the Chechens.</p>
<p>Maskhadov went further, saying he wanted &quot;war reparations&quot; from Moscow. Russia has offered aid to rebuild the ruined economy and housing stock after the election. &quot;We won't ask for aid from Russia, we will demand war reparations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old former Soviet artillery colonel repeated accusations that Russian special forces might try to wreck the election by staging &quot;provocations&quot;. Chechen leaders accused Moscow of being behind the murder of six foreign Red Cross workers last month -- a charge Russia hotly denied.</p>
<p>For fear of such acts, Maskhadov said he very much wanted to win in the first round of voting on Monday.</p>
<p>Straw polls suggest he could win the 50 percent of the vote needed to do that. If not he would run off against the second-placed candidate in two weeks.</p>
<p>Maskhadov said he reckoned any one of three of the 15 other candidates could come second -- but with only eight to 10 percent of the vote. They were hardline guerrilla field commander Shamil Basayev, separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and the rebels' chief spokesman Movladi Udugov.</p>
<p>He was confident of beating any of them in a second round, because, he said, he had established himself in the minds of the Chechen people as the man who brought them peace.</p>
<p>&quot;There could some manipulations or misunderstandings in the election,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we have an honest election, then I have the best chance.&quot;</p>
<p>Maskhadov dismissed fiery rhetoric from Basayev, who won fame by leading a bloody commando raid against the Russian town of Budennovsk in June 1995, as a simple electoral tactic.</p>
<p>Basayev, he said, would have a place in his government after the election. Even if he continued his opposition, Maskhadov said he was sure Basayev would find little support for a rebellion among Chechnya's heavily armed population.</p>
<p>He said he had summoned some 80 to 90 percent of the leading guerrilla commanders on Saturday and secured their agreement to abide by the election result and establish order in the war-ravaged region.</p>
<p>&quot;Some expect us to have some sort of Afghan or Tajik scenario,&quot; Maskhadov said. &quot;It won't happen.&quot;</p>
<p>His first decree as president, he said, would be to establish order among the various armed groups in Chechnya and determine who was entitled to bear arms and who was not. Illegal weapons would be confiscated and the government might even offer to buy back arms at market prices, he added.</p>
