<headline>Euro oil swaps nudge higher, supported by crude.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps ticked higher on Friday, emboldened by stronger crude futures reflecting some fund short-covering.</p>
<p>Brent crude CFDs gained 5-10 cents while gasoline tracked $2 higher and heavy fuel was $1 firmer.</p>
<p>Dealers said June 16-20 CFDs were valued around -53 cents under August Brent compared with -65 cents on Thursday with June 23-27 placed around -47/48 against -55 cents.</p>
<p>Further out the contract gained 10 cents or so with June 30-July 4 hovering around -39 cents under August from -48/49 while July 7-11 was put at -33 from -42.</p>
<p>Gasoline swaps were $2 a tonne stronger with July  traded in the morning at $185.50. Several dealers commented on heavy buying by one company on the physical market which they said looked like a squeeze possibly linked to a long swaps position.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel ticked up $1 or so with June little talked and July put at $84.75 and August at $85.50. Physical barges were traded at $86 and $87.</p>
<p>Gas oil crack spreads were put steady on 4Q97 at $4.55 with 1Q98 unchanged around $4.58 and 2Q98 at $4.05.</p>
