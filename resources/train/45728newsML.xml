<headline>LCE white sugar ends down as October expiry nears.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>White sugar futures fell in heavy Wednesday trading, as players continued to sell spot October ahead of the contract's expiry on Friday.</p>
<p>Open interest has been rapidly increasing in both the December and March contracts as traders roll forward October positions through switch dealings.</p>
<p>Turnover on Wednesday was concentrated on the October and December contracts, which between them accounted for the bulk of the day's 5,321 lots traded.</p>
<p>Traders said the expiry might produce some more offtake and market interest once October deliveries were out of the way.</p>
<p>At 1730 GMT October and December were both hovering around intraday lows.</p>
<p>October was $3.50 lower at $345.20 a tonne while December lost $3.50 to $342.50.</p>
<p>Paris positions were also lower, with October off 50 cents at $348.50 and December down $3.00 at $343.00. Matif volume totalled 1,317 lots.</p>
