<p>Indonesia's Lippo group, one of the country's largest conglomerates, announced a six-point plan on Thursday to sweeten a controversial restructuring proposal for its financial services.</p>
<p>&quot;This six-point plan is proof that we care about and listen to what the investment community says about our plan,&quot; the groups's deputy chairman, James Riady, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the group would continue with the restructuring plan as he believed many investors welcomed the move and shareholders would benefit in the long term.</p>
<p>The Riady family holds a controlling interest in the Lippo group through various companies and cross-holdings. Lippo's interests range from financial institutions to property, retail stores, manufacturing and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Riady denied market speculation that his family was trying to cash in their money and move out of Indonesia due to political uncertainty in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We have firm confidence in Indonesia's economic growth and political condition. We have freedom to choose where to invest in Asia and we still consider Indonesia the best,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He also denied market talk that his family would use the money raised through the restructuring to support its property projects, adding that the majority of the proceeds would be allocated to strengthen the group's financial services.</p>
<p>&quot;The financial services have been and always will be the most important business in the group. This plan will allow us to maintain the same level of investment and commitment. It also enables our financial servises to continue expand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lippo announced a massive internal acquisition plan early this month to restructure its financial services. Under the plan, Lippo Securities will buy another 27 percent of Lippo Life to increase its stake to 32 percent.</p>
<p>Lippo Life will then buy another 40 percent share of Lippo Bank to boost its stake to 45 percent.</p>
<p>The plan includes proposal for internal acquisitions, to be partly financed by loans, and cross-holdings.</p>
<p>Riady said on Thursday that the group would sweeten the restructuring terms for its financial services sector. It would permanently waive the 10 percent management fee on Lippo bank's pre-tax earnings, effective from September 30.</p>
<p>&quot;This waiver is worth at least 680 billion rupiah, assuming a conservative 15 percent earnings growth rate and a 17 percent discount rate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said another voluntary waiver would reduce the acquisition price of Lippo Life by Lippo Securities to 237 billion rupiah from 244 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>An additional waiver would reduce the purchase price of Lippo Bank by Lippo Life to 638 billion rupiah from 658 billion rupiah initially, Riady said.</p>
<p>He said Lippo Securities also would announce its intention to proceed with a rights issue of between 500 billion rupiah and one trillion rupiah within 12 months.</p>
<p>The group's insurance arm, Lippo Life, also planned to conduct a rights issue of between 350 billion rupiah and 500 billion rupiah within 15 months, he added. Both issues would be subject to regulatory and shareholders' approval.</p>
<p>Riady said his family would make an official announcement that it would commit the proceeds of the notes under the financial restructuring to subscribe to the proposed rights issue at Lippo Securities and any rights that might become available under that plan.</p>
<p>He said the Riady family, Lippo Bank and Lippo Life would reduce the percentage of reverse cross-holdings in an orderly manner over an appropriate period of time, but gave no details.</p>
