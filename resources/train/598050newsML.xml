<title>USA: Copper prices jump to highest level in a year.</title>
<headline>Copper prices jump to highest level in a year.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices steamed to the highest level in a year Tuesday on the threat of labour problems in key producer Chile.</p>
<p>On New York's Commodity Exchange, May copper closed up 1.60 cents at $1.181 a pound.</p>
<p>Copper inventories have eroded steadily over the past several months due to the buoyant global economy, and consumption has gone up at a time of labour troubles in Chile.</p>
<p>A brief strike Tuesday at the Chilean state smelting company Enami's Ventanas plant reminded the market of supply disruptions that could hit copper.</p>
<p>The strike was called to protest against the Chilean government's reported plans to privatise Enami and state oil firm Enap, said a union leader.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market also may have been expecting that the Federal Reserve was going to leave interest rates unchanged at Tuesday's policy-setting meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a fairly explosive rally ... if there is no interest rate rise that would be very good for the metals,&quot; said Robin Bahr, an analyst for the brokerage house Brandeis.</p>
<p>After the close, the Fed said that it was holding short-term interest rates unchanged.</p>
