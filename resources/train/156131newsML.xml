<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK shares finished mostly higher on Thursday but investors remained wary ahead of key economic indicators in the U.S. Friday and were still unsettled by yesterday's unexpected UK interest rate rise. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares settled 15.2 points higher at 3,979.1, its peak for the day, after earlier slipping to its lowest level for a month.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT- The German DAX index of 30 leading shares on Thursday ended thin-volume bourse trade at its lowest level in four weeks as the possibility of further German interest rate cuts faded and Wall Street closed lower. German rate cut hopes were knocked on Wednesday, when Britain announced a rise in its base interest rate, but the move came just before the close of floor dealings and the market did not have time to react fully. The DAX index closed floor dealings down 19.48 points, or 0.73 percent, at 2,659.25. In post bourse trade the DAX was up 6.68 at 2671.40.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed higher on Thursday before the All Saints holiday with only the expiry of the October options contract in the late afternoon giving a sparkle to otherwise listless trading. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 15.75 points or 0.74 percent at 2,140.51. Volume was 7.25 billion francs.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended with minor gains on modest volumes after a quiet session marked by see-saw moves in the stock indices. Investors were likely to hedge their bets on Friday ahead of U.S. employment figures and due to the fact that some markets such as those in Germany will remain closed for All Saints' Day. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index rose 2.2 points, to 3,725.3. The broad Swiss Performance Index (SPI) added 2.52 points, to 2,393.84 points.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo's key benchmark, the Nikkei 225, closed beneath the 20,500 line on Thursday for the first time since September 12. Most investors were sidelined, with futures-linked selling weighing heavily on the average. The Nikkei average fell 214.81 points or 1.04 percent to 20,466.86.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks ended stronger on Thursday after see-sawing in a wide range, caught between optimism after Wednesday's surge in prices and caution ahead of the release of fresh U.S. economic data. The Hang Seng index rose 72.09 points to 12,477.56 after slipping into negative territory early in the session to a low of 12,377.88 and rising to an afternoon high of 12,496.57.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares closed firmer on Thursday after a late buying spree spruced up an otherwise lifeless session as investors contemplated the future direction of local interest rates. The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed 13.5 points higher at 2,350.2, well off its intra-session low of 2,329.3.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African industrial shares ended firm buoyed by a firmer currency and golds were firm despite a weak bullion price and a softer rand gold price. The overall index ended up 83.5 points to 6,975.3 points, the industrial index gained 84.5 points to 8,209.2 points and the gold index rose 24.2 points to 1,732.3.</p>
