<p>Ukraine's parliament was poised to debate the much-delayed 1997 budget at a final reading on Thursday after passing the bulk of the draft at a second reading at a late-night session on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaker Alexander Moroz, at the end of a session which ended close to 11 p.m. (2000 GMT), said the third and final reading would start in the second half of Thursday and could end the same day.</p>
<p>He pleaded with deputies to pass the budget before the first anniversary of the passing of the country's post-Soviet constitution on Saturday.</p>
<p>Parliament put to rest the bulk of hundreds of clauses in the months-late draft budget on Wednesday, leaving just a few points from the second reading to be discussed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The budget, underpinned by a series of tax reform laws, is a key step for Ukraine to qualify for a three-year, $2.5-$3.0 billion credit from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>Deputies have approved revenues of 22.39 billion hryvnias ($12.1 billion) and expenditures of 28.12 billion hryvnias.</p>
<p>They had allowed the possibility in a previous vote of covering some of the 3.33 billion hryvnia deficit with credits from the central bank.</p>
<p>But they were due on Thursday to reconsider such a step, which the central bank firmly opposes.</p>
<p>The bank wants the deficit to be covered using revenues from the Treasury-bill market and foreign credits, which are expected to cover 2.4 billion hryvnias of the deficit.</p>
<p>The draft budget, which was approved by the IMF and gained initial approval from parliament last December, forecasts annual inflation of about 25 percent -- but top government officials have forecast price growth at about 17 percent.</p>
<p>Parliament has passed two of nine tax reform laws, on value-added tax and taxation of business profits, with the balance to be passed after parliament reconvenes in September.</p>
<p>Moroz said parliament would begin initial debate of the 1998 budget in September.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian constitution states budgets must be passed by January 1, although Ukraine has not passed a budget on time since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
