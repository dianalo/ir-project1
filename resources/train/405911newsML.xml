<headline>Hagemeyer results boosted by Borsumij buy.</headline>

<p>Hagemeyer NV said on Wednesday its 1996 turnover and profits were significantly increased by the full-year consolidation of fellow trading company Borsumij Wehry, which was taken over in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, a number of smaller complementary acquisitions were successfully completed,&quot; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>Hagemeyer's 1996 net profit surged by 47.5 percent to 285.2 million guilders and turnover by 43.6 percent. The company, in which Hong Kong's First Pacific Co owns a controlling stake, expects profits and earnings per share to show a further increase in 1997.</p>
<p>Hagemeyer said its consumer and professional products group achieved a significant increase in turnover in 1996.</p>
<p>The full-year consolidation of 70 percent owned trader and retailer Ceteco, Pollyconcept and the Outdoor group contributed to this rise, just as the consolidation from October of the remaining half of Hong Kong's joint venture HCL.</p>
<p>Total organic growth of 4.6 percent fell somewhat short of expectations, Hagemeyer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our expressed concerns for the consumer electronics market were more than confirmed,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Hagemeyer said it had made structural changes in North America to reduce exposure to the consumer electronics sector.</p>
<p>The company said its electrical distribution division maintained its upward trend of the past years in 1996 and strengthened its position through takeovers.</p>
<p>&quot;In general, operational results met our standards,&quot; Hagemeyer said, adding that both gross margins and cost levels were higher than in 1995.</p>
<p>Associates' income surged to 45 million guilders from 12.6 million in 1995, reflecting acquisitions and higher contributions from investments.</p>
<p>The full-year consolidation of companies taken over and financing costs at Ceteco in particular boosted Hagemeyer's financial expenses to 106.2 million guilders from 54.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;At certain companies, steps have been taken to improve working capital utilisation,&quot; Hagemeyer said.</p>
