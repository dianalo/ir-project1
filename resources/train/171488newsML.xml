<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman held talks with King Hussein on Wednesday aimed at improving relations soured by a row over Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Weizman, making the first visit to Jordan by an Israeli president, was greeted by a Bedouin guard of honour as his helicopter landed in the grounds of the king's palace in Amman, witnesses said.</p>
<p>He was met by King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti.</p>
<p>Israel signed a landmark peace treaty with Jordan in 1994, ending a 46-year state of war and paving the way for the closest ties with any of its former Arab foes.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angered Jordan in September when he opened a tunnel entrance near Moslem sites in Jerusalem without consulting King Hussein, whose &quot;special role&quot; in supervising the sites was recognised in the 1994 agreement.</p>
<p>The tunnel opening sparked widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in which over 70 people were killed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a crisis that we have not got out of yet in the peace process in general,&quot; Information Minister Marwan Muasher told Reuters. &quot;Bilateral relations are a part of that.&quot;</p>
<p>King Hussein warned of a return to violent confrontation in the Middle East if Netanyahu reneged on agreements signed by previous governments.</p>
<p>Weizman has also travelled to Egypt to meet President Hosni Mubarak and hosted Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat as part of his efforts to smooth over tensions with Arabs since the election in May of Netanyahu, who opposes handing over Arab land in return for peace.</p>
<p>&quot;There is certainly a need to push the peace process forward, both regionally...and bilaterally,&quot; Muasher said.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials say Israel has also failed to implement parts of the 1994 agreement, particularly over cooperation on scarce water resources and opening up the Palestinian and Israeli markets to Jordanian goods.</p>
