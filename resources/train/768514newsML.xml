<p>The hard-luck Miami Dolphins said Thursday that cornerback Sam Madison, the team's second round pick in the 1997 draft, had arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle and is expected to be sidelined two to three weeks.</p>
<p>It is the latest in a long list of training camp injuries for coach Jimmy Johnson's Dolphins.</p>
<p>Wide receiver Yatil Green, the team's first round pick, suffered a season-ending torn knee ligament in a team practice two weeks ago. Special teams standouts Larry Izzo (torn Achilles tendon) and Kirby Dar Dar (knee ligaments) also suffered season-ending injuries in training camp.</p>
<p>Additionally, starting wide receiver Fred Barnett had arthroscopic right knee surgery last Sunday and is expected to be sidelined at least two weeks, defensive end Danny Stubbs is expected to miss the rest of the preseason with a fractured leg and defensive end Trace Armstrong injured his left ankle in practice on Monday.</p>
<p>Madison, a third-team All-American at Louisville, finished his college career the school's all-time leading pass interceptor with 16, including 13 over the past two seasons.</p>
