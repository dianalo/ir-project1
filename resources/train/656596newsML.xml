<headline>U.S. judge rules FBI files lawsuit may proceed.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-12</dateline>

<p>A federal judge on Thursday rejected arguments by the White House, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and the FBI seeking to dismiss a lawsuit over the White House's acquisition of secret FBI background files.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in a decision the civil lawsuit by five former Reagan or Bush White House aides can go forward and their lawyers now may gather evidence.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, brought by a conservative legal group Judicial Watch, seeks as much as $90 million in damages.</p>
<p>The White House requested and received in 1993 and 1994 hundreds of background files, including those of some prominent Republicans.</p>
<p>Lamberth rejected the White House's request to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that claimed the White House had violated privacy laws by maintaining the files for no lawfully recognised reason.</p>
<p>He denied the Federal Bureau of Investigation's request to dismiss part of the lawsuit in which it was alleged that the agency had improperly maintained the files, resulting in their disclosure to the White House with no lawful justification.</p>
<p>The judge also refused to drop Mrs. Clinton from the suit. The first lady and three former White House aides were accused in the lawsuit of invasion of privacy by requesting the files for an improper purpose.</p>
