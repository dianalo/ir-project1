<p>Bangladesh's Chittagong Cement Clinker Grinding Company Ltd is expected to offer one-for-two bonus share and issue rights shares to finance a one billion taka expansion programme, company officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company will also pay a 20 percent cash dividend for the year of 1995/96, which ended on June 30. &quot;All these will be announced at an annual general meeting on Thursday,&quot; a company official said.</p>
<p>They said the company would offer one rights share against two shares held by the investors at 1,100 taka including a premium of 1,000 taka. The company paid only 30 percent dividend on its 100-taka share in the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very ambitious extension programme. The project cost will be around one billion taka. We expect to raise more than 700 million taka through issuing the rights shares and the rest will be met from own resources,&quot; said one official.</p>
<p>The official said the money would be spent on building a second unit of the factory that would at least more than double the production volume.</p>
<p>Yussuf Abdullah Harun, President of the Federation of Chamabers of Commerce and Industry and one of the directors of the company, said the company achieved records in production, sales and profit.</p>
<p>The company produced 219,300 tonnes of cement in 1995/96 against 152,242 tonnes in the previous year. The sales also jumped to 813.9 million taka in the year from 538.5 million in 1994/95.</p>
