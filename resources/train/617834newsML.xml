<p>German building group Bilfinger + Berger Bau AG said on Tuesday it was looking abroad to boost earnings in 1997 as the crisis in the German construction sector hit domestic output.</p>
<p>&quot;Our foreign business is our main revenue earner. It currently accounts for two-thirds of earnings and we expect this to keep growing,&quot; management board chairman Christian Roth told the group's annual news conference.</p>
<p>Bilfinger reported an 11.4 percent rise in construction output in the first four months of 1997 and conditionally predicted full-year earnings would match those in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Presuming we can compensate for falling earnings at home by positive growth in our foreign business, for 1997 we expect to see construction output at around the same levels seen last year and, once again, satisfactory earnings.&quot;</p>
<p>Construction output rose to 2.83 billion marks ($1.7 billion) in the four months to end-April. Foreign output saw the strongest rise, growing 14.3 percent to 1.39 billion marks, compared with an 8.6 percent gain in domestic output to 1.39 billion.</p>
<p>While Bilfinger predicted building output in the full year would fall 1.2 percent to 9.13 billion marks, output from the group's interests abroad was forecast to rise by 5.2 percent to 4.612 billion marks.</p>
<p>1997 would see just over half of group output coming from its business abroad, while the group said domestic orders would fall 7.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just a result of the economic and structural problems in the German construction industry, but also because of our particularly selective stance in tendering for contracts,&quot; Roth said.</p>
<p>&quot;As we cannot see any signs of the market picking up in 1998, further slimming down in the domestic market looks unavoidable,&quot; he said, adding that the group's domestic payroll would decline by between 1,000 and 1,200 people in 1997.</p>
<p>Bilfinger's shares fell after the news and were quoted down two marks marks at 65 by 1230 GMT, contrasting with a near half percent gain in the DAX index of 30 leading German shares.</p>
<p>Bilfinger said that orders in the first four months were boosted by two large contracts in Thailand and Nigeria in April.</p>
<p>It also announced its Australian unit Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering had won an order worth 100 million marks to build a bridge over the Mekong river in Vietnam. Construction will take 42 months.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is one of the cornerstones for growth in the group. Bilfinger currently has a 350-million mark contract to build Bangkok's first subway network, as well as a contract to build a 300-million mark motorway in the Thai capital.</p>
<p>The group said that it had no plans to expand through large acquisitions, but said it planned to increase its presence in target markets through the purchase of small and medium sized companies.</p>
<p>Group orders in hand rose 2.6 percent to 9.98 billion marks in the first four months of the year.</p>
