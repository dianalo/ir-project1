<p>Taiwan on Thursday said it wants to turn itself into a leading international sourcing centre for large international companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Through our 38 branch offices worldwide, we'll invite large international firms to Taiwan to discuss the possibility of purchasing Taiwan-made parts and components,&quot; said Ricky Kao, secretary-general of the China External Trade Development Council, the island's semi-official trade promotion body.</p>
<p>&quot;We will focus on promoting purchasing in the information technology, telecommunications, optoelectronics and electronics industries in the first year, and expand to other industries afterwards,&quot; Kao told a news conference.</p>
<p>Most of the world's large information technology companies have already established international procurement offices in Taiwan due to the growing stature of the island's information technology and electronics industry, he said.</p>
<p>In 1995, Taiwan exported more than US$40 billion worth of parts and components, Kao said.</p>
<p>The top 20 equipment companies from Japan and the United States purchased a total of $6.5 billion from Taiwan manufacturers last year, he added.</p>
<p>Taiwan's computer hardware industry, the world's third largest, is on track to grow 28.1 percent in 1996 to $24.174 billion from $18.871 billion in 1995, the semi-official Institute for Information Industry forecast in November.</p>
<p>For 1997, the council plans to add one more office in Southeast Asia to diversify markets and to strengthen ties under the structure of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Kao said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule in July 1997 will not affect the council's operation in the territory, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll continue our Hong Kong office's normal operation even after Hong Kong's return to communist China,&quot; Kao said.</p>
<p>But he said the council currently has no plan to set up branch offices in China.</p>
<p>Taipei said this month it would take no new steps to boost economic links with China, a reprisal for China's successful courtship of South Africa to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing in 1997.</p>
<p>China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Some 30,000 Taiwan-funded businesses have poured more than $20 billion into China since relations began to thaw in the late 1980s.</p>
