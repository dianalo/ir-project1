<headline>Snyder Oil says could make 1-4 acquisitions.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Snyder Oil Corp could make between one and four acquisitions worth a total of $400-600 million, chief executive John Snyder told a teleconference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company yesterday announced it would spin-off its 74 percent owned Patina Oil &amp; Gas Corp unit and Snyder said that if it realised investments in two London-listed affiliates it would have free cash for acquisitions.  </p>
<p>Snyder said that the Snyder Oil had $120 million in a credit line, marketable securities from its Cairn Energy and SOCO International Plc units worth around $150 million plus $100 million in cash from the Patina spinoff.</p>
<p>&quot;This represents a pretty formidable war chest for acquisitions, typically you can leverage your cash two-to-one, with $370 million you could buy something for $740 million,&quot; said Snyder.  </p>
<p>He added that Snyder &quot;would not want to do something that big as it would leave us with more leverage than we would be comfortable with&quot; and would look instead at up to $600 million, which would represent debt of three time annual cash flow.</p>
<p>Snyder said that the company was looking for a stable political and operating environment for any acquisitions and so would avoid certain countries overseas and some U.S. states such as Oklahoma, where strict environmental laws are in force.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have targeted to get this full cycle completed, including the redeployment of capital by the end of next year,&quot; Snyder said.</p>
<p>Snyder said that Patina accounted for 44 percent of consolidated production in the second quarter and its spin-off would reduce cash flow, output and reserves prior to any acquisitions.  </p>
<p>&quot;However, we have major development programs under way which would cause our production level from our core assets, excluding Patina, by the middle of next year to be about as much as we had with the entire company consolidated last year, which is about 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day,&quot; said Snyder.</p>
<p>In the second quarter Snyder, including Patina, produced 41,000 boe per day and after the Patina divestment, the figure would be around 23,000 boe per day.</p>
<p>Snyder is selling Patina via a public offering and sale of shares to the company and some of its management. Snyder said that some investors had been worried that it would be in the interest of Patina's management to buy those shares as cheaply as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the right to walk and will walk if the price is too low,&quot; said Snyder.</p>
<p>Snyder shares were up 1/8 at 19-1/2 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
