<p>An Israeli minister said on Wednesday his country would apologise to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat if it became evident two suicide bombers who killed 13 people in a Jerusalem market came from abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;If we know that the terrorists came from outside, we will apologise to Arafat,&quot; Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told the Arabic newspaper al-Ittihad on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A police spokeswoman confirmed Kahalani made the remark.</p>
<p>The identity of the attackers, who set off bombs that ripped through the central Mahane Yehuda market on July 30, is still unknown. More than 170 people were injured in the attack.</p>
<p>Israel suspended peace talks with the Palestinian Authority and demanded Arafat crack down on Islamic militants, insisting the Palestinian leader had not done enough to fight &quot;terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p>The Moslem militant Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups have killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994. Most suicide bombers have come from Israeli-ruled areas of the West Bank.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has said even if the bombers came from abroad, they had to be helped by Arab militants operating in Palestinian-ruled areas.</p>
<p>But PLO officials say they doubt the bombers came from Palestinian- or Israeli-controlled areas.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that yes, there is no final, clear-cut evidence about the identity but there are signals,&quot; said Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to Arafat.</p>
<p>&quot;They were carrying foreign currency in their pockets. There was some indication about the shirt of one of them that can be directed towards the fact that they were not from here,&quot; he told foreign journalists.</p>
<p>Previous bombings have been followed by large wakes at the homes of bombers' families in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and Tibi said the absence of funerals is evidence the bombers came from abroad.</p>
<p>Pictures of the perpetrators printed in the Arabic press drew no response, and one Israeli official said the authorities did not have the bombers' fingerprints on record.</p>
<p>A leaflet claimed responsibility for the militant group Hamas, but both PLO and Israeli officials say they had doubts about its authenticity, citing strange language.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Arafat was allowing the Hamas infrastructure to operate on his territory, leading to the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;This infrastructure is situated, organised and operates within the areas of the Palestinian Authority,&quot; he told reporters this week.</p>
<p>A Hamas spokesman told the Egyptian weekly al-Musawwar that confusion over who carried out the attacks means its planners do not want to be known.</p>
<p>Tibi said he would welcome an apology from Netanyahu if the bombers came from outside.</p>
<p>&quot;They should express apologies personally to Yasser Arafat by Benjamin Netanyahu and to the Palestinian people and pay compensation to the Palestinian Authority because of all this economic loss...through this cruel siege,&quot; he said,</p>
<p>Israel has barred thousands of Palestinian workers from entering Israel since last week's bombing. They have arrested close to 200 Palestinians, and have frozen the transfer of 70 million shekels in tax payments they owe the authority.</p>
<p>Palestinians have condemned the measures as collective punishment that weakens Arafat and strengthens extremist forces. But Israel says the measures are necessary to prevent more suicide attacks.</p>
