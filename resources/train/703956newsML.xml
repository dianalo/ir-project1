<p>Shimano American Corp. is recalling more than one million cranks installed on bicycles in North America after receiving reports of over 630 cranks breaking, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The crank is used to connect the pedal to the frame of the bike, and if it breaks, the rider's legs can be injured by contact with the broken crank or by losing control of the bike. Shimano received 22 reports of injuries including cuts and fractures.</p>
<p>The cranks were installed on more than 200 models of bicycles manufactured since 1994 and sold under at least 49 brand names. The cranks are numbered FC-CT90, FC-M290, and FC-MC12, the commission said.</p>
<p>Consumers should check their bicycle's crank assemblies and if they find the affected cranks, stop using their bicycles immediately, the commission said.</p>
<p>Shimano American, a subsidiary of Japanese company Shimano , can be reached at 800-353-4719 to arrange for free replacement and installation of a new crank assembly.</p>
<p>Among the 49 bicycle brands that may have installed Shimano cranks were Bianchi, Fisher, Fuji, Huffy, L.L. Bean, Maxam, Performance, Peugeot, Raleigh, Roadmaster, Ross, Schwinn, Timberline and Trek.</p>
<p>Other brands also may have installed Shimano cranks, the CPSC said, urging all consumers to check their bicycles.</p>
