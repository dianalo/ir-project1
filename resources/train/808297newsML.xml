<p>The Mexican army has withdrawn troops from areas in southeastern Chiapas state near where Zapatista guerrillas are holed up, witnesses said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Zapatistas have been surrounded by the army for nearly two years during on-off peace negotiations with the government.</p>
<p>Rebel complaints of the extensive military presence were partly responsible for a break-off in talks late last year.</p>
<p>Media reports speculated the troop withdrawal might be aimed at bringing the rebels back to the negotiating table to find a permanent solution issues raised by the uprising they launched for democracy and indian rights in Jan. 1994.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters reporter who witnessed the scene, as well as local residents, three former military camps close to the town of San Andres Larrainzar -- site of the stalled peace neogitations -- were vacated.</p>
<p>San Andres Larrainzar is about 15 miles (24 km) north of San Cristobal de las Casas, the colonial city where the rebels launched their uprising in a 10-day burst of fighting more than three years ago.</p>
<p>Spokesmen at the Seventh Military Zone in San Cristobal de las Casas would not comment on the troop movements on Monday.</p>
<p>However, local commander Gen. Mario Renan Castillo announced last week that 5,000 soldiers in the areas of conflict would be relieved.</p>
<p>The troop withdrawl occured about two weeks before President Ernesto Zedillo's state of the nation address on Sept. 1. Mexican newspapers said it could be a peace initiative extended to the Zapatistas.</p>
<p>The troops apparently moved out quietly in the middle of the night late last week.</p>
<p>&quot;By the time we noticed, they had already burned their shacks and destroyed their trenches,&quot; Joaquin Gomez, who lives near the former San Cayetano camp, said. &quot;They took out all their tanks in the middle of the night.&quot;</p>
<p>Witnesses could see the charred remains of abandoned army camps in San Cayetano, Jalnochoj and Santiago Pinar, with tracks from tanks and armored vehicles leading away from the camps. Local journalists also reported a withdrawal from a major camp in the town of Chanal.</p>
<p>Mexican troops flooded this poor, tropical state following the surprise uprising.</p>
<p>Before the withdrawal, there were 40,000 troops in 250 camps in 80 of the 111 municipalities in Chiapas, according to a coalition of non-governmental peace groups known as Conpaz.</p>
