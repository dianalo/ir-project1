<p>Singapore shares ended almost unchanged on Monday with investors sidelined as the corporate reporting season rolled on.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers are sidelined because of the reporting season,&quot; a dealer at a local broking house said.</p>
<p>Dealers said U.S. inflation and Singapore export data, due Wednesday and Thursday respectively, also had an impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the figures get out of the way at the end of the week, we'll have uncertainty hanging over us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index ended a fraction lower, slipping 0.23 points to close at 2,135.23.</p>
<p>Traded volume was an uninspiring 196.2 million shares which saw losers outstrip gainers by 311 to 82.</p>
<p>The day's most traded counter was debut stock Gul Technologies, which hit an early high of Singapore $0.90 -- a 55 percent premium on its offer price of S$0.58.</p>
<p>Gul ended the day at S$0.79 on volume of 15.7 million units.</p>
<p>Gainers were led by North Borneo Timber, which ended up S$0.80 at a year high of S$9.15. Losers were topped by First Capital warrants, ending down S$0.62 at S$2.36.</p>
