<p>Reports that Margaret Thatcher is impressed by Tony Blair highlights an uncomfortable truth for Britain's ruling Conservatives -- Thatcher probably has more in common with the Labour leader than Prime Minister John Major.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Thatcher is said to have told the editor of the Times newspaper at a private gathering that, if Blair won power at the next general election, due by May 22 at the latest, &quot;he won't let Britain down&quot;.</p>
<p>Her office quickly denied the story and party officials, anxious to patch up yet another hole in the leaking Conservative ship, said Thatcher had vowed to work &quot;ferociously&quot; for Major's re-election.</p>
<p>But the reports highlighted that Thatcher and Blair share many attributes. They value leadership, determination and vision highly -- and they don't rate Major as a leader.</p>
<p>Thatcher vowed to destroy socialism and, by winning three elections as Conservative prime minister, succeeded in forcing the Labour Party to rethink its philosophy and political aims.</p>
<p>Without the Iron Lady, still an icon to Conservative right-wingers, there would have been no need for Blair. He has steadily moved Labour to the centre ground of politics and built a huge lead in opinion polls on the back of his party reforms.</p>
<p>Ousted as leader by the ruling party in 1990, Thatcher, 71, still believes socialism is a &quot;pernicious notion&quot;. But she has acknowledged that Blair, 43, is a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>The &quot;grey man&quot; of British politics, Major, who will be 54 on March 29, spent the first three years of his premiership which began in late 1990 trying to step out of Thatcher's huge shadow. He has spent the rest being outshone by Blair's telegenic smile and New Labour's moderate lure.</p>
<p>Blair says Thatcher's emphasis on enterprise and her breaking up of vested interests made her a radical, rather than a Conservative. As prime minister, he wants to be a radical of the centre ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Margaret Thatcher forced the opposition to face realities in modern social and political life. Ironically, Tony Blair may be the inheritor of her success,&quot; historian Lord Blake says.</p>
<p>To most Labour voters, however, the woman who ruled Britain for 11 years was the prime minister who broke the trade unions, caused massive unemployment and looked after the rich of society rather than its poor. But to Blair, Thatcher is also a politician to be admired -- not for her policies but for her way of doing things.</p>
<p>Blair has duplicated Thatcher's &quot;warrior&quot; approach to bulldoze aside the left-wing of his party and persuade voters that Labour is now a party of moderation. Like her, Blair believes ruthlessness is an essential weapon in politics.</p>
<p>&quot;She was a thoroughly determined person and that is an admirable quality,&quot; Blair said in April 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important in politics to have a clear sense of direction, to know what you want. Even though you may get blown off course, you should always have a clear set of objectives.&quot;</p>
<p>Blair has even dared to call himself her natural heir, claiming that only New Labour can complete the &quot;economic and social revolution&quot; she began.</p>
<p>Thatcher in turn sees Blair as the most &quot;formidable&quot; Labour leader for 30 years. &quot;I see a lot of socialism behind (Labour's) front bench but not in Mr Blair. I think he genuinely has moved,&quot; she said in May 1995. &quot;He says he believes the things he is advocating and I believe he does.&quot; The mutual admiration society serves Blair more than it does the Iron Lady. His praise of her gritty personal qualities throws Major's deficiencies as a leader into sharp relief.</p>
<p>Thatcher's oblique attacks on Major have died away in recent months as he has moved nearer to her sceptical stance on the benefits of the European Union.</p>
<p>But the failings of Major's government, which is seen by voters as tired, out of touch and accident-prone, are unlikely to find favour with a woman renowned for her conviction.</p>
