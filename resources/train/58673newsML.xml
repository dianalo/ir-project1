<p>U.S. Plains cattle trade was slow late Tuesday morning, with small number of steers selling in Kansas at $72.00 per cwt, steady with Monday's thin activity, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 200 head were reported sold in Kansas, and no sales were reported in the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma area, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most are waiting for higher prices later in the week,&quot; a Kansas feedlot operator said.</p>
<p>Packers were bidding $72.00 and owners generally were asking $74.00.</p>
<p>However, some cattle feeders said they expect sales at $73.00 Wednesday or Thursday, sources said.  </p>
<p>Feedlot cattle prices this week were expected steady to $1.00 higher at $72.00 to $73.00 amid ideas that strong boxed beef demand would continue to give packers incentive to pay up for live inventories.</p>
<p>Prices also were seen firm on tight supplies of market-ready cattle at the feedlots, cattle feeders said.</p>
