<p>A fourth man targeted by a police crackdown on child sex abuse committed suicide on Saturday as France's revulsion at paedophilia was tinged with misgivings about an orgy of public shaming.</p>
<p>A 39-year-old teacher, placed under investigation by a magistrate on Friday on suspicion of taking pornographic photographs of minors, leapt to his death from a bridge in the southern city of Bordeaux, police sources said.</p>
<p>He was the fourth man to kill himself after 2,500 French police this week raided the homes of hundreds of people who had ordered videos from a mail-order company in the central city of Macon, normally best known for its Burgundy wines.</p>
<p>Police said he was not apparently linked to the network exposed by the biggest-ever operation in France against child sex abuse. Three other men have hanged themselves.</p>
<p>Minister of Youth Marie-George Buffet pledged to reinforce controls at schools, youth clubs and summer camps after the discovery that teachers formed one of the biggest groups among 210 people placed under formal investigation after the raids.</p>
<p>Several clergymen were also targeted.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministry has been very vigilant for a long time. We will reinforce that,&quot; Buffet told the daily France-Soir.</p>
<p>But the mounting death toll has triggered criticisms that France has gone too far in a public witchhunt of suspects -- none of whom has been tried.</p>
<p>&quot;These huge anti-paedophile raids are scandalous, they destroy and dishonour people,&quot; said Henri Leclerc, head of the League of Human Rights. &quot;We must keep a sense of proportion.&quot;</p>
<p>He said people buying videos involving child sex were not comparable with such figures as Belgium's Marc Dutroux and Patrick Derochette, between them accused of abusing and murdering five young girls.</p>
<p>An unemployed, 37-year-old handicapped man killed himself in Givors, near Lyon, on Friday. He had been detained during the police investigation but released for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>An unnamed 48-year-old bachelor, an executive at an arms factory in central France, hanged himself on Thursday. &quot;I can't take it. Forgive me, big kisses to the family,&quot; the daily Liberation said he wrote in a suicide note.</p>
<p>And a postal inspector in his 40s was also found hanged at his home in the eastern town of Saint-Martin-d'Heres on Thursday after police questioned him about pornography at his home.</p>
<p>The French daily Le Monde said on Saturday in a commentary entitled &quot;To Die of Shame&quot; that the suicides &quot;raised fears...that we have gone from one danger to another, from the era of silence to that of branding with a red-hot iron&quot;.</p>
<p>The suspected ringleader, Bernard Alapetite, the 47-year-old head of a Paris publishing house, is among about 20 people in pre-trial detention.</p>
<p>Police said Alapetite copied foreign child sex videos -- featuring rapes of boys aged under 15 and even sex with animals -- and sold them for 800 francs ($140) each.</p>
