<p>China will crack down on illegal radio stations and pager networks, saying greater controls over radio services were needed to ensure state security, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;China will strengthen the management over radio services throughout the country in a move to safeguard state security and promote economic development,&quot; Xinhua quoted Vice-premier Zou Jiahua as saying.</p>
<p>The growing use of radio technology in China had caused chaos in the management of the industry, Zou said without elaborating.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a must to adopt administrative, legal, technological and economic means to manage and make use of frequency resources,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Radio management authorities should severely punish unauthorised radio stations and step up controls over the production and sale of radio transmitters, Xinhua quoted Wu Jichuan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, as saying.</p>
<p>China would set up a nationwide radio frequency management computer network and radio monitoring system by the year 2000, Zou said.</p>
<p>China had 40 million pager users by November 1996, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Airline pilots flying into Hong Kong have complained of persistent radio frequency interference, blamed on mobile phones and pagers used on illegal frequencies in China's neighbouring Guangdong province.</p>
<p>Chinese airlines have banned the use of mobile telephones, personal computers, electronic games and other electronic equipment on flights, from January 1.</p>
<p>Looser controls across China with the implementation of economic reform since the late 1970s have contributed to a flood of radio stations, seen by Beijing's propaganda tsars as a challenge to their sway over the airwaves.</p>
