<headline>Fred Meyer to buy Smith's Food - WSJ.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>Fred Meyer Inc, a diversified retailer, has agreed to acquire Smith's Food &amp; Drug Centers Inc for about $720 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The Journal's electronic edition on Monday said Fred Meyer also would assume about $1.3 billion of Smith's debt, much of which is related to last year's leveraged recapitalization arranged by Yucaipa Cos, an investment firm.</p>
<p>Neither company could be reached immediately by Reuters.  </p>
<p>The merger is valued at $44-a-share for Smith's shareholders. It would create a grocery-and-retailing chain in the Western part of the U.S. with about $6.8 billion in revenue.</p>
<p>Smith's Chief Executive Ronald Burkle, who also is the head of Yacaipa, is to become chairman of the combined company. Fred Meyer's chairman and chief executive, Robert Miller, is to become president and chief executive of the new company.</p>
<p>Fred Meyer would control seven of 11 board seats.</p>
<p>Yucaipa now owns about 14 percent of Smith's stock. After the merger, it would hold a five percent stake.</p>
<p>&quot;It's accretive in the first full year, and we're confident our shareholders will look favorably on the transaction,&quot; Miller was quoted by the Journal as saying.</p>
<p>Smith's shareholders are to receive 1.05 shares of Fred Meyer for each share owned.</p>
<p>Fred Meyer has 222 stores in 17 states, while Smith's has 151 locations in seven states.</p>
