<p>Aftershocks persist nearly a year on from the Sumitomo copper scandal that shook metals markets, as prices soar despite predictions of a supply surplus this year.</p>
<p>Short-term production threats and low inventories are underpinning a heated market, but a roll-on effect of the Sumitomo affair is mostly blamed for a supply squeeze that has seen prices spiral up by about $150 recently.</p>
<p>But when long-term fundamentals come to the fore, the market could be in for a big tumble, some analysts said.</p>
<p>Large players such as U.S. investment banks or European merchants are said to be keeping a tight grip on the market in an operation linked to leftover positions from Sumitomo's fallen star trader Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a technically based squeeze,&quot; said analyst Angus MacMillan of broker Billiton. &quot;It's the aftershocks of the Hamanaka earthquake to some extent that are still being felt in the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour unrest and stoppages at major mines and smelters are making people reluctant to sell, but they are not seen as the principal force behind rising prices.</p>
<p>A small group of workers at Chile's Escondida, at 800,000 tonnes a year the world's largest copper mine, voted on Wednesday to continue a strike and the management of Phelps Dodge in the U.S. gave a final wage offer to miners who have been working without a contract for 10 months.</p>
<p>In addition, a Kennecott Corp smelter in Utah is shut for six weeks of planned maintenance while workers at Cominco Ltd's Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile are set to reject a pay offer this weekend.</p>
<p>Zambia's state-owned ZCCM said that April output could be slashed to 9,457 tonnes from an originally estimated 27,057 tonnes by a shortarge of fuel supplies to smelters.</p>
<p>&quot;The production problems are merely playing into the hands of whoever is long and squeezing the market,&quot; said Robin Bhar, analyst with broker Brandeis. In a worst case scenario the market could lose 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of output, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper is available in the physical market and those premiums have not moved in the same way as the premiums on the LME.&quot;</p>
<p>Copper for delivery in three months roared up on the London Metal Exchange from about $2,250 per tonne last week to nearly $2,400 on Thursday.</p>
<p>As players scrambled to cover exposed positions, the premium of cash copper over three months delivery material has surged from about $30 to over $200.</p>
<p>Some of those who are on the wrong side of the market were said to have been hit in late January when the premium of cash over three months metal rocketed to $312.</p>
<p>They rolled over their positions, hoping when they matured three months later the tightness would evaporate, but are now being hit again.</p>
<p>Hamanaka -- on trial in Japan for fraud after Sumitomo said last June his unauthorised trades were responsible for $2.6 billion in losses -- was a huge player in the copper market.</p>
<p>He was called &quot;Mr Five-Percent&quot; for the amount of the world's copper supply he was said to control.</p>
<p>&quot;It was always known that some of his positions extended far forward three or four years,&quot; said Bhar, who said the LME tightness would likely last about two weeks, following the pattern of previous squeezes.</p>
<p>The short-term tightness has been making itself felt in falling inventory levels at LME warehouses, which are down more than one-third at 146,750 tonnes since late February.</p>
<p>They are above, however, the six-year low of 92,475 tonnes seen last November.</p>
<p>But if a string of new mines start churning out metal as expected and stocks begin rising again, the market could be in for a nasty fall.</p>
