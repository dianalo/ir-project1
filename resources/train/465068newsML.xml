<title>GERMANY: German grain intervention offers led by feed rye.</title>
<headline>German grain intervention offers led by feed rye.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-03-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Some 37,844 tonnes of feed rye was offered into German intervention stores last week after 29,748 tonnes a week earlier, state intervention board BLE data showed on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said European markets no longer appeared to be requiring feed rye while feed wheat was still sought after.</p>
<p>Barley was offered for intervention in regions far away from key consumption centres in the livestock industry, for example in eastern Germany, where there was also a concentration of feed rye offers.</p>
<p>Some wheat offers were seen in Lower Saxony state.</p>
<p>But totals in the November-May 1996/97 intervention season lag those in the same 95/96 period.</p>
<p>Total grain volumes offered by March 21 totalled 838,777 tonnes compared with 1,593,956 tonnes a year earlier.</p>
<p>The March buying-in price for all grains is 243.68 marks a tonne.</p>
<p>The offers are volumes that were accepted, but have not yet been delivered to stores, by the close last Friday.</p>
<p>Sellers may withdraw offers and BLE may refuse acceptance on quality grounds.</p>
<p>BLE gave the following breakdown in tonnes --</p>
<p>		   March 21, 1997  March 17, 1997  March 21, 1996</p>
<p>    soft wheat    57,250	  50,220		9,750</p>
<p>    rye	    502,525	 464,681	    915,091</p>
<p>    barley	 277,292	 269,806	    669,115</p>
<p>    maize	    1,710	   1,710		---</p>
<p>    TOTAL	  838,777	 786,417	  1,593,956</p>
