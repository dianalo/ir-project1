<headline>Qatar says Bahrain military pilot seeking asylum.</headline>
<dateline>DOHA 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Bahraini military pilot sought political asylum in neighbouring Qatar on Monday after landing his helicopter in the capital Doha, the official Qatar News Agency (QNA) said.</p>
<p>It quoted a Qatar foreign ministry source as saying First Lieutenant Nasser Majed Nasser al-Khalifa arrived at Doha International Airport at 4 p.m. (1300 GMT). It added officials were considering his appeal.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the pilot belonged to Bahrain's al-Khalifa ruling family.</p>
<p>Bahrain's official Gulf News Agency said military authorities were searching for a Bahraini royal air force helicopter, which had departed from Manama at 2.50 p.m. (1150 GMT). It said the chopper was on a training flight, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Qatar and Bahrain, two tiny Gulf Arab states, are locked in a dispute over a number of islands and reefs in the strategic waterway. Manama has controlled the potentially oil and gas-rich territories since the 1930s, but they are also claimed by Qatar.</p>
<p>Ties were further strained this month after Bahrain sentenced two alleged Qatari spies to three years in jail. Bahrain's Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa pardoned the two on Saturday. Doha, which had denied the two were spies, welcomed the move.</p>
