<p>China's revolutionary old guard has shared the limelight with President Jiang Zemin for the triumphant recovery of Hong Kong in a public display seen as smoothing the way for a crucial Communist Party meeting.</p>
<p>Among the most surprising of the old veterans to emerge at the Hong Kong ceremonies was former president Yang Shangkun, rarely seen in Beijing since he was purged by his late comrade-in-arms Deng Xiaoping in 1992 when he tried to step into Deng's shoes.</p>
<p>As Jiang presided over gala celebrations that marked the end of 156 years of British rule over Hong Kong, many powerful party veterans who had all but disappeared from public view were allowed to bask in the official Communist Party glow.</p>
<p>&quot;Jiang is giving 'face' to a lot of people,&quot; said a foreign political analyst on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They are riding the big boat to the 15th party congress,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China's ruling communist elite holds its key gathering later this year to set policies and personnel changes for the next five years.</p>
<p>While Jiang wields additional power as party chief and head of the Central Military Commission, diplomats and analysts said he was taking no chances and shoring up support ahead of the meeting where he will be looking to gain new posts for his political allies.</p>
<p>In a system where revolutionary credentials can empower retired veterans until they die, Jiang may need the backing of even elder statesmen to get his way.</p>
<p>The most influential elders to attend the Hong Kong ceremonies were former president Yang along with his half-brother and Politburo member Yang Baibing.</p>
<p>They were quietly purged of real power in 1992 and banished from the capital after an abortive power grab that paramount leader Deng feared could pose a challenge to his hand-picked successor Jiang. Deng died in February, aged 92.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, when the 90-year-old Yang appeared on a huge video screen at Beijing's Workers' Stadium where some 80,000 people had assembled to watch the celebrations -- an audible gasp echoed through the stands.</p>
<p>Yang was also shown on state television earlier in the day, chatting amiably with party leaders at a banquet thrown by Premier Li Peng in honour of the recovery of the territory lost to the British under the 1842 treaty that ended the Opium War.</p>
<p>Other elderly veterans attending the public festivities ideologue Deng Liqun -- who has crossed swords with Jiang over economic policy -- as well as old-style technocrat Bo Yibo and former military man Chen Xilian among others.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole nation across the political spectrum is celebrating the recovery of Hong Kong,&quot; said a Western diplomat. &quot;They all want to be in on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuesday's festivities were only part of the lavish celebrations marking the historic return of sovereignty over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 people were invited to watch the final countdown to the territory's recovery capped by a barrage of fireworks in Beijing's Tiananmen Square at the stroke of midnight on Monday.</p>
<p>The celebrations coincided with the 76th birthday of the Communist Party, which quickly claimed credit for the territory's return.</p>
