<headline>Australia GST support doubled in six years - poll.</headline>

<p>Support for a goods and services tax (GST) in Australia has almost doubled in the past six years, according to a newspaper poll published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Australian newspaper's Newspoll found that 45 percent of voters supported a GST, compared with 27 percent in June 1991 when the conservative Liberal Party first adopted the concept.</p>
<p>The poll showed only 33 percent of voters now rejected a GST, compared with 58 percent in mid-1991.</p>
<p>It found 22 percent of voters were undecided.</p>
<p>&quot;The survey provides a dramatic boost to (Prime Minister) John Howard's plans to sell the new tax,&quot; the newspaper said.  </p>
<p>The poll showed the strongest backing for a GST came from Liberal-National coalition supporters, voters from households with high annual incomes, and full-time workers.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Howard endorsed the possibility of a GST as the government began a formal campaign for tax reform with the launch of an inquiry into the issue.</p>
<p>He also promised to produce a tax policy before the next election due by mid-1999.</p>
<p>The GST was blamed for the coalition's failure to oust the Labor government in 1993 after 13 years, despite the poll being viewed as an unloseable election.  </p>
<p>The Newspoll surveyed 1,147 voters around the country by telephone over the last weekend.</p>
