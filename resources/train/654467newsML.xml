<title>GERMANY: German convicted in Austria's Lucona fraud.</title>
<headline>German convicted in Austria's Lucona fraud.</headline>

<p>A north German court convicted a 62-year-old German of complicity in murder and insurance fraud on Wednesday for his role in the 1977 sinking of an Austrian ship, the Lucona, in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>After one of the longest murder trials in German history, the state court in Kiel sentenced Hans Peter Daimler to five years in jail for helping a leading Viennese socialite, Udo Proksch, to sink the ship, which Proksch had chartered as part of a $50 million insurance fraud.</p>
<p>Six crew members were killed in the blast on the Lucona. A Vienna court had already convicted Proksch in 1992 of masterminding the insurance swindle, and sentenced him to life in jail.</p>
<p>Kiel judge Uwe Martensen said the five-year trial had produced sufficient evidence to show that Proksch and Daimler had tried to insure the Lucona as extensively as possible before it was sunk.</p>
<p>The Austrian investigation into Proksch, a former swineherd who owned Vienna's elite Demel coffee house, included a multi-million dollar investigation involving a deep-sea search for the freighter. The investigation concluded it was blown up from inside.</p>
<p>The Lucona affair also prompted the resignation of  former Austrian foreign minister Leopold Gratz, who was found guilty of perjury over his role in the affair.</p>
