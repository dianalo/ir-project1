<p>Shares in Loewen Group Inc extended a recent slide on Tuesday as investors anticipated a stock offering from the funeral home operator in coming months, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>Loewen was off 5/8 at 28-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange after breaching the closely watched 30 threshhold last Friday. In Toronto, the stock dropped 0.90 to 40.10, its lowest level since last summer.</p>
<p>The company filed a shelf registration last month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for US$1 billion in stock and debt offerings, which it said should cover one to two years of its financing needs.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said today that expectations of an offering soon were depressing Loewen shares, as were general market weakness and investor jitters.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the stock has been under pressure due to the overhang of stock offerings. And there's the overall market pullback too,&quot; one New York trader said.</p>
<p>A company spokesman had no immediate comment on the stock weakness. Loewen's chief financial officer and investor relations specialist were meeting with major institutions this week in the United States.</p>
<p>Traders said the series of meetings seemed to add credence to talk that a stock issue might be forthcoming within the next month or two.</p>
<p>Raymond James analyst Susan Little said the meetings might be aimed at testing investor appetite for a share offering. The share price weakness signalled &quot;investors are anticipating an equity offering in the near future.&quot;</p>
