<p>British rock band Bush, virtual unknowns in their own country, held the top spot on the U.S. album charts for the second consecutive week, according to sales data released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rock quartet's album, &quot;Razorblade Suitcase,&quot; the follow- up to their multi-platinum debut, &quot;Sixteen Stone,&quot; sold over 200,000 copies in the week ended December 1. Its first week sales were almost 294,000. The band becomes the first rock act to spend two weeks at number one since Pearl Jam did in the two weeks ended September 8 with &quot;No Code.&quot;</p>
<p>Bush are signed to Los Angeles-based Trauma Records, which had the number two record with &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; from southern California rockers No Doubt. In its 48th week, the album sold almost 198,000 copies and insiders expect it to take the number one position next week.</p>
<p>Bush's song, &quot;Swallowed,&quot; has spent four weeks at the top of Billboard magazine's modern rock chart, which is based on radio play. &quot;Sixteen Stone,&quot; which peaked at three last year, is now at 88 in its 99th week on the main album charts.</p>
<p>Trauma is 50 percent owned by Interscope Records, an affiliate of Seagram Co Ltd's MCA Music.</p>
