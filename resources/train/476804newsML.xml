<p>Net profits posted by Indocement, a major Indonesian cement manufacturer, in 1996 are above market estimates and installation of additional production capacity in 1997 and 1998 should keep the company in good stead, analysts said.</p>
<p>PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa announced it booked a net profit of 551.49 billion rupiah in 1996. Analysts said the market consensus for the figure was 549.4 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;The (net profit) result of Indocement for 1996 is slightly above our expectations of about 523 billion rupiah,&quot; Stephanus Partono, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Singapore, told Reuters.</p>
<p>However, Partono said the company had instituted changes in its accounting system in 1996 which partially accounted for the above-expectation earnings.</p>
<p>Aside from changes in the accounting method, he also said the stable growth of the company's food division at about 15 percent per year had contributed to earnings growth.</p>
<p>Partono said he expected Indocement's cement division to imrove its performance in 1997 and 1998 due to additional capacity from two new plants in West Java and Kalimantan.</p>
<p>Company officials were not available for comment. Partono said Indofood's new West Java plant, with an annual capacity of 1.3 million tonnes, would start operations in April while the one in Kalimantan, with an annual capacity of 2.4 million tonnes, would start operations in August 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth of its cement division in 1996 was not too exciting as volume growth and price increases were relatively small. But in 1997 and 1998, its cement division should pick up due to additional capacity,&quot; Partono said.</p>
<p>However, Partono said he expected Indocement to perform only in line with the broader market and not exceed it.</p>
<p>&quot;If we break up the value of Indocement into two divisions, cement and food, the cement business is undervalued,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that currently it trades at a price earnings of 9.1 times its 1997 earnings compared with Semen Gresik which trades at 12 times 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;So, its cement business appears to be undervalued relative to other cement companies. But investors prefer to hold Gresik and Cibinong because they are pure cement plays,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Partono said it was hard to make a fair valuation for Indocement because it could not be considered a pure cement stock or a pure food stock.</p>
<p>The Jakarta bourse was closed on Monday because it was the last day of the 1996/97 fiscal year and will reopen on Tuesday.</p>
