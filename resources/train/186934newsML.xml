<headline>IBCA affirms Belgium's AA+ longterm rating.</headline>

<p>European credit rating agency IBCA on Wednesday affirmed its AA+ long-term foreign currency rating for Belgium.</p>
<p>It said this applied to senior and unsecured sovereign debt issues and sets a ceiling for all other Belgian issuers.</p>
<p>IBCA also affirmed its A1+ rating for Belgian short term issues and AAA for local currency issues.  </p>
<p>The agency said Belgium, a member of the European Union's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) since the late 1970s, had a record of low inflation and currency stability that made it a likely candidate for the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>&quot;With inflation around two percent and a general government deficit close to the required three percent, the only question mark concerns the level of public debt,&quot; IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately at 134 percent of GDP last year this is not only more than double the Maastricht limit but far higher than that of any other potential EMU member.&quot;</p>
<p>It said the government's austerity programme was a positive sign but slow growth, high unemployment and an ageing population were complicating any progress.</p>
<p>&quot;Although public finances are less vulnerable to an interest rate shock than in the early 1990s, much will depend on the government's ability to sustain a sufficiently large primary surplus until well after 1999,&quot; IBCA swaid.</p>
<p>It said the introduction of bonds with longer maturities had deepened the market for Belgian government debt and made it more attractive to external investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The capital account remains sensitive to interest and exchange rate movements but recent financial market reforms have increased the attractiveness of BEF assets for external investors,&quot; IBCA said</p>
<p>It said thanks partly to constitutional reforms, Flemish separatism was no longer a serious threat.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent scandal over political involvement in the judiciary is likely to prompt a reform of the legal system but should not endanger the unity of the state.&quot;</p>
