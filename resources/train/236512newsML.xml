<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Political violence still dogs KwaZulu-Natal.</title>

<p>Violence monitors said on Thursday about 27 people were killed last month in political feuding in South Africa's Zulu heartland and warned against too much optimism after a recent lull in the violence.</p>
<p>The independent watchdog Human Rights Committee (HRC) said the November death toll was down on September's 39 and October's 31. It was also down from 37 in November of last year.</p>
<p>But HRC researcher Makubetse Sekhonyane said a fragile truce between President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) should be treated cautiously as the Christmas holidays drew closer.</p>
<p>He said thousands of migrant workers returned to the KwaZulu-Natal province for holidays from Johannesburg mines, some with grudges and keen to settle old scores.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be cautious. Last year in November a lull was followed by an eruption of political violence in December. Our history shows that the situation here could still change within a short space time if we are not careful,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Eighteen people were killed on Christmas Day 1995 on the KwaZulu-Natal's south coast when hordes of men rampaged through an ANC settlement of Shobashobane killing, burning and looting.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Bala Naidoo said despite the lull in political feuding, security forces were drawing up plans for deployment to prevent any trouble in the province.</p>
<p>More than 14,000 people have died in political violence between the ANC and IFP since the mid-1980s in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
