<p>Belarus will finally send the last of its former Soviet nuclear missiles to Russia on Tuesday, President Alexander Lukashenko said on Sunday.</p>
<p>On Friday, Belarus officials, including a top presidential aide, said the last missiles had left the republic's territory -- several weeks ahead of a year-end deadline set as part of a deal that gave Russia control of the ex-Soviet nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>They are to be decommissioned by the Russian strategic missile command, which is responsible for removing them.</p>
<p>&quot;On November 26, in two days time, according to my information, the last missiles are due to leave Belarussian territory,&quot; Lukashenko said. &quot;Though it does not depend on us, rather on those who will remove them.&quot;</p>
<p>An official of Russia's strategic missile command told Itar-Tass news agency it was still in the process of removing the Belarus missiles but that they would all go by the year end.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, speaking to reporters after casting his ballot in a controversial referendum, said there would be a ceremony to mark the transfer of the last missile across the Russian border.</p>
<p>Belarus Security Council spokesman Vasily Baranov had raised alarm by telling Interfax news agency on Saturday that there were still 14 nuclear missiles in Belarus.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, whose quest for new powers through the referendum has put him at loggerheads with parliament, once threatened to keep a final 18 SS-25 strategic missiles as a bargaining chip against NATO's plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>Belarus, a republic of 10 million sandwiched between Russia and Poland, was the only former Soviet state outside Russia still to have missiles on its soil. They were under Russian control and could not be launched without Moscow's order.</p>
