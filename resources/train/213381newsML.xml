<p>Conrail Inc, in launching its quest for shareholder approval of its merger with CSX Corp, said a second tender offer by CSX Corp, for 20.1 percent of Conrail shares, could begin after December 2.</p>
<p>It also said a key block of shareholder votes, shares held by an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, would be reduced because most of the shares were submitted in the first tender offer for 19.9 percent of the shares.  </p>
<p>Conrail made the disclosures in proxy materials mailed to shareholders, seeking approval of a change the company's charter to permit the stock-swap portion of its proposed merger with CSX.</p>
<p>Conrail also said &quot;substantially all&quot; of the shares in an Employee Benefits Trust and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) tendered their shares in the first CSX tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail.</p>
<p>The acceptance rate in the tender was 23 percent of shares offered.  </p>
<p>This reduces the voting power of shares held in the ESOP plan to 10.6 percent from 7.8 percent, unless the ESOP trustee quickly buys more Conrail shares on the market, Conrail said.</p>
<p>Conrail said the Employee Benefits Trust, with a 4.7 percent voting stake before the tender, will use the proceeds from the first tender to acquire shares in the open market. This would increase its voting power, Conrail said.</p>
<p>It said shares in the trust will be voted in the same proportion as shares of the ESOP stock.</p>
<p>The shares represent a key block of uncommitted votes in the coming shareholder vote, which is expected to be close.  </p>
<p>CSX will be able to vote its 19.9 percent stake acquired in the first tender and will vote for the Conrail charter amendment, Conrail said.</p>
<p>Before the first tender offer closed, takeover stock specialists were estimated to hold around 20 percent of Conrail's stock and institutions were estimated to hold about 65 percent.</p>
<p>Some large shareholders have criticized the merger, saying a rival all-cash offer of $110 per share by Norfolk Southern Corp is superior. Norfolk Southern is urging Conrail shareholders to reject the charter amendment.  </p>
<p>The amendement would waive a Pennsylvania law enabling shareholders in a target company to demand immediate payment at similar terms for all shares once a company has bought 20 percent of a target firm, thus CSX would have to pay $110 cash -- the same terms Norfolk Southern has offered -- for all Conrail shares without the waiver.</p>
<p>Conrail officials testified in a U.S. District Court hearing last week that CSX was in danger of losing the shareholder vote if it did not increase its offer.  </p>
<p>An information agent for Norfolk Southern's tender offer testified at the same hearing that the vote would be close and hinge on the decisions of a handful of institutional shareholders. Most insitutional shareholders would appose the charter amendment, he said.</p>
<p>The witness, Alan Miller of proxy solitictation firm Georgeson and Co, also said the ESOP and employee benefit shares would usually be voted in line with management recommendations. But some traders, noting, for example, that fewer layoffs are projected if Norfolk Southern wins, have said that may not be the case in the Conrail merger.  </p>
<p>Conrail needs a majority of votes cast to approve the charter amendment and it said in its proxy materials that, if slightly more than 40 percent of all outstanding shares voted in favor of the proposal, it would probably win, due to the expectation some shares would not be voted at all.</p>
<p>The shareholder's meeting is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 23, in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Conrail said the shareholders meeting could be postponed, or adjourned, if votes were lacking to approve the charter amendment.</p>
<p>It also said the merger could still go ahead if shareholders approve the overall merger at a later meeting. But it said that without the charter amendment shareholders could not receive cash for the additional 20.1 percent stake until after the merger is consumated. The merger is expected not to be completed until early 1988.</p>
