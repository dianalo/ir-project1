<p>Australia's Karrie Webb said her game was close to perfection after she added a 70 to her first round 65 to lead with a nine under par 135 at the halfway stage of the British Open at Sunningdale on Friday.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old world number two, who has dropped only one shot in the 36 holes, finished three ahead of British pair Trish Johnson and Kathryn Marshall, with American Barb Mucha another shot back in third place on five under 139.</p>
<p>Webb, who won the title at Woburn two years ago, and went on to top the US LPGA Order of Merit in her rookie 1996 season, said: &quot;It's always tough to back up a good first round, and my putter wasn't quite so hot today.</p>
<p>&quot;But there's not one part of my game that I could improve at the moment -- it's all going great.&quot;</p>
<p>Marshall, a 30-year-old Scot, spectacularly holed a bunker shot for a birdie at the 18th for a 68 to raise her hopes of adding to her one professional victory, in the 1995 Jamie Farr Classic.</p>
<p>Johnson, who also shot 70, admitted she did not have Webb's power of concentration.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have her brainpower. Golf is everything to her; it's total tunnel vision.&quot; But she added: &quot;I just hope Karrie doesn't have too good a weekend. I would love to win the British Open.&quot;</p>
<p>Five weeks after they battled out a thrilling final round in the U.S. Open, the British version ended in disappointment for Britain's Alison Nicholas and American Nancy Lopez.</p>
<p>Nicholas, who triumphed at Pumpkin Ridge, Portland, Oregon shot a 74 and missed the cut by one on five over 149.</p>
<p>Forty-year-old Lopez fell awkwardly and injured her left elbow when she slipped on wood shavings at the 10th. She struggled on to come home in 40 for a 79 and 12 over par. &quot;It's very sore, and it did affect my game,&quot; she said before dissolving into tears in the arms of her husband, Ray Knight.</p>
