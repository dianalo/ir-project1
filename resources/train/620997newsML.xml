<title>USA: Intraday CSCE world sugar barely down, in range.</title>
<headline>Intraday CSCE world sugar barely down, in range.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE world sugar futures were slightly lower at midsession Wednesday after benchmark July failed to pierce its upside target in earlier trade.</p>
<p>The contract climbed to 11.20 cents, just under resistance pegged at 11.21 cents, amid light speculative buying. Steady trade selling knocked the contract off the high and below unchanged, where it lingered in light midsession activity.</p>
<p>At 1130 EDT, July stood 0.02 cent weaker at 11.14 cents per lb, having traded from 11.20 to 11.13. Second-position October was down 0.02 cent at 10.92 cents, while the rest of the board stood 0.03 to 0.01 weaker.</p>
<p>Market sources expect prices to drift within the recent trading range as a lack of inspiring news keeps interest thin.</p>
<p>&quot;People want to sell the rallies and buy the dips and there is no reason for them to do otherwise,&quot; a broker said. &quot;The price has suited the activity.&quot;</p>
<p>The trade was a noted seller of the July/October and the October/March spreads throughout the morning, while the funds have begun to slow their recent buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The funds have a decent long position. It's not overdone, but the market seems to be running out of steam,&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>Nearby support was seen between 11.05 and 11.00 cents basis July, followed by 10.85 cents.</p>
<p>Open interest in July stood at 75,248 lots as of early Tuesday, up 403 lots from the previous session.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 8,357 lots as of 1100 EDT.</p>
