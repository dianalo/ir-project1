<p>Gambians voted for a new parliament on Thursday in elections expected to consolidate the rule of President Yahya Jammeh who seized power in a coup in 1994 and won a disputed presidential poll last September.</p>
<p>Election officials and party leaders reported a slow turnout in the mainly Moslem West African nation's capital Banjul and other urban areas but brisker polling in the provinces.</p>
<p>There were no reports of trouble although main opposition leader Ousainou Darboe said one of his supporters had been arrested in the town of Basse in Upper River Division.</p>
<p>Jammeh, a 31-year-old soldier turned politician who toppled the former British colony's independence leader Sir Dawda Jawara accusing him of corruption, predicted a landslide win for his Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction.</p>
<p>&quot;My party will win 99 percent. Those who vote for the opposition are wasting their time, the opposition cannot do anything for them,&quot; he told reporters after voting.</p>
<p>Jammeh banned established politicians from politics before the presidential poll, denouncing their links with Jawara.</p>
<p>Opposition has since gathered around Darboe, a lawyer, and his United Democratic Party. Two minor opposition parties are also contesting seats along with six independents.</p>
<p>Darboe, who is not standing for parliament himself, took refuge in Senegal's embassy for several days during and after the presidential poll saying he feared for his safety.</p>
<p>Campaigning this time has been peaceful, although Darboe's party has complained of the arrest of party militants.</p>
<p>&quot;The PIEC (Provisional Independent Electoral Commission) is not doing a satisfactory job about organising the election,&quot; he told Reuters non Thursday, describing turnout as low.</p>
<p>The campaign focused on whether Jammeh or more established politicians should run the country, with Darboe accusing Jammeh of corruption. Jammeh dismissed the charge.</p>
<p>The Gambian parliament has 49 seats. Jammeh has the right to nominate four legislators, so 45 seats are up for election. Of these 45, five are already in the bag for the president because the opposition is fielding candidates only in 40 seats.</p>
<p>Jammeh's is the only party contesting all 45 seats.</p>
<p>More than 446,000 of Gambia's one million or so people are registered to vote.</p>
<p>Election officials said most of the 561 polling stations opened on time at 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) but there were few queues in the capital, unlike with past elections. Polls were to close at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT). First results were expected Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Gambia fronts the Atlantic and is surrounded by Senegal. Its economy is based on tourism, groundnuts and foreign aid.</p>
<p>Jammeh's coup estranged Western donors. Some advised nationals against visiting on security grounds, hitting tourism. Jammeh has since developed ties with Libya, Taiwan and Cuba.</p>
