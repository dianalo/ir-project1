<p>United Nations observers are scouring Iraq to ensure that food supplies reaching the country under the oil-for-food deal with the United Nations are equitably distributed, U.N. officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They are now focusing on remote areas, areas which were thought to be sensitive. Some of them have gone deep into remote countryside, villages in Iraq's southern marshes,&quot; one official, refusing to be named said.</p>
<p>About 143 international observers are now deployed in the southern and central parts of Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;The have been operating in satisfactory conditions. Their approach is to be fair but firm,&quot; Eric Falt, spokesman for the U.N. coordinator in Iraq told Reuters.</p>
<p>The deployment of these observers, their freedom of movement and means of communications were among the thorniest issues that held up the implementation of the oil deal for Iraq for a long time.</p>
<p>Now it seems both U.N. and Iraq are pleased with the job they are doing. &quot;We have had good relations with the U.N. for six months. So far everything is going well,&quot; said Iraq's Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh.</p>
<p>The observers, operating mainly in pairs, have in the three months since they were deployed conducted thousands of observations in silos and mills, spot checks of food and flour distributors and interviews with Iraqi beneficiaries.</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been an operation like this in U.N. history...Our observers are doing their job unhindered...We are strict and flexible...So far so good,&quot; Iraq's U.N. coordinator Steffan de Mistura told Reuters.</p>
<p>Iraq has completed partial oil exports under the deal worth $2 billion in six months to enable it buy urgent humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>U.N. officials in Baghdad said they hoped the plan would be renewed on the same lines when it comes under review by the security council next week.</p>
<p>But both the U.S. and Iraq have raised doubts for different reasons about continuing the plan on the same terms.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson last month voiced misgivings about the deal and senior Iraqi officials have declined questions on whether they would go for it again.</p>
<p>Iraq has frequently complained about the sluggish pace in the arrival of food and medical contracts.</p>
