<p>Israeli undercover forces snatched a wanted Islamic Jihad activist from a PLO-ruled West Bank enclave in a violation of peace agreements, Palestinian security sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said an Israeli force dressed as Arabs spirited Ghassan Mahdawi from a Tulkarm park late on Thursday. In protest, the Palestinian Authority halted joint patrols with Israel through the city.</p>
<p>The Israeli army was checking the report.</p>
<p>The Israeli action on PLO territory, at a time of high tension between the sides, drew sharp condemnation from a senior Palestinian military man.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a condemned assault and the act of an occupier,&quot; said the official who spoke to Reuters on condition he not be identified. &quot;It is a blatant violation of the (peace) agreement which is not acceptable at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel has handed over most of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank to PLO rule since signing a 1993 interim peace deal. It has rarely operated in those areas where Palestinian forces are in charge of security.</p>
<p>Mahdawi tunnelled his way out of an Israeli prison near Tel Aviv in August 1996 along with a second prisoner. He had been serving a 17-year sentence for stabbing a Jew.</p>
<p>Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas wage a violent struggle against Israeli peace deals with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). The groups have killed scores of Israelis in attacks.</p>
<p>PLO-Israel peace talks have been in deep crisis since Israel began building a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March. Tensions heightened on Thursday when Israel's Jerusalem municipality said it had approved another Jewish enclave in the Arab side of the city.</p>
<p>Palestinians demand a halt to settlement which they say pre-empts final status peace talks that have yet to begin in earnest. Israel refuses and for its part demands the Authority take stiffer action against militants.</p>
