<p>British bookmakers cut the odds on Friday of outsider Billy Bob Thornton winning the best actor Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony on Monday but Geoffrey Rush in &quot;Shine&quot; is still the clear favourite.</p>
<p>Ladrokes's are offering 5-1, slashed from 20-1, on Thornton for his role as a mentally disabled man in &quot;Sling Blade&quot; while Rush's portrayal of a tortured Australian pianist in &quot;Shine&quot; is 8-11 on.</p>
<p>&quot;Geoffrey Rush has been a favourite even before the Oscar nominations came out,&quot; Ladbrokes spokesman Simon Clare said.</p>
<p>In the best film category &quot;The English Patient&quot;, is the front-runner at 1-6 on while &quot;Shine&quot; at 11-2 and &quot;Fargo&quot; at 7-1 are a distant second and third.</p>
<p>&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; at 10-1 and &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; at 25-1 are the other films nominated for best picture. &quot;In terms of what we've been taking 'The English Patient' is a certainty,&quot; said Clare.</p>
<p>The big surprise has been in the best actress category where Frances McDormand's pregnant policewoman in &quot;Fargo&quot; at 4-9 on, is favoured over Kristin Scott Thomas (4-1) in &quot;The English Patient&quot; and Brenda Blethyn's Golden Globe award-winning performance in &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies.&quot; Blethyn is quoted at 3-1.</p>
<p>&quot;People just wanted to back her at any price. It's clearly become apparent that it's Frances McDormand,&quot; said Clare.</p>
