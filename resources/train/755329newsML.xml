<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Thursday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--The internal split within the left-wing opposition Socialist Peoples Party over the EU's Amsterdam Treaty has come out into the open again with leading advocates of a 'yes' campaigning for support in defiance of party leader Holger Nielsen, who is calling for rejection. Denmark is to hold a referendum in 1998 on the new EU reforms.</p>
<p>--Roskilde County has given the local airstrip, which is owned by nearby Copenhagen International Airport, permission to extend its runway and increase take-offs and landings tenfold to 25,000 annually, causing alarm among local residents.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--Tax rises and higher food prices caused Denmark's year-on-year inflation rate to rise in June 2.4 percent from April's 2.1 percent, calculated using the domestic method.</p>
<p>--SAS (Scandinavian Airlines)is expected by analysts to post a bumper first-half 1997 profit in the region of 700-991 million Swedish crowns in mid-August. Optimism about SAS is based on high expectations for its participation with other major airlines in Star Alliance and improved passenger volume.</p>
<p>--Three Danes were named in the Swiss Bank Association's 2,000 dormant accounts list of unclaimed funds owned by Jewish World War Two holocaust victims.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS-POSTEN</p>
<p>--Jyske Bank, Denmark's third biggest bank, is considering bringing legal action in Denmark against a former manager of its branch in Gibraltar and three accomplices. The London High Court found the Jyske Bank director guilty in absentia of fraud to the tune of 600 million crowns during the period 1988-92 on Wednesday. The bank reckons the former manager owes it close on 500 million crowns.</p>
