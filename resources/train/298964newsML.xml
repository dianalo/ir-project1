<p>Czech economic growth is progressing as expected, and despite stobbornly high inflation, no shock therapy to cut CPI is planned, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said in a newspaper interview on Friday.</p>
<p>In an interview with Czech business daily Hospodarske Noviny, Klaus painted an upbeat picture of the country's economic fundamentals saying that in so far as problems existed they were largely out of his hands.</p>
<p>Klaus ruled out a further tightening of the country's anti-inflationary policies, which, he said, would be too painful for the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of a radical reduction in inflation would be so high that I would in no circumstances recommend it...I would be content with a regular (yearly) one percent fall in the future,&quot; said Klaus.</p>
<p>Czech average annual CPI eased to 8.8 percent in 1996 from 9.1 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>Despite the downward trend in the rate of economic growth, which fell from a year-on-year real rate of 4.6 percent in the first quarter of 1996 to 3.6 percent in the third quarter, Klaus sharply rejected any suggestion that growth was too low.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather some of the more optimistic expectations were not fulfilled,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Klaus said that the tightness of the labour market -- December unemployment hit its highest in several years but was still only 3.5 percent -- was one of the biggest obstacles to higher growth. But he saw little room for the government to alter the situation.</p>
<p>Turning to the trade deficit, which ballooned to 140 billion crowns in the first 11 months of 1996 from an 81 billion crown shortfall for the same period in 1995, he said the key reason was the poor economic performance of western tarding partners.</p>
<p>Capping an interview which stressed caution and stability for the economy, Klaus said the privatisation of the country's largest banks was on the agenda but that there was no need to hurry.</p>
<p>Asked whether this meant that no dates for bank privatisation could be given, Klaus replied:&quot; Absolutely, I would above all like those interested in these banks to be aware of that.&quot;</p>
