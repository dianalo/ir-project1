<p>The United States rebuffed an appeal by Sierra Leone's ambassador on Thursday to use marines from a U.S. warship sent to evacuate Americans from the West African country to help overturn last Sunday's coup.</p>
<p>The helicopter carrier Kearsarge will evacuate about 250 American citizens on Friday from the capital Freetown to neighbouring Guinea because of the unstable situation in Sierra Leone, the Pentagon and State Department announced.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone envoy John Leigh told a rally in Washington that he was urging the U.S. administration &quot;to work with other nations and international organisations to act decisively to end the crisis, by force of arms if necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Leigh said he wanted the 1,200 Marines aboard the ship to support West African peace forces &quot;to bring in law and order&quot; and end a &quot;reign of terror&quot; by the leaders of the military coup, whom he described as &quot;wild savages&quot;.</p>
<p>But State Department spokesman John Dinger said: &quot;The role of the Kearsarge is to evacuate American citizens only. Personnel from the Kearsarge will have no role beyond that.&quot;</p>
<p>Army Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Kearsarge had arrived off Freetown early on Thursday and added: &quot;We anticipate beginning the (evacuation) operation tomorrow and completing it tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The situation (in Freetown) is not stable at all. There is a good deal of sporadic gunfire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bridges told reporters there were approximately 400 Americans in Sierra Leone, and that about 250 had indicated they wanted to leave the country.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Capt. Greg Ertel, commander of Amphibious Squadron Four, told reporters at the Pentagon via a telephone hookup from the Kearsarge 20 miles (32 kms) off Sierra Leone, that the evacuation would likely take place in daylight on Friday following a security check in Freetown.</p>
<p>He said big CH-53 &quot;Sea Stallion&quot; helicopters, which can carry up to 55 passengers, were likely to be used but that CH-46 &quot;Sea Knight&quot; helicopters, capable of carrying 22 passengers, would also be available.</p>
<p>The evacuation helicopters would be protected by Marine AH-1 &quot;Super Cobra&quot; attack helicopters, Ertel added.</p>
<p>Bridges told reporters earlier there was no indication that Americans were being targeted, but &quot;the randomness of the gunfire could put American citizens at risk.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Americans would be taken to the Kearsarge and then moved within a day or two to Conakry in Guinea, about 100 miles (160 kms) from Freetown, where they were expected to be flown back to the United States.</p>
<p>The State Department said 17 non-essential U.S. embassy personnel and dependents would be among those leaving, but 15 staff would stay on at the mission. All U.S. evacuees had been told to assemble at Freetown's Mammy Yoko Hotel.</p>
<p>Ambassador Leigh spoke earlier to about 50 banner-waving Sierra Leonean demonstrators across the street from the State Department. &quot;Fifty Marines from USS Kearsarge can boot the bandits out,&quot; one banner read.</p>
<p>Nigeria has sent troops to bolster a contingent of the ECOMOG peace-keeping force already in Sierra Leone, but no move to end the coup is expected until foreigners have been evacuated, according to West African military sources.</p>
<p>Leigh said he expected that even without U.S. help, West African forces would still move in and &quot;do the job,&quot; but it would be &quot;faster and less bloody&quot; with American support.</p>
<p>Washington has condemned the coup. Dinger said U.S. charge d'affaires in Freetown Ann Wright had contacted the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council set up by the coup leaders and reiterated demands that it surrender power immediately.</p>
<p>Dinger said Leigh was received after the demonstration by a State Department official and handed him a message for assistant secretary of state for African affairs George Moose.</p>
<p>Leigh said the Americans &quot;are very supportive, but American policy right now is to first of all secure the safety of American citizens in Freetown&quot;.</p>
