<title>BELGIUM: Belgian shares to bounce after Monday's thud.</title>
<headline>Belgian shares to bounce after Monday's thud.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-06-16</dateline>

<p>Belgian shares lost ground on Monday as investors were rattled by a European Union row over a single currency pact but should bounce back later in the week once U.S. inflation data is out of the way, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index slipped 12.96 points, or 0.54 percent, to 2,387.40 points as fears EU leaders, in Amsterdam for two days, could not cobble together a deal on EMU led to mild profit-taking following strong gains last week.</p>
<p>Dealers said, however, they remained optimistic. &quot;We can still go higher - today was just a small setback,&quot; Mignon, Hanart dealer Paul de Lophem said.</p>
<p>A weak start on Wall Street also hit Belgian shares, although a deal on EMU at the Amsterdam summit and a reversal of sentiment in New York in late European trade, lifted the Bel-20 from its lows.</p>
<p>One trader said he believed the index could soon resume its record-breaking run, placing the next target at 2,450 points.</p>
<p>Another traded said a late rise in financier Albert Frere's Belgian holding company Groupe Bruxelles Lambert could signal the long-awaited shake up in GBL units Royale Belge and BBL was just around the corner. GBL added 10 francs to 6,000 francs.</p>
<p>French insurance group AXA-UAP has been discussing the future of its Royale Belge unit for several months and speculation is rife it could be sold, along with its stake in bank BBL, to another financial group.</p>
<p>Royale Belge ended down 50 francs at 9,900 francs. BBL was off 90 francs at 9,810 francs.</p>
<p>Bank Kredietbank, one of the market's recent star performers on speculation of a link with Dutch Rabobank, was one of the biggest losers from the bout of profit taking, sliding 2.06 percent to 15,475 francs. Retailer Colruyt, one of the big gainers last week, lost 1.34 pct to 16,575 francs.</p>
<p>On the upside, bank Dexia whose publicly-owned controlling shareholder on Monday launched a secondary offering of around 15 percent of the bank at a maximum price of 3,825 francs a share, rose 75 francs to 3,900 francs. The shares being offered will not have rights to an 87 franc net dividend due to be paid at the end of June.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of that I expect the share to track this 3,825/3,900 range&quot; until the end of the offer on June 23, one trader said. The new Dexia shares are due to be listed from June 26.</p>
