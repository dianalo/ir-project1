<p>The number of Germans out of work last month crossed the psychologically important four million mark for the first time since German unification six years ago, raising fresh doubts about the economic recovery.</p>
<p>Official figures released on Thusday showd German unemployment rose to a seasonally adjusted 4.04 million in October, up an unexpectedly strong 41,000 from September.</p>
<p>In west Germany, 2.89 million people were out of work, up from 2.86 million, while east German jobless rolls rose 11,000 to 1.15 million.</p>
<p>The jobless rate, based on seasonally adjusted data from the Bundesbank, edged up to 10.6 percent in all of Germany from 10.4 percent in September. The rate rose slightly to 9.4 percent in west Germany and 15.5 percent in east Germany.</p>
<p>According to data not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, 3.87 million people were out of work in all of Germany last month, or 10.1 percent, up from 3.85 million the month before.</p>
<p>The jobless increase was stronger than independent economists had been expecting.</p>
<p>The Labour Office said the rise could be stopped, but dampened hopes that the high unemployment levels would begin to come down any time soon.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see a strengthening of the economy in 1997 -- and nobody sees a danger of a slump -- we could see the rise in unemployment come to a halt or possibly a moderate rise of the numbers in work,&quot; Hanspeter Leikeb, head of the labour office's research arm, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But this would probably just reflect a broadening of the labour market, he said, a statistical development that would not mean fewer people were out of work.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth is not yet strong enough and based on our estimates and estimates from the government we expect average pan German unemployment to be around 3.95 million in 1996 and 1997,&quot; said Klaus Leven, labour office vice president.</p>
<p>Labour Office officials said some job growth would come from the manufacturing sector and supplier and service industries. A decisive factor in overall economic growth would be domestic investment, which is still sluggish.</p>
<p>Construction, still hit by recession, would remain difficult in 1997 and there is no evidence of a turnaround.</p>
<p>Economists said the third strong rise in unemployment in as many months raised fresh doubts about the country's slow recovery and the government's chances of imposing budget cuts required to qualify for European monetary union.</p>
<p>The figures come just after Finance Minister Theo Waigel urged cutting the Labour budget by one billion marks ($663 million), and two days after a key business group argued the economy would recover more slowly than the government forecast.</p>
<p>&quot;What it says is that the present moderate economic upturn cannott create any new jobs. We have a too slow recovery, and higher demand is satisfied by overtime,&quot; said Christian Sobotta of LGT Asset Mangement in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Robert Prior-Wandesforde, a James Capel economist in London, said it was too soon to tell but the figures suggested the German economy was losing steam.</p>
<p>&quot;The likelihood of a sustained, strong bounce in activity is clearly becoming more remote,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ealier this week, the Federation of German Chambers of Commerce forecast economic growth of 1.5 to two percent in 1997, less than the government's 2.5 percent projection.</p>
<p>Sobotta said LGT expects 1.7 percent growth next year, but fairly favourable stock market conditions.</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) seized on the unemployment picture to renew their opposition to the deep cuts Kohl needs to meet European monetary union requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposed cuts are irresponsible and unrealistic,&quot; said SPD social affairs spokesman speaker Ottmar Schreiner. ($1=1.5087 Mark)</p>
