<title>UK: Daimler's H1 Airbus earnings 173 mln dmk.</title>

<p>German industrial conglomerate Daimler-Benz AG said on Thursday that earnings from its stake in the Airbus Industrie commercial airliner consortium totalled 173 million marks in the first half of this year, up from 132 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>A Daimler spokesman said the earnings represented its full share of the Airbus consortium's profits but said the figure can fluctuate strongly, citing order flows, and be misleading.</p>
<p>Airbus does not publish earnings figures but Daimler, under its U.S. accounting rules, is obliged to state its share of business.</p>
<p>The company said in its interim results statement released in London that Airbus Industrie's turnover was up 44 percent in the first half. The spokesman said Daimler had no further details. In 1996, the plane consortium made a net profit of 707 million marks on sales of 13.35 billion.</p>
<p>Daimler's aerospace subsidiary DASA holds a 38 percent stake in the Airbus consortium.</p>
<p>Schrempp said he was confident that Airbus would eventually become a single entity company, which he said was necessary to fend off tough U.S. competition.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to get our act together in Europe. We need to transform Airbus into a single entity company,&quot; he said, adding that Airbus believed it could eventually achieve global market share of 50 percent.</p>
<p>Schrempp said DASA and British Aerospace Plc were pressing for Airbus to become a single entity. The consortium also includes France's state-owned Aerospatiale and Spain's CASA.</p>
<p>&quot;Behind the scenes, things are looking better and the timing is still set for this century,&quot; Schrempp told the news conference.</p>
<p>Schrempp said he was confident that the French government would eventually privatise defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and that consolidation in the European defence and aerospace industry would continue. DASA and France's Lagardere have bid for a majority stake in Thomson.</p>
<p>&quot;Without those steps, we have no chance whatsoever against the Americans...All my discussions with French officials say they want to move in this direction,&quot; Schrempp said.</p>
