<p>Northern Ireland Catholics, fearful of fresh Protestant attacks, fled a battered apartment building on Monday after a second night of street disturbances.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm scared, I'm scared of my life,&quot; said Sylvia Kerr as her husband and friends stuffed possessions into black plastic bags and packed them into a waiting truck.</p>
<p>&quot;We're moving out, we couldn't stick it,&quot; she said after a weekend of rioting.</p>
<p>Housing officials said 17 households had been hit by the disturbances, in which apartments and houses were damaged in scenes reminiscent of enforced evacuations in the north of Belfast last summer.</p>
<p>Community workers were planning to hold meetings later on Monday to try to calm people and to defuse any intimidation that could spark community tensions.</p>
<p>Local people said eight families had fled the private apartment block after Protestant &quot;Loyalist&quot; hoodlums broke in, but added that others living in houses that had been damaged were determined to stay.</p>
<p>The flareup on Saturday underlined the volatility of a province hit by guerrilla warfare, political deadlock and church burnings.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the worst I have ever seen it, so there's no way we would stay,&quot; said a young Catholic man as friends carrying boxes and bags picked their way through rooms full of glass fragments.</p>
<p>&quot;They just came in from the back and the front. Me and my girlfriend were trapped. One of the residents had a mild heart attack,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They came in with sledge-hammers. These weren't children, they were grown men. It was orchestrated. It is a campaign to get us out of here. The attackers threatened to return with petrol bombs.</p>
<p>&quot;We were holding the back door when they were trying to come in with cudgels. They threatened they would be back...some night when the security force presence dies down.&quot;</p>
<p>Sylvia Kerr said the thugs did not get into her apartment but broke her windows before smashing doors and furniture in three other apartments.</p>
<p>&quot;We tried our best, our real best, to keep the door closed. We could have been killed, anything could have happened,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Police said that on Saturday night rival crowds clashed and officers were stoned when they tried to separate them. Officers eventually drove the Protestants back into their zone.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, 24 hours after the apartments were attacked, Protestants lit a fire on the road.</p>
<p>&quot;After police moved into extinguish the fire and quell the trouble, five petrol bombs were thrown towards them,&quot; a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Politicians say the province will not be at peace until banned Irish Republican Army guerrillas, whose powerbase is in Catholic areas, call off a quarter century-long war against British rule.</p>
<p>The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, is banned from peace talks until the group agrees to a ceasefire.</p>
