<p>Russia will sell 25 pct of AO Svyazinvest state telecoms holding company at a cash auction in mid-May, State Property Committee chairman Alfred Kokh said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kokh had said earlier this month that the stake would be auctioned some time this year at a starting price of $1.1 billion. He said on Thursday that there would be no restrictions on which companies could bid for the stake.</p>
<p>Kokh told a conference that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday signed a draft decree on Svyazinvest sales and President Boris Yeltsin would receive it on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The draft provides for sales of 25 percent of shares in AO Svyazinvest in a single lot at a cash auction in the amount of 25 percent plus one share without restrictions on residents and non-residents participation,&quot; Kokh said.</p>
<p>He said the revenue from the sales would be between $1.5 and $2.0 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;If we sell the lot successfully, we shall overfulfill the budget target (for privatisation revenues) twofold,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the starting price of the stake could be changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we suppose the starting price to be $1.1 billion,&quot; he said. &quot;To participate one is to make a $400 million pre-payment. But this is now, it can be changed later.&quot;</p>
<p>Svyazinvest is one of the government's privatisation targets this year.</p>
<p>The company has controlling stakes in 85 regional telecommunications companies.</p>
