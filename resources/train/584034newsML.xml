<p>Dutch overnight money eased a touch in quiet Wednesday afternoon trade, changing hands at 3.12 percent versus 3.25 percent earlier, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said trade was concentrated at the very short end, adding call money rates were still relatively high due to an unusually short secured loans pact.</p>
<p>The current pact has been set at 35 days rather than the customary three months, and is due to expire on May 23.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing disturbing the market at the moment is that secured loans pact,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said uncertainty over the exact impact of the short pact had led market players to step up their savings under the scheme.</p>
<p>The pact's short duration is linked to the introduction of new money market instruments in mid-1997 ahead of European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>Dealers said they had not noticed any business in Dutch Treasury Certificates, where rates were set at an unchanged 3.14 percent for the June and the July programmes and at 3.20 percent for the December programme.</p>
<p>The Dutch government's announcement that its remaining borrowing requirement for the year stood at 10 billion guilders did not have any impact on the money market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The guilder firmed slightly against the mark, trading at 112.45 per 100 marks versus Tuesday's 112.48.</p>
