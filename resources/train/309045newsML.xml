<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday asked IES Industries, WPL Holdings Inc, and Interstate Power Co to negotiate an agreement to protect their ratepayers from sharp price increases in order to win approval of their merger plan.</p>
<p>Applying its new merger policy guidelines, the commission focused on the impact of the proposed merger on rates, competition, and regulation.</p>
<p>The companies first filed their merger application 10 months ago.  </p>
<p>However, the filing was revised several times, most recently in September.</p>
<p>Under the new merger policy, designed to speed up the approval process, the commission said it hoped to be able to rule on all cases within 12 to 15 months of receiving a final application.</p>
<p>Some of the utilities' customers complained that the companies had offered to freeze rates after the merger rather than reduce them as they saved money.</p>
<p>The commission gave the companies, including IES Utilities, Interstate Power Co, Wisconsin Power and Light Co and South Beloit Water, 30 days to reach an agreement with the customers that complained.</p>
<p>If they reached no agreement, the commission said it would decide the issue or call for an administrative law judge to hear the case.</p>
<p>The commission also raised concern about a potential transmission constraint in one part of the Wisconsin Upper Michigan System area and called for a judge to decide by June 30 what impact it would have on competition in the subregion.</p>
