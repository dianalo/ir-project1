<headline>Paxson to acquire ITT/Dow Jones TV station, launch network.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>Paxson Communications Corp. said Monday it agreed to acquire WBIS Channel 31 in New York City from a partnership of Dow Jones Inc. and ITT Corp. in a deal valued at $257.5 million.</p>
<p>Paxson said the channel, its 50th, will become the flagship station of the West Palm Beach, Fla.-based company's proposed new nationwide broadcast TV network.</p>
<p>The company said it is the largest U.S. TV station broadcaster, owning, operating or with affiliates covering more than 57 percent of all U.S. TV households.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the launch of the new network later this year, the station -- to be renamed WPXN TV-31 -- will sell air time to ethnic, foreign language, religious, cable and speciality programmers as well as infomercial entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Paxson, which also owns 43 radio stations and 507 billboards throughout Florida, said it will operate the station under a time brokerage agreement from June 30 until the deal closes in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Dow Jones is expected to terminate its business news as of June 29.</p>
<p>But Paxson Chief Executive Lowell Paxson told reporters the station would continue to carry the 21 hours a week of sporting events and news provided by Liberty/Fox Sports -- a venture of News Corp. Ltd. and Liberty Media Corp.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the sellers said they made a gain on their investment in the station, which they bought from the City of New York in 1996 for $207 million.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to regulatory approval, which is expected later this year. It is not subject to financing conditions, the companies said.</p>
<p>Paxson's stock fell 37.5 cents to $10 on the American Stock Exchange at midday.</p>
