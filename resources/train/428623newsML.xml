<p>Beijing police were on high alert on Saturday after a homemade bomb exploded on a rush-hour bus in one of the Chinese capital's busiest commercial districts, local sources and state media said.</p>
<p>The sources said at least two people were killed by the blast, which ripped through a Number 22 bus as it trundled through western Beijing's Xidan district at around 7.00 pm (1100 GMT) on Friday.</p>
<p>State-run Beijing Television quoted police as saying a homemade explosive device had caused the blast, but that it had caused no deaths.</p>
<p>&quot;On-the-spot study showed the explosive was planted beside the left-hand seats three and four rows from the front of the bus,&quot; the station said, adding that a large reward had been offered for information that could help catch the bombers.</p>
<p>It said police were appealing to the public and particularly to passengers who had ridden on the bus in the period up to the time of the blast to come forward with any leads.</p>
<p>The bombing, which followed similar attacks recently in the far-western Xinjiang region but was the first reported in Beijing for many years, prompted authorities to put police on to high alert, Chinese sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is very tense,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Other sources said a bomb warning had been telephoned to Beijing police before the explosion, but added that the caller had named another area in the capital.</p>
<p>Police officials gave no hint of who might have planted the bomb, but some city residents were quick to suggest it could be the work of Moslem separatists from restive Xinjiang.</p>
<p>A spate of bus bombings in Xinjiang last month by militant members of the region's dominant Uighur nationality killed nine people and wounded 74.</p>
<p>Three bombs blew up within minutes of each other on February 25 in the regional capital Urumqi in attacks apparently timed to coincide with memorial rites in Beijing for China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Beijing taxi drivers said their employers had warned them last week not to give rides to any suspicious-looking people from Xinjiang and to be especially cautious in areas where Uighur migrants were numerous.</p>
<p>&quot;They said that if we give a Xinjiang person a ride we should check the cab for bombs after he gets out,&quot; said one taxi driver, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>One witness to Friday's explosion said that he had seen windows blown out of the back of the articulated bus and that around nine people had appeared to be seriously hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;The bomb blast was not very loud, but it blew out the back window and everybody ran,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a great flame and a &quot;boom' sound and then people jumped out of the bus,&quot; said a young man who had been working nearby.</p>
<p>Police officials said none of the more than 10 passengers injured in the blast had sustained life-threatening injuries.</p>
<p>On Saturday all appeared normal in Xidan district, where shoppers flocked into department stores and crowded into restaurants along the main thoroughfare, swept clean of the glass shards that had littered it after the blast.</p>
<p>Local shopkeepers tending their counters just metres (yards) from the scene of the explosion appeared unconcerned.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't foreign countries also have this kind of incident, with bombs far more serious than this one?&quot; said a shoe shop worker.</p>
