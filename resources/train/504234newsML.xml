<p>China's ruling Communist Party on Friday issued its most detailed regulations in nearly a decade to tighten discipline, hinting at subversion within its own ranks as well as corruption and womanising.</p>
<p>&quot;The current struggle against corruption is very severe,&quot; the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the 57 million-member party, said in a front-page editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;The task of correcting the party style is arduous, some forms of corruption are continuously reappearing, and some are even becoming more rampant,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Discipline Inspection Commission issued the first new rules to combat corruption in nine years to combat rising graft in a party that swept to power on a platform of probity in 1949 after toppling the corruption-riddled Nationalist party.</p>
<p>&quot;These rules are a powerful weapon in the struggle against corruption and to safeguard party discipline,&quot; the People's Daily said.</p>
<p>Corruption, virtually unknown in China under the communist rule of late party chairman Mao Zedong, has made a rapid comeback in nearly two decades of market reform.</p>
<p>The late Deng Xiaoping's open-door policy has opened up loopholes for authorities to exploit their positions for personal gain, while providing opportunities for officials to see pornography and to visit prostitutes -- both eradicated in the early years of communist rule.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party Discipline Punishment Rules, outlining what party members should not do and the penalties they face for offences, filled two pages of major state newspapers.</p>
<p>Top of the list were details of political errors that would merit punishments ranging from a warning, to disqualification for promotion and expulsion.</p>
<p>Party members must not organise or join groups, meetings or demonstrations opposed to the party line, the rules said.</p>
<p>Publication of writings or statements that oppose China's basic principles -- such as the dictatorship of the proletariat the leadership of the Communist Party -- is prohibited.</p>
<p>The rules specifically ban the setting up of secret groups within the party and attempts to split the party, as well as attempts to flee China and seek political asylum overseas. Party members must also not reveal state secrets to foreigners or join foreign intelligence organisations.</p>
<p>China's ruling party sacked its former head Zhao Ziyang in June 1989 for his alleged support for student-led pro-democracy demonstrations of May and June of that year and trying to split the party.</p>
<p>His top aide, Poliburo secretary Bao Tong, was jailed for six years on charges of revealing state secrets to students.</p>
<p>On corruption, the rules specify that party members must not hold state assets for more than six months and ban the borrowing of public funds for more than six months.</p>
<p>The rules stipulate a ban on colluding with traders to trade stocks directly or indirectly based on inside information.</p>
<p>The regulations also tackle a rapidly spreading vice within party ranks -- womanising. They ban party members from visiting prostitutes, from acting as pimps, from receiving a massage from a member of the opposite sex and from seeing pornographic movies and publications.</p>
