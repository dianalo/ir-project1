<p>Slovakia on Wednesday rejected Hungarian accusations that it was violating a bilateral treaty by failing to pass a long-awaited minority language law.</p>
<p>&quot;The Slovak Republic is not violating any international legal commitments,&quot; Slovak Foreign Ministry spokesman Ivan Korcok said in an official statement.</p>
<p>On Monday Hungarian Foreign Minister Laszlo Kovacs appealed to Slovakia to pass the law, saying Bratislava was contravening its international commitments to its large ethnic Hungarian minority by delaying the legislation.</p>
<p>The law is a requirement of a &quot;basic treaty&quot; ratified by Hungary and Slovakia last year which guarantees current borders, human rights and the protection of minorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Misleading statements such as this, which place Slovakia in a negative position before the international public, are unfounded and counter-productive,&quot; Korcok added.</p>
<p>In 1995 the Slovak parliament passed a controversial language law making Slovak the only official language, overriding protests from the country's 500,000 ethnic Hungarians and provoking international condemnation.</p>
<p>The law was passed with the partial support of opposition parties and signed by President Michal Kovac on the assumption that the government of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar would also introduce a law on the protection of minority languages in areas with larger ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The government however has so far failed to draft such a law, with Meciar and other ministers arguing that minority languages were sufficiently protected by the constitution and national laws.</p>
<p>Failure by the government to place a minority language protection law before parliament has provoked strong criticism from Kovac, involved in a political vendetta with Meciar, as well as the Council of Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Relations between Slovakia and neighbouring Hungary, once communist bloc allies, are strained over what Budapest alleges is Bratislava's ill-treatment of its Hungarian minority.</p>
