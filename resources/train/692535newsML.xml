<p>CBOT soybeans ended mixed Friday, with new crop contracts supported by expectations for a drop in soybean acreage, while July was hammered by long liquidation, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;November beans were holding up because of the possibility of a low acreage number in Monday's report,&quot; said Dan Cekander, grain analyst for FIMAT Futures Inc.</p>
<p>On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its latest acreage forecast, and most analysts see a drop in acreage from the government's previous estimate of 68.8 million acres. The average trade estimate was 68.4 million acres, from a range of 67.3 to 69.5 million acres.</p>
<p>In late trading, ADM and Tenco were heavy sellers in July, and traders continued to exit that contract before first notice day on Monday.</p>
<p>Expectations for deliveries against July have also kept that contract on the defensive. As of Friday at 1330 CDT, there were only 10,000 bushels of soybeans registered for delivery, but some traders expect as much as one million bushels.</p>
<p>July soybeans futures settled 13-1/4 per bushel lower at $7.87, with other months ended steady to 4-1/2 higher.  </p>
<p>USDA will also issue quarterly grain stocks figures on Monday. All analysts see a drop in soybean stocks from last year's June 1 figure of 623 million bushels.</p>
<p>The average trade estimate is 516 million bushels. That figure comes from a range of 499 to 537 million bushels.</p>
<p>U.S. Midwest weather remained favorable for crop development and was seen trimming advances in new crop months, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather is still bearish,&quot; said one trader. &quot;The crop keeps getting bigger and it's so far, so good.&quot;</p>
<p>On the day, ING and Refco each sold one million bushels November, and Rosenthal Collins bought one million July and sold one million November.</p>
<p>In options trade, Lind-Waldock bought 1,000 August $7.50 calls and sold 1,000 August $8.00 calls. They also bought 500 November $7.00 calls and sold 500 November $6.25 puts, pit traders said.</p>
<p>Volatility was put at 23 percent in November, 23-1/2 percent in September and 28-1/2 in August.</p>
<p>Friday's volume was estimated as 67,000 contracts. That figure compared with Thursday's actual volume of 70,240.</p>
