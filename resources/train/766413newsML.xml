<headline>Fujitsu agrees to buy rest of Amdahl for $850 million.</headline>

<p>Japanese computer conglomerate Fujitsu Ltd on Wednesday said it will buy the remainder of the shares of Amdahl Corp that it does not own for $12 a share, in a cash deal worth about $850 million.</p>
<p>Fujitsu already owned 42 percent of Amdahl, helping it build its business of selling mainframe computers and data storage devices that are compatible with International Business Machines Corp.'s systems.</p>
<p>The deal consumates a partnership between the two companies dating back more than two decades. But its timing startled some analysts, and several voiced disappointment over the price.</p>
<p>Amdahl shares, which had jumped 16 percent Monday to close at $11.8126, gained 6.25 cents to $11.875 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Amdahl, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was founded in 1970 by Gene Amdahl, the principal architect of IBM's popular family of business mainframe computers known as the System 360.</p>
<p>&quot;Gene Amdahl is really one of the industry lords. He will continue to be as such,&quot; said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix, Ariz. &quot;As the father of the IBM System 360, he practically invented the computer industry.&quot;</p>
<p>By creating a computer system that could be upgraded with new compatible machines and parts, Amdahl effectively created the model for the modern computing era, where personal computer hardware and software can be routinely upgraded.</p>
<p>Amdahl was the first to offer an alternative mainframe computer and achieved success by offering machines that were faster, cheaper and with higher capacity than IBM mainframes.</p>
<p>Amdahl has been transforming itself into a computer integration and services company.</p>
<p>&quot;They've made themselves into a different company,&quot; said John Jones, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>With 1996 sales of $36 billion, Fujitsu is the world's third-largest computer company after IBM and Hewlett-Packard Co.. Fujitsu was one of Amdahl's earliest investors, steadily increasing its stake over the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Amdahl's financial results began to deteriorate in the early 1990s amid a general slowing of demand for mainframe computers. But earnings have stabilised in recent years as Amdahl diversified into system integration businesses and participated in a cut-throat pricing war that spurred new demand for mainframes.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, Amdahl has acquired two new support and services businesses -- DMR and Trecom. Its sales of computer hardware have diminished to around a third of revenue from 80 percent five years ago, Djurdjevic said.</p>
<p>In a conference call with the company, some analysts were critical of the lack of premium in the buyout price, but several said there is unlikely to be any rival offer.</p>
<p>&quot;Until such time as anybody outbids Fujitsu, that's the best deal they've got, and I haven't heard of anybody clamouring to take over Amdahl,&quot; said Djurdjevic.</p>
<p>Some analysts cited talk the company was facing another restructuring and chose to sell out to preserve its business.</p>
<p>Jack Lewis, Amdahl's chairman and chief executive, said &quot;timing is something caused by events that sometimes we have no control over,&quot; but declined to provide further details.</p>
<p>Fujitsu said Amdahl will become a wholly-owned subsidiary, retaining its company name and management team, with essentially no reductions in employment.</p>
<p>&quot;They were nine months behind IBM in the mainframe space. They've been in a recovery status on the storage business, both of which are being negatively influenced by the lack of technology from Fujitsu,&quot; said Salomon Brothers' Jones.</p>
