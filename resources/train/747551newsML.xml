<p>Singapore blue chips stocks won some favour on Tuesday with investors looking to accumulate bargains while Malaysian over-the-counter (OTC) issues were sold off.</p>
<p>Dealers said local and foreign funds were selectively buying core stocks, due to a brighter second half economic outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;They think it's fair value now. Foreign funds are lining up orders for blue chips,&quot; said one foreign brokerage dealer.</p>
<p>She said Singapore stocks were seen a better bet than other markets due to its weaker but more stable currency.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed down 0.24 points at 1,950.51 on active volume of 179 million shares.</p>
<p>The UOB OTC index, which tracks Malaysian stocks, slipped 4.71 points to 1,083.92, partly on currency fears.</p>
<p>News that Malaysia' reserves fell to 61.9 billion ringgit at July 15 against 70.7 billion a fortnight ago, hurt sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;It confirmed what everybody knows but it contributes to the bearish mentality,&quot; another broker said,</p>
<p>In the broader market, gainers trailed losers, 172 to 185.</p>
<p>The index was hit by falls in Cerebos Pacific, down Singapore 25 cents to a fresh low of S$5.55.</p>
<p>Keppel Corp also dampened the STII, easing 15 cents to S$6.65. The actives were led by small capitalisation stocks such as Asia Food &amp; Properties, which rebounded from a new low of US$1.00 to close up one cent at US$1.09.</p>
<p>Retailer Heshe saw 10 million shares crossed at 33 cents. The issue rose one cent to S$0.33.</p>
<p>Dealers said early married trades on Flextech, with 20,000 shares executed at S$0.83, were done outside the market and was a &quot;keying in mistake&quot;. It closed two cents lower at S$1.75.</p>
