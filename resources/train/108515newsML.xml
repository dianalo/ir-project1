<p>The president of Sierra Leone, whose country is still under the shadow of civil war, on Thursday appealed to the U.N. General Assembly not to abandon Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at current economic, social and political conditions in our continent, including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin, one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development,&quot; President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, the thrust of my message today is simple. My appeal to the international community is not to abandon Africa. Even though we may be on our knees in anguish, I firmly believe there is hope for Africa,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The continent and its people had the ability to overcome natural and self-inflicted constraints and achieve political stability as well as reasonable economic prosperity, he added.</p>
<p>Referring to democratic elections held in Sierra Leone in March, despite civil strife which has taken thousands of lives, he said his presence at the United Nations was symbolic of hope.</p>
<p>The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which launched a civil war in 1991, had &quot;no political agenda and no respect for democracy&quot; and failed to disrupt the election, he said.</p>
<p>Although it had indicated it was ready to sign a peace agreement drafted by the Ivory Coast as mediator, it now seemed unwilling to follow through, raising fears of a full-scale resumption of hostilities.</p>
<p>&quot;It is therefore time for the international community to act to forestall this potential catastrophe by demanding that the RUF sign the peace agreement without further delay, failing which the imposition of sanctions against them should be considered,&quot; Tejan Kabbah said.</p>
