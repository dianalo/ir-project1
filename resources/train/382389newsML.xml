<title>FRANCE: French stocks close higher after weak day.</title>
<headline>French stocks close higher after weak day.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>French shares closed higher after having spent most of the day in the red as a stronger dollar in the afternoon provided support in the absence of any Wall Street influence, dealers said.</p>
<p>Wall Street is closed today.</p>
<p>The dollar broke a 34-month record above 1.70 marks.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 7.06 points or 0.27 percent at 2,634.48 while the CAC-40 futures contract was up at 2,642 from 2,631 on Friday's close.</p>
<p>Total volume was 6.32 billion francs and 4.3 billion in CAC-40 shares.  </p>
<p>* Renault is biggest loser among blue-chips, falling 2.94 percent to 118.90 as analysts slash their results forecasts after a company profit warning on Friday.</p>
<p>* Peugeot down 2.05 percent at 572.</p>
<p>* GAN fell 4.53 percent to 118 francs, after six percent on Friday, on a repeated profit warning and worries about a needed capital injection.</p>
<p>* Alcatel Alsthom gained 2.39 percent to 601 francs, below a fresh year high of 608 francs, partly in reaction to this weekend's global telecommunications pact.  </p>
<p>* BNP gained 3.33 percent to 244.90 francs, surpassing its 1993 flotation price of 240 francs for the first time since July 1995.</p>
<p>It has clawed its way back from a low of 171.50 last August. Since the start of the year it has gained more than 22 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The climb observed over the last few weeks is just basically catchup,&quot; said one analyst. Another analyst said BNP &quot;was most behind the others in gaining ground.&quot;</p>
<p>* Accor, up four percent at 780, was boosted by technical factors, dealers said.</p>
