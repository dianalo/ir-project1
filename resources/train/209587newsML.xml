<p>A powerful blast ripped through a building in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia on Friday, the eve of a parliamentary poll organised by separatists in defiance of the U.N. and of the Georgian government.</p>
<p>Abkhaz &quot;interior minister&quot; Alik Kchach said a bomb blew apart a government building in the town of Gali, 75 km southeast of the regional capital Sukhumi. He said nobody was injured in the explosion, which went off at 1030 (0730 GMT).</p>
<p>Kchach blamed ethnic Georgian &quot;sabotage units&quot; for the blast and said more violence could be expected. A similar explosion on Thursday damaged a building due to house a polling station.</p>
<p>Later on Friday Abkhaz Press, the state information agency, said a Russian peacekeeper was badly injured when his armoured personnel carrier hit a mine also in the Gali region, populated largely by ethnic Georgians opposed to the poll.</p>
<p>The report could not be immediately confirmed.</p>
<p>The Georgian government says Saturday's parliamentary vote called by the independence-minded Abkhaz government of Vladislav Ardzinba is illegal but has denied any links with the alleged &quot;sabotage units&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;These explosions won't deter us. We are going ahead with the elections no matter what. We have taken adequate measures. We will not be intimidated,&quot; Kchach told Reuters.</p>
<p>Abkhazia, a Black Sea coastal region once favoured by the Soviet communist elite, has run itself as an independent state since 1993 when its fighters, backed by Russia, routed Georgian government troops after a year-long war which cost 10,000 lives.</p>
<p>At least 150,000 ethnic Georgian refugees have still not returned to Abkhazia after they fled the conflict, fearing ethnic cleansing.</p>
<p>Georgia wants them to be allowed to return home and for political issues to be resolved before any elections.</p>
<p>On Friday the head of the pro-Georgian parliament of Abkhazia, Tamaz Nadariyesgvili, said in a radio interview that Saturday's election results would be meaningless.</p>
<p>&quot;We can definitely expect the results to be falsified because there are not enough people living in Abkhazia to make them valid,&quot; he said, referring to the big 1993 exodus.</p>
<p>The refugees will take part in a parallel plebiscite organised by Tbilisi on Saturday in which they will get a chance to condemn the vote, going on without them, as illegitimate.</p>
<p>Both the United Nations and Eduard Shevardnadze's Georgian government, which firmly opposes Abkhaz independence, have called for cancellation of the Abkhaz election, in which 81 candidates are vying for 35 parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>The Abkhaz are in firm control of most of their small, picturesque region except for the Gali area, where violence has become common despite the presence of 2,500 Russian peacekeepers and a contingent of U.N. military observers.</p>
<p>Abkhaz troops in Gali told Reuters on Thursday they were on alert and preparing for a possible large-scale Georgian attack to try to disrupt voting.</p>
<p>Kchach said 80 Georgian commandos had infiltrated Abkhazia in recent days and were planning terrorist acts.</p>
<p>&quot;These are mostly refugees who used to live in Abkhazia. Shevardnadze dosen't have any control over them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russian officers still stationed in Abkhazia say openly that they were ordered to help the Abkhaz during the war with training, vast amounts of weapons and ammunition at a time when Georgia's relations with Moscow were bad.</p>
<p>But with Georgia now a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, successor to the Soviet Union, and Russia facing separatist problems of its own, Moscow has told Abkhazia to forget independence and work out an arrangement with Tbilisi.</p>
<p>The head of the UN observer mission in Abkhazia, Major General Per Kallstrom, told Reuters recently that he feared the elections could trigger a new cycle of violence that could reignite full-scale war between Georgia and Abkhazia.</p>
