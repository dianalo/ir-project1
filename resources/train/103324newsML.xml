<p>Britain unveiled one of the last pieces in the controversial privatisation of its railway system on Tuesday with a complex plan to attract new tilting trains on to the busiest inter city passenger route in the country.</p>
<p>The 1.5 billion pound ($2.34 billion) plan is the brainchild of OPRAF, the agency seeking to find private franchise operators for all the country's 25 passenger train lines ahead of a general election due by next spring.</p>
<p>OPRAF director Roger Salmon, due to step down this month, said he was confident that his agency's search for a suitable operator for Inter City West Coast (ICWC) could now succeed.</p>
<p>He anticipated the contract for ICWC, which operates trains running from London to the Midlands, northwest England and Scotland via Glasgow, would be completed by next March.</p>
<p>OPRAF's optimism stems from a pact it has struck with Railtrack Plc, the already-privatised owner and operator of the bulk of Britain's railway network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Railtrack is to spend 1.35 billion pounds over the next six years improving track, signals, power supply, stations and other equipment along the line, which is the prime artery for passengers and freight on the western side of Great Britain.</p>
<p>This is a much-needed upgrade that Railtrack acknowleges must be done as the line is near the end of its economic life. Without it, there would be little incentive for a private firm to run the line while its trains remain slow and uncompetitive.</p>
<p>The renewal will not, in itself, allow a private franchisee to run the ICWC passenger services faster, however, so OPRAF has sealed another, optional deal with Railtrack to do more work to provide for tilting trains, at a cost of 150 million pounds.</p>
<p>OPRAF said replacing the entire ICWC rolling stock fleet could cost 500 million pounds for a full set of 35 to 36 trains, which could then travel at up to 200 kilometres an hour (120 mph) compared to the current maximum of 175 km/h (105 mph).</p>
<p>To make sure that the economics of using faster trains is properly addressed by bidders, OPRAF is requiring all interested parties to submit both an &quot;unimproved&quot; and a &quot;tilting&quot; offer.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a firm deal with Railtrack, so franchisees will know what it will cost them in extra charges,&quot; Salmon said, adding he was quite sure that tilting trains would be cheaper.</p>
<p>&quot;If, and I think there's a high prospect of this, bids for tilting trains are cheaper than for conventional, we would simply accept the best bid for the upgrade,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>Salmon made clear that it was his firm desire to see the tilting technology brought onto the line, in order to achieve what he called a &quot;step change in journey times and quality&quot;.</p>
<p>However, he noted that if private firms could only see the faster service costing more than the existing trains, then the government would have to be asked to consider footing the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;In the event that there will be a premium price required, then we will have to consult with the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Salmon saw a service of tilting trains on the ICWC offering passengers a cut in the journey time from London to Manchester to two hours from 2-1/2 hours, and bringing London-Glasgow down to four hours 20 minutes from the current five hours or more. ($1=.6401 Pound)</p>
