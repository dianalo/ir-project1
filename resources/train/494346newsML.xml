<p>Bund futures were little changed by late in the day on Tuesday with traders saying the market had entered into a consolidation period that should limit prices moves in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Analysts said Bunds, which rallied strongly on Monday, needed to digest what has been a period of heavy volatility and that a lack of any market moving news until Friday should leave the DTB Bund futures contract between 99.85 and 100.50.</p>
<p>At 1433 GMT, the DTB June Bund futures contract was up two basis points at 100.26 after having traded in a range between 100.07 and 100.48.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market has been through a difficult time of late and needs to consolidate,&quot; said Ian Ford, analyst at MCM YieldWatch in London. &quot;We should see a bit of range trading.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunds posted little reaction to the Federal Labour Office's announcement that March unemployment fell a seasonally adjusted 15,000 to 4.3 million.</p>
<p>Traders said the reduction, due to warm weather that gave a boost to building, had been expected after several leaks of the data to the media and that they expect joblessness to remain a problem here in the months ahead.  </p>
<p>News that the opposition Social Democrats and Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet next week to restart talks on overhauling Germany's tax system likewise had little impact on Bunds.</p>
<p>Analysts added that a lack of scheduled news until Friday's U.S. retail sales and producer price data should further limit the market's moves.</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year cash Bund was slightly weaker late in the day at 100.70 to yield 5.89 percent, down from 100.76 on Monday.</p>
<p>Despite a sluggish market, Bunds managed to outperform Treasuries, pushing the spread to 112 basis points from 110.  </p>
<p>Analysts said bond markets from around Europe have been able to outperform the Treasury market because of the growing perception that the U.S. economy is ahead of Europe in the business cycle and inflation dangers there are greater.</p>
<p>Bunds, however, may have limited ability to continue climbing against Treasuries with the spread already back to high levels after dipping to below 100 earlier last month.</p>
