<headline>U.S. mortgage-backeds gain, spreads widen slightly.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-03</dateline>

<p>U.S. mortgage-backeds gained as much as 1/2 point Thursday, but most spreads widened as the mortgage market underperformed U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;People should have very neutral positions in mortgage holdings,&quot; said Cynthia Rivera, an associate director at BZW Securities Inc. Investors should avoid 8-9 1/2 percent coupons, where the risk outweighs rewards, she said.</p>
<p>Strong prepayments could be triggered in those coupons once 30-year Treasuries yield 6.50 percent. The yield fell 10 basis points to 6.62 percent Thursday on June's 5.0 percent unemployment and 0.3 percent average hourly earnings rise.  </p>
<p>Treasury bond yields have to fall just 12 basis points for premium mortgage-backeds to &quot;enter the danger zone&quot; of prepayments, Rivera said. Mortgages would then lag Treasuries more sharply. Spreads would widen by as much as five basis points a day, compared with one to two basis points Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The safest bet is in slight discounts or discount coupons&quot; if the market advance persists, Rivera advised.</p>
<p>In key issues, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5 percent coupons were up 16/32 at 101-08/32 bid, yielding 98 basis points over 10-year Treasuries. Comparable Fannie Maes were up 14/32 at 101-04/32 and Freddie Macs were up 13/32 at 101-08/32.</p>
