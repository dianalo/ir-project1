<headline>Malaysia, South Africa sign trade pacts.</headline>

<p>South Africa and Malaysia signed agreements on Friday aimed at stepping up bilateral trade as regional groupings in Africa and southeast Asia begin to forge links across the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela, making his first visit to Malaysia since becoming president in 1994, witnessed the agreements with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
<p>The agreements extend Most Favoured Nation status to both countries and provide for enhanced maritime and shipping links.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of such small but concrete steps we are building extensive relations of trade, investment, cooperation and common action...,&quot; Mandela said in a speech later in the day.</p>
<p>Malaysia is the last stop on Mandela's four-nation Southeast Asian tour that also included the Philippines, Brunei and Singapore. He is being accompanied by a delegation of 115 ministers, officials and businessmen.</p>
<p>Mandela said he wanted to closely observe the workings of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and apply the lessons to the fledgling Southern Africa Development Community (SADC).</p>
<p>&quot;History has decreed that Southern Africa's journey on a similar path should begin later than yours,&quot; he said in the speech.</p>
<p>&quot;This does, however, give us the latecomer's advantage of learning from your experience and we are taking every chance to do so. That is one of the purposes of this visit.&quot;</p>
<p>Mandela said the 12-member SADC, like ASEAN, is creating its own free trade area and the two blocs should explore links.</p>
<p>Malaysia is this year's chairman of ASEAN, which also includes Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia in addition to the four countries on Mandela's tour.</p>
<p>South Africa is the current chairman of the SADC, which also includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>The two regions have a combined population of 600 million.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi told reporters after Mandela met Mahathir that the two groupings had already begun cooperating.</p>
<p>He said economic ministers from the two groupings met on the sidelines of the inaugural World Trade Organisation meeting in Singapore last December.</p>
<p>Abdullah said the African countries were looking for investments in infrastructure, energy, tourism and shipping.</p>
<p>Malaysia became the fourth-largest investor in South Africa last year -- behind more traditional partners Britain, Germany and the United States -- when the state oil firm Petronas bought 30 percent of listed South African company, Engen Oil.</p>
<p>Malaysia only resumed diplomatic ties with South Africa following the dismantling of apartheid.</p>
<p>Mandela flies to the Malaysian resort island of Langkawi on Saturday and returns to South Africa on Monday after a brief stopover in the Maldives.</p>
