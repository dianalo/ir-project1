<p>Teenager Martina Hingis left home fans gasping as she sped into the European indoor championship semifinals on Friday.</p>
<p>Swiss followers who have packed the Saalsporthalle for each of the 16-year-old's matches have witnessed less than one hour's action in each of her three appearances.</p>
<p>This time they were seated for only 55 minutes as Hingis despatched Sabine Appelmans 6-3 6-1.</p>
<p>&quot;I have confidence I never had before,&quot; said Hingis, who might have picked up a few pointers on a fast delivery during her visit to the Sauber Formula One team on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;This confidence, it all started with my doubles victory at Wimbledon and grew reaching the semifinals at the U.S. Open and winning last week in Filderstadt.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hitting the ball so well now I feel I can do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the one-sided score Appelmans broke Hingis's opening serve on way to a 3-1 first set lead.</p>
<p>But from that point on the fifth-seeded Swiss took complete control and won 11 of the next 12 games.</p>
<p>The victory set up a rematch of last week's final in Filderstadt against Germany's Anke Huber.</p>
<p>Third seed Huber made the last four with an equally impressive 6-1 6-1 win over Italy's Silvia Farina.</p>
<p>The other semifinal pits second seed Iva Majoli of Croatia against fourth seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Novotna advanced with a 6-4 6-2 triumph over Jennifer Capriati, denying the American her first semifinal appearance in three years.</p>
<p>Capriati, who has spent the last two years battling back from confrontations with the law, drug abuse and injury, has not made the last four of a tournament since the 1993 Canadian Open.</p>
<p>Bothered by tendinitis in her right elbow, the American struggled with her serve the entire match, holding it only once.</p>
<p>Novotna also had trouble as Capriati broke her five times.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wasn't going for it like I was in my earlier matches,&quot; said Capriati &quot;I was hesitant and she took advantage of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Holder Majoli eliminated sixth seed Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands 6-3 7-6.</p>
