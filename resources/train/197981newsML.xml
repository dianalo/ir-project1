<headline>INTERVIEW - Thorn seeks new markets for growth.</headline>

<p>British consumer electricals company Thorn Plc said on Monday it was planning to enter new markets in Europe and the U.S. to achieve higher growth in an otherwise sluggish global rental-purchase market.</p>
<p>Thorn reported a 10.5 percent rise in its six-month pretax profits on Monday to 87 million stg on a turnover of 785.1 million stg, up from last year's 733.9 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at more expansion...both through acquisitions and new stores,&quot; Thorn's group finance director Steve Marshall told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Marshall said the firm was planning to make a capital investment of between 300 and 350 million stg during the remaining six months of the current financial year.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of it would be spent on replenishing our assets,&quot; Marshall said.</p>
<p>Thorn, recently divorced from its long term partner EMI, said it was planning new expansions into U.S. rural places.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aiming for 400-500 places in the rural market over the next four to five years,&quot; Marshall said.</p>
<p>&quot;..Even if that requires product innovation,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In a statement, chief executive Mike Metcalf said the company added 15 stores making it a total of 62 rural stores in the United States.</p>
<p>Thorn's U.S. business, which grew 14 percent in the first six months, accounted for 35 percent of total sales.</p>
<p>The total rental-purchase market in the U.S., estimated at around $3.0 billion, is however, expected to show an overall decline over the full year due to tough market conditions, Metcalf said.</p>
<p>Thorn's new concept chain in Europe, Crazy George, opened 16 new stores taking the total to 47.  </p>
<p>Finance director Marshall said there would be 15 more coming up at an additional expenditure of 10-15 million stg.</p>
<p>Thorn is expected to diversify into new products, some of them being new credit-based propositions, he said.</p>
<p>The company was also planning to introduce lease of furniture through Radio Rentals in the UK where its turnover improved by only 2.1 percent with operating profit down 3.1 percent to 34.4 million stg.</p>
<p>Metcalf said the company would contest any damages award with regard to the law suits it was facing over its transactions in the U.S..  </p>
<p>The law suits have had an adverse effect on its share price in recent weeks by declining from around 380 p to around 340 on what analysts said was hammering by U.S. investors.</p>
<p>The company has, however, not made any provisions for possible lawsuit damages.</p>
