<p>The Hungarian government said on Thursday the Finance Ministry will continue investigations into irregularities of a bank consolidation programme started by the previous administration.</p>
<p>&quot;Further investigation is needed to determine personal responsibilities,&quot; government spokesman Elemer Kiss told a news conference following the regular cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Hungary's previous conservative government implemented three consecutive bank consolidation programmes between 1991 and 1994, raising the capital adequacy ratios of banks to eight percent in debt-for-equity swaps.</p>
<p>Some 315 billion forints of public money has been spent on the programmes, of which only 12 billion was injected by the current administration.</p>
<p>The investigation was conducted by a nine-strong team of the Government Supervisory Office.</p>
<p>Kiss cited one irregularity involving the now-liquidated that Ybl Bank, which received 2.7 billion forints to cover its debts.</p>
<p>He also said irregularities were found at banks still in operation, but said the government had decided not to disclose any more details while investigations were continuing.</p>
<p>Kiss said the Finance Ministry would forward the cases to the public prosecutor should the inquiry uncover any illegal dealings.</p>
<p>He added that all investigations will be completed by March 31.</p>
