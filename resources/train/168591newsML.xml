<p>A cost-cutting plan to shake-up Elkem Metals was on target and the impact from savings will start to be felt going into next year, the company's senior vice-president, Anthony LaRusso said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our program is on schedule,&quot; LaRusso told Reuters. &quot;Everybody is satisfied with the progress we have made so far. Obviously you would not be starting furnaces unless that were true.&quot;</p>
<p>LaRusso, for many years in senior positions at Cyprus Amax, was brought in last year to revamp the North American division of Elkem, Norway's energy-to-metals group.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday the company said it would start-up a ferro-silicon furnace at Alloy, WVa. in December.</p>
<p>In November last year LaRusso announced the company's intention to save the equivalent of $20 million on an annualised basis from improved efficiencies.</p>
<p>LaRusso said there have been layoffs but would not comment if any further redundancies were in the cards.</p>
<p>&quot;This program is not designed to make us world class. We have to do more to become world class and we will, but it's certainly designed to get us to be a sound, competitive organization,&quot; LaRusso said.  </p>
<p>Parent Elkem does not report Elkem Metals as a separate business unit in its results.</p>
<p>Alloy currently produces silicon metal using four furnaces. The fifth furnace will be started up to produce only ferro-silicon, standard 75 percent grade, a product used in the steelmaking and foundry industries.</p>
<p>LaRusso said Alloy will produce 17,000 to 20,000 tonnes of ferro-silicon a year, all for consumption in North America.  </p>
<p>Elkem Metals said it was starting-up the furnace because of reduced captive hydro-electric power generation in Norway where the company has a large ferro-alloy production base, and planned major maintenance in mid-1997 at its Chicoutimi ferro-silicon plant in Quebec.</p>
<p>Ferro-silicon is a very power intensive to make.</p>
<p>LaRusso said Chicoutimi's maintenance will take between a month to two months.</p>
<p>The furnace start-up at Alloy did not appear to be a temporary measure. &quot;There is no plan at any point in future to take it down,&quot; LaRusso said.  </p>
<p>Earlier this year Elkem Metals said it was seeking a minority partner in its Marietta, OH plant which makes manganese alloys.</p>
<p>Mexico's Compania Minera Autlan said at the time it was eyeing acquisition of a ferro-alloys plant in Ohio.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said in the past and we continue to say that we would like for a company to be a strategic minority partner, but nothing has come of it,&quot; LaRusso said.</p>
