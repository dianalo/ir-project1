<title>INDONESIA: INDONESIA STRESSES NEED FOR INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.</title>

<p>Indonesia's President Suharto said on Thursday that financial market authorities must maintain investor confidence in the country or risk capital flight.</p>
<p>&quot;I appeal to our capital market authorities to continue to maintain and enhance investor confidence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because once these investors lose confidence in our capital market, they will quickly and easily move their funds to capital markets in other countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Suharto made no mention of the weakness which has plagued Indonesia's foreign exchange and equity markets for several weeks.</p>
<p>The rupiah plunged to a historic low of 2,765 against the dollar on Thursday after the central Bank Indonesia said it would stop announcing its daily intervention and conversion bands with immediate effect.</p>
<p>The move was seen as amounting to free float of currency after the central bank hiked rates and sold dollars in a vain bid to protect the rupiah from heavy speculative attacks.</p>
<p>The stock market index has plunged about seven percent since the beginning of the month on the higher interest rates imposed by Bank Indonesia and a slew of rights issues.</p>
<p>They were sharply down in early trade on Thursday following the central bank rupiah announcement.</p>
<p>Suharto said Indonesia needed funds raised by the capital market to meet its development goals. He said the nation would require some 815 trillion rupiah ($307.5 billion) for its 1994-1999 development plan and about 77 percent of this was to come from the public.</p>
<p>&quot;It is precisely through the capital market that the substantial investment target can hopefully be reached,&quot; he said. &quot;A healthy capital market also reinforces the confidence of the international community that our economy is competitive to funnel funding resources more efficiently.&quot;</p>
<p>Suharto was speaking at the inauguration of a two-day conference being held to mark the 20th anniversary of Indonesia's Capital Market Supervisory Agency (Bapepam).</p>
<p>He noted also that domestic investment on Indonesia's stock market had increased in the past year, mainly through the rapid growth of local mutual funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The launching of mutual funds has in fact increased the number of shares being traded by local investors to more than 56 percent of the daily transaction on the Jakarta Stock Exchange,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, mutual funds have shown a rapid growth in terms of the number of institutions, investment managers and fund management.&quot;</p>
<p>Indonesia allowed the setting up of domestic mutual funds last year and 64 are now in operation. They now dominate transactions on the local bourse, where foreign investors until two years ago carried out about 70 percent of the daily trades.</p>
