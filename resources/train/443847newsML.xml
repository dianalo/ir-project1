<p>Some TAP-Air Portugal flights could be cancelled in the coming weeks after pilots start a protest on Saturday to stop flying during overtime and holiday periods, the president of the pilots' union said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We estimate that some 50 flights (out of a total of 3,500) -- mainly long- and medium-haul -- could be cancelled in the next month,&quot; Joao Soeiro, president of the Union of Civil Aviation Pilots (SPAC), told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The cancellations could start as soon as Saturday,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>An official source at state airline TAP, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that pilots would stop working overtime and during their holidays from Saturday onwards, but said that TAP's flight schedule was unaffected.</p>
<p>&quot;TAP's flight schedule is normal. We do not expect it to change for the time being,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The SPAC, which represents all of TAP's 430 pilots, has called the indefinite strike to protest against demands on pilots by the airline to work overtime and during holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;This protest is not about money. It is about insisting that we should take our full entitlement to time off, which is essential for the safety of flights,&quot; Soeiro said.</p>
<p>He denied recent local media reports that TAP pilots worked fewer hours on average than pilots of other European airlines.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes TAP asks its pilots to work more than the legal maximum of 45 hours per week,&quot; the union president said.</p>
<p>Soeiro said TAP flights most likely to be cancelled in the coming weeks were journeys on Airbus-340s to and from destinations such as Macau, Rio de Janeiro and Johannesburg and medium-haul European flights on Boeing 737s.</p>
<p>&quot;These flights have the fewest available pilots. The problem is that there are not enough pilots and the distribution of pilots is inadequate,&quot; Soeiro said.</p>
<p>TAP and union sources said that talks between the airline management and SPAC would continue next week to try to reach agreement on pilots' working hours. Regular meetings between the two sides this week had failed to avert the protest.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hopeful that we will find a solution to this problem soon, but it is impossible to predict when the protest will end,&quot; Soeiro said.</p>
<p>The two sides declined to give details of their talks.</p>
<p>SPAC represents a total of 1,100 civil aviation pilots in Portugal, including pilots from other airlines.</p>
