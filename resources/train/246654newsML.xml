<title>USA: U.S. Mid-Atlantic power eases on mild weather.</title>
<headline>U.S. Mid-Atlantic power eases on mild weather.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of bulk electricity in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. softened Tuesday, as milder weather was expected to blanket the region Wednesday through early next week and natural gas prices faltered, market sources said.</p>
<p>Firm, peak Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM)</p>
<p>electricity for Wednesday was quoted at $25.75-26.50 per</p>
<p>megawatt hour (MWh), as compared with Monday's $26.75-27.50</p>
<p>trading range.</p>
<p>&quot;The buyers are in control. They came in a little lower today so prices were lower,&quot; one market source said, noting the mild weather forecast in the Northeast was weakening demand.</p>
<p>PECO Energy's 1,055 megawatt (MW) Limerick 2 nuclear power unit in Pottstown, Pa., was still shut early Tuesday, but the news had little effect on the market. The company said the unit would possibly restart this weekend.</p>
<p>One reason for the market's lack of response to the unscheduled outages is the weather. Temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic states are forecast to rise to two to five degrees Fahrenheit above-normal through Saturday but then return to near-normal Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak PJM electricity for Wednesday held in the notional range of $15.00-$16.00, traders said. PJM power deliveries for the balance of December traded in a tighter range from $27.00 to about $27.50 per MWh, as compared with the $26.50-27.75 range seen on Monday. January/February 1997 PJM electricity softened by about $1 to about $31.50, while the March 97 market also lost about $1 to the $25.25-25.50 area.</p>
<p>Second-quarter 1997 PJM prices were still thinly talked in the $23.00-23.50 range.</p>
<p>July/August 1997 PJM power remained in the $32.00-$32.35 range, market sources said, while third-quarter 1997 PJM was still in the $28.75-$29.10 area.</p>
<p>Separately, Maine Yankee's 910 MW power plant, which was expected to restart Tuesday morning, is still shut. The company said it expects to return to the grid &quot;in a few days.&quot; Also, Northeast Utilities reported earlier Tuesday that about 26,400 electricity customers in Connecticut were still without service, down significantly from Monday's tally of 100,000. About 22,000 and 2,800 customers were out of service in New Hampshire and western Massachusetts, respectively. Also giving more leverage to buyers were the softer natural gas prices at the New York city-gate for Wednesday delivery. Traders said prices were down about 15 cents from Monday to about $4.05 per million British thermal units.     --H McCulloch, New York Power Desk +212-859-1628 (c) Reuters Limited 1996</p>
