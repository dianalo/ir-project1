<title>UK: LME copper eases as stock-based rally fades.</title>
<headline>LME copper eases as stock-based rally fades.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices settled back from early-morning highs during Tuesday LME ring trading, reflecting freer offers of metal and less concern over high upside call options, traders said.</p>
<p>But business was erratic, which underlines the high level of uncertainty in the market at present, and there could easily be another spike to the upside between now and the December option declarations on Wednesday morning, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not rule anything out at the moment. The big one ($2,600 strike) may be safe, but there are still some big options under there,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>At present, December copper is around $2,270, which suggests that the strikes at $2,250, $2,300, and $2,300 are likely to be the focus of attention.</p>
<p>Earlier today LME stocks rose by just 1,000 tonnes, a smaller than expected increase, which helped the market rally from initial lows near $2,150 support up to just below $2,200.</p>
<p>This level proved difficult to surmount, and with spreads looking softer the market subsequently settled into the middle of the day's range, against a background of cash selling. Last kerb business was at $2,172, down $15 from Monday's kerb.</p>
<p>Cash/threes was at a $150 backwardation, while cash/day and cash/week showed premiums of $3 and $17 respectively.</p>
<p>There was very little significant action throughout the rest of the complex, and trends mostly matched copper, particularly aluminium which was unable to build on early gains.</p>
<p>Last business was at an unchanged $1,518, with the market expected to continue to unravel overbought signals, traders added.</p>
<p>Zinc lost ground due to an 1,850-tonne stock rise, but there was some support around $1,060, with last kerb business at $1,059, down $7. Lead held fairly steady in sluggish conditions, partly aided by the output problems at Doe Run. Last trade was at $685, a loss of just $3.</p>
<p>Tin fell away under the $6,100 level, and closed the kerb at $6,065, down $35. Nickel was pressured by liquidation as stocks rose, and dropped below $6,800, trading last at $6,780, down $60.</p>
<p>The alloy market was neglected, but hardly moved. Three months was indicated at a stable $1,360/65.</p>
