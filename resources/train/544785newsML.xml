<p>France's ruling centre-right coalition has agreed a broad campaign manifesto which pledges to cap public spending and help create jobs through lower payroll charges on low wages, the daily Le Monde said on Monday.</p>
<p>The manifesto, due to be unveiled on Tuesday, also contains a promise to meet the target for a single European currency, limit the number of government ministers to 15 or 20 and pursue decentralisation at both regional and departmental level, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>France will vote in a two-round snap parliamentary election on May 25 and June 1.</p>
<p>Le Monde said the centre-right coalition had borrowed a few ideas from the left-wing opposition in the five-page document agreed in broad terms on Saturday evening, including a cut in taxes on home-buyers and consolidating the pensions system.</p>
<p>The text notes the coalition's determination &quot;to stabilise public spending so that it does not progress faster than inflation&quot;, but does not elaborate, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Le Monde quoted the manifesto as pledging to forge ahead with privatisation, reform local taxes on companies, boost job creation schemes for small businesses and guarantee minimum benefits for the poorest.</p>
<p>On Europe, the text says the aim is to &quot;succeed in achieving the euro (currency) on January 1, 1999&quot; and also to institute &quot;a true social Europe which would avoid unfair competition among European countries&quot;.</p>
<p>It pledges to ban politicians holding two offices -- as is the case with Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who is also mayor of Bordeaux -- to change regional voting procedures and to make the judicial system more accessible and faster.</p>
<p>Juppe said on Sunday that the coalition would carry out a 40-day flurry of legislation if re-elected.</p>
<p>Measures would include caps on public spending for five years, cuts in some taxes, efforts to help small businesses, a law to help the poorest and a review of whether to close a controversial nuclear plant.</p>
