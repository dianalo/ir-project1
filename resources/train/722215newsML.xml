<p>Australian bond yields edged higher as the market squared up ahead of the weekend and in front the U.S. PPI later on Friday, but underlying sentiment remains bullish for a policy easing in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank's silence on interest rates after a disappointing employment report on Thursday came as no great surprise as it would have been seen as a panic reaction.</p>
<p>But if the central bank is holding out for the inflation and wages reports later this month before such a move, as many analysts believe, there would seem be little reason for it to hold back after the August board meeting.  </p>
<p>A Reuters poll of economists taken on Friday showed flat median forecasts for headline inflation for the second quarter for just up 0.6 percent on the year, while the policy sensitive underlying rate is seen at 0.4 percent on the quarter.</p>
<p>This would give an annual rate of 1.7 percent and below the central bank's 2.0 to 3.0 percent target.</p>
<p>There is also pleasing news for the bank with average weekly ordinary time earnings for the second quarter expected to run at 4.1 percent annually an below its perceived 4.5 percent comfort zone.  </p>
<p>And while the housing sector was seen as one of the bright sectors of the economy, today's release of May housing finance showed that it is still in a modest stage of recovery.</p>
<p>The data fell a larger than expected 8.4 percent, albeit coming after a sharp 12.2 percent jump in April.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the housing recovery remains on track. Given weakness in other sectors, however, we still see another rate cut as more likely than not after the August RBA meeting,&quot; said David Bassanese, senior economist at Bankers Trust Australia.  </p>

<p>The local market slightly underperformed the U.S. and Canada after Thursday's sharp tightening. However, it narrowed to New Zealand curve following a larger than expected March quarter current account and after the RBNZ warned again that monetary conditions were too easy.  </p>
