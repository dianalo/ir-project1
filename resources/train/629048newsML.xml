<title>UK: Millions of Britons to enjoy UK's Halifax windfalls.</title>
<headline>Millions of Britons to enjoy UK's Halifax windfalls.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Millions of Britons are set to enjoy hefty cash windfalls as the Halifax Building Society ditches 144 years of mutuality and joins the stock exchange on Monday.</p>
<p>Some 7.6 million Halifax members will become shareholders in the flotation. Those who have decided to sell their shares immediately could pick up average windfalls of up to 2,300 pounds ($3,770).</p>
<p>Halifax's brokers Merrill Lynch and Cazenove auctioned 23 percent of its flotation shares on Friday to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Analysts said this auction will have seen aggressive bidding from institutions which missed out on the strong early performance of another building society, the Alliance &amp; Leicester, when it floated last month.</p>
<p>The result of the auction of almost 570 million shares will be announced on Monday morning at 0730 GMT.</p>
<p>Halifax has guaranteed shareholders selling their entitlement at auction will receive at least 415 pence per share. But analysts predict the shares will be worth considerably more than this.</p>
<p>They believe the auction price could be between 650 and 720 pence per share, valuing the company at 18 billion pounds and making it one of Britain's 10 largest.</p>
<p>Until now Halifax, like Britain's other building societies, has been owned by its savers and borrowers -- known as its members.</p>
<p>Last February, they voted in favour of a proposal for the society to convert to a public limited company and float on the stock exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts say Halifax will be a leader in the financial services industry, with a profitable existing franchise and extensive capital reserves -- estimated at more than three billion pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;The flexibility Halifax's listing provides it with, together with its dominant shares in both the mortgage and liquid savings market, suggest it is likely to be a significant competitive threat,&quot; BZW analyst Timothy Sykes said in a recent report.</p>
<p>This echoed an earlier report by Goldman Sachs which said Halifax would &quot;ultimately be one of the winners in the current battle for supremacy in the UK financial services market&quot;.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said that Halifax's large customer base, with 20 million existing customer, and strong brand name should facilitate further development of that franchise.</p>
<p>But Goldman, believes intense competition in the core mortgage and short-term savings markets may erode profitability in the near term. ($ = 0.610 British Pounds)</p>
