<p>Troubled U.S./Swedish drugs company Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn on Thursday forecast that negative sales and profit trends would continue for the rest of this year, but said restructuring measures should turn the company around in 1998.</p>
<p>After weeks of market rumours, P&amp;U confirmed its second quarter of 1997 was weak, saying earnings per share (EPS) would not exceed the first quarter EPS of 37 U.S. cents and that negative sales and profit trend would continue through 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;But the positive things in the new programme could overshadow the poor results,&quot; Ohman analyst Gustav Lenman told Reuters. &quot;We will see a weak 1997 but 1998 is looking better.&quot;</p>
<p>After an hour of trading in Stockholm, P&amp;U shares were one crown higher at 277.5 crowns.</p>
<p>P&amp;U's new chief executive Fred Hassan, appointed in June, said the company planned various measures to simplify structure and decision-making systems, clarify responsibilities and concentrate investments on research and development.</p>
<p>&quot;Although they are initially concentrated on growth, we expect they will also give important cost savings which will be quantified later this year,&quot; Hassan said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to receive benefits beginning in 1998 from the actions now being taken.&quot;</p>
<p>The moves by Hassan, successor to John Zabriskie who left the company suddenly in January, were welcomed by analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it looks quite good. Despite the veiled profit warning, it seems the new CEO is doing all the right things, that should have been done long ago,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Janet Dyson.</p>
<p>The dismantling of the group's three pharmaceutical product centres, or PPCs, in Europe and the U.S. was seen as particularly positive, increasing accountability to Hassan and stopping duplication of costs.</p>
<p>Sales, marketing and Phase IV clinical research will come under one single worldwide umbrella while research and development will now come under one head, Goran Ando.</p>
<p>Analysts said P&amp;U had no choice after recent rumours but to clarify its second quarter.</p>
<p>The warning was tantamount to the fourth profit warning in nine months from P&amp;U which has been beset with problems since it was formed in November 1995 through the merger of Michigan-based Upjohn and Sweden's Pharmacia.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knew they had a difficult quarter and that sales and profit were under pressure,&quot; said analyst James McKean from Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing now is to stop the declining sales in the existing portfolio and boost its new products.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said a major problem faced by the company was that its portfolio consisted mainly of mature products and it needed to focus more on key products.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a strong pipeline but these products need to be launched and need time to grow before compensating for the other products,&quot; Lenman said.</p>
<p>The company also needed to resolve its generic problems in the U.S. but this would probably take more time, analysts said.</p>
<p>But the restructuring programme was seen as step in the right direction although the benefits would not hit the bottom line until 1998, and maybe not till the second half.</p>
<p>&quot;The structure has needed to be cleared up,&quot; said McKean.</p>
<p>&quot;What they need now is to get a couple of good quarters behind them to get some confidence back in the stock.&quot;</p>
