<p>Rather than defuse the Zaire crisis, the appointment of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister has touched off further political turmoil, Zairean politicians said.</p>
<p>But preparations for the first talks between Zaire's warring sides went ahead in South Africa despite rebel rejection of the government's latest offer of power-sharing.</p>
<p>On his first day back on the job he lost amid controversy in 1993, Tshisekedi unveiled a 26-member government excluding associates of President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>He reserved six key portfolios for Laurent Kabila's rebels who have seized a quarter of the vast Central African nation. The rebels, who insist Mobutu must go, rejected the offer.</p>
<p>They also rejected offers by Tshisekedi to enter direct talks in Zaire.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi announced the dissolution of parliament which is dominated by supporters of the ailing Mobutu.</p>
<p>Parliament's legislative role would revert to the sovereign national conference that launched Zaire's democratic transition seven years ago and, in theory, stripped Mobutu of most powers.</p>
<p>&quot;Tshisekedi has opened a second front against Mobutu,&quot; said a local commentator, referring to advances by Kabila's rebels who have put Mobutu's army on the run in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>A close Mobutu ally denounced Tshisekedi's moves as unconstitutional. Other Mobutu supporters said the prime minister risked being removed immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;He has no power to dissolve parliament. It is madness,&quot; said Banza Mukalayi, vice-president of Mobutu's Popular Revolutionary Movement party. &quot;Unless we return to the days of dictatorship Tshisekedi alone cannot do this. The parliament itself cannot accept it.&quot;</p>
<p>Another Mobutu ally said the military would not accept the move, adding that Tshisekedi could find himself for the third time in six years removed from office.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion his first confrontation will be with the president's political family which he has not taken into account,&quot; Mobutu's spokesman Kabuya Lumuna said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it will go to parliament because Tshisekedi has questioned the constitution that's now in place.&quot;</p>
<p>Mobutu, who has cancer, has seen his 31-year grip on Zaire weakened by rebel advances. The rebels took up arms in October in a dispute over Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi has huge support in Kinshasa's teeming slums where he has already won some popular applause for his bold declarations. But even some allies fear he has achieved this by inciting yet another institutional crisis and threatening the stability of the capital.</p>
<p>Mobutu's special envoy arrived in South Africa on Thursday for the crucial weekend face-to-face talks with the rebels.</p>
<p>Honore Ngbanda, Mobutu's security adviser and chairman of the eight-member official negotiating team, refused to comment on the rebels' flat rejection of a place in Tshisekedi's government.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't come here for that. We came here to talk, and good talks for responsible men do not take place by means of press communiques but around the negotiating table,&quot; Ngbanda told reporters.</p>
<p>A plane carrying representatives of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, led by Bizima Karaha, rebel foreign affairs commissioner, was expected to arrive late on Thursday.</p>
<p>But it was unclear, given the rebels' flat rejection of Kinshasa's power-sharing offer, whether peace talks would get off the ground on Saturday as proposed.</p>
<p>In Washington, the Defence Department said the U.S. Navy helicopter ship Nassau was in position off the west coast of Africa, ready to help in the evacuation of Americans from Zaire if required.</p>
