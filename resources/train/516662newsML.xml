<p>Oil's headlong rush lower continued apace on Thursday after an early rally driven by weather forecasts pointing to higher heating fuel demand in the United States proved to be short-lived.</p>
<p>World benchmark Brent crude futures for June delivery closed nine cents down at $17.72 a barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange, having touched a session high of $17.95.</p>
<p>Dealers said forecasts of below-normal temperatures until at least Saturday in the U.S. Northeast, the world's biggest heating oil market gave the market a brief boost in early trade.</p>
<p>But the market later gave way to bearish underlying fundamental factors, in particular high industry stocks -- the legacy of a relatively mild northern hemisphere winter -- and robust supply growth from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).</p>
<p>&quot;Today's rally is just a pit stop on the race down,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at brokers Smith, Barney in London.</p>
<p>Even a slowdown in global tanker sailings, suggesting suppliers may be adjusting to lower second quarter demand, appeared to be too little too late to prevent oil markets heading further back towards nine-month lows seen last week.</p>
<p>&quot;The carry over from the winter will continue to impact on the system for a while yet,&quot; said Roy Mason of industry consultants Oil Movements.</p>
<p>&quot;Offshore oil accumulated early in the year is swelling onshore stocks and will go on doing that for a while yet. The cavalry is on the way, but the fort may not last,&quot; he said in a weekly report.</p>
<p>After shedding $7 a barrel, or nearly 30 percent since the start of the year, oil prices have been treading water in anticipation of a surge in U.S. gasoline demand to fuel the summer driving season.</p>
<p>But the country's leading oil industry association said on Wednesday that domestic gasoline supplies are expected to be more than sufficient to satisfy even the most bullish forecasts for demand growth.</p>
<p>In its annual outlook for the summer, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said gasoline supply would meet demand, even if it grew by 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy said it expected gasoline demand to grow by 1.8 percent this month.</p>
<p>But U.S. heating oil prices provided a degree of relief onThursday as an early spring cold spell in the U.S. Northeast left one major supplier, Sun Co Inc, out of product until late next week.</p>
<p>Private forecaster Weather Services Corp (WSC) said temperatures would run two to six degrees Fahrenheit below normal on Thursday, dipping to between six and 12 degrees below normal on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the possibility of some snow developing in the higher elevations on Friday,&quot; WSC said.</p>
