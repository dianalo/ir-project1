<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday Israel would forge ahead with plans to expand Jewish settlements, the crux of a bitter dispute clouding prospects for peace talks with the PLO and Syria.</p>
<p>Netanyahu spoke hours after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority sent Israel a letter urging the Jewish state to halt immediately all settlement or risk &quot;confrontation and disaster&quot;.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, whose plans for expanding Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights have infuriated Syria and the Palestinians, told a news conference on Monday:</p>
<p>&quot;There is no change on the Golan Heights, any more than in the Yesha (West Bank and Gaza) areas. We always said that we will continue with the policy of construction in existing settlements.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after taking office in June, Netanyahu sent shock waves throughout the Arab world by rescinding the previous Labour government's freeze on new settlement building and nullifying Labour's policy of trading occupied land for peace.</p>
<p>PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinian Authority had urged Netanyahu's government to &quot;give peace a chance by immediately revoking plans and military orders to expand settlements and to halt all settlement activities&quot;.</p>
<p>Settlement construction, seen by both sides as establishing &quot;facts on the ground&quot; beyond the bounds of talks, has been condemned as an obstacle to peace by Israel's ally Washington. But recent U.S. reaction to Netanyahu's moves has been muted.</p>
<p>Stressing that his hardline government had refrained from approving the establishment of new settlements, Netanyahu said: &quot;This can only be authorised by the full cabinet, and there has been no such decision.&quot;</p>
<p>Arab leaders have dismissed the distinction as whitewash.</p>
<p>Erekat said plans to expand existing settlements &quot;constitute not only a flagrant violation of the agreement signed, but also a serious threat that will bury the hope of peace&quot;.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has given the go-ahead for thousands of new homes in West Bank settlements, and hawkish ex-general Ariel Sharon, his minister for infrastructure, is overseeing planning for 900 housing units on the Israeli-held Golan Heights.</p>
<p>Erekat said &quot;continuation of such policies will bring both of our peoples back to the square of confrontation and disaster&quot;.</p>
<p>Syria's official press has accused Israel of pushing the region to war by taking the first steps toward building new houses on the strategic Golan plateau, captured by the Jewish state in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Under the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal, Israel has handed over parts of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian self-rule but the fate of Jewish settlements has been left to &quot;final-status&quot; talks that have been suspended since Netanyahu took office.</p>
<p>&quot;The interim accord also states that neither side shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of Palestinian territories or the issues of final status, such as Jerusalem and settlements,&quot; Erekat said.</p>
<p>Some 130,000 Jews live in settlements scattered among the more than two million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>About 15,000 Jews and 18,000 Druze Arabs live on the Golan.</p>
