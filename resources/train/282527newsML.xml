<p>-- LABOUR'S CORPORATE TAX PLAN WORRIES BUSINESS</p>
<p>A group of businesspeople, convened under the auspices of the left-of-centre think-tank the Institute for Public Policy Research, is set to criticise one of the Labour party's central proposals for encouraging long-term investment through the reform of corporate taxation. The group, titled the Commission on Public Policy and British Business, will publish a report next month which will dismiss as 'unworkable' Labour's plan to vary the rate of capital gains tax according to the length of time an asset has been held.</p>
<p>-- HOUSE PRICES 'TO INCREASE BY 7-8 PER CENT'</p>
<p>The Halifax building society, the largest in the UK, has predicted that house prices will rise by between 7 per cent and 8 per cent in 1997 and 1998. The Halifax also predicts that UK recovery will be stable, neither running out of control as in the 1980s nor being derailed by an expected moderate rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>-- EMPLOYEES' MORALE 'IN FREE FALL'</p>
<p>The most recent annual survey from independent employee opinion survey company ISR International Survey Research has revealed that British workers in the 1990s have suffered a substantial decline in morale and motivation at work. The survey found the largest decline since the beginning of the decade in worker feelings of security with their current employer.</p>
<p>-- RATE OF BUSINESS FAILURES STEADIES</p>
<p>A survey from business information group Dunn and Bradstreet has shown that fewer businesses failed in 1996 than in 1995. The survey found that 41,107 companies went out of business in England, Scotland and Wales this year, compared to 41,303 last year. The figures reveal that the rate at which failures are declining has slowed to a trickle.</p>
<p>-- BID FEES ESTIMATED TO BE RECORD 1.1 BILLION STERLING</p>
<p>A survey of business takeovers in the UK in 1996 has revealed that 1,689 deals were completed, with a value totalling 55.9 billion stg. The figures compare with 1,694 deals in 1995, totalling 67.7 billion stg. The survey, from Acquisitions Monthly, suggests that about 1.1 billion stg was earned by the City in fees from takeovers in 1996.</p>
<p>-- AEGON BUYS PROVIDIAN OPERATION</p>
<p>Dutch insurance group Aegon has announced the $3.5 billion acquisition of the insurance operations of US company Providian. Shares in the Dutch company rose 11 per cent on news of the deal, which will make Aegon the biggest insurer in the Netherlands. The deal, which follows a year of dramatic consolidation in western insurance markets, also lifts Aegon from 17th to 12th among listed life assurers worldwide.</p>
<p>-- NEW YORK UTILITIES POISED FOR $2.8 BILLION MERGER</p>
<p>The Long Island Lighting Company (Lilco) is set to agree a merger with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the New York-based utility which neighbours Lilco's catchment area. The $2.8 billion deal values Lilco at $23 a share, and will bring to an end the troubled history of the company. Lilco has the dubious record of charging America's highest electricity rates, about double the US average, mainly due to debts totalling $5 billion following construction of a nuclear power plant which was never allowed to open.</p>
<p>-- FRANCE TELECOM TAKES STEP TOWARDS SELL-OFF</p>
<p>French state telecoms operator France Telecom is set to take a further step forward in preparation for a partial privatisation next year when it becomes a company with its own capital. From New Year's Day, France Telecom will have initial share capital of FFr25 billion (2.8 billion stg) , comprising 1 billion shares with a nominal value of FFr25 each. Under the new rules of the company, a government representative will be appointed with the role of ensuring that the company's general policies and orientation are in line with the government's wishes.</p>
<p>-- NORTHERN ELECTRIC RECOMMENDS BID</p>
<p>English regional electricity company Northern Electric has finally recommended that shareholders accept a hostile 782 million stg bid from US utility CalEnergy. The move, which comes six days after CalEnergy announced it had support from 50.3 per cent of Northern shareholders, is likely to curtail speculation that a group of institutional investors, led by the Prudential, was prepared to hold out as minority shareholders. Under takeover rules, CalEnergy needs to win 90 per cent control before being able to conduct a compulsory purchase of Northern's remaining shares.</p>
<p>-- SPRING SALE PLANNED FOR RUMP OF REPSOL</p>
<p>Spain is planning to launch an ambitious programme of privatisations next year with the sale in February of 21 per cent of state-owned equity in telecoms operator Telefonica followed by the Spring sale of the remaining 10 per cent stake the government owns in the oil, gas and chemicals conglomerate Repsol. The Repsol sale will earn the government about $1.1 billion at current prices, and is expected to take place in March or April. BMC +44-171-377-1742</p>
