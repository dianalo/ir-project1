<p>A House of Representatives committee on Thursday approved an $8.4 billion emergency spending bill to aid victims of natural disasters in more than 20 states and fund U.S. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.</p>
<p>The bill was originally supposed to be far smaller but spending ballooned as President Bill Clinton and lawmakers struggled to cope with emergency needs across the country including devastating floods in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Before passing it by voice vote the panel added an extra $200 million in emergency aid requested by Clinton, just back from a visit to the weather-ravaged state. The bill includes $5.5 billion to help states rebound from natural disasters, $2 billion for overseas military operations and $98.5 million for an array of other programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a start. It's the best we can do right now. We hope there's nobody in America that won't be assisted&quot; in moving back into their homes or rebuilding, committee chairman Bob Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, said.</p>
<p>The disaster aid, paid for by cutting a host of other programmes, was relatively noncontroversial. But the committee spent hours debating non-related issues including aid to legal immigrants, farm programmes and nutrition aid for children</p>
<p>Florida Democrat Carrie Meek offered, but withdrew, an amendment to push back for two years the deadline for cutting legal immigrants off federal aid rolls. Under a welfare law passed last year, hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants will lose nutrition and disability benefits by Aug. 22.</p>
<p>Republican House leaders on Wednesday tentatatively agreed to give states $125 million this year to aid the immigrants but are working out details.</p>
<p>The bill did not include a White House request for advance funding of $921 million to pay prior years' dues to the United Nations and other international organisations. The funds are not to be disbursed until 1999 but the administration wanted the money as a show of good faith that the United States was prepared to pay its huge debt to the United Nations provided the world body made requested reforms.</p>
