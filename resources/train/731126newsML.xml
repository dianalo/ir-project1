<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian stocks sink to month low by close.</title>
<headline>Australian stocks sink to month low by close.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian share market sank to its lowest close since June 12 on Tuesday with profit-takers moving in as hopes of an imminent interest rate cut were dampened by the weak Australian dollar.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index shed 35.4 points to 2,637.6, touching bottom late in the day at 2,632.1.</p>
<p>The soft tone from Monday spilled over into Tuesday's trade, the selling continuing on light volume yet again.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very much a repeat of yesterday -- there is not great business but it's all on the sell side,&quot; said a Sydney broker.</p>
<p>The most compelling reason for the weakness seemed to be the dashed hopes of a quick interest rate cut in the face of the falling Australian dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the conventional wisdom in any case and the market is sliding as a result,&quot; said head of equities at Intersuisse, Andrew Sekely, although he noted the selling was not confined to the interest rate-sensitive sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;Notwithstanding that, the metals stocks, which should be helped by the soft Aussie dollar, are not doing much at all.&quot;</p>
<p>The interest rate sensitive sectors were hardest hit on the day, with the banking index shedding nearly two percent and the building materials index diving over three percent compared to an overall market loss of 1.3 percent.</p>
<p>Among the building materials stocks, Boral and CSR were hit hardest, both losing nearly five percent to A$4.06 (US$2.98) and A$4.82 respectively.</p>
<p>In the banks, National Australia Bank, which makes up about 34 percent of the sector benchmark, fell 2.2 percent to A$19.168, while Westpac Banking Corp fell 3.3 percent to A$7.67. Other losses were broadly spread, albeit at reduced levels.</p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to four, while about 26 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.7350)</p>
