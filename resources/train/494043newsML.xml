<p>The New York City Water Finance Authority Tuesday said that resolving differences over a watershed pact had cleared the way for it to sell $200 million of commercial paper, an offering that had been delayed about two months.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pleased to announce that we can proceed with our Series Five commercial paper issuance, which has been delayed by negotiations between the city and the comptroller over the upstate watershed agreement,&quot; said a spokesman for the authority.  </p>
<p>The remarketing of the commercial paper was divided equally between J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>The Water Finance Authority said it also planned to sell about $600 million of tax-exempt, fixed-rate bonds on April 29. While that deal was not delayed, had the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi, and New York City been unable to come to an agreement, the offering might have been postponed.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan was selected as the book-running manager for the bond sale.</p>
<p>New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi earlier said he had won major improvements to the $2.2 billion watershed agreement between the city, the state and upstate communities, though he warned questions remained about how successful and cost-effective the pact will prove. The agreement aims to protect the city's drinking water by purchasing land around its 19 reservoirs yet still allowing the upstate areas to grow. Hevesi said he negotiated a much stronger monitoring program, additional studies, and other improvements.</p>
