<p>A global rush led by Japanese carmakers for a place in India's fast-growing automobile market has set the stage for a glut and some players may be driven out, Japanese industry sources say.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them may have to withdraw from the Indian market in the future,&quot; said Nobuaki Yanachi, senior analyst at Kankaku Securities Research. &quot;There will be several issues to work out, including component sourcing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Car demand in India, which has a population of more than 900 million, grew 25 percent to around 350,000 cars in 1996 and is expected to rise to 400,000-510,000 this year, fuelled by growing enonomic activity, Tokyo analysts said. By the year 2000, they see it ballooning to 800,000-900,000 cars.</p>
<p>But industry sources said if every carmaker met its current planned production volume in India, supply would reach one million units by 2000, exceeding projected demand.</p>
<p>They said it would be difficult to export the excess from India since most of its neighbours already produce cars and the rest of Asia is not expecting such high car demand as in India.</p>
<p>&quot;Even Indian demand is unlikely to hit one million units by 2000,&quot; said Nomura Research analyst Seiji Sugiura.</p>
<p>The key to how many cars India can absorb is held by Maruti Udyog Ltd, a fifty-fifty joint venture between the Indian government and Japan's Suzuki Motor , Sugiura said.</p>
<p>If Maruti, which controls 70 percent of the market, delays boosting capacity and introducing new models, the others will have chance to bite off a piece of its pie, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Maruti has said it hopes to boost its production capacity to 500,000 units from the current 300,000 in order to remain at the top, but has yet to find ways to raise the funds to do so.</p>
<p>Suzuki agreed three years ago with the government of former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to expand Maruti's capacity, but Rao lost his seat in last April's general election.</p>
<p>Suzuki restarted talks with India's new ruling coalition last August, but earlier this month India said it had decided not to allow a change in Maruti's equity structure.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no idea yet on how to raise funds,&quot; a Suzuki spokesman said.&quot;But we believe that Maruti continues to excel against any other Indian maker in competitiveness since its local procurement rate stands at 95 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>India virtually bans the import of assembled vehicles, imposing a nearly 200 percent tariff, and also slaps a tariff of between 25 and 50 percent on imports of components. &quot;Some of the other makers are unlikely to survive in India because there are just too many there,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Large Western auto companies including Mercedes-Benz , Peugeot , GM unit Adam Opel , Chrysler , BMW and Volkswagen are either in India or are studying the feasibility of entering it.</p>
<p>Asian players considering entering India or already established there include Honda , Mitsubishi Motors , Toyota , Hyundai Motor and Daewoo Motor .</p>
<p>Italy's Fiat Spa , meanwhile, said last week that it expected the Indian government to approve its proposal very soon to set up a joint carmaking firm with a local partner.</p>
