<p>Saudi Arabia and Yemen on Sunday began a new round of talks in Sanaa aimed at settling a long-standing border dispute, a Yemeni official said.</p>
<p>Officials from both sides were due to discuss issues related to the demarcation of the border between oil giant Saudi Arabia and Yemen, he said.</p>
<p>Yemen has hinted it might resort to international arbitration if more than a year of talks with Saudi Arabia fail to settle the 60-year-old border dispute.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and Yemen had several minor clashes in a border area potentially rich in oil and gas before the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding in 1995 to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh had in the summer complained that the committee was making slow progress and called for a summit with Saudi Arabia to speed up the talks.</p>
<p>The committee has met scores of times since 1995.</p>
<p>Yemen's relations with Gulf Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, have improved in the last few years. Sanaa angered Gulf Arab governments when it appeared to side with Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
