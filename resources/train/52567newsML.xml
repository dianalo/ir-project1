<p>Former Polish leader Lech Walesa urged visiting French President Jacques Chirac on Friday to take firm, &quot;manly decisions&quot; on securing Poland's admission to NATO.</p>
<p>Walesa, concerned over Chirac's stress on reassuring Russia over a planned expansion of the Western defence pact, also welcomed his assurances in Warsaw of French backing for Poland's key foreign policy goals of entry into both the EU and NATO.</p>
<p>&quot;On NATO, manly decisions are needed which do not humiliate anyone or cause divisions in Europe but are manly,&quot; said Walesa, who led the Solidarity union to its 1989 victory over communism.</p>
<p>Walesa, who discussed Poland's EU and NATO aspirations with Chirac on Friday, praised him as a rare politician who, when in power, kept promises he made in opposition. &quot;I discussed such matters with Mr Chirac when he was still in opposition, and I am impressed that as president he is keeping to his word and acting on it. This rarely happens,&quot; he said after the half-hour meeting in a Warsaw hotel.</p>
<p>Chirac told Polish parliament on Thursday that he hoped Poland would be in the European Union by the year 2000 -- widely seen as an optimistic date.</p>
<p>He also backed Poland's membership bid in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) but emphasised the need to avoid humiliating Russia, which opposes the pact's expansion as a threat to its security, or renewing divisions across Europe.</p>
<p>Chirac called for a summit on NATO with its 16 members, candidate states from the former Soviet bloc, and other states including Russia.</p>
<p>Walesa was a militant advocate of NATO membership during his presidency, which ended after his election defeat by ex-communist Aleksander Kwasniewski last year.</p>
<p>The former shipyard electrician, who remains a prominent voice in Poland's opposition, has long sought full, fast Polish entry, unqualified by compromise with Russia.</p>
<p>Chirac flew to the historic southern city of Krakow after meeting Walesa for the last leg of his three-day Polish visit -- his first as president to Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>He was applauded by several thousand well-wishers as he strolled round Krakow's main square in the rain. Flower sellers gave him a bouquet and youngsters regaled him with French folk songs.</p>
<p>He will also visit the former Auschwitz death camp where World War Two Nazi invaders murdered up to 1.5 million people, most of them Jews brought from around Europe including France.</p>
