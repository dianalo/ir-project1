<p>An institutional investor in Olivetti said on Tuesday he was delighted the Italian technology company had agreed to sell its loss-making personal computer division, which he said had been &quot;haemorrhaging cash&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just delighted they've got rid of the business and seem to have got a very good price for it,&quot; Talal Shakerchi, head of European equities at London-based fund managers Old Mutual, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shakerchi says that according to his valuation, Olivetti shares should be worth 1,600 lire each -- a far cry from their trading level on Tuesday of around 675 lire.  </p>
<p>Old Mutual, which has a stake of just under two percent of Olivetti, was one of the institutional investors who consistently urged the company to sell the ailing PC division.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as you've got a company in the group which is destroying value, nobody is going to be willing to pay full value for the assets because they are being destroyed over time,&quot; Shakerchi said.</p>
<p>Olivetti announced on Monday that it would get 250-300 billion lire from the sale to a new company called Piedmont, in which mysterious U.S. financier Edward Gottesman has a stake.  </p>
<p>Old Mutual's confidence in Olivetti's management has been boosted since the group's new chief executive Roberto Colaninno started delivering on his short-term promises -- such as the sale of the division.</p>
<p>It now hopes Colaninno will see his long-term aims realised. The institution is waiting to see a better control of working capital and Olivetti's businesses having a positive cash flow by the end of the year, Shakerchi said.</p>
<p>Other fund managers such as Baring Asset Management either declined comment on the sale or were not immediately available. -- Kirstin Ridley, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7987</p>
