<p>The United States, which has the highest rate among rich nations of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, should launch a bold national campaign to combat the problem, a report released Tuesday said.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences said the United States lacked an effective system to prevent the diseases and called for a nationwide campaign aimed specifically at adolescents.</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and chlamydia kill thousands of people every year and accounted for five of the 10 most common diseases reported to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last year, even though all of them are preventable.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to fight this hidden epidemic by bringing together entire communities to promote healthy sexual behaviours, protect adolescents, provide high-quality clinical services and energise strong leadership in the fight against STDs,&quot; said William Butler, chancellor of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who chaired an Institute of Medicine panel that prepared the report for the academy.</p>
<p>Sexually transmitted diseases are often symptomless but can lead to mild acute illnesses such as pelvic pain as well as cervix and liver cancer and ectopic pregnancy. Twelve million new cases are diagnosed each year but the public sector spends only $1 to prevent and fight STDs for every $43 spent on treatment and other costs, the report said.</p>
<p>It called for private organisations and clinicians to step up involvement in a nationwide campaign -- targeted specifically at adolescents -- to prevent STDs, since the public sector was hampered by resource constraints.</p>
<p>Adolescents were at greater risk because they were more likely than adults to engage in unprotected sex and other high-risk sexual behaviour, it said. By 12th grade, nearly 70 percent of all adolescents had engaged in sexual intercourse and about one-fourth had had sex with four or more partners.</p>
<p>The report said the CDC should take the lead in improving the surveillance of such diseases and collaborate with state and local agencies to monitor the effectiveness of prevention programmes. In addition, an independent national roundtable should be created to develop and implement a comprehensive system of STD-related services throughout the country.</p>
<p>Schools should provide information on preventing STDs, hand out condoms and provide clinical services to prevent, diagnose and treat the diseases once they occur.</p>
<p>The report recommended that television, radio, print and other media accept advertisements and public messages that encourage the use of condoms and other means to protect against STDs and teen pregnancy, including delaying sexual intercourse.</p>
