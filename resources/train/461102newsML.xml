<p>Shanghai's B share index continued its correction in slow trade on Friday with domestic investors staying on the sidelines on uncertainty, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index fell 0.346 points or 0.5 percent to 68.996 points on volume of 4.45 million shares worth $2.26 million against $2.1 million on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The A share index rebounded after corrections on Thursday, gaining 18.05 points or 1.54 percent to 1190.936 points on turnover of 3.6 billion yuan compared with 3.8 billion yuan during the Thursday morning session.  </p>
<p>Brokers said most investors had no interest in building positions, and selling on concerns about poor company results pushed the index down.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors have dominated recent trading and now that they are not buying the market is coming down,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;The index is likely to find technical support at the 68-point level in the short term but most company results are expected to be poor, which will push the index down further,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>Of 43 B shares, 40 traded with 19 down, 10 flat and 11 up.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Post &amp; Telecommunications Equipment was the worst performer on speculative selling, falling $0.018 or 3.87 percent to $0.446 on volume of 19,000 shares.</p>
<p>Real estate developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Zone Development traded the most on liquidation amid expectations of poor results despite institutional support.</p>
<p>It fell $0.012 or 1.27 percent to $0.928 on volume of 585,500 shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A shares rose on a technical rebound after sharp losses on Thurday helped by institutional buying in selective stocks, brokers said.</p>
