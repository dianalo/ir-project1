<title>UK: Manufacturing output fell in August.</title>

<p>Manufacturing output fell unexpectedly in August, the government reported Monday, casting fresh doubt on the strength of Britain's economic recovery.</p>
<p>Manufacturing output fell 0.3 percent in August from July and stood 0.9 percent below its level in August 1995, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists had forecast a 0.4 percent increase in output.</p>
<p>&quot;We had thought ... we would begin to see the benefit of strong consumer spending cutting through to manufacturing output,&quot; said Stephen Hannah, head of research at IBJ International. &quot;It hasn't happened, the sector still looks quite weak.&quot;</p>
<p>Industrial production including the energy industry also fell in August, down 0.4 percent, the office said.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to Monday's data, recent surveys from the Confederation of British Industry and Chartered Institute of Purchasing Supply have painted a picture of a stronger economy.</p>
<p>The Treasury pointed to the survey evidence and said the drop in manufacturing output in August followed a healthy 0.6 percent rise in July. That added up to a manufacturing sector &quot;on the up,&quot; one Treasury official said.</p>
<p>But economists said Monday's data cast doubt on the ability of British manufacturers' to cope with weak demand in Europe and mountains of unsold stocks, produced a year or more ago when prospects looked brighter.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics said the trend in manufacturing was basically flat.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent surveys have suggested a turnaround in this sector but so far they have proved rather wide of the mark,&quot; said Andrew Milligan, economist at General Accident.</p>
<p>He said one month's figures did not require drastic action in terms of fiscal or monetary policy. &quot;But such data will certainly help the Chancellor resist any pressure for base rate increases in the autumn.&quot;</p>
<p>A run of strong economic data in recent weeks, showing consumers spending fast, had prompted many economists to call for an early tightening of monetary policy to choke off inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>But Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke also will come under intense from his colleagues in the ruling Conservative Party to cut interest rates and taxes ahead  of elections that must be held by May 1997.</p>
<p>While other parts of the economy may be showing strength, manufacturing output will lag behind until producers work off stocks of unsold goods, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although demand is strengthening, firms are still able to meet if off the shelves, rather than stepping up new production,&quot; said Jonathan Loynes, economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>He also said fresh strength in the pound, up 4 percent on a trade-weighted basis in two months, posed further dangers to a manufacturing recovery that has barely begun.</p>
<p>&quot;Export markets are crucial for the manufacturing sector and a further loss of competitiveness for U.K. firms, due to a further appreciation of the pound, could stifle any manufacturing recover before it really begins,&quot; he said.</p>
