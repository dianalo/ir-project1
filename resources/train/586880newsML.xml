<title>GERMANY: German right-winger charged with shooting policeman.</title>
<headline>German right-winger charged with shooting policeman.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG, Germany 1997-05-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>German prosecutors on Thursday charged a 24-year-old right-wing extremist with the murder of a policeman and other counts of attempted murder.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the extremist had admitted shooting dead one police officer and wounding a second during a routine traffic inspection in February, but said he acted in &quot;self-defence against the state&quot;.</p>
<p>The man has also confessed to shooting a Berlin book dealer to punish east German communists, saying he was angry at the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) for disrupting a far-right rally in Berlin on February 15.</p>
<p>The PDS operates an office in the same building as the shopkeeper, who was seriously wounded.</p>
<p>The man was captured after a chase and shootout with police on a motorway east of Hamburg.</p>
<p>Berlin's anti-extremist office for the protection of the constitution warned in a recent report that right-wing militants might resort to violence in the future.</p>
