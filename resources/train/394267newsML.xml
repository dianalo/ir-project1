<p>Canadian spot natural gas prices were mostly softer again Friday, dragged down by continuing mild temperatures and ample storage supplies in the East, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Canadian Gas Association (CGA) said earlier today that total gas stocks as of Feb 14 were at 132.54 billion cubic feet (bcf), or 26.96 percent full, as compared with 25.5 percent of capacity a year ago.</p>
<p>At the AECO storage hub, prices fell by 12 cents to an average range of C$1.26-1.31 per gigajoule (GJ), indicating a drop of 14 cents from week-ago levels.</p>
<p>Early deals at AECO for the weekend were reported done as low as C$1.25 as NOVA packed gas onto the system and forecasters called for a continuation of mild weather in western Canada through Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, some late buying of storage supplies pushed prices to as high as C$1.35, sources said.</p>
<p>Both March and July/August AECO prices were talked in the C$1.34-1.36 per GJ range, sources said.</p>
<p>In the West, CGA data showed stocks were at 73.73 bcf, or 28.45 percent of capacity. A year ago storage was 34.3 percent full.</p>
<p>At Sumas, Wash., prices lost another 10 cents to the low-teens, with deals reported done anywhere from $1.05 to $1.16 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).</p>
<p>Sources blamed the downward spiral in this week's prices on milder weather and plentiful hydroelectric supplies in the Northwest.</p>
<p>In the East, Niagara prices drifted five cents lower into the $2.11-2.16 per mmBtu range.</p>
<p>CGA said today that gas in storage in the East as of Feb 14 was at 58.81 bcf, or 25.29 percent full. These data compare with year-ago tallies at 15.8 percent of capacity.</p>
