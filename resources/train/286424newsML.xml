<text>
<p>French government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said on Friday that the current level of official interest rates in France was not an obstacle to economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;All experts are agreed that it is not the level of interest rates which is slowing economic growth,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>He said that 15 months ago, high interest rates had been the principal handicap to economic recovery. But the Bank of France had since cut rates and this was no longer the case today.</p>
<p>Lamassoure, also budget minister, had been asked whether he thought that the Bank of France had room to cut short-term official French interest rates below those of Germany.  </p>
<p>He noted that long-term French interest rates had regularly dipped below German long-term rates.</p>
<p>He said there had been &quot;convergent action&quot; between the policies of the Bank of France and the government.</p>
<p>While the government had worked to improve public finances, the Bank of France, which alone was responsible for monetary policy, had eased interest rates, he said.</p>
