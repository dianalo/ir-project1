<p>The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, is likely to pass a 15 percent profit tax on government securities operations and interest on household deposits in banks, Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This will increase the revenue part of the budget and the Duma has a great appetite for spending,&quot; Yasin told a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Yasin said the government no longer needed tax exemptions on government securitities operations introduced at the start of trade in 1993 to attract buyers.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said on Tuesday that the proposed tax may not make it through parliament, as there were many opponents to the draft.</p>
<p>Central bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said last week that the bank would oppose the tax and if levied it would lead to a rise in the yield necessary to raise resources for the government.</p>
<p>At Wednesday's auction of six-month discount GKO Treasury bills the average yield fell to 61.25 percent, and the government says it wants yields to fall to 25-50 percent this year. In the run-up to the June/July presidential election they topped 200 percent.</p>
