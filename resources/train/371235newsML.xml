<p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman warned on Monday the United States could not let European wheat export subsidies &quot;go on forever&quot; but immediate use of U.S. export subsidies was not imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;If we think our producers need it to survive and be competitive, then we'll use it,&quot; Glickman said, referring to the Export Enhancement Programme, the main U.S. export subsidy programme.</p>
<p>Grain trade sources said there were no signs of Agriculture Department preparations to use export subsidies. One of them said Glickman's trans-Atlantic threats were aimed at deterring the European Union from offering overly generous subsidies on its wheat.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see anything before the new crop (is harvested),&quot; the grain trade source said. &quot;The absolutely earliest would be August or September.&quot;</p>
<p>Glickman made the comments on export subsidies during a briefing on an upcoming trip to South Africa. Earlier in the day, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Bob Smith, an Oregon Republican, supported activation of the EEP subsidies to maintain U.S. market share in the face of falling wheat and barley prices.</p>
<p>The United States has not subsidised grain exports since July 1995. Congress limited EEP to $100 million in fiscal 1997, which opened last Oct. 1, because of high global prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I see the Europeans have continued to use some export subsidies in their sales of wheat. We can't let that go on forever without some kind of response,&quot; Glickman told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not said that we have any imminent plans to announce activation of EEP for any particular country but I do believe that it would be extremely imprudent not to adequately fund EEP,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In his proposed budget for fiscal 1998, President Bill Clinton asked for $500 million for EEP, the maximum allowed under world trade rules.</p>
<p>The grain trade sources said there was no swell of demand for U.S. export subsidies. One of them said there could be pressure to use EEP in the next few months as a way to justify earmarking the $500 million for fiscal 1998 even though the United States does not want to start a subsidy war.</p>
<p>U.S. wheat exports have been forecast for a comparatively small 950 million bushels, or 25.86 million metric tons, this marketing year, a reflection of large crops in other exporting nations, including much of Europe, and constrained U.S. output.</p>
<p>Chris Goldthwait, the Agriculture Department sales manager, said there were no plans to use EEP in the near term.</p>
