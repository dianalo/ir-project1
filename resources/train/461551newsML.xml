<p>Three policemen were killed and two others were seriously injured when their armoured personnel carrier was hit by an explosion in the southern Russian republic of North Ossetia, a local Interior Ministry spokesman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;According to preliminary information, the blast appears to have been caused by an anti-tank mine,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred on Friday afternoon near the border with another Russian republic, Ingushetia. Both republics are located next to breakaway Chechnya, where rebel guerrillas successfully waged a 21-month war against Russian troops.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the policemen had been on their way to help another police vehicle which had hit a mine in the area. There were no casualties in the earlier incident.</p>
<p>&quot;As spring comes and the snow melts we fear there may be more accidents like this,&quot; the spokesman added.</p>
<p>The North Ossetian Interior Ministry wants Russian troops to help clear mines in the area, he said.</p>
<p>Peace has returned to Chechnya following an accord signed between the rebels and Moscow last summer but the region remains awash with weapons, ammunition and mines.</p>
