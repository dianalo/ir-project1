<title>UK: IPE Brent firms on Iraq, Nigeria, technicals.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent firms on Iraq, Nigeria, technicals.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures stabilised at higher levels after a combination of technical buying and fundamental news from Iraq and Nigeria pushed numbers up in the morning session, traders said.</p>
<p>June Brent was 22 cents a barrel firmer at 1157 GMT and stood at $18.56 while May gas oil was $1.25 firmer at $166.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;The news from Nigeria and Iraq has not really had an awful lot of effect,&quot; one IPE dealer said.</p>
<p>Iraq's official news agency INA said on Tuesday a number of helicopters was sent to the border area to pick up pilgrims. The U.S. said on Monday it would &quot;respond appropriately&quot; to any such flights.</p>
<p>&quot;The Iraqi story took it up to a bit of a peak,&quot; a broker said. &quot;But it seems to be just a bit of sabre rattling on the part of Iraq and the U.S. It is unlikely they are going to blow pilgrims out of the sky.&quot;</p>
<p>Some traders in the physical markets were offhand about Shell Nigeria's declaration of force majeure on Nigeria's 450-475,000 barrels per day (bpd) exports of Bonny crude oil with effect from Monday because of a strike by contractors at the tanker terminal.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of thing (the strike) is normal, very normal,&quot; one said, but added that the declaration of force majeure was unusual.</p>
<p>A broker at the IPE echoed the sentiment. &quot;The comment about it being 'very normal' summed that situation up very well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said they saw resistance firstly at $18.62 a barrel, the bottom of a chart gap from earlier in the month, then at $18.77, the top of the same chart gap.</p>
<p>Dealers were also aware that U.S. markets could later exert a strong influence in London, given that the May NYMEX crude oil futures contract expires on Tuesday.</p>
