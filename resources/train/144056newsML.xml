<p>Protesters hit Toronto streets on Friday, paralyzing rush-hour subway trains and closing businesses in Canada's biggest city to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.</p>
<p>Underground subway and bus service ground to a halt in this city of 2.2 million people, forcing about one million commuters to walk, drive or cycle to work or stay home.</p>
<p>&quot;They're picketing all over the place, so we've postponed service,&quot; Marilyn Bolton, a spokesperson for the Toronto Transit Commission said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Unionized workers, civil servants and social activists also descended on government offices and factories on this first day of the so-called &quot;Days of Protest.&quot;</p>
<p>But picketers failed to disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest airport.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange had expected protesters to disrupt trading, but Canada's biggest stock market opened as usual.</p>
<p>At least one brokerage firm flew traders to its Montreal office to work today, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.</p>
<p>The stock exchange has been targeted for a major rally later today.</p>
<p>The protesters are furious with Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labor laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.</p>
<p>&quot;These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarization that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,&quot; Sid Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.</p>
<p>But Harris, who has been dubbed &quot;Newt of the North&quot; in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his &quot;Common Sense Revolution.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the opposition to his government, the Conservatives' popularity continues to hold around 50 percent in opinion polls.</p>
<p>Protesters waved placards and temporarily blocked cars from entering government parking lots, but Toronto police said there were no major incidents of violence.</p>
<p>One man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening pickets with a baseball bat outside a bus garage. There also were skirmishes outside a postal station.</p>
<p>Many commuters took the delays in stride.</p>
<p>&quot;I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,&quot; said John Ivarey.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several major manufacturers canceled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm  Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant will be off the job Friday.</p>
<p>The protest will not affect General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, which is getting back to work after a nearly three-week strike ended earlier this week.</p>
