<title>UK: Mark crosses firmer but off highs in Europe.</title>
<headline>Mark crosses firmer but off highs in Europe.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The mark was slightly firmer on its crosses in afternoon Europe but still shy of session highs as the recent bout of optimism over Europe's single currency was pared back slightly.</p>
<p>The dollar/mark retreat from earlier highs also provided the mark with some support but dealers said the dollar's tone still remained strong and seemed likely to keep the mark's gains on its crosses to a minimum in the near term.</p>
<p>Dealers said the main European focus was the lira, which gave up some of Monday's gains on the mark as EMU and Italian inflation optimism were overshadowed by fresh political worries.  </p>
<p>Italian bonds, already softened by profit-taking on recent gains, slipped lower in afternoon trade after news that Italy's Freedom Alliance party intends to vote against a government motion on sending an Italian-led multinational force to Albania.</p>
<p>Italy's parliament votes today and Wednesday on the Albanian deployment and a government loss on its own motion could put strong pressure on Prime Minister Romano Prodi to resign.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the nervousness over this has already come out,&quot; said Lee Ferridge, currency strategist at Commerzbank in London. &quot;I can't see the government falling over this issue, it may prove to be another storm-in-a-teacup scenario.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mark/lira was trading at 987.35/65 at 1359 GMT, off an earlier peak of 989.10 lire just shy of its central ERM rate of 990 lire. It stood at 984.20 lire in late Monday trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said the lira's reaction to this latest round of Italian political volatility was relatively muted and that damage to EMU optimism has been limited.</p>
<p>&quot;The country as a whole is committed to EMU. If there is a change in prime minister, I can't see a big change in overall policy.&quot;</p>
<p>EMU optimism was given a slight boost in late trade from comments by Bundesbank council member Guntram Palm.  </p>
<p>Palm said he believed the chances for a timely start to EMU were better than ever following this weekend's Ecofin meeting in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&quot;Those comments underline the current EMU optimism but they're not surprising given that Palm is one of the more pro-euro leaning Bundesbank members,&quot; said a Japanese bank dealer.</p>
<p>A drop in German March unemployment data caused little surpise, coming largely in line with analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>The unadjusted March jobless figure stood at 4.477 million, a rate of 11.7 percent against February's 12.2 percent. Seasonally adjusted unemployment shrank 15,000 to 4.3 million.  </p>
<p>The peseta was slightly softer from Monday's levels, trading at 84.47/49 per mark against 84.45.</p>
<p>Spanish Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said earlier today Spanish GDP should grow about three percent in the first half of 1997 while March CPI, due Friday, and in coming months will be &quot;good&quot;.</p>
<p>Mark/French franc was mostly steady, trading near session lows at 3.3645/50 in late Europe compared with 3.3645 francs late Monday.</p>
