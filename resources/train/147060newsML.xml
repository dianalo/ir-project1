<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The freight market took a breather on Monday, with the BFI reflecting the quieter situation with a fairly modest rise by recent standards of 12 points to 1268.</p>
<p>Although there was no evidence of any striking advances in rates reported in the morning, owners still remained optimistic, in particular about Panamax prospects in most areas, Capers in the Pacific and handies in the US.</p>
<p>Brokers noted a reluctance by owners to fix tonnage from the west to the Far East where their vessels' completion of discharge might coincide with annual holidays and deliveries of newbuildings from shipyards scheduled for early 1997.</p>
<p>GRAIN</p>
<p>October has been a difficult month for charterers in the North Atlantic but the pressure for tonnage to shift the larger stems has been relieved to some extent by the intervention of Capers. Another one of these, following M N Istanbul last week, was reported taken by Toepfer for two consecutives from November for 89,700 lights Mississippi/Holland at $10.50 and $11.00, rumoured to be Finix 123,125 dwt.</p>
<p>Toepfer were also linked with the Panamax Konavle for 55,000 hss USA Gulf/Poland for Nov 7/15 at $14.00 and 44,000 grains 55' US Gulf/Spain for Oct/Nov at $16.00. None of these rates was considered especially firm by brokers and it was said that the main chartering interest for panamaxes was now for mid-end November.</p>
<p>New enquiry was oted by Toepfer 50,000/10 hss US Gulf/El Dekheila for Nov 6/15, Transfield 50,000 hss or Ferts US Gulf/China for Nov 10/20, and Iranian charterers 100,000/10 wheat Canada/Iran for any November. Iranians also quoted 50,000 corn Argentina/Iran for Nov 8/14, Shipmair have an order for a Panamax delivery Recalada Nov 14/20 trip Gibraltar-Skaw, and Cargill 25-50,000 barley Rostock and La Pallice/Saudia Arabia for Nov 5/15. New interest in Handies included Dreyfus with 25,000 sbm pellets Plate/Dmark for Nov 5/15 and Cargill 1/14m cft South Brazil/Lisbon-Hamburg range Nov 15/Dec 15.</p>
<p>MINERALS</p>
<p>The caper market was regarded by brokers as potentially stronger in the Far East and also with some prospects of improvement in the Atlantic following the removal of a number of units to cover grain business. Market observers were keen to discover the rate fixed by Eden 138,000 dwt, rumoured fixed delivery China for a Pacific round. In addition to fixing Pacific Challenger for 120,000 co Newcastle to Kaohsiung for mid Dec at $6.00, China Steel were believed to have taken another BHP-relet, possibly Iron Whyalla, for similar business although some suspected the loading port might be Dalrymple Bay.</p>
<p>Nordmoritz 72,500 dwt was said to have been booked on subjects by Navix delivery Taiwan early November for an East Australian coal cargo to Japan at between $10,200 and $10,500 daily. In the Atlantic a firm coal fixture was concluded by Cobelfret with Maja Vestida 70,213 dwt delivery retro sailing Continent for a round trip via Maracaibo at $10,000 daily.</p>
<p>Transfield were linked with Giovanni Bottiglieri 75,265 dwt delivery Continent prompt for a trip via US Gulf to China at about $13,000 daily and possibly also with Darya Geeth 73,119 dwt for similar trip at an unknown rate. From South Africa coal procurement were reported to have fixed 35,000 tonnes coal Durban/Continent at a weak $9.00.</p>
<p>HANDY-SIZES</p>
<p>An exceptionally firm rate was reported conceded by Sanko for haa Neptune 44,820 dwt delivery Baltimore early Nov trip via US Gulf to the Far East at $10,500 daily plus $200,000 bonus. Charterers in this are are struggling to find suitable tonnage.</p>
<p>Rondeau were variously rumoured to have covered Mary F 43,530 dwt for 5-7 months at $7,950 dwt or 4-6 months at $8,200 daily, but delivery area was uncertain. Brokers reported conditions a little firmer for geared tonnage in the Far East and North Pacific.</p>
<p>Kapitan Betkher 36,663 dwt achieved a level of $7,500 day from Showa for an early Nov coal trip from Indonesia to Japan, last fixed having been Dona V 33,000 dwt at $6,250 daily a week ago. Pan Ocean took a 1997-built 27,000 dwt vessel delivery West Australia mid Nov for a trip to South Korea at $5,300 daily plus $55,000 bonus.</p>
