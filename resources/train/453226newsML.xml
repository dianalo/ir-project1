<p>MGE spring wheat futures settled higher after late fund buying gripped the market, and traders said the market was also assisted by ongoing concern about possible flooding in the northern Plains.</p>
<p>&quot;We were totally dead until the close... and that's when we saw what sure as heck looked like fund buying in our pit,&quot; a MGE trader said.</p>
<p>MGE spring wheat settled 4-3/4 to seven cents per bushel higher, with nearby March expiring at $4.25, up seven cents on teh day. May closed up 5-1/2 cents at $4.07-1/4 and new crop September gained 6-1/2 cents to close at $3.91.</p>
<p>Wheat also drew spillover support from a late rally in CBOT soybean and soymeal futures.</p>
<p>Wheat had been mixed at the midsession, with nearby contracts weak after an unexpectedly high number of railcars were received Wednesday on the Minneapolis cash trading floor.</p>
<p>Traders said Atwood-Peavey was an early bear-spreader of around 500,000 May/July bushels at 13-1/2 cents. Wilson Trading was said to have been on the other side of that.</p>
<p>MGE barley futures did not trade, although the May contract was bid 10 cents per cwt higher at $6.80.</p>
