<title>ITALY: Fiat chief Romiti sentenced to 18 months.</title>
<headline>Fiat chief Romiti sentenced to 18 months.</headline>
<dateline>TURIN, Italy</dateline>

<p>Cesare Romiti, chairman of Italian carmaker and industrial group Fiat, was sentenced to 18 months in prison by an Italian judge Wednesday for false accounting, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>However, this is only the first round in the Italian judicial process and there are further opportunities for Romiti to appeal. Under Italian law, sentences of under two years are usually suspended.</p>
<p>Presiding judge Francesco Saluzzo also gave Fiat finance director Francesco Paolo Mattioli a 16-month sentence for similar charges at the trial, which was conducted behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The main prosecutor Giangiacomo Sandrelli had asked for a 20-month sentence for Romiti and eight months for Mattioli.</p>
<p>The trial opened in Fiat's home city of Turin in northwest Italy in January when Romiti and Mattioli were charged with accounting fraud and making illegal payments to politicans and managers working overseas.</p>
<p>Saluzzo has asked for the transfer of documents to the prosecutor to evaluate the responsibility of Gianni Agnelli and other members of Fiat's executive committee. Agnelli was Fiat chairman for 30 years until he stepped down in March 1996.</p>
<p>At the start of the trial, the two top executives of Italy's largest private industrial company were accused of diverting more than 30 billion lire ($17.6 million) into overseas accounts from the 1980s. Prosecutors alleged the funds were used to make payments to political parties, politicans and Fiat managers abroad.</p>
<p>Romiti took over as chairman of Fiat last year when Gianni Agnelli turned 75. Romiti began a successful partnership with Agnelli in the mid-1970s and as managing director was his right-hand man as Fiat took tough measures to reshape and restructure in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
