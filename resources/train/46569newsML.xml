<headline>U.S. court denies request for rehearing on Lloyd's.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A U.S. appeals court denied a request by a group of 93 investors in Lloyd's of London for a rehearing of a decision that allowed the British insurance giant to proceed with its reorganization.</p>
<p>The U.S. appeals court in Baltimore in August threw out an injunction issued by a U.S. district judge that Lloyd's said could have led to its collapse.</p>
<p>Investors in Lloyd's, known as Names, were being asked to pay up to $150,000 each to help fund a new company called Equitas that would take responsibility for $12.4 billion in Lloyd's losses.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Names argued that they had not been given adequate financial information and claimed that Lloyd's had violated U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert Payne in Richmond, Va., agreed with the Names and ruled they would suffer irreparable harm if the preliminary injunction were denied.</p>
<p>The appeals court lifted the injunction and now denied the motion for a rehearing.</p>
<p>&quot;We were disappointed the court was unwilling to give further consideration of the matter,&quot; said Susan Cahoon, a partner with Atlanta, Ga., law firm Kilpatrick &amp; Cody, which represented the Names.</p>
<p>She said there has been no decision about any possible further action.</p>
