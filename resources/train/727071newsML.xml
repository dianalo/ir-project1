<p>House sales in London's Docklands area doubled last year, the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) said on Monday.</p>
<p>The LDDC, a quasi-governmentak body which oversees the development of the former docks to the east of the city's financial district, said more than 2,200 homes were sold during 1996/97, the highest level since 1988. It said 1,771 homes were built during the period.</p>
<p>&quot;The last year saw every area of activity move up a gear. Confidence is high and there is a great sense of optimism for the future,&quot; Sir Michael Pickard, LDDC's chairman said in its annual report.</p>
<p>Pickard said prospects for the areas looked good, with 3,800 jobs attracted to the area and 1.16 million square feet of office space let over the period. This compared with 1.37 million square feet the previous year and a million square feet the year before.</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of the area is now occupied.</p>
<p>He said the government's decision to go ahead with the millennium festival in Greenwich and the opening of the Jubilee underground railway line extension in 1998 would &quot;secure the long term future for the people who live and work in Docklands&quot;.</p>
<p>The Jubilee line extension will link Docklands to both the south of London and the west of the city.</p>
<p>The LDDC, which has less than a year of its mandate left to run, said that over the next 18 months work would start on nearly 1.0 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) worth of new development.</p>
<p>This will include a hotel, residential and leisure scheme, the new Citibank headquarters, an urban village, a university campus and a new secondary school, it added. ($ = 0.591 British Pounds)</p>
