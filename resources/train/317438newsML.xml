<p>The government has initiated an inquiry into Malaysia Airline System Bhd (MAS) after reports that the state carrier's service has deteriorated due to lack of staff, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Malay-language Berita Harian newspaper reported on Saturday that shortage of pilots and cabin crew members was affecting MAS service. Anwar told a news conference that he had asked the transport ministry to conduct an inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's get the report from the transport minister first,&quot; Anwar was quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency in response to questions on how the government would react to the problem.</p>
<p>Bernama said Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik had acknowledged the Berita Harian report, saying he had heard of such complaints.</p>
<p>It quoted Ling as saying that his ministry would meet MAS officials to investigate the matter and find a solution.</p>
<p>Parliamentary opposition leader Lim Kit Siang said a review of salaries and working conditions of MAS pilots and other cabin crew should be carried out at once.</p>
<p>&quot;The services of MAS has definitely deteriorated in the past year and more, with many flight delays as well as unsatisfactory handling of customer inquiries and complaints,&quot; Lim said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said MAS should also give priority to modifying the rudder system of its Boeing 737 aircraft, as advised by U.S. Federal Aviation authorities on Wednesday, to prevent inadvertent rudder movement which could throw the plane out of control.</p>
