<p>Israeli soldiers firing rubber-coated metal bullets wounded at least 29 Palestinians in renewed clashes on Wednesday in the divided West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Arab youths, sweeping past unarmed Palestinian police, raced from a funeral procession for one of three Arabs killed a day earlier in Hebron to hurl rocks and petrol bombs at the troops who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.</p>
<p>There was little sign of progress on the diplomatic front to revive peace moves that came to a halt last month over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's green light for bulldozers to begin work on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;What you are seeing today and every day is a result of Netanyahu's stupid provocation at Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; a Palestinian said in Hebron, referring to the housing project, as gunshots echoed in alleyways packed with angry youths.</p>
<p>The street battles flared a day after the heaviest bloodshed in the West Bank since the crisis began.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as there is terror, as long as there are threats and violence from the side of the Palestinians, it is impossible to continue the political process,&quot; Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak told Israel Television.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, just back from talks in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton, insisted on Tuesday that peace could still be salvaged.</p>
<p>A Palestinian delegation planned to travel to Washington on Wednesday for talks with U.S. officials on launching an American peace initiative, PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat said. He will be accompanied by chief Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen.</p>
<p>Palestinians had hoped Clinton would pressure Netanyahu to stop construction of 6,500 homes for Jews in East Jerusalem which the PLO said completes a ring of settlements aimed at pre-empting talks on the future of that half of the city.</p>
<p>&quot;Clinton asked Netanyahu to freeze settlement building. Netanyahu said he would not,&quot; a U.S. diplomat, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Marwan Kanafani, a spokesman for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, rejected any notion the PLO would accept a deal that did not include stopping work at the East Jerusalem site Israel calls Har Homa.</p>
<p>&quot;I would discard this report. We are not going to compromise on settlement activities,&quot; Kanafani said in Gaza.</p>
<p>Chanting their support for an assassinated Hamas bombmaker, an angry Arab crowd in Hebron shouted &quot;Yahya Ayyash, you are dead but we continue your path&quot; in a funeral procession for Nader Saeed, 25, one of those killed on Tuesday in the town.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources said police had released on bail two Jewish settlers who shot dead a Palestinian in Hebron on Tuesday and banned them from entering the town. The settlers said they acted in self-defence. Palestinians called the shooting unprovoked. The other two Palestinians who died on Wednesday were killed in clashes with Israeli troops.</p>
<p>In cat-and-mouse clashes on Wednesday, Israeli soldiers were able to keep out of harm's way by perching on rooftops of Jewish settlement enclaves that remain in Hebron under an interim peace deal. Some fired rubber bullets at the crowds below.</p>
<p>Several Arab youths climbed on top of buildings and used slingshots to try to hit Israeli snipers. Protesters hooted, as if they were at a football match, when a stone found its mark.</p>
<p>Hebron hospital said 29 Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets, one in the head. Israel's army radio said three Israeli soldiers and two Palestinian policemen were injured by stones.</p>
<p>More than an hour into the violence, three Palestinian police jeeps drove in reverse along a main street, forcing demonstrators to retreat out of stone-throwing range.</p>
