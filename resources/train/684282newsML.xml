<p>German inflation appeared to be held in check on Tuesday as the first three states that make up the preliminary June west German price report showed consumer prices climbing exactly as most experts expected.</p>
<p>Economists said sluggish economic growth and weak consumer demand kept a lid on inflation this month and they expected prices to remain stable for at least the rest of the year.</p>
<p>All three of the states to release data so far, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, have reported monthly cost of living increases of 0.2 percent in June, in each case lower than or the same as the monthly increase in May.</p>
<p>Compared with June 1996, the cost of living climbed 1.4 percent in Baden-Wuerttemberg, 1.6 percent in Bavaria and 1.9 percent in North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>
<p>&quot;Its right in line with expectations,&quot; said Adolf Rosenstock, economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan. &quot;The uptick in yearly inflation should not be mistaken as a sign of higher underlying inflation. It is due to underlying reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>He and other economists said the data suggested the upcoming preliminary west Germany report will show a 0.2 percent increase from May and 1.6 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Last month, the west German cost of living rose 1.5 percent year-on-year and posted a sharp 0.4 percent jump on the month.</p>
<p>The last state that makes up the preliminary report, Hesse, is expected to release its CPI data on Wednesday, while the preliminary report is likely to be released shortly after the Hesse data.</p>
<p>Financial markets confirmed there was little to fear in the inflation figures, remaining largely unmoved by the data.</p>
<p>&quot;As we can see from the year-on-year rate, it continues to fluctuate around the 1.5 percent level, so there is no underlying inflation pressure,&quot; said Holger Schmieding, economist at Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Analysts said that volatile factors were responsible for much of the gains such as in Baden-Wuerttemberg where heating oil prices climbed 6.8 percent from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest threat to higher inflation is coming from the weaker mark which tends to raise the price of imported goods, but economists said this presented only a faint inflationary risk.</p>
<p>In a separate report, the Federal Statistics Office said import prices climbed 0.5 percent in May from the month before and 2.8 percent from May 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Producer prices have been up from the very low levels seen last year. This is mainly related to the depreciation of the mark, which is feeding into prices,&quot; said Armin Kayser, economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;It could create an inflation hump over the next few months but it will not change the very favourable prospects for long-term price stability.&quot;</p>
