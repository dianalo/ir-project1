<p>The European Commission made clear this week that British Airways' proposed deal with American Airlines will now be shaped by whether British prime minister John Major wants another political battle with the European Union as he prepares to fight for re-election at home.</p>
<p>The two airlines had been hoping for Britain to approve their deal within the next few weeks, following months of investigation by trade minister Ian Lang and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).</p>
<p>But European Competition (EC) Commissioner Karel Van Miert threw down the gauntlet by attacking British proposals for approving the deal and challenging Major to either leave final judgement on the matter to the EC or face court action under European Union law.</p>
<p>Major maintained that London and not Brussels had right of way over vetting the deal under EU law.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be for Mr Lang to decide whether to clear the alliance,&quot; he told the British parliament on Thursday, to cheers from his minority government's supporters.</p>
<p>Lang made proposals for approving the deal last month which featured a core demand that BA release 168 weekly runway slots at London Heathrow -- enough to operate 12 daily return flights -- to make room for competitors.</p>
<p>But the proposals are currently being reviewed for Lang by the OFT following responses from airlines and other interested parties, including the European Commission and consumer bodies.</p>
<p>So industry sources say what happens next is now largely up to British trade minister.</p>
<p>If he decides to stick to his original proposals Van Miert says he will take the case to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Alternatively Lang could impose tougher terms which satisfy Van Miert and rival airlines.</p>
<p>Under the proposed alliance BA intends to coordinate its 244 flights a week to 22 U.S. destinations with American's 238 flights from seven U.S. airports to 12 European destinations.</p>
<p>BA and American argue that their deal will lead to greater competition because it will not go ahead unless Britain and the United States agree a bilateral open skies aviation trade pact to give all U.S. airlines access to London Heathrow, the most popular of Europe's transatlantic landfalls.</p>
<p>Under the current bilateral aviation treaty only four airlines are allowed to operate services out of Heathrow -- BA, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American -- and frequencies and routes are restricted.</p>
<p>But Van Miert and rival airlines say they have told the OFT more concessions need to be made if BA and American are to be prevented from dominating the British transatlantic market with over 60 percent of current capacity.</p>
<p>Van Miert told Reuters Television in an interview that he believes more slots need to be given up, they need to be at competitive times of the day and they should be surrendered rather than sold as British Airways says it wants to do.</p>
<p>&quot;Selling slots which had been given for free is certainly not a remedy to cure the competition concerns,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lang's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) contends that EU law neither endorses or bans the sale of runway slots and says it remains for Lang to decide in this instance whether BA should sell or surrender the slots he requires &quot;released.&quot;</p>
<p>BA says it should be allowed to get &quot;a fair value&quot; but because good slot times at Heathrow are so scarce rival airlines have estimated that BA could get over 1.5 million pounds apiece for every slot it has to give up.</p>
<p>In considering Van Miert's objections Lang might decide to put off making his own ruling until the Commission has pronounced on the deal under its wider investigation of European transatlantic alliances which is due for completion in April.</p>
<p>But industry sources say the risk for BA and American is that a political row in Europe could hold up the parallel U.S. approvals process and bilateral trade talks.</p>
<p>BA and American submitted their application requesting approval under U.S. anti-trust laws last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this row between Britain and the EC is going to make the (U.S.) departments of Justice and Transportation sit up and take notice,&quot; said one airline industry source.</p>
