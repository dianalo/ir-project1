<p>Russian aluminium foil maker Sayanal and Reynolds International of the United States plan to set up a joint venture to sell Russian-made foil to domestic and foreign users, a top company official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Reynolds will find orders for us,&quot; said Sayanal chief executive Oleg Deripaska, who also heads Sayansky Alyuminievy Zavod, Russia's third-largest aluminium producer.</p>
<p>The Sayansk factory has a controlling interest in Sayanal, a joint venture with Reynolds International (a Reynolds Metals Co unit) and Italy's Fata.</p>
<p>A copy of a document signed by officials from Sayanal and Reynolds said the two sides would work to improve quality to meet the needs of cigarette packagers in Russia and abroad.</p>
<p>The goal, the document said, is &quot;to develop... cigarette packaging technology which would meet the requirements of Philip Morris and other leader tobacco companies.&quot;</p>
<p>A Reynolds official in Moscow declined to comment.</p>
<p>Sayanal, which has a modern factory located on the southern Siberian steppe, does not yet make foil thin enough to meet cigarette packaging standards.</p>
<p>Deripaska said the joint venture would open eight offices across Russia to persuade Russian industrial consumers -- which annually import 50,000 tonnes of packaging materials, over half of them made of aluminium -- to buy some locally-made aluminium.</p>
<p>He said that while domestic demand for aluminium was soft, it held good long-term potential, especially among producers of chocolate, milk and other consumer goods.</p>
<p>&quot;We will (eventually) try to sell everything in Russia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sayanal plans to produce at least 3,000 tonnes per month of foil products, including packaging materials and household foil, by 2000, up from its current output of 500 tonnes a month.</p>
<p>Foil production at Sayanal would reach 1,400 tonnes per month by 1997, Deripaska said, adding, &quot;We need to compete with Western production.&quot;</p>
<p>He said domestic primary aluminium consumption was 250,000 tonnes in 1995 -- about half the 550,000 level reported for 1995 by the Russian State Metallurgy Committee.</p>
<p>A 1995 report commissioned by the International Primary Aluminium Institute said Russian domestic aluminium consumption fell from 2.76 million tonnes in 1989 to 657,000 tonnes in 1993.</p>
<p>Fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers in Russia have only recently begun to revamp their packaging to compete with Western imports.</p>
<p>While Moscow has seen a construction boom that producers say could spur demand for aluminium, overall demand is still far below levels seen in recent years.</p>
