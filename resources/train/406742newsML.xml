<p>Despite losing their giant winger Jonah Lomu for the entire season due to a kidney disorder, Auckland will still be the team to beat in this year's Super 12 competition.</p>
<p>The Auckland Blues, who thrashed European club champions Brive 47-11 at the weekend, meet Northern Transvaal in Pretoria on Saturday.</p>
<p>Queensland host Australian Capital Territory in Brisbane on the same day while the competition kicks off in Palmerston North on the previous day when Wellington take on Waikato.</p>
<p>Auckland remain the powerbase of New Zealand rugby, fielding 13 All Blacks in their squad when they defeated Natal comfortably in last year's Super 12 final.</p>
<p>Even without Lomu, they still have two other outstanding Polynesian wingers in Samoan international Brian Lima and the immensely promising Joeli Vidiri, who was a revelation for the New Zealand Barbarians against England at Twickenham last year.</p>
<p>&quot;They have tremendous strength in depth and they can attack you from all over the pitch,&quot; said Queensland coach John Connolly.</p>
<p>&quot;But I do believe it will be a very close competition. There are a lot of variables, such as injuries. It will be very tough.&quot;</p>
<p>The four South African sides -- Natal, Northern Transvaal, Transvaal and Free State -- have the advantage of starting their campaigns at home.</p>
<p>But domestic tensions off the field may undermine the South African efforts on the pitch.</p>
<p>Northern Transvaal began the year with a player revolt which saw coach John Williams replaced by the World Cup winning coach Kitch Christie.</p>
<p>Christie, though, has lost both of the first two friendly matches home and away to the Free State and his cancer, which necessitates regular chemo-therapy, will not allow him to travel with the team to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Transvaal are contemplating their first season in five without Francois Pienaar at the helm, have lost Springbok lock Philip Schutte to Western Province, international number eight Rudolf Straeuli to English club Bedford as well as full-back Gavin Lawless. Lawless, the leading points scorer in last year's Currie Cup, has moved to Natal.</p>
<p>Natal in turn have lost a host of internationals, including Springbok winger James Small to Western Province, French midfielder Thierry Lacroix to Harlequins and Argentine hooker Federico Mendez to Bath.</p>
<p>By contrast, Free State have lost no one and gained Eastern Province prop Willie Meyer.</p>
<p>New South Wales have strengthened this pack with Italian international lock Mark Giacheri and Queensland have also looked abroad by signing Ireland's Peter Clohessy at tight-head prop.</p>
