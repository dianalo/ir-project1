<p>--------------------MARKET COMMENT----------------------------</p>
<p>* Toronto stocks were expected to move up at the outset, but traders said gains may not last. * U.S. March housing starts fell 6.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.425 million.  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks were expected to post gains early on Wednesday in a follow-through from Tuesday's rally.</p>
<p>But traders were uncertain whether the rise would extend throughout the session.</p>
<p>&quot;They're going to open stronger just in a carry-over. But I don't think it's going to last very long,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>U.S. March housing starts fell 6.4 percent to an annual rate of 1.425 million, barely impacting on bonds. Canadian February manufacturers' shipments rose 0.6 percent, to C$35.21 billion seasonally adjusted from C$35.02 billion in January.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday, The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index soared 64.22 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 5743.55. Toronto stocks were led by the U.S. which managed an impressive rise after tame inflation data were released.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 135 points to 6587.16.</p>
<p>--- STOCKS TO WATCH ---</p>
<p>* Pacific Forest Products released a first quarter profit of C$0.28 per share versus C$0.05 in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>* Cominco Ltd's first quarter profit was C$0.24 a share against a profit of C$0.31 in the same period of 1996.</p>
