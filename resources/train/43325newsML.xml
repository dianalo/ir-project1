<headline>UK backs Peptide search for allergy vaccine.</headline>

<p>Prospects for a vaccine which could change the lives of millions who suffer from life-threatening allergies to insect stings and foods were boosted by a British government grant to Peptide Therapeutics Plc on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 450,000 pound grant, from the Department of Trade and Industry, is intended to help scientists at the fledgling biotechnology company in Cambridge to develop a unique innoculation which may prevent fatal reactions to some foods and insect stings.</p>
<p>Peptide said its active allergy vaccine has already proved successful in small-scale trials on patients with serious food allergies, which can kill victims within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Some estimates indicate around 7.5 million people in Europe, the USA and Japan are vulnerable to severe allergic reactions, and there are signs that the incidence of attacks is rising.</p>
<p>Peptide's finance director John Brown told Reuters the vaccine works by stopping the release of histamine, the key agent in allergic reactions, and its unique structure means &quot;it could be active in a whole range of allergies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In experiments so far on serious food allergies, all the patients had allergies to different foods and it worked in all of them,&quot; Brown said.</p>
<p>Peptide believes the vaccine, which is based on work carried out at Birmingham University, may also help tackle allergic forms of asthma and eczema as well as adverse reaction to drugs.</p>
<p>Brown said Peptide, which intends to license out its discoveries to other companies rather than go it alone, is &quot;in negotiations with several companies&quot; over the allergy vaccine, which could be available to doctors by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>Peptide said on Tuesday its first-half pretax loss widened slightly to 1.78 million pounds from 1.65 million a year earlier. Its shares closed down one pence at 204-1/2p.</p>
