<p>South Korea's Daewoo Corp, aiming to hit a small car stronghold held by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, said on Wednesday it would soon launch a small car in India and make the country a global manufacturing base.</p>
<p>Daewoo Motor (India) Ltd plans to invest $1 billion in India by 1998, Daewoo officials told reporters in New Delhi. Of that amount, $558 million has already been spent.</p>
<p>The company, which is 91.63 percent owned by Daewoo Corp, will launch small and upmarket cars during the 1997/98 (April-March) financial year, and sometime later a new vehicle for the rural market with European collaboration, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the models would be a small car that Daewoo is introducing in the world market and the Indian market simultaneously and will therefore be part of the international launch,&quot; managing director Shiv Awasthi told a news conference.</p>
<p>Daewoo Motor (India), earlier called DCM Daewoo Motors Ltd, sold 17,000 of its midsize 1,000cc Cielo model cars in India during 1996/97.</p>
<p>Asked if the upcoming new small car would compete with the 800cc model of Maruti Udyog Ltd, in which Japan's Suzuki and the Indian government each hold 50 percent, Awasthi said: &quot;We will not compete on the size. But definitely it will be competitive.&quot;</p>
<p>Suzuki, enjoying a headstart through its venture with the government, which was launched under socialist protection, controls more than 80 percent of India's small car market.</p>
<p>But it faces a challenge from major car manufacturers which entered India under an economic reform programme begun in 1991.</p>
<p>Suzuki has lobbied to increase its shareholding in the venture to expand its presence. However, Indian officials have so far not backed the move.</p>
<p>&quot;Our focus remains unchanged and we will soon be one of the biggest sourcing bases for Daewoo outside Korea,&quot; said S.H. Park, chairman of Daewoo Motor (India). &quot;Our company would produce one million cars within 10 years, half of which would be exported back to Daewoo's global demands,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new name for DCM Daewoo has been approved by the company's board. Shareholders are expected to also approve it later this month.</p>
<p>Daewoo launched its Indian venture with India's DCM Group, initially buying a stake owned by Japan's Toyota Motor Corp in an ailing truck venture.</p>
<p>The DCM Group currently holds 1.18 percent of the company and Toyota has a 0.44 percent stake. A further 6.75 percent is held by small shareholders.</p>
<p>Daewoo has an annual capacity to produce 72,000 finished cars and 300,000 engines, gearboxes and other components, Awasthi said.</p>
<p>Awasthi said Cielo had a market share of 30 percent in India's 1,000cc midsize car segment, in which world majors like Ford Motor Co, General Motors Corp and France's Peugeot SA also compete.</p>
<p>Daewoo Motor expects to produce 32,000 cars including its new models in 1997/98, up from 17,000 in 1996/97, when sales were around 10 billion rupees, Awasthi said. In 1995/96, sales were around six billion rupees. ($1 = 35.88 rupees)</p>
