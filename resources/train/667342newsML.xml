<headline>INSTANT VIEW -- U.S. May CPI up 0.1 pct.</headline>

<p>Following are comments from U.S. economists after the Labor Department reported the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.1 percent in May.</p>
<p>Minus food and energy items, the core CPI was up 0.2 percent. In April, CPI rose 0.1 percent, while the core was up 0.3 percent. Economists in a Reuters survey had expected a 0.2 percent increase in both the overall and core rates.</p>
<p>CHERLY KATZ, ECONOMIST, MERRILL LYNCH AND CO INC: &quot;The only surprise was that apparel prices did still rise. I think apparel prices will eventually fall.&quot;  </p>
<p>Katz was speaking on Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>DAVID SLOAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, CONSULTING FIRM I.D.E.A. INC: &quot;The May CPI is very much as expected and consistent with the low inflation picture.&quot;</p>
<p>KEVIN FLANAGAN, VICE PRESIDENT AND AN ECONOMIST, DEAN WITTER SECURITIES: &quot;The market may get some support from the fact that you have the lowest year-on-year core rate in 31 years. We're continuing to see signs of benign inflation and I think this will hold the (Federal Reserve) at bay.&quot;  </p>
<p>ROBERT BLAKE, ECONOMIST, CITICORP GLOBAL FINANCE N.A.: &quot;The CPI seemed to come in as we expected. The core was up 0.2 percent and overall was up 0.1 percent. Gasoline prices were down 4.1 percent and energy prices were down 2.4 percent. I don't think it will have much impact on (Treasury) market expectations because we have been living in a low-inflation world and this just paints more of the same picture.&quot;</p>
<p>GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, A.G. EDWARDS &amp; SONS INC: &quot;The inflation numbers are still very moderate, which is consistent with what we've been seeing in recent months.  </p>
<p>Thayer continued: &quot;It suggests the strong economy is not pushing up inflation yet ... It does assure that inflation is not picking up, but what the number does not assure is that it won't pick up sometime in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer the economy continues to operate with tight labor markets, the more the world economy recovers from a slowdown, there will be more inflation risk. But today's number shows that we're not really in an inflationary environment. I don't think this number is going to cause the Fed to raise rates. Inflation is still relatively benign and they can probably wait until later this year to do something.&quot;  </p>
<p>MICHAEL STRAUSS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SANWA SECURITIES (USA) CO: &quot;It's a very favorable report. A lot of it was built into the marketplace. In general, people were expecting low inflation numbers and we got a low inflation number.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the individual components did behave quite nicely. We got a tempering in the apparel price hike, which was expected. We got some pickup in food prices, which people expected, and that was more than offset by a big drop in energy prices.&quot;  </p>
<p>JAMES PADINHA, ECONOMIST, BRIEFING.COM: &quot;It was a really good report, we had housing costs come in below trend, we had medical costs come in at trend, and those are the two areas to worry about.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, no uptick (in inflation) here, although this is a little backward looking. The Fed is in this experiment waiting to see signs of inflation before tightening -- and there is certainly nothing in this report to indicate that.&quot;  </p>
<p>JOE ABATE, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES: &quot;We think it was not a surprise. It's exactly what we and the concensus were looking for. You had declines in energy prices, which were as expected caused primarily by gasoline among other things. Food prices were up about up about four tenths, which was generally in line with what peoples' expectations were going into the number.</p>
<p>&quot;So, I would say the overall CPI report was a neutral factor for the market. It just confirms what people were already expecting, given the PPI report last week.&quot;  </p>
<p>SALLY KLEINMAN, ECONOMIST, CHASE SECURITIES INC: &quot;The CPI is just more good news. There was really nothing in the report that is at all surprising. There's no inflation.&quot;</p>
