<p>The Malaysia-based firm Ariston Sdn Bhd said on Sunday it was committed to executing its $1.3-billion-port development project in Cambodia despite delays and &quot;problems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ariston would like to reiterate that despite problems encountered and delays it will remain committed to complete the project and honour its agreement with the Royal Cambodian Government,&quot; Ariston said in a statement from Kuala Lumpur. On Friday, Reuters obtained a letter from co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh to Ariston Chief Executive Officer Chen Lip Keong that said the company's leases for a resort and golf course and airport concession agreement were &quot;null and void.&quot;</p>
<p>The letter, dated February 26, said the September 16 agreements had not followed proper legal procedures and had taken on political overtones because they were signed only by a representative of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP).</p>
<p>Ranariddh, who heads the royalist FUNCINPEC party, and co-Premier Hun Sen of the CPP, formed an uneasy coalition after running against each other in national elections in 1993.</p>
<p>Investors have complained that feuds between the two leaders often hurt business, especially when high-profile deals turn political.</p>
<p>Ariston, however, said it remained optimistic about its projects in Cambodia and noted the voided contracts were only sub-packages of its overall $1.3-billion-project to develop the southern port city of Sihanoukville.</p>
<p>It said it had made a good faith effort to have the agreements signed by officials from FUNCINPEC, but that FUNCINPEC representatives had not responded in time to their requests.</p>
<p>Ariston said Ranariddh wanted the project to be completed and had sent a representative to inspect the work site last week. It called Ranarridh a &quot;dynamic leader who wants his country to develop and prosper.&quot;</p>
