<p>Spain's plan to revamp its digital television regime has deteriorated into a nasty dogfight involving the government and companies backing the nation's first digital platform, scheduled for launch on Thursday.</p>
<p>The conservative Popular Party government maintains that the new regime will serve exclusively to protect viewers' rights.</p>
<p>But the platform administrator, Canalsatellite, argues that the new norms will stifle free competition and favour a second competing platform, controlled by groups close to the government, which will be launched in several months.</p>
<p>The government has said that despite the battle of words the cabinet is set to approve the changes on Friday.</p>
<p>In general, digital television, which will be offered as pay television, will be broadcast via satellite to homes, which will require decoders to receive the channels.</p>
<p>In Spain -- where there is next to no cable competition -- digital television sales are expected to reach 100 billion pesetas ($720 million) in 2000.</p>
<p>But digital television requires expensive investment in broadcasting rights for films and sports events and for the purchase and distribution of the decoders.</p>
<p>Most controversial among the government's new measures is the stipulation that univeral decoders be used in order to ensure homes receive all the channels from the different platforms.</p>
<p>When this law takes effect, the decoders Canalsatellite has ordered &quot;could turn into scrap,&quot; a government source said.</p>
<p>Canalsatellite has ordered 10 billion pesetas worth of decoders from Philips Electronics NV and Sony Corp.</p>
<p>Clearly furious at the government's move, Canalsatellite has blasted the government's norms as unconstitutional and argued they infringe the European Community Treaty.</p>
<p>The accusations from Canalsatellite -- comprised of Promotora de Informaciones, S.A. (Prisa), Canal Plus and probably soon Antena 3 -- centre on the charge that the government is abusing its power to favour the second platform.</p>
<p>That platform is comprised of Telefonica de Espana, whose remaining state stake of 20.9 percent is currently being privatised, Radio and Television of Spain (RTVE), Mexican group Televisa and various regional channels and editorial groups.</p>
<p>Canalsatellite maintains that the adminstration's new-found haste in modifying the law &quot;lacks any reasonable explanation,&quot; given that months had passed without the government acting.</p>
<p>&quot;What the government demands, a universal decoder, simply doesn't exist,&quot; a Prisa spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Our decoders are compatible with other platforms and are the same ones that are used in France and in the Netherlands, with the authorisation of the respective governments and the European Union,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Canalsatellite has lodged an appeal with the cabinet and also plans to bring up the affair before the European Commission.</p>
<p>The issue was further complicated by the defection at the end of December of Antena 3, which holds the coveted rights to broadcasting Spanish league soccer matches from the Telefonica platform to the competing platform of Canalsatellite.</p>
<p>Independent experts maintain that a pay television project without the lucrative soccer broadcasting rights is senseless.</p>
<p>A government source acknowledged that the soccer interests were a decisive factor in the current debate over digital television, although he underlined that the Administration was not against the existence of two platforms.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he said that the project headed by Telefonica better represents Spanish interests that Canalsatellite's.</p>
<p>&quot;Telefonica's platform will broadcast through Hispasat, the Spanish satellite, while Canal Plus, which participates in the other platform, (will use the European Astra),&quot; the government source said.</p>
<p>Despite the controvery, Canalsatellite plans to forge ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;After the presentation of the platform tomorrow we will begin to sell the project,&quot; a spokesman for the group said.</p>
<p>He added that the platform already had 10,000 subscribers and has the additional advantage that 92 percent of the satellite dishes in Spain are directed toward Astra, while just eight percent are aimed at Hispasat.</p>
