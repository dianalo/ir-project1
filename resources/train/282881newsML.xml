<p>Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko, called in a New Year message for the restoration of peace in his sprawling and anarchic nation to enable elections to take place in 1997 as scheduled.</p>
<p>In his traditional end of year speech broadcast by state television from his jungle palace in Gbadolite, Mobutu on Wednesday urged the entire population to pull together to complete Zaire's much-delayed democratic transition.</p>
<p>But he announced no new initiatives to end a Tutsi-led revolt in which rebels have seized a slice of territory along the eastern border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda, further destabilising both Zaire and the Central African region.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who returned home on December 17 from four months in Europe where he had cancer surgery and rest, spoke with assurance and force despite his recent poor health.</p>
<p>&quot;Together we all have the sacred duty in 1997 to bring back peace, to restore the authority of the state, to relaunch the economy and improve the well-being of our population,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's in these conditions that we can see through the democratic process and guide our country towards the Third Republic,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Elections must be held by July under the transitional constitution.</p>
<p>Zaire's ruler of 31 years said his thoughts at this time were with victims of the war in the east and their families, who have been divided and tested.</p>
<p>He also addressed sympathy to the families of the hundreds of victims of plane, train and car crashes in Zaire in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;As if these misfortunes were not enough, our enemies have invaded our country, killed our fellow countrymen and destroyed what is left of the environment, social and economic infrastructure in North and South Kivu (provinces),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mobutu said Zaire had never known any rest during its turbulent history since independence from Belgium as it struggled to guard its independence and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The nation's vast mineral riches had often attracted greed and brought adversity, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have always reminded you that it is not easy to be Zaire... but again this time, with the help of God, we will come out of this combat as victors because the cause we are defending is just and legitimate,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said 1996 had not been all gloomy and that on the political front the country had made signifigant advances in the democratic process.</p>
<p>He singled out promulgation of laws which would eventually bring into effect a new federal constitution after a referendum, and the installation of offices of the electoral commission throughout the vast country.</p>
<p>Many Zaireans doubt elections will take place as scheduled because of the widening conflict in the east.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, bowed to pressure for democratic reform in 1990. Despite some advances in 1996 to complete Zaire's protracted transition, huge logistical obstacles remain before elections can take place.</p>
<p>Mobutu's palace at Gbadolite is in northern Zaire but his spokesman, Professor Kabuya Lumuna, says he will return to the sprawling capital Kinshasa within 10 days.</p>
