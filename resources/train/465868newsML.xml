<p>The head of Kazakhstan's Security Council said on Tuesday he was concerned about events across the border in China's turbulent northwest province of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>&quot;We are disturbed by events in Xinjiang,&quot; Beksultan Sarsekov, secretary of the Security Council, told a news conference in the Kazakh capital Almaty. It was Kazakhstan's first official reaction to the Xinjiang troubles.</p>
<p>Last month, anti-Chinese riots in the town of Yining, located near the Chinese-Kazakh border, left nine dead and 198 wounded. This followed increasing tensions between ethnic Chinese and Xinjiang's Moslem, Turkic-speaking Uighur population.</p>
<p>On Monday, one of several Kazakhstan-based Uighur organisations fighting for an independent &quot;East Turkestan&quot; in Xinjiang said China had executed five Uighur rioters. Chinese officials denied the allegation.</p>
<p>&quot;A certain part of the Chinese population is arguing for its sovereignty and would like to follow the Chechen scenario,&quot; Sarsekov said, in reference to Russia's bloody separatist conflict in Chechnya.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Uighurs) are bringing some instability to the region,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ex-Soviet states neighbouring Xinjiang share the region's Turkic language, Islam and a nomadic past, and have fuelled Uighur dreams of independence.</p>
<p>However, the Central Asian states are sensitive to pressure from China, with whom they and Russia plan to sign a pact next month reducing troop levels along their common borders.</p>
<p>Some Uighur exiles believe that may make them unwelcome in Kazakhstan. &quot;We will probably have to set up our headquarters in Istanbul or Germany,&quot; a Uighur leader told a congress of Uighur exile groups in Kazakhstan on Monday.</p>
<p>Sarsekov, while acknowledging the Uighur problem as China's internal affair, also gently criticised Beijing's tough crackdown on the Uighur unrest.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese authorities are resorting to harsh measures,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We can as human beings feel and understand (the Uighurs).&quot;</p>
