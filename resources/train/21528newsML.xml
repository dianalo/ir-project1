<p>Australian paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd is expected on Monday to post a heavy slump in annual profit, due to lower paper prices and weak demand in its home market, but analysts feel the worst may soon be over.</p>
<p>The group, which recently warned the stock market its 1995/96 (July/June) results would be down on its 1994/95 record net profit, is tipped to announce a fall of around eight percent in pre-abnormal net earnings.  </p>
<p>Stock analysts are forecasting on average a result of A$372 million pre-abnormal profit in 1995/96, according to BZW Investment Management's BARCEPS forecasting service.</p>
<p>But Amcor, which is highly sensitive to both world paper prices and the Australian economic cycle, is coming off a record year in 1994/95, when a surge in paper prices and a strong local economy lifted the bottom line by 40 percent to A$359.7 million.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1995/96, prices turned against the group, which relies for 45 percent of its turnover on white paper sales, and the domestic economy has remained flat.  </p>
<p>Prices have fallen in the order of about 30 percent since their peak in late calendar 1995, one paper market source said.</p>
<p>In a sign of the times, Amcor's 46-percent-owned paper merchant Spicers Paper Ltd reported last Monday a 35 percent slide in annual net profit to A$16.02 million.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some pretty tough markets there and I think the Australian economy is flat and the paper cycle has gone against them a bit,&quot; said Brisbane-based analyst John Clifford, of Morgan Stockbroking Ltd.  </p>
<p>Sales are expected to exceed last year's A$6.6 billion, but margins have been squeezed and are likely to remain tight through at least the first half of 1996/97, the analysts said.</p>
<p>But Clifford and a Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters they saw pre-abnormal net profit stabilising at around A$400 million in 1996/97 and recovering the next year.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as there is some sort of pick-up in economic growth, you will see it start to improve,&quot; the Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am positive in the longer term,&quot; she added.  </p>
<p>Amcor, one of the world's top ten paper and packaging groups, has paper packaging operations in Europe, the United States, Asia and New Zealand. It has maintained double-digit growth in net profit for all but four of the past five years.</p>
<p>Despite the current downturn, it has continued to expand its offshore operations, buying 51 percent of Belgian UCB SA's flexible packing unit in May for about A$200 million.</p>
<p>It has also allocated A$380 million to expand paper production in Australia, where it commands about 40 percent of the market for fine papers.  </p>
<p>Morgan's Clifford said he believed these and other capital investments -- totalling A$1.5 billion over the past two and a half years -- would begin to bolster the bottom line in 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;These sorts of programmes will certainly come through with increased profits through 1998 (1997/98) and especially through 1999 (1998/99),&quot; Clifford said.</p>
<p>&quot;The four to five-year outlook is pretty strong,&quot; he added.</p>
