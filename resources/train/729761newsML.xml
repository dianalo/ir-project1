<p>DMK THREATENS TO PULL OUT OF UNITED FRONT</p>
<p>The Dravida Munneta Kazhagam (DMK) party threatened to pull out its ministers from the United Front government of Prime Minister Gujral and support it from outside. A statement issued by leader of the DMK party M. Karunanidhi who is also the chief minister of Tamil Nadu state said some of the constituents of the United Front were implementing &quot;personal minimum programmes&quot; rather than the common minimum programme of the Front, and had ganged up within the Front to settle scores with each other. DMK sources said the party was not going to withdraw from the government immediately. They wanted the issues raised by Karunanidhi to be solved and guidelines formulated for those who were involved in scandals.</p>

<p>NO FOREIGN EQUITY IN DOMESTIC AIRLINES</p>
<p>A comprehensive second draft of a national policy on civil aviation has ruled out allowing overseas airlines to pick up equity in domestic airline ventures. One of its clauses says that foreign airlines will not be permitted to pick up equity directly or indirectly in the domestic air transport sector. This is contrary to first draft which said domestic operators would be allowed to have foreign equity up to a maximum of 40 percent. Officials close to the prime minister said there was no political will to allow foreign airlines to pick up stake in domestic ventures.</p>

<p>NEW POLICY ON CAR KIT IMPORT LIKELY</p>
<p>The government may consider amending its policy governing the import of automobiles in completely-knocked-down condition (CKD) or in semi-knocked down (SKD) condition. The customs duty on such components will be slashed to 30 percent. Along with a countervailing duty the total duty will be about 50 percent, the Commerce Ministry said in a detailed policy paper. Under the present policy, imported CKD or SKD are levied a customs duty of 98 percent including countervailing duty. Those who intend to set up auto ventures in India would have to bring in a minimum equity of $100 million and achieve 75 percent indigenisation in five years from the date of commercial production.</p>

<p>SUPERVISORY SYSTEM FOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry has proposed a multi-agency supervisory system for credit rating agencies. The ministry has also sought to limit the number of rating agencies that should be licensed to conduct business. Money-market related activities of rating firms will be monitored and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while bourses will come under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Activities of the rating agencies falling outside the purview of the RBI and the SEBI will be supervised by authorities dealing with the concerned areas.</p>

<p>FISCAL DEFICIT MAY CROSS 4.5 PERCENT</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's plan to cap the fiscal deficit at 4.5 percent during fiscal 1997/98 (April-March) may not succeed due to a potential shortfall in revenue collection and the increasing expenditure. The plan to absorb 90 billion rupees from the oil pool deficit during the current fiscal and an estimated loss of 50 billion rupees due to the transfer of 29 percent of the central taxes to the state governments will put pressure on expenditure, finance ministry sources said. This coupled with a revenue collection fall may shoot the fiscal defict even higher.</p>

<p>HALDIA PETRO TO RAISE $300 MLN FROM OVERSEAS MARKETS</p>
<p>Haldia Petrochemicals is planning to raise $300 million from the overseas market. This cross-border lease finance deal is slated to hit Euro markets within the next three months. It will raise the amount in two tranches with $150 million by a guaranteed facility and the remaining $150 million on non-recourse basis. ANZ investment Bank, a division of the ANZ Grindlays Bank, has procured the mandate for the cross-border lease deal. The company is aiming at external commercial borrowings to fund the rupee cost gap which is about 2.5 billion rupees due to an increase in its project's cost.</p>
