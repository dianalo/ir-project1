<p>Indonesia's ruling Golkar party on Wednesday defended a government ban on the use of the name of ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri during the general election campagn as a measure to protect national unity.</p>
<p>Abdul Gafur, the most senior of Golkar's seven chairmen, said his party supported the ban, issued after a show of public support for an informal alliance between Megawati loyalists and those of the Moslem-based United Development Party (PPP) ahead of the May 29 general election.</p>
<p>Supporters of the alliance have waved flags at public meetings in the past week emblazoned with the words &quot;Mega-Bintang&quot;, a reference to the tie-up between Megawati and the PPP, which uses the bintang, or the star, as its symbol.</p>
<p>&quot;Every slogan and every theme should be approved by the police, and this one is not permitted as it has not been given permission by the police,&quot; Gafur, second in the party's rankings after general chairman Harmoko, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Megawati was ousted last year from the leadership of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) by a government-backed faction headed by deputy parliamentary speaker Surjadi, and has not been permitted to contest the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The government only recognises one PDI led by Surjadi,&quot; said Gafur, a former minister. The involvement of police in the regulation of campaign slogans was not anti-democratic, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the government does not set up rules like that sometimes they will make anti-government and anti-religion slogans that could be very dangerous. We just want to uphold something that is very important, that is, the unity of the nation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Attorney-General Singgih, head of the official election supervision committee, was quoted as saying on Tuesday that President Suharto had ordered him to enforce the new rules, which prohibit banners and pictures linking Megawati and PPP.</p>
<p>&quot;We ask the three contestants' task forces to haul down those banners and pictures,&quot; Singgih said, adding that banners and other campaign material must be approved by the police.</p>
<p>Only the government-backed faction of the PDI led by Surjadi, the PPP and Golkar are allowed to contest the poll.</p>
<p>The General Election Institute (LPU) last year rejected a list of election candidates put forward by Megawati, saying she did not represent the genuine wing of the PDI.</p>
<p>PPP Secretary-General Tosari Wijaya was quoted by the Jakarta Post on Wednesday as saying the party could not stop people from using banners linking Megawati with his party.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not appropriate to ban people from expressing their political aspirations,&quot; Wijaya told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot stop those supporters participating in the campaign. Everything has been spontaneous.&quot;</p>
<p>PPP chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum was quoted by the official Antara news agency as saying the appearance of the slogan &quot;Mega-Bintang&quot; had nothing to do with Megawati.</p>
<p>&quot;Mega-Bintang means great star. It has nothing to do with Megawati,&quot; Metareum told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mega is Megawati and we cannot accept that,&quot; Gafur said. &quot;This is a kind of manipulation of the campaign by inserting the name of Megawati so they can profit by that.&quot;</p>
