<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spot up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates end down, spot up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Wednesday on rumours that the central bank would enforce a ban on state banks trading on the state debt secondary market, traders said. Traders said a meeting was held on Tuesday in Beijing to discuss the enforcement.</p>
<p>At a meeting last week, the central bank told state banks to phase out their trading on the state debt repurchase market to drive bank money out of the stock market. The banks were told not to build new positions but only offset existing positions.  </p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active 28-day contract fell to 12.15 percent from 13.30 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Total turnover shrank to 3.63 million lots from 8.83 million. One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Traders said the higher rates of the early-maturing contracts pushed buyers to trade on the mid-term contracts, making the 28-day contract the most active today.</p>
<p>They said if the rumours on the enforcement meeting was confirmed, the repo rates would rise in the short term.</p>
<p>The frequent new issues and listings on the domestic A share markets would also help to boost the rates, they said.  </p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly up on institutional support, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active three-year note that matures in Sept 1999, lost to 102.44 yuan from 102.36 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the eight-contract market fell to 835,297 lots from 1.16 million on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders believed the spots would move in a narrow range in the next few days with liquidity flowing into the new two-year treasury note, the issue of which began on Wednesday.</p>
