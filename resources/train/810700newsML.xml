<p>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced on Saturday that he is leaving his wife of 28 years for his parliamentary secretary.</p>
<p>Cook made the shock announcement after the News of The World tabloid splashed a front-page story for its Sunday edition under the headline: &quot;Cabinet minister and his secret love.&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair, holidaying in Italy, said he viewed the announcement as a personal tragedy but stressed that the breakup in no way affected Cook's job in government.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old foreign secretary, one of the leaders of Britain's new Labour government, confirmed he was leaving his 51-year-old wife Margaret for Gaynor Regan, 41, his trusted aide for the past five years.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make clear that the responsibility for this is entirely mine,&quot; Cook said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I accept that I am a public figure but I would ask for the privacy of those involved to be respected at a very painful time.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Blair, who three months ago swept to a landslide election victory, said: &quot;He sees this as a personal tragedy for those involved which does not affect Robin Cook's capability as a truly outstanding foreign secretary.&quot;</p>
