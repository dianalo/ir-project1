<p>Leading Lithuanian banks Vilniaus and Hermis maintained their rise to new highs by the close of share trade on Monday and brokers said rising share prices may continue to boost the market this week.</p>
<p>The leading official list rose 25.95 points to 1043.67 while the wider group A index lost 13.13 points to 1833.91.</p>
<p>Central market turnover rebounded to a healthy one million litas from 754,000 litas by the close.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnover is increasing and this shows interest in the market is increasing and will only continue to increase in the future,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Brokers said an undervalued market and solid six-month results were driving investors, who have been reluctant about the Vilnius bourse for most of the spring and summer.</p>
<p>Dealers also said leading shares were shadowing each other.</p>
<p>&quot;If Hermis Bank increases, then Vilniaus Bank follows; if Vilniaus Bank increases, then Hermis follows,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank advanced to 275.10 litas from its former best of 260 litas in 93,000 litas central market turnover.</p>
<p>Brokers said Vilniaus Bank was being helped by its 21.7 million litas six-month profits for 1997, which were up from 11.7 million litas in the same period last year. They say low domestic supply is also driving up the price of its shares.</p>
<p>Rival Hermis Bank rose to 255 litas from 250.20 litas in heavy 264,000 litas turnover on the central market and saw block trades of 128,000 litas at a range of 25 litas to 255 litas.</p>
<p>One broker said the 25 litas price was probably a technical transfer of shares and would not bring down the price.</p>
<p>&quot;Hermis will reach 260 litas, maybe 265 litas or 270 litas,&quot; one broker said.</p>
