<title>UK: NWE gasoline weakens on crude and sloppy market.</title>
<headline>NWE gasoline weakens on crude and sloppy market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gasoline weakened on Thursday pressured by falling crude prices, lacklustre demand and relatively high ARA inventories, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's looking quite sloppy,&quot; a trader said. &quot;It shouldn't be but not much stuff appears to have shifted to the States yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Two 60,000 tonne cargoes were reported to have traded to the United States late on Wednesday although some players expressed surprise at this news saying the arbitrage door to the United States was barely ajar.</p>
<p>Shipbrokers reported that the 60,000 tonne Adamas was fixed out of Antwerp for the U.S. Atlantic Coast loading April 10.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps they did it to get some material out of the region,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the arb was just about open yesterday, but I don't think it's workable now,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>No prices were heard for the deals but traders said given the amount of spare product in the ARA region, barges were barely commanding a premium over cargo prices at the moment.</p>
<p>A Eurograde barge traded at $195 earlier, but bid/offer levels spent most of the day around the $192/$193 level.</p>
<p>A Eurograde cargo was heard offered in Hamburg. Traders pegged its cif value around $202/$204.</p>
<p>Swaps were pegged around the $193/$194 level for April and $1 above there for May.</p>
