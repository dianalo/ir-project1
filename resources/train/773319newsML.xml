<text>
<p>American Skiing Co on Friday said it  agreed to buy the Steamboat Ski Resort and the Heavenly Ski Resort  from Kamori International Corp for $288.3 million.</p>
<p>The deal, expected to close in October, will make American Skiing  the largest ski-resort company in the United States, ahead of rival  Vail Resorts Inc, spokeswoman Cathleen Willis told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Maine-based American Skiing -- which markets itself as the &quot;Beast  of the East&quot; -- will have a major presence in the western United States  after completion of the deal. Its western resorts will then account  for more than half of its skier days -- an industry measure accounting  for one customer skiing all or part of one day, spokesman Skip King  said.</p>
<p>The Steamboat Ski Resort in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and the Heavenly  Ski Resort, which straddles the California and Nevada state lines  near Lake Tahoe, will add an estimated 1.75 million skier days, the  company said.  </p>
<p>When the deal closes, American Skiing will own 11 ski resorts, with  at least one in each major skiing market across the country. The 11  resorts combined for about 4.9 million skier days in the 1996-97 season,  or about nine percent of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Other terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p>
