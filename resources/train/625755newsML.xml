<p>Susi Susanti's hopes of a second world badminton title were shattered again on Friday.</p>
<p>The stylish Indonesian was swept aside in the quarter-finals 11-5 11-2 by 19-year-old Gong Zhichao of China.</p>
<p>Susanti, a former Olympic, world and all-England champion, has been hinting at retirement for some time now. She is married to long-time fiance Allan Budi Kusuma.</p>
<p>But despite Friday's defeat she indicated she would be playing on. &quot;I would like to play for maybe one more year,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;I'd also like to help train the youngsters who are coming through.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to try for other tournaments because I still have the motivation to play and to win,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Whether she can handle the emerging talent, much of it Chinese, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>China dominated last week's Sudiman Cup team event and they have made their presence felt agian, providing six of the eight women's quarter-finalists.</p>
<p>While Gong dealt with Susanti, Wang Chen put paid to Mia Audina, the third seed, 11-6 11-4 in another big blow for the Indonesians.</p>
<p>With four Chinese fighting out the other two quarter-finals it meant that all the women's semifinalists on Saturday will be from China.</p>
<p>Indonesian hopes now rest with men's defending champion Heryanto Arbi, who fought back to beat Denmark's Thomas Stuer-Lauridesn 10-15 15-6 15-1.</p>
<p>In Saturday's semifinals he plays Denmark's Peter Rasmussen, a good 15-2 18-17 winner over South Korea's Park Sung-woo.</p>
<p>The other semifinal will be between Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and former world junior champion Sun Jun of China.</p>
<p>Hoyer-Larsen wobbled for a while against former world champion Joko Suprianto of Indonesia before emerging a 10-15 15-9 15-5 winner.</p>
<p>Greater patience and stamina paid off for Hoyer-Larsen, who reported that &quot;in the end it was like hooking a fish and bringing it in&quot;.</p>
