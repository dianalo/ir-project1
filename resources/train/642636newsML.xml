<p>A steady stream of dollar demand nudged the rand weaker in listless Friday trade as exporters held it at bay at the 4.4850 level.</p>
<p>By 1400, the local currency was trading at 4.4830/4860 against the dollar, a touch weaker from its overnight level of 4.4815/4830.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen steady importer demand (for dollars) all day,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;The rand/mark cross has been looking good so we've had constant demand.&quot;</p>
<p>The rand firmed to a day's best level of 0.3885 marks bid earlier as the dollar powered to a fresh 39-month high against the German unit in the immediate wake of latest U.S. unemployment data.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit touched an intraday high of 1.7423 marks at the New York opening, but eased back to around the 1.7340 later on profit-taking.</p>
<p>Local traders said that on the topside of the rand's 4.4795 to 4.4830 bid range, exporters were keen to sell dollars, resulting in equilibrium in the market on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very liquid, balanced market at the moment. Barring anything untoward, it will probably be quiet again on Monday,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last quoted at 0.3866/3869 marks from 0.3853/3858 marks overnight, at 25.7324/7720 yen from 25.7541/7937 yen and at 7.2810/2904 on sterling from 7.3030/3101 previously.  </p>
<p>Activity on the bond market was equally subdued, as the the R150 patrolled a tight 14.545 to 14.615 percent range on the day.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, it was pegged at 14.615 percent -- slightly up from 14.59 percent late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was initially hit by local profit-taking which pushed the R150 to 14.60 pct by 0700 GMT. It then held a tight two-point range ahead of the release of the U.S. jobs data.</p>
<p>The overall impression from the report, which showed total U.S. unemployment at 4.8 percent of the population in May from 4.9 percent in April, was that the Federal Reserve was likely to move on interest rates when it next meets in July.</p>
<p>But dealers said that while the U.S. long bond had ticked up to around 6.92 pct from 6.88 pct before the data, it had had little impact on the local market.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some good buying at the 14.60 level and it looked like it was good hands,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>In general, dealers said that the market was still consolidating after its heady gains from the 15.11 percent area two weeks ago.</p>
<p>That trend was expected to continue into next week, although in the longer term, dealers said they expected the recent bull run to be extended.</p>
<p>On the money market, three-month NCD rates edged lower to 16.05 percent offered from 16.10 to 16.15 percent on Thursday, while the 90-day BA rate was pegged at between 15.45 to 15.60 percent from 15.55 to 15.75 percent previously.</p>
<p>South Africa's money market shortage rose to 6.472 billion rand on Thursday from 5.821 billion rand on Wednesday, the Reserve Bank said.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures showed foreigners were net sellers of 519.62 million rand's worth of South African bonds on Thursday after buying of 349.85 million rand's worth on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes were pegged at 41.3 billion rand on Thursday -- settlement day -- from 6.46 billion rand previously.</p>
