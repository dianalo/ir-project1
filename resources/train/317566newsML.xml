<p>The shuttle Atlantis astronauts bid farewell to the crew of space station Mir on Sunday and closed the hatches between the two craft in preparation for their departure.</p>
<p>Atlantis was due to undock from Mir at 9:15 p.m. EST on Sunday (0215 GMT Monday) after five days of joint operations in which a new U.S. astronaut took up residence on Mir and more than three tons of supplies were moved between the craft.</p>
<p>Atlantis arrived at Mir on Tuesday to pick up U.S. astronaut John Blaha, who has been aboard the station since September, and drop off his replacement, Jerry Linenger.</p>
<p>The three Mir crewmen waved goodbye as the hatch connecting Atlantis and Mir was swung shut at 7:38 a.m. EST (1238 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;Goodbye, goodbye,&quot; said Linenger, at the beginning of a four-month stay on Mir. &quot;I'll see you in the summer.&quot;</p>
<p>Blaha, just days from his return to earth, said on Sunday he was looking forward to being reunited with his family but he would miss the view of earth from space.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a real pleasure to look at our beautiful planet,&quot; he said. &quot;I love working up here but ... my wife and I have been married for over 30 years and I didn't realise I would miss her as much as I did.&quot;</p>
<p>The shuttle and Mir crews staged a farewell for the television cameras about three hours before they said their actual goodbyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately we are saying goodbye to the excellent Atlantis crew,&quot; Mir commander Valeri Korzun said during the ceremony, which was conducted almost entirely in Russian. &quot;We wish them a safe landing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are also saying goodbye to our colleague the American astronaut John Blaha,&quot; he said. &quot;We have had problems, but despite everything and anything we have remained friends and we have completed our tasks.&quot;</p>
<p>Blaha thanked his cosmonaut crewmates for their hospitality and stressed the importance of NASA's cooperative efforts with Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;This programme is not only important for space exploration, but also for the relationship between the countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony Linenger peeled off his gray shuttle shirt and playfully tossed it after the departing shuttle crew.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't need that anymore,&quot; he joked as he pulled on a blue Russian space station uniform.</p>
<p>Linenger will perform more than 80 experiments and conduct a space walk, the first from Mir by an American.</p>
<p>The shuttle will return to the station in May to collect the 42-year-old astronaut and bring his replacement, Mike Foale.</p>
<p>Atlantis was scheduled to return to earth at Florida's Kennedy Space Centre on Wednesday. But NASA officials were considering extending the flight by one day to complete a test of an experimental space treadmill.</p>
