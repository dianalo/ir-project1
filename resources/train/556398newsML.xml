<p>Blue chips at Bombay exchanges closed sharply lower on Friday, as worries about a possible hike in petroleum prices and turmoil in the ruling coalition government brought about selling pressure, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks took a beating across-the-board,&quot; said Sanjay Vaid, chief dealer at Lloyds Securities. &quot;The hike in petroleum price which is expected to be announced shortly pulled down prices,&quot;</p>
<p>In a delayed opening at the Bombay exchange, stocks fell in jittery trade after Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Thursday reminded investors he could not avoid raising the prices of petroleum products, market participants said.  </p>
<p>Gujral told state-run Doordarshan television in an interview on Thursday he would need the nation's support and confidence in tackling the huge oil pool deficit -- pegged at 155 billion rupees ($4.32 million) by the end of 1996/97 (April-March).</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot go on living with this kind of deficit that you are soon reaching a stage where you do not have the money to buy. I do not want to reach that stage,&quot; Gujral said, adding that a decision on the issue was &quot;unavoidable.&quot;</p>
<p>The oil pool deficit is the subsidy the federal government owes to state-run oil companies for selling their products well below international prices.  </p>
<p>A corruption scandal involving Laloo Prasad Yadav, leader of Prime Minister Gujral's Janata Dal party has cast a shadow on the 11-day old government.</p>
<p>&quot;There was heavy speculative selling on expectation of some political uncertainty next week,&quot; said Sanjeev Choithani, chief dealer at brokers Pashupati Advani.</p>
<p>Shares of Indian Rayon jumped 36.0 rupees, or 10 percent, to 396.25 at the Bombay exchange after the firm said it would meet on May 6 to consider a bonus equity issue. The stock crossed its 52-week high of 377.0 rupees. The company on Friday posted a 16 percent rise in 1996/97 (April-March) net profit.</p>
