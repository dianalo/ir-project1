<p>Cape-based deciduous fruit marketer Unifruco on Monday reported a 20 percent increase in payments to producers to a record 1.45 billion rand for the year to September 1996 but said its net profit had fallen 25 percent to 16.6 million rand.</p>
<p>The unlisted co-operative's dividend per share has been cut to 60 cents from 90 cents the previous year.</p>
<p>The results were announced at the group's annual general meeting in Stellenbosch by chairman Dave Gant, who predicted that in the current year pre-tax profits would be increased by 10 million rand because of improved exports.</p>
<p>&quot;This would result in substantially higher earnings per share for the year ending September 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gant said that, despite lower export volumes in 1996, a weaker rand and strong demand for Cape products had boosted export earnings for its producer suppliers.</p>
<p>However, the company had to absorb increased operating costs as a result of expanded export areas and levels of service to the deciduous fruit industry without any corresponding increase in its commission.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of volume growth, with the exception of apples and pears that have been fairly static, exports of all other deciduous fruit kinds have more than doubled since 1980 and are expected to increase by 25 percent to 65 million boxes by 1999/2000,&quot; Gant said.</p>
<p>Gross export values had grown to 2.7 billion rand from 1.1 billion rand in 1990 with a projected turnover of 4.2 billion rand in 1999/2000.</p>
<p>Gross payments to producers had increased to 1.6 billion rand from 600 million rand in 1990 and were likely to be more than 2.4 billion rand by 1999/2000.</p>
<p>Gant hit out at &quot;uninformed commentators&quot; who had criticised Unifruco recently for being a &quot;statutory monopoly&quot; and had supported the deregulation of the industry.</p>
<p>Gant said that although Unifruco had up to now enjoyed the benefit of being the sole export agent for South African deciduous fruit to certain regions, &quot;It has not and will not seek any statutory measure to protect its own commercial success.&quot;</p>
<p>Should the Deciduous Fruit Board be dismantled, Unifruco believes that it could maintain the support of 90 percent of growers because of its track record.</p>
