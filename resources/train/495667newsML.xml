<headline>TPS denies Frere seeks M6, TPS stake sale.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>French digital satellite television station Television Par Satellite (TPS) on Tuesday denied a newspaper article which said that Belgian businessman Albert Frere is considering selling the 28 percent he holds directly and indirectly in TPS.</p>
<p>A TPS spokesman said the talk was &quot;without basis&quot;.</p>
<p>Tuesday's edition of the daily Le Figaro said Frere could take advantage of the proposed merger between Lyonnaise des Eaux and Compagnie de Suez to sell the merged entity the 39.4 percent his Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television (CLT) holds in private French terrestrial station M6-Metropole TV.</p>
<p>At the same time he could seek to sell the 20 percent he owns directly in TPS and the eight percent held via M6 to Lyonnaise-Suez, the paper said.</p>
<p>Frere, who could raise some 4.5 billion francs from such sales, could then move into communication company Havas by exchanging 50 percent of the shares his Audiofina holds in CLT for nearly 22 percent of Havas, it said.</p>
<p>No one was immediately available for comment at Havas or M6.</p>
<p>M6 and its parents, CLT and Lyonnaise des Eaux, have a stake in TPS. French private terrestrial channel TF1 holds 25 percent, and France Telecom and France Television also together hold 25 percent.</p>
