<p>Hong Kong stocks closed weaker on Monday after a volatile day which saw the Hang Seng Index hitting a new record high, before retreating on profit-taking and nervousness over China-related red chips, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed down 133.13 points, or 0.88 percent, at 15,021.23.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$26.33 billion (US$3.4 billion), marginally down on Friday's record figure of HK$26.6 billion.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Hang Seng Index had touched a new record high, rising 167 points to 15,322 as investors showed their bullishness on the July 1 handover to China.</p>
<p>&quot;(It's) very volatile, and very confused,&quot; said James Osborne, sales director at ING Barings.</p>
<p>The day was characterised by massive volatility and capital flows, but one broker predicted further short-term record highs because &quot;that's what everybody wants&quot;.</p>
<p>A broker with a European institution said much of the liquidity was flowing in from China ahead of the handover, but the flows were short-term.</p>
<p>Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule after more than 150 years of British rule.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Bank Ltd helped drag the market down, as it slid HK$5.50 to HK$104.00, partly on profit-taking after speculation of Chinese interests taking a stake in the bank had earlier pushed it to a new high on Friday.</p>
<p>The market was also dampened by China's State Council announcement on Friday that transferral of domestic assets into China-controlled firms overseas would require government approval if the purpose was to inject into a listed vehicle.</p>
<p>Brokers said the announcement was prompting a re-appraisal of red chips, with investors focusing on their fundamentals rather than on potential future asset injections.</p>
<p>Red chips are companies which are Hong Kong-based, but China-controlled.</p>
<p>Red chip Beijing Enterprises Holding Ltd, usually a darling among investors, was one of the biggest losers, slipping HK$1.60 to HK$47.60, and Shanghai Industrial Holdings Ltd lost HK$1.50 to HK$43.00.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc lost HK$3.00, partly on the back of the falls in its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank.</p>
<p>Property companies also slipped, with Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd losing HK$1.50 to HK$93.75, Henderson Land Development Co Ltd easing HK$1.75 to HK$70.50 and New World Development Co Ltd dropping HK$1.10 to HK$47.40.</p>
<p>(US$1 = HK$7.74)</p>
