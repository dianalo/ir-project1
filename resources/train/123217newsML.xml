<p>A British teenager was sentenced to six years in a Russian labour camp on Thursday for smuggling 4.6 kg (10 lb) of cocaine into Russia.</p>
<p>Karen Henderson, 18, listened impassively as Judge Sergei Lebedev dismissed her claim that she had bought her suitcase at Havana airport without knowing that it contained drugs.</p>
<p>Her family were visibly upset and her sister Dawn burst into tears as Henderson was led away by guards.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe in justice. I really hope that your honour has taken all the facts into account. I told you the truth. I hope you also believe in justice,&quot; Henderson said in a brief statement before her sentence was delivered.</p>
<p>British embassy officials said Henderson was likely to appeal against the sentence within a week. She may also seek a pardon from President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Russian officials discovered the cocaine when they stopped Henderson at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport last February.</p>
<p>She said she had noticed her suitcase was damaged as she prepared to catch a flight from Havana to Warsaw via Moscow and bought a replacement case from a man she met at the airport.</p>
<p>Henderson is being held in Moscow's overcrowded Butyrskaya prison, which is also home to Dutch woman Suzanne Vorstenbosch, serving a six-year sentence after pleading guilty to smuggling cocaine into Russia.</p>
