<title>FRANCE: Publicis founder's daughter to sell stake.</title>
<headline>Publicis founder's daughter to sell stake.</headline>

<p>A Publicis spokeswoman confirmed on Monday that Michele Bleustein-Blanchet, youngest daughter of Publicis founder Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, plants to sell her stake in the French advertising group.</p>
<p>But she denied a newspaper report that there was a row between family members.</p>
<p>The sale would be carried out only under conditions where &quot;the independence of the group and its family control would be maintained,&quot; the Publicis spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The advertising group is due to make a statement on the matter later on Monday, she said.</p>
<p>Monday's edition of financial daily La Tribune said two of Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet's daughters were embroiled in a row over one of them trying to sell her stake. The Publicis founder died a year ago.</p>
<p>It said Elisabeth Badinter, the founder's second daughter and chairman of Somarel, is using a complex legal structure to prevent her sister from selling her various stakes.</p>
<p>Michele Bleustein-Blanchet's holdings include a one third stake in Somarel, the Publicis holding company which in turn owns 38.4 percent of Publicis's capital and 45 percent of its voting rights.</p>
<p>She also owns over seven percent of Publicis directly. Altogether her share of Publicis, direct and indirect, is estimated at 20 percent, worth nearly a billion francs, La Tribune said.</p>
