<title>NIGERIA: Nigeria frees six detainees awaiting trial.</title>
<headline>Nigeria frees six detainees awaiting trial.</headline>

<p>Nigeria's military government has released six people held in police custody for between six and 12 years without trial, a human rights group which handled their cases said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Rights Project (CRP) said the six, whose names were given and who are not prominent persons, were freed last Wednesday in compliance with a Lagos high court order.</p>
<p>The court ruled that their detention without trial for such long periods was illegal and void, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The freed persons have been in police custody without trial for periods ranging from six to 12 years and for offences such as suspected robbery and murder,&quot; said Sonny Onyegbula, head of the CRP's legal department.</p>
<p>He said CRP's legal department, which provides free services to the under-priviledged and victims of human rights abuses, in December secured the release of 37 other persons detained for long periods without trial.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working on a lot of other cases and we are optimistic we will succeed in securing the release of those invloved,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Military-ruled Nigeria has been under fire from the local and international communities for alleged human rights abuses and lack of democracy.</p>
<p>Africa's most populous country slumped into crisis in 1993 when the army annulled an election aimed at restoring democracy.</p>
<p>Some political detainees were released last year but dozens of others opposed to the government still remain in detention.</p>
<p>The military authorities maintain they are not political prisoners.</p>
