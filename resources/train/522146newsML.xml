<headline>SIMEX Nikkei futures break resistance, may head up.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-04-18</dateline>

<p>The lead SIMEX Nikkei futures contract closed above key resistance on Friday, suggesting the market was ready for a new, higher trading range, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 June contract closed 310 points up at 18,375 after hitting a high of 18,410 in early afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said the close above 18,300 was a good sign.</p>
<p>&quot;By closing above 18,300, it has taken out a stubborn resistance level and probably means we are headed to a higher range for next week,&quot; said one dealer who follows technical charts closely.  </p>
<p>He said the upward momentum had been provided by strong demand for financial stocks and blue chips in Japan, particularly from some program buyers, and some signs Japan's economy may be stronger than expected.</p>
<p>A comment on Friday by the director-general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, Eisuke Sakakibara, to Reuters that the possibility of the Japanese economy contracting was less than people thought, was also cited by another dealer as a positive factor.</p>
<p>But dealers said the upward trend could be broken if the U.S. stock market fell sharply on Friday evening.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the upward momentum stalls we could turn down again to test 18,000 points,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The SIMEX April MSCI Taiwan index contract fell 2.3 to end at 344.7. Turnover was at 1,846 lots.</p>
