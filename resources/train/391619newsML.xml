<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>

<p>Italian debt instruments staged a late comeback after a weak start and kept pushing higher to end well up on the day while the lira strengthened on the mark.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was still fairly tense however despite the gains, as it was awaiting the first wave of preliminary February consumer prices data from five sample cities, due to be released after 1630 GMT.</p>
<p>Economists forecast a month on month rate of 0.2 percent, the same as January, while the year on year rate is seen at 2.5, slightly below the 2.6 percent registered last month. First to report are Milan, Bologna, Genoa, Trieste, Perugia and Venice.  </p>
<p>The remaining five of the advance party report on Friday and the final data are due from Istat on March 4.</p>
<p>In terms of the day's action, brokers said after a rocky start, in which Btps were sold down with Bunds, the March future on LIFFE bounced from support at 129.30 and gathered momentum as it rose, to stand 98 basis points up at 130.65 in late trade.</p>
<p>The November 2006 Btp ended 41 basis points up at 104.49 and was yielding 7.22 percent with a spread over the benchmark Bund of 170 basis points, a marked improvement on the 180 seen earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The lira rebounded to 990.05/0.40 per mark from near 997.  </p>
<p>Newswise, Prime Minister Romano Prodi ran into trouble from the opposition and coalition allies after announcing he planned a mini-budget to beat back the budget deficit.</p>
<p>The leftist PDS were unhappy at not being consulted fully over the move, while the hard left Communist Refoundation continued to warn it wanted no new taxes and was against spending cuts.</p>
