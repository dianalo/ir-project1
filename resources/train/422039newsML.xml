<p>Credit Suisse Group said on Wednesday it plunged to a 1996 net loss of 2.59 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion) due to extraordinary charges of 5.4 billion for restructuring and providing for bad loans.</p>
<p>But based on what Credit Suisse described as &quot;a gratifying start to the current year,&quot; the bank's management decided to pay out an unchanged dividend of four francs per share.</p>
<p>&quot;The year 1997 has begun positively, and we are therefore very confident of our ability to reach the goals we have set,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lukas Muehlemann, the new chief executive hired from Swiss Reinsurance, told a news conference that Credit Suisse expected structural improvements in its earnings during 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;For the current year Credit Suisse Group expects structural imporvements in earning power throughout the group and, in particular, in Swiss business,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shares in Credit Suisse, firmed in early trading on the Swiss Exchange by 2.25 francs to 160.75.</p>
<p>Although the loss was larger than expected, dealers said the outlook seemed positive.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse, along with Switzerland's two other major banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., last year changed their method for calculating provisions for loans.</p>
<p>Swiss banks have been hard hit by the long-running downturn in the Swiss economy and have had to write-off billions of francs in bad loans in recent years.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse also embarked on a large-scale restructuring that involved dropping the name of CS Holding from the group and creating four new operational units.</p>
<p>The 1996 net loss is slightly larger than the 2.1 billion franc loss Credit Suisse forecast last year when it announced it was changing its method for calculating credit risks.</p>
<p>The difference is due to a 195 million franc increase in general reserves for banking risks as well as a decision not to activate 170 million in U.S. losses for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Apart from the extraordinary charges, Credit Suisse's operating results last year improved slightly with pre-tax operating profit rising three percent to 2.47 billion francs.</p>
<p>Gross earnings from normal banking business rose 17 percent to 12.89 with trading income soaring 33 percent to 3.9 billion.</p>
<p>Profits from trading such instruments as currencies, shares or metals accounted for roughly one-third of total gross earnings while interest business accounted for 27 percent. ($ = 1.481 Swiss Francs)</p>
