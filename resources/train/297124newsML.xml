<title>FRANCE: Paribas to sell Credit du Nord to Societe Generale.</title>

<text>
<p>French financial holding company Paribas will start talks on a quick sale of its retail banking unit Credit du Nord to Societe Generale for 2.2 billion francs ($415 million), the two companies said Thursday.</p>
<p>The move was welcomed by analysts, who said it allowed Paribas to divest itself of retail banking and concentrate on its core businesses, and helped Societe Generale to meet a goal of boosting its domestic retail banking presence.</p>
<p>The two companies said in a joint statement that the transaction would take place in two stages.</p>
<p>&quot;During the first phase, Societe Generale would take a controlling interest in Credit du Nord and would make a commitment to acquire the remainder of the company's equity within the next three years,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>Paribas has been trying since 1995 to get rid of its retail banking business to concentrate on international investment and merchant banking, and specialised financial services.</p>
<p>The joint statement said that for Societe Generale, the deal &quot;offers a strategic fit with its objective of expanding retail banking operations in France.&quot;</p>
<p>Credit du Nord will benefit from the support of a major retail bank to accelerate its development and improve profitability, it said.</p>
<p>Banking analysts said the move was good for Paribas, which said it would make a 600 million franc ($113 million) capital gain from the sale, but perhaps a less obvious positive for the buyer.</p>
<p>The stock market cheered the deal, sending shares in Paribas and Societe General 4.02 percent and 2.22 percent higher, respectively, at the close.</p>
