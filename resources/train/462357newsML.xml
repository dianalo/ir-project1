<p>In a sign of intensifying competition in the nascent market for delivering content automatically over the Internet, one rival is prepared to offer competitive discounting.</p>
<p>Adapting competitive marketing tactics of the consumer and shrink-wrapped software business to the Internet market is Wayfarer Communications, one of more than two dozen companies now offering push technology.  </p>
<p>&quot;Push computing&quot; describes the concept of sending automatic updates of news, advertising, software and other products over the Internet or internal corporate networks known as intranets.</p>
<p>A representative of Wayfarer said the company will from March 31 begin offering a &quot;20/20 Vision&quot; promotion in which it will charge for a 20-day evaluation of its INCISA product and a 20 percent discount for customers who install INCISA instead of consumer-based push approaches.  </p>
<p>PointCast Network, which spearheaded the push market a year ago when it introduced software which computer users could install to receive regular updates of news and data, along with advertising which supports the model.</p>
<p>Wayfarer is expected to announce the new promotional pricing plan on Monday, the representative said.</p>
<p>The pricing strategy aims to differentiate Wayfarer from rivals, such as PointCast and BackWeb, whose products Wayfarer said contain advertising and other non-business content which it claims can be distracting to employees.  </p>
<p>Wayfarer also says its technology can filter and push new information in real time, rather than many other technologies which instead &quot;pull&quot; down the information at designated intervals.</p>
<p>Wayfarer's INCISA server is priced starting at $5,000 for 100 seats with discounts for higher-volume purchases.</p>
<p>The 20/20 Vision program provides a 20-day evaluation at no charge and a $1,000 credit to customers who replace a PointCast or BackWeb server with INCISA through May 30.</p>
<p>Ira Machefsky, an analyst at market consultants Giga, said the 20/20 program could diminish &quot;buyers remorse&quot; by among companies seeking to deploy push capabilities on internal networks by encouraging comparative testing.</p>
<p>Wayfarer is privately financed, with investors including Sequoia Capital, Hummer/Winblad Venture Partners, Robertson Stephens and Co., Bay Partners, and Stanford University. ((sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400))</p>
