<p>India's Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd said on Wednesday it had not heard so far from the government of the southern state of Tamil Nadu on the reopening of its smelter, closed because of a suspected gas leak.</p>
<p>M. Karunanidhi, chief minister of Tamil Nadu said on July 31 that the state government would decide on the reopening after examining the report of an expert committee within two days.</p>
<p>&quot;Now seven days have passed,&quot; K. Ranganathan, general manager (commercial) of Sterlite Industries, told Reuters by telephone from the southern port city of Tuticorin. &quot;No decision from them as yet. We are in the dark.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month, the firm was asked to shut operations at India's only private-sector copper smelter at Tuticorin after suspected gas emissions in which more than 100 workers in a nearby factory were reportedly hospitalised.</p>
<p>The company strongly denies the charge.</p>
<p>The state government set up an expert committee to examine the emissions.</p>
<p>Newspapers earlier this month quoted Karunanidhi as saying that the report submitted by the expert committee was &quot;not satisfactory&quot;.</p>
<p>The smelter, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes, began operations in December 1996.</p>
<p>Company officials have said that the closure was costing the company 25 million rupees daily.</p>
