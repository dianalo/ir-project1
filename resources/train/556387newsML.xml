<p>Swiss National Bank (SNB) board member Bruno Gehrig said recent growth in the SNB's money aggregate may reflect technical factors and he warned against hasty monetary changes based on minor fluctuations.</p>
<p>Gehrig, speaking to reporters after a speech here, said that the latest growth in the SNB's M0 was partly tied to a rise in notes in circulation.</p>
<p>&quot;Notes in circulation are subject to several factors, including institutional factors, which have no great significance in terms of monetary policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the rise may be due to several technical factors, adding that the increase was accompanied by a rise in large denomination notes, such as 1,000 franc notes.</p>
<p>He said this increase in large denomination bills in circulation could be related to investment practices.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see if we have a decline. We have institutional technical factors which reduce the meaning of the money aggregate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that overall, however, the SNB was not sure what reason exactly had led to the increase in notes in circulation.</p>
<p>&quot;It should warn us about immediately responding with monetary policy based on small changes in the money aggregate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Notes in circulation, as reported today in the SNB's 10-day statement, rose 659 million Swiss francs to 29.27 billion in the period ended April 30.</p>
<p>The SNB said in April that its M0 money aggregate grew on an annualised basis by 9.2 percent in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>In absolute terms the M0 averaged 32.48 billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p>M0 comprises sight deposits and notes in circulation. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340</p>
