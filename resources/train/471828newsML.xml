<p>It was not easy but Peruvian soldiers finally got peasant farmer Augusto Elguera to confess he was a Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebel.</p>
<p>But his sister, for one, is not buying it.</p>
<p>&quot;My brother's innocent,&quot; Hilda Elguera told Reuters. &quot;Soldiers grabbed him, made him pass out in water with gasoline and detergent, bloodied his fingers with needles and stuck electrical current in his anus, all to get him to sign a paper saying he is a terrorist.&quot;</p>
<p>Arrested on March 11 and now held at anti-terrorist police headquarters in Lima, Elguera is one of 38 people a local human rights group says were wrongly arrested and tortured when the army swept through villages in Peru's central jungle this month.</p>
<p>The eastern Andean jungle regions of Junin and Pasco departments are the last remaining MRTA strongholds in Peru -- except for the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima where about 20 rebels are holding 72 dignitaries in Latin America's longest-running hostage crisis ever.</p>
<p>The army, proudly announcing the capture of 38 &quot;MRTA terrorists&quot; and a small cache of arms, said recently its operation was conducted &quot;with complete respect for human rights.&quot; President Alberto Fujimori backed the army against the accusations, saying reports of rights abuses by soldiers were &quot;irresponsible&quot; and meant to discredit the armed forces.</p>
<p>SUCCESS VERSUS CRITICISM</p>
<p>&quot;One shouldn't try to discredit entities such as the police, the intelligence service and the armed forces, which have had such notable successes in the pacification of the country,&quot; Fujimori said.</p>
<p>Some analysts also remained sceptical of the reports, saying there was not enough proof to generalize that human rights were being abused and suggesting that residents of the towns had ulterior motives in claiming abuses by security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;It's known that in an area where there are not only rebels but also those linked to drug-trafficking the first way to stop these operations is by charging human rights violations,&quot; sociologist Raul Gonzales said.</p>
<p>But Elguera's relatives and others from the region some 220 miles (350 kms) east of Lima tell a very different story.</p>
<p>Karen Moali, the wife of detainee Jose Huaman, told how soldiers arrived in her village in early March and forced everyone to line up in the square while a hooded man pointed out supposed rebels. &quot;That was enough for them to take you away,&quot; she said. &quot;They didn't even ask for papers.&quot;</p>
<p>John Izurraga Soto, 15, was among those taken away by soldiers, who he claimed tried to force him to implicate others by sliding his body along the floor of a helicopter until half of it hung out over Peru's central jungle.</p>
<p>Other detainees told of beatings and forced confessions before being released from army custody.</p>
<p>Security forces had considered the MRTA, the smaller of Peru's two rebel groups, all but wiped out before a squad of rebels stormed the Japanese ambassador's Lima home on Dec. 17 and took hostage hundreds of cocktail party guests.</p>
<p>NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE</p>
<p>The rebels, who released most of their captives in the weeks following the takeover, are demanding the release of some 450 jailed comrades -- a demand Fujimori has rejected. The hostage-takers and the government held 10 rounds of talks before breaking off negotiations on March 12 in a flurry of accusations.</p>
<p>The human rights group Aprodeh denounced army abuses after residents arrived in Lima from Alto Yurinaki and other towns last week to report their complaints and ask for justice. &quot;Most of those detained are innocent, we have proof,&quot; Aprodeh President Francisco Soberon told Reuters. &quot;We question the (Defense Ministry's) communique because it has incongruities and falsehoods.&quot;</p>
<p>Rebels holed up in the diplomatic compound in Lima seized on the abuse reports to slam the government and, in the process, win a few propaganda points. &quot;The truth is that these are arbitrary and indiscriminate arrests by the Peruvian army of poor farmers who have nothing to do with our organisation,&quot; MRTA members said in a statement read over radio.</p>
<p>Still, most of the hostage-takers hail from the area and &quot;there is real concern for the fate of family and friends,&quot; the statement said. A local television station recently reported one man was shot to death by soldiers as he was trying to flee and showed a pot filled with soapy water and a large battery purportedly used by soldiers in jungle torture sessions.</p>
