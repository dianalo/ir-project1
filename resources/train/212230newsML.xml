<p>Voters in Niger cast their ballots for a new national assembly on Saturday but turnout was low with the West African nation's opposition boycotting the poll, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Opposition officials welcomed the trend but it was not immediately clear whether the mainly Moslem nation's voters were following the boycott call or just plain fed up with their sixth poll in four years.</p>
<p>Coupmaker-turned-president Ibrahim Bare Mainassara had urged a huge turnout and expressed regret that the opposition was not taking part.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the people of Niger will turn out massively to vote so we can extricate ourselves from this never-ending cycle of elections and devote ourselves to reviving the economy,&quot; he said after voting in the capital Niamey's town hall.</p>
<p>Opposition sources said the telephone lines of opposition leaders had been cut and the number of soldiers on guard near the home of ousted president Mahamane Ousmane was stepped up.</p>
<p>Unlike the chaotic July presidential election, which the opposition accused Mainassara of rigging, voting was very slow. Final turnout in July was 66.34 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The low turnout shows Niger cannot be governed without the opposition,&quot; leading opposition politician Bello Tiousso Garba told Reuters.</p>
<p>Like many of its neighbours in sub-Saharan Africa, Niger launched democratic reforms in the 1990s after the collapse of Communist rule in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians, including Mahamane, the elected civilian president Mainassara ousted in January, refused to register for Saturday's poll demanding that the result of the July presidential election be scrapped.</p>
<p>&quot;I regret this because I had hoped that all Niger citizens would rally round a consensus to organise this poll,&quot; Mainassara said.</p>
<p>Negotiations between the two sides collapsed after repeated extensions of the registration date with the opposition Front for the Restoration and Defence of Democracy standing by its demands, which also included reinstatement of a scrapped independent electoral commission.</p>
<p>In July, Mainassara suspended the commission on the second day of polling, accusing it of irregularities, and placed his opponents under house arrest. He appointed a new commission which declared him winner with 52.22 percent of votes cast.</p>
<p>The United States said the election was fraudulent and suspended development aid.</p>
<p>A total of 220 candidates from around a dozen parties were running for the 83-seat assembly, including the Union of Independents for Democratic Renewal which supports Mainassara.</p>
<p>Around 3.8 million people were eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Polls closed at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Electoral officials said provisional results, which the Supreme Court must verify, were expected within 24 hours.</p>
