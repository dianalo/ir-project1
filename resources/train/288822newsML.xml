<p>Ireland's Construction Industry Federation said on Monday that it expects growth of six percent in 1997 as the industry consolidates after producing a growth rate of 10 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;General contracting and civil engineering are both expected to grow by 10 percent and housing by one percent,&quot; CIF president Kevin Kelly said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last year saw growth of 19 percent in general contracting, six percent growth in civil engineering and 13 percent growth in housing, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the fact that the industry is performing strongly and is catching up after the slack of 1991-94,&quot; Kelly said. But he warned that investment in the economy generally must increase and be maintained at a higher level if Ireland's current rates of economic growth are to be maintained in the medium term.</p>
<p>The CIF said the construction industry will have created 20,000 jobs directly in the period between 1993 and 1997 as well as being responsible for another 10,000 indirect jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that at the outset of the new millennium, contingent on higher levels of investment and a continuity of present budgetary policy, construction will generate a further 15,000 new jobs,&quot; Kelly said.</p>
<p>But he called on the government to curtail the growth in state spending to ensure that the benefits of higher tax revenue resulting from economic growth are available to reduce the tax burden.</p>
<p>&quot;CIF members continue to be concerned with the rate of increase in public current expenditure. They consider that a far greater priority should be given to tax reform, particularly the employment tax wedge and the economy's investment needs,&quot; the CIF said.</p>
<p>The Irish construction industry represents 15 percent of GNP and accounts for 10 percent of total Irish employment, the CIF said.</p>
