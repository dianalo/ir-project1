<p>British-American Tobacco (BAT) Cambodia Ltd executives on Friday announced a $16-million factory upgrade aimed at increasing its share of the lucrative Cambodian market.</p>
<p>At a ceremony unveiling the plans, co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh told BAT officials and dignataries that the new leaf processing plant, high-speed machines and office facilities would further promote Cambodia's largely agrarian economy.</p>
<p>&quot;BAT's investment in the cigarette industry not only has resulted in job creation...it has also assisted Cambodian farmers,&quot; Ranariddh said. He said BAT has supplied seeds and technical assistance to farmers.</p>
<p>Corporate Affairs Manager Martin Riordan said the new facilities, expected to be completed within 12 months, would not increase capacity or the company's 730-person work force but improve quality and thus cut into the import market.</p>
<p>About half of Cambodia's smokers consume international brands, according to market analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage, we're...trying to improve the local brands and help them to be more popular, which will take the strain off imports,&quot; said Riordan.</p>
<p>There is intense competition for Cambodia's smokers, with 100 brands on the market here, according to industry analysts.</p>
<p>Riordan said BAT alone produces six billion local-brand cigarettes a year -- a third of the local market -- in a country of 10.5 million people.</p>
<p>BAT returned to Cambodia last June after a 22-year absence as lead stakeholder in a joint venture with formerly state-owned Cambodian Tobacco Co and Singapore-based SUTL Corporation, which assists in cigarette marketing and distribution.</p>
