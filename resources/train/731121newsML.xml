<p>Bangladesh expects to reach its food production target of more than 20 million tonnes despite forecasts of excess rain in 1997/98 (July-June), agricultural officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hopeful about achieving our crop target for the new year because of better management,&quot; Enamul Huq, Director General of the Department of Agriculture Extension, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the food production target of 20.4 million tonnes, the level achieved in 1996/97, was realistic. &quot;The target is achievable. We will strive for higher production,&quot; he said. Weather forecasters said Bangladesh was likely to have excessive rainfall this year, which could affect crops.</p>
<p>Sajedur Rahman, Director of the Meteorological Department, said 229 millimetres (nine inches) of rain were recorded over the past five days, about 48 percent of the monthly average of 477 mm (19 inches).</p>
<p>Bangladesh usually has 1,633 mm (64 inches) of monsoon rainfall from June to September, he said.</p>
<p>Rahman said heavy rains in northeast India, in the foothills of Himalayas and west of Bangladesh had caused the current floods.</p>
<p>&quot;Rainfall during this monsoon is expected to be above normal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Huq, however, said the rains had flooded only &quot;marginal land&quot; and had had little impact on food crops.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be a bad impact on the crops if it rains heavily or there is another flood in September,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Agriculture officials said excess rain might affect other crops such as tea and cotton.</p>
<p>The government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has allocated 3.26 billion taka ($74.7 million) in the 1997/98 (July-June) budget for subsidies to the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>&quot;This will bring down the cost of inputs like fertilizer and irrigation,&quot; one agriculture official said. Food ministry officials said Bangladesh expected to import 300,000 tonnes of rice and wheat to make up the expected annual shortfall in 1997/98. The country is likely to receive food aid worth $125 million in the year from international donors, they said.</p>
<p>Following are crop figures as available from the Agriculture department:</p>
<p>Rice: Production target of 18.9 million tonnes of three varieties of rice in 1997/98</p>
<p>Wheat: (November-March) - Target 1.5 million tonnes on 0.75 million hectares against previous harvest of 1.57 million tonnes on 0.71 million hectares.</p>
<p>Jute: (March-August) - Target of 7.42 million bales (181 kg each) on 0.55 million hectares against previous 7.3 million bales on 0.45 million hectares.</p>
<p>Sugarcane: Target 8.8 million tonnes on 160,000 hectares against previous 8.2 million on 160,000 hectares. Bangladesh imports about 120,000 tonnes of white sugar and produces nearly 200,000 tonnes annually.</p>
<p>Cotton: (August-January) Target 140,000 bales (181 kg each) of cotton on 60,000 hectares against previous 92,000 bales on 47,000 hectares.</p>
<p>Tea: Target 54 million kg of teas in calendar 1997 against 55.3 million kg in the previous year. Bangladesh plans to export about 30 million kg against 26.1 million in the past year.</p>
