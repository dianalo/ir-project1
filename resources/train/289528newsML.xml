<title>GERMANY: No wrongdoing seen at banks in German tycoon case.</title>
<headline>No wrongdoing seen at banks in German tycoon case.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Frankfurt prosecutor's office said on Monday there were no grounds to suspect wrongdoing by banks related to the collapse of former property tycoon Juergen Schneider's real estate empire in 1994.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, who earlier said they had charged Schneider with credit fraud and bankruptcy, told reporters that banks had allowed themselves to be deceived by Schneider, but there was no sign of internal wrongdoing at banks involved with him.  </p>
<p>Referring in particular to the example of Deutsche Bank AG, Schneider's biggest creditor, prosecutors said there was &quot;relatively little room to assume that banks .... shared the blame.&quot;</p>
<p>The 62-year-old Schneider, once one of Germany's most celebrated entrepreneurs, fell from grace when he and his wife Claudia vanished in April 1994, leaving their company to crumble under more than five billion marks ($3.2 billion) of debt.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Schneider had said at the weekend that the banks who supported their client shared the responsibility for the collapse of his business. There has been public outrage in Germany over the ease at which Schneider accessed credit.</p>
<p>Schneider has been held in a Frankfurt prison since he was extradited from Miami last February.</p>
<p>Claudia, who has been released from prison on health grounds, has also been charged with bankruptcy.</p>
