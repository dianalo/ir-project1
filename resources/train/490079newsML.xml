<p>Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters, is the only permanent venue for one of golf's four major championships.</p>
<p>The 6,925-yard, par-72 course, which has been constantly refined but rarely changed over the years, has been hosting the Masters since 1934.</p>
<p>Here is a brief hole-by-hole look at Augusta National (names in parentheses are derived from distinctive fauna found on each hole).</p>
<p>No. 1 (Tea Olive) par 4, 400 yards - From an elevated tee the player hits across a wide valley to an elevated fairway protected by deep bunker on the right. The green, the highest point on the course, has been slightly flattened this year, which should prevent putts from rolling off the green.</p>
<p>No. 2 (Pink Dogwood) par 5, 555 yards - Running downhill and curling to the left, this par five is reachable in two. The green is shallow but very wide, offering a variety of pin placements-- and some very long putts. Nick Faldo's 100-footer there is a Masters record.</p>
<p>No. 3 (Flowering Peach) par 4, 360 yards - While short, this uphill hole can be treacherous. Four bunkers in the left fairway enduce most players to drive with an iron. The triangular green is distinctly elevated and slopes from right to left, towards yet another bunker.</p>
<p>No. 4 (Flowering Crab Apple) par 3, 205 yards - The longest par three at Augusta features a big green that slopes severely downwards from the wide back to the narrow front, which is pinched between two deep bunkers. Ranked as the hardest hole last year.</p>
<p>No. 5 (Magnolia) par 4, 435 yards -  A long drive is needed to set up a reasonable approach to the turtle-backed green, which rises from among a series of mounds. Many players call it the hardest hole on the front nine, and some say it may be the toughest of all.</p>
<p>No. 6 (Juniper) par 3, 180 yards - From one of the highest spots on the course the players literally hit over spectators on the hillside below to a dangerous multi-leveled green sitting atop a plateau.</p>
<p>No. 7 (Pampas) par 4, 360 yards - Augusta's shortest par four looks easy, but it demands one of the most challenging second shots in championship golf. The small, highly elevated green is encircled by five bunkers and is effectively divided by a ridge running from back to front.</p>
<p>No. 8 (Yellow Jasmine) par 5, 535 yards - This hole is uphill almost all the way, and often into the wind, making it play a lot longer than it measures. The narrow green, protected by enormous mounds at the left front, is one of the toughest at Augusta.</p>
<p>No. 9 (Carolina Cherry) par 4, 435 yards - Any drive leaves a downhill lie for the shot to a highly elevated, three-level green. If the hole is cut towards the front, a player's approach can spin back onto the fairway -- as Greg Norman's did last year.</p>
<p>No. 10 (Camellia) par 4, 485 yards - The drive is key on this long par four -- the same length as the par-five 13th -- which sweeps down from the hilltop clubhouse. The gigantic green, often made more difficult by tree shadows, has produced a surprising number of four-putts over the years.</p>
<p>No. 11 (White Dogwood) par 4, 455 yards - The last three Masters playoffs were decided at this long par four -- the first of three holes comprising &quot;Amen Corner.&quot; The approach from a fairway high above the hole must avoid a pond at the left front of the big green.</p>
<p>No. 12 (Golden Bell) par 3, 155 yards - One of the most famous holes in golf, this short par three, protected by Rea's Creek in front, has broken the hearts of many would-be champions. The green is extremely shallow and a gigantic stand of pine trees behind it makes the wind -- and therefore club selection -- very difficult to judge.</p>
<p>No. 13 (Azalea) par 5, 485 yards - This famed par five is a clsssic &quot;risk and reward&quot; hole. It is certainly short enough to reach in two well played shots but a deep creek in front of the green awaits weak efforts and three putts cannot be ruled out on the enormous green.</p>
<p>No. 14 (Chinese Fir) par 4, 405 yards - This short hole does not have even one hazard, but it can be deadly. The odd-shaped green is so undulating that it is hard to put an approach in the right position and easy to three-putt, even from short distances.</p>
<p>No. 15 (Fire Thorn) par 5, 500 yards - This is another par- five &quot;decision&quot; hole. Ever since Gene Sarazen made his famous double eagle (albatross) in 1935, it has been one of the most dramatic holes at Augusta. It could be even more fun this year. The front left green has been flattened, allowing for a new, dangerous pin placement close to the pond that fronts the green.</p>
<p>No. 16 (Redbud) par 3, 170 yards - One of the most popular spectator holes, this par three has a big, sloping green guarded by a pond front left and three deep bunkers to the right and rear. The contour of the green can create some huge breaks in putts.</p>
<p>No. 17 (Nandina) par 4, 400 yards - Although the famous Eisenhower Pine guards the left side of the fairway, the real trouble is the three-tiered green, which demands a precise approach to avoid three-putting.</p>
<p>No. 18 (Holly) par 4, 405 yards - Trees on the right and bunkers on the left make the drive crucial on this familiar finishing hole, which is uphill all the way. The deep green -- always surrounded by thousands of people -- is flanked by bunkers and slopes severely.</p>
