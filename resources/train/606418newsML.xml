<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 22------------------</p>
<p>Copper is expected to hold around $2,500 a tonne on Thursday and could attempt to probe higher if the market can overcome its overbought condition, traders and chartists said.</p>
<p>Aluminium may have to ease back towards support at $1,637 to spark fresh upside sentiment, they added.  </p>
<p>COPPER - Looking to move higher towards $2,540 after consolidating around $2,500 but market operators are showing concern about the market's overbought condition.</p>
<p>The 14-day RSI at 78 percent is helping to cap probes higher.</p>
<p>&quot;...traders are more concerned about copper's inability to roar higher and a possible overbought situation than anything else,&quot; GNI said in their daily commodity report.</p>
<p>But with fundamentals remaining strong and threats of production disruptions in both North and South America, several traders and analysts suggest that the market will move to attack upside resistance. According to Harry Creates of AMT a breach of $2,518 targets the November uptrend resistance at $2,545.</p>
<p>On the downside copper is likely to find bands of stiff resistance.</p>
<p>Martin Squires of LME brokers Rudolf Wolff said support is placed between $2,480 and $24,90.</p>
<p>Creates of AMT targeted support at $2,462.</p>
<p>At 0645 GMT three months LME copper was quoted at $2,500/2,505, against London's late close of $2,503/05.  </p>
<p>ALUMINIUM - Despite strengthening premiums prices are expected to correct lower and build a base before attacking higher levels, traders and chartwatchers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The technical indicators remain weak as we continue to feel that aluminium is in need of a corrective pull-back or at least a period Of consolidation,&quot; Squires of Rudolf Wolff said.</p>
<p>Squires placed support at $1,634/37 followed by $1,616.</p>
<p>Gerald metals said selling back to the $1,620/30 support area may be what the market needs to generate fresh buying to challenge the $1,700 level.</p>
<p>Creates of AMT placed a block of resistance up to $1,678, while he pegged support at $1,646 followed by $1,637.</p>
<p>At 0655 GMT aluminium was indicated at $1,652/55, versus $1,653/55.</p>
