<title>FRANCE: France to privatise nuclear group Framatome soon.</title>
<headline>France to privatise nuclear group Framatome soon.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>France is set to privatise nuclear group Framatome soon and Alcatel Alsthom is set to obtain a long sought-after majority stake in the company, Industry Minister Franck Borotra said on Friday.</p>
<p>Britain's General Electric Co Plc and Germany's Siemens could also join in the ownership of the nuclear engineering company, he added in an interview with afternoon daily Le Monde.</p>
<p>Borotra also said he wanted to form a strong French mining group from nuclear materials group Cogema, nickel miner Eramet and geological survey group BRGM.</p>
<p>On Monday, Framatome said that merger talks with GEC Alsthom had failed after many months of discussions.</p>
<p>Alcatel, which has a 44 percent stake in Framatome and a 50 percent stake in the GEC Alsthom venture with GEC, had wanted to combine the two groups.</p>
<p>But while all parties were convinced about the logic and advantages of such a deal, there was a deadlock because the French government wanted French interests to have a majority in the new group while GEC did not want to go below 50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is favourable to an eventual alliance between Framatome and Alcatel Alsthom in its energy activites, with GEC joining up afterwards,&quot; Borotra told Le Monde.</p>
<p>&quot;We have decided not to close the door and to look for another kind of agreement. This alliance has industrial reasons which remain valid. We have not found the right construction (of a deal). We will have to look at others,&quot; Borotra said.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be other partners but in the first instance we will have to study all possibilities with the two preferred partners that we have today,&quot; Borotra said.</p>
<p>&quot;One possibility would be to go via Alcatel Alsthom,&quot; he added. Borotra said that he wanted Framatome to be privatised and be part of a strong group &quot;the faster the better&quot;.</p>
<p>But, he stressed, the government &quot;would not abandon its desire to keep its control of the nuclear domain&quot;.</p>
<p>Asked about a role for Siemens, he said &quot;Because we want to keep Framatome at the world top level, we will continue to cooperate with the Germans. Whether that would lead to a stake, I know nothing about it but I do not exclude anything,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Alcatel has for a number of years tried unsuccessfully to obtain permission to increase its stake in Framatome to a majority. The other shareholders are state groups CEA Industrie, Electricite de France (EDF) and Consortium de Realisation (CDR).</p>
<p>But the government and former Framatome head Jean-Claude Leny did not want Alcatel to get a majority because it could endanger Framatome's cooperation with Siemens.</p>
<p>His successor Dominique Vignon is however more open to an alliance with Alcatel. Framatome said earlier this week that it was in no hurry to strike a deal.</p>
<p>A privatisation of Framatome, with 1996 net income at 894 million francs on sales of 15.2 billion, could help the state reduce its debt burden.</p>
<p>A straight sale of a stake to Alcatel which would give the industrial group overall control would be in line with the latter's long held wishes but could be less straightforward than it seems.</p>
<p>Alcatel, recovering from a record 1995 loss with a shock restructuring programme, is also in the running to bid for the state's 56 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>Lagardere Groupe is the only other allowed bidder after the government ruled GEC could not bid.</p>
<p>GEC is talking to Alcatel and Lagardere about joining in a Thomson-CSF operations. And GEC is also talking to Alcatel about their relationship in the GEC Alsthom industrial power and high-speed train venture.</p>
