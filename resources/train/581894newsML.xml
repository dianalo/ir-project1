<title>CANADA: Gandalf sees possible equity financing.</title>
<headline>Gandalf sees possible equity financing.</headline>
<dateline>OTTAWA 1997-05-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gandalf Technologies Inc said on Wednesday it expected to meet its financing needs this quarter and that it was also considering an alliance or a merger.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to conclude our financing needs this quarter and while we are keeping our options open, it will likely be in the form of equity financing, probably using some type of convertible instrument,&quot; Chief Executive Richard Busto told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gandalf said on Wednesday that at the end of March it defaulted on some loan facilities provided by the Royal Bank of Canada. Gandalf said it also advised the bank that it would have to borrow funds exceeding its unstated margin account.</p>
<p>Gandalf said it received a letter from the bank in April &quot;tolerating the defaults&quot; and reduced Gandalf's credit facilities to C$13 million from C$20 million.</p>
<p>However, based on ongoing discussions, Gandalf said the bank appeared to be supportive of Gandalf's continued restructuring efforts.</p>
<p>Gandalf said on Wednesday it has hired brokerages J.P. Morgan and RBC Dominion Securities to search for strategic alliances or a merger.</p>
<p>The company also said on Wednesday that its fourth quarter losses grew to US$18.8 million or US$0.43 a share in the three months ended March 31, which included a restructuring cost of US$8.4 million.</p>
<p>In the same quarter a year ago, Gandalf posted a profit of US$67,000 and broke even on a per-share basis.</p>
<p>Gandalf has reduced its staff by 100 employees since January 1997 and expects to lay off at least another 50 to 60 workers to reach a goal of less than 500 employees, Busto said.</p>
<p>Gandalf's share price jumped nearly 150 percent on Tuesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), but Busto had no explanation for the sharp rise.</p>
<p>&quot;It's something that happened in the market,&quot; Busto said.</p>
<p>The stock gave up some of its gains on Wednesday, falling 1.04 to close at 2.44 on the TSE.</p>
<p>On Nasdaq, shares dropped 12/16 to close at 1-13/16.</p>
