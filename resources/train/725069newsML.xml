<p>Ethiopia's Olympic 10,000 metres champion and world record holder Haile Gebrselassie said on Monday he would not participate in next month's world championships in Athens because the track was too hard.</p>
<p>&quot;I completed the Atlanta Olympics 10,000 metres event suffering great injuries with blood flowing from my soles. It took me a long time to recover from that injury and I do not want to undergo similar sufferings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gebrselassie said he decided to withdraw after hearing the Athens track was similar to the one used in Atlanta, which he said favoured sprinters at the expense of distance runners.</p>
<p>An Ethiopian Athletic Federation official said he was unaware of Gebrselassie's decision. &quot;As far as we are concerned, Haile is among the 24 Ethiopian athletes selected for the Athens games and he is participating in training without fail,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>Gebrselassie denied he was missing Athens to prepare for more lucrative grand prix events.</p>
<p>Ethiopia must now look to women runners like Gete Wami and Derartu Tulu for medals in Athens.</p>
