<p>Mexico's former Attorney General Antonio Lozano Gracia on Tuesday denied insinuations he had planted a body in the ranch of ex-president Carlos Salinas' brother Raul, and claimed he was the victim of a political lynching.</p>
<p>Breaking a long silence a week after prosecutors suggested his men paid a reputed witch to plant evidence against Raul Salinas, Lozano sought to turn the spotlight back onto the former president's brother, currently in jail on murder charges.</p>
<p>Lozano admitted he authorised payments to the witch, known as La Paca, who in October 1996 led Lozano's investigators to a body buried in the ranch on the outskirts of Mexico City. But he suggested that was more a mistake than an attempt to pervert justice.</p>
<p>Instead, he urged investigators to follow up testimony from the witch that she had been threatened by Raul Salinas and ordered to bury the body in order to discredit investigations against him.</p>
<p>At the time of its discovery, Lozano's team suggested the body may have belonged to a congressman who is believed to have plotted the 1994 murder of a top politician with Raul but went missing shortly after. Many Mexicans immediately jumped to the conclusion that Raul had double-crossed him.</p>
<p>But after Lozano was fired in December, a new team of investigators announced the body was not that of the congressman, saying instead it belonged to a dead Mexican man robbed from his grave and re-buried at the ranch by the witch and her cronies.</p>
<p>Why La Paca carried out the bizarre act is a question that has the Mexican public baffled.</p>
<p>Prosecutors vaguely suggested Lozano's men may have ordered her to plant the body to strengthen the case against Salinas, who Lozano jailed two years ago on charges of ordering the murder of ruling party secretary general Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu.</p>
<p>Those insinuations were bolstered by the disappearance of Lozano's right-hand man, special investigator Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, wanted for questioning on why he made the payments to La Paca.</p>
<p>Lozano flatly denied that line of speculation and called on Chapa to come out of hiding. &quot;The attorney general's office paid no one to plant the corpse,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said he authorised payments to La Paca as a normal practice to procure witnesses during an investigation. But he sidestepped questions as to why those payments were made before the identity of the corpse was determined. &quot;Certainly, there were some errors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Instead he sought to give a political slant to the insinuations against him, that he described as a &quot;lynching.&quot;</p>
<p>Lozano, who belongs to the National Action Party, was the only member of the opposition ever to hold a cabinet post. With mid-term congressional elections scheduled for July, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has capitalised on his bungled case against Salinas to discredit his party.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not accept nor am I disposed to tolerate the fraudulent way the information has been handled and twisted,&quot; Lozano said. &quot;I fear that the object of this campaign and these acts of authority have political roots,&quot; he said.</p>
