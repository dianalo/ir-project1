<p>A Peruvian congressman who was held captive inside the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima played down speculation on Wednesday that Cuba might offer asylum for the Marxist hostage takers.</p>
<p>&quot;I was in the same room as the Cuban ambassador and witnessed no special contact, no talks,&quot; opposition legislator Javier Diez Canseco told Reuters.</p>
<p>Cuban Ambassador Pedro Diaz and deputy chief of mission Jose Raul Silva were eventually released by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas as a Christmas goodwill gesture on Sunday night along with 223 other captives. Diez Canseco was set free on Friday.</p>
<p>Rumours that Havana would offer safe passage to about 20 Cuban-inspired rebels still holding 105 VIP hostages at the residence were fuelled on Wednesday by Japanese press reports hinting that a deal had been worked out.</p>
<p>Tokyo quickly denied it was the source of the speculation and Japan's task force in Lima said it &quot;has not confirmed any such information.&quot;</p>
<p>But interest in the possible Cuba solution refused to die down in diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is the best option now, but I don't have any evidence that it's even yet become a serious option,&quot; said one U.S. official in Lima, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Opposition legislator Fernando Olivera, who did not attend the December 17 diplomatic reception stormed by guerrillas, said on Monday that he had received information that Lima and Havana had agreed on a solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>But Diez Canseco said Cuba would risk further international isolation if it received the gunmen. &quot;It would be very hard for Cuba to accept them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Apart from confirming that two Cuban diplomats were being held in the residence and were later freed, Havana has been careful to make no comment on the hostage drama, neither applauding nor criticising the MRTA rebels.</p>
<p>There were no officials at the Cuban embassy in Lima on Wednesday, a security guard said.</p>
<p>Cuban leader Fidel Castro played a key role last June between the Colombian government and leftist guerrillas to secure the release of the kidnapped brother of Cesar Gaviria, the country's former president who is now secretary general of the Organisation of American States.</p>
<p>The MRTA rebels have said they will not free their remaining captives, who include top Peruvian government officials, Japanese businessmen and the brother of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, unless the government frees about 400 of their jailed comrades.</p>
<p>Fujimori has flatly rejected the MRTA demands.</p>
