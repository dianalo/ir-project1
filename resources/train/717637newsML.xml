<p>Yasuo Hamanaka, the former star Sumitomo Corp. trader who once dominated world copper markets, said at his trial on Wednesday that fear of dismissal made him hide mammoth trading losses in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>According to Tokyo prosecutors, Hamanaka and his former boss at Sumitomo Corp., Saburo Shimizu, began unauthorised trading in London Metal Exchange futures in 1985 to sustain the copper division's profitability after it recorded its first profit in 10 years.</p>
<p>But the team instead incurred trading losses, which the two hid through off-the-book deals. By the time Shimizu quit the company in 1987 and Hamanaka took over as Sumitomo's copper team leader, their losses had climbed to $57.5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;When Mr. Shimizu resigned from the company, he was so exhausted and had lost his energy to keep trading. I had no choice but to take over the losses,&quot; Hamanaka told a Tokyo court.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had confessed to the losses to the management then, I would have been demoted or dismissed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Once nicknamed &quot;Mr. Five Percent&quot; and &quot;Mr. Copper&quot; for his influence in the global copper market, Hamanaka was fired in June 1996 for his role in one of the biggest trading scandals in history.</p>
<p>He has already pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and forgery in connection with unauthorised trades that Sumitomo says amounted to $2.6 billion in losses by the time he was dimissed.</p>
<p>Despite the guilty plea, his defence lawyers have said they hope to achieve a light sentence by demonstrating that lax controls at Sumitomo were partly to blame for the huge losses.</p>
