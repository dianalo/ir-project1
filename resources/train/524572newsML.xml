<headline>Dollar/yen seen range-bound in Asia, eyes on mark.</headline>

<p>The dollar is expected to be range-bound against the yen in Asia on Tuesday, with dollar/yen moves likely to be largely influenced by dollar/mark and mark/yen trade after renewed strength of the mark overnight.</p>
<p>Traders are expected to remain reluctant to take heavy dollar long positions ahead of a U.S.-Japan bilateral meeting and the Group of Seven meeting this weekend, but the dollar is expected to be supported near and just below 125 yen with bids from Japanese importers and some investors, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no fresh factors in dollar/yen trade alone,&quot; said a dealer at a trust bank.  </p>
<p>He added that he would closely watch mark moves since overall trade had been moving in connection with mark strength recently.</p>
<p>Overnight, the dollar was dragged down by the overall strength of the mark against European counterparts due to renewed pessimism about European economic and monetary union after a surprise announcement of a French general election.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac, saying France needed to join a single European currency from a position of strength, dissolved the National Assembly on Monday and called an early parliamentary election for May 25 and June 1.  </p>
<p>Although EMU-related news overnight may not have a substantial impact in Asian trading time, dealers said they would focus on possible mark-related comments from a symposium on European Monetary Union in Tokyo, hosted by the Institute for International Monetary Affairs. Bundesbank vice-president Johann-Wilhelm Gaddum will attend the symposium.</p>
<p>Although a city bank dealer said the dollar/mark may take a breather after dipping below 1.70 marks overnight, the trust bank dealer said a further fall in the dollar/mark was possible, which could also push dollar/yen rates down further below 125 yen.  </p>
<p>Dealers said that in crosses the mark may rise further against the yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Some traders still have short mark/yen positions, so the mark could rise above 74 yen in Tokyo,&quot; the trust bank dealer said.</p>
<p>But the city bank dealer said exporter sales may emerge above 74 yen, keeping the mark's topside heavy.</p>
