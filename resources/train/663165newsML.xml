<p>The Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) on Monday signed two loan agreements worth a total of $100 million to boost cooperation between Hungary and the Nordic countries, financial officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are certain that it will open new possibilites of cooperation between the Nordic countries and Hungary,&quot; Jon Sigurdsson, President and CEO of NIB, told a news conference.</p>
<p>One loan worth $50 million will enable NIB to participate in the financing of large projects both in the public and private sectors, a statement said.</p>
<p>Sigurdsson added energy, environmental protection, telecommunications, transportation and cooperation in industrial investments were potential areas for aid, with particular focus on municipal infrastructure.</p>
<p>The other loan, also worth $50 million, was signed with state owned development bank Magyar Fejlesztesi Bank Rt (MFB) for a programme targeted at the financing of small and medium sized projects of mutual interest to Hungary and the Nordic states.</p>
<p>NIB, founded in 1995, is owned by Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and Norway, and finances projects of common interest within the Nordic region and international investment projects of mutual interest to the customer country and the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>MFB is primarily responsible for the financial implementation of the government's economic programme.</p>
