<p>The French debt market and the franc tumbled further on Monday, extending last week's losses, ahead of a snap general election expected to be called later in the evening by President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>Analysts said there could be further losses on Tuesday and forecast that French financial markets would remain volatile until the parliamentary elections were over.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is going to depend on opinion polls -- whether Chirac looks like keeping his (centre-right) majority or not,&quot; said CCF economist Antoine Brunet.</p>
<p>The two-round vote, nine months ahead of schedule, was expected to be held on May 25 and June 1 or June 1 and June 8.  </p>
<p>Economists were, in the main, optimistic that Chirac's gamble would pay off, giving him a free hand to introduce fresh austerity measures to allow France to qualify for European monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;I think markets will recognise that he has chosen his timing wisely, that he would not have gone to the electorate if he did not believe he would win,&quot; said Stuart Thomson of Banque Indosuez, noting that snap parliamentary elections were unusual in France.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he said he believed that markets would display a &quot;precautionary weakness&quot; until the vote was over.  </p>
<p>The 10-year bond future lost 44 basis points to settle at 128.28. PIBOR was also badly hit, losing 19 basis points to 96.30. The franc, however, suffered the most, falling more than half a centime against the mark to 3.3769 from 3.3696 on Friday, its lowest level since March.</p>
<p>Analysts said there could be further weakness on Tuesday, although they said the election call was now in the prices. &quot;It's practically a given that Jacques Chirac will dissolve the national assembly,&quot; he said. French markets were protected to a certain extent by the fact foreigners have already sold off so much of their French bond holdings, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Foreign investors are a very small part of the French financial markets and the domestic investors have a better understanding of the French political system,&quot; said one economist. Recent figures showed just 12 percent of outstanding French government notes and bonds were in foreign hands.</p>
<p>Analysts said that there could be considerable upside for the French markets if voters delivered the centre-right government another majority. But any sign in the polls that Chirac might have miscalculated and that &quot;the next government would be a coalition of Socialists, Communists and ecologists would be very negative,&quot; said one economist.</p>
