<p>President Bill Clinton may use his veto powers to block efforts in Congress to reverse his certification of Mexico's anti-drug efforts, the White House said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The president feels very strongly on the subject of decertification,&quot; White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said, adding &quot;that includes the possibility of a veto.&quot;  </p>
<p>White House officials said they expected the House of Representatives to pass a resolution Thursday that would reverse Clinton's certification of Mexico's drug fighting efforts -- forcing the administration to focus on the Senate to back language more acceptable to Clinton.</p>
<p>&quot;We look closely at what the Senate considers,&quot; McCurry told reporters, noting that &quot;decertification would send a signal to the government of Mexico that could conceivably be interpreted negatively.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The president had made quite clear his strong views on certification and that could be strong enough to include the possibility of a veto,&quot; McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>Clinton planned to meet later Wednesday with a group of senators invited to the White House to discuss the certification issue.</p>
