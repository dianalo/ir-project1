<title>JAPAN: Dollar/yen seen softer in range-bound trade.</title>
<headline>Dollar/yen seen softer in range-bound trade.</headline>

<p>The dollar is likely to soften against the yen in Asia on Thursday ahead of the release of U.S. April international trade data and the G7 summit in Denver starting on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Interbank traders are likely to take fresh short positions at around 113.50 yen on the back of Japanese exporter selling orders above that point, but the downside could be also limited at around 112.80 yen due to buying interest from Japanese institutional investors.</p>
<p>&quot;The market lacks energy to move out of its recent trading band,&quot; said a dealer at a city bank.  </p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was to leave Japan for Denver on Thursday and to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton later in the day.</p>
<p>Currency dealers said that although the leaders may discuss Japan's rising trade surplus, they did not expect any specifics to come out of the meeting.</p>
<p>A dealer at a trust bank dealer said any dollar rise would be limited as Japan was likely to come under pressure at the summit to stimulate its domestic demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Downward pressure on the dollar will probably persist,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Wednesday that it was &quot;very important&quot; that Japan achieve domestic demand-led growth and avoid a sustained increase in its trade surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's very important for the world that that objective be met,&quot; Rubin told public television's Nightly Business Report.</p>
<p>The trust bank dealer said that some Japanese exporters had apparently lowered their offers to below 114 yen. Stop-loss buying orders were seen in place at around 113.80 yen and 114.20 yen. But a larger amount of stop-loss sales, including options-related ones, was seen in place on the downside.  </p>
<p>Economists expect the U.S. trade deficit to have widened to $10.0 billion in April, following at $8.51 billion gap in March. A large increase in the U.S. deficit with Japan would put downward pressure on the dollar/yen ahead of the summit.</p>
<p>The data is due at 0830 EDT (1230 GMT) on Thursday.</p>
<p>However, the city bank dealer said that concerns over the U.S.-Japan trade issue had been factored into the market and were unlikely to push the dollar below 110 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar is likely to be capped between 1.7350 and 1.7400 marks, partly on talk of offers from European central banks.</p>
