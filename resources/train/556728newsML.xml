<p>Anglo-Dutch foods and consumer products group Unilever NV/plc posted a seven percent rise in first quarter profits to 538 million pounds ($873.2 million) on Friday, driven by stronger sales in the Far East and higher margin sales of perfume in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had to highlight two particular factors it would be the margin improvement in Europe and the big increase at operating level from southeast Asia,&quot; said Unilever press officer Mike Haines.</p>
<p>The company posted a 16 percent increase in its first quarter trading profits before exceptionals to 661 million pounds.</p>
<p>This was after much higher than forecast exceptional charges of 76 million pounds, up from 15 million, mainly due to changes at its foods businesses in Europe including a charge for a head office closure in Bristol.</p>
<p>Unilever Plc shares were 10-1/2 pence higher at 1636p at midday after a stronger than forecast rise in underlying profits after exceptionals.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason is that the market has looked at the operating profit before exceptional items and seen that it is up 16 percent and has then looked at how margins have improved in Europe,&quot; said Paribas analyst John Campbell.</p>
<p>Europe was Unilever's star performer with profits up 106 million pounds to 360 million. Although sales rose just one percent, margins improved 2.6 percent to 9.4 percent.</p>
<p>Margins were helped also by a pensions benefit and the absence of a write-off of 14 million pounds due to the beef crisis in the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Europe benefited especially from increased sales of personal products driven by deodorants like Lynx in Britain and perfumes after the launch of cKbe in several countries and the roll out of Elizabeth Arden Fifth Avenue outside Britain, said Haines.</p>
<p>The exceptionally warm weather over Easter boosted ice cream and deodorant sales, he said.</p>
<p>Unilever's Asia-Pacific business showed a 17 million pound increase in trading profit to 107 million with a strong performance from Thailand and the Philippines on sales of Unilever's home and personal care products, said Haines.</p>
<p>Sales of detergents Viso and Haso in Vietnam grew while India put in a very strong performance. After a difficult period Australia showed good sales growth in personal care products, he added.</p>
<p>But profits in North America fell by 11 percent as foods and prestige businesses made a slow start to the year after a strong end to 1996. In Latin America, trading profits were affected by increased marketing investment and higher costs in Brazil.</p>
<p>The contribution to group profits from Africa and the Middle East almost halved to 17 million pounds due to a decline in sales after a major shake-up of distribution in Turkey.</p>
<p>At constant rates of exchange sales increased by five percent to 7.988 billion pounds. At current rates of exchange, net profit fell eight percent in sterling to 296 million, reflecting the relative strength of the British currency, but increased by 11 percent in Dutch guilders.</p>
<p>Net debt was 1.905 billion pounds at the end of the quarter, down almost 900 million pounds due to a much better cashflow from the group's operations.</p>
