<headline>UK Labour fails to assure on tax, spending - poll.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's opposition Labour Party has failed to impress voters with recent promises to hold public spending at current levels and not to raise income tax if it wins the next election, the Guardian said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>An opinion poll conducted by ICM for the newspaper showed 60 percent of voters believed a Labour government would raise spending, while only 25 percent believed it would maintain income tax rates.</p>
<p>With a general election due by May, the poll showed Labour's lead over the ruling Conservative Party had shrunk by one percentage point to 16 percent compared with a month ago.</p>
<p>If the election were held now, Labour would win 48 percent of the vote, the Conservatives 32 percent and the Liberal Democrats 15 percent, the Guardian said.</p>
<p>Labour's score was the same as a month ago, while the Conservatives went up by one percentage point and the Liberal Democrats lost one, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The poll's result follows a recent Labour campaign aimed at shaking off its image of being a big spending, tax raising party.</p>
<p>ICM interviewed 1,119 adults by telephone between January 31 and February 2. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
