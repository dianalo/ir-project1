<p>Mexico's stock market is likely to see only limited turbulence in the months ahead of key mid-term elections in July, said Robert Pelosky, the head of Latin American equity strategy for Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>&quot;The surprise could be that the market rides through this period pretty okay...with limited volatility, down five to seven, eight percent,&quot; Pelosky said during an interview with Reuters.  </p>
<p>Conventional wisdom in Wall Street so far this year has been to buy Mexican stocks early in the year and sell in the second quarter, ahead of the July poll, Pelosky said during an interview with Reuters.  &quot;It's a little too cute to think everyone can sell in April and buy back in August...that typically doesn't happen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mexicans will elect a new Congress and, for the first time ever, a mayor of Mexico City.  The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) is expected to face its toughest challenge yet to its 67-year grip on power and many Mexicans fear the country could witness political upheaval.  </p>
<p>Mexican stocks have gained nearly 10 percent in nominal terms so far this year on hopes the economy is finally recovering from the 1994-1995 peso crisis.  But many local brokerage firms are bracing for a market correction.</p>
<p>One cloud on the horizon for Pelosky is low real interest rates in Mexico that could worsen any correction. Rates on Mexico's one-year Cetes, or T-bills, stand at 25.68 percent, compared with expected 1997 inflation of about 17 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The lower interest rates go now, the greater risk of volatility,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, lower interest rates could cause local investors to shift their money from fixed-income securities to equity and help bring new liquidity to the Bolsa, he added.</p>
