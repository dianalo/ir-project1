<p>The emergency on the Mir orbiting space station showed vividly on Thursday that the U.S. and Russian astronauts aboard come from different worlds.</p>
<p>Hours after the space station Mir, manned by Michael Foale, Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin, collided with a cargo craft on Wednesday, the western media was hunting -- and getting -- personal details of the NASA astronaut.</p>
<p>The Russian public however was kept on a strict diet of official biographies which gave only the barest career record and space experience of airforce colonel Tsibliyev, 43, and researcher Lazutkin, 39.</p>
<p>British-born Foale, 40, is married with two children and holds British and American citizenships.</p>
<p>&quot;I've dreamt of being an astronaut since I was six, when my American grandpa showed me the John Glenn capsule at a State Fair in Minnesota,&quot; Britain's Daily Telegraph quoted him as saying before the start of the Mir mission in May.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, I've had a foot in England and a foot in America for most of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>In June 1983 he joined the NASA Johnson Space Center and was selected as an astronaut candidate in June 1987. In 1992 he made his first space flight with the shuttle Atlantis and his second aboard Discovery in 1993.</p>
<p>In 1995 Foale was a member of a joint Russian-U.S. crew on Discovery, which came as close as 11 metres (33 feet) to the Mir but did not dock.</p>
<p>Foale has admitted he needed his boarding-school experience in the medieval King's School in Canterbury to face Mir.</p>
<p>&quot;Life on board Mir is cramped with no personal privacy,&quot; he told Daily Telegraph. &quot;The food is rotten and there are no women but after a couple of days you get used to it. Just the same as school.&quot;</p>
<p>Foale's parents showed traditionally British stiff upper lips on hearing of the Mir collision.</p>
<p>His father, Colin, said the ageing ship should not be blamed and joint U.S.-Russian flights continued.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an enormous admiration for the Russian achievement with Mir,&quot; he told U.S. ABC television. &quot;This mishap has got nothing to do with age and I think we ought to retain our perspective of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Attempts to find more information about the Russian members of the Mir crew in Moscow were thwarted by the same kind of secrecy that surrounded space programme problems during the Soviet era.</p>
<p>Crew commander Tsibliyev graduated from an airforce academy in 1975 and logged more than 1,500 hours as an air force pilot before joining the space programme in 1987.</p>
<p>He made his first space flight of 197 days in 1993, including five spacewalks totalling 19 hours.</p>
<p>The Mir mission was the first for Lazutkin, a graduate of Moscow's elite Aviation Institute, who had worked for the Energia company, a leading producer of rocket boosters in the former Soviet Union between 1984 and 1994.</p>
<p>In 1994 he moved to Star City outside Moscow as a cadet of the space training centre.</p>
