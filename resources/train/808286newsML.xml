<p>Three Russian peacekeepers serving in the former Soviet republic of Georgia have been taken hostage, the Russian embassy said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Embassy spokesman Aleksei Savinski said that two officers and one soldier had been taken captive by Georgian gunmen near the town of Rukhi, in a security zone between Georgia and its breakaway province of Abkhazia.</p>
<p>The 1,500-strong Russian peacekeeping force patrols a buffer zone between Georgia and Abkhazia. The two sides fought a bloody ethnic conflict in 1992-93. Abkhazia has run itself as a de facto independent state ever since but has not gained international recognition.</p>
<p>Tamaz Nadarishvili, head of the former Georgian-installed government in Abkhazia now in exile, said the hostage-takers were demanding the bodies of two Georgians he claimed had been killed by Abkhaz police units on the Abkhaz side of the buffer zone.</p>
<p>He gave the surnames of the two dead men as Gagua and Bodzhgua but disclosed no further details.</p>
<p>Violent incidents are common in the security zone and both the Russian peacekeepers and the Abkhaz blame Georgian sabotage groups for a spate of mine-laying incidents and other armed attacks. The Georgian government says it has no control over the groups.</p>
<p>Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has vowed to regain control over Abkhazia but he and separatist leader Vladislav Ardzinba signed a joint declaration last week disavowing the use of force to resolve the issue.</p>
