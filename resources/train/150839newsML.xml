<p>The leaders of Italy's two biggest parties on Tuesday discussed how to proceed with constitutional reform but said that the political climate was unlikely to allow any progress until next year.</p>
<p>Massimo D'Alema, head of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), told reporters after meeting centre-right leader Silvio Berlusconi that parliament should finish the 1997 budget before setting up a planned bicameral commission to draft reforms.</p>
<p>D'Alema, whose ex-communist party is the biggest in Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, said that to push ahead with a vote on the commission amid fierce opposition to the government's budget would be a &quot;surreal situation&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think it (the vote) should take place immediately, but after the clash in progress over the budget,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, who leads the Forza Italia party and was prime minister for seven months in 1994, said Tuesday's meeting had been &quot;positive because it opens a way to solving the problem of modernising the country&quot;.</p>
<p>He told reporters he did not think the differences between right and left were insuperable but then added: &quot;There are situations which do not give rise to enthusiasm. The climate is no longer the most suitable to think of rebuilding the house.&quot;</p>
<p>Gianfranco Fini, leader of the far-right National Alliance was less upbeat. He said: &quot;There are differences. And how!&quot;</p>
<p>The government's 1997 budget, which aims to slash 62.5 trillion lire ($41 billion) off next year's deficit, goes before the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) on Wednesday and must be passed by both houses of parliament before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Prodi is expected to have to use confidence votes to end filibustering and sweep away hundreds of opposition amendments.</p>
<p>Politicians have talked for 15 years about the need to modernise Italy's 1948 constitution and end the long sequence of short-lived governments. But talks on how to go about it have exposed divisions between parties even within the two main blocs.</p>
<p>D'Alema, who has said he would be willing to head the bicameral commission, said both sides had agreed on the need to enact federalist reforms, to reduce the number of seats in parliament and to strengthen the government.</p>
<p>The proposal for a bicameral commission stems from centre-left parties and received strong backing in votes in both the Chamber and the Senate before the summer recess.</p>
<p>The commission cannot begin work until the proposal has been ratified in a second ballot. But D'Alema, the main sponsor of the plan, warned that if parliament did not approve setting up the commission &quot;it will be very hard to find another route&quot;.</p>
<p>Under plans set out earlier this year, the commission would have until June to draft proposals for constitutional reform and parliament would have at least another year to endorse them before they could be implemented.</p>
