<text>
<p>First National Entertainment Corp said Thursday that NASDAQ had delisted its stock from trading through the NASDAQ SmallCap Market, effective July 2.</p>
<p>The company said it would appeal the order and said it believes it will be successful. The appeal process is expected to take about three months, it said.</p>
<p>The company said it will try to establish trading in its common shares through the NASD Bulletin Board.</p>
<p>The company said the NASDAQ listing qualification panel expressed doubts about its ability to remain in compliance with listing criteria. Additionally, the panel noted concern that First National would be perceived in the market as a &quot;public shell&quot; or &quot;blind pool,&quot; First National said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company believes that the NASDAQ Panel was in error in reaching its conclusion on both of these matters and further believes that it will be able to provide substantial input at the appeal,&quot; First National said.</p>
