<headline>SLOVAK C.BANK PROPOSES MAGULA TO GOVERNING BOARD.</headline>

<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said on Tuesday it was proposing former deputy finance minister Jozef Magula as a new governing board member.</p>
<p>The government said earlier it would discuss the appointment of a new board member at its regular Tuesday session but gave no names.</p>
<p>&quot;NBS Governor Vladimir Masar is presenting a proposal to add one new member to the bank board -- Jozef Magula,&quot; bank spokesman Ivan Paska told Reuters.</p>
<p>He added that Masar would propose another board member within 14 days and that soon afterwards the third vacant place on the eight-member board would be filled. He declined to say who the candidates were.</p>
<p>Local bankers have been watching for signs appointment of new board members by the government could reduce the NBS's independence and lead to a loosening of its tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>Leading government officials have repeatedly criticised the NBS's tight policy, which was further strengthened at the end of 1996 after the government approved a fiscal deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP for this year, compared with a 0.4 percent surplus in 1996.</p>
