<p>Consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Tuesday reported higher quarterly profits and cited favourable commodity prices for raw materials and cost cutting.</p>
<p>The company, whose products include Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, said its profits rose to $944 million, or $1.35 a share, on revenues of $9.14 billion in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31. A year earlier it earned $836 million, or $1.18 a share, on revenues of $9.09 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Although improved from last quarter, our priority remains to accelerate sales and unit volume growth,&quot; Chief Executive John Pepper said in a statement.</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble said it expected growth to come through areas such as new product initiatives and added production capacity. The Cincinnati-based company's other products include Ivory soap, Prell shampoo, Noxzema skin cream and Cover Girl cosmetics.</p>
<p>Worldwide unit volume was a record, growing 2 percent from the year-ago quarter, P&amp;G said.</p>
<p>Sales for the quarter grew 1 percent to $9.14 billion, P&amp;G said, adding the difference between sales and unit volume growth was largely due to weaker currencies in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>For the six months, worldwide volume was up 2 percent over the year-ago period while sales were stable, primarily reflecting unfavourable exchange rates.</p>
<p>Cost reduction efforts and lower commodity prices, especially pulp, also helped earnings for the six months, P&amp;G said.</p>
<p>For the six months, earnings rose to $1.92 billion, or $2.74 a share, on revenues of $18.04 billion. A year earlier it earned $1.73 billion, or $2.45 a share, on revenues of $18.12 billion.</p>
<p>P&amp;G stock was up $6.125 to $113.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
