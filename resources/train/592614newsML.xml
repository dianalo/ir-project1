<p>NATO's 16 member states formally approved on Friday a landmark post-Cold War security accord with Russia, negotiated by Secretary General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov earlier this week.</p>
<p>The pact is intended to defuse Russian opposition to NATO's planned expansion into former communist states in Eastern Europe that once formed part of the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>&quot;The North Atlantic Council has given its approval to the Founding Act...between NATO and the the Russian Federation,&quot; an official communique said.</p>
<p>The accord was presented to NATO's ambassadors when Solana returned from Moscow on Wednesday, but national capitals were given 48 hours to object.</p>
<p>The communique confirmed the &quot;Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russia Federation&quot; would be signed in Paris on May 27.</p>
<p>Russia has yet to adopt formally the accord which President Boris Yeltsin described on Thursday as &quot;a really major step aimed at more stability in Europe and the world overall&quot;.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are likely to be invited to join the alliance at a special summit in Madrid on July 8-9, with Slovenia and Romania seen as possibles.</p>
