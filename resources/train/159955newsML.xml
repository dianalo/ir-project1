<p>Ex-president Lech Walesa of Poland brought his anti-communist crusade to Taiwan on Friday, praising its democratic achievements and predicting that communism would perish from the world within five years.</p>
<p>Walesa, on a five-day tour of the island, met Taiwan's democratic pioneer, President Lee Teng-hui, on Friday and said &quot;freedom and democracy ultimately will annihilate communism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a behaviour contrary to the world trend,&quot; Walesa was quoted by Lee's office as saying. &quot;Communism will be replaced completely by freedom and democracy within five years.&quot;</p>
<p>Walesa won the 1993 Nobel peace prize for leading the Polish Solidarity union's peaceful struggle for democracy, which ended with the downfall of Poland's communist government.</p>
<p>Walesa was elected president in 1990 but unseated in 1995 by Aleksander Kwasniewski.</p>
<p>Lee, who in March became the first directly elected president in Chinese history, is widely credited with transforming the island from an authoritarian regime to a democracy that culminated with the March elections.</p>
<p>The elections drew the ire of Taipei's communist rival in China, which has seen Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Beijing launched menacing war games near the island prior to the elections as a warning against any moves away from Taiwan's eventual reunification with the mainland.</p>
<p>In his meeting with Walesa, Lee reiterated the desire of his exiled Republic of China government to reunite with China, but insisted democratic reforms on the mainland must come first.</p>
<p>&quot;Although communist China seeks economic reform and liberalisation, it is still very conservative politically, and would not give freedom and democracy to its people,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>China on Wednesday sentenced democracy advocate Wang Dan to 11 years in prison for plotting to subvert the government, triggering condemnation from many countries.</p>
<p>Walesa urged Lee to &quot;inform world leaders of the struggle of the Republic of China and the hard work it has put in to fight against communism&quot;, Lee's office said.</p>
