<p>The United States is likely to face a critical review of its policy on Iraq from Southeast Asian nations at talks this week on Indonesia's Batam island, diplomats said on Monday.</p>
<p>The meeting on Wednesday between the United States and the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) follows a week after Washington launched missile attacks on Iraqi military targets to punish Baghdad for troop incursions into Kurdish-held regions in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>A U.S. diplomat said the Iraqi conflict would be discussed at the two-day meeting but said he had no details. &quot;All regional and international issues will be discussed, and Iraq will definitely be among them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ASEAN members Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have criticised the U.S. action in Iraq and other diplomats said their concerns would be aired at the meeting.</p>
<p>Also in focus will be Burma, which was granted observer status in ASEAN at a meeting of the group's foreign ministers in July in preparation for full membership.</p>
<p>The United States has expressed concern at Rangoon's human rights record and its suppression of a democracy movement led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>At a meeting of ASEAN and its dialogue partners immediately following the foreign ministers' meeting, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the United States reserved the right of taking forceful action, including economic sanctions, to change Burmese policies.</p>
<p>ASEAN, which also includes Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei, has opposed sanctions against Burma and has said it will keep its links with Rangoon open in an effort to promote &quot;constructive engagement&quot;.</p>
<p>ASEAN, since its inception in 1967, has been loath to criticise domestic policies of any nation in the region in keeping with the group's stand of non-interference in internal issues.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the positions of ASEAN and the United States on Burma remained apart and added that the Batam meeting would discuss the situation in detail.</p>
<p>ASEAN Secretary-General Ajit Singh said the meeting would also focus on economic links, trade, the environment and ASEAN's plans to reduce tariffs in the region.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation to the meeting will include a high-powered business team that will hold a parallel meeting with regional business leaders, he said.</p>
<p>ASEAN has held regular talks with the United States, one of its 18 dialogue partners, for 13 years.</p>
<p>The Batam meeting replaces a meeting scheduled for January on the island of Bali, which was postponed after blizzards in the United States prevented the delegation from arriving on time.</p>
