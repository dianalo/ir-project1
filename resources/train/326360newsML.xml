<headline>INSTANT VIEW - UK December retail sales data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following is a selection of economists' reactions to data showing UK December retail sales fell 0.8 percent m /m and up 2.9 pct y/y. The consensus forecast was for a 0.1 percent rise m/m and a 3.5 pct rise y/y.</p>
<p>STEPHEN HANNAH, IBJ INTERNATIONAL</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously considerably weaker than expected. Looking at the underlying picture, up 0.9% on the quarter, 3.6% year on year -- we had been hoping for around a four percent figure, so there is some evidence of a weakening of the trend.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;I would caution that this December figure can often be distorted by minor variations in seasonal patterns. Obviously this does provide the Chancellor with a further excuse for not raising interest rates at this stage.&quot;  </p>
<p>JEREMY HAWKINS, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;Much weaker than even the British Retail Consortium and CBI surveys intimated. Indeed the 0.8 pct fall in the headline index would have been larger still but for a bounce in spending on food. Non-food sales were off a chunky 1.7 percent. Probably of most interest is the clothing and footwear sector, which saw a remarkable 4.6 percent slump. This is significant since the previous two months saw sizeable price hikes and were a major factor for doubting the the Chancellor's 2.5 percent RPIX target.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;These data suggest that the consumer is still not prepared to accept significant price increases. This argues against any marked deterioration in the inflation outlook even if, as seems likely, the December slide in sales proves just a temporary phenomenon. Looking ahead, there is good reason for supposing that consumer deman will pick up again.&quot;  </p>
<p>JOHN SHEPPERD, YAMAICHI</p>
<p>&quot;Surprising. Notwithstanding the evidence from the CBI and the BRC, sitll weaker than one might have thought...One suspects the market's confidence that rates are going up before the election must increasingly be called into question. A lot still hangs on the Q4 GDP numbers. The quarter-on-quarter rise in retail sales was 0.9%, so the trend is still reasonably firm. But if the Chancellor is looking for excuses not to put rates up before the election, then the recent accumulation of data has gone very much his way and this is another strong piece of ammunition for him in arguing against a rate rise.&quot;  </p>
<p>MARIAN BELL, ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND</p>
<p>&quot;We had expected the official series to show soft December UK retail sales, but the 0.8 pct m/m fall, taking y/y growth down to 2.9 pct, was substantially weaker than either our or the market forecast -- strongly gilt and short sterling positive, sterling negative. However, Q4 spending was still up 3.6 percent y/y and we look for a strong January y/y rebound, reflecting seasonal adjustment problems and base effects.&quot;</p>
