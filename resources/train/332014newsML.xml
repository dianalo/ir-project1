<title>BELGIUM: Collins wants strong EU food safety policy.</title>
<headline>Collins wants strong EU food safety policy.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-01-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The head of the European Parliament's environment committee said on Thursday that the European Union needed a strong food safety policy soon, to tackle crises like mad cow disease.</p>
<p>The BSE scare had revealed the need completely to separate responsibility for food safety and farm production, both in the European Commission and at national government level, British Socialist Ken Collins told Reuters.</p>
<p>Collins, who was re-elected last week to head the environment and public health committee for a further two and a half years, said food hygiene policy would be one of his main priorities for 1997.</p>
<p>The committee would also be fighting to secure more EU money for public health protection, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Community could do a lot in public health. We have a huge population we could use as an epidemiological laboratory for cancer and cardio-vascular propblems,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>Work will also continue on a series of environmental files, including water policy, the review of the EU's fifth multi- annual environment programme, and a new set of standards on motor fuel quality and car emissions (the Auto-Oil programme).</p>
<p>Collins said he hoped parliament could give the Auto-Oil programme a first reading in April.</p>
<p>Efforts to get the member states to respect their commitments to combat CO2 emissions and climate change would continue to figure on the committee's agenda, he predicted.</p>
<p>&quot;There are going to be repeated attempts to unblock (this) dossier. We have to do something,&quot; Collins said.</p>
<p>But he was pessimistic about the chances of getting EU governments to agree to a CO2/energy tax as a means of reducing CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Another bone of contention is the Commission's attempts to lift a ban on imports of fur from animals caught in cruel leghold traps.</p>
<p>The move is fiercely opposed by MEPs and EU environment ministers, who want a total ban by March 31.</p>
<p>Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan has said the ban, covering furs from North America and Russia, should be lifted because the U.S. said it breached free trade rules and would be challenged through the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>A WTO challenge could be a problem, Collins admitted, but this did not excuse the Commission in general from disregarding the wishes of the Council and the parliament, or Brittan in particular for not defending EU interests more forcefully.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee's view is that Leon Brittan has got perilously close to being the WTO's representative in Europe, not Europe's representative at the WTO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The committee plans to demand an explanation from the Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;If the parliament says something should be done and the Council says something should be done...then I don't think it's for unelected commissioners to act in a different way,&quot; Collins said.</p>
<p>Leghold traps are used in the U.S., Canada and Russia to capture animals such as beaver, mink, sable and fox.</p>
<p>Their critics say they frequently break animals' legs, and that many animals stay in the traps for days, bleeding or starving to death.</p>
