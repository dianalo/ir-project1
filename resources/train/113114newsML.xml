<p>China will bar foreign companies from holding controlling stakes in priority areas of the chemical industry, the Business Weekly said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Large scale enterprises in these areas, which include soda ash and &quot;sensitive materials&quot;, would be discouraged from transferring equity, the newspaper quoted Chemical Industry Minister Gu Xiulian as saying.</p>
<p>There was no indication of when the move might go into effect.</p>
<p>The policy &quot;does not mean we are totally opposed to stock control by foreign businesses,&quot; Gu said, adding that many ventures controlled by foreigners in the industry were well run.</p>
<p>Gu had previously told reporters that China was planning to review its policies towards joint ventures in the chemical industry.</p>
<p>She had suggested that areas where new technology was vital would remain open to foreign control but other less crucial areas might be closed to more than 50 percent foreign ownership.</p>
<p>China is particularly encouraging direct foreign investment in fertilisers, ethylene, synthetic materials as well as fine chemical products  -- either as wholly-owned or jointly-owned operations, she said.  </p>
<p>China has not said that it would block minority stakes in joint ventures in the industry.</p>
<p>Gu was also quoted by the newspaper as saying that joint ventures needed greater ability to conduct research and carry out technical upgradings.</p>
<p>&quot;The relationship between self-development, self-research and reliance on foreign firms to develop products should be properly dealt with,&quot; she said without giving further details.</p>
<p>She also criticised the &quot;Westernisation&quot; of well known domestic products, saying that China needed an integration of well-known foreign brands and domestic products.</p>
