<p>Iraq abruptly dropped its threat to shoot at Western planes patrolling its airspace on Friday, hours after U.S. Stealth bombers arrived in Kuwait as part of a major U.S. military buildup in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The United States reacted cautiously to the Iraqi decision and pressed ahead with its build-up of forces in the Gulf and a drive to garner international support for its stance.</p>
<p>President Bill clinton decided to send his Defence Secretary William Perry to the Middle East to consult with U.S. allies on the Iraq situation, Defence officials said.</p>
<p>The officials declined to give details on when and where Perry was going but did not deny earlier reports he would leave shortly on a visit to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Turkey.</p>
<p>The Iraqi News Agency reported that President Saddam Hussein's ruling Revolutionary Command Council &quot;has decided today to suspend our military reaction (until further notice)...as of 2400 local time (2000 GMT)&quot;.</p>
<p>The Iraqi agency quoted a Council spokesman saying Baghdad still considered the no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq, patrolled by Western aircraft, to be illegitimate.</p>
<p>A senior Kuwaiti official dismissed the decision, saying Saddam must recognise the Western zones from which Iraqi flights are banned, including an expanded one in the south up to the outskirts of Baghdad.</p>
<p>World oil prices had risen sharply amid expectations of an imminent U.S. attack against Iraqi targets, but the rally came to an abrupt halt after Baghdad appeared to step back from a confrontation with Washington.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters it would be &quot;encouraging&quot; if the Iraq declaration was followed by action, but added: &quot;However, we will continue to move forces into the region as necessary to protect our interests.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States, which had dispatched a second aircraft carrier as well as Stealth aircraft and B-52 long-range bombers to confront Iraq, said immediately it would be &quot;looking at actions, not statements&quot;.</p>
<p>After Clinton's national security advisers met at the White House to map out the next moves in the showdown with Iraq, administration officials spoke of a bid for broad-based international support for military moves.</p>
<p>With the exception of the British, most allies have been tepid at best in their support for the two cruise missile attacks Clinton ordered last week in retaliation for military action by Baghdad against Kurds in the north.</p>
<p>With further military strikes being considered virtually inevitable around Washington, White House officials said Clinton would not be rushed and was taking time to build support among reluctant allies and the American public.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants to build a consensus. It's important,&quot; one official said in noting that the president was willing to defer an immediate strike briefly in order to strengthen its diplomatic and political underpinnings, especially this close to the November 5 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Iraq, which a week ago said it no longer recognised the five-year-old no-fly zones, had earlier vowed no &quot;surrender&quot; and accused Clinton of arrogance.</p>
<p>&quot;We are much smaller than America, which has a great power,&quot; Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said in an interview with Russian television. &quot;But what shall we do? &quot;Shall we surrender? Definitely not, because American greed knows no limit.&quot;</p>
<p>Preparations for an attack on Iraq have drawn criticism of Clinton from both directions -- with critics at home saying he has shown weakness and those abroad urging restraint.</p>
<p>Eight F-117A Stealth fighters landed in Kuwait at dusk on Friday but the aircraft carrier Enterprise, carrying another 75 warplanes, was unlikely to be in the Gulf until Sunday.</p>
<p>The Stealth planes, which can evade radar, used laser-guided 2,000 pound bombs to hit key targets in Baghdad during the 1991 Gulf War when a U.S.-led coalition drove Saddam's occupation forces from Kuwait.</p>
<p>The aircraft carrier Enterprise, with 75 warplanes, was steaming from the Adriatic Sea to the Gulf via the Suez Canal to join the carrier Carl Vinson. The two ships have F-14 fighters adapted to carry accurate laser-guided bombs.</p>
<p>The United States had already moved long-range B-52 bombers to a British base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, within striking distance of Iraq.</p>
<p>The bombers were used to launch cruise missile strikes against Iraq last week in reprisal for moving troops into the Kurdish north of Iraq, a region closed to Iraqi forces and under Western protection for the past five years.</p>
<p>In another echo of the Gulf War, the U.S. Army said it was activating two Patriot anti-missile batteries, used to defend Saudi Arabia and Israel against Iraqi Scud missiles in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (Saddam's government) really only understand disproportionate force,&quot; said former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, who helped build the coalition for the Gulf War.</p>
<p>But divisions in the coalition that fought Iraq five years ago, already apparent after the U.S. missile strikes last week, continued to grow.</p>
<p>Turkey, which provides a base for western aircraft to protect Kurds in northern Iraq against Saddam, warned against further U.S. strikes and called for a diplomatic strategy.</p>
<p>China said on Friday it strongly opposed a U.S. attack on Iraq, saying such problems should be resolved under United Nations resolutions.</p>
<p>Russia, another of the five permanent members of the Security Council that had approved the Gulf War, sounded a similar warning on Thursday. France also expressed concern.</p>
<p>The crisis began with Saddam's military backing for a Kurdish faction that secured control of northern Iraq this week.</p>
<p>Fear of Saddam's return to the north prompted Kurds opposed to the Baghdad government or with links to the West -- military and aid organisations -- to flee.</p>
<p>Turkey's ambassador to Washington, Nuzhet Kandemir, said Ankara was providing aircraft to help the United States fly 2,500 Americans, Kurds and Iraqi dissidents from northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said in Geneva it had confirmed that 30,000 other Iraqi Kurds were now in Iran.</p>
