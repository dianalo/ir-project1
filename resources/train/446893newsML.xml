<title>JAMAICA: Bank of Nova Scotia to manage Jamaica's Eagle.</title>
<headline>Bank of Nova Scotia to manage Jamaica's Eagle.</headline>
<dateline>KINGSTON, Jamaica 1997-03-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bank of Nova Scotia on Monday took management control of Jamaica's troubled Eagle Group, following the signing of a restructuring deal with the government announced over the weekend.</p>
<p>Eagle chairman Paul Chen-Young sold 80-90 percent of the group to the government for J$1 and formally handed in his resignation.</p>
<p>The group includes a commercial and a merchant bank, a life insurance company, First Equity, a Miami investment bank and two local hotels managed by Holiday Inn.  Total group assets stand at US$300 million.  </p>
<p>Finance minister Omar Davies has promised that &quot;all savers, depositors and policyholders will be 100 percent protected&quot; and all the groups entities will remain open for business.</p>
<p>Officials say the government's strategy is to return the group to its financial services base and sell off the real estate and hotel ownership.</p>
<p>Eagle ran into trouble when its life company, Crown Eagle, made several bad real estate investments coupled with a massive withdrawal on its equities-linked life polices several years ago.  </p>
<p>Crown Eagle turned to the commercial bank for loans, and the overdraft eventually with Jamaica's central bank eventually went to J$6 billion (US$171.4 million).</p>
<p>An estimated J$3 billion (US$85.7 million) will now be provided by government to Eagle to help wipe out the Bank of Jamaica overdraft and provide liquidity support.</p>
<p>Late last month, the government took board control of another life company, Mutual Life, with assets of US$1.6 billion, in return for J$1.5 billion (US$42.8 million) in similar liquidity support.  </p>
<p>Officials said over the weekend another three life companies -- Island Life, Dyoll Life and Life of Jamaica -- will split another J$1.7 billion (US$48.5 million) in government support.</p>
<p>All the companies involved have been affected by cash flow problems resulting from a combination of government's tighter monetary policies and the recent slump in the commercial real estate market, in which they had invested heavily.</p>
<p>The authorities have allocated J$6.3 billion (US$180 million) in this first tranche under the restructuring exercise, although more could be made available, according to Davies.  The funding will come from a series of short and long-term government bonds to be issued either locally or overseas, he added.</p>
