<p>Estonia's nominated prime minister Mart Siimann was given the authority on Wednesday to form a new government which he assured the country would not change the path of Estonian reform.</p>
<p>In a parliamentary vote, 72 members of the Baltic country's 101 seat house gave Siimann the authority to form a government. Thirteen voted against him, three did not vote, two abstained, and 11 members were absent.</p>
<p>&quot;The new government sees its mission to continue the reforms,&quot; Siimann said in a speech to parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not planning large changes in economic policy and at the same time, we are proceeding with the understanding that Estonian society is reaching a new level of development.&quot;</p>
<p>Siimann, 50, heads the parliamentary faction of the Coalition Party, the biggest group in parliament.</p>
<p>Estonia is currently ruled by a minority administration of the Coalition Party and a block of rural parties which commands the support of 41 seats in the house.</p>
<p>Siimann now has seven days to form a government of 15 ministers to present to the president. The president then has three days to appoint Siimann as prime minister.</p>
<p>Siimann is replacing veteran politician Tiit Vaehi who stepped down last month after 22 months in office after narrowly winning a parliament no-confidence vote amid allegations he took part in shady privatisation deals.</p>
<p>Siimann said the economy would be a major priority for his government.</p>
<p>Estonia's economic reform has been hailed as the success story of the former Soviet republics since regaining independence in 1991.</p>
<p>The government has a balanced budget and the central bank has forecast inflation falling to between 10-14 percent this year and Gross Domestic Product rising four-five percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have reached the period when the decisions of the upcoming government will be aimed at strengthening macroeconomic stability and economic growth,&quot; said Siimann, who was previously a television and radio manager.</p>
<p>He said the slow pace of land reform was now the key question for economic development and the main source of dissatisfaction for the public.</p>
<p>&quot;This problem must be addressed by strengthening the leadership of carrying out land reform and giving more concrete assignments and deadlines,&quot; Siimann said.</p>
<p>&quot;The second priority beside land reform is reform in the pension system which will lead to the creation of individual pension plans and possibly an additional voluntary pension system in the private sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Siimann said his government would continue the drive for European Union and NATO membership.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that Estonia has both a responsibility to and need to carry a common responsibility for the future of Europe,&quot; Siimann said.</p>
