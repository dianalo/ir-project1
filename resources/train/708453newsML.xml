<title>JAPAN: JGBs end higher, imminent rate rise seen unlikely.</title>
<headline>JGBs end higher, imminent rate rise seen unlikely.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Key September 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures rose to close at two-month highs on Friday as dealers started to believe it unlikely that Japan would raise interest rates in the near future.</p>
<p>Such views spread especially after U.S. Treasuries rose overnight and prompted two major domestic banks to buy fixed interest rates in the Interest Rate Swap (IRS) market this morning, traders said.</p>
<p>News in the afternoon that construction firm Tokai Kogyo Co Ltd had decided to apply for court protection also fuelled such sentiment, but only briefly.  </p>
<p>September ended up 0.28 at 125.01 in turnover of 58,615 contracts. The key contract ended above 125.00 for the first time since May 2. Traders said the recovery indicated an end to the recent fall caused by firmness in Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>A dealer at a long-term credit bank's securities unit said the market overreacted when the contract hit a session high of 125.24 after the news about Tokai Kogyo.</p>
<p>&quot;The news just reconfirmed what the market had believed, that there would be no imminent rate rise. The market soon ran out of steam as the news failed to trigger buying from investors,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Buying emerged immediately after the domestic media reported that Tokai Kogyo was preparing to apply for court protection, traders said.</p>
<p>The company later told Reuters that its board members have decided that the construction firm will apply for court protection under Japanese bankruptcy laws.</p>
<p>When a company applies for court protection from creditors under Japanese law, the move is widely regarded as a sign that the company is on the verge of failing.</p>
<p>Private credit research firm Teikoku Databank Ltd said Tokai's debts totalled 510 billion yen.  </p>
<p>The news backed up the widespread perception that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will not raise interest rates in the near future as bad loan problems among general construction and real estate companies are still hampering a recovery in the economy.</p>
<p>But traders said impact was limited because Tokai Kogyo was among those which were said to be suffering from bad loans.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the news, investors were not in a hurry to buy in the rally. Instead, they were selling to take profits at the long-end of the JGB yield curve,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Hedge funds were also said to have sold JGB futures this afternoon when prices were at high levels.  </p>
<p>The yield of key 182nd 10-year JGB stood down 0.035 at 2.260 percent at 0736 GMT after falling as low as 2.250.</p>
<p>A senior official at a major life insurer said that the current level was not attractive enough for the company to boost its JGB holdings. &quot;If the key 10-year JGB yield rises to 2.5 percent or so, we'd like to increase our JGB holdings. But otherwise, we may buy more foreign bonds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, banks which had paid fixed interest rates before the release of key economic data in mid-June were reversing their positions in the IRS market, causing a change in sentiment in JGBs, traders said.- Risa Maeda +81-33432-8570</p>
