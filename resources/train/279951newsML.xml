<headline>Fed seen adding temporary reserves, funds tight.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>A firm Federal funds rate, reflecting year- and period-end pressures on reserves, means the Federal Reserve will add temporary reserves to the banking system on Monday, analysts said.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the precise operation the Fed's open market desk would undertake included overnight system repurchase agreements or term system repurchases.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect term system repo's, but there's a risk of overnight repo's,&quot; said Kim Rupert, senior economist at MMS International.  </p>
<p>James Blumenthal, economist at MCM MoneyWatch, said he expects the Fed to add temporary reserves via overnight system repurchase agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;You have a fairly large add need, but you do have some system RPs outstanding,&quot; he said, referring to 13- and 14-day system repurchase agreements the Fed has recently conducted.</p>
<p>But Blumenthal noted that the four-day system that the Fed did on Thursday &quot;runs off today so that definitely needs to be replaced.&quot;  </p>
<p>Federal funds traded at 5-1/2 percent in early activity, above the Fed's 5-1/4 percent target for the rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Funds are very tight due to year-end pressures,&quot; said Rupert. &quot;Banks need funds to close up their books.</p>
<p>&quot;Also, period-end pressures are creeping in,&quot; she said, referring to the end of the two-week bank reserve maintenance period on Wednesday.</p>
