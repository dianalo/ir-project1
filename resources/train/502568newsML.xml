<p>Taiwan said on Friday it would allow four shipping firms from arch-rival China to sail directly across the Taiwan Strait to the island, cautiously easing a ban dating back to the civil war that split them in 1949.</p>
<p>&quot;They can start whenever they are ready,&quot; Teng You-yi, a senior official at Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung port, told Reuters by telephone after signing the approvals.</p>
<p>The move eliminates the final hurdle to the first direct sailings of the Taiwan Strait in 48 years, although Nationalist Taiwan -- deeply wary of communist China -- has put restrictions in place forbidding direct cargo exchanges.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not fall into communist China's trap and believe that this is direct links,&quot; said Kao Koong-lien, vice chairman of the cabinet's policy-making Mainland Affairs Council.</p>
<p>&quot;What we will conduct is offshore transshipments,&quot; Kao said. &quot;It's clearly not direct links because (mainland) cargoes will not be able to enter our customs and will not enter Taiwan.&quot;</p>
<p>Taipei has banned direct contacts with the mainland since the Nationalist Republic of China, defeated by the communists in 1949, fled into exile on Taiwan. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel-held province that must be brought under its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Taiwan will allow approved vessels to sail directly into Kaohsiung from China's ports at Xiamen or Fuzhou, but insists their cargoes be shipped onward to third countries -- refusing entry to Taiwan customs to uphold the ban on direct contacts.</p>
<p>Likewise, Taiwan cargoes at Kaohsiung cannot be put directly aboard vessels that will cross to Xiamen or Fuzhou.</p>
<p>There was no word from Beijing about applications submitted by a dozen Taiwan shipping firms eager to ply the long-forbidden routes. China has said it was reviewing the requests and would act on them promptly.</p>
<p>Kao urged Beijing to issue approvals swiftly, saying Taipei had acted in good faith and hoped for further developments.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows our government's good will and sincerity, but it takes effort by both sides,&quot; Kao said. &quot;By doing offshore transshipments we hope both sides can find common interest and cultivate mutual trust. Then we can prepare for direct links.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 30,000 Taiwan firms cultivating US$30 billion in &quot;indirect&quot; mainland investments have pressed Taipei to ease its ban, saying direct sea, air and other links would pare away the extra costs of routing business through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spokesman M.S. Tsay of container giant Yangming Marine Transport Co, one of Taiwan's direct-links hopefuls, hailed the breakthrough and urged Beijing to reciprocate.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting for movement by the mainland,&quot; Tsay said.</p>
<p>Yangming and other Taiwan shippers say they expect to profit from the new routes despite the cargo restrictions.</p>
<p>Taiwan approved weekly or twice-weekly routes by one ship each from state-owned mainland firms Fujian Foreign Trade Centre Shipping Co, Fujian Provincial Shipping Co, Fujian Xiamen Shipping Co and Shamen Ocean Shipping Co, officials said.</p>
<p>Two of the mainland ships fly Panamanian flags, while two are registered in Saint Vincent. Taiwan bars vessels flying communist China's red five-starred flag, while those flying Taiwan's Republic of China flag are unwelcome in mainland ports.</p>
<p>Both sides have said they would allow Hong Kong-flagged ships to make the crossings.</p>
