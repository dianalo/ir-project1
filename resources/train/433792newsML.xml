<headline>Madrid stocks end lower after sharp initial gains.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Madrid stocks ended lower on Tuesday, overturning initial sharp gains on technical factors, dealers said.</p>
<p>Stocks are seen consolidating, and then moving higher again.</p>
<p>The general index fell 1.55 points, 0.32 percent, to 488.05 and the Ibex shed 17.64 points, 0.31 percent, to 5,603.10.</p>
<p>The market's focus should now shift to Thursday's release of February CPI data, with a possible key rate cut seen on Friday. But volatility ahead of those figures may keep investors wary, dealers said.</p>
<p>Trade today was characterised by heavy volume, backed by domestic funds, and concentrated in Telefonica, Santander and Endesa. But most were optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The market got weaker during the afternoon, but it's got a very firm base which may allow for new gains short term, and clearly in the medium term&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>February inflation, is seen on average at 2.9 percent year-on-year, in which case some see room for a fresh Bank of Spain rate cut on Friday.</p>
<p>However others argue that the peseta's current performance will hold the central bank off.</p>
