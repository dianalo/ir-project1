<p>Austrian shares followed international mood swings on Monday, ending 0.44 percent down after shedding early modest gains.</p>
<p>The blue-chip ATX index closed 5.74 points lower at 1,298.0, with 13 losers outnumbering seven gainers. One issue was unchanged. Earlier the ATX had touched an intra-day high of 1,310.45 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Early on we followed the international lead higher. Then sentiment changed and we headed back down again,&quot; a trader said, adding that Vienna would probably continue its downward path on Tuesday if the dollar remained weak.</p>
<p>Market participants were divided on the technical outlook. Some painted a bearish picture after support at 1,305 points failed to hold. Others cherished the hope of a rally back above the key 1,300 level.</p>
<p>ATX heavyweight OMV was the day's biggest decliner. The oil and gas group group slid 2.15 pct to 1,534 schillings.</p>
<p>Brick maker Wienerberger finished 16 schillings higher at 2,537 after the company announced it was selling its Treibacher Schleifmittel abrasive materials unit to a German industrialist group for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Analysts welcomed the sale as a canny move.</p>
<p>Preferred shares in Bank Austria were the top gainer, rebounding 1.68 percent to 400.10 schillings after last week's sharp falls.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, water purification company BWT shot to an all-time high of 1,900 schillings before easing back to 1,850, 21 schillings up on the day. Traders noted the share succeeded in breaking through heavy resistance last week.</p>
<p>June ATX futures stood 10.5 points down at 1,296.5. The broad-based Vienna bourse index ended 1.74 points down at 476.88. -- Vienna newsroom, +43-1 531 12 254</p>
