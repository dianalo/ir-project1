<title>USA: CME cattle futures end down on slumping beef price.</title>
<headline>CME cattle futures end down on slumping beef price.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME live and feeder cattle futures closed lower on falling beef prices and higher grain futures, which particularly weighed on feeder cattle values, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.625 to 0.150 cent per lb lower with April off most at 67.700 cents. Feeder cattle ended 0.250 to 0.900 cent lower with May off 0.850 at 67.550 cents.</p>
<p>Concern that beef clearance was not as good as expected over the weekend at supermarket meat counters and further dips in beef values at noon, down $0.04 to $0.21 per cwt for choice beef, weighed on live cattle futures. Fund rolling added to nearby weakness, traders said.</p>
<p>Slow cash trade also kept buyers out of the market. Live trade is expected to be thin until later in the week, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders were nervous with lower (cash) bids and a little bit of a carryover showlist,&quot; said Dale Benson, vice president and senior livestock analyst for Dean Witter.</p>
<p>Benson and other traders also cited fund rolling which touched off sell stops on the break, basis April. Higher corn futures also weighed on prices, especially feeder cattle.  </p>
<p>Declines were clipped somewhat in nearby contracts of feeder cattle, based their discount to recent cash cattle prices, but futures fell to new day's lows late when CBOT corn futures ran up to 5-1/2 month highs. Losses in deferred live cattle added to pressure, part of which was linked to early estimates on Friday's monthly USDA Cattle-on-Feed report indicating larger-than-year-ago on-feed numbers, they said.</p>
<p>Early analyst expectations on USDA's cattle report ranged from 106 to 107.2 percent of a year ago for on-feed supplies in the seven key states as of March 1. Early February placement estimates ranged from 102.4 to 109.5 percent and marketings from 97 to 99.5 percent of last year.</p>
<p>Fund rolling, buying of August and October and selling of nearbys as well as the &quot;Goldman roll&quot;, which was selling in April and buying in June, also pressured nearby live cattle.</p>
<p>Refco bought June and sold April live cattle, traders said. Cargill Investor Services and R.J. O'Brien were net sellers of April late, sources said. In live cattle options, commission houses sold April 67 and 70 puts early. There was selling of the April 68 straddle late which made for steady to weak volatility. June volatility was also steady to weak. RBH sold October 64 puts, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Cargill, LIT division of First Options and E.D.&amp;F. Man notably sold most feeder contracts, traders said. Cargill also spread long May feeders/short October live cattle early. Refco notably sold August and LFG sold the May 68 puts in options, pit sources added.</p>
