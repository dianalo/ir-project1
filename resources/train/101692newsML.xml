<headline>CSCE coffee ends weaker, nearby switch widens.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee prices settled slightly lower on Tuesday in a mild technical correction following five consecutive sessions of gains, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has built a constructive technical pattern, but today was a correction,&quot; said Refco Inc analyst Ann Prendergast.</p>
<p>Dealers said light origin selling and speculative profit taking accounted for most of the day's losses. But they noted steady trade buying limited losses and kept active December above nearby chart support at 111.00 cents a lb.</p>
<p>December futures eased 0.20 cent per lb on the day, to 112.50 cents, after ranging between 113.20 and 111.20. Second-month March finished down 0.60, to 105.65, while the rest softened 0.25 to 0.50.</p>
<p>Despite today's losses, traders said the market continued to look bullish. They noted the strong performance by the closely watched December/March switch, which expanded by more than a penny during the session, before settling at 6.85 cents, up from 6.50 cents at the close Monday.  </p>
<p>Although traders showed little reaction to the latest drop in certified coffee stocks, they said concerns about low near-term supplies continued to buoy the nearby switch and provide underlying support to the market.</p>
<p>U.S. certified coffee stocks fell by 945 60-kg bags in the week ended October 4, to set a new 12-year low of 30,724 bags, the CSCE reported after the close of business Monday.</p>
<p>With harvests in many Central American countries getting off to a slow start, traders said stock levels were likely to remain low for at least another four to six weeks.</p>
<p>On the charts, traders pegged December's next level of resistance at 115 cents, followed by 118. Support was noted at 108.</p>
<p>Volume was moderate at an estimated 7,410 lots, little changed from Monday's official tally of 7,811 lots.</p>
