<p>Random Lengths Gross List Cash Lumber Prices Quotes:</p>
<p>   (2x4 Std&amp;Btr)	   MIDWEEK   FRIDAY   WEEK AGO</p>
<p> Inland Hem-Fir		447	447	442</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Comment - Cash lumber prices were flat to up with modest carryover from last week, said Random Lengths in its midweek report. Pending scheduled curtailments took selling pressure off many producers and most mills found that they could move prmpt loadings at or close to asking levels.  </p>
<p>Wholesalers sold back to back or from modest inventories, while distributors bought items easiest to move. On the labor front in British Columbia pulp and paper talks broke down, while negotiations continued on the solid wood side.</p>
<p>Annual Canadian export quota used as of about June 17 was 23.8 percent.</p>
<p>Western spruce-pine-fir prices climbed on momentum from last week's activity, but the sales pace eased. Most producers priced standard and better 2x4s in the $372-$380 range, although some struggled to sell at $380. Most active and tight No. 2 and better 2x10s, which gained $11.  </p>
<p>Secondaries often trailed mill prices by $5 to $10, as they lightened inventories prior to the holiday week.</p>
<p>Eastern spruce-pine-fir opened the week with higher prices on the narrows of No. 1 and No. 2 and studs. Trading tapered slightly with Tuesday's holiday in Quebec. Most mills operated with extended order files, limited offerings and vacation curtailments in the offing. Secondaries reported steady sales to dealers and more difficulty booking replacements.</p>
<p>Southern pine producers were able to maintain or even build on order files. Few end-of-the-month buildups were reported. Prices of No. 2 dimension held or crept higher.</p>
<p>Inland dimension and stud sales were tentative but many prices rose on the strength of last week's finish. No. 2 and better 2x6s were active in both hem-fir and fir and larch while interest in the wides was fair.</p>
<p>Slower sales overall combined with some month-end discounting softened prices of ponderosa pine No. 2 and better 1x12s. No. 3 1x12s also weakened.</p>
<p>Coast hem-fir and dry Douglas fir trading picked up Tuesday. Although producers sold more volume to eastern rail markets, overall demand was modest. Lower-priced stock was cleaned up and prices held or gained $5-$10 in hem-fir and $1-$8 in fir.</p>
<p>OSB prices gave ground in the face of spotty mill sales and shrinking order files. With prompt shipments readily available, dealers stuck to just-in-time purchasing. Secondaries struggled to sell what they owned.</p>
