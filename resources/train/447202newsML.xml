<p>CBOT soy product futures ended sharply lower as funds sold at least 3,000 lots of soyoil and 2,000 lots of soymeal, traders said.</p>
<p>The technical fund selling combined with a bleak demand outlook knocked soyoil down nearly the 1.00 cent per lb limit. Traders noted Brazilian soybeans were of better quality and cheaper than U.S. supplies and world buyers were beginning to turn their attention south.</p>
<p>Brazil's soybean crop was 21 percent harvested as of Mardh 13, well ahead of the five-year average of 11 percent, according to Safras e Mercado.</p>
<p>Confirmation Brazil would not impose an export tax on soy products also pressured the market. Brazilian crushers and the Brazilian Agricultural Ministry on Friday denied reports of a three percent export tax on soy products, saying it was unlikely and would be rejected by the ministry if proposed.</p>
<p>News Friday that three Cargill Inc processors will temporarily shut down this summer supported belief that demand was slipping. Crushers cited poor margins due to rising soybean prices.</p>
<p>Soymeal ended $7.10 to $3.40 per ton lower with May off $6.80 at $267.90 while soyoil closed 0.96 to 0.79 cent per lb lower with May down 0.91 at 24.47.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today the trade gained a little bit of confidence that we've reached levels where demand is going to slow down with competition from South America,&quot; said Don Roose of U.S. Commodities. &quot;We'll find out on Thursday on our export sales and crush reports.&quot;</p>
<p>Funds were aggressive sellers on the day, erasing gains posted on Friday. On the day, Rosenthal Collins and Griffin Trading each sold at least 700 lots May soyoil. Cargill Inc sold 600 May and R.J. O'Brien sold 500 May.</p>
<p>In soymeal, Griffin Trading sold 500 lots July, 400 August and 300 December and R.J. O'Brien sold 300 May, traders said.</p>
<p>Soymeal volume was estimated by CBOT at 35,000 lots, compared with Friday's actual volume of 28,974 lots. Soyoil volume was pegged at 23,000 lots, against Friday's actual of 18,653 lots.</p>
