<p>Italy's economy in 1997 will grow at a slower pace than expected with no signs of an upturn until the second half of the year, economists said.</p>
<p>A Reuter quarterly poll of 18 analysts showed average forecasts for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.2 percent against an estimate three months ago of 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>The government's official GDP growth target for 1997 is 2.0 percent following an expected 0.8 percent rise in 1996.</p>
<p>But on January 15 Labour Minister Tiziano Treu said GDP this year was seen growing between 1.2 and 1.5 percent. &quot;I expect this year to be a year of recovery even if it won't be sparkling,&quot; he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio has been even more pessimistic, saying: &quot;Economic growth in 1997 will not be far from the unsatisfactory figure seen in 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>Latest official figures put third quarter 1996 annual growth at 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts polled said still depressed levels of private and public consumer demand would brake economic growth, while investment was seen increasing, although only modestly.</p>
<p>Italy's foreign trade balance was seen making a positive contribution with exports continuing to increase more than imports rise, while stocks after a strong drawdown last year would be built up again gradually.</p>
<p>&quot;The cycle will be influenced by the European economic trend and in particular by the speed of the German locomotive,&quot; said Alfredo Granata, analyst at Banca di Roma.</p>
<p>All the economists surveyed said a boost to the economy from domestic demand would remain limited, leading to less growth in Italy's GDP than the European average.</p>
<p>&quot;The one-off Eurotax this year will eat into disposable income and this will result in even less consumer demand,&quot; said Paolo Casadio, analyst at Credito Italiano. The Milan bank saw private consumer demand growing only 0.8 percent this year with public sector demand falling 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>Bank of America and DRI forecast private consumer demand growing 0.7 percent while Banca di Roma saw a 0.9 percent rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumer confidence should improve, partly because taxpayers have had several months now to get grumbles over the Eurotax off their chests,&quot; said Banca di Roma's Granata.</p>
<p>The unpopular 12.5 trillion lire Eurotax, including a one-off 5.5 trillion levy on incomes, is one of the main planks of the 1997 budget aimed at keeping alive hopes of early membership of the single European currency.</p>
<p>Analysts' forecasts of investment levels varied. &quot;In 1997 company profits will be in line with 1996. The brake on investment growth will come from high real interest rates,&quot; said Ottavio Ricchi of DRI who saw investments growing 3.1 percent against 1.6 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Bank of America economist Bruno Rovelli said investments would be limited by &quot;a continuing stagnating economy but also by bank rates which are not yet in line with market rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Casadio underlined the financing difficulties faced by small-to-medium-sized companies and noted 1996 profits were less than in past years. Credito Italiano did not expect investment growth to exceed 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>Forecasts were generally for healthy export growth. &quot;Italian firms are very competitive,&quot; said Rovelli who saw 1997 exports growing 6.5 percent. Credito Italiano forecast 4.0 percent but DRI saw only 1.6 percent growth.</p>
