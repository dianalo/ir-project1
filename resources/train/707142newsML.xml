<p>The Tanzanian shilling ended the week unchanged against the dollar but weaker against the pound, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The shilling was traded at a commercial mean rate of 624.6900 to the dollar, unchanged from Thursday. Last Friday it stood at 624.2445.</p>
<p>Against the pound the shilling stood at a mean rate of 1054.0098 from 1045.1095 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the shilling remained stable for most of the week, defying expectations of a slight appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;The shilling has been generally flat for most of the week. We were expecting it to appreciate but it seems that is not likely to happen,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Less intervention by the central bank, which had confined its role this week to soaking up excess liquidity, helped to explain the shilling's stability, the dealer said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the market was flush with dollars as traders were buying shillings to finance business transactions.</p>
