<title>USA: Monsanto to buy  Holden's, seed distributors.</title>
<headline>Monsanto to buy  Holden's, seed distributors.</headline>
<dateline>ST. LOUIS, Mo. 1997-01-06</dateline>

<p>Monsanto Co said Monday it reached separate agreements to acquire Holden's Foundation Seeds Inc, as well as  Corn States Hybrid Service Inc and  Corn States International, the exclusive worldwide marketing and sales representatives for Holden's products.</p>
<p>The total cost of the acquisitions will be up to $1.02 billion, Monsanto said.  </p>
<p>As a foundation seed company, Holden's produces the germplasm and inbreds -- or parent seeds -- used by retail seed companies to create hybrid seeds, Monsanto said. More than 35 percent of the corn acres planted in the United States use genetic material developed by Holden's, it added.</p>
<p>Corn States and Corn States International, with operations in the United States, Europe and South America, provide Holden's germplasm and specialized services to seed companies worldwide.  </p>
<p>&quot;Holden's germplasm is an important building block. It will provide an excellent delivery mechanism for our biotechnology innovations in corn,&quot; Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro said in a statement.</p>
<p>Monsanto, among other agricultural companies, has developed genetically enhanced crops by implanting genes to deliver specific traits. Those traits include the ability fight off certain insects and tolerance to use of certain herbicides to kill weeds in the field.</p>
<p>Monsanto said the transaction will be completed as soon as possible, subject to government approvals and other terms.  </p>
<p>Monsanto said Holden's corn breed expertise and Corn States' array of services to seed companies will play important roles in increasing the value of Monsanto's other crop development programs, including soybeans, wheat, cotton and rice.</p>
<p>On December 23, 1996, Monsanto's YieldGard corn that is genetically protected against the European corn borer was given final U.S. regulatory approval. Other products in development include Roundup Ready corn, which can withstand Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, and corn that is genetically protected against corn rootworm.</p>
<p>Analysts said last week that Monsanto was expected to purchase Holden's, which would help in its development of biotech crops. The purchase also would be a defensive measure to keep competitors from gaining Holden's.</p>
<p>Monsanto said the acquisitions are an important piece of its strategy. It is in the process of creating a new life sciences company that combines its existing agricultural, food and pharmaceutical businesses. It also seeks to develop new businesses that have synergies with these fields.</p>
<p>Monsanto previously said it would spin off its chemical businesses.</p>
