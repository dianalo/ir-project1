<p>The Polish government on Tuesday gave the formal go-ahead to the privatisation of Bank Handlowy SA, slated for sale to institutional investors and the public by mid-year, the government press office said.</p>
<p>The government has already approved a broad privatisation plan under which 30 percent of Handlowy's shares would be offered to institutional investors, 30 percent sold in a public offer and 30 percent earmarked for future pension funds.</p>
<p>But the goverment said in a statement Bank Handlowy, Poland's oldest and largest commercial bank, was considered a strategic institution and as such needed a formal government clearance for its sale.</p>
<p>&quot;The privatisation of Bank Handlowy which is an institution of special importance for the economy requires a government approval,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the limited resources of the domestic capital market and the large value of Bank Handlowy's assets it is possible to offer domestically only a part of state treasury's shares,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>It said the sale to foreign institutions could be carried out through an issue of depositary receipts.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining part of shares will be sold to several financial institutions and depositary receipts will be issued abroad to foreign investors and this will allow the bank to gain partners for a long-term cooperation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The privatisation plan assumes that the remaining 10 percent of shares would be set aside for Handlowy employees and a planned fund for restitution claims.</p>
<p>The statement said the treasury minister would decide how much and on what conditions Handlowy shares would be made available to its employees.</p>
