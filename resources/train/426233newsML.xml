<p>Rebels entrenched in towns in southern Albania showed no sign of surrendering their weapons on Friday, despite a temporary halt to a military push decreed by President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>Bands of trigger-happy men and youths swarmed around the rebel-held towns, rolling out artillery seized from army depots at the weekend into main squares, on approach roads and hilltops.</p>
<p>Reporters who crossed army lines to reach Tepelene, 200 km (130 miles) south of Tirana in the rugged interior, said the insurgents were rowdy and appeared to be under no proper command.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them were arguing amongst themselves and there were bullets being fired all over the place. No-one seems to be in control,&quot; A Reuter reporter said.</p>
<p>The rebellion, which erupted last Saturday after weeks of protests over the collapse of shady investment schemes, has taken hold in a triangle of territory from the Adriatic port of Vlore east to Tepelene, following a line southwest to the coastal town of Sarande.</p>
<p>A photographer in Sarande, a picturesque port visible from the Greek holiday island of Corfu, said rebels had dug into hilltops at the eastern entrance to the town and erected barricades against any attempt to crush the uprising by force.</p>
<p>Many of the rebels vowed to maintain their armed campaign until Berisha, re-elected to a second five-year term this week by a parliament dominated by his Democrats, stepped down.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a popular uprising and won't stop until Berisha resigns,&quot; former army officer Davar told an evening rally in the main square of the port of Sarande -- in violation of a curfew.</p>
<p>Berisha held a five-hour meeting on Thursday with his ruling Democratic Party and nine opposition groupings that produced an agreement to suspend operations against the heavily armed rebels for 48 hours.</p>
<p>The rebels, in turn, were offered an amnesty if they handed in their weaponry by 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Sunday on condition they had committed no crimes.</p>
<p>&quot;There does not seem to have been a response from the rebels so far,&quot; a government information official said.</p>
<p>The United States welcomed the suspension of military operations as the international community began to mobilise to help Berisha's Democratic Party and the opposition broker a political deal, which may in turn produce a strategy to end the unrest in the south.</p>
<p>Berisha was scheduled to meet Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo whose country currently holds the EU's rotating chairmanship. He held talks on his way to Tirana on Thursday in Rome and Athens -- the two capitals most directly concerned by any flood of migrants if order breaks down in Albania.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of impoverished Albanians made a mass exodus to Italy in 1991 after 45 years of Stalinist rule crumbled. Thousands more crossed illegally over the border into Greece to find work to help families back home.</p>
<p>Some 50 Albanians arrived by boat in southern Italy on Friday after another 29 had made the Adriatic crossing on Wednesday. Italy says it will send them back.</p>
<p>Van Mierlo is the first senior Western minister to visit Albania since it imposed emergency rule on Sunday to quell the outbreak of violence. A delegation from the Council of Europe was also in Tirana and was holding talks with all political parties on Friday.</p>
<p>Berisha last week suggested early elections within 45 days to opposition parties and pledged to step down if his rightists lost power. The opposition said that, given the climate of turmoil and suspicion, the time frame was too short.</p>
