<title>UK: SMITH&amp;NEPHEW SAYS DOING WELL AGAINST RIVALS.</title>

<p>Smith &amp; Nephew said on Tuesday it was performing well against its competitors, particularly in the U.S., where sales grew seven percent in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>The British healthcare group's position was mainly boosted by the constant flow of new products onto the market, chief executive Chris O'Donnell said.</p>
<p>&quot;We got our new products rolling strongly in the U.S.,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Endoscopy sales grew 12 percent due to a new shaver system, while a series of new artificial knees grabbed a five percent share of the U.S. market, O'Donnell said.</p>
<p>He said overall price pressure in the U.S. was subsiding after a very tough 1996. Average price levels came down three percent last year, but the decline so far this year was &quot;a bit less than half that,&quot; O'Donnell said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the trend is upwards,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the bright picture in the U.S., business in Europe deteriorated as governments tightened budgets to meet monetary union requirements.</p>
<p>European sales were flat in the first half after nine percent growth in 1996, O'Donnell said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a significant change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Smith &amp; Nephew has succeeded in winning market share in Germany, its biggest market on the European continent. In France it held or marginally gained market share, O'Donnell said.</p>
<p>Smith &amp; Nephew plans to have factories in India and China, but the brunt of its Asian investments is aimed at boosting its sales force across the continent.</p>
<p>Smith &amp; Nephew earlier reported an 11.75 percent fall in first-half profits which were badly hit by the pound's strength.</p>
<p>&quot;But we believe the underlying business is healthy and will continue to grow going forward,&quot; O'Donnell said.</p>
