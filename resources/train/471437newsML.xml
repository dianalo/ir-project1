<p>Communal unrest in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, has cut daily crude output by 10 percent this week and threatens to disrupt exports, state and foreign oil companies warned on Thursday.</p>
<p>Six installations in the oil-rich Niger Delta, operated by the Anglo-Dutch giant Royal Dutch/Shell, were overrun last Saturday by villagers angry at local government disputes and were still occupied on Thursday. Five more were shut in response to demands from community groups but were not occupied.</p>
<p>Shell, which produces about half the country's daily output of 2.15 million barrels, and state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC) said exports would be disrupted if the disturbances did not end soon.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no cancellations yet, but if things continue beyond where they are today there will be cancellations,&quot; an NNPC official said. Nigeria depends on crude exports for more than 90 percent of its foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>Shell warned customers on Wednesday it may be forced to cancel or delay exports early next month unless it could restore the 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) of production lost since Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are talking about a possible force majeure from April 2, then clearly we need to resume production quickly to avoid that,&quot; a Shell official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shell said it hoped for a swift and peaceful resolution to the crisis which began on Saturday when Ijaw villagers took 127 staff and contractors hostage at six pumping stations west of the Niger river.</p>
<p>Delicate negotiations this week have secured the release of about half the workers, but attempts to free the others received a setback on Thursday when a boat was delayed leaving the oil town of Warri, Shell said.</p>
<p>World oil prices edged higher on news of the threat of reduced exports from Nigeria, the fifth largest producer in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a key supplier to refineries in the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Benchmark Brent Blend crude oil from the North Sea gained 13 cents to $19.42 a barrel by 1631 GMT.</p>
<p>But industry sources said oil prices were partially insulated by ample alternative supplies, notably from Iraq and the North Sea, and by an overhang of unsold Nigerian crude in late March.</p>
<p>Nearly two million barrels of Nigerian Forcados crude were handed back to Nigeria earlier this month by term customers unable to sell them profitably in a weakening market.</p>
<p>Shell said it was confident it could meet all its Forcados commitments for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; but warned that the Bonny export stream, Nigeria's largest at about 580,000 bpd, could be disrupted in early April.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hoping to resume production as soon as possible but the first step is to ensure that the occupations of the flow stations have ceased and that it is safe for our people to return,&quot; said a Shell official.</p>
<p>In the absence of detailed information about damage to the flow stations, the oil company was unable to say how quickly it would be able to return production to normal levels once the occupations ended.</p>
<p>While the current protests over local government arrangements are not aimed directly at Shell, it has often been the target of sustained environmental demonstrations and sabotage. It was forced to withdraw from the volatile Ogoniland region in 1993.</p>
