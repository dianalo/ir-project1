<title>CHINA: California governor says China wrong on fruit fly.</title>

<p>China's concern that California has a problem with Mediterranean fruit fly is wrong and bars access for the state's produce to a potentially huge market, the U.S. state's Governor Pete Wilson said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a misapprehension ... that Medflies are a problem with respect to the export of citrus, grapes, plums, apples and cherries,&quot; Wilson told a new conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the most stringent phyto-sanitary standards that I think are imposed anywhere in the world and we have dealt very effectively with the problem of the Medfly and have disposed of it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Speaking on the last day of a three-week Asian trade tour, Wilson said he did not understand why the Chinese government refused to recognise California as free of the pest.</p>
<p>He raised the issue of non-tariff trade barriers with Minister of Trade Wu Yi while in Beijing earlier this week, he said.</p>
<p>California produces 250 specialty crops -- fruits, vegetables and nuts -- as well as livestock and poultry, he said.</p>
<p>Total 1995 agricultural exports to China were worth $256.79 million, up from just $41.314 million in 1992, according to California Trade and Commerce Secretary Julie Meier Wright.</p>
<p>No breakdown for fruit exports was available, but Wright said fruit did not appear in the top 10.</p>
<p>&quot;China has 1.2 billion people and if you look at the urban areas like Shanghai, there is a reasonable ability to afford these products,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The consumer market for these products, if we had total access, has got to be at least in the tens of millions of dollars,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that prohibitively high tariffs, in some cases up to 60 percent, mean that much of the U.S. produce sold in China, including fruit and poultry, is smuggled in, mostly through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;If the tariffs weren't prohibitive, the smuggling wouldn't be a problem and U.S. produce could enter China legally,&quot; a trade official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>&quot;While we are trying to deal with the access problems in phytosanitary talks, tarrifs are being dealt with by the WTO (World Trade Organisation) separate to quarantine issues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bilateral quarantine talks are currently taking place in California, attended by senior Chinese quarantine officials, a U.S. agriculture official said.</p>
<p>Washington and Beijing will exchange scientific teams in March in a further effort to solve the phytosanitary problems, Wilson said.</p>
<p>Asked if he feared the issue would be dragged out further with no resolution in sight, Wilson said: &quot;Probably.&quot;</p>
<p>Quarantine issues have been an ongoing problem for U.S. exports to China over the past couple of years, affecting the import of wheat from the Pacific northwest and, late last year, poultry.</p>
