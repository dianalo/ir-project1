<p>The Philippines is considering providing refuelling facilities in the disputed Spratly Islands for civilian and military aircraft, military chief General Arnulfo Acedera said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Acedera told Reuters that a renovated airstrip in the Kalayaan group of islands, which he inaugurated on Christmas Day, could be a refuelling point for flights westward from the Philippines, to Vietnam and beyond.</p>
<p>He said no proposal of this nature had been made to Hanoi, but said it was a possibility.</p>
<p>&quot;We have many businessmen going to Vietnam. They go there in their own private aircraft. Safety of air travel between the two countries will be vastly improved.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Philippines wanted to develop the airstrip to provide &quot;turnaround&quot; facilites, which would include refuelling and stocking of fresh provisions and water.</p>
<p>The Spratlys are a cluster of potentially oil-rich but largely uninhabited isles, shoals and reefs in the South China Sea, and are claimed wholly or in part by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
<p>China protested against the opening of the airstrip last week, saying Beijing &quot;enjoys indisputable sovereignty&quot; over the islands and urging the Philippines not to take any action that would harm bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Asked about China's position on the Spratlys, Acedera said: &quot;They can use it (the airstrip) as well, if they have tourists bound towards that area.</p>
<p>&quot;In the same manner, we are of the opinion that the structures on Mischief Reef should be opened to us as well as the other claimant countries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two countries flared last year after China built structures on Mischief Reef, one of the disputed islands, which Manila said could be used as naval support facilities. Beijing says the structures are shelters for fishermen.</p>
<p>Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Philippine President Fidel Ramos agreed during Jiang's visit to Manila in November to shelve differences over the Spratlys and consider cooperation in developing the area.</p>
