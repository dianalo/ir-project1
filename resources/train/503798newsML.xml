<headline>Ascend net up 139 pct, Cascade sales growth slows.</headline>
<dateline>ALAMEDA, Calif. 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ascend Communications Inc on Thursday said first-quarter net income before charges rose 139 percent from the same period a year earlier, while its merger partner Cascade reported a sequential drop in sales.</p>
<p>Ascend said net income for the three months to March 31 rose to $46.3 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $19.4 million, or 15 cents, in the first quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>That was slightly more than Wall Street's consensus estimate of 33 cents a share, according to First Call. With an $18 million one-time charge for purchased research and development tied to its acquisition of InterCon Systems Corp, earnings were $35.1 million, or 27 cents a share, the company said.</p>
<p>First-quarter net sales for the fast-growing maker of remote networking products was $202.4 million, up 120 percent from $92.0 million in the first quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>Westford, Mass.-based Cascade Communications Corp, which issued a profit warning on March 30 and announced Ascend's intention to acquire it in a stock swap, reported earnings in line with its revised target.</p>
<p>For the quarter ended March 29, Cascade reported profit, excluding a $213.1 million one-time charge, of $14.8 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with net income of $10.4 million, or 11 cents a share in the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>Revenues for the first quarter rose 61 percent to $90.3 million from $56 million for the same period in 1996, but that was down 18 percent from $110.3 million for the fourth quarter in an industry where large double-digit sequential quarterly gains are the norm.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not believe that the quarter's revenue performance is the result of any underlying fundamental business issues specific to Cascade,&quot; Cascade President and CEO Daniel Smith said in a statement accompanying the results.  </p>
<p>Analysts said Cascade executives told them in a conference call that some of the company's customers, especially U.S. telephone companies, have increased the capacity utilization of traffic on equipment similar to that sold by Cascade to as high as 90 percent from around 40 percent historically.</p>
<p>As a consequence, demand decreased for Cascade's products, which include frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode switching products.</p>
<p>&quot;Ascend clearly is delivering the numbers,&quot; said Volpe, Welty &amp; Co. analyst Amar Senan.  </p>
<p>The results were released after the market close. Shares of Ascend, which closed down $1.375 at $46.375 on Nasdaq, were mostly firm to slightly easier in after-hours trade, with prices quoted in a range between $46 and $47.625.</p>
<p>Shares of Cascade Communications were at $30.25 in after-hours trade, after closing down $1 at $30.375 in Nasdaq trade.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this is the kiss of death for Cascade. It's probably more a delay in some of their orders,&quot; added Senan, saying he did not expect customers to keep running at such high capacity utilization levels.  </p>
<p>Analysts added they do not expect softness in Cascade's sales to weigh further on shares of rivals such as Newbridge Networks and Cisco Corp.'s StrataCom, which they said are less heavily dependent on U.S. customers.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly this is a company in transition,&quot; one analyst said, adding that its frame relay business, nevertheless, had a book-to-bill greater than one, indicating more orders were booked than product shipped during the quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the bad news was already built into the Cascade stock price,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I think Ascend is the one that is going to determine what the price of the two companies is.&quot;</p>
<p>Ascend's acquisition was initially valued at $3.7 billion, but the value has since slipped on a somber reception from Wall Street, falling to less than $3 billion at one point. The deal is expected to be completed during the summer, analysts said.</p>
<p>Shares of Ascend, which hit a 52-week peak of $78.75 in January but have since slumped. It closed at $52 on March 27, the last trading day before the Cascade acquisition deal was unveiled. It has recovered some territory from a closing at $40.75 on March 31, after the acquisition was announced.</p>
