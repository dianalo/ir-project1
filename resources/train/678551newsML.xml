<title>PAKISTAN: Bhutto lends cautious support to Pakistani's arrest.</title>

<p>Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on Saturday lent cautious support to the controversial capture by the United States of a Pakistani accused of a deadly shooting outside CIA headquarters.</p>
<p>Bhutto, now opposition leader, told Reuters in an interview that her government, forced from power last November, had also tried without success to arrest Mir Aimal Kansi for the January 1993 shooting in Langley, Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not sure about the details of the Kansi case but I do think that governments everywhere should take a strong stand against terrorism,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has come under fire from some of Pakistan's nationalist and religious parties for apparently letting the United States spirit Kansi out of the country earlier this week.</p>
<p>Some politicians and newspapers have accused the government of compromising national sovereignty by handing over a Pakistani citizen to a foreign government without fulfilling legal extradition procedures.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Tuesday Kansi, from Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan, had been delivered abroad by unidentified Afghans to the custody of U.S. authorities and brought back to the United States to face trial.</p>
<p>FBI officials gave no details about Kansi's seizure and would not say if any of those involved would collect a reward of up to $2 million offered for the wanted man.</p>
<p>Bhutto said she did not believe Kansi was arrested by the FBI. &quot;I believe he was handed over by our government to the American authorities. He was a wanted terrorist and we are not in a position to say that he was innocent or guilty. This will have to be proved before a court of law.&quot;</p>
<p>She said when she was prime minister &quot;we had made many attempts to arrest&quot; him. &quot;But he would slip out and I suppose his luck ran out and he was extradited.&quot;</p>
<p>Bhutto herself faced criticism when her government arrested and extradited a U.S. bomb blast suspect, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, in February 1995.</p>
<p>But she said Yousef, who carried an Iraqi passport and was accused of being the brains behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, was taken before a court which allowed his extradition.</p>
<p>Pakistani government officials have refused to comment on Kansi's arrest. Kansi is accused of killing two Central Intelligence Agency employees and wounding three outside the CIA headquarters in Langley.</p>
