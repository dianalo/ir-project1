<p>France's SML union of specialist doctors said on Thursday it was breaking off all negotiations on welfare spending reform with the country's public health insurance fund and called on other doctors to do likewise.</p>
<p>The SML union said it &quot;regrets that all its negotiation efforts with the government have failed to bear fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The SML has no choice but to break off all negotiations in the face of persistant government attempts to massacre the specialist medical practice with additional, unjustifiable, financial constraints,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The SML, one of a few unions representing specialist doctors in private practice, said it &quot;refused to play the accomplice.&quot;</p>
<p>Specialist doctors have been fighting Prime Minister Alain Juppe's decrees on healthcare spending cuts but their campaign has not been backed by general practioners in the MG France union, which back the basic idea of reform.</p>
<p>The spending negotiations were being conducted with the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM), the public health insurance fund.</p>
<p>SML chairman Dinorino Cabrera told Reuters he had written to the other unions representing specialist doctors, the CSMF and the FMF, asking them to follow his union's latest move.</p>
<p>The SML said in its statement it was &quot;calling on all doctors to mobilise&quot; and to join in &quot;action which would start in the coming days.&quot;</p>
<p>The SML, which says it has 5,500 members accounting for a fifth of the medical practice, said it rejected the idea of treating medical spending like an accounting exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;Never have the parliamentary deputies had to fork out from their own pockets for overruns on the national budget,&quot; Cabrera of the SML said.</p>
