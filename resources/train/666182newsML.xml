<p>The new government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo will soon launch economic reforms, including a review of the country's mining and investment rules, Mines Minister Florent Mututulo said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A serious reform will be undertaken in the very near future in order to (make) the following more adaptable in the modern investment climate: the investment code, the mining code and the fiscal,&quot; Mututulo told delegates at a sub-Saharan Oil and Minerals conference.</p>
<p>He said restoring of investor faith in the former Zaire was one of the main concerns of the new government.</p>
<p>Mututulo said Kabila's government intended to re-negotiate the $5 billion debt inherited from former president Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Mututulo -- who said his speech was one of the first by a member of Kabila's government to an international audience -- said the country's economy needed immediate action.</p>
<p>&quot;The present situation is alarming and requires drastic surgery to save the patient,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The objective of Kabila's government was to create a prosperous mining industry which would assist the country's economic recovery.</p>
<p>Mututulo said the new Congo required large chunks of new investment and needed foreign partners.</p>
<p>&quot;At this most critical time when the Congo has finally been liberated...it illustrates our efforts and the need for a massive injection of investment.</p>
<p>&quot;We need new investments to rehabilitate, modernise and revitalise our economic sectors,&quot; he said.</p>
