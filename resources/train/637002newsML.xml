<headline>NY Assembly extends LIPA/Lilco hearings.</headline>

<p>The New York Assembly Committee on Energy will continue its hearings on the Long Island Power Authority's plan to issue $7.2 billion in public debt to purchase the Long Island Lighting Co next week.</p>
<p>The &quot;last road show&quot; hearings had been scheduled for Thursday, committee spokesman Paul Larrabee said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Now the schedule has been extended to permit LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel provide specific answers to modifications in the takeover proposal that have been suggested during the committee's hearings.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to Kessel Wednesday, the chairmen of the Assembly committees on Energy; Corporations, Authorities and Commissions; and Consumer Affairs and  Protection asked him to appear at Thursday's hearings or &quot;an alternative public hearing during the week of June 9 through June 13.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will attend&quot; a hearing to be scheduled next week, Kessel told Reuters.</p>
<p>The letter said &quot;there is serious skepticism by many Long Island residents and businesses regarding specific promises from LIPA/LILCO on rate relief,&quot; financial commitments by ratepayers, and the consequences to Long Island's economy.</p>
<p>It said public concern has centered on four major themes:</p>
<p>-- the extent to which rate reductions will be realized;</p>
<p>-- the extent LILCO shareholders and officers receive compensation beyond the perceived value of the assets at the expense of ratepayers;</p>
<p>-- the necessity of issuing nearly $7.6 billion of debt that residents and businesses of Nassau, Suffolk and Queens counties will be pay for 35 years; and</p>
<p>-- the necessity of maintaining LIPA/LILCO monopoly control while the rest of the state benefits from the price reductions of a competitive energy marketplace.</p>
<p>Among the proposed modifications to the proposal the letter asked Kessel to comment on were several triggered by the &quot;net gain to LILCO stockholders of (about) $2.0 billion&quot; to be proviuded by ratepayers under the contract.</p>
<p>Noting &quot;the use of these funds in currently unrestricted by the agreement you negotiated,&quot; an attachment to the letter said &quot;the lack of any qualifications appears unreasonable,&quot; adding &quot;ratepayers effectively are paying a premium for LILCO assets to assure the LIPA takeover.&quot;</p>
<p>It sought Kessel's opinion on:</p>
<p>-- a condition that LILCO invests about $2.0 billion in the utility's service area.</p>
<p>	  -- conditioning the purchase of LILCO's Nine Mile Point 2</p>
<p>stake on a plan approved by state regulators to operate and eventually decomission the nuclear power plant,</p>
<p>-- discounting the book value of Nine Mile Point 2 to be more consistent with prior testimony of LIPA officials,</p>
<p>-- discounting the purchase price of the Shoreham regulatory asset, and</p>
<p>-- including LILCO's generation plants as part of the proposal in addition to the Shoreham regulatory asset and the transmission and distribution systems on Long Island.</p>
<p>Currently, the plan is for LILCO to retain the generation and merge with Brooklyn Union Gas Co.</p>
<p>Thursdays hearings will be held at Nassau Community College, begining at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT; and at the Knights of Columbus in the Rockaway Beach area of Queens, begining at 1900 EDT/2300 GMT. ((-- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610.))</p>
