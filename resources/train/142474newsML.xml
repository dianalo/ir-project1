<headline>Deutsche - profit trend to continue in Q4 [CORRECTED 07:40 GMT].</headline>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG said on Thursday it expected its positive earnings trend to continue in the final quarter of 1996 after group net profit rose nine percent in the first nine months.</p>
<p>Germany's largest commercial bank said group net profit rose to 1.5 billion marks in the first nine months from 1.4 billion in the year-earlier period while pre-tax profit rose 27.1 percent to 3.0 billion marks from 2.4 billion.</p>
<p>(Corrects year-earlier figure for group net profit from 1.0 billion).</p>
<p>Group operating profit after provisions rose 25.8 percent to 3.49 billion marks, the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The earnings were below analysts' forecasts.  </p>
<p>Analysts had on average predicted a net profit of 1.7 billion marks while forecasts for operating profit averaged 3.62 billion marks and ranged from 3.58 billion marks to 3.68 billion. Deutsche is not holding a news conference.</p>
<p>The bank's share price rose after the results and was quoted up 36 pfennings or 0.4 percent at 71.60 marks in electronic pre-bourse trade.</p>
<p>Analysts had predicted Deutsche's earnings would suffer from added risk provisions to cover the injection of 180 million pounds sterling into its British unit Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM), hit by irregularities at three unit trusts which came to light in September.</p>
<p>But Deutsche made no mention of the affair in its interim report.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the positive earnings development to continue in the final quarter of the year,&quot; Deutsche chief executive Hilmar Kopper said in a statement.</p>
<p>The return on equity before tax rose to 14.3 percent in the first nine months from 12.4 percent.</p>
<p>Risk provisions for loan losses rose to 1.2 billion marks from 1.0 billion, while net interest income after risk provisions edged down 0.9 percent to 6.8 billion marks.</p>
<p>Trading profit jumped to 2.1 billion marks from 1.4 billion and already exceeded the 2.0 billion marks trading profit earned in the whole of 1995, Deutsche said.</p>
<p>Net commission income climbed 25.9 percent to 4.9 billion. Administration costs rose 9.9 percent to 10.9 billion marks.</p>
<p>Deutsche is the only German bank to publish under the more transparent International Accounting Standards. Other banks are also moving to broader disclosure but are still publishing their accounts exclusively according to the German Commercial Code (HGB).</p>
<p>Deutsche has kicked off the nine-month reporting season for Germany's major commercial banks. It will be followed by Bayerische Vereinsbank on Friday.</p>
