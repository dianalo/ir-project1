<p>Former City of London discount houses Gerrard &amp; National and King &amp; Shaxson Holdings, competing in a new and difficult trading environment, are to join forces creating a broking and specialist banking group with 10 billion pounds of funds under management.</p>
<p>The two companies on Friday unveiled the proposed merger, which comprises 17 Gerrard ordinary shares for 25 King &amp; Shaxson shares, valuing King &amp; Shaxson at 53.7 million pounds ($85.25 million).</p>
<p>Gerrard also announced a sharp decline in half-year profits to 6.3 million pounds from 12.1 million. It said margins were slim and profitability disappointing.</p>
<p>&quot;Bringing Gerrard and King &amp; Shaxson together as Gerrard Group accelerates the strategies of each company,&quot; said executive chairman of Gerrard Brian Williamson, who is to become non-executive chairman when the merger is completed.</p>
<p>Since an initial investment in 1982, Gerrard has built up leading futures and financial options broker GNI Holdings, while King &amp; Shaxson has grown a private client stockbroking and fund management business through the purchase and integration of Greig Middleton and Allied Provincial.</p>
<p>A key benefit arising from the merger will be cost savings, which are projected to be not less than five million stg ($7.9 million) annually. Over the course of next year, the new group will move all settlement office administration for the enlarged stockbroking business to Greig Middleton's Glasgow office.</p>
<p>Consolidation of Gerrard and King &amp; Shaxson's money market business will release at least 25 million pounds for investment in the group and future acquisitions, the companies said.</p>
<p>The long-term cost savings arising from the merger will be particularly beneficial for Gerrard, which reported a sharp decline in operating profits and bemoaned the difficult state of trading conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;The introduction of the gilt repo market, reduced turnover in foreign exchange and increasing margin pressure in derivative markets combined to create a particularly challenging trading environment,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although GNL has built up a significant market share in gilt repo, activity has primarily been with professional counterparties and margins are slim and profitability disappointing.&quot;</p>
<p>King &amp; Shaxson in June posted full year pre-tax profits of 6.5 million pounds, up from 3.9 million the year before. This was boosted by exceptional profits of one million pounds from the sale of the Greig Middleton Channel Islands business.</p>
<p>Shares in GNL fell 24 pence to a new 1996 low of 275p on Friday, while King &amp; Shaxson gained 22-1/2p to 185 after earlier touching a new 1996 high of 193. ($ = 0.631 British Pounds Sterling)</p>
