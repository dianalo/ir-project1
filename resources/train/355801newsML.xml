<p>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has filed a third defamation suit against opposition politician Tang Liang Hong, a legal notice published on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>The suit, similar to one filed by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew late last week, charges that Tang slandered Goh in the presence of Straits Times reporter Brendan Pereira on January 10 and in an article in the newspaper on January 11.</p>
<p>Goh's action takes the tally of defamation suits filed by ruling People's Action Party (PAP) leaders against Tang to at least 13.</p>
<p>On Monday, Lee and his son, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, filed a joint defamation suit against Tang for remarks he made at three election rallies on their purchases of Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) apartments.</p>
<p>Goh, Lee and other PAP leaders have also filed a defamation suit against veteran opposition politician Joshua Jeyaretnam.</p>
<p>Tang and Jeyaretnam stood as Workers' Party candidates in a hotly contested multi-party constituency for the city state's general elections on January 2.</p>
<p>The PAP won 81 of 83 parliamentary seats overall and was victorious in that constituency. But Jeyaretnam still got a place in parliament under a constitutional provision for a seat for best-loser if only two opposition members are elected.</p>
<p>At his rally speeches, Tang said he would raise the HPL issue in Parliament if elected and that this was worrying the PAP, the Straits Times newspaper reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Lees argued in their statement of claim that words used by Tang at the rallies meant they were guilty of corruption or other misconduct, the Straits Times said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the Lees when contacted confirmed the Strait Times report.</p>
<p>The suit is the second filed by the Lees over the HPL affair. The first was filed last September over Tang's comments in a Hong Kong-based magazine about discounts given to the Lees for apartments purchased from HPL.</p>
<p>A government inquiry into the HPL matter last year concluded there was no impropriety or misconduct. In his defence against the first suit, Tang had said there was no wrongdoing in the purchases, the daily said.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Goh and Tang were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Tang faces an injunction to freeze his assets or have him set aside up to S$11.2 million (US$7.94 million) for possible damages and legal costs in relation to the earlier lawsuits.</p>
<p>Tang is currently in London consulting lawyers on his defence strategy. He left Singapore shortly after the election campaign saying he had received death threats.</p>
<p>The PAP leaders filed the original defamation suits against Tang for calling them &quot;liars&quot; during the election campaign.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Goh had called Tang a &quot;Chinese chauvinist&quot; dangerous to Singapore's racial harmony. Tang denied the charges and filed police reports saying the allegations were groundless and intended to harm his reputation.</p>
