<p>China said on Thursday that Guatemala's ties with Taiwan had destroyed any basis for cooperation from Beijing in the United Nations.</p>
<p>Guatemala's invitation to Taiwan's Foreign Ministry to attend the December 29 signing of a peace treaty that ended 36 years of civil war had hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;This action... has destroyed the political basis for cooperation between Guatemala and China within the United Nations,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>Shen stopped short of saying Beijing would veto a proposed U.N. peace-keeping mission to monitor the end of Guatemala's guerrilla war but accused Guatemala of hypocrisy in its dealings with Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Guatemalan authorities not only... do things that harm China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also ask for China's cooperation in the U.N. Security Council,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>China has withheld support for a United Nations' Security Council resolution to send 155 U.N. peace-keepers to Guatemala because of that country's close ties with Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rebel province.</p>
<p>Diplomats have said they believe Beijing will not veto the measure but is trying to wring some concessions from Guatemala -- perhaps a high-level visit and an eventual trade mission to slowly wean the Central American country from Taiwan.</p>
<p>Guatemala has vowed to maintain official relations with Taiwan despite the heavy pressure from China.</p>
<p>Taiwan bestows considerable economic aid on Guatemala, one of less than 30 mostly small, impoverished states in Central America and Africa that recognise Taipei instead of Beijing.</p>
<p>China and Taiwan have been bitter political rivals since the two were separated at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>Beijing has sought to push Taipei into diplomatic isolation in its quest to bring the island under communist control.</p>
