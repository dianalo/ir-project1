<headline>US corporate bond issuance seen slow despite rally.</headline>

<p>U.S. corporate bond issuance is expected to remain relatively slow this week, despite a rally in the Treasury market triggered by a positive inflation report on Tuesday morning, syndicate officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;There just aren't that many issuers waiting to tap the market this week,&quot; said one high-grade syndicate source.</p>
<p>A junk bond syndicate official said the Treasury rally could improve the pricing on the few high-yield deals that are in the pipeline currently.</p>
<p>He noted, &quot;The real hope is that a firmer Treasury market could lead to a pickup in (mutual) fund flows.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the high-yield market, Copamex Industrias SA de CV is expected to sell $200 million in seven-year senior subordinated notes in a 144 offering late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Price talk on the notes, rated B1/BB, is 11 percent to 11.5 percent or 400 basis points to 450 basis points over the seven-year Treasury, market sources said.</p>
<p>Citicorp Securities Inc is the lead underwriter. Copamex is the leading integrated paper products producer in Mexico.</p>
<p>Also, Exide Holdings Europe SA is expected to price a rare mark-denominated junk-bond offering to European and American investors later this week.  </p>
<p>Price talk on the 150 million mark offering of seven-year senior notes, rated B1/B, is 375 basis points to 400 basis points over the seven-year bund, market sources said.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley &amp; Co is the underwriter of the offering. Exide, the European unit of Exide Corp, is a manufacturer of industrial battery products.</p>
<p>In the high-grade market, a handful of new deals are expected for later this week:</p>
<p>-NatWest is expected to sell $500 million in perpetual bonds via JP Morgan Securities.  </p>
<p>-Service Corp International, a Houston-based funeral home company, may sell $400 million in seven- and 12-year debt securities via JP Morgan.</p>
<p>-A&amp;P is expected to issue $300 million in 10-year and 30-year bonds in a 144a private placement via Morgan Stanley later in the week.</p>
<p>-Food Lion Inc is seen offering $300 million in 10-year bonds via Salomon Brothers Inc and NationsBanc Capital Markets Inc later this week.</p>
