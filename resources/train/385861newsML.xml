<p>A swelling revolt by intellectuals against an illiberal immigration bill has breathed new life into a long-dormant tradition pitting France's great minds against its political rulers.</p>
<p>Gallic thinkers from Voltaire to Emile Zola, and from Jean-Paul Sartre to his foe Albert Camus, have frequently twinned intellectual achievement with political activism.</p>
<p>But after France's first Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, took power in 1981, intellectuals who for the most part supported him largely shunned the political stage.</p>
<p>Nor was the intelligentsia the spark behind the current campaign against a bill requiring citizens to report to police when foreign guests leave their homes -- the most wide-ranging such protest in years.</p>
<p>It was film-makers urging civil disobedience who launched the bandwagon, since joined by writers, academics, and lawyers.</p>
<p>&quot;In the 1980s, political movements launched outside traditional parties were the work not of intellectuals but of show-business figures or associations, like SOS Racisme,&quot; said Michel Winock, co-author of a &quot;who's who&quot; of the intelligentsia.</p>
<p>Intellectuals mostly steered clear of domestic politics, although some prominent figures campaigned for intervention in Somalia, Bosnia and Chechnya. The horrors of the civil war in the former French colony Algeria have largely met with silence.</p>
<p>Writer Jean d'Ormesson, a member of the prestigious French Academy, said intellectuals had been now jolted into &quot;a great awakening&quot; by the remorseless rise of the far-right, anti-immigration National Front.</p>
<p>&quot;Many wanted to avoid the criticism that they did not do all in their power to slow the rise of (Front leader) Jean-Marie Le Pen,&quot; d'Ormesson wrote in the conservative daily Le Figaro.</p>
<p>Winock said one of the intellectuals' and artists' motives was to prevent the centre-right government pandering to extreme-right voters by &quot;hunting on the Front's terrain&quot;.</p>
<p>The campaign against the immigration bill began within days of the National Front winning a fourth southern town, Vitrolles, in municipal elections this month.</p>
<p>Winock said the protest has much in common with the Dreyfus scandal at the turn of the century -- the first time that French intellectuals had collectively engaged in political combat.</p>
<p>The notorious miscarriage of justice in which a Jewish army officer was framed on spying charges and sent to the Devil's Island penal colony before eventually being cleared, divided French families in a web of anti-semitism and national pride.</p>
<p>&quot;As in the Dreyfus affair, there is a divide between the political class -- the government and the parliamentarians -- and the intellectuals. The third actor is public opinion, and it is divided,&quot; Winock said.</p>
<p>But intellectuals are by no means united.</p>
<p>The National Front has made much of the elitist nature of the current protest, charging that its leaders are intellectuals from chic Parisian neighbourhoods, totally out of touch with ordinary French people in depressed immigrant neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>One prominent intellectual, philosopher Alain Finkielkraut, although opposed to the bill, said the efforts of a privileged few to to tell the lower classes what to think would backfire.</p>
<p>&quot;Anti-racist pleas have so far only resulted in creating more racists,&quot; said Jean Daniel, editor of the left-leaning weekly Le Nouvel Observateur.</p>
<p>Serge July, publisher of the daily Liberation, argued in an editorial that the campaign must broaden its social base to counter the populist Front with a truly popular movement.</p>
