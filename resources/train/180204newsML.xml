<p>Recent economic data shows that the Japanese economy is on a recovery path, a senior Bank of Japan (BOJ) official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Indicators in the last two to three months show that the slight setback seen in the August 'tankan' survey was indeed a temporary one,&quot; the official, an adviser to the BOJ governor, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said data concerning inventory adjustment, private consumption and capital investment had shown an improvement during that period, confirming the central bank's view that the setback was only temporary.  </p>
<p>&quot;Data such as machinery orders and industrial production have shown an improvement. Private consumption -- for example, automobile sales -- have also picked up recently,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The tankan is a quarterly corporate survey conducted by the BOJ and is closely watched by the financial markets as a clue to its future monetary policy.</p>
<p>In the last survey released in August, the diffusion index for major manufacturers, a key index, had worsened unexpectedly and BOJ officials had said it was due mainly to a prolonged inventory adjustment in industries such as paper/pulp and steel.</p>
