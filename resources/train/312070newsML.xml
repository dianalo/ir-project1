<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle Thursday sold at $66.00 per cwt in light volume, unchanged from the bulk of this week's sales and $1.00 higher than last week, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 1,600 head sold in Kansas and no sales were reported for the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, they said.</p>
<p>Most of this week's showlist was sold. There were about 78,000 head sold in the Panhandle and 103,100 in Kansas, according to USDA.</p>
<p>Extreme cold the past week slowed weight gains at most feedlots as cattle struggled to stay warm, sources said.  </p>
<p>Temperatures were expected to warm this weekend, with readings early next week projected at 50 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas and the Panhandle, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Warmer temperatures could give cattle a chance to put on some weight. Many already were running light from feedlots being extremely current and from the recent cold, they said.</p>
<p>The lighter weight cattle should result in smaller beef production, compared with a year ago, which could continue to underpin fed cattle prices, market sources said.</p>
