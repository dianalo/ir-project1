<p>The regulation and supervision of financial institutions will be beefed up this year to protect consumers, with special emphasis on the role of auditors, Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking in parliament during a debate on the Insurance Amendment Bill, she agreed with calls for the strengthening of the Office for Serious Economic Offences and the commercial division of the police, while stepping up public education programmes about possible insurance scams.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is one area that we tend to neglect, which I would feel is probably more important than any of the others because it is the route to them, and that is the role of the accounting profession and in particular that of auditors,&quot; Marcus said.</p>
<p>She said she was concerned that current legislation on the regulation of financial services being prepared did not take this into account.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not satisfied with the approach that is being taken,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the role of auditors needs to have a much higher profile so that long before you come to the question of what was the problem, the position taken by the auditors and the accounting profession must be much more transparent.&quot;</p>
<p>It was particularly important that the public could feel that if an auditor closed off a set of books, it could be taken at face value and accepted as part of an enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>She was also concerned about the fragmentation of the supervision and regulation of financial services and was discussing this with the authorities concerned.</p>
