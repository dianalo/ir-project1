<title>BELGIUM: Belgian bonds await exchange auction.</title>

<p>The looming, and possibly large, linear bond exchange auction on Tuesday proved the main focus of attention for the Belgian market on Monday and will dominate tomorrow's session, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of supply is expected at Tuesday's auction. It will be the last opportunity for people to either swap out of OLO 15 or hold it until maturity,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>OLO 15, which has 98 billion Belgian francs outstanding, matures this month.</p>
<p>&quot;People are watching to see if there are interesting terms on offer for investors,&quot; the trader added.  </p>
<p>The Belgian Treasury is offering OLOs 27 (4.00 pct, Jan 2000), 6 (9.00 pct, March 2003), 19 (6.50 pct, March 2005) and 26 (6.25 pct, March 2007) in exchange for OLO 15 and OLO 8.</p>
<p>Traders said the prospect of the auction capped price rises elsewhere in the market on a fairly quiet Monday, with some end investors seen but activity mainly confined to professionals.</p>
<p>&quot;There was good interest in OLO 15 today as well as in OLO 26 and, to a lesser extent, OLOs 19 and 24,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market strength during the day -- after a four-day break -- was largely attributable to stronger Bunds and rising U.S. Treasuries.  </p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark March 2007 OLO ended at 5.81 percent against Wednesday's closing 5.87, with the spread over Bunds 11 basis points against 10.</p>
<p>The June futures contract was 37 basis points up at 121.64 having spent the morning with gains hovering around 17 basis points.</p>
