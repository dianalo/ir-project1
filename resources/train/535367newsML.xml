<p>The benchmark 48-hour and its 24-hour stablemate reversed earlier firmness to close slightly weaker on Thursday, after local and foreign dealers covered short dollar positions on a late gain in U.S. long bond yields, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks were short on dollars and decided to step in to square positions when they saw the U.S. long bond was under pressure; that is why the peso turned around,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The 48-hour peso 24-hour contracts ended 1.2 centavos and 0.5 of a centavo weaker, respectively, at 7.8710/7.8760 and 7.8620/7.8670 per dollar.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32 to yield 7.12 percent in late trade.</p>
<p>Dealers said brokers had also decided to cover short dollar positions ahead of inflation data that were expected shortly after the close of trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened short (on dollars) because dealers thought inflation figures would be good, but they ended up reconsidering and bought back dollars,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of financial firms MXAAP showed they expected consumer inflation for April 1-15 to be an avaerage of 0.64 percent.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, several dealers in late trade said they were expecting consumer prices to have risen by 0.72 percent.</p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had earlier closed 2.6 centavos firmer at 7.8430/7.8470 per dollar.</p>
