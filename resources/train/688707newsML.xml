<p>The Czech PX50 fell on Thursday with the index's most heavily capitalised banking issue, Komercni Banka, once again leading the decliners.</p>
<p>Komercni, which has lost 10 percent of its value this week, dropped 20 crowns to 1,720. Dealers said the bank was still being hit by concerns over high interest rates.</p>
<p>Although the central bank lowered the last resort Lombard rate to 23 percent on Thursday from the previous 50 percent, the discount rate was left untouched at 13.0 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The worries are not going away because high rates mean a more risky loan portfolio for Komercni,&quot; said one dealer.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere on the index, SPT Telecom recoverd to close unchanged at 3,400 while CEZ fell four crowns to 901.</p>
<p>Dealers said the index's short term prospects were not good. There were no new factors on the horizon which could entice foreign investors back to the Czech Republic in suficient numbers to boost the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the PX50 will stay below 500 (next week),&quot; said Ivo Suchy of ING Barings.</p>
