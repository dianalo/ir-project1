<p>Fascinating facts:</p>
<p>--Barcelona were the first-ever Spanish league champions in 1929 and share with Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao the honour of never having been relegated from the Spanish first division.</p>
<p>--The reserve teams of both Barcelona and Real play in the Spanish second division but they would only be promoted if the first teams were relegated.</p>
<p>--As recently as 1979, Real Madrid B, then known as Castilla, reached the final of the Spanish Cup, which they lost to the Real Madrid first team 6-1.</p>
<p>--Latin singing idol Julio Iglesias was once a goalkeeper for one of Real's reserve teams and only took up music because of an injury.</p>
<p>--Barcelona are universally known as Barca, with a cedilla 'c'. Real are known as 'el Madrid' ('the Madrid'), or 'el Real'.</p>
<p>--The prefix 'Real' which means 'royal' is also held by many other clubs, including 10 in the first division, although in some cases it is rarely used.</p>
<p>--The Real Madrid club shield incorporates a crown to reflect its royal patronage. The club play in an all white strip, and their fans are sometimes called 'merengues' (meringues) as a result.</p>
<p>--Barcelona's claret and blue colours are incorporated into the club shield alongside the red and yellow stripes of the Catalan flag and the red cross of Sant Jordi who appears in England as Saint George, slayer of dragons.</p>
<p>--The forthcoming play-off for the Spanish basketball league championship will also put together Real and Barcelona.</p>
