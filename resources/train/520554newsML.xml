<p>Armed Libyan policemen and soldiers on Friday forced more than 200 Palestinian refugees to leave their tent camp on the Libyan-Egyptian border and to go back to Libya, travellers and Egyptian security officials said.</p>
<p>The travellers said they saw the police and soldiers beat the refugees to make them board buses which drove them into Libya.</p>
<p>The Palestinians were deported to the camp in 1995 at the order of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi who wanted to punish the Palestinian leadership for making peace with Israel.</p>
<p>The refugees have been living in appalling conditions in a tented encampment in no-man's-land between the Egyptian and Libyan border posts near Salloum on the Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>Libya reversed its policy on the refugees in January, saying it was not possible for them to go home to the Palestinian-ruled territories but the Palestinians -- who were asked to pack and leave at short notice -- refused to return, saying they would rather go to Egypt or the self-rule areas instead.</p>
<p>The peace agreements give Israel the right to control entry into the self-rule areas.</p>
<p>Egypt would not let them in unless they could prove a third country would give them residence. It has made some exceptions in cases of emergency health problems.</p>
<p>Many of the Palestinians have said they do not want to return to Libya because they do not know what awaits them there. Libyan officials who tried to persuade them to return in January said those who were employed could go back to their jobs.</p>
<p>The Palestinians had been in Libya as workers, students or with their respective families.</p>
