<title>CANADA: Petro-Canada group to drill east coast well.</title>

<p>A group of energy companies led by Petro-Canada said on Tuesday they planned to drill a well off the coast of Newfoundland to delineate a discovery made in 1981.</p>
<p>The well, to be drilled in September at Hebron on Newfoundland's Grand Banks, is the latest in a flurry of oil projects announced in the region.</p>
<p>Hebron is about 37 km (23 miles) southeast of the Hibernia field, which is slated to start pumping oil at the end of this year.  </p>
<p>Petro-Canada is operator of the well and has a 21.9 percent interest. Partners include Mobil Corp unit Mobil Oil Canada with 36.8 percent, Chevron Corp unit Chevron Canada Resources with 31.9 percent and Norsk Hydro with 9.4 percent.</p>
<p>All are partners in Hibernia.</p>
<p>The well location is three km northeast of the Hebron I-13 discovery well drilled in 1981.</p>
<p>The companies said they intended to use the Bill Shoemaker, a semi-submersible drilling rig owned by the Sedco-Forex division of Schlumberger Ltd, for the well after Amoco Corp unit Amoco Canada Petroleum Co Ltd uses it to drill its own location at nearby West Bonne Bay.</p>
<p>The firms said they expected to spud, or start drilling, the well in September and it would take 30 days to complete.</p>
<p>Oil had been discovered at the Hebron I-13 well and at another nearby location, West Ben Nevis B-75 to the northeast.</p>
<p>The companies said they agreed to a strategy of evaluating development potential of the Hebron area by identifying new reservoirs and possible producing fields. The new Hebron well would determine if there was oil in the undrilled Ben Nevis geological zone.</p>
<p>A 3-D seismic program was planned for the area and other blocks this summer, they said.</p>
