<p>Hong Kong trading house Jardine Matheson, which has overcome historic odds to enter communist China's market, said on Wednesday that Beijing's rival Taiwan also figured into its Asian development strategy.</p>
<p>But the company played down controversial statements made by executives of its Taiwan subsidiary -- including chairman Chang Liang -- that it planned to invest T$6-12 billion (US$215-430 million) in Taiwan over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Jardine Matheson business have ongoing investment plans in Taiwan as they do in many Asian countries, there are no specific investment targets,&quot; Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The level and timing of investment will depend upon the performance of the businesses and opportunities which arise.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan's top financial newspaper caused a stir on Wednesday with a page-one story quoting Chang as saying Jardine planned a major Taiwan expansion and took special note of the disclosure's sensitive timing -- just 13 days before Hong Kong's return to Chinese sovereignty after 156 years of British rule.</p>
<p>In recent years, Jardines has endeavoured to adjust to Hong Kong's new reality as London's influence has waned and Beijing's grown. Aside from being Hong Kong's top private-sector employer, it has more than 70 joint ventures in the communist mainland.</p>
<p>Jardine Taiwan chief Chang was quoted by the Commercial Times as saying investing in Nationalist-ruled Taiwan -- which has defied Beijing for nearly 50 years -- reflected nothing more than prudent business strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to diversify the group's risk, Jardine Matheson has selected several Asia-Pacific countries that enjoy high economic growth, such as the Philippines, Thailand and Taiwan, to undertake large-scale investments,&quot; Chang said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taiwan market is especially seen as a major investment area,&quot; Chang told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Chang and other Jardines executives contacted by Reuters took pains to note that Jardines remained fully committed to its huge Hong Kong and mainland China interests and that its moves in Taiwan should not be seen as contrary to that commitment.</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Group said US$560 million of its $975 million in 1996 capital spending went into the Asia Pacific region. Some T$1-2 billion (US$36-72 million) a year is poured into the group's Taiwan operations, a Taipei executive said.</p>
<p>The executive said Jardines was considering investing in a Taiwan supermarket joint venture, a container cargo terminal and unspecified firms listed on the Taiwan stock exchange.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known how Beijing would interpret a Jardines expansion in Taiwan, seen by China as a renegade province since a 1949 civil war split left the island in the hands of the defeated Chinese Nationalists.</p>
<p>Jardines angered China when it moved its domicile to Bermuda from Hong Kong in 1984 -- just after Beijing and London signed a pact agreeing to Hong Kong's 1997 return to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>The group's companies were delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange in 1994 and 1995, relisting in Singapore.</p>
<p>Both moves bolstered China's view of Jardines as a British partisan.</p>
