<headline>OPTIONS-Bund vols ease after FOMC, but underpinned.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-21</dateline>

<p>LIFFE Bund options' volatilities eased back on Wednesday, trimming recent gains, after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to hold rates steady.</p>
<p>The Fed's inaction has moved the spotlight onto the July meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) when traders said interest rates are almost certain to be hiked.</p>
<p>This prospect kept Bund vols relatively underpinned.</p>
<p>Options activity centred around the expiry on Thursday of the June contract on June futures as players covered positions established on the possibility of a U.S. rate rise. Some cashed in on profits racked up on Tuesday when vols spiked up.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been heavy trading in out-of-the-money Bund puts and calls on the June,&quot; said a salesman at a European bank in London.</p>
<p>Most active June strikes were 101.50, 102.00 and 102.50. By 1400 GMT, the June Bund future on LIFFE was at 101.42, down 20 basis points.</p>
<p>Some players took profits realised through gamma trades that featured heavily in recent days. These involved buying out-of-the-money calls and puts based on a forecast of a sharp movement in the underlying Bunds.</p>
<p>&quot;We had the sharp move so the gamma has worked,&quot; said the salesman.</p>
<p>Gamma is the measure of the rate of change in the delta of the underlying asset price.</p>
<p>The implied volatility on the July options on September Bund futures at the 101.00 strike traded at 5.30 percent compared with a close of 5.59 percent on Tuesday. August options, also on September futures, were trading down slightly at 5.39 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's coming off marginally but not as much as one would have thought,&quot; said the salesman.</p>
<p>September futures were down 26 at 100.33.</p>
<p>Vols should continue to dip, but less so on forward contracts such as August which reflects the prospect of a future U.S. rate hike, he said. July should find good support just above the 5.00 percent level.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still a bit of a bearish market,&quot; said a trader at a U.S house. &quot;But if it moves back down drastically a lot of locals will come back, pushing vols higher.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders recommended short term strategies ahead of the next Fed meeting, such as a put spread at 100.00/99.00 strikes. This should take into account further possible slides in Bunds.</p>
