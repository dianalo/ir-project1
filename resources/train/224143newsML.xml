<p>Southeast Asian buyers are mulling purchases of up to 120,000 tonnes of soymeal for early 1997 delivery but markets in other products are plodding along in a near-comatose state, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;For February alone, the Malaysians are looking at 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of meal. The Indonesians are also looking at about the same amount. Thailand is thinking of 20,000 tonnes of meal,&quot; a senior dealer with a European trading house told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;The amount of meal involved is accurate. But those countries are just asking around for prices and it may take some time for them to step in,&quot; a U.S. trader added.</p>
<p>Major purchases of meal before the end of 1996 appear unlikely, the traders said. Buyers in Southeast Asia are looking for a price of around US$290 a tonne C&amp;F.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything above that is out of the question,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>U.S. soymeal is currently quoted at between $303-$308 a tonne C&amp;F on board a Panamax for January/February shipment, down slightly from $305-$315 a tonne C&amp;F last week, traders said.  </p>
<p>Indian-origin soymeal is indicated at about $305-$310 a tonne C&amp;F for January/February delivery on a Tweendecker compared with $310-$314 a tonne last.</p>
<p>Aside from soymeal, the rest of the physical grains and oilseeds market in Southeast Asia languished in the doldrums.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the trade is in a coma right now. Nobody wants to make an offer,&quot; a dealer for a Singapore-based commodity company said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're having an early Christmas vacation. There are just no aggressive features in the market at the moment,&quot; a dealer for a U.S. trading house added.  </p>
<p>Traders said ample stocks in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia had sidelined corn buyers.</p>
<p>&quot;We're getting nothing on the corn side. Everybody is on a hand-to-mouth basis. There may be some buying if corn falls to around $2.60 to $2.65 a bushel,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) December corn contract closed on Wednesday 1-1/4 U.S. cents down at $2.72 a bushel.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers were thinking it would fall to as low as $2.50 a few weeks ago, but they'd be happy if they get it at $2.60 now,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;I don't see prices going significantly higher, but I don't see them going significantly lower either.&quot;  </p>
<p>A rumour that Malaysia bought 16,000 tonnes of feedwheat was quickly discounted by traders. No other details were available.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be possible, but it's unlikely,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Several regional traders were also looking closely at the possibility of Chinese corn exports in first quarter 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's going to happen, it should happen sometime soon. But you just don't hear anything right now,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Most traders have said Chinese corn exports may reach anywhere from one to two million tonnes although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has said that exports may not exceed 500,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>&quot;Assuming the ban is lifted, the amount of corn actually exported will depend on world prices. Given current Chinese domestic and international corn prices, that amount is unlikely to exceed 500,000 tonnes,&quot; the USDA report released earlier this month said.</p>
<p>&quot;With prices the way they are, I think the USDA is right,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The price of U.S. corn bound for Southeast Asia was quoted by regional traders at around $145-$150 a tonne C&amp;F for January/February shipment on board a Panamax vessel against a quote last week of $150-$152 a tonne C&amp;F.  </p>
<p>U.S. soybeans were priced here at around $300-$308 a tonne C&amp;F for January/February shipment on a Panamax from $308-$310 a tonne C&amp;F the previous week, dealers said.</p>
<p>The subdued state of the market will probably persist until the end of the year, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;This year is over. There's really no point in chasing the prices,&quot; a trader said. &quot;It would be better to just enjoy the Christmas break.&quot;</p>
