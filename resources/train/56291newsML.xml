<p>The car making unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and China's biggest motor coach maker agreed on Monday after three years of complicated negotiations to set up a $95.5 million joint venture to make coaches and chassis.</p>
<p>However, differences between two other Chinese carmakers were troubling plans for a joint venture to build multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), said Helmut Werner, chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz AG.</p>
<p>Werner and Ju Baocai, chairman of Yangzhou Motor Coach Manufacturer General, signed the agreement to set up Yaxing-Benz Ltd in Yangzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz and Yangzhou Motor will each hold a 50 percent stake in the venture, which will have an annual production capacity of 7,000 tourist buses and 12,000 chasis, executives of the two companies said.</p>
<p>The venture gives Mercedes-Benz a foothold in the world's biggest bus market, Werner told a news conference after signing the agreement in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;This joint project opens a highly promising perspective for us in the largest and most attractive bus and coach markets in the world,&quot; Werner said.</p>
<p>A Chinese source familiar with the deal said the vehicles produced would be the first domestically manufactured buses to meet tough rules introduced by the Communications Ministry, and could be operated along motorways.</p>
<p>Currently, only imported buses can ply such routes.</p>
<p>Tough negotiations had dragged on for three years. &quot;The process of the negotiations was complicated,&quot; Ju of Yangzhou Motor told reporters.</p>
<p>The venture's first coach was expected to roll off the production line in early 1997, said Peter Fietzek, a board member of Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p>The duration of the joint venture is 30 years, executives said. Mercedes-Benz had pledged to transfer technology to the venture, which hopes to break even in three years.</p>
<p>The venture also has its eyes on the overseas market. Its exports were forecast to account for 20 percent of its annual sales volume within 10 years, Yangzhou Motor's Ju said.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz also was in negotiations with Sanxing Motor in the southern province of Guangdong and Hainan Automotive Factory in the southern island province of Hainan to jointly produce multi-purpose vehicles, Werner said.</p>
<p>However, he said that the two Chinese carmakers had differences that needed to be ironed out before a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz could be set up. He declined to elaborate on the problems.</p>
<p>Talks on the $1 billion MPV project have been going on for 18 months, Werner said, describing the proposed venture as a &quot;very attractive opportunity...a new but necessary experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The schedule is basically unchanged,&quot; Werner said of the project.</p>
<p>He also said the two Chinese carmakers were not the choice of Mercedes-Benz but had been imposed on the firm by Beijing.</p>
<p>Foreign manufacturers are eager to penetrate China's car market, which is forecast to grow by 27 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>China wants to boost private car purchases, but of the 1.6 million cars on its roads, fewer than 50,000 are owned by individuals. In addition, a recent crackdown on the purchases of luxury cars by officials has sent sales into a tailspin.</p>
<p>In 1995, China's eight biggest auto makers produced 325,000 passenger cars, against the target of 420,000 set at the start of the year, and compared with total national output capacity of one million.</p>
