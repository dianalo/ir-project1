<p>The Indian cabinet on Tuesday relaxed state control and set more transparent criteria for the setting up of new sugar mills, for which government permission is required in the form of licences.</p>
<p>&quot;Pending de-licensing, some simplification of procedures is taking place,&quot; Industry Secretary N. Mohanty told reporters in New Delhi after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>India dismantled licensing in most industries under an economic reform programme launched in 1991, but has taken a gradual path in easing controls on sugar mills.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, a proposal to set up a new sugar mill will no longer need the approval of the Food Ministry, and only the Industry Ministry will decide on the granting of the licences, Mohanty said.</p>
<p>But the Food Ministry's views would be considered, he added.</p>
<p>The government will give preference in granting licences to sugar factories involving larger manufacturing capacities, modern technology and development of integrated complexes to use raw material generated in sugar-making, he said.</p>
<p>The government decided to continue with a rule that new sugar factories will be licensed only if they have a minimum economic capacity of 2,500 tonnes of cane crushed per day.</p>
<p>Officials said the government needed to encourage higher capacities, as the average capacity in India was only 1,914 tonnes of cane crushed per day as against an international standard of 10,000 tonnes per day.</p>
<p>Until now, a new sugar mill could be set up only if there was no other mill within 25 km (15.6 miles) of its proposed site and this could be eased to 15 km (9.4 miles) in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>Henceforth, licences will be issued as long as the distance between a proposed mill site and an existing mill was not less than 15 km, Mohanty said.</p>
<p>The cabinet also decided to consider district as a geographical unit in deciding on the grant of new sugar mill licences, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In case more than one application is received from any unit of operation, priority wil be given to the application received earlier,&quot; the Industry Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;All applications for expansion of the existing factories will be cleared automatically,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic criterion for grant of licences for new sugar units would be cane availability or the potential for development of sugarcane or both,&quot; the statement said.</p>
