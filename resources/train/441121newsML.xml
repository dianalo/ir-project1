<headline>Stocks fall, dollar rises after U.S. data.</headline>

<p>Stock and bond markets retreated but the dollar rose on Thursday after U.S. retail sales and jobs data appeared to strengthen the argument for a rise in American interest rates.</p>
<p>Wall Street plunged more than 60 points in the first few minutes of trade, adding to the woes of European bourses that had been languishing all day, with German stocks particularly weak.</p>
<p>The dollar rallied close to 1.70 marks after the foreign exchange market saw the sales data and a bigger than expected fall in weekly jobless claims pointing to a rate rise.</p>
<p>But the 30-year U.S. long bond fell half a point to yield 6.92 percent, dragging stocks down, Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds are pulling stocks down. The market is high, and the economic news this morning raises fresh fears of an interest rate hike.&quot;</p>
<p>Commerce Undersecretary Everett Ehrlich said the 0.8 percent rise in retail sales figures for February showed the U.S. economy in the first quarter looked &quot;very strong&quot; with consumers going &quot;gangbusters&quot; on spending.</p>
<p>&quot;What we've seen for the first quarter looks very strong,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television. &quot;If you take a look at the numbers we have so far, the first quarter is moving up from three to four (percent growth) and perhaps beyond,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 25, analysts said the numbers had probably bolstered the case for a rates tightening.</p>
<p>Fears the Fed may be tempted to make a pre-emptive strike on inflation by raising interest rates already had investors worried on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>That was reflected in a fall in German and British government bonds and a significant slide in German shares.</p>
<p>London and Paris dropped, too, but the falls were nowhere as bad as Frankfurt where floor trade ended with the 30-share DAX index losing 1.92 percent to 3,349.81.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's losses were extended in later screen trading and traders predicted the German bourse was likely to remain under pressure in the near-term.</p>
<p>However, some traders argued the losses were not particularly dramatic given the DAX had gained some 20 percent in the last 10 weeks and a bout of profit-taking had long been anticipated.</p>
<p>Despite 26 of the 30 shares in the DAX index posting losses in the bourse session, telephone monopoly Deutsche Tekelom and carmaker BMW AG bucked the trend.</p>
<p>Telekom ended trade up 1.20 marks at 36.85 marks after hitting a new high at 37 marks. BMW shares hit a new record at 1,312 marks and ended trade up 23.50 marks at 1,291 marks.</p>
