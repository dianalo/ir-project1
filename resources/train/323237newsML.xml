<p>Brent crude futures in Asia were lower on Tuesday with $22.50 on March once again being tested, brokers said.</p>
<p>March was last traded at $22.53 per barrel, down five cents from London's settlement on Monday. London squeezed out modest gains, but the market was volatile amid thin volume.</p>
<p>NYMEX February crude extended overnight losses, last trading on ACCESS at $25.06 per barrel, down 17 cents from New York. The contract expires later on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Forecasts of mild temperatures in the U.S. northeast hurt heating oil in New York, where the February contract shed 1.50 cents to 66.94 cents per gallon. Prices consolidated on ACCESS early in Asia with February showing a 0.01 cent gain.</p>
<p>However, the March contract continued to slide, falling 0.11 cent to 65.96 cents after losing 1.12 in New York.</p>
<p>The front-month Brent contract successfully closed above $22.50 on Friday and Monday in London, but brokers said the support was being severely tested. It hit an intraday low of $22.29 on Monday before rebounding.</p>
