<title>USA: U.S. stock index futures end up in quiet trading.</title>
<headline>U.S. stock index futures end up in quiet trading.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-03</dateline>

<p>U.S. stock index futures finished higher with March Standard and Poor's 500 near session highs amid afternoon shortcovering.</p>
<p>Traders noted strength in technology issues and said resilience in the face of Treasury bond losses earlier in the day also helped fuel the recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little bit of a rally after the market has been down for so long,&quot; one S&amp;P 500 futures floor source said. He attributed the late buying to short-covering and said activity was light.</p>
<p>The upmove gained speed after T-bond futures closed.  </p>
<p>A heavy T-bond tone amid strong U.S. data had weighed on March S&amp;Ps earlier in the day, but March managed to shake off that pressure and drift higher. In the afternoon rally, March reached 796.30, just shy of Friday's high of 797.80.</p>
<p>The February U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management index and January construction spending kept a temporary early lid on T-bonds and S&amp;Ps.</p>
<p>January construction spending rose 0.4 percent and December spending was revised to down 0.9 pct from down 0.7 percent. NAPM's February index was 53.1, above the 52.9 forecast and the 52.0 reading in January.  </p>
<p>Traders noted a dose of caution in the market ahead of remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday and key employment data on Friday.</p>
<p>Greenspan will deliver the second leg of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on Wednesday, this time to the House Banking Committee.</p>
<p>Some traders said they expected few fireworks from his remarks since his prepared text has already been heard. Others said any mention of the high level of U.S. stocks in the question and answer portion of his testimony could pressure stocks again.  </p>
<p>Greenspan said last Wednesday that he could not rule out a pre-emptive credit tightening, and said caution was due in U.S. stocks as the market's rise might not be sustainable. His comments on the stock market were similar to last December's &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; statement, traders noted.</p>
<p>On Monday's late rise, traders said mild buy-stops were triggered above 795.00.</p>
<p>&quot;But there was nothing that sent people scrambling,&quot; a trader said. He said early resilience was tied to the idea that Friday's sell-off after T-bonds closed was too reactionary and March S&amp;Ps needed to correct upward.  </p>
<p>At the close, March S&amp;P 500s were up 4.85 points at 795.25, KCBT Value Lines rose 4.50 to 709.60, Nikkei rose 25.0 to 18,515.0, Midcap rose 0.40 to 262.20, NYSE Composite was up 2.45 to 417.45, and Nasdaq 100s were up 11.25 at 859.75.
