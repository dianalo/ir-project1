<headline>Northeast US to battle &quot;weak sister&quot; image in 1997.</headline>

<p>This year the Northeastern United States will try to shed its status as a high-cost business region riddled with outmoded, shrinking industries, but economists said it will likely stay an economic laggard.</p>
<p>Rae Rosen, senior economist at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, forecasts 1997 employment growth at a rather anemic one-percent rate for the tri-state region of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are getting reasonably good jobs growth for a mature area of the country, but we're still one of the slowest regions, if not the slowest,&quot; she said. &quot;By far the fastest growth is in the West Coast and Rocky Mountains.&quot;</p>
<p>The prospects for New England, which stretches from Maine down to Connecticut, are brighter than those for the Middle Atlantic states, which encompass New York to Pennsylvania, said Ross DeVol, senior vice president at WEFA Group, an economic consulting firm in Philadelphia.  </p>
<p>He predicted the labor market will grow 1.3 percent in New England this year, more than the foreseen 0.8 percent rise in the Mid-Atlantic states, but less than the expected national average of 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>A recent rash of government layoffs and job-cutting corporate restructurings within many key industries in the Northeast -- including defense, healthcare, insurance and banking -- should gradually end in 1997, lifting the region's prospects, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;When I look out to '97, what I see happening is what I call convergence -- many of the Northeast states' economies start to look more like each other and more like the United States,&quot; said Nicholas Perna, chief economist of Fleet Financial Group, which operates in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Also, investment should be spurred by recent tax cuts in many states within the area and by efforts to reduce the region's relatively high cost of energy and manufacturing wages.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've seen some efforts to reduce taxes in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Longer-term, these cuts will help the region, but in the short-term they will not be a magic fix,&quot; DeVol said.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest hope lies in a growing presence of dynamic industries new to the Northeast which could serve as an engine for growth in 1997 and beyond.</p>
<p>In New York City alone, 8,000 new jobs were created by the burgeoning film industry in 1996, a number the Fed's Rosen called &quot;astounding&quot;.  </p>
<p>The creation of new entertainment/media monoliths such as Walt Disney Co, which purchased Capital Cities/ABC Inc in late 1995 for $19 billion, could draw even more Hollywood dollars to New York, analysts said.</p>
<p>Boston is experiencing explosive growth in the biotechnology industry, while Wall Street has just enjoyed a banner year and market pundits are not calling for massive layoffs when and if the markets' fantastic bull run falters.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street was remarkably restrained this time around on the hiring and we didn't get that type of employment-binge seen in the last boom in the late eighties,&quot; Rosen said.  </p>
<p>The soaring popularity of mutual funds should continue to fuel growth in Massachusetts, the home of such industry powerhouses as Fidelity Investments and Putnam Investments.</p>
<p>Also, Boston's so-called Silicon Valley of the East has recently staged a minor comeback. Internet- and intranet-related firms have revitalized the area which was hard hit in years past after local mainframe computer firms lost a competitive battle with the network personal computer businesses out West, analysts said.  </p>
<p>And cutting-edge industries such as photonics -- the use of light lasers and fiber optics to send and receive data -- are starting to shun the West Coast and call the Northeast home, economists said.</p>
<p>Fleet's Perna pointed to the resurgence of some old corporate standbys, most notably the renewed demand for jet engines such as those made by Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, in Hartford, Connecticut.  </p>
<p>Despite the continued out-migration last year of Northeast residents, the real estate market has shaken off a glut of office space and residential buildings seen in the late 1980's recession. Some areas have even staged a complete turnaround.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing that I think is also interesting about the New England economy is the fact that real estate markets are beginning to get tight again,&quot; said Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Cathy Minehan, speaking to a group of Connecticut business leaders in Hartford on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Perna agreed: &quot;In contrast to the eighties, there is a real estate underhang. We need to put up some office space, apartments, and hotels in parts of the Northeast.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite positive signs, job growth in the Northeast will not catch up to the national average within the next 10 years, DeVol forecast, never mind matching the rocketing 7.0 to 8.0 percent growth seen in Nevada in each of the past five years.</p>
<p>But as Rosen pointed out: &quot;We're not California. We don't get a major influx of people...so the long-run average is good for us.&quot;</p>
