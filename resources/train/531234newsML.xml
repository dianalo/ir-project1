<p>The Czech government approved a plan on Wednesday to issue state bonds to cover the 1.562 billion crown 1996 state budget deficit, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference after a regular cabinet meeting, Kocarnik said the plan would have to be approved by parliament along with the final state account for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We are proposing to cover this deficit by a state bond issue,&quot; Kocarnik said.</p>
<p>He said a decision on the terms of the issue would be left to the parliament.</p>
<p>The minister said that the government also planned to shift 4.384 billion crowns from the state financial reserves to the pension insurance account to put back money collected for pensions but used for other government spending.</p>
<p>He added that municipal budgets closed 1996 with a combined 9.4 billion deficit.</p>
<p>The government planned a balanced 1996 budget but did not fully succeed, despite cuts at the end of the year totalling 9.3 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget was also approved as balanced, with revenues and expenditures at 549.1 billion crowns. But a slowdown in the economy has pushed it into an 8.5 billion deficit in March, prompting the cabinet to cut 25.5 billion in this year's spending.</p>
