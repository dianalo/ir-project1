<p>China's B share indices closed mixed on Thursday with institutions staying on the sidelines, while the A share markets rebounded after losses in the previous session, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's B share index edged down 0.082 points or 0.13 percent to 60.779 points, while the Shenzhen B share index inched up 0.47 points or 0.33 percent to end at 140.74 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai brokers said the B share index closed down on poor sentiment on rumours that concrete measures will soon be announced to force domestic investors out of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Most institutions were seen cutting their positions to avoid risk given the uncertainties,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Real estate developer Shanghai Jinqiao was the biggest loser on concerns about its results, falling $0.020 or 4.16 percent to $0.460.</p>
<p>Newcomer clothing maker Shanghai Kaikai was the most active share rising $0.012 or 3.94 percent to $0.316, mostly on institutional support.</p>
<p>On Shenzhen's B share market, trading was dull with most institutions unwilling to engage in large-scale trading in the absence of market-moving news, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Counters likely to post healthy 1996 results will become relatively strong performers in the run-up to the corporate annual report season,&quot; a Shenzhen-based broker said.</p>
<p>Dadonghai, the best B share performer, rose HK$0.11 or 3.15 percent to HK$3.60 on the day's heaviest trade of 2.90 million shares on institutional buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A share market in both Shanghai and Shenzhen rose on a technical rebound but trading remained sluggish with market sentiment cautious, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A index rose 11.391 points or 1.22 percent to 947.042 points, while the Shenzhen A share index added 3.89 points or 1.18 percent to close at 333.63 points.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, clothing maker Kansai was the star on institutional demand, jumping 10 percent to its limit-up of 17.17 yuan.</p>
<p>In Shenzhen, property concern Shenzhen Fountain was the biggest gainer, surging 0.91 yuan to its 10 percent limit-up of 9.96 yuan on speculative buying, brokers said.</p>
