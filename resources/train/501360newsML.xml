<title>AUSTRALIA: Rangebound Australian stocks creep to higher close.</title>
<headline>Rangebound Australian stocks creep to higher close.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>A rangebound Australian share market captured only light gains by the close on Thursday after mixed finishes in offshore markets dampened the buying enthusiasm seen on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>By 4.25 p.m. (0625 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was up 3.7 points at 2,392.9. June share price index futures were down seven points at 2,386, a 6.9 point discount to the index.</p>
<p>After Wednesday's Wallis-led afternoon sprint higher, banks again were the centre of attention, seeing about 27 percent of the day's turnover by value. The rest of the market was narrowly mixed, spending most of the day trapped in a six point range.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's still a cautious tone,&quot; said a Brisbane-based broker, adding that many investors remained reluctant.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are still sitting on their hands waiting to see if the second half of the (U.S.) correction comes.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said banks had been the ones to watch with plenty of two-way business in the high-profile sector but only modest action elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The banks were an obvious feature in terms of activity but there was not much else to speak,&quot; said a dealer at a Sydney brokerage.  </p>
<p>Like most of the market, the bank sector showed little trend with narrow, mixed finishes the order of the day.</p>
<p>Sector leader National Australia Bank ended barely changed as did Westpac Banking Corporation, both losing a cent to A$16.10 and A$6.66 respectively.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank held modest gains, up six cents at A$13.04, while ANZ Bank lost nine cents to A$$7.80.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a bit of reweighting there as the Wallis inquiry effects continue to be felt,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Among resources, gold/nickel miner WMC was the best performed, continuing its comeback to close up 20 at A$8.02.  </p>
<p>&quot;Western Mining have been very strong over the last couple of days. They were every oversold and now you have seen some bargain hunters out there,&quot; said the Brisbane broker.</p>
<p>Reinsurance group Reinsurance Australia lost ground, dipping 30 cents to end at A$3.80 in moderate activity after the company disappointed with its forecast of only modest premium growth in the 1997 calendar year.</p>
<p>&quot;There had been talk of 20-30 percent growth by some brokers previously,&quot; said a Sydney-based dealer.  </p>
<p>Oil and gas major Santos was active with 9.1 million shares traded, the bulk in three lines totalling 7.7 million through James Capel in what brokers said looked to be normal institutional business.</p>
<p>Santos shares closed four cents lower at A$4.71.</p>
<p>Falls barely shaded rises, while about 30 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Options and futures trade was slower than Wednesday's action with few distinguishing features.</p>
<p>Total options traded 35,730 (50,869)</p>
<p>Turnover in June SPI contracts totalled 6,269 (9,633)  </p>
<p>In other local markets, Australian bonds reversed early weakness to rally strongly on the release of unexpectedly weak March employment data, ending off their highs but still in positive territory. By 5.25 p.m. (0725 GMT), 10 year T-bonds were yielding 7.93 percent from Wednesday's 7.97 percent.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was stripped of 1/2 cent of gains and its recovery put in jeopardy Thursday after dire jobs data resurrected talk of a rate cut.</p>
<p>By 5.25 p.m. (0525 GMT), the local dollar had recoiled to US$0.7795/00 from US$0.7854/59 just before the data hit dealing screens, to be back below Wednesday's late US$0.7810/15.  </p>
