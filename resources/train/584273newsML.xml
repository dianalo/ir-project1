<p>-----------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 14 --------------</p>
<p>Precious metal markets are poised to push higher on Wednesday, with the move likely to be led by the platinum group metals (PGMs), analysts said.</p>
<p>Gold is near $350, but will meet stern resistance there, unless there is momentum generated by the PGMs which remain in tight supply, they said.  </p>
<p>PLATINUM -</p>
<p>Both platinum and palladium continue to be underpinned by tight supply and uncertainty over when Russian availability will improve.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very difficult to judge all these comments from Russia and Japan,&quot; a European analyst said.</p>
<p>Russia's PGM export agency said on Tuesday that it has started talks with clients on 1997 deliveries, and that exports to Japan should start in June.</p>
<p>In the short-term, physical market conditions remain the same.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as there no deliveries, end-users will have to buy off the spot market,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Platinum is currently holding above $390, and could push up to test the week's highs near $399.</p>
<p>At 0827 GMT platinum was quoted at an unchanged $392.50/393.50.</p>
<p>GOLD -</p>
<p>Bullion prices have settled in a new range which broadly runs between $346 and $350, but the upper level will prove to be strong resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;It is fully dependent on what happens in the platinum market...and I think it will be difficult to break that psychological resistance at $350,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Though the technical picture is bullish, it is possible that gold will experience a respite before further advances,&quot; analyst Martin Squires at Rudolf Wolff and Co said.</p>
<p>At 0827 GMT gold was indicated at $349.00/349.40, down around $0.15.</p>
<p>SILVER -</p>
<p>Prices have been helped by the general firmness of the precious metals complex, but the market is now encountering an area of resistance that swirls around $4.90.</p>
<p>At 0827 GMT silver was at $4.86/4.88, down two cents from Tuesday.</p>
