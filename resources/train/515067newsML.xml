<p>Albania said on Tuesday it wanted to meet donors and international investors as soon as possible in a bid to kick-start an economy throttled by months of anarchy.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Arben Malaj said he had had recent meetings with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;We have it confirmed from Italy that it will invite donors, possible donors and others to an international conference,&quot; he said at the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London.</p>
<p>He did not specify the likely timing of the meeting.</p>
<p>An Italian-led multinational force, 6,000 strong, began deploying in Albania on Tuesday to protect aid convoys to the impoverished country.</p>
<p>About 300 people have died in months of violence since the collapse of the get-rich-quick pyramid schemes which wiped out the life savings of many ordinary people.</p>
<p>But Malaj said there were signs that normal civic life was returning to the country.  &quot;Soon Albania will be an attractive country for investors,&quot; Malaj said.</p>
<p>The government would give priority to encouraging foreign investment in the oil and gas sector, chromium mining, tourism, textiles, agriculture and infrastructure, Malaj said.</p>
<p>While a sharp slowdown in the economy as a result of the fighting meant financial compensation to foreign investors in the country was not possible, the government was hoping to pass a law soon which would allow the import of plant and equipment free of duty and tax.</p>
<p>Weeks of looting and violence have led to widespread damage to buildings and businesses in the country and the breakdown of government authority.</p>
<p>Private foreign investment had reached $95 million by the end of last year from $45 million three years earlier, Malaj said, adding that the country had enjoyed good support from international investors since the collapse of communism in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The EBRD, set up in 1991 to assist central and eastern Europe in the transition to market economies, said the projects it had been supporting in Albania before violence erupted had been carefully chosen and had not suffered unduly to date.</p>
<p>&quot;They have not been fundamentally interrupted either physically or in terms of cashflow,&quot; said Olivier Descamps, the Bank's representative for Albania.</p>
<p>He said the international financial community wanted to start negotiations involving the IMF, World Bank, the European Union and Italy and Greece as soon as law and order had been restored in Albania.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is to stabilise the economic situation and gather bilateral grant money for the short-term needs of the Albanian people. They will then need aid and rebuilding money, a Bosnia-type effort,&quot; Descamps said.</p>
<p>Malaj said the EBRD was backing eight projects in Albania, three in the state sector and five in the private sector. It had committed 60 million European currency units ($53 million) of funds to date.</p>
