<p>Quintiles Transnational Corp. said Monday it has a definitive agreement to acquire Innovex Ltd., a private British pharmaceutical firm, in a stock deal valued at about $760 million.</p>
<p>Quintiles said the merger would create the world's largest full-service contract pharmaceutical and healthcare company. The combined companies' whose services would include health care product development and information management, research and development, and consulting.</p>
<p>Innovex is believed to be already the world's largest privately held contract pharmaceutical group, supplementing sales and marketing of drugs for 25 pharmaceutical companies, Quintiles said.</p>
<p>Innovex's revenues rose to $129.1 million in the year ended March 31, from $80.4 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Quintiles will offer 10 million of its shares for all of Innovex's stock in a pooling of interests. Quintiles has about 20 million outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Its stock rose $2.25 to $76 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>Quintiles, based near Research Triangle Park, N.C., said it expected to take a one-time charge for the acquisition but has not determined the amount.</p>
<p>&quot;The combined company of Quintiles and Innovex, if the deal is completed, would be the largest and fastest-growing services company in this arena,&quot; said Quintiles Chairman Dennis Gillings.</p>
<p>&quot;We will provide a unique configuration of services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, comprising a broader spectrum than any other service company.&quot;</p>
<p>The merger is expected to boost earnings by 5 cents to 7 cents per share for 1997, Quintiles spokeswoman Pat Grebe said. In this year's second quarter, Quintiles earned $4.9 million, or 22 cents per share.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close later this year, pending approval by Quintiles shareholders, the company said.</p>
<p>Quintiles said it would retire about $60 million of existing Innovex debt after the deal closes.</p>
<p>Quintiles, which has 41 operating units in 19 countries, recently announced a definitive merger with BRI International, a contract research organisation based in Arlington, Va.</p>
