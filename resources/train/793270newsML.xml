<title>UK: London gold eases as dollar steadies.</title>
<headline>London gold eases as dollar steadies.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-12</dateline>

<p>The gold market hovered below the key $330.00 per ounce mark on Tuesday but dipped lower after New York opened and the dollar consolidated after Friday's sell-off.</p>
<p>Gold's move seemed to confirm dealers' opinion that failure to break into the $330s soon could signal another move to the downside.</p>
<p>Gold prices had rallied last Friday in response to a sharp decline in U.S. stock and bond markets.</p>
<p>But Wall Street's better performance on Monday diminished the chances that gold could summon up enough support to push higher for now, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $326.20 per ounce down from $327.60 at the Tuesday morning fix and $327.00 on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The New York Comex December gold futures contract was down $2.50 at $330.00 as investors there were lured into taking advantage of the reviving dollar and stock markets.</p>
<p>U.S. economic data due later this week could be a key for the gold price.</p>
<p>&quot;Any signs that inflation is picking up will give the market further support...In any case there is no point getting too positive unless there is a convincing break of resistance at $330,&quot; brokers GNI said in a report.</p>
<p>Lease rates were a few points higher at 1.93 percent for a month indicating the likely re-opening of short positions and borrowing for producer forward selling, dealers said.</p>
<p>Average daily turnover volumes released today by the London Bullion Market Association for July averaged 37 million ounces daily through the LBMA's clearing members, the highest figure since February.</p>
<p>Although the average price was significantly lower than in June at 324.10 per ounce against June's $340.76, the value of the transactions was $12 billion daily, the highest since march.</p>
<p>Silver prices turned lower with gold to $4.41/$4.43, a cent down on Monday's close and platinum and palladium were also weaker following the end of a dispute at South Africa's Implala refinery.</p>
<p>Platinum was indicated at $433.00/$437.00, down $11.00 and palladium was quoted at $226.50/$229.50, down $5.10.</p>
