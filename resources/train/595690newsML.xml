<p>An Iraqi opposition group said on Monday more than 100 people had died in fighting at the weekend between rival Kurdish groups from Turkey and Iraq in a northern Iraqi city.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Iraqi National Congress told Reuters that Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), now cooperating with the Turkish army in nearby mountains, had overrun offices of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the city of Arbil.  </p>
<p>&quot;The battles in Arbil resulted in 53 KDP (fighters) killed,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Among the PKK and allied parties, there was a total of 58 dead, 28 of whom were killed after capture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Five women were captured, raped and then publicly executed by the KDP in full view of the citizens,&quot; said the spokesman, citing satellite telephone communications inside Iraq.</p>
<p>The KDP, led by Massoud Barzani, used 106-mm anti-tank guns on buildings occupied by the PKK, he said. There was no independent confirmation of the incident.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Kurdish faction has joined forces with Turkish troops on a large offensive against the separatist PKK in the mountains of northern Iraq in the last week.</p>
