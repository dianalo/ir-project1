<p>Tens of thousands of leather-clad motorcyclists roared into this small California farming town on Friday to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a rowdy biker rally that inspired the Marlon Brando movie &quot;The Wild One.&quot;</p>
<p>Organisers expected between 50,000 and 100,000 bikers and spectators to converge on Hollister over the three-day Fourth of July holiday weekend for events commemorating the infamous 1947 &quot;Invasion of Hollister.&quot;</p>
<p>Gleaming Harley-Davidsons lined the main street of Hollister, 100 miles (160 kms) south of San Francisco. Convoys of bikes kept arriving from all over California and other states, creating a deafening din.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, about 4,000 motorcyclists descended on the small town, including members of the &quot;Boozefighters&quot; club from Los Angeles, for an Independence Day rally. As the beer flowed, bikers raced around the town, fights broke out and dozens were arrested.</p>
<p>The event, magnified by the media, inspired the 1954 movie &quot;The Wild One,&quot; in which rival motorcycle gangs take over a small town, and helped create an image of bikers as outlaws.</p>
<p>&quot;It's about time California put something on like this,&quot; said Barry Thys, 48, who had taken a week to ride to the rally on his 1942 Harley-Davidson from Yakima, Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's fantastic,&quot; Ray Hallstein, a 67-year-old retired pilot, said after arriving on his motorcycle from Saratoga, 40 miles (70 kms) away. &quot;I came to see the show, see the people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There was little sign of the &quot;wild one&quot; spirit as bikers strolled around Hollister, a town of 25,000 people. They bought t-shirts and food from booths lining the main street and admired the shining motorcycles, mainly Harley-Davidsons with a sprinkling of Kawasakis and BMWs.</p>
<p>Many of today's motorcycle enthusiasts are professionals who ride their expensive Harley-Davidsons as a hobby.</p>
<p>But police were taking no chances, calling in reinforcements from surrounding counties and the California Highway Patrol to supplement the 23 officers who normally patrol the quiet town.</p>
<p>Hollister police spokesman Noel Belton said police had so far made two arrests for prostitution and a few for drunken driving. &quot;We're expecting no trouble this weekend. It's just like any other Fourth of July celebration,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One person missing from the celebration was &quot;Wino Willie&quot; Forkner, a founder of the Boozefighters Motorcycle Club who was at the 1947 Hollister rally.</p>
<p>Forkner, nicknamed the &quot;original wild one,&quot; died in a California hospital last month at the age of 76, not living long enough to fulfil his dream of returning to Hollister for the 50th anniversary celebration.</p>
<p>Catherine Dabo, 77, who ran a Hollister hotel in 1947, said the news media exaggerated the rowdiness of that year's rally. She said she did not know there was trouble until she read about it later in a newspaper.</p>
<p>Organisers have planned four events for the visitors over the holiday weekend in the Hollister area, with rock music, races and fireworks. One event has camping for 40,000 people while another, dubbed &quot;Return of the Wild Ones,&quot; features motorcycle vendors and a concert.</p>
<p>While some of the town's businesses closed, perhaps fearing the biker invasion, other merchants greeted the visitors with open arms, seeing a chance to profit. Many businesses displayed signs saying &quot;Bikers welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a huge opportunity for Hollister. There's lots of opportunity for us to benefit economically,&quot; Brenda Weatherly, president of the San Benito County Chamber of Commerce, said.</p>
<p>&quot;They could be your dentist, they could be a lawyer, they could be part of the Hell's Angels. But they're just people and they're here having a good time and we hope to benefit from that,&quot; she said of the bikers.</p>
