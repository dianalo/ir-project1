<p>Former German international Bernd Schuster began a career as a coach on Wednesday when he took charge of second division side Fortuna Cologne.</p>
<p>The former Barcelona midfielder, who has been involved in controversy at almost all his previous clubs, left Mexican side UNAM in April and has been back in Germany studying for a coaching qualification.</p>
<p>Schuster, who won 21 caps for West Germany before quitting the national side over a dispute with his team-mates, said Fortuna had approached him at the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm pretty surprised but I'm also very pleased,&quot; said Schuster, who used to play for Fortuna's big city rivals Cologne, told Wednesday's edition of the Bild newspaper.</p>
<p>Schuster, nicknamed the &quot;blond angel&quot; by the German press, played for Atletico and Real Madrid as well as Barcelona during his spell in Spain.</p>
<p>He last played in Germany for Bayer Leverkusen but left under a cloud last year, gaining a huge compensation payout from the club which had banned him from playing during a legal dispute between him and senior officials.</p>
