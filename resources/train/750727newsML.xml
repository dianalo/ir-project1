<headline>Germany's Waigel mulls cut in EU contributions.</headline>

<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel is considering a plan under which Germany's payments to the European Union could be capped well below current levels, a finance ministry spokeswoman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the plan was one of a number of proposals for a fairer method of financing the EU being developed by the ministry.</p>
<p>The Die Zeit newspaper said Waigel planned to present the plan to the EU this autumn. It would cut nearly a third off Germany's current 22 billion mark annual contribution from the year 2000, the weekly paper said.</p>
<p>Under the plan, a country would get back two-thirds of all contributions it made that exceeded 0.3 percent of its gross national product.</p>
<p>With Germany's payments at around 0.6 percent of its GNP, this would mean a repayment of seven billion marks, Die Zeit said in a summary of an article to be published on Thursday.</p>
<p>The finance ministry spokeswoman said the details contained in the article summary were accurate but that concrete figures had not been settled in the proposal.</p>
<p>Both government and opposition politicians have complained recently that Germany's payments to the EU represent well over half all net contributions to the 15-nation bloc and are out of proportion with the size of its economy.</p>
<p>The German economy represents about a quarter of the EU's total gross domestic product.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel called at the weekend for a change the way member states' EU payments were calculated.</p>
<p>But Kinkel said Germany would always pay more than other members as it was the main beneficiary of the EU's single market -- the destination for 75 percent of German exports.</p>
