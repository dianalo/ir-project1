<p>Kevin Keegan dedicated Newcastle's 5-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday to the fans.</p>
<p>As Newcastle shot to the top of the premier league, the manager said: &quot;I reminded the players before today's game that the fans had spent hard-earned cash to get down to Wembley for the Charity Shield and that although we got beaten 4-0 they still clapped us off at the end.</p>
<p>&quot;Today they came close to producing a miracle because Manchester United will not get beaten 5-0 again in a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>But Keegan added: &quot;The league won't give us any more than three points and we've got to reproduce that in the weeks that follow.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to learn from last year because if we don't then last year will have been wasted.&quot;</p>
<p>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said philosophically: &quot;It's just another day in the history of Manchester United...it was just one of those unfortunate games.&quot; He added: &quot;We played some good football and took the game to them. In the second half we were punished for every mistake we made. But everyone knows how our players will respond to a result like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Newcastle chairman Sir John Hall, asked if the result made up for the disappointment of the Charity Shield, quipped: &quot;The Charity Shield. What's that?&quot;</p>
