<p>Top Russian lawmakers who have rejected and delayed passage of the 1997 draft budget said they would pass it on Sunday if the government met certain criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the fight will be hot, but probably the decision will be positive,&quot; the Communist speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament, Gennady Seleznyov said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Communists, the dominant party in the Duma, called for the rejection of the budget during the previous debate on December 6, when voting on the first reading was postponed until Sunday.</p>
<p>But deputy leader Valentin Kuptsov said after a party conference on Saturday the Communist leadership had agreed to pass the budget if the government met 11 conditions, including paying overdue pensions and introducing an investment fund.</p>
<p>He said they would back the bill &quot;if a series of conditions are fulfilled&quot;, Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;(Though) if our demands are not met, we not only will not vote for the budget, but we could call for a vote of confidence in the government,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Communist-allied Agrarian party and ultra-nationalist LDPR party have said they support the bill but Interfax quoted Grigory Yavlinsky, head of liberal opposition Yabloko party as saying his party would vote against it.</p>
<p>This could make it the only major party to oppose the budget, and Yabloko member Mikhail Zadornov, head of the budget committee, predicted on Tuesday it would pass.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who celebrated four years at his post on Saturday, has previously offered to make the concession Communists called for on Saturday.</p>
<p>In his December 6 speech to the Duma before it postponed the vote, he unexpectedly called for the creation of an off-budget investment fund, a &quot;budget of growth&quot; to lure foreign funds, partly thanks to government guarantees of commercial loans.</p>
<p>The Duma has repeatedly called for increased government investment in industry in order to revive growth.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Chernomyrdin promised to pay wage arrears of some 7.9 trillion roubles this month.</p>
<p>&quot;In all main spheres, except the army, 100 percent of debts will be repaid in December. This way we will make our debts disappear and will not allow new indebtedness to form and grow,&quot; he said, without specifying funding sources.</p>
<p>But Chernomyrdin also told the Duma Russia would not print new money to cover a wider budget deficit wider than 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, as called for by some communists.</p>
<p>If deputies fail to approve a budget by year-end, Russia will have to use interim budgets or re-use the 1996 plan.</p>
<p>But fears that failure to pass the budget on Sunday, a working day in Russia, could further jeopardise monthly payouts of a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan, were eased when the IMF approved disbursement of a delayed tranche.</p>
<p>It gave the go-ahead on Friday for the release of roughly $336 million, citing &quot;improved revenue performance&quot;. It had previously criticised Russia's tax collection record.</p>
<p>The Russian government has championed a tight monetary policy which has led to steep falls in inflation, from close to 20 percent in January 1995 to 1.9 percent in November.</p>
<p>But the squeeze has also contributed to misery for millions of workers, who have not been paid for months by cash-strapped firms. Tax revenue, in turn, is well below target.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin told the Duma that if budget targets were met and 1997 inflation did not exceed 11-12 percent, the economy could grow by two percent. GDP fell six percent in real terms in the first 11 months of this year from January-November 1995.</p>
<p>The target deficit had been widened from the government's initial proposal of 3.3 percent and Chernomyrdin said a further widening of the gap could be damaging.</p>
<p>&quot;We must not allow this to happen. If we do, all our sufferings and pains will be in vain,&quot; he said.</p>
