<p>Indian call money was quoted in the 0.5-0.75 percent range at close of trade on Wednesday, little changed from the day's opening quotes, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said call rates remained easy on good liquidity and poor demand for funds.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, everyone seems to have funds in plenty,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;There are few borrowers.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected call money rates to remain easy for the rest of the week but they could harden slightly next week as companies made advance tax payments.</p>
<p>The last date for such payments is December 15 and some dealers said the outflow of funds on this account could cause some tightening. But other dealers differed.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporate earnings are down in the first half of the year,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;As such their tax liabilities may not be high.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of governemnt securities were steady in moderate trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a number of sellers today but not many buyers,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;There was major movement in prices.&quot;</p>
<p>The 13.85 percent 2001 government of India stock traded on Wednesday at a yield of 13.44 percent against its last trade of 13.46 percent, dealers said. The 13.55 percent 2001 stock was traded at 13.48 percent against 13.51, they said.</p>
