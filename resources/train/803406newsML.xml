<p>Wall Street Stocks were expected to open mixed Friday, capping a week of strong volatility amid a slew of benign key inflation data.</p>
<p>Volume on the opening was expected to be brisk due to block trades from Thursday's closing futures, analysts said. Volume on the close was also set to be strong.</p>
<p>&quot;In between we are just looking at a Friday in August and I see a bit of a void,&quot; said analyst Larry Wachtel of Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 futures were flat at 928.05 points. On Thursday U.S. stocks closed with slender gains after a second straight session saw a sharp early rally fizzle in the face of nervous selling pressure.</p>
<p>The Dow Industrials closed Thursday up 13.71 points at 7,942.03. In the broader market the advancing issues led declines 1,516 to 1,258 on heavy volume of 530 million shares.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Dow still needed to consolidate after its strong run up in recent weeks despite the current good outlook for inflation.</p>
<p>The long bond was off 5/32 to yield 6.56 percent.</p>
