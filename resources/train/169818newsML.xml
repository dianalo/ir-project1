<p>President Bill Clinton's decision to fight the Republicans head on in Florida paid off when he became the first Democrat for 20 years to win the state.</p>
<p>Two factors with a touch of irony helped him carry the day, analysts said.</p>
<p>Women trying to balance jobs and home duties voted for a man dogged by allegations of marital infidelity.</p>
<p>And old folk who have flocked to Florida for a retirement in the sun rejected the 73-year-old Republican challenger Bob Dole in favour of the younger Clinton.</p>
<p>Support from working-class families and minorities was also crucial. Clinton took 47 percent of the vote against Dole's 43 percent, the first Democrat victor since Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p>
<p>Clinton had worked hard on Florida voters, spending $8 million from his war chest and making many campaign forays here.</p>
<p>He plunged into Miami's Little Havana, bastion of the conservative Cuban American community, and promised environmentalists he would help them save the Everglades.</p>
<p>&quot;Dole had a problem with the ladies,&quot; Bob Joffe, an analyst at Mason Dixon Political Media Research, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Women are in the work force and have responsibilities at home. They don't have a hell of a lot of patience with a candidate who they suspect doesn't understand what they are going through,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The other important voting block was working-class families, Joffe said -- &quot;alienated, normally apathetic but concerned about the economy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This time they went for Clinton or (Ross) Perot.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton had successfully convinced older voters that a Republican adminstration would threaten their Medicare health benefits, drawing accusations from the Dole camp that he was using scare tactics.</p>
<p>Dole also campaigned relentlessly in the state, promising to slash taxes and assailing perceived flaws in Clinton's character. But it fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Minorities and immigrants bolstered Clinton's support. He was the overwhelming choice of blacks, with nine out of 10 voting for him.</p>
<p>&quot;He helped my country,&quot; said Velius Prince, 47, of Miami Shores, a naturalised citizen from Haiti. &quot;Clinton's not just president of the United States. He's the president for all over.&quot;</p>
<p>Although Dole won among Cuban American voters with 44 percent, Clinton won a 43 percent wedge in a community that by tradition is staunchly right-wing.</p>
<p>The 13 percent gain reflected that a younger generation of Cuban Americans is less obsessed with how a U.S. government deals with Cuban President Fidel Castro, while their parents were impressed by a tougher line Clinton has taken on their nemesis.</p>
<p>Gov. Lawton Chiles said the battle for Florida had been so crucial that Clinton reckoned if he won here the election was over.</p>
<p>Chiles said that when he called the president to say he had won, &quot;he said I could turn out the lights&quot;.</p>
<p>But Joffe said the vote was as much against Dole as a sign of Clinton's popularity. The Miami Herald said many south Floridians who voted for Clinton did so grudgingly.</p>
<p>&quot;His convictions seemed too elastic, his platitudes (&quot;a bridge to the future&quot;) too contrived and the character-related charges leveled against him too plausible,&quot; it said.</p>
