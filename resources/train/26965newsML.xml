<p>Rebels have attacked in Burundi's northwest Kayanza province and nearly a dozen government buildings were looted and burned, state-run radio said on Monday.</p>
<p>It said Hutu rebels attacked Gatara village five km (three miles) south of Kayanza town on Saturday, a day before Burundi's Hutu prime minister Pascal Firmin Ndimira visited the region.</p>
<p>&quot;There was heavy fighting in Gatara on Saturday morning. Nearly a dozen administrative buildings were burned, pillaged and destroyed,&quot; the radio said. It gave no casualty figures.</p>
<p>It said in the northern province of Kirundo people had accepted changes resulting from the July 25 coup by the Burundi military but in Kayanza the Hutu rebels remained very active. It gave no more details.</p>
<p>State-run radio has been heavily censored since the coup and has had few reports of violence, according to local journalists.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in the last three years in Burundi in massacres and a civil war between the army and rebels that have raised fears of bloodletting on a scale similar to Rwanda's genocide in 1994 when one million died.</p>
<p>Burundi's Tutsi military ruler Pierre Buyoya dismissed on Saturday a U.N. Security Council threat of an arms embargo in 60 days and ruled out talks with Hutu rebels unless they laid down their arms.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in favour of negotiations, but you can't negotiate without conditions. We can't negotiate with people we are fighting. It simply isn't possible,&quot; he told business leaders.</p>
<p>On a resolution by the U.N. Security Council on Friday to press for talks within 60 days, he said: &quot;Peace isn't decided in the Security Council...it is Burundians who must demand and live to make peace.&quot;</p>
<p>Neighbouring states have cut air and road links with Burundi since July 31 to try to pressure the Tutsi-dominated army to return the country to constitutional rule and agree to talks with rebels.</p>
<p>Rebel forces last week increased the isolation of Bujumbura, a Tutsi stronghold, by twice cutting power lines to the city, forcing residents to use dwindling fuel stocks or generators.</p>
<p>They have also cut the main road north from Bujumbura to the Rwandan border with a series of ambushes and by digging it up to make it impassable for all vehicles for most of the weekend.</p>
<p>Hutu rebels stepped up attacks in Kayanza region last week, operating from their stronghold in nearby Kibira forest, which analysts say is virtually off limits to the Burundi's army.</p>
<p>Two truck drivers were last week burned alive in their vehicle in one of a series of ambushes by Hutu rebels on the country's main national route one, which runs through Kayanza.</p>
