<title>GERMANY: Bonn brands Scientology advertisement &quot;absurd&quot;.</title>

<p>Germany said on Friday the Church of Scientology was insulting millions of Jewish victims of the Holocaust by levelling &quot;totally absurd&quot; charges that Bonn uses Nazi tactics against its followers.</p>
<p>But officials said Bonn would not dignify an anti-German Scientology campaign, which kicked off with a scathing full-page advertisement in the New York Times on Thursday, by launching a formal complaint against it.</p>
<p>The advertisement, headlined &quot;Practising Religious Intolerance&quot; and &quot;Germany Then and Now&quot;, bore the eagle and swastika insignia of Hitler's Third Reich and compared contemporary German attitudes towards the religious organisation with the Nazi persecution of the Jews.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe Scientology's accusations are totally absurd,&quot; German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;By comparing its treatment in Germany with Nazi crimes against the Jews, Scientology is falsifying history. What is worse, it's also insulting the feelings of the victims of the Nazi regime and their relatives.&quot;</p>
<p>In Germany, Scientology is not classed as a church and many politicians want it placed under surveillance after allegatiions that it exploits the weak.</p>
<p>The advertisement described Germany as the only country systematically discriminating against Scientologists.</p>
<p>&quot;You may wonder why German officials discriminate against Scientologists,&quot; it said. &quot;There is no legitimate reason but then there was none that justified the persecution of the Jewish people either.&quot;</p>
<p>Erdmann said the German government would not lodge a formal complaint about the advertisement or demand a right to reply as it believed this could add credibility to the accusations.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not contribute to this campaign by taking it seriously,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Scientology was founded in 1954 by the American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Would-be members take personality tests and are then offered courses and literature to help them realise what the church sees as their full potential.</p>
<p>Some German officials have demanded Scientology be banned or at least be observed by Bonn's anti-extremist agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constition.</p>
<p>The youth wing of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) called earlier this year for a boycott of the Hollywood blockbuster &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; because it stars Tom Cruise -- one of several high-profile Scientologists.</p>
<p>Fellow film stars Nicole Kidman, who is also Cruise's wife, and John Travolta are also members of the church.</p>
<p>The controversial advertisement also drew fire on Thursday from the U.S. State Department, which has sometimes backed Scientology's grievances against German authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an outrageous charge against the German government by an American group. It bears no resemblance to the facts of what's going on there,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. &quot;The language used is needlessly provocative.&quot;</p>
