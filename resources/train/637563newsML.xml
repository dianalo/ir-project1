<p>Iraq and China Wednesday signed a $1.2 billion contract to develop the vast Ahdab oilfield in southern Iraq, Chinese and Iraqi officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Just now we signed al-Ahdab oilfield,&quot; Zhou Yong-Kang, chairman of the Chinese National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), told reporters. &quot;Indeed it is a pleasant occasion to sign the important al-Ahdab oil contract between two friendly countries Iraq's Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said.</p>
<p>The field, which contains an estimated 1 billion barrels of oil, is near Kut, 110 miles south of Baghdad.</p>
<p>Rasheed said the cost of the project, which would be implemented over 22 years, was estimated at $660 million while operation costs were put around $600 million. He said the deal would bring Iraq a total of $10 billion in revenues.</p>
<p>Rasheed said the field would produce 90,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p>He said the Iraqi government and the National Assembly (parliament) had ratified the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore it is ready for implementation as from tomorrow,&quot; he added. U.N. trade sanctions imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait place a blanket ban on export investment in the country, but the U.N. has allowed Iraq to pump $2 billion worth of oil over six months to pay for humanitarian purchases.</p>
<p>Zhou said China would start work on aspects that did not violate the United Nations sanctions. &quot;Of course, some of the works would be restricted...We would begin with preparatory and drilling works,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked how China would finance the project, Zhou said: &quot;It would be through two channels...the CNPC itself and international financial organisations and banks.&quot;</p>
<p>China is also interested in the development of the prized Halfaya field in the south.</p>
<p>&quot;We have serious discussions on the Halfaya field. We will continue discussions on this oilfield until its fruitful conclusion, hopefully in the near future,&quot; Rasheed said.</p>
<p>Halfaya was discovered 20 years ago and is believed to hold commercial reserves of about 5 billion barrels. Iraq believes the field could produce some 250,000 barrels a day at full capacity.</p>
<p>Iraq and Russia in March signed a $3.5 billion contract to develop up to 8 billion barrels of reserves in southern Iraq's Qurna oilfield, 300 miles south of Baghdad. The deal will be implemented over 23 years.</p>
