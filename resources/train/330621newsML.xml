<title>USA: CSCE cocoa surges late on spec, trade buying.</title>
<headline>CSCE cocoa surges late on spec, trade buying.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE cocoa prices rocketed higher late in the session, surging more than $50 per tonne amid heavy speculative and industry buying, market sources said.</p>
<p>Nearby March futures leapt to a peak of $1,313, up $53 from the previous close, as traders scrambled to cover short positions racked up during the last week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mostly short-covering,&quot; said one. &quot;Stops were hit at $1,290 (basis March) and again above $1,310.&quot;  </p>
<p>Today's rally comes after a week in which cocoa futures lost more than five percent of their value, sliding to new life-of-contract lows in successive sessions.</p>
<p>Dealers said the run-up was mainly a correction from a sharply oversold condition, but they noted some new buying once key resistance levels were cleared.</p>
<p>At 1346 EST, March cocoa was $47 higher, at $1,307, just off its earlier top of $1,313. Second-position May was also up $47, to $1,342.</p>
