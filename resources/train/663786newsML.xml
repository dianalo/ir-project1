<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Italian bonds/futures closing report.</headline>

<p>Italian debt markets ended buoyantly but below a record peak set by the front month futures contract, with positive sentiment boosted by an EU deal on fiscal discipline and jobs.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers agreed a resolution on employment, dousing a row over a stability pact on budget deficit levels and rescuing plans to form the single European currency. The agreement, which by this morning had been expected by the market, served to soothe recent worries over the EMU process.</p>
<p>The Btp September future on LIFFE flew to a fresh record high of 132.39 on expectations of the deal.  </p>
<p>By late trade however it was standing 43 basis points up on the day at 132.22.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is long so it's difficult to find new buyers around these levels,&quot; a London based broker said.</p>
<p>Once the accord was announced the future settled down to range trade quietly between 131.95 and 132.25. Further resistance was pencilled in at 132.50 and then 132.78.</p>
<p>The February 2007 bond was 37 basis points up at 98.64 with the yield 7.05 percent and the spread over Bunds 138 basis points. Brokers said sentiment was positive but the risk now lay with Bunds. Some saw the spread closing in 90 basis points.  </p>
<p>&quot;But we need to see if the spread closes in because Bunds fall or because Btps rise,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The market would now watch what else came out of the EU meeting in Amsterdam, traders said, adding that there might be some profit taking in the meantime.</p>
<p>At home, the Treasury's auction of 1.5 trillion lire of 10-year Btps attracted demand for more than twice the amount of paper on offer and yields fell.</p>
