<p>A bipartisan coalition of senators Thursday unveiled a bill to preserve aid to hundreds of thousands of elderly and disabled legal immigrants who will lose benefits this summer under a controversial welfare law.</p>
<p>The legislation sponsored by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, Rhode Island Republican John Chafee and others would guarantee that legal immigrants who were receiving Food Stamp and disability aid when the welfare law was signed last year will continue to get federal checks.</p>
<p>Under the law, legal immigrants now receiving disability and nutrition aid must be terminated by Aug. 22. Those who were not on the rolls before August, when the law took effect, are already ineligible for most federal benefit programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;What concerns me are the frail elderly and disabled people who are going to be homeless come Aug. 22, and it will happen,&quot; Feinstein told reporters.</p>
<p>New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato compared the welfare cutoff to &quot;Oliver Twist times.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 40 percent of total savings in the welfare law will come from denying benefits to legal aliens. As the deadline for ending aid to legal immigrants approaches, pressure is building for Congress to act.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Republicans recognised there were &quot;some immediate problems&quot; under the welfare law but did not want a blanket change. He added it was &quot;not that hard to become a U.S. citizen&quot; and therefore become eligible for aid.</p>
<p>President Clinton's balanced budget plan would restore about $15 billion to immigrants. It guarantees aid to immigrants disabled after entering the United States but continues Food Stamps only through Sept. 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, House and Senate Republicans were struggling to come up with a far smaller welfare fix than the lawmakers proposed Thursday, but they have run into trouble.</p>
<p>House Republicans are considering a plan to cut other programmes for the poor or unemployed to come up with about $2 billion for a two-year block grant states could use to help elderly and disabled immigrants.</p>
<p>Republicans have mulled a host of ways to pay for any new aid, including trimming a tax credit for the working poor. They are also looking at possible money-saving reforms in other programmes such as unemployment insurance. Admitting they have had a tough time finding savings, some say the aid package could ultimately be less than $2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The more you work this thing the more problems you find in terms of funding. These are tight times,&quot; Florida Republican Representative Clay Shaw said. &quot;It's dwindling.&quot;</p>
