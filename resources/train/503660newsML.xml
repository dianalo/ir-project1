<title>LEBANON: Lebanese pound eases against dollar.</title>
<headline>Lebanese pound eases against dollar.</headline>

<p>The Lebanese pound fell back against the dollar in interbank trade in the week ended on Friday amid heavy demand for U.S. currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said commercial banks traded the pound at 1548.5 per dollar -- six pounds stronger than the previous week's interbank rate of 1,542.5 and 2.5 pounds above Thursday's 1,546.</p>
<p>The Bank of Lebanon lowered its bid-offer intervention band during the week to 1,540-1549.5 pounds per dollar from 1,540.5-1,550 last week.</p>
<p>Dealers said a large dollar order by one commercial bank created pressure at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for dollars continued as a result of political uncertainty arising from the issue of municipal elections,&quot; Nabil Abou Jaoude, Treasury and Forex manager for Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government's withdrawal of the elections bill last week angered President Elias Hrawi, Christian and leftist opposition and caused concern that the government might delay the elections which are due in June.</p>
<p>&quot;Another factor is the restrictions imposed by the central bank on short term treasury bills which led non-resident investors to shift to U.S. currency,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pressure on the market slowed down trading operations on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite many questions asked on the market, trade was thin today. It seems everyone was in a wait-and-see state after the bid-offer margin was close to one pound,&quot; Abou Jaoude said.</p>
<p>All demand for dollars was met by commercial banks without central bank intervention, Shadi Hanna Treasurer for Bank Byblos told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was very normal and the central bank is in full control. The rise of the U.S. dollar is a technical matter,&quot; Hanna said.</p>
