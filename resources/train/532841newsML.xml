<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday Britain needed an early tightening in monetary policy and some fiscal tightening to help restrain demand.</p>
<p>In its World Economic Outlook, released in Washington, it said Britain's solid upswing, now in its fifth year, was expected to continue in 1997 on the strength of consumption and a projected pickup in business investment.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent appreciation of sterling is helping to dampen inflationary pressures and seems to pose no immediate threat to the expansion, but the forces supporting growth may be tilting too much towards domestic demand,&quot; the IMF said.</p>
<p>&quot;Wage increases have picked up as unemployment has continued to fall and there is a risk that inflation will again exceed the authorities' target (of 2-1/2 percent or below) in 1998 and beyond unless further action is taken to rein in demand.</p>
<p>&quot;This would need to be achieved in the first instance through an early tightening of monetary policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The IMF said that while the fiscal deficit had been reduced substantially in recent years, last November's budget had tightened the fiscal stance only slightly in the near term.</p>
<p>&quot;More fiscal action is needed to help restrain demand and alleviate the burden on monetary policy,&quot; it added.</p>
