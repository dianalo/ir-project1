<title>PAKISTAN: Karachi building collapse death toll rises to five.</title>
<headline>Karachi building collapse death toll rises to five.</headline>
<dateline>KARACHI, Pakistan 1997-07-03</dateline>

<p>Rescuers said on Thursday they could see three crushed bodies in the debris of a collapsed building in this city in southern Pakistan, raising the casualty toll to five dead and nine injured.</p>
<p>&quot;There could be more bodies in the rubble as a lot of debris still has to be cleared,&quot; said a senior government official after a night-long rescue operation in Karachi North.</p>
<p>&quot;We have started using bulldozers after checks that there are no more people trapped alive inside,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rescue workers initially said up to 45 labourers could have been inside the Faiza Heights apartment building when it fell to the ground early on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Officials have blamed the collapse of the almost-completed four-storey block on poor building materials.</p>
<p>Karachi's deputy inspector general of police, Mohammad Iqbal, said the project supervisor had been arrested and police were searching for the builders and the architect. &quot;It was not negligence, they knew what they were doing,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Karachi commissioner, the city's top administrator, Mir Hussain Ali, told Reuters television a murder case had been registered against the builders and engineers involved and this would act as a deterrent to other contractors in Karachi.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident took place because of defective construction and structural failure,&quot; he said. &quot;Probably the builders were not using the proper ingredients for construction.&quot;</p>
