<headline>Dow ends above 6200 for first time as bonds rally.</headline>

<p>The Dow industrials see-sawed to their first close above 6200 just one day after ending above 6100 for the first time, bolstered by an afternoon bond market rally and lingering post-election enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The Dow set its second consecutive record closing high, up 28 to about 6206 after climbing 96.53 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds came back from the death of the dollar and apparently there was a decent 30-year bond auction,&quot; said Dean Witter chief investment strategist Peter Canelo. &quot;We may get to 6500 before year end or sometime in the first quarter.&quot;  </p>
<p>Winners beat losers 13-10 on very heavy NYSE volume of about 501 million shares. The S&amp;P 500 set its third straight all-time high finish, up three to about 728. Likewise, the NYSE Composite rose one to about 385.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still recognizing all the good things in the election. We have a much more conservative Senate, and not just because of the two new GOP senators. The market also sees (Senate Majority leader) Trent Lott as being more effective negotiating with the president (than former Senate Majority leader Bob Dole). There's better hopes of deficit reduction,&quot; Canelo said.  </p>
<p>He added that &quot;All the propositions and referendums mostly went pro-business like 211.&quot; California's Proposition 211 would have made it easier for investors to sue companies whose results failed to meet forecasts. Technology companies with volatile stocks have been a favorite target for class-action lawsuits.</p>
<p>The tech-studded Nasdaq Composite surged nine to about 1254, nearing October 15's record high finish of 1258.10.</p>
<p>Bellwether Intel rose 3-1/4 to 122-1/8. With 211's defeat, Intel, after Wednesday's close, made an earnings forecast and projected sharply higher fourth-quarter revenues and gross profit margins due to strong demand for personal computer chips.  </p>
<p>Stocks fell prey to early profit-taking, a sharply lower U.S. dollar and soft bonds. In late New York trading, the dollar was at 111.90 yen, down from 113.95 yen Wednesday.</p>
<p>The dollar tumbled after Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of Japan's Ministry of Finance's International Finance Bureau, said the dollar's rally from 1995 lows was nearly over.</p>
<p>Sakakibara is widely considered the architect of the yen's decline since 1995 and the comments sparked market speculation that the Group of Three nations had waited until after the U.S. elections to admit their consensus on a strong dollar was breaking down.  </p>
<p>But bonds turned around and rallied as news of a decent bond auction spurred short-covering. The long bond rallied 1-4/32 to yield 6.53 percent, a fresh eight-month low. &quot;With yields this low, it's absolutely not competitive. Stocks are by far the better bet,&quot; Canelo said.</p>
<p>Raising hopes for a good Christmas selling season was news that U.S. September consumer installment credit fell $2.6 billion at a 2.7 percent annual rate, the first decline in more than three years. &quot;The optimism expressed by most investors suggest a merry Christmas,&quot; said Charlie Crane, director of research at Spears Benzak Salomon and Farrell.  </p>
<p>Technology stocks helped lead the market higher. IBM rose 1/2 to 133-3/4 and Cisco Systems added 3-1/4 to 64-1/2.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard rose 2-3/4 to 48-1/8. SoundView Financial raised fiscal 1997 earnings estimates.</p>
<p>Gateway 2000 rose four to 53. Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform.</p>
<p>Chips &amp; Technologies surged 3-7/8 to 23-5/8. The company said it was comfortable with Street fiscal 1997 forecasts and said its stock might be moving in sympathy with Intel's rise.</p>
<p>Among other issues, Lowe's Cos lost four to 39-1/2. It reported a 10 percent rise in October same-store sales.  </p>
<p>It also forecast that third-quarter earnings would top expectations but warned that fourth-quarter earnings would fall shy of Street estimates.</p>
<p>Intimate Brands lost 3-1/2 to 16-1/2 after making a more conservative projection on fourth-quarter and 1997 results.</p>
<p>Best Buy lost 3-5/8 to 12-5/8 after reporting a drop in monthly same-store sales and projecting third-quarter earnings that would be below a year ago's.</p>
<p>Republic Industries rose 2-7/8 to 33-5/8 after agreeing to acquire Alamo Rent-A-Car in a deal valued at $625 million.</p>
<p>Fila Holdings surged 7-1/4 to 82-7/8 in U.S. trading.  </p>
<p>Fila reported sharply higher quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>United Healthcare rose 4-1/4 to 44-1/4 on perceptions that the largest U.S. managed care firm is on the mend. As expected, it reported weaker third-quarter profits but sequential improvement over the second quarter, strong enrollment growth and an improved 1997 outlook.</p>
<p>Donnkenny slumped 3-5/8 to 8-7/8 after news its auditors resigned. Bear Stearns downgraded the stock.</p>
<p>NCO Group, which provides accounts receivable, management and related services, jumped 4-1/2 to 17-1/2 in its debut.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 8.65 to 1254.14.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 3.06 to 727.65, a record.</p>
