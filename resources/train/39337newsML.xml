<p>Italian police have arrested eight people suspected of clandestinely importing and selling Somali children, state RAI television reported.</p>
<p>It said the eight, seven Somalis and one Italian, were accused of selling the children for prices ranging from 30 to 50 million lire ($18,000 to 30,000).</p>
<p>The news agency ANSA quoted an unnamed investigator as saying the &quot;most optimistic hypothesis is that they were sold clandestinely for adoption. But that is being checked.&quot;</p>
<p>RAI said the children were bought from poor villages in Somalia and then brought into Italy by ship hidden in the boots of cars. Most were then sold on abroad.</p>
<p>The television reported that the ring had catalogues containing photographs of the children, whose ages ranged from six to 12 years old. One of those arrested was a lawyer well known in Rome's Somali community.</p>
