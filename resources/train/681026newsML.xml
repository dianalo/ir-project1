<headline>IPE Brent firmer on Iraq concern before OPEC talks.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent floated gently higher on Monday morning following a firm opening amid continued concern over tension between the United Nations and Iraq, traders and brokers said.</p>
<p>August Brent was trading at $17.95 a barrel at 1210 GMT, a gain of 28 cents from Friday's close, while July gas oil was $2.00 a tonne up at $160.50.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing too new recently but the problems between Iraq and the U.N. has caused a bit of concern,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution over the weekend threatening Iraq with further sanctions if it does not allow U.N. arms inspectors to search sensitive sites.</p>
<p>It also suspended until the end of October regular 60 day reviews of current sanctions.</p>
<p>&quot;The market on Friday did not expect to see such a negative U.N. stand on the Iraqi situation and I think the market is reacting to that today,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Ministers were starting to arrive in Vienna for this week's OPEC conference but brokers said this was not having an immediate impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are always quiet pre-OPEC,&quot; one said. &quot;There is a general consensus that there will be a roll over of their quotas but you never know what surprises they are going to come up with.&quot;</p>
<p>Technical traders were eyeing the key chart gap between $17.98 and $18.00 a barrel as the focus for resistance.</p>
