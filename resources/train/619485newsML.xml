<p>Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said it would hold a further meeting with British officials after talks on Wednesday aimed at rebuilding Northern Ireland's fraught peace process.</p>
<p>&quot;We reaffirmed Sinn Fein's right to be treated on the same basis as all the other parties and we have agreed to meet again,&quot; senior negotiator Caoimhghin O Caolain told reporters after the three-and-a-half hour meting.</p>
<p>He said there had been in-depth discussions about vexed issues that the republican delegation had raised last week when Britain ended a 16 month freeze on meetings between civil servants and Sinn Fein leaders.</p>
<p>The British government issued no statement after the talks.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein wants immediate entry to multi-party talks which reopen next Tuesday and from which it is currently barred because of IRA violence.</p>
<p>Britain says Sinn Fein will be given a seat at the talks when the IRA calls an irrevocable ceasefire, a demand the Irish guerrilla group has persistently spurned.</p>
<p>Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, who flies to South Africa on Thursday for events that will be attended by most of Northern Ireland's parties, said the province could learn from that country about how to resolve conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that all of us in Ireland have an awful lot to learn from the South Africans. These people resolved what was undoubtedly one of the most intractable problems the world has seen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland parties have been invited for three days to South Africa to speak to politicians and other leaders about how they tackled their peace process.</p>
<p>But politicians from strongly pro-British Protestant parties who cold-shoulder Sinn Fein at home are adamant that they will not associate with the group in any way in South Africa.</p>
<p>Wednesday's Belfast talks were held after Britain's new Labour government ended a ban on contact with the Irish party.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeking to ensure that a meaningful and inclusive process of peace negotiations is on offer. We are seeking to make progress on that today,&quot; McGuinness told reporters beforehand.</p>
<p>The United States has stepped up pressure on the IRA to declare a ceasefire, arguing that British Prime Minister Tony Blair's landslide election victory presented an opportunity to address the Northern Ireland conflict.</p>
<p>But as Sinn Fein went into the Belfast talks there were no indications that either side expected an early breakthrough that might lead to a truce by the outlawed IRA.</p>
<p>The IRA is fighting to end London's rule over Northern Ireland and unite it with predominantly Roman Catholic Ireland.</p>
<p>Peace hopes are also clouded by violence from pro-British Loyalist guerrillas and fears that contentious parades by Protestants could spark a rerun of riots that plunged the province into chaos last year.</p>
<p>Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam, who travels to Dublin on Thursday for talks with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, signalled her belief that a Loyalist bomb planted in Ireland last Sunday did not breach a fragile Loyalist truce.</p>
<p>&quot;My personal view is that the CLMC (Combined Loyalist Military Command) did not know of the action that was taken in Dundalk,&quot; she told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bomb, which failed to explode in the border town of Dundalk, was left by a renegade Protestant militia outside the control of the CLMC which has operated a volatile truce since October 1994.</p>
<p>Mowlam held meetings with leaders of the Protestant Orange Order and Apprentice Boys organisations and spokesmen for a Protestant &quot;right to march&quot; group to ease tension about summer marches that go through Catholic zones.</p>
<p>Catholics say the marches are sectarian and inflammatory. Protestants say they are traditional displays of pride in British citizenship which Catholics want to undermine.</p>
