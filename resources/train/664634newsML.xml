<title>BELGIUM: Belgian shares seen sideways till midweek.</title>
<headline>Belgian shares seen sideways till midweek.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-06-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Belgian shares started unsteadily on Monday and dealers expected the market to remain nervous until mid-week, after the end of European Union summit in Amsterdam and the release of U.S. inflation data.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index  .BFX was down 3.59 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,396.77 by 0845 GMT, with a majority of the 20 leading blue chips in negative territory.</p>
<p>One trader said the price weakness was likely to prove temporary and should be treated as a buying opportunity. &quot;We went up 100 index points last week and people are just taking profit,&quot; he said. &quot;There's some uncertainty about the summit.&quot;  </p>
<p>The EU summit in Amsterdam, which ends on Tuesday, is debating French demands to add a jobs chapter to rules governing budgetary policy within the planned single currency area.</p>
<p>Bond and stock markets are also waiting for U.S. consumer price data on Tuesday to bury once and for all fears the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on July 1.</p>
<p>The trader noted the bid/ask prices on the Bel-20 index were wide, indicating uncertainty about the direction. Fundamentally, however, all factors were supportive, he said. &quot;I still see us reaching 2,450 points, but probably not this week.&quot;  </p>
<p>Twelve Bel-20 components were lower, five higher and three unchanged. Losers included chemicals and drugs group UCB, down 100 francs at 114,900 francs after starting the session 2,500 francs higher. UCB last week gained more than 16 percent after management confirmed the company was on track for healthy earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>Cement maker CBR was also a heavy loser, down 1.99 percent at 3,455 francs despite slightly underperforming the index this year. Bel-20 gainers were led by another index underperformer, steel cord and wire maker Bekaert, up 450 francs or 2.14 percent at 21,500 francs.  </p>
<p>Outside the Bel-20, bank Dexia CC was the main focus of attention, rising 1.96 percent to 3,900 francs, well above a secondary public offering of its shares, priced on Friday at 3,825 francs. The offering closes at the end of the month.</p>
<p>In Paris, Dexia's partner bank Credit Local de France, which tends to trade at a discount to the Belgian bank, was up six French francs at 581 francs, or around 3,570 Belgian francs.</p>
<p>Both issues were bucking the trend on their respective markets. -- Nick Antonovics, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6817</p>
