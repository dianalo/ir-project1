<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual is to keep his incumbent Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia in office to bolster government stability after last week's general election, a leading Algerian newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>The report coincided with a dispute among U.N. observers in Algeria to monitor the general election, the first in more than five years of violence.</p>
<p>A U.N. statement, published by local newspapers on Monday, said some observers had problems moving freely during monitoring the poll, and there were questions over voting by security forces and at mobile polling stations.</p>
<p>But the head of the Indian observers' delegation, named only as Mr Singh, denounced the statement as &quot;not objective&quot;.</p>
<p>He told reporters in Algiers: &quot;It is a report drawn up by four observers alone and does not represent the report of the United Nation's mission.&quot;</p>
<p>Most opposition parties said last Thursday's election was rife with irregularities. The ballot was dominated by the National Democratic Rally (RND) which took 155 seats in the 380-seat Assembly.  Ouyahia and several ministers stood on the RND ticket.</p>
<p>El Khabar daily, quoting what it called informed sources, said Ouyahia would hand in his government resignation to Zeroual on Monday shortly after the Constitutional Council endorses the poll results.</p>
<p>Zeroual will then reconduct Ouyahia as the head of a new reshuffled government, the paper said, adding that Finance and Oil Ministers Abdelkrim Harchaoui and Ammar Makhloufi were likely to stay in the upcoming reshuffled cabinet.</p>
<p>A senior official told Reuters Zeroual would name a prime minister in the &quot;next hours&quot; but refused to discuss speculation. He said Zeroual was entitled by the constutition to name a head of government or keep the incumbent one in his job.</p>
<p>The election law asserts that the Council has to confirm or reject the poll results 72 hours after the official announcement of the election results.</p>
<p>The official results, released on Friday, gave the Islamist- oriented Movement of a Peaceful Society (MPS) 69 seats to put it in second place after the RND. The former ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) ranked third with 64 seats followed by Islamist Nahda Movement with 34 seats.</p>
<p>Secularist Socialist Forces Front (FFS) and Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) won 19 seats each. Independents and other small groups shared the remaining seats in the house.</p>
<p>All main political parties complained of poll irregularities and asked the Council to look into their documentated complaints.</p>
<p>The U.N. observers' statement said: &quot;While observers were able to move without fear or threats, several had difficulties to carry out their work with all the independence and free movement necessary to assess objectively these elections.&quot;</p>
<p>It also said observers questioned what happened in the special voting buros, where security forces cast their ballots early.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority of observers who supervised them share the opinion that the process did not provide sufficient guarantees for neutrality and transparency,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The U.N. team cancelled a news conference in Algiers on Sunday when they had been due to give their verdict.</p>
<p>Instead, a statement was issued which one of the observers said on Monday was &quot;not about giving a judgment on the fairness of the elections. This is up to the Algerian people&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It gives facts and observations about the election.&quot;</p>
<p>El Khabar said the RND was most likely to forge an alliance with the former sole-ruling FLN party to get a majority in the National Assembly in order to secure stability for the government.</p>
<p>The Assembly will hold a maiden session on June 15 to elect the house speaker, party and official sources said.</p>
<p>Officials said the government would step up reforms, agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund, after the election, including a huge privatsation of state-owned enterprises.</p>
