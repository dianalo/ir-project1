<headline>OPTIONS - Bund volatility slides post-payrolls data.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-07</dateline>

<p>Bund volatility took a tumble after the release on key U.S. employment data on Friday, heading for the five percent level, traders said.</p>
<p>Volatility has been supported by the figures all week, as traders were unwilling to push it down when faced with a number which could swing the market violently.</p>
<p>Stripped of that support, volatility started to slide.</p>
<p>&quot;April is at 5.46-5.85 percent. That's down about a point -- it was 6.5 percent this morning. May would be about 5.6-5.7 percent and June 5.5-5.6 percent -- they're both down about half a point,&quot; said a trader at a British brokerage here.</p>
<p>February non-farm payrolls rose 339,000, compared with a forecast of 230,000. January was revised down to a rise of 247,000 from 271,000.</p>
<p>June Bund futures were up eight basis points at 101.75 by 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>Traders said volume was light ahead of the number, and had not been overwhelming afterwards because of the weekend.</p>
<p>A salesman at a European bank said activity was strongest in the front month, where the 101.00 strike puts and the 102.00 strike calls were the most active.</p>
<p>&quot;But there's still no clear direction, though it should go off a little further,&quot; he said. &quot;It could be a chance to buy volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>The British brokerage trader also said volume was unimpressive after the data, as the market moved in a rather directionless way.</p>
<p>The European bank salesman said he expected volatility to gravitate towards the five percent level during the coming week, although it would be difficult to break below there.</p>
