<p>Producer prices advanced modestly in September, the Labour Department said Friday, as moderate increases in food and energy prices helped to restrain the overall rate of wholesale inflation.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, after rising 0.3 percent in August. Excluding food and energy prices, the &quot;core rate&quot; of inflation moved up 0.3 percent due in part to higher prices for passenger cars and light trucks.</p>
<p>Analysts said the report confirmed that inflation remained relatively tame at the wholesale level. &quot;This tells us we've got moderate growth without inflation, so it confirms the status quo,&quot; said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.</p>
<p>The inflation-sensitive 30-year U.S. Treasury bond gained half a point in price, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.85 percent from 6.89 percent late Thursday.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a rise of 0.3 percent in the PPI, with a gain of 0.2 percent in the core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices.</p>
<p>In August, the core PPI fell 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>Economists have become increasingly concerned that rising labour costs in a tightening job market could lead to a pickup in inflation in the months ahead.</p>
<p>So far, inflation data have suggested that businesses are reluctant to pass along higher labour costs in the form of price increases. Labour costs, however, have a far bigger impact on the Consumer Price Index, which is due next Wednesday, than on the Producer Price Index.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation story is going to be the Consumer Price Index,&quot; said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.</p>
<p>Friday's report showed that food prices rose 0.2 percent in September, compared with a jump of 1.0 percent a month before. Beef, veal and fruit prices rose, while pork, poultry, fish and vegetable prices fell.</p>
<p>Energy prices gained 0.2 percent, after rising 0.7 percent in August. The increase was paced by a 0.9 percent jump in gasoline and a gain of 2.0 percent in heating oil prices.</p>
<p>Passenger car prices jumped 1.2 percent in September, posting the biggest one-month gain since November 1993, when prices rose 1.3 percent. Tobacco product prices fell 1.0 percent.</p>
<p>Prices of intermediate goods -- those that require further processing -- rose 0.3 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in August.</p>
