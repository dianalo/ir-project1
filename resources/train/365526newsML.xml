<p>Andrei Chesnokov salvaged a measure of pride for a losing Russian side when he upset world number eight Wayne Ferreira of South Africa in their Davis Cup reverse singles match on Sunday.</p>
<p>In the hottest temperatures of the World Group first round tie, the 31-year-old broke a lacklustre Ferreira twice in the deciding third set to win 6-2 6-7 (7-9) 6-2 in one hour and 47 minutes.</p>
<p>That gave South Africa a 3-1 victory overall in the tie to line up a probable second round clash away to Sweden in April.</p>
<p>The scheduled second reverse singles match between South Africa's Marcos Ondruska and Russia's Andrei Cherkasov was abandoned after the Russian played more than 30 games in the morning's doubles.</p>
<p>In that earlier match, the South African doubles pair of Ellis Ferreira and Grant Stafford outclassed the Russian combination of Andrei Olhovsky and Cherkasov 6-2 3-6 6-0 6-2 to give the home side an unassailable 3-0 lead in the tie.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a great feeling to have won this tie. We were expected to win but the first three matches were all tough. This victory is very satisfying,&quot; South African non-playing team captain Danie Visser said afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, the surface here in Durban was a little slow and the guys had to work very hard - but they managed to come through in the key matches.&quot;</p>
<p>On-court temperatures reached 42 degrees celsius as the South Africans swept through the first set 6-2 in only half an hour, with the left-handed Ferreira winning several points on crunching forehand drives.</p>
<p>The Russians fought back with three breaks of serve to take the second set 6-3 as Olhovsky, ranked 23rd in world doubles, began to mix powerful ground strokes with some intelligently-placed lobs.</p>
<p>&quot;They threw up a lot of lobs in that set and, for quite a while, the sun was right in our faces in the middle of the court,&quot; Ferreira said. &quot;But, once the sun moved, it wasn't that bad.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite intense humidity, the South Africans then upped a few gears to breeze through the next two sets 6-0 6-2 in only 45 minutes. They broke the Russians three times in the third set and twice in the fourth to seal overall victory for their country n the tie.</p>
