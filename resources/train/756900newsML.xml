<p>The body of Andrew Cunanan, the alleged killer of fashion king Gianni Versace, should not be allowed to be buried in his Filipino father's homeland, a leading Philippine senator said on Friday.</p>
<p>Cunanan committed suicide on Wednesday in Miami following a massive search after he was alleged to have killed Versace and four other men.</p>
<p>&quot;Andrew Cunanan is a product of American culture and owes nothing to his Bulacan roots. They should bury him in San Diego where he grew up and where his friends are,&quot; deputy Senate President Blas Ople said in a statement.</p>
<p>Both Ople and Cunanan's father are natives of Bulacan, a province north of the Philippine capital.</p>
<p>There has been no word yet on where Cunanan will be buried</p>
<p>&quot;Andrew Cunanan's burial in Bulacan will draw global attention to this province on the eve of the glorious centennial of Philippine independence, which was formalised in Malolos (in Bulacan).</p>
<p>&quot;Bulacan does not deserve to be part of Cunanan's global notoriety,&quot; Ople said.</p>
<p>Cunanan, called a &quot;high class prostitute&quot; by his mother, is alleged to have begun his killing spree in April.</p>
<p>Cornered in a houseboat a few miles from the elegant oceanfront mansion where he is accused of shooting Versace on July 15, the 27-year-old fugitive put a pistol in his mouth after a caretaker stumbled upon him, and pulled the trigger.</p>
