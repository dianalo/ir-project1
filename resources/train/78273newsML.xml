<p>Light tanks and troops with Kalashnikov automatic rifles sealed off the central square in the Armenian capital Yerevan on Thursday after fierce clashes on Wednesday between riot police and opposition demonstrators.</p>
<p>Reuters corrspondent Lawrence Sheets said the Republic Square, near the headquarters of opposition leader Vazger Manukyan, was completely quiet and even pedestrians were not allowed to cross it. There was no violence.  </p>
<p>Reuters Television producer Nino Ivanishvili witnessed a police raid on the headquarters of a small opposition party in the centre of Yerevan.</p>
<p>&quot;Armed people in camouflage broke into the building. They were dragging people out and punching and kicking them,&quot; she said. She saw at least seven severely beaten men being dragged into a police van.</p>
<p>President Levon Ter-Petrosyan has banned all rallies and demonstrations after fierce clashes in Yerevan between riot police and his political opponents.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan also vowed to punish all &quot;provocateurs&quot;, blaming them for Wednesday's clashes outside parliament in which at least seven people had been hurt.</p>
