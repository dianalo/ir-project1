<p>Five men arrested in the Atlantic aboard a ship carrying more than three tonnes of cannabis resin were charged in Britain on Friday with conspiracy to illegally import drugs, police said.</p>
<p>The men were among a crew of eight -- six Britons, a Turk and a Frenchman -- arrested off Portugal on Monday on the Maltese-registered Simon de Danser, a 279-tonne motor vessel. The three not yet charged were still being questioned, police said.</p>
<p>The men were brought to Plymouth on the south-west coast of England on Thursday aboard a Royal Navy destroyer.</p>
<p>Customs officers said the drugs found aboard the vessel had a street value of around 13 million pounds ($21 million).</p>
<p>The seized ship was due to arrive on Saturday in Plymouth where it would be thoroughly searched, a Customs spokesman said. &quot;There may be more drugs concealed on the vessel which were not obvious to the boarding party,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the ship had been seized as part of a joint operation with British police and enforcement agencies from seven other European countries.</p>
