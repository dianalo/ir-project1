<p>The Indian cabinet has approved partial disinvestment of government stakes in four major state-controlled companies, a government spokesman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet has approved disinvestment of part of the shareholding in Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL), Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL), Container Corporation of India (CCI) and the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), &quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The decision (to disinvest) is likely to be implemented before the end of March 1998,&quot; he said. &quot;It is indicated that the amount of 48 billion rupees will be achieved from this disinvestment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The government has set a revenue target of 48 billion rupees ($1.34 billion) from its programme to sell state shareholding in the current 1997/98 (April-March) fiscal year.</p>
<p>The spokesman said in the case of GAIL, the government's Disinvestment Commission set up last year had recommended the sale of up to 25 percent of the government's equity.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been accepted by the government. This amounts to 210 million shares,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If this disinvestment is achieved, the government shareholding would come down to 71.63 percent,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>The commission called for the government to divest part of its stake in MTNL, which runs telephone services in Bombay and Delhi, and offer to issue new shares, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The core group (of officials) has proposed an offer of 47 million shares along with a fresh issue of 60 million shares. The government share will thus come down to 52.6 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>MTNL has already sold off 34.27 percent of its shares to the public.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the cabinet approved an offering of 12.5 million new shares in Container Corporation of India (Concor), along with the disinvestment of six million existing shares.</p>
<p>&quot;After this, the government shareholding would come down to 66 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Disinvestment Commission recommended in May that Concor's government stake should be cut to 51 percent from the current 77 percent.  </p>
<p>The spokesman said the cabinet renewed on Friday an approval given earlier for the Indian Oil Corp to sell up to 20 million shares. &quot;However, when it would be done, would be decided by the core group,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the cabinet had earlier approved disinvestment of up to 5 percent of equity in IOC.</p>
<p>India began selling partial stakes in state companies under an economic reform programme launched in 1991. The government set up the Disinvestment Commission to advise on the strategy to take up the partial privatisation programme.</p>
