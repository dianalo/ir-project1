<p>The Senate Energy Committee again postponed a vote on whether to approve Federico Pena as the next energy secretary, a committee spokesman said Monday.</p>
<p>The committee's meeting to vote on Pena, set for Wednesday, had not yet been rescheduled, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the meeting was postponed partly because the committee still was checking some information on the former transportation secretary, and because it did not appear all the members would be back in Washington by Wednesday, after the congressional recess.</p>
<p>A Coast Guard employee, Robert Baggan, was to hold a news conference Tuesday to urge Congress to delay Pena's nomination.</p>
<p>Baggan claimed Pena was involved with &quot;costly and fraudulent&quot; contracts while he was transportation secretary in President Clinton's first term.</p>
<p>The committee postponed an earlier vote while it looked into the Coast Guard contract matter and other questions about Pena. The spokesman declined to comment on whether the Coast Guard contract was still a concern.</p>
