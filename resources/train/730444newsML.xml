<p>The U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia said on Tuesday a war crimes suspect held in in the Hague after his arrest in Bosnia last week, needed &quot;several days' monitoring&quot; in a prison hospital.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic was arrested by British forces on Thursday last week as part of &quot;Operation Tango&quot;, a crackdown on indicted war criminals still living in the Prijedor region of northwestern Bosnia.</p>
<p>He was flown to the tribunal's detention cells in the Hague the same day.</p>
<p>Kovacevic underwent a medical after his arrival in the Hague during which &quot;the doctor discovered the existence of pathological problems which call for the accused to be placed under supervision,&quot; the tribunal said in a statement.</p>
<p>A tribunal spokeswoman said she had no further details of Kovacevic's condition other than that the problem was of a physical rather than mental nature.</p>
<p>The hospitalisation would mean a date for his initial appearance before the U.N. war crimes court would not be set before early next week, the tribunal added.</p>
<p>Another suspect targeted by &quot;Operation Tango&quot;, Simo Drljaca, was shot dead by British soldiers as they tried to arrest him. Drljaca, the notorious hard-line former police chief of Prijedor has since been buried and honoured as a fallen hero.</p>
<p>Both men had not known they were the subject of secret tribunal indictments.</p>
<p>The Prijedor purge was one of the worst crimes against civilians in Bosnia's war. Serbs led a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign in the early stages of the 1992-1995 war, herding Moslems and Croats into detention camps, where they tortured, beaten, and in some cases, executed.</p>
<p>Dusan Tadic, the first Bosnian Serb to be tried by the Hague-based tribunal for war crimes, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Monday for his part in atrocities in Prijedor.</p>
