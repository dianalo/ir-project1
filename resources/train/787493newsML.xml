<p>The pilot of the battered helicopter carrying food, mosquito repellent, supplies and miners shut off the noisy rotors and announced that fog had again made the trip to Russia's most prosperous gold mine impossible.</p>
<p>Workers would eventually wait three days before driving 12 hours overnight to get a flight from a closer city to reach the mine in the isolated Far East.</p>
<p>The canceled flight was just one of many obstacles the Omolon Gold Mining Company, a $228 million Russian-American joint venture, faces on a daily basis but has largely overcome in quickly building Russia's leading gold mining company.</p>
<p>&quot;Construction started in August 1995, and we mined our first gold in February 1997. That's a hell of an accomplishment,&quot; said Canadian director 64-year-old Stephen Harapiak. &quot;It borders on the miraculous.&quot;</p>
<p>The mine in Kubaka is 1,000 km (620 miles) towards Alaska from Magadan, the bleak regional centre on the Pacific Ocean built by prison labour as the gateway to the most notorious of Josef Stalin's Gulag camps of the 1930s-50s.</p>
<p>Cut off from roads, settlements and other signs of outside human life, the mine relies on helicopters for all but about three winter months when temperatures drop to as low as -60 Celsius (-76 Fahrenheit) and trucks can come in over the ice.</p>
<p>Despite the remote location, upstart Omolon, a joint venture between U.S.-based Cyprus Amax Minerals and five Russian enterprises, projects 1997 output of 7.5 tonnes of gold and increasing it to 11 tonnes next year, the highest for any company in gold-rich Russia.</p>
<p>HIGH-LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT</p>
<p>With costs of extracting the gold from an open pit at $175 an ounce, Harapiak says the company can make a good profit on its investment, which was backed by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to the tune of $130 million and embraced by the bilateral commission of U.S. Vice President Albert Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>That high political profile has helped Omolon get money for its output from the Russian government, which only recently allowed banks to directly export gold. A crisis had long been growing in the industry because the government had fallen behind in its payments to many domestic gold mining companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Omolon also has faced these problems, but we have lobbied the government to honour their obligations to foreign investors,&quot; said Magadan region's Deputy Governor Vecheslav Kobets. &quot;And it works because Gore and Chernomyrdrin gave their guarantees and our guests here are very respected.&quot;</p>
<p>Under their agreement, Omolon waits for the Russian government to deposit money, half in dollars and half in roubles, into a blocked account before they release their gold. &quot;We have already made two sales under our agreement,&quot; said Ilya Rozenblyum ,Omolon's chairman of the board.</p>
<p>OASIS IN RUGGED REGION</p>
<p>To the 387 Russians and about 20 foreigners working at the Kubaka mine, the facility is something of an oasis in the Magadan region, a frontier area 8,000 km (5,000 miles) east of Moscow with no rail system and mostly dirt roads.</p>
<p>Magadan is suffering a shutdown of several weeks of the centralised hot water system for annual repairs, but miners at Kubaka can still take a hot shower in their modern lodgings, which also offer a games room, gym and a canteen praised by the workers. Alcohol is banned, to the disappointment of some.</p>
<p>Workers at the mine put in a 12-hour day, seven-day week before they are rotated out every month for two weeks off. &quot;We demand a hell of a lot of our people,&quot; said Harapiak. &quot;The people who don't respond to that kind of management don't last.&quot;</p>
<p>The remoteness effectively ensures that workers spend most of their time making gold. &quot;You're way out there and pretty much removed in the world,&quot; said Bryan Rocque, a 30-year-old temporary drilling instructor. &quot;Every new day is just like any other day.&quot;</p>
<p>Like Idaho-native Rocque, most foreigners are from the U.S. West or Canadians experienced in the ways of remote mines.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm always looking for something new and new frontiers,&quot; said mining engineer Bob Falletta, 46, who worked for five years in the heart of an Indonesian rain forest. &quot;It's not being in the best location that's critical to me. Some people really like what they do and I'm one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that his wages were far better than those he might earn in the United States.</p>
<p>Most Russian miners get a base salary of $425 to $475 a month, plus another 40 percent for long hours, Harapiak said. Although the wage is more than double the Russian average, some grumble that Omolon is not generous enough in a region of high prices. Harapiak responded that he pays a market wage and that almost no one has voluntarily quit an Omolon job.</p>
<p>About a dozen people work as the mine's security force and the isolation helps the company avoid the theft of gold that plagues much of the industry elsewhere. &quot;We have very strict controls for the entire process,&quot; said Rozenblyum. &quot;We use technology that keeps such opportunities to a minimum.&quot;</p>
<p>A few workers have, however, tried to pilfer equipment and were fired as a result, Harapiak said.</p>
<p>The company has had problems finding skilled workers in accounting and warehousing, Harapiak says, no small matter when they have to ship in 20,000 tonnes of fuel and another 10-15,000 tonnes of supplies when the winter road is running.</p>
<p>Overall the company credits skilled, educated workers, new technology and an usually rich site for its success so far. The company's mining engineers say the pit yields about 3/4 of an ounce of gold per tonne, unusually rich by industry standards.</p>
<p>Omolon is also spending $5 million to explore two other regional sites and in about a year should know if the first is economically feasible to mine. &quot;The exploration potential is extremely exciting,&quot; said Harapiak. &quot;I think Omolon will become a very large mining company.&quot;</p>
