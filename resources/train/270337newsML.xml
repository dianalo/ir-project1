<p>The nation's most successful car dealership owner pleaded innocent in federal court on Friday to charges that he bribed executives of American Honda Motor Co. to get dealerships and cars.</p>
<p>Honda car dealer Rick Hendrick appeared before a federal magistrate in an Asheville courtroom, where his lawyer entered a plea of innocent. Hendrick did not speak except to acknowledge to the judge that he had read the charges against him.</p>
<p>His brother, John, also was arraigned on a single conspiracy count.</p>
<p>Hendrick faces 16 charges for allegedly bribing executives of Honda Motor Co Ltd's American Honda Motor Co with cash and BMWs, according to an indictment issued earlier this month. In exchange, prosecutors claim that Hendrick was given an unfair advantage in the lucrative Honda market during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Hendrick, who is based in Charlotte, last year owned 67 dealerships in the United States with combined sales of more than $2.1 billion. On average, his dealerships were selling some $4,000 worth of new cars each minute.</p>
<p>He led the nation's second-largest car dealer by more than $800 million in sales, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Prosecutors charged Hendrick with 16 counts of money laundering, conspiracy and mail fraud for allegedly bribing Honda officials to obtain popular cars that were allocated to protect smaller dealers. Several executives with American Honda have pleaded guilty or been convicted of accepting bribes of fur coats, Rolex watches and cash from various U.S. dealers eager to obtain the cars.</p>
<p>Three civil court cases filed by dealers against Hendrick are awaiting trial in North Carolina, and several others have been consolidated and will be heard in federal court in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Hendrick helped found the Charlotte Hornets sports team, owned a NASCAR racing team that won the Winston Cup during the past two years and is a friend of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.</p>
