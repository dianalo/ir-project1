<p>Hong Kong people's confidence in their future as part of China dropped considerably on the eve of the territory's handover, according to a poll by a newspaper on Monday.</p>
<p>The poll, by the Chinese-language Apple Daily newspaper and the Chinese University of Hong Kong last Monday and Tuesday, showed waning confidence in China's promise of &quot;one country two systems&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong&quot;.</p>
<p>Altogether 618 people were interviewed and the results were compared against similar polls done over the past few months.</p>
<p>The number of people who said they had less confidence in China's promises had grown from 12.9 per cent last month to 24.2 per cent this month.</p>
<p>More people said they were pessimistic about the future. The number had risen from 15.1 percent in February to 20.8 percent this month.</p>
<p>The number of people who believed they would have more democracy fell from last month's 7.3 percent to 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>Similar pessimism was recorded on the future of human rights and basic freedoms.</p>
<p>A British colony for 156 years, Hong Kong will revert to China at midnight Monday.</p>
