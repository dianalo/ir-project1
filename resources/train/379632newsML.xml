<p>Police seized 12 million Swiss francs ($8.2 million) in forged notes in Switzerland's biggest counterfeiting haul, but prosecutors said on Friday over three million francs might have eluded them.</p>
<p>A Swiss printer, who served a 1970s jail term for counterfeiting, and two Italian men were arrested when the cash was found in a raid on Thursday in the city of Kreuzlingen on the German border at Lake Constance.</p>
<p>&quot;There is evidence that three million (counterfeit Swiss francs) were delivered to Italy and 200,000 to Germany,&quot; federal prosecutors said in a statement.</p>
<p>Swiss and German police zeroed in on the suspected counterfeiters after fake 1,000 notes turned up shortly before Christmas in a Swiss bank and a department store, the prosecutors said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reproduction quality of the forgeries is very good and the danger of confusing them with real ones is very high,&quot; the statement said. &quot;This is the largest amount of counterfeit Swiss francs ever seized in this country.&quot;</p>
<p>It said the notes were produced on an off-set printer. The main signs of forgery were paper that was too thick and the fact that the water sign and a thin metal saftey thread were printed rather than being implanted in the paper.</p>
<p>The Swiss man arrested in the raid was convicted by a Swiss court in 1977 of counterfeiting and sentenced to four years in prison, a prosecution spokesman said. He declined to reveal any details of the two Italian men.</p>
