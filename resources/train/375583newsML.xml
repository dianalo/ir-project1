<title>USA: Technical bounce lifts Ecuador, Bulgaria debts.</title>
<headline>Technical bounce lifts Ecuador, Bulgaria debts.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ecuador and Bulgaria, the walking wounded of the emerging markets, staged a mild technical rally outperforming other Brady bonds, but market sentiments remained cautious, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Spreads for other Bradies tightened about 10 basis points in a late surge powered by the buying spree after the 30-year U.S. Treasury refunding, they said.</p>
<p>Ecuador Bradies appeared to have found a temporary bottom as the new interim president Fabian Alarcon began forming his government.  </p>
<p>Reaction among U.S. analysts to the appointment of Carlos Davalos as the new Finance Minister of Ecuador was lukewarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Davalos is a politician of the old school,&quot; said Jaime Valdivia, vice president and Latin American economist at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>While not a top-notch choice, Davalos is likely to command respect among squabbling factions in the Congress, he said.</p>
<p>Still, the current crisis of Ecuador is far from winding down and the situation remained highly volatile, Valdivia said.  </p>
<p>Besides the task of holding the unwieldly coalition in the Congress together, Alarcon must tackle the fiscal deficit, which could reach 4 to 5 percent of the gross domestic product this year, he predicted.</p>
<p>Rafael de la Fuente, analyst at Paribas Securities, also considered Ecuador's economy to be precarious, even though the prospect of default on its debts is not imminent.  </p>
<p>Ecuador had to face about $350 million in mostly interest payment for its Brady debt this year, which, given its $2 billion in foreign currency reserves, is not overly onerous. But the continuing crisis could put strain on the fiscal deficit and its ability to meet payment for bank loans, he said.</p>
<p>Ecuador Pars rose a full point to bid 45-3/4 and Ecuador PDI gained 5/8 to bid 61-1/8.</p>
<p>Compared to Ecuador, Bulgaria appeared to have turned the corner as the interim cabinet buckled down to deal with the collpasing economy.  </p>
<p>&quot;Bulgaria is farther along on getting its acts together,&quot; said a trader. President Petar Stoyanov on Wednesay appointed a caretaker cabinet to govern until elections on April 19.</p>
<p>Bulgaria IAB was quoted 56-1/2 bid in late afternoon trading, up 1-1/8 on the day.</p>
<p>Another Andean country, Colombia, also took the spotlight with its $1 billion two-tranche global bond. The 10-year tranche was priced 130 basis points over U.S. Treasuries and the 30-year tranche 170 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the prices were at the high end of expected range, reflecting strong demand from investors who were willing to overlook the ongoing strikes and the risks that &quot;decertification&quot; may pose on its economy.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton must decide by March 1 whether to remove Colombia from a list of nations that have failed to participate actively enough in the anti-drug fight. To be &quot;decertified&quot; for the second consecutive year increases the likelihood of economic sanctions, analysts said.</p>
