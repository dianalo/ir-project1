<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended firmer after an unexpected afternoon surge on Monday, but dealers said volumes remained relatively light due to the absence of many local players for the Moslem New Year holiday.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 March contract ended 355 points higher at 18,195 after trading in a 500-point range and hitting a high of 18,329. Turnover was 15,355 lots.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Nikkei markets were supported by the dollar's decline against the yen after a weekend Group of Seven meeting signalled a desire for currency stability and noted that misalignments in exchange markets had been corrected.  </p>
<p>&quot;The dollar/yen exchange rate is stabilising towards a more comfortable level for many people,&quot; said a trader with a Japanese house.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 122.80/90 yen at 0620 GMT after falling as low as 120.30 yen in early Asian trade. It closed at 123.08/18 yen in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the release of weaker-than-expected Japanese private machinery orders data for December had little impact on the market, as did a statement by Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka that Japan would firmly support its 20 major banks in their efforts to resolve their bad loan problems.  </p>
<p>&quot;They've been doing that for a long time. Last week, they said they would support the major banks and allow the smaller ones to wind up,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>He said the March Nikkei had not strayed outside its recent range despite Monday's volatility.</p>
