<p>Canadian 88 Energy Corp chief executive Greg Noval said his firm scrapped a C$652 million bid for Morrison Petroleums Ltd because it saw less value in the company, not over fear of regulatory reprisals.</p>
<p>Noval, reached on Sunday at his ranch south of Calgary, said he believed a hearing slated for Monday before the Ontario and Alberta securities commissions would have cleared Canadian 88 of wrongdoing in connection with pre-bid trading of Morrison stock by associated West Central Capital Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;That disclosure had all been ironed out between our lawyers and the commissions,&quot; Noval said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're not pointing our finger at the commission at all. We're pointing it at Morrison -- the value is not there.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the hearing before securities regulators, which had been scheduled for Monday in Toronto, had been cancelled in light of Canadian 88 walking away from its bid.</p>
<p>In a surprising turnaround, Canadian 88 said it was dropping its hostile cash-and-stock offer for Morrison after extending the bid late Friday.</p>
<p>Noval stressed that Canadian 88 did not launch its bid to &quot;make a quick flip on the stock.&quot;  </p>
<p>Canadian 88 said in a statement that it received new information from scouts -- people hired to secretly glean data about competitors' drilling operations -- about Morrison's natural gas exploration in the foothills of southern Alberta.</p>
<p>The data, received on Saturday morning, suggested a much-watched well was either dry or would yield little gas, he said. Foothills drilling acreage owned by Morrison was seen as the strategic key behind Canadian 88's bid. The region is known for potentially rich gas reserves and deep, complex and expensive drilling.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be one thing if it was an eastern Alberta well or a northern Alberta well where it would only cost C$100,000 dollars to drill, but these wells are several million dollars,&quot; Noval said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our directors also looked at the golden parachutes and some of the other aspects that were popping out through the middle of the offer and we re-assessed them in light of the new data.&quot;</p>
<p>Noval said his offer was further complicated by Canadian 88's falling stock price, which lowered the value of the share exchange.</p>
