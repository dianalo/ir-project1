<p>Palladium prices stormed to a 17-year high on news of a strike in South Africa amid tight physical supplies, in active trade in world commodity markets on Wednesday.</p>
<p>GOLD/PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>While palladium and platinum prices surged, gold shrugged off an emerging tussle between Germany's central bank and government over revaluating reserves.</p>
<p>NYMEX spot June palladium settled $28.15 higher at $202.65 an ounce, just off the high of $204.00. September, December and June 1998 contracts all settled $6.00 limit up, the maximum allowed in the forwards.</p>
<p>The run up in palladium and platinum, the latter back to February's highs, followed news of a wildcat strike at Amplats Rustenburg mine in South Africa, the world's biggest.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum settled $13.50 firmer at $410.50 an ounce, traded $411.00 to $396.50.</p>
<p>Leading funds such as Tiger reportedly hold huge long positions in palladium and would make attractive sums by taking profits, dealers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile gold and silver were largely focusing on the platinum group metals, with rangebound gold trying to glean strength from them despite a huge $65 gold discount to platinum.</p>
<p>The yellow metal barely moved when Germany's central bank said it disagreed with government plans to revalue national reserves, a move which rattled the markets when first mooted.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold settled 60 cents firmer, unable to stray from its narrow range of $345.50 to $343.10. Bullion in late afternoon dealings was quoted at $344.60/$345.10 an ounce.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Copper prices posted a strong finish just above $2,530 resistance on Wednesday after surging to fresh one-year highs during an active afternoon session. Speculative fund and bank buying, combined with shortcovering, whisked three months prices to a high of $2,539 per tonne in the first ring, traders said. Copper finished the kerb just lower at $2,531 -- a gain of $24 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>The market was generally neutral to news that the Kennecott Utah Copper Corp's smelter was back on stream and is due to reach full capacity later in the year. The 310,000 short tons per year smelter was shut for 42 days for maintenance.</p>
<p>The other metals were mixed.</p>
<p>Nickel tried to recover early in the day but failed to hold onto its gains and slipped back below $7,300. It ended at $7,280 versus $7,301 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Aluminium was quiet but firmer with copper at $1,645, up $9. Further consolidation looked likely for aluminium with support around $1,625, anlaysts said.</p>
<p>Zinc was quiet and unchanged at $1,360, after making a foray towards the recent 4-1/2 year high of $1,670.</p>
<p>Lead perked up with copper and was $7 firmer at $641.</p>
<p>But tin lost its footing and slid to the lowest in some three weeks. Prices finished near the day's lows at $5,665, off $65.</p>
<p>Alloy was marked $15 higher at $1,505/$1,510.</p>
<p>WHEAT</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures closed mixed as the market found late support, mainly in the nearby contracts, on a surge in old crop soybeans, traders said. Wheat was struggling to stay even early and tumbled at one stage during trading, on fund long liquidation tied to improving conditions of the U.S. wheat crop. CBOT soft red winter wheat closed 3-1/2 cents per bushel higher to four lower, with July up 3-1/2 at $3.67.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX crude oil futures ended flat to firmer, quietly consolidating Tuesday's steep losses ahead of the weekly inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, due after the session's close. July crude settled unchanged at $20.79 a barrel after dropping 84 cents Tuesday. Wednesday's inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute was expected to offer little direction to the market, traders said, as figures were anticipated to show only mild changes.  </p>
