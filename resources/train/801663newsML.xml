<p>Police appeared to play down casualties in Kenya's tourist haven south of the Indian Ocean city of Mombasa as security forces hunted attackers responsible for the latest blow to the government in an election year.</p>
<p>National Police Spokesman Peter Kimanthi said on Friday evening a major security operation was under way in the area but the situation had returned to normal and tension had eased.</p>
<p>There was little sign, however, of tension lessening on the ground in the village of Matuga, 25 km (15 km) south of Mombasa and the local headquarters for a police, army and navy manhunt.</p>
<p>Reinforcements from the crack paramilitary General Service Unit were trucked on Friday night into the area, which is hilly and has caves where police thought their attackers might hide.</p>
<p>Nearly all Matuga's residents had fled and most people seemed too scared of security forces to speak to reporters.</p>
<p>Several hundred frightened local residents trekked on Friday to shelter at a Roman Catholic church compound in the town of Likoni south of Mombasa, carrying a few belongings on their heads.</p>
<p>Kimanthi said in Nairobi that six police and seven civilians including five attackers were killed in Wednesday's well-organised night-long raid on police posts in Likoni.</p>
<p>He said a seventh policeman had died on Thursday and one more civilian had died on Friday, raising the toll to 15 dead,</p>
<p>&quot;Those are the bodies we have in the mortuary. If there are other bodies in the bush we don't know about them,&quot; said Kimanthi, denying reports that any police had been abducted.</p>
<p>But a security officer, who declined to be identified, said at least 21 people were killed in the raid and attacks since then, and seven police including three policewomen were missing.</p>
<p>The security officer told Reuters that four dead civilians were found on Thursday night and two more near Likoni on Friday.</p>
<p>Kenya's commercial KTN television put the toll at 20 dead.</p>
<p>Men from the police, General Service Unit, army and navy took part in Friday's manhunt backed by helicopters.</p>
<p>A total of 43 people have been arrested since the Likoni raid.</p>
<p>The search operation involving hundreds of men stretched through a tourist haven from Mombasa to the Tanzanian border, but there were no reports of casualties among the thousands of foreign tourists in the area of white coral sand beaches.</p>
<p>Hotel shuttle buses were suspended on Friday and tourists told to stay on hotel property until security was restored.</p>
<p>Scores of attackers armed with machetes seized 28 police issue G-3 rifles and two sub-machineguns on Wednesday and also burned two police posts at Likoni and freed Kenyan prisoners.</p>
<p>Several slogans painted on walls near Matuga pointed to a political motive exacerbated by tribal and land tensions.</p>
<p>&quot;These are not criminals. These are not thugs. Federalism,&quot; said one. &quot;Federalism. Mainlanders should go to their homes,&quot; said another. &quot;Federalism. Justice and Land,&quot; said a third.</p>
<p>President Daniel arap Moi's government has been put under pressure since May by an opposition-backed alliance demanding democratic reforms before a general election this year. Police violently breaking up rallies have rattled investors and tourists.</p>
<p>Kenya's central bank appealed on Friday to foreign investors not to quit East Africa's largest market after the International Monetary Fund halted a key aid package, citing corruption.</p>
<p>Investors pulled out of Kenya's usually lucrative weekly auction of treasury bills on Thursday because of uncertainty. The row with the IMF has hit the shilling currency and jolted investors.</p>
