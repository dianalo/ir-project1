<headline>CU up as fresh bid talk creates squeeze.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Commercial Union Plc were squeezed sharply higher for a second day on Friday in a strong insurance sector, as a fresh outbreak of bid speculation left market makers short of stock, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>The stock was up 19p at 664 by 1104 GMT, near the intraday high for the year of 674p set January 29. Volume was a moderate 1.7 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rumour mill is churning out all sorts of stories,&quot; said David Hudson, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, &quot;the composites have been left behind as the financials have been leading the market up, and it's time for them to catch up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Add a few rumours and that prevents any sellers.&quot;  </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the composite insurance sector, Royal Sun Alliance Plc was up 8p at 426-1/2 and General Accident Plc rose 7-1/2p at 732-1/2.</p>
<p>Speculation yesterday of a bid from a continental European bank or insurance group was joined today by talk that ABN Amro could be interested in CU's Dutch unit Delta Lloyd, traders and analysts said.  </p>
<p>Yesterday CU shares rose 19p amid talk that BZW was preparing a research note, arguing that composite insurers were due a re-rating and that CU offered the best value in the sector, with a target price of over 800p.</p>
<p>Analysts at the brokerage were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Separately NatWest on Thursday raised Guardian Royal Exchange Plc, up 6-/2p at 271-1/2, to &quot;add&quot; from &quot;hold.&quot;  </p>
<p>Traders said recent upgrades and bid talk had created a stock shortage, squeezing prices higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been caught short and it is all a bit squeezy,&quot; said one market-maker.</p>
