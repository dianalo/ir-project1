<p>Shanghai B shares soared on Wednesday on bullish market sentiment, with trading volume the second highest on record, brokers said. The record was set on May 16, 1994 when the market also started a bull run.</p>
<p>The index jumped 2.494 points or 3.98 percent to 65.133 points, on volume of 69.3 million shares worth $27.6 million. All 42 B shares traded, with 34 up, five flat and three down.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors had fully recovered their confidence, believing that the market was entering a new bullish period, with China's economy greatly improved.</p>
<p>The index hit a two-year record high of 66.314 points late in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has risen for the fourth day in a row, with overseas institutions building positions, and the upward trend will continue, with a short-term technical correction that will provide buying opportunities for investors,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Breaching the 64-point level today indicates the beginning of a real bull run,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some stocks which have risen little in the past few days are waiting for their turn to rise,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Shanghai Erfangji was the star, surging $0.028 or 21.21 percent to $0.160, on volume of 2.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai Shangling Electric Appliance followed, jumping $0.072 or 18.36 percent to $0.464, on volume of 412,000 shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai Worldbest traded the most on institutions building positions, up $0.018 or 5.59 percent to $0.340, on volume of 5.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index rallied on bullish sentiment after a short-term consolidation and the index is expected to rise further in the next days, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index rose 49.314 points or 4.18 percent to 1227.926 points, on volume of 1.3 billion shares worth 12.6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE 30 blue-chip index rose 69.253 points or 2.52 percent to 2822.166 points.</p>
<p>Ningbo Huatong was the star on speculative buying, up 2.54 yuan or 19.15 percent to 15.80 yuan, on volume of 2.7 million shares.</p>
