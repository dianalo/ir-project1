<p>W.R. Grace &amp; Co said Tuesday its  Davison division, a supplier of catalysts and silica products, posted &quot;essentially flat&quot; fourth quarter sales and earnings.</p>
<p>For all of 1996, however, Davison generated record sales of $732 million, and pretax operating earnings increased 15 percent.</p>
<p>Silica products, the company said, as well as polyolefin and hydroprocessing catalysts, experienced strong global sales growth and double- digit pretax operating income improvements in the quarter and the full year.</p>
<p>Volume increased modestly in 1996 for fluid cracking catalysts, but income fell significantly, said Grace, due to intense pricing pressures.</p>
<p>During the year, Davison consolidated facilities, centralized administration and procurement, and impoved its manufacturing processes said Grace. These efforts, said the company, improved operating margins modestly, despite lower prices in some categories and the start-up expenses of its Malaysian silicas plant.  </p>
<p>Grace Packaging, the company's maker of packaging and container sealants, said fourth quarter sales increased in all regions, but softness in the North American pork and European beef market segments continued to hurt the rate of overall sales and earnings growth.</p>
<p>Sales for all of 1996 were up two percent compared to 1995, a year in which sales grew at an unprecedented rate of 18 percent from those of 1994, said the company.  Pretax operating income increased slightly, as volume increases offset unfavorable price/mix.</p>
