<p>Singapore's non-oil domestic exports rose a higher-than-expected nominal 8.8 percent in June year-on-year, the Trade Development Board (TDB) said on Monday.</p>
<p>They fell 1.0 percent in May and a Reuters poll of 12 economists last week had forecast a 6.3 percent rise for June, when the TDB said Singapore exported goods worth Singapore $7.45 billion.</p>
<p>The TDB said global electronics demand -- which fuels some 70 percent of Singapore's non-oil domestic exports -- had begun a turnaround likely to continue in the coming months.  </p>
<p>&quot;However, competition in the industry is likely to intensify. This will exert downward pressure on prices of key electronic products, resulting in a squeeze in profit margin,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>That was evident in the 29 percent decline in prices of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips since March 1997, the statement said.</p>
<p>Similarly, major personal computer makers have been slashing prices to maintain market share in highly competitive markets, it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;On balance, TDB's assessment is that the earlier projected total trade growth of five to seven percent for 1997 would be achieved,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>In real terms, non-oil exports rose 11.2 percent in June to S$9.69 billion after rising 0.6 percent in May.</p>
<p>Singapore's non-oil domestic exports expanded by 4.4 pct in the second quarter after contracting by 4.1 percent in the first quarter, the TDB said.</p>
<p>For the first half of 1997, the growth was 0.2 percent.  </p>
<p>Total trade rose by 5.3 percent in the second quarter of 1997, reversing the 2.5 percent contraction in the first quarter.</p>
<p>For the first half of 1997, total trade growth was 1.4 percent.</p>
