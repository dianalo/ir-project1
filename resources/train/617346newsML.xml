<p>Indian call money ended Tuesday unchanged at 4.5-5.0 percent, little changed from Monday's close of 4.75-5.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said Tuesday's trade was range-bound with most of the day's deals at 4.75-5.0 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity with banks was good and was expected to remain easy despite a 30 billion rupee auction of three-year federal government bonds scheduled for May 28.</p>
<p>They said around 17 billion rupees had come into the banking system last week and around 8.5 billion was expected this week through interest payments on government securities and redemption of stocks.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dollar purchases in the forex market would also add to the supply of funds, they said. The RBI has been buying dollars to keep the rupee from rising against the dollar.</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of government securities were largely steady in light trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some sideway movement in prices, but nothing significant,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Market players are awaiting the bond auction results before taking fresh positions.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the 13.25 percent 2000 stock traded on Tuesday at 102.70 rupees against its last traded 102.65, the 13.40 percent 1999 at 104.37 against 104.35 and the 14 percent 2006 at 101.43 against 106.40.</p>
<p>The 13.05 percent 2007 traded at 100.87 against 100.85.</p>
<p>Dealers said the treasury bill maturing on April 24, 1998 traded at a yield of 9.5 percent.</p>
