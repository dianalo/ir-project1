<headline>TI confirms Mannesmann sells stake in company.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>TI Group Plc on Thursday confirmed that Mannesmann of Germany had sold its near nine percent stake in the UK firm, following a placing of stock in the London market in early trading.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for TI said Mannesmann had sold the stake as part of a decision to focus its activities on the telecoms, engineering and automotive areas. He said the sale did not reflect any disappointment in TI's performance.</p>
<p>TI shares were down 8p at 556-1/2 in heavy volume of 52.6 million shares.</p>
<p>In a later statement, TI chairman Sir Christopher Lewington said the company's collaboration with Mannesmann over the past seven years had been helpful, particularly in developing its activities in Germany.  </p>
<p>&quot;I am confident that both companies will continue to pursue opportunities for collaboration wherever they may occur,&quot; Lewinton said.</p>
<p>Mannesmann chief executive Dr Joachim Funk said the decision &quot;...was based wholly on factors unconnected with TI where our investment has been extremely satisfactory. The management of TI retains our full confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mannesmann is focusing its investments in telecommunications, engineering and automotive and had recently undertaken significant additional commitments in telecommunications ventures,&quot; Funk said.  </p>
<p>TI confirmed that 42.2 million shares, 8.86 percent of the total, had been sold to institutional investors by brokerages UBS, Cazenove and SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>Mannesmann shares were up 3.20 marks at 586.00 by 0958 GMT.</p>
