<p>Greek workers crippled transport, schools, hospitals and public services with a 24-hour strike on Thursday to protest against the ruling socialists' tough new budget due to be presented in parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>Government and union officials said the strike disrupted air, sea, train and urban transport. No buses or trolleys and only a few taxis appeared in Athens while government ministries were working with reduced staffs.</p>
<p>The General Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE), the largest public and private sector grouping, said that 70 to 100 percent of its members took part in the strike which it called to protest against the government's 1997 austerity budget.</p>
<p>Government officials put the figure lower saying there was little sign of private sector workers joining in the strike.</p>
<p>Farmers, demanding higher price supports and fuel subsidies, blocked the main north-south highway with 2,000 tractors, halting traffic between Athens and second city, Salonika.</p>
<p>The farmers' road blockade was gaining momentum and farmer representatives said they might extend road blocks until Friday.</p>
<p>National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou has said the budget would be the toughest in 15 years as Greece struggles to get its economy in line with its European Union partners.</p>
<p>Papandoniou and Prime Minister Costas Simitis have said their priority is to join European economic and monetary union (EMU) by 2001, two years after the main core of EU states plans to launch the Euro single European currency.</p>
<p>Papandoniou has vowed to tax the wealthy hard but he has rejected numerous requests from organised labour to ease the economic hardship of lower salaried workers.</p>
<p>&quot;This governement feels for the problems of the workers, and especially the weaker social strata and asks for understanding,&quot; a government statement said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But it said following the austerity plan and maintaining a strong drachma policy to fight inflation were the best ways to support the real income of wage earners, pensioners and farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;The new taxes in the 1997 budget will fall exclusively on higher incomes,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The strike was also joined by members of the ADEDY civil servants union.</p>
<p>Workers at state-run Olympic Airways staged a three-hour stoppage in the morning, delaying international and domestic flights. Civil aviation employees, except traffic controllers, have called for a three-hour stoppage in the evening.</p>
<p>Some 8,000 to 10,000 workers marched through Athens to the economy ministry to demand the budget be changed before parliament votes on it next month. Similar marches were held in other cities, including Salonika and western port Patras.</p>
