<title>SINGAPORE: No recovery yet for Singapore hotel sector-analyst.</title>

<p>The bustling crowd along Singapore's main shopping belt belies the difficulties hoteliers are facing -- rising costs, room oversupply and falling visitor arrivals, a Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (Singapore) report said.</p>
<p>The research house in its June report recommended investors to underweight the hotel sector, expected to consolidate over the next three years and to under-perform.</p>
<p>Weak demand growth over the next three years, price pressure from an oversupply of rooms and slimmer profit margins due to increase cost pressures were factors cited.</p>
<p>The sector was projected to recover only in 1999 when demand catches up with supply, its said.</p>
<p>Deutsche's analyst Sandeep Mahawar said Singapore remains a major tourist destination in Asia but faces keen competition from its neighbours, especially Hong Kong and Thailand.</p>
<p>The intense regional competition is exacerbated by rising labour costs, the largest cost component of a hotel operation.</p>
<p>Mahawar said wages have risen faster than productivity over the last three years.</p>
<p>&quot;We further expect labour earnings to grow by five percent and productivity to increase by only 1.5 percent in 1997. This trend will continue to put pressure on hotels' profitability,&quot; Mahawar said.</p>
<p>Hotels here are also plagued by an oversupply of rooms.</p>
<p>Room supply is expected to increase an average five percent annually over the next three years overtaking the projected four percent demand growth over the same period.</p>
<p>As a result, the average hotel occupancy rate is expected to fall further by three percent to 79.8 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>A slow down in visitor arrival, coupled with a strong local currency, saw Singapore's visitor arrival growth rate dip to a five year low of 2.1 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Mahawar said the Singapore dollar, which has appreciated by 15 percent against the greenback since 1992 and by 16 percent against the Japanese yen since 1994, has eroded much of Singapore's attractiveness as a holiday destination and &quot;shoppers paradise&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Singapore has lost its competitive edge relative to its neighbours which offer similar products at lower prices,&quot; Mahawar said.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong Singapore dollar will prevent robust growth in visitor arrivals. For 1997, we forecast visitor arrivals to grow by only three percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the dismal sectoral outlook, Mahawar had a buy recommendation on Singapore-listed Hotel Properties Ltd and Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd due to their property linkages and redevelopment potential.</p>
