<p>Attorneys for Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh are considering asking for a change of venue or a delay in the trial following two published reports that claimed McVeigh admitted planting the bomb, a member of the defence team said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are preparing for all possibilities,&quot; Ann Bradley told Reuters.</p>
<p>When asked if the possibilities included seeking a change of venue or a delay in the scheduled March 31 start of the trial, she said &quot;both are possibilities.&quot; However, no final decisions have been made.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Playboy Magazine published on the Internet an article that it said corroborated a Dallas Morning News report that McVeigh admitted planting the April 19, 1995, bomb of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>McVeigh's lead attorney Stephen Jones complained about the reports, coming so close to the beginning of the trial.</p>
<p>Jones considered seeking a delay when the Dallas Morning News report was published initially via the Internet on Feb. 28, but after a meeting with the judge several days later said he had decided not to ask for a continuance.</p>
<p>This week's report in Playboy reignited speculation that Jones would seek a delay.</p>
<p>A Justice Department source said if a continuance were sought the government would be expected to oppose the motion.</p>
<p>When the court sent out 1,000 notices to prospective jurors it directed them to avoid reading or hearing stories about the case.</p>
<p>In an interview with CBS News on Thursday Jones strongly denied he played any role in leaking the documents and said such publication hurts the trial.</p>
<p>&quot;It has wrecked this trial. Forever there will be a question mark over these proceedings. What has been done the last two weeks is as wrong for the justice system and the first amendment as the killing of the people in Oklahoma City was for their families,&quot; Jones told CBS.</p>
<p>Jones also denied that the defence team had lost control of its documents, saying &quot;no one is 100 percent safe from a thief.&quot;</p>
<p>Both the Dallas Morning News and Playboy said they obtained the documents legally.</p>
<p>The Playboy story described in detail the contents of the truck bomb, including &quot;80 or more 50-pound bags of fertiliser and 55-gallon barrels of nitromethane racing fuel&quot; and the timed detonators that McVeigh said were used to explode it.</p>
<p>It said he jogged from the scene before the bomb went off, but was still close enough to be thrown up against a wall by the blast.</p>
<p>The Dallas paper story quoted confidential defence documents that Jones said were made up as a ploy to flush out a witness suspected of involvement in the bombing. He accused the newspaper of stealing the documents, a charge the Morning News denied.</p>
<p>The Playboy article said it believed its documents are different from those reported in the Dallas paper, &quot;yet they appear to corroborate basic facts in the News story.&quot;</p>
<p>If Jones does seek a change of venue it would be for the second time. The trial was moved to Denver from Oklahoma because U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsh decided it was impossible for McVeigh or co-defendant Terry Nichols to receive a fair trial anywhere in the state.</p>
<p>The two will be tried separately. Nichols' trial date has not been set.</p>
