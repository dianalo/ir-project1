<title>CANADA: Toronto stock exchange trading floor closes.</title>
<headline>Toronto stock exchange trading floor closes.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-04-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's closing bell sounded for the last time on Wednesday as the exchange closed its 30,000-square foot trading floor and switched to computerized trading.</p>
<p>Ted England, head trader with Peters &amp; Co Ltd made the ceremonial last floor trade, buying 100 shares of Bell Canada Enterprises Inc from Donny Moss, a trader with RBC Dominion Securities.</p>
<p>Bell Canada, which began trading in 1905, is one of the oldest stocks listed on the exchange and was the first to trade on the new floor when the Toronto bourse expanded to its present location in 1983.  </p>
<p>Closing the trading floor will save the TSE about C$4 million a year in real estate costs and result in efficiency gains, TSE Chief Executive Rowland Fleming said.</p>
<p>&quot;To compete in the world arena, we must change and that is what we are doing today. We are witnessing a rite of passage that marks the beginning of a new era for the exchange and for Canada,&quot; Fleming told the assembled traders, dignitaries and media who crowded the floor for the last trade.</p>
<p>The TSE, founded in 1861, is the world's seventh largest equities exchange, and the biggest in North America to relinquish its floor.  </p>
<p>The migration of stocks from the floor to Toronto's Computer Assisted Trading System (CATS) began earlier this year and only a handful of traders remained on the floor in the last days before Wednesday's bell, down from a peak of 400 during the floor's heyday in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>They will join the majority of equity traders in Toronto who already work from their brokerage desks.</p>
<p>By the end of 1997, trading will all be on a system purchased from the Paris Bourse. An average of 37,000 trades a day are currently split between the new system, called Torex, and the 20-year-old CATS system.</p>
<p>Other floorless bourses include London, Sydney, Paris and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The TSE will spend about C$4-million converting the trading floor, which sits on prime real estate in Toronto's financial district, to office space.</p>
