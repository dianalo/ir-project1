<p>Swiss veteran Tony Rominger, who crashed out of what was to be his last Tour de France in Tuesday's third stage, will have an operation on a double fracture of his collarbone in Switzerland, his French team Cofidis said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rominger was injured in a mass pile-up some 10 kms from the end of Tuesday's stage from Vire to Plumelec in Britanny and was taken to hospital in nearby Vannes.</p>
<p>He was transferred to Salpetriere hospital in Paris early on Wednesday and was told he would require surgery.</p>
<p>Rominger, 36, winner of the Spanish Vuelta three times and the Giro d'Italia once, asked to be allowed to have the operation in his home country close to his family.</p>
<p>He was driven to Basle by road, arriving on Wednesday late afternoon at Bruderholz hospital where he was due to undergo surgery later in the day.</p>
