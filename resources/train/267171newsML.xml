<p>Blue-chip stocks romped ahead for the third session in a row Thursday amid strength in bonds and gains in the shares of banks and technology companies.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones index was up 67.66 points at 6,414.43 after jumping a total of nearly 80 points on Wednesday and Tuesday. This week's gains come after a recent sell-off that wiped out more than 200 points from the Dow.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 2-1 on active volume of 283 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq index was up 8.46 points at 1,293.84. The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.03 to 576.99.</p>
<p>The action shifted back to blue chips as investors felt encouraged by General Electric Co.'s plan to boost its quarterly dividend as well as increase its stock repurchase programme and split its common stock two-for one.</p>
<p>GE was one of the prime movers of the Dow industrials, rising 2 to 101.</p>
<p>&quot;The action is in the blue chips after the General Electric announcement,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. &quot;Yesterday was a big day for Nasdaq, but Nasdaq stocks are still doing okay overall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The high techs are following up on their rally from yesterday as are the biotechs. Banks are up because rates are stable,&quot; Bleier said. &quot;It seems that all is well with the world after a brief but volatile pause.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32, lowering its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 6.66 percent from 6.70 percent at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Among the big gainers, Intel Corp. was up 2-7/8 at 138-5/8 and Microsoft Corp. rose 2-1/8 at 84-3/4.</p>
<p>In the banking sector, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. was up 1-3/4 at 97-5/8, Chase Manhattan Corp. was up 2-1/4 at 89-1/2, Citicorp was up 2 at 103 and BankAmerica Corp. rose 1-3/4 at 100-1/8.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Micro Warehouse Inc. lost 7-9/16 at 12-7/16 after the company said it expected fourth quarter profits to fall sharply below analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>General Motors was off 7/8 at 53-5/8. Analysts briefed by the company on Wednesday said GM expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be below industry analysts' expectations due to higher incentives and advertising costs for new products.</p>
