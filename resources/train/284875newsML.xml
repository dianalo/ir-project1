<headline>Bombay shares end lower, correction after rally.</headline>
<dateline>BOMBAY 1997-01-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares fell broadly on Thursday at Bombay bourses as market players turned cautious, selectively booked profits and moved to the sidelines, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be comfortable at creating long positions at these levels,&quot; said Maulik Sharedalal at brokerage Maulik Girish. &quot;I would rather wait for a correction.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said the market lacked follow-up support after prices soared on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index dropped 32.06 points, or 0.98 percent, to a provisional 3,228.50 -- after vaulting 175.36 points, or 5.68 percent, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 50-stock National Stock Exchange (NSE) index shed 12.95 points, or 1.38 percent, to 926.60 and the 500-share CRISIL index fell 0.86 points to 625.86, both provisional closings.</p>
<p>Analysts said Wednesday's rally was triggered by expectations and some positive statements by the Indian government, but other economic news was disheartening.</p>
<p>&quot;Export figures are down, inflation is rising,&quot; said Sharedalal. &quot;This market cannot sustain a rally on statements alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said some domestic funds were sellers at higher levels, both on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>They said foreign funds were mostly inactive but watchful.</p>
<p>&quot;A minor trigger can bring this market down,&quot; said one dealer at a foreign broking firm. &quot;The rally was solely driven by speculative purchases.&quot;</p>
<p>Bajaj Auto dropped 26.25 rupees to 894, ACC 45.25 to 1,275, BSES 12.0 to 215.75, SBI 6.0 to 240.50, TELCO 5.50 to 356.50, Indian Hotel 13.75 to 718, Hindustan Lever 7.0 to 810, Reliance 4.75 to 213.25 and TISCO 2.75 to 179.50.</p>
<p>Ranbaxy firmed 10.0 to 592.50, Hindalco 5.0 to 673.75, Grasim 3.75 to 425 and SAIL 1.0 to 22.25.</p>
