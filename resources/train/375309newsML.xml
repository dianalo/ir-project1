<headline>Mexico peso closes mixed on pre-weekend swaps.</headline>

<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed slightly weaker on Thursday after closing firmer for five straight sessions, due to swaps ahead of the weekend, traders said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, traders said the peso shrugged off adverse circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso still closed stronger than 7.80 per dollar, despite swaps and lack of dollar inflow,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso closed 0.7 of a centavo weaker at 7.7940/7.7960 per dollar, while its 24-hour stablemate was unchnaged at 7.7810/7.7830 per dollar.  </p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts closed earlier 1.3 centavos firmer at 7.7740/7.7770 per dollar.</p>
<p>Dealers said 48-hour contracts were in heavy demand as they do not have to be settled until Tuesday because U.S. markets will be closed on Monday, February 17, for President's Day.</p>
<p>The advantage, they said, was that dollars could be sold in the same-day market and bought back at 48 hours, with pesos that may be invested in the money market for five days.</p>
<p>Traders differed as to whether or not the peso had scope to gain ground against the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel there are more and more domestic players short on dollars who will not be able to hold out for long without squaring positions,&quot; a trader said. &quot;It will be enough for one player to step in to buy dollars for the rest to follow suit.&quot;</p>
<p>Other traders felt the peso could head for resistance at 7.77 per dollar before receding to 7.80.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso did not firm up today because they took profits on the bourse, but when the rally gets under way again then the peso could gain ground,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they would keep a close eye on reaction in the U.S. bond markets to Producer Price Index data due to be announced in early trade on Friday.</p>
