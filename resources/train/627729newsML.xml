<title>UK: Mark bolstered as French election looms.</title>

<p>The mark hovered at the upper end of its trading range on its European crosses, amid nervousness about the French elections and a row between the Bundesbank and the German government.</p>
<p>Traders see the mark supported against the franc before the second round of parliamentary elections in France on Friday, which the opposition Socialist party is expected to win.</p>
<p>Still, the Bundesbank's opposition to Bonn's plan to revalue its assets capped mark gains. The scheme is viewed as a bid to ensure Germany qualifies for the single currency from the outset and makes the inclusion of Italy and Spain in EMU more likely, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets aren't moving too much because of the increased uncertainty about what is going to happen with EMU,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, the chief analyst at IBJ International. &quot;We've got the French elections coming up and the debate in Germany is set to intensify.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark/Paris was last 3.3800/05 at from 3.3804/09 late Thursday in Europe.</p>
<p>Traders said rumours of private polls indicating the opposition Socialist party are extending their lead over the right-wing coalition were bound to undermine the franc.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters do not, however, expect the franc to weaken any further than 3.40 per mark if the Socialists win the elections. They are looking for it to rally to 3.3620 per mark if the right pull off an unexpected victory.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is pretty much prepared for a left-wing victory now, which was their worst case scenario before,&quot; said a trader at a Japanese bank in London.</p>
<p>Either way, traders expect the new French government to be less committed to tightening fiscal policy, and to push for a broad group of countries to launch the single currency.</p>
<p>Philippe Seguin, tipped as the next prime minister if the right win the elections, yesterday called for France to found EMU with &quot;the largest possible number of partners,&quot; including Italy, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
<p>The lira was undermined after a report showed Italian gross domestic product unexpectedly fell 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 1997 from the fourth quarter. Weaker-than-expected growth this year will make it harder for the government to raise the taxes it needs to meet the EMU criteria.</p>
<p>The Italian currency is expected by traders to take its cue from whether the Italian cabinet later today approves a three-year economic plan, which will outline how the government intends to meet the Maastricht EMU convergence criteria.</p>
<p>Mark/lira was quoted at 994.50/6.00 from 991.90/2.20 yesterday. --Swaha Pattanaik, London Forex Desk +44 171 542 6284</p>
