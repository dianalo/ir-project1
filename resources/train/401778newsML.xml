<p>Dutch petrochemicals group DSM NV said on Tuesday it would pay a higher dividend despite reporting a 32.7 percent drop in 1996 earnings.</p>
<p>DSM said its 1996 net profit fell to 720 million guilders from 1.07 billion in 1995, with fourth quarter net profit falling to 129 million guilders from 144 million.</p>
<p>But DSM said it was raising its dividend for ordinary shareholders to nine guilders per share from eight in 1995.</p>
<p>Earnings for the first half of 1997 would be comparable to those in the same period of 1996, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the markets that are important to DSM demand continues to develop favourably. As far as can be judged at present, margins, in particular those for polymers, will gradually improve,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on this, DSM expects that the results for the first half of 1997 will reach a level comparable to that of the first half of 1996,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>DSM said full-year 1996 operating profits had been pressured due to lower margins for hydrocarbons and polymers and for the industrial chemicals caprolactam and acrylonitrile.</p>
<p>Analysts said that while overall earnings were in line with an indicative figure issued by DSM in January, the core hydrocarbons and polymers business did better than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures were above expectations, notably due to a better than expected performance of the hydrocarbons/polymers division. The rise in oil prices did not pressure results as much as expected,&quot; Peter Schouten of MeesPierson said.</p>
<p>Nils van Elzelingen of NIBStrating said prior to the results he had expected slightly lower profits in 1997 but that he had now revised this to a slight increase.</p>
<p>&quot;Earnings from hydrocarbons and polymers were above my expectations...That will have a positive follow-through effect in 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>DSM said that in future it would offer shareholders the opportunity of receiving their dividend in shares, buying back shares in the market for this purpose.</p>
<p>Analysts welcomed this, saying it would give additional support to DSM's share price which was up 4.50 guilders at 189.50 by 1125 GMT.</p>
