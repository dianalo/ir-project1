<p>Cambodia's exiled Prince Norodom Sirivudh has arrived back in France after abandoning a bid to fly home to contest charges that he plotted to kill Cambodian Co-Premier Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Sirivudh flew to Hong Kong on Monday but airlines banned him from flying on to Phnom Penh after Cambodia said he would be arrested on arrival. He left Hong Kong for Europe on a Lufthansa flight and arrived at Paris's Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport late on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm disappointed because I'm Cambodian and it's not normal that a Cambodian airline, Royal Air Cambodge, starts making concessions to leaders talking about shooting down a plane,&quot; the prince told reporters on arrival.</p>
<p>&quot;I will continue to fight to go back to my country. The only thing I ask is to be put on trial,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A half-brother of King Sihanouk and a former foreign minister, Sirivudh went into exile in France in December 1995 after being held for a month on charges of involvement in an alleged plot to kill Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Hun Sen, who rules in an uneasy coalition with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Sirivudh's nephew Norodom Ranariddh, has refused to back calls for an amnesty and warned last week of violence if the prince returned. He said last December he would shoot down any plane carrying Sirivudh.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still confident, I think we must continue the struggle. One should not give in to such pressure,&quot; Sirivudh said.</p>
<p>Sirivudh had said in Hong Kong he did not think he would be killed when he arrived in Cambodia.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe in our institutions. We have a monarchy, we have a king, we have a national assembly, we have a royal government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Fearing for passenger safety, Hong Kong's Dragonair refused to allow Sirivudh on its flight to Phnom Penh on Tuesday, and Royal Air Cambodge also barred him from flying.</p>
<p>Sirivudh, who told a French magazine recently he could no longer afford to live in Paris, has said Ranariddh and FUNCINPEC supported his return to Cambodia.</p>
<p>Sirivudh's sister Norodom Vacheara told Reuters that he wanted a special commission of Cambodia's National Assembly to request the trial be reviewed, and she could not understand why FUNCINPEC had not requested that such a commision be set up.</p>
<p>&quot;Do they really want him to return? Does my brother also bother FUNCINPEC leaders? That's the big question I am asking myself,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She said he would stay in Paris for a few days, then go to another undisclosed destination to keep campaigning to clear his name.</p>
<p>Before his return to Paris was confirmed, a source close to the case had told Reuters in Hong Kong that Sirivudh was trying to head for Beijing and had been in contact with Chinese officials to work out travel arrangements.</p>
<p>There had been unconfirmed rumours that he would meet Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing.</p>
