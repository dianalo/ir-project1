<p>The prospects of seeing any tennis at the Wimbledon championships looked gloomy on Friday as rain continued to pour down on the All England Club.</p>
<p>The start of play was put back indefinitely because of the rain, which washed out Thursday's programme altogether.</p>
<p>Organisers said they still hoped to get some matches on court later on Friday when drier periods are predicted. But forecasters warned that rain would never be far away.</p>
<p>Only once before in Wimbledon's 111-year history have two successive days been entirely lost to rain. That was in 1909.</p>
<p>Thursday was the first complete day since the 1992 championships to be washed out completely. Wednesday saw only two matches completed.</p>
<p>Rain has spoiled all but one of the first five days of the Grand Slam tournament, leaving organisers more than 120 matches behind schedule in what weather experts say could be the wettest June this century in England.</p>
<p>Tournament referee Alan Mills said on Thursday that officials would consider emergency measures such as extending the tournament into a third week, reducing some rounds of the men's singles to the best of three sets or playing on the middle Sunday, traditionally a rest day.</p>
<p>The men's doubles competition, which has yet to get underway, has already been reduced to the best of three sets for the first three rounds.</p>
<p>Natasha Zvereva of Belarus and Elena Likhovtseva of Russia were due out first on Centre Court in a bid to complete their first-round match which started on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Court One, if the rain stops, will see the eagerly-awaited Wimbledon debut of American teenager Venus Williams, touted as the next big name in tennis. She plays Pole Magdalena Grzybowska.</p>
