<p>The Southeast Asian rubber market may get a slight lift on news of an end to a strike at U.S. tyre-maker Goodyear Tire, but poor consumer offtake will cap any gains, regional traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>A report on Friday that the Thai government had bowed to pressure from rubber tappers and raised its market intervention price to 29 baht a kg from 27.50 baht may also give a temporary boost to prices, they added.  </p>
<p>&quot;Goodyear might have a bit of an impact. This, along with the Thai news, could give the market a slight bounce,&quot; a senior trader with a commodity company in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the overall situation is still fairly grim,&quot; he said, adding a rise in production with the end of the wintering period, when latex flow slows as trees shed their leaves, could send prices sliding south again.</p>
<p>Another dealer with a foreign brokerage house said the news would be ignored by a market already weighed down by holidays in Japan and Thailand on Monday and poor consumer buying.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think Goodyear will have that much of an impact. Basically, we need orders to pour in. If there are no orders, the price won't inch up,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The nearly three-week long Goodyear strike ended on Saturday after the United Steelworkers of America reached a new six-year labour deal with the company.</p>
<p>In Thailand, traders slammed the decision of the government to intervene in the market again after a protest by rubber tappers in the south of the country.  </p>
<p>&quot;It seemed like this government succumbs to the demands of any mob whose number exceeds 1,000,&quot; a dealer in the Thai rubber centre of Hat Yai said.</p>
<p>&quot;But what the government did distorted the market. World prices are bearish. We will have difficulties meeting obligations now that the local prices are high,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Thai government has bought about 45,000 tonnes of RSS3 rubber from the local market since March to prop up prices and said it intends to buy more.</p>
<p>The Thai benchmark RSS3 was indicated at 108.50 U.S. cents a kg FOB Bangkok on Friday against 106.00 cents the previous week.  </p>
<p>In Indonesia, the strike at Goodyear had dampened market sentiment and driven prices for SIR20 grade rubber down.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike in Goodyear has, for instance, affected the contracts for May shipment. Those contracts have had to be suspended pending further developments,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Prices could fall to as low as 45.00 U.S. cents a lb over the next few weeks because of the prolonged poor demand, Indonesian traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect prices will at least stay the same this week, but the chance for prices to fall is quite high due to poor market sentiment,&quot; one said.  </p>
<p>Traders said SIR20 offer prices were quoted at 46.50 U.S. cents a lb FOB Palembang for July shipment. Offer prices were unchanged at 46.50 cents FOB Medan, at 46.50 cents FOB Padang and Surabaya and at 46.00 cents FOB Pontianak. Offer prices in Jambi were unchanged at 45.75 cents.</p>
<p>Malaysian traders said prices should consolidate further, but the lack of demand continues to weigh on sentiment.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no sales, no leads,&quot; said a trader, referring to Friday's trade. &quot;I don't see anything changing this week.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board (MRELB) quoted the benchmark RSS1 at the close of the market last week at 276 Malaysian cents a kg, down 1.50 cents from the previous week. Prices are seen falling an average 3-5 cents this week.</p>
<p>The SMR20 for May buyer fell four cents from the previous week at 259.50 cents a kg. Traders offered SMR 20 at 258 cents a kg, SMR CV at 331 cents, SMR L at 309 cents, SMR 5 at 256 cents, SMR 10 at 269 cents and drum latex at 227 cents.</p>
<p>The supply of latex was steady and looked certain to build stocks further and put pressure on raw material prices, the traders said.  </p>
