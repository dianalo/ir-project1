<title>UK: Prompt Brent slides under $22 on weaker gas oil.</title>
<headline>Prompt Brent slides under $22 on weaker gas oil.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Weaker IPE gas oil futures on Thursday pulled prompt Brent crude futures below the psychologically important $22 a barrel level for the first time in over four months, traders said.</p>
<p>The dip at 1455 GMT followed a fall by the front month Feburary gas oil contract below key resistance at $195.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>Some traders said fresh fund selling just before Brent's dip gave impetus to its decline, which met resisance at 21.65/75 before recovering to $21.80 at 1517 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Weve had some weakness in gas oil. But I wouldn't over analyse this and I wouldn't call it a break -- the volume is far too little,&quot; one trader said. &quot;No one really knows what's going on other than the market looks weak.&quot;</p>
<p>Prompt futures have not fallen below $22 since September 23, 1996, when they traded at a low of $21.83, although the front-month touched $22 on December 11 and January 27.</p>
<p>February gas oil was $9.5 off at $191.50 at 1515 GMT. Traders attributed gas oil's fall to technical weakness and plays on the Feb/March gas oil spread.</p>
<p>&quot;Feb's was pulled lower by spread play and once it fell through that 195.50 it pulled Brent down with it,&quot; one trader said. The Feb/March spread stood at $4.25 against $7.0 at Wednesday's close.</p>
