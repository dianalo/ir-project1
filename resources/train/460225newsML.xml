<p>Nine-year-old Miranda Malamed never got her milkshake.</p>
<p>Wounded in the foot in Friday's explosion in a crowded Tel Aviv cafe, she had to settle for a doughnut instead in a bed in the children's ward of Ichilov hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an explosion because they started to build at Har Homa,&quot; Miranda said in a calm, steady voice when asked why she thought a Moslem suicide bomber blew himself up on the Jewish costume festival of Purim.</p>
<p>The blast came amid heightened Israeli-Palestinian tension over the groundbreaking on Tuesday of a Jewish settlement, called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic, in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Miranda was dressed as pony-tailed Pipi Longstocking when she and her mother decided to stop at the Apropos cafe on the way home from school, just 20 metres (yards) from the scene of the explosion.</p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly I heard a boom and everything was grey and all sorts of things fell on the floor and people began to scream. We ordered but we didn't have time to get it. I wanted to have a milkshake,&quot; Miranda said, holding a chocolate-glazed doughnut.</p>
<p>&quot;I started to run and I saw cars whose windows had been blown out. I put my hand on my leg and I saw my whole hand was covered with blood.&quot;</p>
<p>Miranda's father, himself a physician, said doctors had stitched the wound and she would be fine. But her mother was in surgery and her condition was not immediately known.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the Arabs truly want peace and there are those who don't and they're the ones who carry out all these attacks,&quot; Miranda said from her bed surrounded by stuffed animals.</p>
