<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended broadly higher and towards the top of the day's range on Monday, bolstered by a mixture of speculative and commercial buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>Spot September cocoa rose $15 per tonne on the day, to $1,496, after ranging between $1,500 and $1,475. Most-active December also closed $15 higher, to $1,536, after ranging from $1,538 to $1,515. The back months ended up $15 to $18.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices dipped briefly into negative territory in the morning, pressured by light speculative long liquidation, traders said. But a lack of follow-through to the downside and a some industry-related buying of July 1998 contracts helped turn the market around.</p>
<p>&quot;About 300 to 400 Julys traded to $1,606,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said much of the day's activity was centered on the nearby September/December switch as market participants continue to focus on adjusting their positions ahead of the September contract's first notice day on August 18.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the volume was switches,&quot; said one trader. &quot;September rollover was the emphasis today.&quot;</p>
<p>Technically, some traders were encouraged by today's finish toward the highs. &quot;We've seen higher highs and higher lows,&quot; said another trader. &quot;It is constructive technically.&quot;</p>
<p>On the charts, traders said December still faced some resistance at $1,538, followed by $1,548-$1,550. On the downside, support was seen near $1,526-$1,528, with the subsequent levels put at $1,518 and $1,510.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Nigeria's cocoa association expects a rise in this year's crop of between 10 and 20 percent from last year when around 140,000 tonnes of beans were exported, the national news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>According to official data from the Federal Produce Inspection Agency, cumulative exports for the first eight months of the 1996/97 year totalled 126,324 tonnes, against 112,644 tonnes exported by the end of May 1996.</p>
<p>Turnover reached an estimated 10,463 lots.</p>
