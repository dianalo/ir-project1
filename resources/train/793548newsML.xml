<p>Forces loyal to Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov on Tuesday shelled positions south of the capital Dushanbe held by rebel Colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev.</p>
<p>A Reuter correspondent in the village of Kirov, about 18 km (12 miles) of Dushanbe, saw Rakhmonov's presidential guard unleash clutches of Grad rockets every few minutes. Pro-government troops said Khudoyberdyev's men were returning fire with mortars.  </p>
<p>&quot;We exchanged some fire earlier today but we began rocketing their positions at about 3.30 p.m. (1030 GMT),&quot; said a government commander at a post about 14 km (nine miles) south of Dushanbe.</p>
<p>The commander of an elite government armoured brigade who has mutinied on two previous occasions, Khudoyberdyev moved his armour towards Dushanbe at the weekend in the wake of heavy fighting between two rival warlords in the Tajik capital.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Khudoyberdyev told Reuters by telephone that government aircraft had bombed the town of Kalininabad, near his headquarters about 120 km (80 miles) south of Dushanbe. On Sunday, Rakhmonov issued a three-day ultimatum to the rebel colonel to lay down his arms or face &quot;destruction&quot;.</p>
<p>The outbreak of fighting has no link to the former Soviet republic's armed Islamic opposition with whom the government signed a peace accord in June aimed at putting an end to a four-year civil war.</p>
