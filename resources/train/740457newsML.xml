<p>Former Australian Labor minister and current opposition frontbencher Peter Baldwin on Friday said he would quit parliament.</p>

<p>Baldwin, 46, has been in the national parliament for 15 years, including six as a minister, and was a member of New South Wales state's upper house for seven years.</p>
<p>He was higher education and employment services minister and later social security minister under the former Labor government, which was dumped from power in March 1996.</p>
