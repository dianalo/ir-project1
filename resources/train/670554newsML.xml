<headline>Late NYMEX Hub natgas mostly holds gains with cash.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-18</dateline>

<p>Most NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures held modest gains late Wednesday in sluggish activity, with reports of firmer physical prices lifting the fronts though the market remained stuck in a technical range.</p>
<p>At 1430 EDT, July was still up by 1.7 cents at $2.176 per million British thermal units, while August was 2.5 cents higher at $2.195. Others remained mixed, with some 1998s down.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been stuck in a range for a while, but the weather next week is slightly constructive and it gives me reason to think there's a little room to the upside,&quot; said one Texas-based trader.  </p>
<p>He said some forecasters were now looking for warmer temperatures next week in eastern and southern states, a factor that should support the cash ahead of bidweek late next week, particularly if the West stays hot.</p>
<p>But he said he expected July to run out of steam in the mid-$2.20s without a broader, more sustained heat wave.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll showed most expected an 85-95 bcf weekly stock build when the AGA report is released later today. For the same week last year, stocks rose by 87 bcf.</p>
<p>Technically, traders still saw July resistance at $2.21, $2.25 and $2.37. Support remained at $2.055 and $2.</p>
<p>In the cash, Louisiana Gulf Coast gas firmed Wednesday by two to three cents to about the $2.20 area. Midcon pipes were talked up slightly at about $2.05. New York city gate gas sold at $2.45, also about two cents higher.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 8,144 contracts traded at 1115 EDT.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, July climbed three cents to $2.05, while deferreds were steady to 2.5 cents higher. The East/West spread narrowed by 1.3 cents to 12.6 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
