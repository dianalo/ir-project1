<p>A healthy turnover of fixtures in the dry cargo market was not enough to convince many observers that the general trend continued to be anything other than gradual decline in a number of key trades.</p>
<p>Brokers said the relatively weak volume of grain chartering enquiry from the Mississippi and problems arising from the grounding of Chemtrans Belocean at South West Pass have been cited as significant negative factors.</p>
<p>The BFI declined 13 points to 1493, falling below 1500 for the first time since 19th March and recording its largest single fall for nearly a month.</p>
<p>GRAIN - There was a notable absence of activity in the Atlantic grain trades, both of fixtures concluded and of new chartering enquiry.</p>
<p>One grain house broker said that unless fresh demand from Argentina and Brazil was seen this week the market must continue to soften since the potential demand from the US Gulf was not considered sufficien to sustain current levels.</p>
<p>One of the few grain fixtures reported was the Seatrans relet Ermis 64,379 dwt to HMM delivery US Gulf mid April for US Gulf/Japan heavy grain at $13,950 daily plus $295,000 bonus.</p>
<p>Iranian charterers Irisl fixed Ioannis Zafirakis 64,900 dwt delivery spot Shanghai for a trip via Australia and Iran redelivery Muscat at $11,100 daily. Irisl also fixed Minoan Flame 64,000 dwt delivery prompt China for a similar trip at $10,750 daily but brokers believed this business failed on subjects.</p>
<p>Few handy-size fixtures surfaced although rumours indicated that Comshipco booked Nereis P for 20,000 pellets 54' Sao Francisco do Sul/Brake for mid April at between $22.00 and $23.00.</p>
<p>Andre were said to have covered a handysize vessel from S.Australia to Mombasa on private terms. Andre quoted one of the very few new enquiries, 10,000 wheat Caen/Cartagena (Spain) for spot loading.</p>
<p>MINERALS - Caper rates were a little weaker generally although brokers said there was more Japanese enquiry in the market.</p>
<p>Ostrako was believed to have been booked by Bocimar for 115,000 coal from Prodeco or La Cienaga to Rotterdam at over $5.80, Pawnee 122,000 dwt open prompt Gijon was rumoured fixed for transatlantic business, and Cape Cathay 149,000 dwt was believed covered on subjects from UK early May for a trip to the Far East.</p>
<p>Bulktirreno 145,000 dwt which was reported fixed on subjects by Pan Ocean for Richards Bay coal to S.Korea was said to have now failed and been replaced by Francois L.D. 145,229 dwt, but further details were lacking.</p>
<p>Mount Isa's fixture of the relet Anangel Pride for 150,000 coal Abbot Point/Rotterdam and Antwerp for 1/15 May at $10.50 basis 1-2 was regarded by brokers as a weaker level.</p>
<p>A number of panamaxes such as Mass Merit 69,620 dwt, Solidarnosc 73,470 dwt and Stone Topaz 65,029 dwt were understood fixed from the Pacific into the Atlantic on private terms.</p>
<p>Anthia 81,000 dwt was believed fixed by Kingston Maritime for ironore from Tubarao to Lazaro Cardenas, and Helen B 70,537 dwt was said to be on subjects for coal from US Gulf to Cigading, but further details were lacking.</p>
