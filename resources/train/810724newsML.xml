<p>Three sons of Tajikistan's chief Moslem cleric have been kidnapped by an armed band in another sign of chronic instability in the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>&quot;Around 20 masked armed men broke into the house of mufti Amunullo Negmatzoda, disarmed his guards and kidnapped his two sons, aged 15 and 25. Negmatzoda was away at this time,&quot; a local police official told Reuters by telephone late on Friday.</p>
<p>Later, a Tajik interior ministry source said a third son, 29-year-old Dzhaloleddin, was also kidnapped but from another house nearby.</p>
<p>Officials said the incident had taken place in the village of Daryabad, some five km (three miles) south-east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe. They said one of Tajikistan's rogue armed bands could be responsible.</p>
<p>Tajikistan's secular government and the united Islamist opposition signed a final peace agreement on June 27 in Moscow, ending four years of civil war which killed tens of thousands of people and made many others refugees.</p>
<p>But the shaky peace is often disturbed by maverick bands competing for influence in the Central Asian state of 5.7 million people, which borders Afghanistan and China.</p>
