<p>Greek equities ended down 0.51 percent on profit-taking and fund managers said they expected the bourse to stabilise in the next few sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is making a pause. This is natural, if one takes into account the fact that Wednesday's high, at 1,446.82, approached end-February's previous high of 1,453.60 points,&quot; said George Vendouratos, fund manager at Aspis Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>Some investors are getting nervous with the general index close to February's previous high, said Vendouratos.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors will wait-to-see what happens for a few days. Some profit taking will take place and the market will probably stabilise by the end of this week,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But all macroeconomic figures are positive and encouraging and will soon push the general share index up again, he added.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed 0.51 percent or 7.27 points lower at 1,429.28 from Tuesday's 1,436.55 close, after opening at 1,436.61. The session's high was at 1,446.82 and its low at 1,425.91 points.</p>
