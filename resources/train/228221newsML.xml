<p>Brazil's corporate debt levels rose 39 percent in the first three quarters of 1996 against the same period last year as firms rushed to finance plant expansion to improve competitiveness, a private survey showed.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in corporate debt levels is healthy for Brazilian companies because these funds were used to invest in production and not cover deficits,&quot; said Jorge Kotani, of the Lafis consultancy firm which sponsored the survey.</p>
<p>According to the study, which surveyed 30 Brazilian companies in several sectors, corporate indebtness as a share of the net worth rose to 51.59 percent in the first nine months of the year from 37.1 percent in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Debt levels are expected to continue growing in 1997, although Brazil's political outlook are likely to weigh on management's decision whether or not to invest, Kotani said.</p>
<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who in 1994 was elected to a four-year term, is seeking a constitutional amendment which would allow him to seek a second term in office.</p>
<p>Kotani said Brazilian companies have also improved their margins due to reestructuring. He said gross margins between January and September jumped to 47.72 percent of total sales against 22.03 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Nine-month net margins doubled to 4.62 percent from 2.1 percent a year earlier, he said.</p>
