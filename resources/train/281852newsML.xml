<p>A Yemeni official and Poland's ambassador to Sanaa said on Tuesday they hoped five Polish tourists being held by tribesmen would soon be freed but that the hostages had not yet been released.</p>
<p>&quot;Negotiations are still underway, the government is not sparing any efforts to end the situation, and we hope for a solution soon,&quot; the Yemeni official in Sanaa, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The tourists -- three men and two women aged between 50 and 64 -- were kidnapped on their way to archaeological sites last week by members of the al-Masni tribe in the Khawlan area of Yemen, about 65 km (40 miles) east of the capital Sanaa.</p>
<p>Since then Yemen authorities have been in negotiations with the kidnappers to secure the hostages' release.</p>
<p>Poland's ambassador to Sanaa, Krzysztof Suprowicz, also denied reports that the hostages were already free, but said talks were progressing, their release was a only a matter of time, and they were physically and psychologically well.</p>
<p>He told Poland's private Radio Zet from Yemen that a new round of negotiations on freeing the five, who were abducted by the tribesmen last week, had begun on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;Reaching an understanding is really a matter of time...it appears that the standpoints of the sides are starting to converge,&quot; Suprowicz said, adding that talks could end within the hour, last into the night or resume on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday a Polish foreign ministry official in Warsaw had cited Yemeni authorities as saying the hostages had already been released, although he added that this had not been confirmed by Polish diplomats on the spot.</p>
<p>On Friday, the tribesmen fired grenades at military forces who had surrounded them, killing three soldiers and wounding five.</p>
<p>In recent years, tribes in Yemen with grievances against the government or foreign oil firms have kidnapped foreigners to use in bargaining with the authorities, often over land or water issues or requests for aid.</p>
<p>Polish officials have declined to name the hostages.</p>
<p>A leading member of a club devoted to exotic foreign travel told Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper she believed they were from the Polish Explorers's Society.</p>
<p>Biologist Zofia Sikorska-Piwowska said their reported ages and sexes fitted those of five society members who had left on December 10 for a tour of Yemen, Ethiopia and Sudan and who included a freelance journalist and a couple of physicists.</p>
