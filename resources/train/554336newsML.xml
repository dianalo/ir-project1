<title>UK: Sterling slumbers in Europe ahead UK vote outcome.</title>
<headline>Sterling slumbers in Europe ahead UK vote outcome.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sterling was holding steady at lower levels against the mark and dollar in quiet trade, thinned by a holiday for much of Europe and caution ahead of the outcome of today's UK election.</p>
<p>There was little impact from a rise in the April UK purchasing managers' index to 53.1 from 52.8 in March and 52.9 forecast. The survey showed continued growth for manufacturers but some weakness in prices and exports, a symptom of sterling's strength, said analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;The pound has trickled off a bit but we haven't broken any dangerous levels either way,&quot; said a German bank dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was little appetite to put on fresh positions ahead of the outcome of today's election. And with the opposition Labour party maintaining its lead over the ruling Conservatives in the latest opinion polls, a Labour victory has largely been priced in.</p>
<p>The Labour party declined to comment on rumours that a monetary meeting scheduled for May 7 between Bank of England Governor Eddie George and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be postponed if Labour won today's election.</p>
<p>The market is expecting Labour to tighten interest rates in the near-term if it wins the election.</p>
<p>&quot;The basis for this (rumour) is that it will give the Chancellor time to read the brief and get up-to-date before he addresses any big changes,&quot; Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good rationale, but I don't expect a delay to last long if that does happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Sterling was trading at 2.8035/45 marks and $1.6230/35 against 2.8057/67 marks and $1.6201/11 late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The pound stepped back from fresh 4-1/2 year highs against the yen seen in earlier trade.</p>
<p>By 1238 GMT, the pound was trading at 206.06/6.36 from levels around 206.75 late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Irish pound was soft against sterling but holding above the multi-year lows seen after Wednesday's slide.</p>
<p>Speculation the Irish authorities are keen to allow the punt to depreciate towards its central ERM rate ahead of monetary union in 1999 pushed the punt lower across the board.</p>
<p>The punt's weakness was also seen as an indication it is decoupling from sterling which had helped push the Irish unit up over 11 percent above its ERM parity this year.</p>
<p>Irish Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn provided some calm in the markets Wednesday, saying no decision had been made yet on EMU conversion rates.</p>
<p>The punt stood at 0.9130/60 sterling from 0.9230 Wednesday.</p>
