<headline>IMM currency futures mixed,marks, Swiss francs off.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>IMM currency futures were mixed in light, cautious trade, with marks and Swiss francs leading declines on continued concerns about EMU, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Political turmoil in Germany grew over the weekend, as German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling alliance debated the membership criteria for EMU.</p>
<p>Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian premier and an influential member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), threatened to block German membership in EMU if the 3.0 percent budget criteria were not met.  </p>
<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said in an interview with Hesse Radio that a commitment to lasting stability was more important for EMU than meeting the deficit target.</p>
<p>September marks set a contract low at $0.5756, or about 1.7470 spot marks, on GLOBEX.</p>
<p>One currency futures floor trader looks for September to test $0.5653 in the near term, or about 1.7478 spot marks.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party is allied with the CSU, will speak at a press conference later this morning.  </p>
<p>The CDU's executive committee was meeting on Monday to discuss the federal budget for 1997 and 1998 and prospects for EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, Kohl has a lot at stake with the EMU,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>September marks and Swiss francs both held above the lows set on GLOBEX. Support for September Swiss francs is at the two-month low of $0.6900, or about 1.4650 spot.</p>
<p>Further support is at $0.6880 and $0.6840, or 1.4752 spot. The contract low is at $0.6835. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has discouraged flight-to-quality buying of Swiss francs.  </p>
<p>However, flight-to-quality purchases of sterling lifted the currency on the cash crosses and boosted futures.</p>
<p>September sterling faces resistance at $1.6640, Friday's high and $1.6692, the 5-3/4-month high set last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, September Canadian dollars continued to rise from overnight levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact it tested $0.7289 (or 1.3785 spot) is a good sign,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The contract rose to $0.7307, with resistance at $0.7310.</p>
<p>Mexican peso futures were slightly lower, but one floor trader expects September to edge higher later in the week.  </p>
<p>Some traders are looking for peso futures to fall on profit-taking ahead of Mexico's July 6 mid-term elections.</p>
<p>September yen was slightly higher, inching up to $0.008845 after the stronger-than-expected June Chicago NAPM and U.S. May new home sales data. Marks and Swiss francs cut losses.</p>
<p>At 0911 CDT/1411 GMT, Sept yen was up $0.000015 at $0.008842, marks were down $0.0007 at $0.5775, Swiss francs were down $0.0009 at $0.6932, sterling rose $0.0008 at $1.6604, Can dollars were off $0.0001 at $0.7281, Aussie dollars were up $0.0023 at $0.7484 and pesos were down $0.000100 at $0.121550.
