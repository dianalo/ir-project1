<p>Romania's over-the-counter (OTC) share market ended mixed on Monday as big investors awaited fresh lows in the prices of major companies ahead of an expected rise later in the week.</p>
<p>The independent index VAB-RASDAQ, computed by VANGUARD securities, rose by 0.49 percent from the previous session to 3,568.47 points. Another unofficial index, the BIG-OTC, compiled by BIG brokerage house, slipped 0.3 percent to 2,609.53 points.</p>
<p>Operators said the slide might continue in some of the listings for a day or two. They expected a rally later in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;The downswing in some of the attractive stocks has been taking hold for quite some time,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The market is due to see a rebound.&quot;</p>
<p>Cement makers stayed in the limelight, with Romcim closing 500 lei stronger at 65,500 and Casial inching down by 150 lei to end at 1,500 in greater supply.</p>
<p>Oil refinery Arpechim, another key attraction, ended flat at 25,000 lei.</p>
<p>Plane maker IAR gained 1,000 lei to close at 41,000 in thin trade and operators said they expected the stock to make further gains thanks to a deal with U.S. helicopter maker Bell Helicopter Textron to be signed this week.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Bell Helicopter would buy a significant stake of the Romanian company. Details of the deal are expected on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Overall turnover climbed to 8.08 billion lei from 7.32 billion last Friday with more than 3.5 million shares changing hands.</p>
