<p>Indian domestic edible oil prices eased on reports of good monsoon rains in groundnut growing areas and sustained import arrivals of palm olein oil, industry officials and traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have somewhat eased on revival of monsoon rains in the last two or three days in Saurashtra,&quot; Navinbhai Shah, president of the Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange Ltd, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Saurashtra region in western Gujarat state contributes about 35 percent of the country's groundnut output.</p>
<p>Traders said groundnut oil was quoted at 37,800 rupees per tonne, down from about 38,000 rupees last week. Palm olein oil was quoted at 25,100 rupees, down from 25,500 rupees last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Rains in Madhya Pradesh are also excellent,&quot; Shah said. Traders said soybean sowing in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, which accounts for 80 percent of soybean output, was nearly over.</p>
<p>Industry officials said about 35,000 tonnes of imported oil were arriving every week at the Indian ports which includes 8,000 tonnes at the Bombay ports.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect imports in the month of July to be about 150,000 tonnes,&quot; said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports are constantly coming due to a dip in global prices and lean (domestic arrivals) season here,&quot; Mehta said.</p>
<p>Midday reports from Malaysia said that palm olein prices were lower as sentiment turned easier due to hedge selling and lack of follow-through support.</p>
<p>At the midday close, Malaysian palm oil October futures contract was down one ringgit at 1,153 ($439.57).</p>
<p>Mehta said India imported about 900,000 tonnes of edible oil between November 1996 and June 1997. The country imported 1.25 million tonnes of edible oil in 1995/96 (Nov-Oct).</p>
<p>&quot;International prices had eased during the past one month due to higher palm oil crop expectation in Malaysia,&quot; said one Bombay-based commodity analyst.</p>
<p>Industry officials said edible oil prices had fallen to very low levels and a further drop was not expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices have stabilised at lower levels,&quot; Shah said. &quot;I don't think prices will fall further.&quot;</p>
