<p>The dollar suffered a bout of position-adjustment selling at the European close, dropping sharply against both the mark and the yen.</p>
<p>Dealers said the release of the NAPM report for April, showing a drop in the activity and in the prices index served as an excuse to sell dollars as the data cast further doubt about a U.S. interest rate rise in the near-term. The key data release is still to come though - the U.S. jobs report on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The selling was due to market positioning,&quot; said Peter von Maydell, senior currency economist at UBS. The dollar adjusted to the Treasury market's movements this week, he said.</p>
<p>Stop-loss selling on both dollar/mark and dollar/yen pushed the U.S. currency below 1.72 marks and close to 126 yen.</p>
<p>Vague talk about central bank intervention on dollar/yen circulated in the forex market but dealers said the dollar came under pressure from selling by big funds, mainly out of the U.S., and options-related selling. Thin trading conditions, with much of Europe closed for May Day and the parliamentary election in the UK, exaggerated some of the movements, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1508 GMT the dollar was at 1.7182/92 marks, down over a pfennig from its session highs at 1.7334 and from 1.7213/18 at the previous European close.</p>
<p>Against the yen it was at 126.20/30 yen, down from a fresh 55-month peak at 127.47 and from 126.93/98 late here Wednesday. Dollar/yen had been pushed higher overnight on the coat-tails on a surge in the Australian dollar against the yen to above 100 yen for the first time since May 1992 amid heavy buying by yield-hungry Japanese investors.</p>
<p>The late European sell-off pushed the dollar sharply lower across the board. It ended below 5.80 French francs, down from 5.8330 at the close on Wednesday, and just above 1,700 lire, down from 1712. Against the generally weaker Swiss franc, it was down at 1.4660/70 from 1.4750/60.</p>
<p>Some analysts also cited talk that a balanced U.S. budget deal was imminent as putting pressure on the dollar, based on the assumption that a fiscal tightening would reduce the need for higher U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is getting kick about quite a bit now by rumours, and we have seen some big selling out of the U.S. with lots of stops triggered,&quot; said a dealer at a UK bank.</p>
<p>Sterling/mark was dealt a blow by the dollar/mark slide. The pound was at 2.7940/50, down from 2.8057/67 late on Wedneday. Sterling/dollar was at $1.6242/52 against $1.6201/11.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour party is expected to win the election. The Irish pound remained under pressure after its slide on Wednesday amid speculation that the Irish authorities are now keen to allow the currency to weaken toward its central rate in the European exchange rate mechanism at 2.4111 marks in preparation for Europena monetary union in 1999. The Irish pound was at 2.5621/46 compared with 2.5960/40 late in European trading on Wednesday. -- Astrid Zweynert London newsroom + 44 171 542 7792</p>
