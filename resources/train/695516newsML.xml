<title>ESTONIA: BOURSE TO TRADE STOCK OPTIONS IN 1998.</title>
<headline>BOURSE TO TRADE STOCK OPTIONS IN 1998.</headline>
<dateline>TALLINN 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Tallinn stock exchange said on Monday that it had made a decision in principle to begin stock options trading in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We discussed the issue (stock options trading) at the last board meeting on Friday and the answer was positive,&quot; Helo Meigas, managing director of the exchange, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The answer was positive in the sense that we will eventually bring options trading to the bourse, but not before 1998,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Meigas said that new regulations would be needed for options trading to begin on the bourse.</p>
<p>Hansapank, the only bank actively trading stock options, was happy with the move.</p>
<p>&quot;If options were traded with stocks it would be very good and make it easier,&quot; Tonis Haavel, Hansapank's options trader, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Options trading in Estonia is still new.</p>
<p>Hansapank started trading options through a book system in November 1996. Hansapank offers options for up to six months.</p>
<p>Hoiupank has also expressed interest in trading in stock options and the two banks have held talks on using a compatible trading system.</p>
