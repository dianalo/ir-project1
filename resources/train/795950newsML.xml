<headline>FOCUS-European stocks fall as Wall St rally fails.</headline>

<p>European equity markets ended lower after a turbulent Wednesday afternoon as Wall Street failed to sustain an opening rally despite key U.S. economic data which virtually removed all fears of a near term rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to its lowest level against the mark for two weeks after the Bundesbank said it would ensure price stability is maintained.</p>
<p>The London stock market closed 1.4 percent down, its biggest one-day loss for five months, French shares lost 2.49 percent, and fears of an imminent rise in German interest rates drove Frankfurt stocks down 3.21 percent.</p>
<p>Hopes were high early in the afternoon that a benign set of U.S. data on factory gate prices and retail sales figures would help Wall Street recover from sharp losses on Tuesday and pull European markets out of the negative territory explored this morning.</p>
<p>An opening rally on Wall Street saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise to 8040.51 points, up 79.67, after the release of figures showing a 0.1 percent fall in the July producer price index, the seventh monthly decline in a row, and a 0.6 percent rise in July retail sales.</p>
<p>European markets moved up from their midday lows in Wall Street's wake as the data appeared to lay to rest traders' fears of higher U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had seven consecutive months...of declines in the producer price index. This is unprecedented in U.S. economic history,&quot; said Thomas Carpenter, chief economist and managing director at A.S.B. Capital in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;What this means is that from the (Federal Reserve) standpoint it is virtually impossible to increase the level of Fed funds on August 19,&quot; Carpenter added.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank is due to meet to consider whether to adjust interest rates on August 19.</p>
<p>But the failure of the bond market to capitalise on the benign inflation data undercut the stock market rally and the Dow Jones fell back to 7879.08, down 81.76. In late trade the index was close to opening levels at 7962.70</p>
<p>The Dow's morning plunge left European stock markets about where they were at midday.</p>
<p>London's FTSE-100 index of leading shares closed at 5003.6 points, down 72.2 points.</p>
<p>Some London traders wondered whether the afternoon's turmoil was a sign that the long-awaited end of the bull market was just around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't believe what we're seeing out of Wall Street. As the day progresses, (share) prices have moved so rapidly that people have withdrawn their interest,&quot; one broker complained.</p>
<p>&quot;This immense volatility could be an indication that the market is running out of momentum,&quot; UK stock strategist Corey Miller of Credit Lyonnais Laing said of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>London's morning decline was partly influenced by the potentially inflationary impact of a greater than expected fall in U.K. unemployment.</p>
<p>Official figures showed that 5.5 percent of the workforce was unemployed in July, down from 5.7 percent in June, a sharper fall than the market had bargained for.</p>
<p>However, U.K. interest rates are unlikely to rise again soon. A Bank of England report signalled that monetary policy may stay on hold after four successive monthly rate rises.</p>
<p>Bank of England Deputy Governor Mervyn King said that the period of stability now possible in U.K. monetary policy may not be followed by an increase in interest rates.</p>
<p>These remarks helped drive sterling to its lowest level for a month, at 2.90 marks.</p>
<p>Paris also took its cue from U.S. stocks, moving off the lows when Wall Street opened, only to fall back later. The CAC-40 index closed 74.53 points, or 2.49 percent, down at 2924.04.</p>
<p>The tone in Frankfurt was gloomier than in London and Paris, as traders were unsettled by the talk of an imminent rise in German interest rates.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index ended computerised trading 3.21 percent lower at 4237.06 points. Floor trade ended with the DAX index down 1.94 percent, or 84.61 points, at 4278.48.</p>
<p>The dollar's weakness stemmed from a hawkish assessment on German inflation by the Bundesbank, traders said.</p>
<p>In its August monthly report, published early on Wednesday, the Bundesbank said it could not overlook a stronger rise in consumer prices in the last few months, and would shape its policy in such a way that price stability can be maintained.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, data for July showed that German inflation rose to 1.9 percent, the highest level since June 1995 and up from 1.7 percent in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The assertion that the exchange rate is very significant in policy decisions, the fact that they highlight the recent rise in some inflation figures and the desire to see M3 growth lower, suggest they may be closer to a rate increase than previously thought,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at Bank of America in London.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8355/65 marks and 115.70/80 yen, compared with 1.8665 and 115.78 in late trading on Tuesday.</p>
