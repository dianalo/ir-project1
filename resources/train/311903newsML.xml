<p>Iran on Thursday urged Pakistan to prevent the assassination of Shi'ites Moslems in Pakistan, the Iranian news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It quoted Hassan Rowhani, secretary of Iran's National Security Council, as calling on the Pakistani government to mount a &quot;crackdown on terrorist groups in Pakistan and (prevent) the assassination of Shi'ite Moslems&quot;.</p>
<p>He made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahibzada Yaqoob Khan.</p>
<p>&quot;The groups not only endanger Pakistan's security but also hamper the unity of Moslems,&quot; said Rowhani, a Shi'ite cleric.</p>
<p>Two Shi'ite leaders were killed in separate incidents in Pakistan on December 31 and a Shi'ite activist was gunned down on Monday.</p>
<p>The attacks appeared to be connected to a long-running feud between armed Sunni and Shi'ite groups that cost more than 40 lives last year in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan is dominated by Sunnis, Islam's majority sect, while Iran is mainly Shi'ite.</p>
<p>Khan earlier discussed the crisis in neighbouring Afghanistan and bilateral ties with Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, IRNA said. He met Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Iran and Pakistan hold contrasting views of the Taleban Islamic movement, which seized Kabul in September, but have sought to contain their differences by maintaining a dialogue on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Iran has charged Pakistan with setting up and supporting the Taleban, saying the group is also backed by the United States. Pakistan denies favouring any faction.</p>
<p>Tehran recognises the government of ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani but it has urged Afghan factions to reach a power-sharing agreement.</p>
