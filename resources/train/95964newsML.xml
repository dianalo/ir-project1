<p>Wall Street stocks raced to new record levels at Friday's midsession after a shockingly weak September payrolls report calmed inflation fears and triggered furious buying in the bond market.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose 37 points to 5970 after climbing as many as 50 points in late morning activity and the S&amp;P 500 jumped eight points to top the 700 mark for the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;From the market's perspective, the (payrolls) report seemed to validate the soft-landing school of thought,&quot; said Michael Metz, Oppenheimer &amp; Co chief investment strategist.  </p>
<p>The September employment data included an unexpected 40,000 decline in non-farm payrolls. Economists had expected non-farm payroll growth to slow in the month, but even so had called for about 166,000 jobs to be added.</p>
<p>Bonds surged on the figure, which confirmed a slowing of the economy and dispelled some of the worst fears about the near-term prospect of inflation.  The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury surged more than a full point, pushing the yield down to the psychologically key 6.75 level.</p>
<p>The stocks market's rally was less dramatic, and analysts noted the news was actually a mixed blessing for equities.  </p>
<p>&quot;You can't get away from the possibility that in a slowing economy, earnings will also slow,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.</p>
<p>A weak earnings report at one Dow component -- Aluminum Co of America -- pulled the average well off its highs.</p>
<p>Alcoa, which was halted for trading ahead of release of its earnings, reported a third quarter profit of $0.39 per share after accounting for a $0.38 charge.</p>
<p>The earnings were well short of analysts' estimates and upon resuming trade, Alcoa slumped three points to 57-1/2, dragging the Dow industrials lower with it.  </p>
<p>Concern about upcoming earnings has tended to undermine the stock market's ability to participate in bond market rallies the way it had earlier in the year and analysts said a severe slowing of the economy would only intensify worries.</p>
<p>&quot;You're already seeing a dramatic slowdown in the rate of earnings growth,&quot; Metz said, &quot;and I believe we're going to see more pressure on corporate profits in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>The increasingly favorable interest rate environment was greeted quite enthusiastically in the rate-sensitive financial sector, which saw share prices surge.  </p>
<p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co soared 5-3/8 to 266-3/8, BankAmerica Corp jumped two points to 86-1/2, Bankers Trust New York Corp gained 1-3/4 to 81-5/8 and Morgan Stanley Group Inc climbed 1-3/8 to 51-1/2.</p>
<p>In individual issues Stratus Computer Inc jumped 2-3/4 to 22-1/2 after Salomon Brothers upgraded the shares to strong buy.</p>
<p>Raytheon Co tumbled 4-1/8 to 48-7/8 after warning its third quarter operating income would be about 15 percent lower than year-ago levels.  </p>
<p>Redhook Ale slid 4-5/16 to 16-3/4 after Smith Barney downgraded the shares to neutral from outperform.</p>
