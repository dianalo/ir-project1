<p>Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov accused NATO on Sunday of nurturing plans to wrest control of nuclear weapons from Moscow and transfer them to international supervision .</p>
<p>Rodionov, in an annual address marking armed forces day, acknowledged the services were living on &quot;emergency reserves&quot;. Fifty percent of food and fuel had been used up as well as nearly all spare parts for military hardware.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have plenty of planes and rockets, but we may lose reliability in the command systems,&quot; Rodionov was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as saying.</p>
<p>He said more than a half of the officers whose contracts expired this year were not planning to renew them.</p>
<p>Rodionov voiced deeper concerns, saying the West was trying to use problems in the Russian army as a pretext for bringing its nuclear arsenal, bedrock of Moscow's past superpower status, under international control.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO is making every effort to deprive Russia of its strategic nuclear forces,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO could pose the question of controlling Russian nuclear forces under the aegis of the U.N.&quot;</p>
<p>He suggested Washington was manoeuvring to undermine Kremlin authority and denounced NATO plans for eastward expansion.</p>
<p>&quot;The Americans are driving a wedge between Russia and Ukraine,&quot; he said. Russia faced continuing trouble in the Caucasus following the Chechen war and in Central Asia, where the civil war in Tajikistan continues to simmer.</p>
<p>&quot;If in these conditions we lose our officer corps and NATO comes closer to Russia's borders, its bid for outside control of Russian strategic nuclear forces will be quite real,&quot; he said in a speech celebrating Defenders of the Fatherland Day.</p>
<p>Comments by senior Russian politicians, including Rodionov himself, suggesting Russia's nuclear command system could become shaky have caused some concern in the West. But it was unclear what Rodionov was referring to when he spoke of a bid to strip Moscow of its arsenal.</p>
<p>Donning the general's uniform he gave up last year to become Russia's first civilian defence minister, he also sharply criticised Kremlin political officials for covering up what he said was the alarmingly poor state of the cash-starved army.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin promised in last year's re-election campaign to end conscription and create a purely professional army by the turn of the century. He admitted on Sunday that he knew the military had problems but promised to pay off the state's unpaid bills and said reforms were making progress.</p>
<p>&quot;Soldiers should be optimistic,&quot; Yeltsin told reporters. &quot;We are sure the military readiness of our army...will remain, as before at a high level. Of that I am convinced.&quot;</p>
<p>But Rodionov said: &quot;Almost nothing has been done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If concrete steps are not taken in the near future, by 2000 or thereabouts, our country's defences will be in ruins,&quot; he told retired senior officers, demanding the government at least meet its budget commitments and pay its debts to the military.</p>
<p>He also hit out at Kremlin Defence Council Secretary Yuri Baturin.</p>
<p>The civilian Baturin, in an interview with Tass, said Russia's economic problems meant it could not increase defence spending. &quot;We should be talking first and foremost about a more rational utilisation of the defence rouble,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, laying a wreath for Russia's war dead by the Kremlin, repeated Moscow's fierce opposition to NATO's plans to admit former Soviet-bloc countries in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>But, in his first public appearance since going down with pneumonia at New Year, he said expected to strike a deal with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a Helsinki summit on March 20-21.</p>
<p>Several thousand of Yeltsin's hardline communist and nationalist opponents marched under red flags through central Moscow on Sunday accusing the administration of wrecking the Soviet superpower and exposing Russia to NATO &quot;expansionism&quot;.</p>
