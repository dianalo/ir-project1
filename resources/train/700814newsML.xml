<p>Greek short-run interbank depos and forex forwards were driven lower by improved liquidity conditions, long tenors were easier and bonds were little changed with two-year zeros and T-bills hitting the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Ecu/drachma was locked in familiar ranges, currently trading around 309.40/45.</p>
<p>&quot;There is more liquidity and as a result short-term rates have eased about a fourth of a point,&quot; said a senior dealer at a private bank. &quot;Long-term rates are also trading five to 10 basis points lower.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said liquidity could be further boosted if sales of zeros and T-bills did not cover maturities. About 200 billion drachmas of 12-month T-bills expire today.</p>
<p>Greece issues 12-month T-bills and two-year zeros at a gross rate of 9.60 percent and 9.50 percent respectively today.</p>
<p>Bonds were fluctuating in tight ranges with players awaiting to see how the zeros and 12-month T-bill would fare today.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading activity is subdued and bond prices are frozen with the market focusing on T-bills and two-year zeros,&quot; a bond dealer said. &quot;Some banks have come up with some financial instruments offering more attractive interest rates that the state's.&quot;</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 157.73/83 from Monday's 157.685 fix, the dollar at 275.32/42 drachmas from 275.220 and the ecu at 310.17/27 from 309.330 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma opened at 309.46/51 and eased a bit to trade currently around 309.40/45,&quot; said a forex trader at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece quoted the following early rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 10.10-10.60</p>
<p>** T/N at 10.10-10.60</p>
