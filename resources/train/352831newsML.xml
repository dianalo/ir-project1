<p>It may never be up there in the ratings with Dallas and Baywatch, but Vietnam's first-ever television soap opera looks set to be a hit at home.</p>
<p>A 30-part story of four generations laced with humour, suspense and tragedy, &quot;Wind Blows Through Dark and Light&quot; has been trumpeted in local newspapers as a roaring success even before it goes on air.</p>
<p>That may have more than a little to do with the government, which is just as keen on the soap's popular entertainment value as its didactic potential.</p>
<p>&quot;Wind Blows Through Dark and Light&quot; is not about HIV, the virus which leads to AIDS.</p>
<p>But it has a few hard-hitting messages about the deadly disease which its 15 million-plus viewers -- be they in cities, farming communities or remote mountain villages -- would find hard to miss.</p>
<p>&quot;This... is not about preaching, it's not about hitting people over the head,&quot; says Brian Doolan, country director of the aid group Care International, which has helped produce the European Commission-backed show.</p>
<p>&quot;It's about subtly introducing some messages but in the midst of an entertaining television series. Basically we're entertaining and there is a message in there if people want to hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>Dreams of owning a car or an automatic washing machine are, for most of Vietnam's 77 million people, just that -- dreams. But, poverty notwithstanding, the vast majority now has access to a television.</p>
<p>The communist government, an old hand at mass propaganda, has not been slow to grasp that opportunity in its bid to bolster public awareness of HIV/AIDS and encourage safe sex.</p>
<p>Cheery TV ads to promote condom use, a difficult subject in a nation where sexual matters are rarely discussed in public, have been followed more recently by sinister ones which work on fear.</p>
<p>The non-profit humanitarian group DKT International, which works with the government on the adverts, says the message is getting through.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there is a brand awareness that there never used to be,&quot; says DKT's Project Director Andrew Piller. &quot;That gives people a handle to talk about condoms without having to say 'condom'&quot;.</p>
<p>Over 30 million condoms were sold nationwide last year, more than in the three previous years put together. That is a breakthrough for a country which, although no Thailand, has become one of the region's biggest AIDS victims.</p>
<p>According to official government data, compiled from police records and death certificates, less than 5,000 cases of HIV/AIDS have been recorded.</p>
<p>United Nations AIDS experts in Hanoi believe that figure is unreliable. They say the number of HIV cases in Vietnam is already 60,000, will rise to around 100,000 by the end of this year and hit 350,000 by 2000.</p>
<p>There are two main AIDS epidemics in Vietnam -- the first is among male drug users in Ho Chi Minh City and the second is among prostitutes in the western Mekong Delta who do brisk business across the border in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Despite its questionable figures, the government is not denying the seriousness of its AIDS problem.</p>
<p>In the first few years of its official AIDS campaign, from 1990 to 1993, the government focused on jailing people involved in the sex trade and drug abusers.</p>
<p>Some AIDS committee officials now recognise that this approach may have been counterproductive.</p>
<p>Instead of encouraging behaviour change, it drove intravenous drug users underground where HIV could spread silently through the sharing of contaminated needles.</p>
<p>Now the thrust of the campaign has changed.</p>
<p>Every town in the country has its own forest of billboards which still fume against drug abuse and prostitution. But, like the television adverts and now the soap opera, they also tackle a widely held belief that dirty needles and the sex trade are the only ways to catch AIDS.</p>
<p>One of the main characters in &quot;Wind Blows Through Dark and Light&quot;, a trucker who has had many sexual encounters on his travels, falls in love with a woman back at home. Before their relationship can blossom, it emerges that he is HIV positive.</p>
<p>Le Tuan Anh, the series' dashing lead actor and already something of a celebrity, says the soap will encourage sympathy rather than the disgust usually reserved for AIDS victims.</p>
<p>&quot;This programme does not criticise AIDS patients, it expresses sympathy for them,&quot; he says. &quot;They are young, but they have lost their youth, their careers, everything. We feel sorry for them, we don't hate them.&quot;</p>
