<p>British media and leisure company Pearson Plc said on Wednesday that video retuning costs for the launch of Channel 5 would rise to around 150 million stg.</p>
<p>The company said that trading conditions in the second half of the year were in line with those of the first half and with group plans as previously announced.  </p>
<p>Pearson said that losses from its Mindscape consumer software company were expected to be in line with earlier estimates. The company said in May it expected Mindscape to post losses of some 46 million stg in 1996.</p>
<p>It added that its &quot;Back Office Project&quot; to improve the efficiency of its major publishing businesses had been agreed. It said the charge to profits would be around five million stg for both 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>The company, which earns a significant proportion of profits in the U.S. dollar and Spanish peseta, said the recent strength of sterling would have a minimal impact on 1996 results.  </p>
<p>But it added that profit before tax would have been lower by an estimated six million stg if the current exchange rates had prevailed throughout 1996 as a whole.</p>
<p>Pearson is a 24 percent shareholder in Channel 5, a new terrestrial television channel which will launch on March 30 1997. Its partners in the Channel 5 consortium are United News &amp; Media, U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus and Luxembourg broadcast group CLT.</p>
<p>Pearson said in August that retuning costs to deal with signal problems would be around 100 million stg. But Channel 5 has since been awarded an additional frequency -- boosting its coverage to 80 percent of the UK but pushing up costs.</p>
<p>Pearson said the Channel 5 business plan showed significantly higher rates of return than at the time of the original bid.</p>
<p>It said the additional retuning costs and a recently acquired major film package from Fox would be accommodated within the original funding agreed by shareholders of up to 300 million stg.</p>
