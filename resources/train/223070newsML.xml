<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said Italy would not face any discrimination when it came to assessment of criteria for joining Europe's single currency but it could not expect any privileges either.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy will not face discrimination but it cannot expect privileges. That's the same for Germany,&quot; he said, adding this also applied to other countries wanting to join European economic and monetary union from the start.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer was answering questions after giving a speech at the European University Institute on the outskirts of Florence.</p>
<p>He criticised certain European politicians, without naming them, for trying to convince their public that strict structural measures were the necessary price for monetary unmion.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not happy with what's going on in European countries. A lot of politicians are selling structural measures as a price for monetary union,&quot; he said, adding these measures were in fact in the interests of the countries themselves.</p>
<p>He said such adjustments could create negative sentiment towards the idea of European union.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said earlier in his speech that Italy still had work to do to meet Maastricht qualification but he welcomed the lira's return to the European currency grid last weekend.</p>
