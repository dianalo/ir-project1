<headline>SOCCER-FANS ATTACK PLAYERS ON PITCH.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Four men were in police custody on Saturday following an incident in an English third division soccer match when fans ran on the pitch and attacked the referee and some of the players.</p>
<p>The match between Brighton and visiting Leyton Orient was disrupted for five minutes after the fans ran on to the field and began punching and kicking referee Fraser Stretton.</p>
<p>They were then involved in tussles with several Leyton Orient players, including former Manchester United and England midfielder Ray Wilkins and goalscorer Scott McGleish.</p>
<p>The fans invaded the pitch from the area containing home supporters after McGleish put Orient 4-3 ahead with 15 minutes to go. They were wrestled to the ground by players, police and stewards.</p>
<p>The game eventually restarted and Brighton, who are bottom of the division and in the middle of a bitter boardroom dispute, went on to equalise for a 4-4 draw.</p>
<p>Brighton have already had two points deducted this season following a pitch invasion in a match against Lincoln in October.</p>
<p>The English Football Association has promised a full investigation into Saturday's incident.</p>
