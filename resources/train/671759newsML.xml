<headline>States wait for tobacco companies' response.</headline>

<p>Tobacco talks were at a critical stage Wednesday morning as state officials waited to hear whether the tobacco industry would accept their demands.</p>
<p>The state attorneys general threatened to walk away from negotiations on Tuesday unless cigarette makers agreed that tobacco would be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and that they could be punished for wrongful conduct and be held liable for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<p>Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire told Reuters that the industry had asked the state officials late on Tuesday night if it could consider the demands overnight and give the states an answer Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>A total of 38 states have sued cigarette makers to recoup health care costs of treating sick smokers. The negotiations have been pressured by the fact that the first trial of a state Medicaid suit is set to begin in Mississippi on July 7.</p>
<p>Both sides had hoped to reach an agreement before that trial started but the talks have shown signs of unravelling as industry officials' attitude toward punitive damages and FDA regulation has hardened.</p>
<p>The talks are aimed at a broad settlement of the huge legal claims against the industry in return for some form of increased regulation and curbs on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.</p>
<p>During part of the day on Tuesday it looked as if the talks might collapse when the industry refused to give in on key issues of FDA regulation and punitive damages.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said on Tuesday that negotiations have been &quot;rocky, hard, tough, brutal, sometimes mean, and today was one of those days.&quot;</p>
<p>Talks between tobacco industry representatives and the state attorneys general have been going on since early April.</p>
<p>Although it had appeared the two sides were close to a deal last week, B.A.T Industries, Plc, the parent company of Brown and Williamson Tobacco, objected to language concerning FDA regulation and encouraged other companies not to give in.</p>
<p>The attorneys general hoped to get a deal this week and send a proposal to the White House for review. One of the options they considered was presenting an incomplete proposal with the punitive damage issue still unresolved. Punitive damages are awarded to punish and deter wrongful behaviour.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Tuesday that President Clinton wanted an agreement that would restrict children's access to tobacco products. &quot;But it's hard for us to evaluate something that is not concrete and substantive in nature,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Separately, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has sued the Federal Trade Commission, contending the agency engaged in politically motivated &quot;harassment&quot; in its effort to ban the company's ads featuring the Joe Camel cartoon character.</p>
<p>The suit, which came while the issue of cigarette advertising was being considered in the settlement talks, was filed on Tuesday in federal court in North Carolina. The FTC charged last month that the Joe Camel ads illegally promoted cigarettes to kids. R.J. Reynolds is owned by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.</p>
