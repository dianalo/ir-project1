<p>White sugar futures mustered enough upside momentum to push into positive territory on Monday but the modest volume was mostly derived from May/August switches and crossed trades.</p>
<p>A firmer performance in New York also helped sentiment in London but volume and movements on the raws were also muted, traders said.</p>
<p>One leading commission house led the way with the crossed spread trades, with the nearby May/August spread also attracting some light broker interest.</p>
<p>Little activity was reported on the May white premium, steady at around $66.50.</p>
<p>At 1705 GMT May was up 60 cents at $306.80 and August up 90 cents at $306.20. Volume reached 1,135 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing going on at all, it's very dead,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>In other news, the U.N. is said to have approved the sale of French sugar to Iraq worth some $18 million under the oil-for-food pact, with the contract involving the sale of 50,000 tonnes of French sugar.</p>
<p>The total amount of sugar purchased by Iraq from international firms under a December tender remains unclear, though some traders have estimated it at up to 150,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The leader of Mexico's main sugar workers' union predicted that the national 1996/97 cane harvest would produce a record crop of 4.5 million tonnes of sugar.</p>
<p>Volume was solid on the Paris market with 959 lots traded. May was up $1.10 at $306.10 and August up $1.50 at $306.10.</p>
