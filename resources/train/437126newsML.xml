<title>SWEDEN: Swedish banks wary of bourse merger scheme.</title>
<headline>Swedish banks wary of bourse merger scheme.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-03-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swedish banks holding a major stake in the Stockholm Stock Exchange believe that plans to merge the bourse and the OM futures and options exchange could concentrate too much power in the hands of a few owners.</p>
<p>Business daily Dagens Industri said that the two exchanges were working on a proposal that the OM group, which includes a futures and derivatives exchange, an energy bourse and systems development and consultancy units, would buy the stock exchange.</p>
<p>The merged exchanges would then trade as a unit of the bourse-listed OM group, where the powerful Wallenberg family interests constitute the largest bloc of shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;It is definitely wrong to let the new marketplace be owned by a bourse-listed company. Furthermore we don't want the market to get one or a few dominant owners,&quot; Nordbanken Markets chief Anders Nyren told the Dagens Nyheter daily.</p>
<p>Nordbanken, Handelsbanken, Foreningsbanken and Swedbank between them hold a 20 percent stake in the Stockholm Stock Exchange, the papers said.</p>
<p>The OM group, 20.1 percent owned by the Wallenberg holding company Investor, owns 20.7 percent of the stock exchange. Investor owns another 6.7 percent directly and Wallenberg-associated firms like S-E-Banken hold 15.1 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be better if the parent company were unlisted and had broad ownership,&quot; Bjorn C.Andersen, deputy Handelsbanken chief and stock exchange board-member told Dagens Industri.</p>
<p>&quot;This is primarily about public confidence. We must ensure that the new bourse company cannot suddenly be bought by a new owner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Swedbank's Hakan Kallaker said that the banks' opposition was not directed at the Wallenbergs in particular but to the principle of any group dominating management of a combined securities market.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of owner concentration must be resolved, in that context it makes no difference if it is a Wallenberg company or someone else who is the dominant owner,&quot; he told Dagens Industri.</p>
