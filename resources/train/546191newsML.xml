<p>Cuba featured heavily on the sugar freight market on Tuesday but demand was also cited for Brazil with the main interest for bulk cargoes, shipbrokers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pacol was in the market for a prompt 25,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Cuba to Black Sea and was said to have fixed a prompt 14,000-tonne parcel for the same run.</p>
<p>Vitol quoted for 20/23,000 tonnes in bulk from Maceio to the Egyptian Med, Black Sea or Baltic for May 5/15.</p>
<p>Cargill entered the market with a new order for 14,000 tonnes min/max bulk sugar from Maceio, Recife, Paranagua or Santos to the same set of destination options for May 5/10.</p>
<p>Cargill also quoted for 12/14,000 tonnes in bulk from Thailand to Indonesia for mid-May and 16,800 tonnes from Rio Haina to US Gulf/Atlantic for May 13/20.</p>
<p>Czarnikow Rionda was open for 19,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Puerto Quetzal to US Gulf/Atlantic for the end of May.</p>
<p>Of the day's firmer business, Genoc was said to have fixed a 14,000-tonne bulk cargo from Cuba to the Egyptian Med, Black Sea or Baltic for May and was still open with 25/30,000 tonnes on the same run, again for May.</p>
<p>Shipbrokers said Benham booked tonnage for 7/10,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Georgetown to US Gulf/Atlantic for early May and Kerry Trading 10,000 tonnes from Thailand to south Korea for early May.</p>
<p>Seabon fixed the 1970-built Nektar to ship 14,000 tonnes in bags prompt from the EU to Iran at $44.00.</p>
<p>In other news, Egypt has agreed to resell some of its Brazilian raw sugar contracts because of a local surplus.</p>
<p>Egyptian companies contracted to buy about 500,000 tonnes of raws and some deliveries will be deferred to March 1998 from July 1997.</p>
<p>The International Sugar Organization (ISO) said Russia was once again the largest country of destination for Cuban sugar in 1996, more than doubling its imports compared with 1995</p>
<p>Russia imported 1.83 million tonnes of Cuban raws last year after 722,051 in 1995, the ISO said.</p>
