<p>Defence policymakers from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) briefed Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday on a plan by Tokyo and Washington to revamp their Cold War-era security alliance.</p>
<p>The LDP group had outlined planned changes to the Japan-U.S. &quot;Guidelines for Defence Cooperation&quot; to be unveiled in Hawaii on Saturday, said former foreign minister Taro Nakayama, current head of the LDP's Research Commission for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Qian and the Japanese politicians also discussed bilateral security issues, Nakayama told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>Tokyo has been keen to soothe Chinese concerns over plans to expand its possible defence cooperation with the United States, which are expected to give Japan its highest military profile in Asia since World War Two.</p>
<p>Under the arrangements, Tokyo would for the first time conduct minesweeping during an actual conflict, repair U.S. warships and aircraft, join naval blockades of third countries, and fight under unified command if Japan itself was attacked.</p>
<p>China, which suffered huge losses under Japanese invasion and occupation during the 1930s and 40s, has long seen any change in Tokyo's officially passive defence policy as a possible revival of World War Two-style militarism.</p>
<p>Economic cooperation should grow and military blocs decline as the 21st century dawned, the official Xinhua news agency said Foreign Minister Qian told Nakayama in an apparent warning against over-expansion of Japan-U.S. military ties.</p>
<p>&quot;The world's people expect the new century to be a peaceful one, and, with mankind's development, the sense of confrontation and military blocs should be gradually weakened,&quot; Xinhua quoted Qian as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Asia-Pacific countries should engage in economic exchanges and cooperation,&quot; Qian said.</p>
<p>China is likely to be highly sensitive to any expansion of Japan-U.S. cooperation beyond the current guidelines laid down in 1978, which only cover contingency measures to respond to an attack on Japan by the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Japanese and U.S. defence and foreign affairs officials in Honolulu are to unveil on Saturday their interim report on the ongoing review of the defence guidelines, a key part of the 37-year-old U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.</p>
<p>The final report will be issued in November, spelling out details of defence cooperation such as the number of airports to be opened to U.S. warplanes in a future conflict.</p>
<p>Japanese media reports said that, despite the planned expansion of its role, Japan had held out against joining U.S. forces in actual combat in Asia or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Japan was wary of making its role too broad because of its pacifist constitution as well as concerns that China would see itself as the real target of the newly defined U.S.-Japan military alliance, the reports said.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang this week warned Tokyo not to enlarge the scope of the security pact.</p>
<p>He also called for Sino-Japanese talks to ease a dispute over ownership of an uninhabited but potentially resource-rich island group in the East China Sea that is controlled by Tokyo.</p>
<p>Tensions over the islands, known in Japan as the Senkakus and in China as the Diaoyus, have risen in recent months after Japanese legislators prompted outrage in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan by visiting them to bolster Tokyo's claim.</p>
