<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in moderate trade on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. June consumer price index (CPI), May business inventories and June industrial production and capacity utilisation data.</p>
<p>The consumer price index for June is forcast to show an increase of 0.2 percent compared with a 0.1 percent gain in May.</p>
<p>May business inventories are expected to be unchanged from April's 0.3 percent rise.  </p>
<p>Industrial production for June is expected to show a gain of 0.2 percent versus a 0.4 percent increase in May while capacity utilisation for June is expected to ease to 83.6 percent from May's 83.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was a little bit softer in the morning on some position adjustments. Some people are waiting for tonight's release of the consumer price index, business inventories, industrial production and capacity utilisation data,&quot; a local dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people have squared their positions for the day, so I don't think there will be much impact,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Wednesday/Thursday eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent while Thursday/Friday and week-fixed eased 1/16 point each to a common 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent.</p>
<p>Among longer dates,  one-month was unchanged from Tuesday's 5-5/8 5-1/2 percent, three-months unchanged at 5-3/4 5-5/8, nine-months unchanged at 5-15/16 5-13/16 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-1/16 5-15/16 percent.</p>
