<p>Canadian pipeline operator Westcoast Energy Inc hopes to negotiate a rate agreement with gas shippers in the next few months before its formal application is heard by regulators, president Art Willms said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Westcoast earlier announced it had filed a toll application with the National Energy Board that would see typical tolls rise about 25 percent next year. Willms said Westcoast hoped to reach a rate deal before NEB hearings on that application begin in February and March.  </p>
<p>&quot;We hope to have this (negotiations with shippers) tidied up before then,&quot; Willms said in an interview.</p>
<p>Saying the current system of renewing contracts every year is unworkable, the company wants to move to multi-year arrangements with tolls partly linked to moves in gas prices.</p>
<p>Willms said the rate application and the projected 25 percent toll increase announced Wednesday were not an attempt to pressure shippers.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't inflated the numbers. It's a reflection of the fact that (traditional rate setting methods) in today's world are not going to work,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Shippers have raised concerns about Westcoast potentially having too great a market share in northeastern British Columbia for an alternative, flexible rate-setting system to be successful, he said.</p>
<p>If Westcoast succeeds in negotiating the type of arrangement it wants, Willms said there would be &quot;some increased element of risk&quot; in its earnings, especially from gathering and processing operations. He said there would be more &quot;variability&quot; in line with moves in gas prices.</p>
