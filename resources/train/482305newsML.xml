<p>European economic growth should gather pace this year and next, with the main risk to an otherwise rosy outlook lying in unexpected developments in the U.S. economy, the French finance ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a statement following a review of France's official economic forecasts, it said that if U.S. economic growth failed to slow as expected this would destabilise financial markets, and lead to a rise in long-term interest rates in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>A pre-emptive quarter-point rise in a key U.S. interest rate last month should however head off such a risk, it said.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told a news conference later that markets had reacted calmly to the higher U.S. Fed funds rate and France's own forecasts remained on track.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing of a nature to threaten our forecasts,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>French growth is officially forecast at 2.3 percent this year and 2.8 percent next year, after 1.3 percent last year.</p>
<p>The government said on Wednesday it was sticking to its forecast of 2.3 percent growth this year, but said this was a deliberately cautious prediction and growth may well be higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The 2.3 percent (1997) forecast is a floor,&quot; Arthuis said.</p>
<p>In its report on the economic forecast review, the finance ministry said Europe should enjoy accelerating non-inflationary growth in the next two years.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking forward to 1999, there does not seem to be any significant risk of inflation in Europe, despite the recovery in activity,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>European growth would be helped by the recent fall in long and short term interest rates, and exchange rates for the dollar, sterling and lira which better reflected economic fundamentals. All three have risen against major European currencies, notably the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth rates in the major regions are likely to converge in 1997. In 1998 it will be in Europe that growth will be strongest,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>Growth in the 15-nation European Union was expected to reach 2.4 percent in 1997 and nearly three percent in 1998, compared with 1.8 percent in 1996 and 2.7 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>In the industrialised nations which belong to the Organisation for Eonomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), growth would be around 2.5 percent in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>European growth could even be stronger and the recovery come earlier than expected, particularly if stockbuilding and investment patterns turned around faster, the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the downside, the main risk stems from developments in the U.S. economy and its repercussions on financial markets. If the expected slowdown does not happen, there could be tension on long-term interest rates,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>If this were the case, there could be a stock market correction, a marked slowdown in the U.S. economy, and the rise in long-term rates could spread to Europe.</p>
<p>The process of disinflation undertaken in Europe, however, combined with significant unused production capacity, should protect it from too early a return of inflationary expectations.</p>
