<p>China's B share indices closed higher on Thursday due to signs of improving sentiment, but domestic currency A shares failed to follow suit, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's Hong Kong dollar-denominated B shares closed up on a powerful rebound on Thursday after hitting a low for the year on Wednesday, and analysts said they expected to see more gains led by stocks likely to post good 1997 interim results.</p>
<p>The B share index shot up 5.16 points or 4.28 percent to 125.59 points on turnover of HK$95 million ($12.3 million) compared with HK$94 million on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Shenzhen's B share index closed at its lowest point for the year, at 120.44 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The B index rose on a strong rebound staged by stocks expected to post good interim results,&quot; said an analyst at China Guotai Securities.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's A share index lost 7.1 points or 1.83 percent to 380.33 points, due in part to selling in market leader Shenzhen Development Bank Co just ahead of the close, brokers said. Turnover in the A share market was 4.4 billion yuan ($530.7 million).</p>
<p>Leading A share counter Shenzhen Development Bank dropped 0.92 yuan or 2.86 percent to 33.08 yuan on volume of 7.86 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B shares closed up 1.5 percent on Thursday after an improvement in market sentiment saw retail investors picking up cheap shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>Growing speculation that the government believed recent falls were overdone and would seek to prevent sharp fluctuations in the future helped boost sentiment, they said.</p>
<p>The B share index closed up 1.115 points or 1.51 percent to 74.841 points on volume of 14.529 million shares worth $7.70 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Market sentiment has improved somewhat with two days of gains,&quot; said a broker at a foreign securities firm.</p>
<p>B shares rebounded on Wednesday after steady falls since Hong Kong's July 1 handover to Chinese rule. The handover, the subject of a nationwide media frenzy, had given the market solid support.</p>
<p>Of 45 B shares, 40 traded with 25 up, 12 down and three flat.</p>
<p>Textile maker Shanghai Worldbest Co was the top B share gainer on institutional buying, rising $0.046 or 9.13 percent to $0.550.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the domestic currency A share index reversed earlier gains to close lower on profit taking after talk that a listed firm would be punished for reporting false results, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index fell 1.21 points or 0.10 percent to 1,169.99 points on volume of 304.2 million shares worth 3.52 billion yuan. The SSE30 blue chip index lost 21.94 points or 0.59 percent to 3,692.08 points.</p>
<p>The Shanghai A and B share markets could move up slowly as investors started to focus on companies expected to post good 1997 interim results later this month and in August, brokers said.</p>
