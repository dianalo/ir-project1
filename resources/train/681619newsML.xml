<p>Singapore shares rallied to a strong close on Monday, boosted by some late fund buying notably of banking and index-linked stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank stocks just kept running. I did not hear of any corporate news but there was nibbling by funds,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Most of the banks have become good buys at current levels,&quot; he added. Among them were foreign tranches of DBS, OCBC and UOB. All rose by 40-60 Singapore cents.</p>
<p>Shipping firms Keppel Corp and Sembawang Corp, food company Cerebos Pacific and car retailer Cycle &amp; Carriage boosted the Straits Times Industrials Index 26.35 points to end at 2,034.79.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the shipping firms were bought up despite the dismal industry outlook as the stocks became increasingly under-valued.</p>
<p>Property counters got a lift from the good response and record price of S$1,100 psf paid for leasehold Bishan Eight project in central Singapore. The SES property index ended 6.06 points up at 688.35.</p>
<p>Indonesian-linked Van der Horst ended three cents lower at S$2.19 after trading to S$2.39 as concerns over its financial performance resurfaced. Market volume was light, at 95 million, with 141 gainers to 179 losers.-- Angela Tan (65 8703083)</p>
