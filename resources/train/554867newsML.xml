<p>Tokyo stocks ended modestly higher on Thursday, supported by buying of some major issues after early gains on buying of blue chips were eroded by profit-taking, brokers said. They said gains in recent sessions were too rapid and the indices needed to take a breather.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average rose 124.21 points or 0.65 percent to 19,275.33. Its June futures were 50 higher at 19,300. &quot;The rally has been intense lately and the market needs a small break in order for indices to correct and then continue higher,&quot; said Yasuo Ueki, Nikko Securities general manager.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from profit-taking, dealers who bought earlier with hopes that the indices would rise further sold after the hopes went unfulfilled, starting their position squaring ahead of the three-day weekend a little early,&quot; Ueki added.</p>
<p>In the morning, the benchmark Nikkei rose past the January 6 closing high of 19,446.00 to 19,588.36 as foreign investors continued their quest for global issues, encouraged by the Dow's rise past 7,000 and a huge gain posted by Nikkei futures in Chicago overnight.</p>
<p>Brokers said the yen's further weakening against the dollar also provided support to export-oriented issues.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the yen weakened to 127.45 yen against the dollar, the lowest level since August 1992.</p>
<p>Blue-chip favourite Sony Corp ended up 20 at 9,260 yen after earlier hitting a high of 9,300 yen for the calendar year.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Japan analyst Takatoshi Yamamoto said that he saw Sony as a core issue for the electronics sector and that 10,000 yen was a goal for the share price.</p>
<p>Laggards such as Hitachi Ltd closed 60 yen up at 1,210 after hitting 1,230, a new high for the year. Fujitsu Ltd finished up 30 yen at 1,350, off a high of 1,370.</p>
<p>Brokers said that while some globally competitive stocks retreated, others such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) rose and helped support the overall market.</p>
<p>NTT closed 74,000 yen higher at 969,000 yen after Morgan Stanley Capital International said it had added NTT to its Japan index and due to a British newspaper report on international sales of shares in one of NTT units.</p>
<p>&quot;NTT and major domestic-demand sensitive issues came to life in the afternoon session especially and offset much of the profit-taking losses,&quot; a &quot;Big Four&quot; broker said.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel Corp was the most actively traded issue with volume of 19.70 million issues. It ended nine yen higher at 371.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is beginning to think the stifling effect of the consumption tax increase on the economy is not as serious as envisaged,&quot; a broker at Okasan Securities said. &quot;Steels and chemicals are seen as fairly good buys as a result.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan's consumption was raised to five percent from three percent on April 1, the start of the new business year.</p>
<p>Brokers said the Nikkei average's rise of nearly 1,000 points in the last two weeks made a correction inevitable.</p>
<p>&quot;Fears of a meltdown in the financial sector have taken a back seat,&quot; one broker said. &quot;Foreign investor buying interest seems strong. And if it isn't, pension funds will bargain hunt so the downside should be limited.&quot;</p>
<p>Pulp/paper, shipbuilding, transport equipment, ceramics and communications topped the list of advancing issues. Retreaters were headed by fisheries, gas, railway/bus, electric power and services.</p>
<p>First-section turnover was 613 million shares, up from 458 million the previous day. Winners beat losers 787 to 326, while 141 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The broader TOPIX index added 12.05 points or 0.84 percent to 1,453.24. The Nikkei 300 rose 2.31 points or 0.83 percent to 282.06. The second section index added 12.42 points or 0.75 percent to 1,679.42.</p>
<p>Second-section turnover was 11.27 million shares, compared with 7.35 million shares on Wednesday. The over-the-counter index had added 3.51 points or 0.31 percent to 1,146.69 by late Tokyo. --Masako Iijima, Tokyo Equities Desk (+81-3-3432-8052) (c) Reuters Limited 1997</p>
