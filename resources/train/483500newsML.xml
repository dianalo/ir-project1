<p>China will bar its citizens from travelling to Hong Kong during the month straddling its recovery of the territory from Britain to ensure all goes smoothly, newspapers on Wednesday quoted officials as saying.</p>
<p>The authorities would impose stringent curbs on Chinese visits to the territory between June 15 and July 15, a security chief in China's neighbouring Guangdong Province said.</p>
<p>China would stop issuing round-trip travel permits in the period except for essential business trips, provincial Public Security Bureau vice-director Wang Yinggang was quoted by several Hong Kong newspapers as saying.</p>
<p>In addition, entry to Shenzhen and Zhuhai, southern Chinese boomtowns adjacent to Hong Kong, would be confined to business travellers during the handover period.</p>
<p>Chinese going abroad would also not be allowed to make transit stopovers in the territory between June 30 and July 2.</p>
<p>The measures were designed to maintain order in Hong Kong and ensure smooth handover celebrations when Britain returns the territory to China after more than 150 years. The handover takes place at the stroke of midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>There are fears in the territory of an invasion of Chinese immigrants seeking a slice of Hong Kong's affluence.</p>
<p>Wang also said illegal immigrant children from China -- a major headache in Hong Kong in recent years -- should continue to be repatriated to the mainland after the sovereignty change.</p>
<p>Some mainland parents have smuggled their children into Hong Kong in the hope of gaining an immigration toehold for their families.</p>
