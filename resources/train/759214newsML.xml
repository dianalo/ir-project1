<p>The dollar surged to a seven-and-a-half year peak against the mark on Monday as investors took fright at the prospect of a weak European single currency, and the move boosted some equity markets.</p>
<p>The dollar's strength was seen as a boon for exporters and propelled Paris briefly to a new trading high, though it fell back later, and drove Frankfurt up by 1.25 percent at the close. London also ended with modest gains.</p>
<p>Most of the day's excitement was in the currency markets where the dollar climbed to a peak of 1.8490 marks, its strongest point since November 1989, before easing slightly at the European close.</p>
<p>The dollar has climbed 5.4 percent against the mark in the past three weeks as a conviction grew that Europe's planned economic and monetary union would be launched by a broad group of countries, making for a soft euro.</p>
<p>The rally was given added impetus as signs that the American economy is growing without stoking inflation generated demand for U.S. stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Few currency traders believed that Germany's Bundesbank would act in the near future to curb the mark's weakness and many were looking for the dollar to vault above 1.85 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, nothing short of a Bundesbank official being roused from holiday will threaten the dollar's rise,&quot; said Nick Parsons, currency strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.</p>
<p>The dollar also leapt against the Swiss franc and was riding high against the yen, at 117.71, up nearly a yen on Friday's level.</p>
<p>Bundesbank officials indicated they did not want the mark to weaken further before their summer recess began last week but the words failed to puncture the dollar's bullishness, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market does not believe the Bundesbank for a second in terms of its willingness or its ability to support the mark,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>A batch of U.S. economic reports this week, particularly the July jobs report due out on Friday, is expected to confirm that the U.S. economy is expanding at a healthy pace in a non-inflationary way.</p>
<p>It was a different story for sterling, whose powerful rise of recent months ran into the buffers. The pound shed five pfennigs against the mark -- almost two percent -- during the European session in a wave of profit-taking. Against the dollar it fell three cents from earlier highs.</p>
<p>The stronger dollar had a knock-on effect on European bourses. In Frankfurt the German share market continued its dizzying ascent, fuelled by the dollar as well as a stream of funds looking for a home. The main DAX closed 53.52 points higher at 4,371.16.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot believe it myself, we just keep going higher and higher, but in a situation like this, it would be unwise to position yourself against the trend,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Explaining why the German share market has not tired of its record-breaking ride, dealers said the main reason was that investors had few other places to put their money.</p>
<p>&quot;There is simply a never-ending stream of liquidity coming into the market,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>In Paris shares closed lower, unable to hold late-afternoon gains made on the back of Wall Street and dollar strength, traders said.</p>
<p>The CAC index earlier hit a fresh all-time high in the session at 3,044.24 before retracing, but the market's grip slackened and prices slipped back. Brokers said business was very thin, with summer holidays much in the foreground.</p>
<p>And in London. Europe's biggest bourse, the main FTSE 100 index ended moderately higher, bolstered by strength in the large multinational companies that benefited from the sell-off in sterling, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>But investors were still cautious ahead of a line-up of UK corporate results and this week's U.S. economic data. The FTSE rose 11.1 points to 4,862.6 but decliners led advancers by a 53 to 40 margin.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened today is sterling's weakness,&quot; said Ian Williams, UK equities strategist at Panmure Gordon.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.8460 marks and 117.65 yen in late European trading compared with 1.8350 and 116.75 in late trading on Friday.</p>
