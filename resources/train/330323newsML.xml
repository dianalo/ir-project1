<headline>Brazil '96 external financing was 2.0 pct/GDP.</headline>

<p>Brazil's external accounts financing needs in 1996 were $14.91 billion, equivalent to 2.0 percent of gross domestic product, and easily financed by overseas borrowing and short-term capital inflows, a Central Bank official said.</p>
<p>Altamir Lopes, head of the bank's economics department, said 1996's $24.3 billion current account gap was partially financed by record net foreign direct investment of $9.442 billion, which covered 38.8 percent of the total. The remainder was financed abroad.  </p>
<p>In 1995, Brazil's external financing needs were equivalent to 1.92 percent of GPD.</p>
<p>&quot;(The balance) is being financed by debt and short-term capital flows,&quot; Lopes told reporters, adding that &quot;2.0 percent (of GDP financing needs) are not high.&quot;</p>
<p>Total foreign capital inflows in 1996 were $79.007 billion versus $53.885 billion in 1995, the Central Bank said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Short-term portfolio investment accounted for $24.684 billion, of which $18.566 billion flowed straight back out. In 1995, portfolio investment flows amounted to $22.559 billion, with $17.806 billion in outflows.</p>
<p>Foreign borrowing by Brazilian firms and the government rose to $28.09 billion in 1996 from $15.88 billion in 1995. Lopes said the quality of Brazilian overseas borrowing increased steadily during 1996.</p>
<p>The total foreign borrowing figure includes commercial paper, securitizations, debt rollover, leasing agreements, anticipated export payments and other items.  </p>
<p>There were 366 bond issues abroad in 1996 totalling $21.6 billion versus 258 and $14.3 billion the year before.</p>
<p>Average maturities rose to 7.7 years in fourth quarter 1996 from 6.2 years in the same year-before period and average spreads narrowed to 407 basis points over U.S. Treasuries from 517 bps over, Lopes said.</p>
<p>Debt issues by the private financial sector actually fell in 1996, but the number of placements by the commercial and industrial sector jumped to 243 from 119 in 1995.</p>
