<p>Comments on Wednesday by Bulgaria's new president that his country may have to default on its debt, simply confirms what the financial markets have long warned is likely to happen, analysts said.</p>
<p>Petar Stoyanov told NATO ambassadors during a visit to Brussels that default was possible this year unless Bulgaria gets financial help from the West for its collapsing economy.</p>
<p>His remarks spooked the emerging debt market, sending the price of Bulgaria's Brady bonds sharply lower in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>&quot;(Stoyanov) is spot on...if they don't get their act together by mid-year, they won't be able to make the (debt servicing) payment in July,&quot; Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst Stuart Parkinson said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria did meet its Brady coupon payment on Tuesday for $135 million, but that gave little comfort to a market well aware that the country's currency reserves stand at close to a third of the amount it needs to service its debt this year.</p>
<p>But several analysts believe Bulgaria will eventually escape its present condition.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know default (is) a possibility. I think the IMF will stand in and help...What do they gain if they let Bulgaria go down just for a couple of hundred million dollars,&quot; Indosuez analyst Bradley Wickens said.</p>
<p>He said the market had completely over-reacted and at these levels, the debt was worth buying.</p>
<p>Bulgarian interest arrears Brady bonds (IABs) were bid at 46-3/4 cents in the dollar, down 1-3/4 points to the lowest level since late November.</p>
<p>Though long one of the market's worst performers, Bulgarian Bradys have attracted buyers hunting for high yield.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund has made clear that it will not deal with Bulgaria until it has a stable government.</p>
<p>However, after weeks of protests, the ruling Socialists are still refusing to bow to opposition demands for early elections.</p>
<p>ING Barings analyst Parvoleta Shtereva said it was noticeable that Stoyanov made his comments in Brussels.</p>
<p>The largest single maturing loan this year for Bulgaria is from the European Union, of some $200 million.</p>
<p>&quot;He is asking them in a way for a rollover,&quot; she said, adding Stoyanov was also taking the chance for a snipe at the Socialists at home.</p>
<p>Stoyanov, who took office this month, has joined opposition calls for an early election, seen as about the only chance for Bulgaria to get to work on pulling the economy out of its present plight.</p>
