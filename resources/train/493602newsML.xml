<p>Tapping good demand for emerging market debt, Mexico has placed another bond in the Samurai market, the fifth in just over a year, the government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Mexican government is continuing its policy of placing debt issues early in the year, meeting its financing needs while conditions are favourable.</p>
<p>The United Mexican States (UMS) placed the five-year 100 billion yen bond on Tuesday, saying it was consolidating its presence in the yen market.</p>
<p>The size of the issue matches the 100 billion yen issue placed last June by the UMS.</p>
<p>The latest bond, worth about $800 million, has a coupon of 3.10 percent, or the equivalent of 187 basis points over similar term U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue took place in the favourable conditions that the Samurai market offers in terms of maturities and cost in relation to other markets,&quot; the Finance Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last year, the UMS placed three yen bonds, two at six-year terms and one at 10-years. In February this year, it went to the market again to launch a seven-year yen bond.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexican bonds have been attractive. There has been good demand (in Japan), so they can return again,&quot; Santander Investment economist Hector Chavez said. &quot;And if there is good demand, better to go now.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico has only $1.4 billion of debt coming due this year, and two yen debt issues make up part of that total.</p>
<p>In November, 1995 Mexico placed a 30-billion yen issue that came due in March this year. At the same time, it placed a 10 billion two-year yen issue that comes due later this year.</p>
<p>Both issues were led by Nikko Securities, as was the latest Samurai bond placed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The federal government has been issuing large amounts of debt early this year, taking advantage of good demand, and possibly trying to duck any potential market upset tied to key mid-term elections in Mexico this year, or to rising interest rates in the United States, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;In accordance with the public debt policy followed since the start of the year, the funds coming from this operation will be used to refinance short-term debt,&quot; the Finance Ministry said.</p>
<p>Moreover, extremely low interest rates in Japan are causing investors there to look elsewhere, including to the better yielding emerging markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico is taking advantage of the record low Japanese rates: the 10-year benchmark JGB is barely yielding above 2.0 percent,&quot; MMS International noted in a market comment.</p>
<p>The issue was placed among institutional investors in Japan.</p>
