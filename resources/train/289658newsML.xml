<p>The Australian dollar cowered close to the floor of a month-old range Monday as bearish chart forces combined with poor current account data to keep trade subdued.</p>
<p>Repeated failures at US$0.7985 resistance last week and resulting sales by frustrated U.S. funds had dragged the dollar to 79 cents late Friday and that was where it remained today.</p>
<p>Sentiment was further soured by an unexpected widening in the country's trade deficit, which was all the more telling as it reflected a slackening in commodity export earnings.</p>
<p>Local bids at US$0.7890 provided a cushion for the moment but pressure was growing for a test of key US$0.7850 support.  </p>
<p>By 4.45 pm (0545 GMT) the local currency was pinned at US$0.7903/08 having slowly sagged from an early US$0.7905/10 and US$0.7915/20 late here Friday.</p>
<p>Such was the uncertainty in the local market that the trading range for the entire session was in single figures and traders here were earnestly hoping European and U.S. markets would provide some direction overnight.</p>
<p>There was more action on the crosses where its association with the dollar bloc saw it follow a strong U.S. currency up to 92.15/25 yen from 91.35/45 Friday. The U.S. dollar itself ended at 116.60/65 yen from 116.28/38 after almost touching 117.00.  </p>
<p>In trade weighted terms it was 0.2 point firmer at 59.1.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency was buoyed by the strength of Wall Street which not only promised to attract more offshore funds into U.S. equities but also increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. This was not so promising for AUD bulls since it could attract Japanese funds from A$ assets.</p>
<p>Traders said dealing rooms were tense with speculation about Japanese intentions now that the new year had started.</p>
<p>Retail investors hungry for yield had been big buyers of yen/A$ dual currency samurais last year and much of the dollar's ascent from 73 cents was credited to that demand.  </p>
<p>But domestic yields had fallen sharply in recent months as the Reserve Bank cut official rates by a total 150 basis points and no one knew if the Japanese funds would keep flowing.</p>
<p>Today's trade data had little direct bearing on domestic monetary policy but it served as a reminder of Australia's poor savings position and the need for foreign funds to finance it.</p>
<p>The current account deficit widened to A$1.923 billion in November, the largest shortfall in a year, from A$1.807 billion the month before. The deterioration was largely due to a sharp 4.9 percent drop in exports and came as a surprise to analysts who had been expecting something nearer A$1.75 billion.  </p>
<p>By far the largest part of the deficit is on net income which measures capital flows like interest payments on foreign debt. This actually narrowed to A$1.676 billion in November from A$1.910 billion in October, although these were only an estimate since relevant investment data had been delayed.</p>
<p>&quot;A deteriorating current account combined with softer commodity prices and the prospect of a further easing of monetary policy will cap the AUD in the next few months,&quot; said Hans Kunnen, chief economist at Colonial State Bank.</p>
<p>Also out was the ANZ job advertisement series which has been a reasonable leading indicator of employment trends.  </p>
<p>The measure fell 3.9 percent in December to more than wipe out a 2.1 percent rise in November leaving ads at their lowest level since January 1994.</p>
<p>If this weakness was echoed in the December labour data the market might begin to see the makings of another rate cut, but analysts noted the series had not been a good guide to monthly job volatility recently.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ANZ reckoned the December weakness had been overestimated by seasonal adjustment problems associated with the Christmas Holidays.</p>
