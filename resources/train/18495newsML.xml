<p>Angola's former rebel movement UNITA rejected on Tuesday the position of vice- president in a unity government offered to its leader Jonas Savimbi.</p>
<p>&quot;The third extraordinary congress of UNITA rejects the nomination of its president Jonas Savimbi as vice-president,'' UNITA's information secretary Marciel Dachala told a news conference in the central highlands town of Bailundo.</p>
<p>The vice-presidency, one of two in the proposed government, was offered to UNITA by Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos after he and Savimbi signed a peace accord in 1994 intended to put a final end to 20 years of bitter civil war.</p>
<p>Dachala said the week-long congress had resolved to transform UNITA into a political party without its armed wing, and with Savimbi as its leader.</p>
<p>&quot;At this moment the presence of its president (Savimbi) is needed more than ever,'' he said.</p>
<p>Loud cheers and shouting in support of the decision on the vice-presidency broke out among the 1,500 delegates invited to attend the press conference.</p>
<p>Savimbi, 62, stayed seated on the stage at the announcement, keeping a straight face.</p>
<p>Portuguese media, quoting a UNITA communique, earlier reported that UNITA had accepted the vice-presidency for the party, although not for Savimbi.</p>
<p>TSF radio also reported the congress had suggested that UNITA's chief constitutional negotiator Abel Chivukuvuku, or vice-president Antonio Tembo, take the job.</p>
<p>But Savimbi would not be drawn during questions to say who would occupy the position, or if UNITA would take up the post at all.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not here to discuss the vice-presidency...We came here to discuss the peace process so that political stability and peace can return to Angola,'' the UNITA leader told reporters.</p>
<p>Later, he said: &quot;The vice-presidency is just one of the points we came to discuss.''</p>
<p>The civil war between UNITA and dos Santos' former Marxist MPLA began after Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
<p>The two sides signed their peace pact in November 1994, agreeing to integrate their armies into a single national military force and proposing the unity government.</p>
<p>But implementation of the deal has been slowed by lingering suspicions. About 6,500 United Nations troops, costing over $1 million a day, have been helping to implement the plan, especially the disarming of UNITA's fighters at assembly camps.</p>
<p>Savimbi said he wanted to play a vital role in restoring stability to his country.</p>
<p>&quot;I have said that President dos Santos is the president of Angola and therefore he is my president. But that does not mean necessarily that he has to give me a job.</p>
<p>&quot;I can play an important role in bringing about peace and stability in Angola. I am prepared to play that role alongside the president (dos Santos) and with other opposition parties,'' Savimbi said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>A government delegation will travel to Bailundo on Thursday to meet Savimbi to discuss a date for a meeting between Savimbi and dos Santos. The government has proposed that the talks take place on September 15.</p>
