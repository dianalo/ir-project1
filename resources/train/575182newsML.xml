<headline>Paxson to acquire ITT/Dow Jones TV station.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Paxson Communications Corp said Monday it has agreed to acquire WBIS+, Channel 31 in New York City, from a partnership of Dow Jones Inc and ITT Corp in a transaction valued at $257.5 million.</p>
<p>In a joint release, the sellers said the purchase price represents a gain on their total investment in the station, which they purchased from the city of New York in 1996 for $207 million.</p>
<p>Prior to the expected fourth quarter closing, Paxson said, it will operate the station pursuant to a time brokerage agreement starting June 30.  </p>
<p>The sellers said the agreement is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to be received later this year.  The transaction is not subject to financing conditions, they noted.</p>
<p>Paxson chief executive Lowell W. Paxson said &quot;TV-31 in New York City becomes our 50th TV Station and the Flagship station of our proposed new nationwide broadcast TV network.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same time Paxson begins providing programming to TV-31 it will change the call letters of the station to WPXN, the company said.  </p>
<p>Paxson told reporters the new station would continue to carry the sports programming being provided by Liberty/Fox Sports -- a venture of News Corp Ltd and Liberty Media Corp -- which involves 21 hours a week of sporting events and news.</p>
<p>During the period before the proposed new nationwide network commences operations later this year, Paxson said WPXN TV-31 will offer to sell air time to a variety of ethnic, foreign language, religious, cable and specialty programmers as well as infomercial entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The company said discussions continue with the major broadcast television networks, Hollywood television and movies studios, television programming syndicators and cable network programmers, concerning the use of its nationwide, broadcast television station group of 50 full power TV station properties covering over 57 percent of all U.S. TV households.</p>
