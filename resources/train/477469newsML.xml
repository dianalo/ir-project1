<title>USA: WHX begins tender offer for Dynamics Corp.</title>
<headline>WHX begins tender offer for Dynamics Corp.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>WHX Corp. said Monday it began a cash tender offer for the stock of Dynamics Corp. of America at $40 apiece to increase its stake in the appliance and equipment manufacturer to 19.9 percent.</p>
<p>WHX, which already owns 109,600 Dynamics shares, said its tender offer is for up to 649,000 shares.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker said it would buy fewer shares if Dynamics amends its &quot;poison pill&quot; anti-takeover defence trigger to below 20 percent.</p>
<p>Dynamics' stock jumped $4 to $37.125, while WHX was unchanged at $7 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-morning.</p>
<p>WHX said that late last week it sent a letter to Dynamics proposing a cash merger at $40 per share, or a total of about $160 million. In that proposal, WHX said it was prepared to raise its offer if Dynamics could prove that it was worth more.</p>
<p>The offer expires on April 29, it said.</p>
<p>WHX said the offer is not subject to any minimum number of shares being tendered or to financing. As of Dec. 31, it said it had more than $400 million of available cash and cash equivalents.</p>
<p>Dynamics, based in Greenwich, Conn., makes a variety of electrical appliances and electronic devices, fabricated metal products and equipment, and power and controlled environmental systems.</p>
