<p>Australia's republican debate has resurfaced as a major political issue -- and a possible early election trigger -- after being pushed to the backburner by the conservatives' election win last year.</p>
<p>A poll on Wednesday showed pro-republican sentiment firming again after dipping following the landslide victory of avowed monarchist John Howard over the Labor administration of republican crusader Paul Keating.</p>
<p>The survey in the national daily, the Australian, showed support for this former British colony ditching Queen Elizabeth as head of state and becoming a republic bouncing back to 49 percent -- around the levels under Keating -- after dropping to the mid-40s in the months after Howard's win.</p>
<p>Only 30 percent opposed a republic, up two points on the Australian's last poll four months ago but more than 10 percent down on separate polls a year ago.</p>
<p>After a year of relative obscurity, the emotive republican debate has been revived by political brawling over how to elect delegates for a national summit on the issue, originally planned for late this year.</p>
<p>Howard's Liberal-National coalition has postponed the convention after leftist opposition parties in parliament's upper house, the Senate, forced changes to how delegates would be elected under legislation setting up the summit.</p>
<p>Half of the 152 delegates will be elected and the government wants them chosen by a voluntary postal vote. But the Labor opposition and Australian Democrats want a compulsory, personal-attendance ballot, like all other elections.</p>
<p>The remaining 76 delegates would be appointed by the government, and would include Howard and several of his key ministers.</p>
<p>Howard has threatened an early election over the Labor-Democrats stand, which the constitution allows if the Senate again overturns the government bill.</p>
<p>Labor and the Democrats have also threatened to bypass the convention and push for a national popular vote on the republican issue, although Howard's overwhelming lower house majority makes that unlikely.</p>
<p>Howard said last week he remained committed to holding the convention, despite his own public opposition to this nation of 18 million people becoming a republic.</p>
<p>Although Australia is independent, its constitution was passed as an act of the British parliament and its head of state is the ruling British monarch, not an Australian.</p>
<p>Keating launched his push to sever Australia's remaining constitutional ties with Britain by the centenary of statehood in 2001, after he became prime minister in 1991.</p>
<p>He enraged local monarchists and the British media by telling Queen Elizabeth during a 1993 official visit to Britain that Australians no longer wanted her as their head of state.</p>
<p>After Keating quit politics following Labor's ousting, official rhetoric faded and the public debate lost its momentum as politicians and public focused on economic issues.</p>
