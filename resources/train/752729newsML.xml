<p>Colombia's urban unemployment rate rose to 13.6 percent in the April to June period, one of its highest levels in the last decade, the government's National Statistics Department said Thursday.</p>
<p>The rate has risen from 11.4 percent in the same period in 1996 and is up from the 12.7 percent rate of urban unemployment recorded in the first quarter this year.  </p>
<p>The statistics department said a total of 865,004 people were out of work at the end of June compared to 6.38 million people at jobs. More than 44 percent of the workforce was based in the capital Bogota, according to the statistics department.</p>
<p>In the April to June period, 53,408 people found employment, while 98,209 people who had jobs in March lost them by the end of June.  </p>
<p>The highest rate of unemployment was in the southwestern city of Cali, Colombia's second largest city, where 18.8 percent of the workforce was out of work, compared to a jobless rate of 17.4 percent at the end of March.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate in Medellin dropped back to 15.9 percent in the second quarter compared to 16.4 percent at the end of March.</p>
<p>Bogota, meanwhile, continued to have the lowest rate of joblessness of Colombia's seven largest cities with 11.5 percent.  </p>
<p>The statistics department gave little explanation for the rise in joblessness, saying simply that more people were looking for work.</p>
<p>It offered no assessment of rural unemployment, but economic analysts estimate it is roughly double the urban rate.</p>
