<p>Tax administrators from 45 Commonwealth countries began a meeting in Harare on Monday to discuss ways of harnessing modern technology to improve the efficiency of tax collection in their countries.</p>
<p>Conference chairman, Gerry Cook of the United Kingdom's Inland Revenue said most tax administrations in the world were computerising and Commonwealth countries -- many of whom suffered shortages of qualified and skilled staff -- were also looking at automation to improve tax collection systems.</p>
<p>&quot;Technology is a big issue of discussion at the conference and most of the tax administrations in the Commonwealth are introducing computers, automation to improve collections.</p>
<p>&quot;Using computers ensures a very quick turnaround of tax assessments and means big savings in the cost of running the tax administration,&quot; Cook told Reuters.</p>
<p>In a speech read at the opening of the three-day conference, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said most Commonwealth countries were failing to take full advantage of available technology to improve their tax administrations.</p>
<p>&quot;In a world that is fast becoming a global village, it is the strength and capacity of tax administration that can make or break the desired economic and social being of a nation,&quot; Murerwa said in the speech read by his deputy, Patrick Chinamasa.</p>
<p>&quot;It is therefore important for tax administrators to be kept abreast of the developments in business practices and technological advancement, lest they fall prey to gullible and smart tax evaders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Zimbabwe was taking steps to make its tax administration more efficient and effective. He said it was restructuring its tax administration departments to bring them under a semi-autonomous revenue authority.</p>
<p>&quot;With the liberalisation of our economy, strengthening of the tax administration capacity has and remains high on our agenda,&quot; he said.</p>
