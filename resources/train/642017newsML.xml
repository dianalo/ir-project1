<title>BELGIUM: OLOs tread water as investors stay sidelined.</title>
<headline>OLOs tread water as investors stay sidelined.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-06-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Belgian linear bonds trod water in early Thursday trading and were seen in tight ranges ahead of Friday's U.S. May jobs report.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were virtually no end investors to animate the market, as most preferred to wait for direction from the United States.</p>
<p>Five-year paper was relatively well bid, dealers said, but trade was very thin across the board with just 114 lots traded in the front-month OLO future, which was down one bp at 121.14.</p>
<p>The 2007 OLO yielded 5.92 percent, from 5.91 Wednesday, and the spread over Bunds  MEUR was an unchanged eight bps.  </p>
<p>Dealers also reported some repositioning trades ahead of Tuesday's OLO exchange auction, where the Treasury is offering OLO lines 27 (4.00 pct, Jan 2000), 10 (8.75 pct, June 2002), 20 (7.75 pct, Oct 2004) and 26 (6.25 pct March 2007) against OLO 8 (9.25 pct, Aug 1997) and 4 (9.25 pct, Jan 98).</p>
