<p>Former finance minister P. Chidambaram's Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) on Sunday authorised its leader, G.K. Moopanar, to decide whether the regional party should join India's new government.</p>
<p>The TMC, part of the centre-left United Front coalition, decided on April 19 to stay out of the government after the alliance chose Inder Kumar Gujral instead of Moopanar as its leader and new prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;The executive committee unanimously decided to authorise party president G.K. Moopanar to take a decision, taking into consideration national interest and the political future of the TMC in Tamil Nadu,&quot; party spokesman S. Gnanadesikan told reporters in the southern city of Madras.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect Mr.Moopanar to take a decision in a day or two,&quot; the party general secretary, Jayanthi Natarajan, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is quite complex and the feelings were running quite high during the meeting. It is not a simple decision to take,&quot; Natarajan said.</p>
<p>The TMC's decision was keenly awaited by investors as Chidambaram is a key economic reformer who presented a tax-cutting budget for 1997/98 (April-March) on February 28.</p>
<p>Gujral has not appointed a finance minister in his cabinet, signalling the slot was open for Chidambaram. The budget has yet to win parliamentary approval.</p>
<p>Party officials said TMC legislators in the Tamil Nadu assembly as well as district chiefs pressed Moopanar at Sunday's meeting to keep the regional party out of Gujral's government. The executive welcomed the earlier decision to stay out.</p>
<p>Party leaders argued that joining Gujral's government would limit the TMC's options in competing with the state's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), also a part of the alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;Eighty percent were against joining the government. Their arguments were based on Tamil Nadu politics,&quot; a TMC leader said.</p>
<p>During the prime ministerial race, the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) pushed for a prime minister from northern India, saying there was a need to check the rival Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in its stronghold.</p>
<p>Analysts and newspapers saw this as a move to check Moopanar because of his closeness to the Congress party.</p>
<p>The TMC was formed last year by Congress defectors upset with their leadership over a regional electoral alliance.</p>
<p>It has 20 of the 177 alliance lawmakers in the 545-member lower house, the Lok Sabha, while The CPI-M has 32. Neither of them is represented in the government.</p>
<p>Gujral became prime minister after the United Front agreed to replace its leader, H.D. Deve Gowda, in order to win back vital support from the Congress. The Congress offered backing last year to keep out the Hindu BJP.</p>
