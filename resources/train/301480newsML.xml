<p>Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff and Marco Branca were both on target as Inter Milan won 2-1 at Napoli on Sunday to close to within two points of leaders Juventus, held 0-0 at home to Atalanta.</p>
<p>Inter are now second in serie A with 28 points from 16 matches, two adrift of Juventus who enjoyed a six-point advantage at the start of the year.</p>
<p>The European champions, who lost Alen Boksic to injury midway through the first-half, were lucky to escape with a point against Atalanta for whom Gianluigi Lentini hit the post.</p>
<p>Sampdoria will join Inter in second-place if they can beat Cagliari in their match later on Sunday.</p>
<p>Early season pacesetters Vicenza dropped to third on 26 points after losing 1-0 to crisi-hit Milan at the San Siro, the champion's first win in three matches. It took Milan into sixth place on 24 points.</p>
