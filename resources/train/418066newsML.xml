<headline>NYMEX electricity near months up amid outages.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX electricity futures contracts for April and May moved higher amid planned and unplanned power plant outages in the West, while forward contracts were little changed.</p>
<p>&quot;There are quite a few outages which are pushing up PV (Palo Verde), which in turn is pushing up COB (California-Oregon border),&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is still pretty boring out there,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>As of 1250 EST, April COB was last 20 cents at $9.75 per megawatt hour (MWh), while May was up 15 cents at $9.90.</p>
<p>PV for April was up 45 cents at $13.60, while May was up 35 cents at $13.60.</p>
<p>Although a series of storms could plague the Northwest into the weekend, the region was expected to see near normal temperatures through Wednesday before cooling to two to four degrees F below normal.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, readings were expected to run four to eight degrees above normal for the next couple of days.</p>
<p>The outage of the 1,070 megawatt (MW) San Onofre nuclear unit 2 in southern California was extended due to discovery of a pressurizer leak on Monday.</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the unit was now expected to restart March 13, but a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co said a timeframe for further repairs remained uncertain.</p>
<p>The San Onofre unit has been shut since November 30 for refueling and assorted repair work and the plant's 1,080 MW unit 1 is due to start a refueling outage April 5.</p>
<p>Other plant outages in the Southwest include the 1,221 MW Palo Verde 3 nuclear unit, the 750 MW Navajo coal-fired unit, a 750 MW unit at the Mohave coal-fired plant and a 300 MW coal-fired unit at the Reid Gardner plant in Nevada.</p>
<p>In addition, the 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear unit in Washington was expected to ramp down Wednesday night for an extended refueling outage due to last until early July.</p>
