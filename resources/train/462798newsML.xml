<p>Coverage of religious events went up last year on major television network news programs, but overall, religion gets little air time, according to a study released on Monday.</p>
<p>The Media Research Center said that during the last four years that it has been monitoring coverage of religion, few television reports have been about religion.</p>
<p>It said that from 1993 to 1996, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and PBS have presented roughly 72,000 evening news programs and some 104,000 morning show segment.</p>
<p>On the evening news, only 955 stories were devoted to religion, or about 1.3 percent. Religion news made up just 0.8 percent of the morning coverage, the study said.</p>
<p>In 1996, coverage of religious events went up 8 percent in the evening to 269 from 249 in 1995, the study said. Morning coverage of religion went up 15 percent in 1996 to 258 from 224 in 1995.</p>
<p>The center, a conservative organization that monitors television and news coverage, said that among the networks only ABC has a religion beat reporter. ABC led coverage of religious events in the evening last year, but NBC had the most segments in the morning, it said.</p>
<p>Most of the religious coverage involved matters dealing with Catholics. Some reports, dealing with such things as events in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland, were not included in the study as religious coverage but were considered political events.</p>
