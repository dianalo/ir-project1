<p>Eastern Europe's frontrunners in the race to EU membership see monetary union as their long-term goal, while the impact on the region of the euro currency's 1999 launch is seen as too limited to keep bankers awake at night.</p>
<p>Officials in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic believe the initial effect, if any, of the single European currency on their economies is likely to be positive in the short run.</p>
<p>Hungary and Poland have signalled that in their efforts to join the European Union they will seek to meet the stringent criteria for entry into the European Monetary Union (EMU) as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Slovenia has indicated that it regards the EMU criteria as a benchmark of economic achievement.</p>
<p>In Russia, due to continue its current policy of keeping the rouble in an exchange rate corridor gradually devalued against the dollar, the perspective of a new euro currency seems too distant to provoke serious debate.</p>
<p>This is still more true for Bulgaria and Romania as the first is struggling with hyperinflation and the second expects inflation to rebound to 45 percent this year following a loosening of fiscal and monetary policy.</p>
<p>EURO'S LAUNCH TO BRING BENEFITS, TECHNICAL CHANGES</p>
<p>Bankers and government officials in countries associated with the EU say the euro's launch will force some adjustments in their exchange rate and reserve policies, but these will be mere technicalities compared with the problems the &quot;in&quot; countries will have to deal with.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point I do not see how it could negatively affect us. Certainly the countries which will end up within the system will have many more problems,&quot; said Krzysztof Barburski, deputy president of the National Bank of Poland.</p>
<p>His Hungarian counterpart Gyorgy Szapary told Reuters the replacement of several national currencies by the euro should help Hungarian companies by limiting the exchange rate risk in trade with the EU, Eastern Europe's main partner.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be one exchange rate risk instead of many,&quot; he said, adding that Hungary expected the euro to help reduce interest rates in western Europe, which would also ease Hungary's position as a borrower.</p>
<p>Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, which either fix or gradually devalue their currencies against baskets of foreign units, expect the euro to replace some currencies in these baskets or to serve by itself as a single yardstick.</p>
<p>Josef Tosovsky, president of the Czech central bank, said early this year the introduction of the euro would fix the crown to the euro rather than the present currency basket, made up 65 percent of marks and 35 percent of the dollar.</p>
<p>Since then there has been little public discussion of the EMU's impact.</p>
<p>Poland's Barburski said that if the crawling devaluation of the zloty against a basket of five currencies continues until the launch of the euro, the new unit would replace the mark which makes up 35 percent of the basket and possibly the French franc and the British pound, which together account for 15 percent.</p>
<p>Barburski said however that he believed the dollar, which makes up 45 percent of Poland's basket, would maintain its role as the global reserve and settlement currency.</p>
<p>Bankers expect the euro to assume the same or even a more important role than the mark as a reserve currency, as it would embrace not only the mark, but also other currencies now held by central banks.</p>
<p>Hungary's Szapary said the euro could become a peg for the forint, replacing a basket now made up of the dollar and the mark, once the country's inflation falls to single digit levels.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can bring inflation...to below 10 percent, then we can shift towards a fixed exchange rate or flotation in a wider range. We are going in that direction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>FRONTRUNNERS FOR EU SET VARIED TARGETS FOR EMU ENTRY</p>
<p>Szapary said Hungary, which now aims for a budget deficit of four percent of GDP and expects inflation this year of 23-24 percent, hoped to join the EU by 2001 or 2002 and EMU soon after that.</p>
<p>The finance ministry has been more cautious, putting the possible EMU entry date at around 2005.</p>
<p>Slovenia is also upbeat about its chances of meeting all EMU criteria by 2001.</p>
<p>In October Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek said the country stood a chance of cutting inflation to three percent from the current nine percent within the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Poland, which now meets two of the three EMU criteria with a budget deficit planned to be 2.8 percent in 1997, below the three percent cap, and public debt below the maximum permitted 60 percent of GDP, believes its last task is the toughest.</p>
<p>Inflation, now at about 19 percent, is still far from the target of about three percent.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said this month he would soon unveil a plan called Euro 2006, which would aim, among other adjustments, at slashing inflation to two percent by 2004.</p>
<p>&quot;We meet two criteria, but we have a long way to go when it comes to inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate...We have an ambitious goal of slashing inflation to five percent by 2000 but lowering it further will be harder,&quot; Kolodko said.</p>
<p>He told reporters he would soon present details of his plan to trigger a vital public debate on costs and the benefits of Poland's entry to the EU and later to monetary union.</p>
