<title>TANZANIA: Rwanda tribunal to begin joint genocide trial.</title>

<p>A U.N. tribunal said on Wednesday it would begin a joint trial next week of two Rwandans accused of genocide and crimes against humanity in the killings of thousands of minority Tutsis in 1994.</p>
<p>The international tribunal at Arusha said the trial of Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana would start on April 9.</p>
<p>Both are accused of organising massacres in Rwanda's western Bisesero district during the mass killings of an estimated 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus by soldiers, militiamen and mobs. They have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>At the time Ruzindana, 38, was a businessman while Kayishema, 43, was prefect of Kibuye -- the most senior local official. The tribunal did not make it clear whether they are Hutus or Tutsis.</p>
<p>The genocide trial of a Hutu militia leader, George Rutaganda, was adjourned until May 27 to allow the joint trial to begin. His trial, which started in March, was the second to open at the tribunal.</p>
<p>Rwanda, which is holding its own genocide trials, has criticised the international tribunal for moving too slowly and for not being able to bring the biggest ringleaders to trial.</p>
