<p>Ireland's economic growth rate is likely to be double that of its main trading partners over the next few years, Ulster Bank economist Eoin Fahy said on Monday.</p>
<p>In addition, interest rates will remain low by the standards of the last 20 years, while inflation should not be significantly higher than the &quot;core' European average,&quot; National Wesminster Bank's Irish unit, Ulster Bank, said in a note.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for the Irish economy over the next few years remains very positive, with growth likely to continue running at levels more than double those of our main trading partners,&quot; Fahy said.  </p>
<p>Growth averaged almost 8.0 percent over the last three years compared with an OECD average of less than 2.5 percent over the long-term, he said.</p>
<p>The nature of Irish growth was broad-based, he said, with consumer spending up about 4.0 percent in volume terms, strong investment spending helped by substantial transfers from the EU budget and steady export growth of around 13 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The working assumption of our forecast is that EMU will go ahead around the turn of the century. On that basis, it appears that we can expect to see a generally low level of interest rates over the next few years,&quot; Fahy said.  </p>
<p>He said in the short term, interest rates may have to rise a little as the Central Bank reacts to high levels of growth and house price increases, but the long-term case for low interest rates remains intact.</p>
<p>Fahy said it was hard to see where a negative shock to the economy could come from and therefore although he considered fiscal policy &quot;not ideal' it was unlikely to prove a real problem.</p>
