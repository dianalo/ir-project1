<p>The takeover declaration has been made, but follow-up action in Rhone-Poulenc's $4.3 billion bid for full control of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc has given way to an eerie silence.</p>
<p>&quot;No timetable has been set, no meetings planned,&quot; said a spokesman for the U.S.-based pharmaceuticals group in which the French chemicals company has a 68.3 percent stake.</p>
<p>A special committee made up of three independent directors has been formed to evaluate the Rhone-Poulenc offer. But at Rhone-Poulenc there is no board meeting scheduled until September.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc said in June that it wanted to have full control of the U.S. company, an announcement which did not really surprise any industry observers.</p>
<p>The French group is all but running the show at Rorer but was bound by a 1990 standstill agreement not to raise its stake until after July 31, 1997.</p>
<p>The business combination of Rhone-Poulenc, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and the Pasteur Merieux Connaught vaccines group would constitute one of the world's leading drugs groups and a leader in animal and plant health.</p>
<p>The move is a key part of the strategy of Rhone-Poulenc chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou to turn Rhone-Poulenc from a French chemicals company into a leading life sciences group.</p>
<p>The other part of his plan involves a demerger of the chemicals and fibres business into a separate company in which a minority stake will be floated in 1998.</p>
<p>The former management consultant is taking a leaf from the books of Imperial Chemical Industries Plc, which split into ICI and Zeneca Group Plc in 1993, and the 1995 demerger of Switzerland's Sandoz AG  SANZ.S and Clariant AG. Fourtou, who took over at Rhone-Poulenc in 1986 when the group was still state-owned, oversaw the 1990 purchase of the Rorer stake, the 1993 privatisation and the 1995 bid for Fisons.</p>
<p>At 58, Fourtou is still far from retirement but he might be tempted to hand over the reins once he has overseen the company's transformation.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer chairman Michel de Rosen, 46, and Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, 46, who will head the chemicals and fibres company, could both be candidates for succession.</p>
<p>Tirouflet was until recently the finance director of Rhone-Poulenc but he relinquished these duties to Patrick Langlois of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p>
<p>Igor Landau, Rhone-Poulenc managing director, told Reuters in June that the French group would not make a further move without talking to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and until after the special committee reports back to the board.</p>
<p>With 68.3 percent of the outstanding votes at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer the French group has a majority but no absolute power.</p>
<p>Even if the executive management at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, almost all issued from the French parent group, is likely to support integration with Rhone-Poulenc, they have to provide assurances that the interests of minority shareholders are properly protected.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons the special committee of independent directors has been given full powers to act on behalf of the company.</p>
<p>Fourtou indicated in June that Rhone would be willing to bid $92 per share for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, which was trading at $79 when the buyout plan was announced on June 26. On Wednesday, the share was trading at $95 with some analysts expecting Rhone to be forced to pay more.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc had planned a seven billion franc ($1.1 billion) capital increase to pay for the Rorer purchase and financial analysts said this amount may have to rise if the price needs to be increased.</p>
