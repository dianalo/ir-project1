<p>The international insurance industry still faces a considerable amount of uncertainty over tobacco-related liability, even though insurers were not asked to contribute directly to last week's historic settlement in the United States.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, tobacco companies agreed to pay 80 percent of any proceeds they receive from their insurers to the states.</p>
<p>In return, the state of Louisiana agreed to drop its lawsuit against insurers seeking to recover medical costs related the harmful effects of smoking.</p>
<p>The deal leaves tobacco companies free to pursue claims with their insurers, but it was unclear whether the arrangement gives them enough incentive to do so, attorneys and analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>But the deal appears to do nothing to discourage third parties that may get sued, such as retailers and advertisers, from seeking insurance coverage under their policies, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The way the settlement is structured now, there's more incentive for the third parties to go after the insurance than the tobacco companies,&quot; said Robert Carter, a policyholder attorney with Washington D.C. law firm McKenna &amp; Cuneo.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the important point is, the asset is not going to go untapped,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Even so, insurers were spared from having to make any immediate, upfront payment in the tobacco settlement itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We really didn't think there was a lot of exposure to the insurance industry,&quot; Standard &amp; Poor's managing director Alan Levin said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say this settlement has confirmed that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, the settlement appears to discourage tobacco companies from spending a lot of time and money fighting their insurers for coverage, if they then must give 80 percent of the proceeds to the states.</p>
<p>&quot;There's almost a disincentive here to go after insurance monies,&quot; Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Smith said, reached on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Why bother? Why endanger your existing relationship with your insurers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Levin agreed, saying &quot;I would think this would signficantly put a damper on the interest of the tobacco companies to try to get some payment from their insurers.&quot;</p>
<p>If the tobacco companies were allowed to apply that 80 percent to pay down their settlement obligations to the states, that might be a different story, they said.</p>
<p>That would be &quot;a great inducement for the manufacturers to recover monies from the insurer,&quot; said Michael Flaharty, a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand's New York-based national claims consulting practice.</p>
<p>Louisiana attorney general Richard Ieyoub was not available for further comment on Sunday.</p>
<p>But on Friday, his office said any insurance proceeds from the tobacco companies would be in addition to the nearly $370 billion they had agreed to pay in the settlement.</p>
<p>And yet, that 20 percent could still add up to a lot of money, other attorneys and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty percent is better than nothing,&quot; Lehman analyst Peter Wade said.</p>
<p>And some insurance policies could provide hundreds of millions of dollars worth of coverage, said Kirk Pasich, a policyholder attorney with the Los Angeles-based law firm Troop, Meisinger, Steuber and Pasich.</p>
<p>And &quot;20 percent of $100 million, $200 million, $1 billion, $10 billion -- that's a lot of pocket change,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So I think there's still a financial incentive there to recover,&quot; he said. &quot;And the question is, under how many policies can you recover,&quot; he said. &quot;How far forward in time, how close to the present can you get.&quot;</p>
<p>Wade agreed saying tobacco companies in need of cash will try to tap their insurance.</p>
<p>&quot;I still don't think think it's a done deal that the insurers don't get directly impacted by the tobacco companies and their wholesale distributors,&quot; Wade said.</p>
<p>&quot;I just think it's a matter of time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But insurers would almost certainly fight vigorously against any tobacco-related claims.</p>
<p>Insurers argue that policies sold to tobacco companies after the mid-1960s specifically exclude payment for tobacco-related claims.</p>
<p>In addition, they say there are strong arguments to deny coverage on other claims as well.</p>
<p>But even if the courts ruled against the insurers in these cases, it would be several years, at least, before insurers would begin to feel the impact of any such litigation on their bottom line, Wade said.</p>
<p>With the potential for liability still so unclear and relatively far off, insurance stocks are likely to remain unaffected by this issue in the near-term, he said.</p>
<p>But insurers with the greatest potential for losses from tobacco litigation are the same ones that were hit the hardest by the asbestos and environmental liabilities, he said.</p>
<p>They include the large commercial general liability insurers such as Travelers Property Casualty Corp, CNA Financial Corp, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc, St. Paul Cos Inc, and Chubb Corp.</p>
<p>Foreign insurers that own large U.S. commercial insurers, such as Zurich Insurance Co, also could have some exposure to tobacco-related losses.</p>
<p>In addition, the big reinsurers such as Munich Reinsurance (Muenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft ), Swiss Reinsurance Co, General Re Corp and General Electric Co's Employers Re also could have some tobacco liability, he said.</p>
<p>But foreign insurers are less likely to bear the brunt of any tobacco liability.</p>
<p>&quot;I think most of exposure is here in the States,&quot; Wade said.</p>
