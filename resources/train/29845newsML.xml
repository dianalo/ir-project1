<p>Connecticut Gov. John Rowland said Tuesday the state ended the 1995-96 fiscal year with a surplus of about $250 million, largely due to his Administration's spending cuts and efforts to aid business.</p>
<p>Saying he intended to press for more spending cuts and tax reductions in the next budget, which is due in February, the governor added that about $160.5 million of last year's surplus will be deposited in the state's Rainy Day Fund.  </p>
<p>Including this deposit, that brings the balance in the stabilization fund to $241 million, according to the governor's prepared remarks.</p>
<p>This is the second year in a row that the state has sent monies to the Rainy Day Fund since the 1986-87 fiscal year, when such deposits temporarily ceased, he said, adding his Administration cut spending by $89 million in its first six months. The Republican governor took office in January 1995.</p>
<p>About $89.5 million of the approximately $250 million surplus for the 1996 fiscal year will be used to repay debt incurred in 1991.</p>
<p>The 1996 surplus is more than three times the size of the $80.5 million sum with which the state ended the 1995 fiscal year, Rowland said, promising further efforts to rein in spending.</p>
<p>&quot;To sustain our state's economic growth, we must continue to budget responsibly, and implement more spending cuts and tax reductions,&quot; he added.</p>
