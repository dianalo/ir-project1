<p>Australia was prepared to use its military to maintain essential services during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney if needed, Defence Minister Ian McLachlan said on Sunday.</p>
<p>McLachlan said using troops to replace civilian workers, if workers became embroiled in a labour row, should only be a last resort in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) it is possible that during the Olympics there might be a circumstance where the people running the Olympic Games decide that they need ... the defence force,&quot; McLachlan said in a television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We're planning for, preparing if you like, to make sure that if we are needed, we're there in the year 2000. But we hope that won't happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Australia, where the union-backed Labor Party is one of the two dominant political blocs, has rarely used troops to solve industrial disputes.</p>
<p>The last time troops were used was in 1989, when the then-Labor government used Royal Australian Air Force planes and personnel to operate civilian services to help end a crippling strike by commercial pilots.</p>
<p>The conservative Liberal-National government has been urged by some quarters to use the military to replace striking mineworkers to end a costly labour row in the Hunter Valley.</p>
<p>But McLachlan said the government had no such plans at this stage.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a sort of essential part of democracy -- once you break that, you start to lose the essential bits of democracy,&quot; he said.</p>
