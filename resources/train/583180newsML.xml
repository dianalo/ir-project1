<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-05-14</dateline>

<p>India on Wednesday accused Pakistan of aiding the abductors of four Western tourists kidnapped nearly two years ago in Kashmir, and said New Delhi had sought Islamabad's help in securing their release.</p>
<p>Junior Personnel Minister S.R. Balasubramoniyan told parliament the government was aware of statements by the hostages' relatives that Pakistan knew the abductors.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has, through diplomatic channels, consistently been urging the Pakistani authorities to help in securing the release of the hostages, since the group responsible for the abduction and hostage-taking of the foreign nationals is based in and operates out of that country and is receiving active assistance from the Pakistani agencies,&quot; he said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan, American Donald Hutchings and German Dirk Hasert were abducted while trekking in India's Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir in July 1995 by a previously unknown guerrilla group, Al-Faran.</p>
<p>The four have not been sighted for several months, raising doubts about whether they are still alive. Al-Faran beheaded a fifth hostage, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, in August 1995.</p>
<p>Indian authorities and the hostages' relatives have repeatedly said that Al-Faran is backed by the Pakistan-based Harkat-ul-Ansar militant group. Harkat-ul-Ansar has denied any links with Al-Faran.</p>
<p>India accuses Pakistan of arming and training guerrillas in Kashmir, where police and hospitals say more than 20,000 people have died since a separatist insurgency erupted in 1990.</p>
<p>Islamabad says it provides only moral and diplomatic support to the rebels, some of whom are fighting for independence and others for merger with neighbouring Pakistan.</p>
<p>India controls two-thirds of Kashmir while Pakistan rules the rest. Both nations claim the entire territory, and have fought two wars over the region since 1947.</p>
