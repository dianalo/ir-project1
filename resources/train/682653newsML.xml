<p>A leading military expert accused President Boris Yeltsin of Tuesday of ruining Russia's armed forces and said the country risked losing all its territory east of the Urals as a result.</p>
<p>In an open address to Yeltsin, General Lev Rokhlin, who heads the parliamentary defence committee, said the president and commander-in-chief had &quot;done nothing over the past six years for the country's military security&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;You have condemned the armed forces to eventual ruin,&quot; said Rokhlin, who won wide respect for his role in Russia's ill-fated military campaign in breakaway Chechnya.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reply from the Kremlin to his attack.</p>
<p>Rokhlin sits as a deputy in the State Duma lower house of parliament for the usually pro-government Our Home is Russia party headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>But he has become increasingly critical of the Kremlin's military policy.</p>
<p>Moscow's once proud military machine has decayed from chronic money shortages since the 1991 collapse of Soviet communism. Officers often go months without pay and underfed conscripts have been reduced to begging in the streets. Suicides, thefts and bullying of young recruits by senior officers have become commonplace.</p>
<p>Political wrangling has delayed urgent reforms that would cut bureaucratic waste, target spending on priority areas and over the long term transform the ramshackle conscript-based forces into a leaner, modern professional army.</p>
<p>Echoing an old nationalist obsession, Rokhlin said Washington and its allies aimed to break Russia up into petty fiefdoms easily dictated to from outside.</p>
<p>But the danger was not confined to the West, he added.</p>
<p>China's ascendancy in the Asian-Pacific region posed a long-term threat to Russia's sparsely populated, resource-rich eastern territories, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;With your (Yeltsin's) attitude to national defence in the first 20 years of the next millenium Russia could lose its Far East region and Siberia right up to the Urals.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ural mountains separate European and Asian Russia.</p>
<p>His statement was also addressed to officers, whom he urged to fight government plans to scale down the military.</p>
<p>&quot;Organise yourselves, promote leaders to preside over officers' gatherings, demand your legal rights,&quot; he said in the address, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has said he wants the armed forces to be cut to 1.2 million from about 1.8 million men now.</p>
<p>Even generals concede they are not sure of the exact troop figure now, making it hard to assess progress on previous plans to cut 200,000 men this year.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, General Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the general staff and number two in Russia's defence hierarchy, said it should aim to reach 1.2 million by January 1999.</p>
<p>Rokhlin said the planned reduction would be acceptable if accompanied by a broad assessment of the country's strategic and military requirements.</p>
<p>But he said it was driven rather by a short-term need to save money regardless of other priorities.</p>
<p>Despite the end of the Cold War many threats remain to Russia's national security, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States is doing everything to draw the countries of (the former Soviet Union) away from Russia,&quot; he said, citing closer U.S. ties with Ukraine, the Baltic republics and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>He said Yeltsin's failure to halt NATO's eastward expansion had sealed the failure of his foreign policy.</p>
<p>The Kremlin opposes the alliance's plans later this year to admit several former Warsaw Pact countries in eastern Europe but has been powerless to stop the process.</p>
<p>Last month Yeltsin signed a charter in Paris enshrining Moscow's new relations with NATO but his nationalist foes at home said this betrayed Russian national interests.</p>
