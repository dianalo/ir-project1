<title>UK: London gold slips to fix at lowest since Jan 1995.</title>
<headline>London gold slips to fix at lowest since Jan 1995.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold was fixed at $373.50 per ounce on Tuesday afternoon, down a dollar from the morning fixing and its lowest fix since January 9, 1995.</p>
<p>The market has been under pressure since late last week, which accelerated following a sharp sell-off by speculators in New York on Monday.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it's going to stabilise around here in the short term. It should hold technically in the $372-$375 area,&quot; a London-based dealer said.</p>
<p>Market sentiment was overwhelmingly bearish as investors shunned gold in favour of surging equities markets, and physical demand remained lower than expected.</p>
<p>Fears over the prospect of gold sales by miners and European central banks were also helping depress the price, dealers said.</p>
