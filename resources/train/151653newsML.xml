<p>A sharp reverse on Wall Street overnight and jitters over interest rates weakened European stock markets on Tuesday, prompting morning losses that exceeded one percent in some cases.</p>
<p>The recently buoyant dollar also lost some gloss after Germany's top economic research institutes said a slight monetary tightening was possible.</p>
<p>But market analysts said investors were unlikely to be too bold ahead of a run of U.S. economic statistics this week.</p>
<p>The latest readings on the health of the world's biggest economy start with third-quarter employment cost data at 1330 GMT and consumer confidence figures at 1500 and culminate in key October payrolls data on Friday.</p>
<p>Economists tip a rise of 0.8 percent in employment costs and a fall in consumer confidence to 110.6 from September's 111.8.</p>
<p>U.S. shares were mixed in cautious London trading on Tuesday morning and dealers expected a lower start in New York, the world's dominant stock market, after Monday's weak finish.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average of top U.S. share prices was up around 26 points as London closed on Monday. But it ended 35 points lower as investors braced for a flood of statistics.</p>
<p>Just as the Dow, surrendering more than the amount it regained on Friday, ended below the key 6,000 level, London's FTSE 100 index slipped below its 4,000 landmark in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has a nervous feel...with last night's hurricane bringing back memories of 1987..today is a day to watch support levels,&quot; said Chris Chaitow at Robert Fleming Securities, referring to storms that lashed Britain overnight and the stock market crash nine years ago.</p>
<p>The London stock market, Europe's biggest, extended its losses after an extra push from stronger British consumer credit and money supply data, which suggested a strengthening domestic economy and recalled the spectre of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers were a little stronger than we had hoped,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Everyone is thinking about interest rates again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With huge economic numbers from the U.S. on Friday, a monetary meeting here and U.S. elections next week, people are not going to be buying this market,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>But economists said Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke was likely to reject any calls by Bank of England Governor Eddie George for higher rates at their monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, shares lost more than one percent due to uncertainty over interest rates, Wall Street's decline and a weaker dollar, which made less pleasant news for exporters.</p>
<p>The German institutes said current interest rates were appropriate but the Bundesbank should not shrink from tightening policy if M3 money supply growth continued to overshoot targets.</p>
<p>French shares also fell more than one percent amid worries that the German central bank might boost its key interest rates, which would have a knock-on effect in other European countries.</p>
<p>In earlier Asian trading, the dollar had hit a new 42-month high of 114.88 yen against a Japanese currency weakened by a search by Japanese investors for higher-yielding investments abroad and political uncertainty after recent elections.</p>
<p>But the U.S. currency headed lower against the mark and yen after the institutes' comments, seen as positive for the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Outside of a weak yen, you haven't got a strong dollar environment at the moment,&quot; said Chris Tinker, chief economist, treasury at Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p>After dropping as low as 1.5080 marks, the dollar steadied but was still down more than a pfennig from overnight levels.</p>
<p>Weighing in with his contribution to the debate, Bundesbank council member Olaf Sievert said current mark levels were acceptable but he would have no problem with a slightly stronger dollar as this would boost job prospects in Germany and Europe.</p>
<p>Sievert said the central bank saw no need at present to change interest rates but it remained to be seen whether the cycle of rate cuts had reached an end.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1230 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was around 1.5075 marks and 113.75 yen versus 1.5207 and 114.26 in late European business on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 1230 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was down 30.1 points at 3,995.2.</p>
<p>Germany's DAX index was 31.18 lower at 2,672.65, while in Paris the CAC-40 index lost 28.25 to 2,122.14.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $382.35 an ounce, down from Monday's London close of $383.35. Silver eased two cents to $4.91.</p>
