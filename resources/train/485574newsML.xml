<title>UK: OPTIONS - Short strangle established in BT.</title>
<headline>OPTIONS - Short strangle established in BT.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Near paralysis hit the London equity options market on Thursday, with institutional traders preferring to do very little business ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs data, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't want to do anything after the recent (share price) volatility and in case they are wrong-footed by tomorrow's figures from the States,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;It's been very quiet in both stock options and index options.&quot;</p>
<p>By early afternoon, one large trade had been struck in British Telecommunications and it involved the sale of puts and calls in a short strangle strategy.</p>
<p>The deal was to sell 1,500 May 420 puts in BT at 8p as well as 1,500 May 460 calls at 5p. The strangle has unlimited risk if the underlying shares move too far in either direction, but it will show a profit if the the shares remain in a narrow range upto expiry.</p>
<p>The recent upset in the stock market has sent short-term volatility for BT to near historic highs so that by itself, a short strangle is a bet that this volatility will reduce. If this happens it will reduce option premiums so that the seller can buy back the short options at a later stage and for a profit.</p>
<p>Ten-day historic volatility for BT shares is currently 30 percent and since May it has not gone above 33 percent although it did go as high as 48.6 percent in April.</p>
<p>If held to expiry, the short strangle will make a maximum profit of 13p if the underlying shares are anywhere between the two strike prices -- namely 420p and 460p.</p>
<p>By 1210 GMT, BT shares had shed a penny to 429-1/2p.</p>
