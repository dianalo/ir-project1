<title>SOUTH AFRICA: CALTEX TO TAKE DELIVERY OF S.AFRICAN CRUDE IN MAY.</title>
<headline>CALTEX TO TAKE DELIVERY OF S.AFRICAN CRUDE IN MAY.</headline>

<p>Caltex Oil SA said on Monday it had agreed to take the first full cargo of crude oil from South Africa's Oribi oilfield during May.  </p>
<p>The cargo is destined for the Caltex refinery in Cape Town and will be stored in the Strategic Fuel Fund tanks alongside the unit until it is processed.  </p>
<p>A Caltex spokesman said the exact delivery date would depend on oil flow from the field in the Bredasdorp Basin off South Africa's south coast.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at probably mid- to late-May,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Crude from Oribi, the country's first offshore oilfield, is low in sulphur and is comparable in quality to Brent.  </p>
<p>The first cargo for delivery to Caltex -- the nearest refinery to the field -- will be 600,000 barrels, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>The initial consignment is being purchased on a spot basis and the company said it was not possible to say how much might be taken in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a trial. It will depend on the economics and how it runs through the refinery,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The company declined to give price details but industry sources have said in the past that the limited local market and the fact that South African refineries are geared up to process heavier Middle East crudes could result in sub-optimal prices.</p>
<p>Oribi is owned by state oil concern Soekor, with Energy Africa holding a 20 percent stake.</p>
<p>With an expected production rate of 20,000 barrels of oil a day, Oribi, which is about 140 km south-west of Mossel Bay, is a minnow by world standards but should supply some five percent of South Africa's current crude oil needs.  </p>
<p>Oil will be pumped from the field into a one-million-barrel shuttle tanker for shipment to either the Caltex refinery in Cape Town or the country's two other coastal refineries in Durban.</p>
<p>With probable recoverable reserves of 20 million barrels, Oribi would have a production life of four years, although the actual outcome could be anything between two and six years.</p>
<p>The field is also expected to form the nucleus of a sequential development of several smaller fields in the Bredasdorp Basin, which should add extra recoverable reserves of 15 million to 40 million barrels.</p>
<p>Outside the Bredasdorp Basin, Soekor and Oklahoma-based Phillips Petroleum Co recently announced that they expect to finalise, within two months, a prospecting lease for blocks 17 and 18 in an area stretching from the Mozambican border to just south of Durban.</p>
