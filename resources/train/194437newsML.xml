<p>Czech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line.</p>
<p>Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns ($7 million) from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion.</p>
<p>The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though &quot;the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, Sepap year-end earnings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,&quot; a company statement said.</p>
<p>The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns.</p>
<p>Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, &quot;continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening&quot;.</p>
<p>ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Last year, Sepap was the centre of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman.</p>
<p>Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap.</p>
