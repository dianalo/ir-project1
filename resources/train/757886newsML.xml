<p>The world's major banks have jointly founded CLS Services Ltd as part of their ambitious plan to create a global foreign exchange settlement bank.</p>
<p>With the birth of CLS Services, the banks dissolved the Group of 20 (G20), the informal group that acted as a catalyst in setting up what could become a one-stop shop for settling deals in the $1.2 trillion per day foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>All the members of G20, who together account for some 40 percent of daily foreign exchange volume, have become shareholders of CLS Services, founded on Tuesday in London.</p>
<p>CLS, chaired by Stephen Thieke, managing director of J.P. Morgan, will be open to participation by other banks and instititions that provide netting services, said Rob Close, director of payments strategy at Barclays Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;CLS will provide an opportunity for others to become more directly involved,&quot; Close told Reuters.</p>
<p>Close declined to specify the size of CLS's capital, but bankers have estimated the cost of developing a CLS bank between $70 million and $80 million.</p>
<p>The hope is that CLS can integrate or closely cooperate with the Exchange Clearing House (ECHO) and Multinet International Bank (Multinet), the two institutions that currently offer multilateral netting.</p>
<p>Talks between ECHO, Multinet and G20 have been under way for some time with the aim of offering the banking industry an integrated solution to settling foreign exchange transactions.</p>
<p>Another group of commercial and investment banks, the Group of 40 (G40), also favours a single-industry solution and will meet CLS next week to discuss cooperation.</p>
<p>The founding of CLS marks a milestone in the efforts by central bankers and the banking industry to reduce the risk of a breakdown in the foreign exchange settlement system.</p>
<p>CLS Services has been set up to develop a bank that can offer real-time settlement of foreign exchange transactions, based on the principle of Continous Linked Settlements (CLS).</p>
<p>Live testing of the CLS bank's settlement system is targeted for the first quarter of 1999.</p>
<p>The system would synchronise payments in foreign exchange transactions and thus protect banks from the risk of a counterparty failing during the settlement stage.</p>
<p>CLS is a response to concern by central banks over the fragility of the foreign exchange settlement system and the systemic risk it poses to the global financial system.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange transactions account for the lion's share of domestic payment systems. Disruptions to foreign exchange settlements could quickly cause gridlock in global payment flows with serious implications for economic activity.</p>
<p>Turnover in the daily foreign exchange market doubled from 1989 to 1995 to an average $1.2 trillion. But since each trade involves at least two payments, bankers estimate that daily transactions could be around $3 trillion.</p>
<p>Worried over systemic risk, the Group of 10 (G10) central bank governors last year called on banks to quickly improve their settlement systems, both within their own back-offices, but also industry-wide.</p>
<p>So far G10 central banks have been consulted about the CLS project and view the initative as a constructive step in reducing foreing exchange settlement risks.</p>
<p>G20, founded in 1994, links the following banks:</p>
<p>ABN Amro, Bank of America, Bankers Trust, Barclays Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, Bank of Tokyo-Misubishi, Chase, CIBC, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Fuji Bank, HSBC Holdings, J.P.
