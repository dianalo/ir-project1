<p>Serbia's Orthodox Patriarch on Monday warned President Slobodan Milosevic and opposition leaders who are waging a street campaign against him that their struggle could end in armed confrontation.</p>
<p>Patriarch Pavle urged the Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition to suspend its protest on Tuesday to avoid the risk of clashes with a rival socialist show of strength in support of Milosevic.</p>
<p>Intervening in a conflict that has wracked Serbia for five weeks, Pavle expressed concern at &quot;the division in our society which could lead to armed mutual confrontation&quot;.</p>
<p>The 82-year-old patriarch praised the students for their restraint and said both sides should resist confrontation, &quot;especially members of the ruling parties behind whom stand the armed forces of the present order&quot;.</p>
<p>Zajedno, which says the socialists cheated it of victory in Belgrade and other towns in local elections on November 17, warned that police would be planted in the pro-government rally to foment trouble.</p>
<p>But it refused to halt its own demonstration despite concerns that Milosevic was looking for a pretext to declare a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Zajedno leader Vuk Draskovic told 80,000 demonstrators on Monday: &quot;Do not be afraid of them. They are all cowards and we do not want violence. But there must be five times as many of us tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The socialists were reported to be mobilising 400,000 supporters from all over Serbia for a demonstration of loyalty to Milosevic in Belgrade's central Republic Square at the same time as Zajedno's daily demonstration 100 yards away.</p>
<p>Milosevic, under threat of U.S. reprisals if he unleashes his police against the biggest challenge to his nine years in power, has been unable to find any other way of clearing the streets.</p>
<p>Hundreds of riot police are brought to Belgrade each day to be on stand-by but have been used only to bar the path of students marching towards Milosevic's home.</p>
<p>The socialists' plan to bring thousands of supporters from the provinces by bus was jeopardised by the Independent Farmers' Union which said it would paralyse transport by blocking roads on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Leaders of the union staged a symbolic blockade of the road between the northern towns of Novi Sad and Zrenjanin on Monday. They said the action was non-political and in demand for money the government owes farmers.</p>
<p>Workers have mostly ignored the intelligentsia-based marches in Belgrade but the farmers' threat to intensify the confrontation boded ill for Milosevic's efforts to regain the political initiative.</p>
<p>Diplomats believe the socialists hoped to mobilise a show of strength of the kind seen in France in 1968 when several hundred thousand supporters marched in a show of loyalty to President Charles de Gaulle.</p>
<p>The middle class march in central Paris was among the factors that helped end violent student demonstrations and strikes that crippled the country for six weeks.</p>
<p>There was no official comment on reports that Milosevic, who rarely appears in public but always speaks decisively when he does, would address the rally.</p>
<p>A mission from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) spent the weekend in Belgrade investigating what member called &quot;pretty impressive evidence&quot; of socialist election rigging.</p>
<p>It is expected to issue a verdict within a week on Zajedno's demand, supported by the United States and other Western governmments, for the election results to be honoured.</p>
