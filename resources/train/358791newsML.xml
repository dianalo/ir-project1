<p>The arrest of two South Korean bankers on Wednesday marks the latest in a string of loan scandals plaguing the banking industry and underscores the need for financial restructuring, analysts said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors arrested the heads of two leading banks -- Sheen Kwang-shik of Korea First Bank and Woo Chan-mok of Cho Hung Bank -- on charges of bribery in connection with huge loans to Hanbo Steel Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The scandal illustrates the need for financial reform,&quot; said Kim Byong-sok, a banking analyst at Hannuri-Salomon Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts said the banking industry had been haunted by corruption, risky loans and lack of proper credit analysis.</p>
<p>As many as 16 heads of local banks have been jailed or forced to resign since President Kim Young-sam took office in 1993 on an anti-corruption platform, they said. Most were found to have received bribes from borrowers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a structural problem,&quot; said Rhee Namuh, research head at Dongbang Peregrine Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks have acted as tools of government industrial policy. Their credit decisions and management are heavily influenced by the government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Korea First Bank is the biggest creditor to Hanbo Steel, the country's second largest steelmaker and flagship of the Hanbo Group, with outstanding loans of 1.08 trillion won ($1.24 billion). Cho Hung Bank has loaned 494 billion won.</p>
<p>Hanbo Steel racked up about five trillion won in loans from 61 banks and financial institutions before it was declared insolvent on January 23.</p>
<p>Analysts said political corruption was so endemic in the banking sector that the scandal would be repeated unless legal measures were taken against all political players involved.</p>
<p>&quot;Bank heads would again be the only ones arrested, leaving politicians untouched,&quot; said Kim of Hannuri-Salomon.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank heads are the scapegoats,&quot; said Rhee of Dongbang Peregrine.</p>
<p>Banks have often been unwilling backers of reckless business expansion, forced to extend loans by a government that has treated them as state cashiers.</p>
<p>&quot;Inefficient allocation of capital led to extremely low return on corporate investment,&quot; said Rhee.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Hanbo crisis would mean another bad year for banks, hammered by falling stock investments. Bank profits slumped by an average of 2.4 percent to a combined 846.8 billion won last year.</p>
<p>The Hanbo crisis has also increased the cost of raising funds abroad due to fears of credit risk.</p>
<p>Analysts said in the absence of any stern action against political meddling, financial reform was the only way to save the industry from further corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;Introduction of private bank ownership would force banks to be more responsible in handling loans and raising profits,&quot; said Kim of Hannuri-Salomon.</p>
<p>Currently, bank ownership is diluted as shareholders excluding the government are limited to no more than four percent of outstanding shares. Bank heads are selected by senior officials and approved by the Office of Bank Supervision.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank owners will concentrate on making profits by investing in sound investments under careful credit analysis,&quot; Kim said.</p>
