<p>Three-quarters of German voters think Europe's planned single currency should be delayed if member countries do not meet the tough Maastricht criteria for it, a new survey said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A mere 14 percent argued for softening the tough line backed by the Bundesbank central bank and Finance Minister Theo Waigel in order to allow the launch to take place on schedule in 1999, the Forsa survey in the weekly Die Woche said.</p>
<p>Die Woche also published two bank surveys showing widespread scepticism among business executives about the monetary union. Only 22 percent were positive about it and only 14 percent expected it to start on time.</p>
<p>The Forsa survey, the latest showing German voters were far more sceptical than their government about the planned economic and monetary union (EMU), said 53 percent of the 1,007 people surveyed fully backed Bonn's tough line on the criteria.</p>
<p>Another 33 percent, mostly supporters of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), said the conditions could be softened.</p>
<p>Die Woche did not explain the apparent contradiction between the 75 percent ready to delay the euro if members did not meet the criteria and the lower level of actual support for the tough conditions themselves.</p>
<p>But it also registered a high level of concern about the euro -- 47 percent expect it to have a negative impact and only 22 percent foresaw a positive effect -- that could back up the demand to follow the rules now that they have been laid down.</p>
<p>Norbert Walter, the pro-EMU chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said Bonn's insistence on a strict application of the Maastricht criteria had made unacceptable any leeway that could have been economically justified.</p>
<p>Asked by ProSieben television if the deficit must be exactly three percent or less, he said an economist might not be worried about the exact figures.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the end, it's the voter and the politicians who decide,&quot; he said. &quot;(The politicians) have promised 3.0 percent in Germany and we have to stick to that figure, otherwise the already shaky confidence in the euro will be even further endangered. That cannot and will not happen.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1991 Maastricht treaty says EMU members should have new borrowing levels no more than three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and overall debt no higher than 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The Forsa survey, carried out on March 6-7, showed 76 percent did not believe Chancellor Helmut Kohl's warnings that a failure to introduce the euro would throw back Europe's integration drive dramatically.</p>
<p>Forty-seven percent of those queried thought the single currency would be introduced a few years late if it did not start in 1999 while 38 percent thought a delay would kill it.</p>
<p>In a survey carried out by WGZ-Bank in Duesseldorf, 14 percent of executives in Germany's important medium-sized firms saw good chances of the euro being launched on time, 38 percent doubted it would start in 1999 and 48 percent thought the new currency had only a medium chance of taking off on schedule.</p>
<p>Asked how they assessed the euro, 22 percent said positively, 27 percent negatively and 51 percent proclaimed themselves neutral, Die Woche said.</p>
<p>Seventy-five percent of medium-sized firms responding to a poll by Deutsche Bank said they had not yet begun assessing the consequences of the single currency.</p>
<p>The same percentage said they had not yet begun preparing their computer systems for the new money, Die Woche said.</p>
<p>However, a large majority of the executives -- 86 percent -- said they were either well or very well informed about the planned currency. REUTER TH</p>
