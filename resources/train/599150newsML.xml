<p>Bestselling ex-FBI agent Gary Aldrich angrily denied Monday telling a New Yorker magazine reporter that an embarrassing allegation he made about President Clinton's private life was &quot;hypothetical&quot; and &quot;not quite solid.&quot;</p>
<p>And the publishers of his best-selling book &quot;Unlimited Access&quot; accused the magazine and its reporter Jane Mayer of indulging in a &quot;leftwing hachet job.&quot;</p>
<p>But both Mayer and the New Yorker stood by the story, saying that it had been confirmed by both Aldrich's agent and the man who edited his book -- a no-holds-barred assault on the morality of the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>In the book published last year by Regnery Publishing, Inc., a conservative press, Aldrich claimed that the president secretly slipped out of the White House for assignations with a &quot;female who may be a celebrity&quot; at a Washington hotel and did so by hiding under a blanket in the back seat of a car.</p>
<p>The allegation was attacked at the time as sheer rumour and one anti-Clinton Washington reporter said he had passed the information on to Aldrich as such and was shocked to see that he had included it in his book as fact.</p>
<p>In the New Yorker, Aldrich was quoted as saying that the allegation -- which he had stood by despite the criticism -- was actually &quot;not quite solid&quot; and had been originally included in a &quot;hypothetical&quot; epilogueue to the book that was written to look like an FBI file containing raw, unsubstantiated material.</p>
<p>According to the New Yorker, the book's editor demanded that Aldrich include the allegation in the main body of the book and threatened not to publish the book if he refused.</p>
<p>But Aldrich said in a statement that that he stood behind &quot;every word of my book&quot; and called on the New Yorker to &quot;publicly release any tapes of interviews I did with the reporter.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said he wanted to debate Mayer. &quot;To lie, to make quotes goes beyond the pale, even for the liberal media,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mayer told Reuters that while she did not tape record her telephone interview with Aldrich, her notes on her interview &quot;are as clear as day.&quot; She said her account was later backed up by the book's editor and by Aldrich's agent.</p>
