<title>USA: Freeport-McMoRan stock up despite Busang.</title>
<headline>Freeport-McMoRan stock up despite Busang.</headline>
<dateline>NEW ORLEANS, La. 1997-03-27</dateline>

<p>Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc eked out a gain for the day despite discouraging news about the much ballyhooed Busang project that Freeport-McMoRan and Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd were to jointly develop.</p>
<p>The Louisiana-based mining giant's stock rose $0.50 to 30-1/8. Bre-X stock, however sank C$13 to C$2.50 a share on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Busang was supposed to be one of largest gold finds of the century, but instead Freeport-McMoRan said this week that the location in East Kalimantan, Indonesia may have &quot;insignificant&quot; amounts of the valuable ore.</p>
<p>The jury was still out on the project, analysts and Bre-X officials said.</p>
<p>Freeport-McMoRan emerged relatively unscathed from the debacle because the firm had only recently gotten into the venture with Bre-X and never actually owned anything.  </p>
<p>&quot;They had an option to acquire 15 percent of it and they still have that option, but they did not have it yet,&quot; said Victor Lazarovici of Smith Barney.</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Freeport-McMoRan said it &quot;will elect to participate in the development of the Busang project only if development is...economically feasible.&quot;  </p>
<p>Analysts said the disappointing news would not affect earnings estimates because they had not yet factored Busang into Freeport-McMoRan's numbers. According to First Call financial service, analysts are predicting earnings of around $1.11 per share this year, up from $0.89, on revenues of $1.97 billion, in 1996.</p>
<p>Lazarovici said he had raised the company's stock target price to $38, but on Wednesday trimmed it to a pre-Busang $34.50.  </p>
<p>&quot;We remain and have every confidence that there is the reserve potential in the Busang property that we have stated,&quot; Bre-X chief executive David Walsh told reporters in Calgary on Thursday.</p>
<p>The company has hired Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd, a mining consultant, to conduct an audit of the drilling and sampling programs done by both Bre-X and Freeport-McMoRan.</p>
