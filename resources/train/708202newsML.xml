<p>Belgian steel group Usines Gustave Boel (UGB) said on Friday that stainless steel firm Fabrique de Fer (Fafer), which its shareholder Boel controls, was not for sale.</p>
<p>(Corrects to make clear the Boel Group controls both Fafer and UGB and only Boel Group can act as the seller of Fafer.)</p>
<p>A UGB spokesman said, &quot;the main shareholders of Boel do not want to sell Fafer...they are thinking about the future of the company in an international context...they do not exclude the possibility of cooperation with an international partner with a European view.&quot;  </p>
<p>Pierre Stievenart, spokesman for both UGB and Fafer, told Reuters that Fafer itself would issue a press release at about 1400 hours (1200 GMT).</p>
<p>He was commenting on a report in Belgian daily Le Soir which said UGB, which recently signed a 50/50 cooperation deal with Dutch Hoogovens, was considering selling Fafer.</p>
<p>Bourse-listed Fafer was being sold because its current size meant its long-term future could not be guaranteed and because of a lack of interest in Fafer from the younger generation of the Boel family which holds 50.5 percent of Fafer.  </p>
<p>Le Soir said possible buyers included British Steel, Belgian-Luxembourg group Arbed/Sidmar and France's Usinor-Sacilor.</p>
<p>Usinor declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>In April Fafer, with annual output of some 200,000 tonnes and sales of about 15 billion francs, said net profit in the six months to December 21, 1996 fell to 111 million francs from 250 million as a result of disappointing macro-economic growth.</p>
<p>It said at the time it expected little improvement in the second half.</p>
<p>In the wake of the collapse of Belgian steel maker Forges de Clabecq  CLAB.BR early this year there were efforts on the part of the Walloon regional government to form a single Walloon steel group between Fafer, Clabecq and Cockerill Sambre .</p>
<p>The various parties failed to agree, however.</p>
<p>Clabecq is now in the process of being part-sold to Italian-Swiss group Duferco.</p>
