<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine oil firms blame river leaks on weather.</title>
<headline>Argentine oil firms blame river leaks on weather.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-03-13</dateline>

<p>Argentine oil companies said Thursday recent damage to pipelines which caused leaks of crude oil into the Colorado river were caused by bad weather.</p>
<p>&quot;The leaks were caused by torrential rain and slides of water and rocks which are completely abnormal in the area,&quot; the companies YPF, Perez Companc, Petrolera San Jorge,  Mexpetrol and  Oldeval said in a paid advertisement published in local newspapers.</p>
<p>The Rio Colorado crosses some 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) through central Argentina from the Andes to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As many as 300,000 liters of crude oil may have seeped into the river upstream, where the oil wells are located, after recent storms, according to media reports.</p>
<p>The companies claimed that before the latest leakages February 16 and March 6 they had hired international consultants to carry out an impact study but nobody had warned of the risk of the present damage.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no possible precautions you can take when 100 milimeters of rain fall in 20 minutes and a torrent of water digs up earth 3.5 meters (11.6 feet) deep, exposing pipes which are hit by rocks weighing up to two tonnes,&quot; the companies said.</p>
<p>They said they were currently cleaning up affected areas.</p>
<p>Local authorities in western Neuquen province told Reuters this week the river had already cleansed itself to a large extent thanks to its strong current.</p>
<p>But at least one province, Rio Negro, was considering suing the oil companies for damage to riverside crops through lack of clean water.</p>
<p>The governors of the five provinces the river runs through are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the oil spills which they say have become a chronic problem in recent years.</p>
