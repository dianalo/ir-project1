<p>DB Group Ltd Managing Director Erik Korthals Altes said the answer to New Zealand's declining beer and wine consumption was in positioning the company to take advantage of a clearly defined trend toward quality.</p>
<p>Korthals Altes said in an interview the net decline was created by a &quot;massive&quot; change in consumption patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Beer, instead of being something as a means to get drunk and to show your machismo among your friends, is becoming more a part of social interaction and enjoying yourself, a social lubricant,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have seen a massive shift to glass, we see a shift away from tap beer. The net effect is less consumption,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>DB had seen the same thing happen with its Corbans wine business, where people were increasingly trading up from casks to bottles.</p>
<p>Korthals Altes said DB, after suffering a decline in its share of the domestic beer market since 1990, had finally turned the corner.  </p>
<p>&quot;The interesting thing is that part of the recovery of our market share came from the higher end of the market, where discounting is not playing a role, whereas some of our competitors are trying to reverse the market trend by lowering prices. That's not working.&quot;</p>
<p>DB Group is 59.8 percent owned by Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd, a venture between Heineken NV and Fraser and Neave Ltd.</p>
<p>Korthals Altes said locally-brewed Heineken, while not a big brand in New Zealand, had opened doors for the DB stable. Like Heineken, DB Export was now seen as a &quot;must-stock&quot; brand.  </p>
<p>&quot;Heineken is at the top of the pyramid. Okay, the volume is not fantastic, but anybody who wants to trade up will be caught by Heineken and that is working.&quot;</p>
<p>To Korthals Altes, whose backround is in marketing with the Dutch brewer, discounting is a dirty word. Heineken, which sells locally at NZ$19.95 a dozen, would never be discounted, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that there is only one solution in New Zealand minds to compensate for volume loss and that is lower prices.</p>
<p>&quot;We are no longer short-term reactive. We are proactive.</p>
<p>&quot;We set our own course. We take in signals from the market, review them and decide whether we will react at all.&quot;</p>
