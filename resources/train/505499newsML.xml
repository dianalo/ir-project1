<headline>German war crimes exhibition prompts new protests.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-13</dateline>

<p>Police scuffled with demonstrators in Germany on Sunday as an exhibition on war crimes committed by Hitler's army, which whipped up furious controversy when it showed in Munich earlier this year, moved to Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, said the exhibition displayed the true bestiality of the Nazi era and urged more Germans to see it.</p>
<p>The exhibition uses photographs and letters from soldiers to back up its premise that the regular army, the Wehrmacht, as well as the SS units usually blamed for war crimes, participated in mass killings of Jews and other atrocities.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Wehrmacht had really been as innocent as the myth would have it, the murder of European Jews would have been much less efficient and more would have survived,&quot; Bubis said.</p>
<p>&quot;It made no difference to the Jewish victims of the Nazi terror whether it was the SS, the Waffen-SS, a soldier or a policeman who drove them out of their homes and murdered ther relatives and friends, the young and the old.&quot;</p>
<p>Over 220,000 people in 17 German and Austrian cities have seen the exhibition. But it only really came to public notice three months ago after outraged right-wing politicians and neo-Nazis in conservative Bavaria protested and demonstrated against it, calling it biased and badly researched.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's city council banned a demonstration on Sunday against the exhibition by the far-right Republicans party.</p>
<p>But police still briefly detained six people and ordered 26 others to leave the area after scuffles involving right-wing protesters against the exhibition and left-wing counter-demonstrators.</p>
