<p>Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said on Tuesday Baghdad had extended Kurdish faction leader Massoud Barzani an open invitation for talks on Kurdish self-rule in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Aziz said Baghdad, which helped Barzani take control of Iraq's three northern provinces last month and oust rival Jalal Talabani, was seeking a political solution after five years of virtual Kurdish autonomy under a Western-policed no- fly-zone.</p>
<p>&quot;The call for dialogue exists,&quot; Aziz told a meeting of Iraqi expatriates in Baghdad. &quot;It does not need to be announced. It is known.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said it was up to Barzani to take the initiative and suggested Baghdad was in no hurry.</p>
<p>&quot;The matter is up to the brothers there and the political leadership in the north,&quot; Aziz said.</p>
<p>&quot;When it finds itself ready to enter talks with the leadership in Baghdad -- and Baghdad is their city, their capital -- they are welcome,&quot; he added. &quot;The Iraqi leadership's programme for a peaceful political solution...hasn't changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Iraqi troops helped Barzani's Kurdish Democratic Party capture the northern city of Arbil from Talabani in August.</p>
<p>The United States, saying Baghdad was intervening against one of its minorities, launched punitive missile strikes and United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali put a long-awaited oil-for-food deal on hold.</p>
<p>The accord, agreed in May, would allow Baghdad to export $2 billion of oil over a six month period in order to buy urgently needed food and medicine.</p>
<p>Aziz said the United Nations was delaying the agreement to appease Washington, which has already announced it will oppose Boutros-Ghali's reappointment at the end of his five-year term.</p>
<p>Aziz said Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, lobbying at the UN headquarters in New York for the deal to be carried out, could not get an appointment with any of Boutros- Ghali's assistants.</p>
<p>&quot;This delay is tactical, to be continued perhaps until after the American elections,&quot; Aziz said. &quot;It means the people in the UN Secretariat General do not want to anger (U.S. President Bill) Clinton or embarrass him in the American elections.&quot;</p>
<p>When an Iraqi expatriate from the United States told him Clinton had said he was ready for dialogue with Aziz or Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Aziz replied:</p>
<p>&quot;Tell him Iraq is willing for dialogue. It is them who are objecting to the idea.&quot;</p>
