<p>Zaire's army will fight to the end to defend the capital Kinshasa which is threatened by rebels advancing from the east, emergency rule Prime Minister General Likulia Bolongo said on Monday.</p>
<p>Interviewed on state television, Likulia called on foreigners and Zaireans in the city of over five million people to remain calm in the face of rebel threats of imminent attack.  </p>
<p>&quot;The army is prepared to defend Kinshasa,&quot; Likulia said, speaking in Zaire's Lingala lingua franca. &quot;All dispositions have been taken to defend Kinshasa. I can assure you that we have sufficient arms to assure the security of the capital.&quot;</p>
<p>He said threats by rebel leader Laurent Kabila that his forces were ready to march on Kinshasa in three weeks were part of psychological warfare the rebels had used successfully in the six-month-old civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;There have to be negotiations. But if Kabila does not want to negotiate we're ready to fight to the end,&quot; Likulia said.</p>
<p>Rebels have seized half of Zaire's vast territory since taking up arms in October to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko. Kinshasa is the most important city still in government hands.</p>
