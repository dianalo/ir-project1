<title>USA: ValuJet crash site to remain closed.</title>

<p>The watery site of the ValuJet Flight 592 crash in Florida's Everglades will remain closed as personal effects of victims float to the surface, state officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The remote location where the DC-9 crashed on May 11, killing all 110 people on board, will likely be closed permanently by order of Florida's governor as a memorial to the victims.</p>
<p>Homicide detectives and state wildlife officers were at the crash site Thursday picking up shirts, shoes, purses and other debris from the doomed jetliner, which nosedived into water-covered muck about 30 miles (48 km) west of Miami.</p>
<p>The Metro-Dade County Police Department has an open criminal investigation into the crash and two federal agencies also were conducting criminal probes, according to published reports.</p>
<p>A period of dry summer weather lowered the level of water in the Everglades, bringing more crash debris to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still finding personal items,&quot; said Lt. Col. Woody Darden, regional director of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. &quot;We expect that to continue for some time as weather conditions change.&quot;</p>
<p>Darden said the closure was designed to protect the integrity of the site and also because it still represented a human health hazard. In the days after the crash, the site was a mire of toxic chemicals and decaying human remains. Officers picking up crash debris wear protective clothing.</p>
<p>In June, officials closed a 97,000-acre wildlife refuge surrounding the crash location for 90 days, an order due to expire in early September.</p>
<p>At a meeting on Sept. 12, Florida's governor and cabinet were expected to declare the immediate crash site a permanent burial ground for the victims, some of whose remains were never found.</p>
<p>Darden said a 5-10 acre site would be fenced and a memorial to victims erected there.</p>
