<headline>Brazil's Mesbla debt deal seen in June.</headline>

<p>The first stage of a plan to restructure debts and bail out Brazilian troubled retail chain Mesbla is expected to be concluded in June, said an official at a bank representing a group of the firm's creditors.</p>
<p>Ney Alves, vice-president at Banco Pontual, said the group, which holds Mesbla's debentures, hopes to be called for a meeting to approve a debt conversion plan by June 20, with the debt converted into shares about 30 days later.</p>
<p>&quot;With most of the debt converted into capital, we will have a retail chain without short-term debt and capitalized. This is our clients' goal,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Press reports have said that 95 percent of Mesbla's creditors have already agreed to convert their debt into shares.</p>
<p>Once a leading local retailer, Mesbla filed for debt relief under a section of the bankruptcy law equivalent to Chapter 11 in the U.S. in 1995.  Since October last year Mesbla has been managed by Banco Pactual, which was hired by the firm's main creditors to restructure the company.</p>
<p>The company's debts to be converted into shares, which reportedly amount to about 500 million reais, are owed to debenture holders, banks and suppliers.  </p>
<p>Local banks Unibanco and BCN are the largest creditors.</p>
<p>While Pactual works on the debt restructuring, local and foreign investors have shown interest in acquiring the company -- including local department store chain Mappin, owned by businessman Ricardo Mansur.</p>
<p>Mansur has already proposed buying a controlling stake in Mesbla, according to sources at Banco Pactual.</p>
<p>Pontual's Alves said that only after the debt conversion program Mesbla will be able to be put for sale.</p>
<p>&quot;The first step is to reorganize the company. In a second stage, we will think about the sale,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Alves noted, however, the debenture holders think that &quot;the sale to a group in the (retail) business would be desirable.&quot;</p>
