<p>Australia's priority after being trounced by England in the first Ashes test is to get Shane Warne into match-winning shape for the season's showpiece at Lord's.</p>
<p>Warne's wrist spin is such a crucial element in Australia's attack that, after a low-key start to the tour, it is imperative he is bowling more incisively in the second test starting at cricket's traditional headquarters in 10 days time.</p>
<p>Much of the touring team's work in the two three-day matches between now and the Lord's test -- against Nottinghamshire and county champions Leicestershire -- will almost certainly be devoted to improving the performance of the attack as a whole.</p>
<p>Australia's bowlers suffered heavy punishment as England shrugged off an uncertain start with positive batting on their way to a nine-wicket victory on the fourth day here at Edgbaston on Sunday.</p>
<p>Warne took one for 110 in 35 overs in the first innings while the pace bowling burden fell on Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz after Jason Gillespie broke down with a hamstring problem after he bowled only 10 overs.</p>
<p>Injuries to Gillespie and Andy Bichel prompted the tour management to seek a pace bowling reinforcement, and the selectors chose Paul Reiffel, who is due to join the party on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Reiffel is a proven performer in English conditions, having finished top of Australia's test averages in the last Ashes series here in 1993 when he took 19 wickets at 20.84 in three tests.</p>
<p>Australian captain Mark Taylor, having ended his form crisis with a courageous 129 in the second innings, believes his side can now focus on producing improved form all round.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the time for panic,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got to work out ways to do the job better.&quot;</p>
<p>England's buoyant team, having won the opening test of an Ashes series for the first time since 1986-87, are nonetheless adopting a level-headed attitude with five more tests to come.</p>
<p>Nasser Hussain, vice-captain and man-of-the match for his test-best 207, said: &quot;We are not getting carried away, but this was a brilliant feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many people in that dressing room who have been beaten by Australia in the past. We will enjoy the moment and drink some champagne, but there is a long way to go.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a convincing win, but the importance of this series is to judge ourselves on how far we have come along as a team.&quot;</p>
