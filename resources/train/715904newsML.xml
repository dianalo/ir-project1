<p>Turkmenistan has harvested a paltry 600,000 tonnes of grain in 1997, or half the official target, and President Saparmurat Niyazov has sacked officials he said were responsible.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan gathered just 50.6 percent of the initially targeted 1.2 million tonnes, the State Statistics Committee said in its preliminary report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But output was still up on last year's paltry 480,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The committee said the figures could be slightly corrected later, but that would not change the overall picture.</p>
<p>The meagre harvest gathered this year is the second failed attempt in a row by the resource-rich but impoverished country with a population of around four million to achieve self-sufficiency in grain.</p>
<p>Like last year, Niyazov, who enjoys sweeping executive powers, has sacked what he calls the culprits.</p>
<p>Among those sacked this year are Pirkuli Odeyev, Agriculture Minister and acting Deputy Prime Minister, Nurmukhammed Ashirov, governor of the country's main grain-growing Alkal region, and numerous district heads of the same region.</p>
<p>&quot;Good undertakings of peasants have been blocked by the bureaucracy of the authorities,&quot; Niyazov thundered on national television on Tuesday. &quot;It is abnormal to gather such poor harvests in the region with fertile lands and irrigation.&quot;</p>
<p>In April he presented his own ambitious economic programme, setting the production of 2.0 million tonnes of grain by 2000 as one of Turkmenistan's main economic tasks.</p>
<p>But so far the secretive, impoverished nation, where serious economic reforms have been delayed, has been heavily relying on grain imports.</p>
<p>Last year Turkmenistan imported $800 million of grain, according to the official Turkmen Press news agency.</p>
