<p>Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo fired his attorney general on Monday after a series of failures in high-profile assassination cases.</p>
<p>Antonio Lozano Gracia, 43, the only opposition member of the Cabinet, will be replaced by Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, a political independent who currently heads the government's Human Rights Commission, Zedillo's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement did not say why Lozano was fired, but a senior government official, speaking off the record, told Reuters &quot;sheer incompetence&quot; was the reason.</p>
<p>&quot;There have been many instances in which Lozano did not provide the results he was asked to,&quot; the official said. &quot;He created enormous expectations but did not live up to them.&quot;</p>
<p>Interior Minister Emilio Chuayfett said Madrazo, a respected lawyer who has spoken out against irregularities by ruling party officials, will be given the same freedom as Lozano to pursue investigations.</p>
<p>Madrazo pledged to clean up the attorney general's office and said he would not allow politics to interfere with the law. He also promised to step up the fight against drug trafficking, most of which is funneled to the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;My actions will always be guided by two principles in which I believe wholeheartedly: truth and the law,&quot; Madrazo told a news conference.</p>
<p>Zedillo has repeatedly vowed to impose the rule of law on Mexico, where the rich and powerful have long been seen as immune from prosecution for anything from tax fraud to murder.</p>
<p>After taking office in December 1994, Zedillo appointed Lozano, a federal deputy and parliamentary leader for the conservative National Action Party's (PAN), as the first-ever opposition politician to serve at Cabinet level.</p>
<p>As attorney general, Lozano was charged with investigating two highly sensitive 1994 murder cases, both involving the killing of top ruling party politicians. He failed to solve either case.</p>
<p>His prosecutors said presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was murdered in a conspiracy but saw their cases against several suspects collapse in court. That investigation is now on its fourth special prosecutor with no visible results except the imprisonment of one confessed gunman.</p>
<p>In the other big murder case, that of ruling party secretary-general Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Lozano's office blundered again and again, government officials said.</p>
<p>Zedillo allowed the arrest in March 1995 of former president Carlos Salinas's brother Raul on charges of conspiracy to murder Ruiz Massieu -- but Lozano's office has failed to provide hard evidence to secure a conviction.</p>
<p>In October, Lozano's team leaked tips to reporters of a major find in the case, then presented them with a skeleton dug up in the garden of a ranch used by Raul Salinas.</p>
<p>Lozano told reporters the body was probably that of Manuel Munoz Rocha, a congressman and friend of Raul's who allegedly helped him organize Ruiz Massieu's murder and was himself then killed to cover up the crime.</p>
<p>Reporters asked why the fingers and most of the teeth were missing from the body dug up on Raul Salinas' ranch, and questioned a circular cut around the skull that was similar to one practiced in autopsies. Lozano promised forensic tests to prove his theory within a month.</p>
<p>Nearly two months went by before the pro-government daily Excelsior on Monday quoted a top forensic official as saying the body was not that of Munoz Rocha.</p>
<p>Zedillo's officials said they had made no effort to seek a replacement for Lozano from the PAN, preferring an independent without party connections. The PAN had no immediate comment.</p>
