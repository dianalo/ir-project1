<p>LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton may raise its stake in Grand Metropolitan if chairman Bernard Arnault does not rally enough investor support during a roadshow in London this week to block the planned Guinness -GrandMet merger, analysts say.</p>
<p>LVMH revealed on Wednesday that it had raised its stake to 11.05 percent from 6.4 percent and paid in part by reducing its stake in Guinness to 12.46 percent from 14.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The message to the British is clear. LVMH will not give in. Its determination to block their merger is even stronger,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Another analyst said that if Arnault draws enough support in London, he may not have to spend any more money on GrandMet stock.</p>
<p>Otherwise he may go as high as 15 percent, analysts estimate, in a bid to force the British groups to accept his alternative proposal to spin off their beer and food businesses and agree to a three-way drinks merger.</p>
<p>Some analysts say Arnault may finance further GrandMet share purchases by selling Guinness stock. One analyst said Guinness holds little potential for Arnault, who is barred under a prior 1994 accord with Guinness from buying more than 15 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts say some pension funds are likely to back Arnault, particularly if he is flexible on the valuation of LVMH's stake in the new drinks group. It would bring its 66 percent Moet Hennessy stake and its holdings in Guinness and Grand Met to the new entity and had envisaged a holding of 35 percent. But he has signalled flexibility and analysts see a compromise around 30 percent.</p>
<p>LVMH needs to line up shares representing 25 percent of GrandMet's stock to block the merger at an extraordinary general meeting, which it has the right to call after acquiring more than 10 percent.</p>
<p>Guinness's shareholders can approve the merger with a bare majority, so analysts say LVMH has more interest in focusing on GrandMet investors.</p>
<p>LVMH's stock finished up 4.3 percent at 1,626 francs.</p>
