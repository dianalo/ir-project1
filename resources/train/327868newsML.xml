<text>
<p>Chechnya, which holds elections for a president and regional assembly on Monday, has been a Russian region for nearly 140 years, but after a two-year war with Moscow, its leaders are set on independence.</p>
<p>Here are some key facts and figures about Chechnya.</p>
<p>TERRITORY: Some 15,000 sq km (5,800 sq miles) -- about half the size of Belgium or a shade bigger than Connecticut. Sitting on Russia's southern flank, it has an 80 km (50 mile) frontier with Georgia along the 5,000-metre (16,000-foot) Caucasus ridge.</p>
<p>POPULATION: Before the 1994-1996 war, some 1.1 million people -- two-thirds of them ethnic Chechens and a quarter Russians. Ethnic Russians were concentrated in the capital, Grozny, where nearly 400,000 people lived in 1994 and some northern areas of Chechnya. There are no reliable data on casualties, but tens of thousands of civilians died in the fighting and hundreds of thousands fled their homes. Many refugees are in the neighbouring regions of Dagestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia but many, especially ethnic Russians, fled further afield.</p>
<p>ELECTORATE: Put at 662,895 by Russia's Central Electoral Commission on the eve of voting in a December 1995 presidential election. The poll was won by Moscow's candidate, local Soviet-era leader Doku Zavgayev, but marked by widespread irregularities.</p>
<p>ECONOMY: Oil output flourished from the late 19th century but reserves are now scarce. Hopes of economic revival centre on reconstruction of war-damaged refineries and income from a pipeline carrying new Caspian reserves to the Black Sea. Official unemployment is estimated at up to 90 percent. But many Chechens work the land in extended families and receive cash from relatives working in Russia and elsewhere. Moscow has promised massive aid after the elections but reconstruction of buildings wrecked in the war has barely begun.</p>
<p>HISTORY: The mountain people of Chechnya converted to Islam from the late 16th century. Two hundred years of sporadic war with Russia began when Christian Georgia agreed a union with Moscow in 1783, leaving the North Caucasus encircled.</p>
<p>The Chechen Sheikh Mansour led a jihad or holy war in the 1780s but the fiercest fighting was in the 1817-64 Caucasus War. Russians coined the name &quot;Chechen&quot;. Chechens call their nation Ichkeria. It was incorporated into the Russian empire in 1859. Grozny -- it means &quot;Terrible&quot; in Russian -- was founded in 1870.</p>
<p>In 1944, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, accusing them of aiding the German invaders, deported the entire Chechen people to the steppes of Central Asia. Many thousands died. In 1957 Nikita Khrushchev allowed the Chechens and their Ingush kin to return and reestablished the Checheno-Ingush ethnic republic.</p>
<p>In October 1991, Soviet Air Force general Dzhokhar Dudayev stirred up protests against Grozny rulers and won 80 percent support in an election. He declared independence and then faced down a brief and bloodless military expedition from Moscow. Chechnya split from Ingushetia in June 1992 and began to earn a reputation in Russia as a haven for armed bandits and smugglers.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin ordered troops into Chechnya on December 11, 1994. Badly-led troops met fierce resistance from determined guerrillas. Russia troops took Grozny and much of the Chechen plain by spring 1995 but never won full control. In April 1996 Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev replaced Dudayev, who had been reported killed in a Russian rocket attack. Rebel forces infiltrated Grozny on August 6, 1996 and seized the city. Russia made peace on August 31, withdrawing its troops and leaving the Chechen sovereignty issue open for five years but refusing to countenance secession.</p>
<p>ELECTIONS: Sixteen candidates are vying for a five-year presidential term. The leading contenders are chief military commander Aslan Maskhadov, prominent field commander Shamil Basayev, propaganda chief Movladi Udugov, and Yandarbiyev.</p>
<p>To win in the first round, a candidate must win more than half the votes cast (50 percent plus one vote). If no candidate achieves this, a runoff vote is held two weeks later. If less than 50 percent of voters turn up at either round it is declared invalid and repeated within one month.</p>
<p>About 850 candidates are seeking election to the 63-member parliament, which will serve for five years. All seats are allocated on the basis of single-mandate constituencies, although candidates may list party affiliation.</p>
<p>ARMED FORCES: There is no reliable information about the size of the rebel forces. About 5,000 guerrillas are believed to be under Maskhadov's command. But almost every grown-up man and many teenagers in the region are armed and traditionally seen as potential warriors.</p>
