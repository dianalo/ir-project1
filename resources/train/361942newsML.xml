<p>Several Thais were missing after a commuter boat collided with a cargo barge on Thursday, dumping dozens of passengers into Bangkok's Chao Phraya river, police said.</p>
<p>Rescue teams were searching the capital's main river after the express boat packed with an unknown number of passengers, sank after crashing into a barge loaded with sand on the northern outskirts of Bangkok at around 6.30 a.m. (2330 GMT).</p>
<p>The boat's skipper told police he believed about five people were still missing but police said they suspected the number was higher as the boats, which officially hold 93 passengers, are usually packed with more than 120 during the rush hour.</p>
<p>Four passengers were injured, and rescue teams from the navy, harbour department and marine police pulled out another 17 people while about 30 more swam to shore, police said.</p>
<p>Bangkok's notorious traffic snarls have forced thousands of people to use boats to commute.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine people died in June 1995 after a floating pier packed with commuters collasped and sank on the same river.</p>
