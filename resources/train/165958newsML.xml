<p>South African shares ended down on Tuesday as they failed to convincingly recover from an early wave of futures-selling that followed through from late trade on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Futures traders dumped stock in a quietish market whose nerves are still frayed by last week's mauling at the hands of the ailing rand. Industrial stocks bore the brunt of the losses.</p>
<p>Positive data from South Africa's producer price index (PPI) provided some support to haul shares off their day lows, but the index never fully regained its early losses. The PPI data came in slightly better than expected.</p>
<p>The all-share index lost 28.9 points to end at 6,924.0 and the industrials index shed 26.9 points to close at 8,148.4.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market would look to Wall Street's performance for overnight guidance, but that signals may not be clear as New York markets hang nervously on the results of Tuesday's national elections.</p>
<p>&quot;For industrials it all depends on what happens on Wall Street,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The golds index fared better and rose 7.6 points to 1,740.1 as the bullion price steadied, but dealers said the recent strong performance of the gold shares was starting to look vulnerable.</p>
