<p>The Sri Lankan rupee closed slightly lower against the dollar on Thursday on late demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee closed at 58.70 to the dollar after opening at 58.68 in the morning and going up to 58.78 during the day, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of deals took place today. Internationally the dollar was moving, so the rupee was also trading in a wide range,&quot; a Commercial Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank pushed up the dollar by 6.50 local cents, fixing buying and selling rates at 57.8556 and 59.0244.</p>
<p>&quot;The market saw no import covering today. But there was export-led selling,&quot; a Standard Chartered Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Overnight call money closed at nine percent after opening at 20 percent with heavy cash withdrawals ahead of next week's Sinhala and Tamil New Year causing volatility in the money market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there is liquidity in the market, some banks are trying to keep money rates high. Which is why money rates were up and down,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
