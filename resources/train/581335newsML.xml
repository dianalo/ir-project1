<p>British advertising agencies are nervously awaiting the outcome of the 23 billion pound ($37 billion) merger between drinks giants Guinness and Grand Metropolitan Plc, industry experts told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think ad agencies hired by either Guinness or Grand Met will be nervously apprehensive about the situation,&quot; said Stefano Hatfield, editor of the trade magazine Campaign.</p>
<p>Tessa Gooding, a spokeswoman for industry association the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) said, &quot;It's obviously early days yet but any merger of clients or change in management is of concern to the ad agencies involved.&quot;</p>
<p>The agencies which may be most affected by the merger are those handling Guinness' and Grand Met's spirits brands if the new combined group, GMG Brands, decides to dispense with any of the brands in its portfolio.</p>
<p>There are currently eight ad agencies employed by either Guinness or Grand Met to run campaigns for spirits brands, plus a number of media buying specialists, sales promotion and direct marketing companies.</p>
<p>Guinness' spirits arm United Distillers, which includes the Gordon's gin and Johnnie Walker brands, spent 10 million pounds on advertising last year. Grand Met's spirits division, International Distillers and Vintners, spent 21 million pounds on advertising in the same period according to figures from A C Nielsen MEAL, which specialises in collecting data on advertising spend.</p>
<p>Most of the agencies involved are adopting a &quot;wait and see approach&quot;.</p>
<p>Tom Bury, chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which runs the Guinness stout account and is owned by WPP Group Plc, said, &quot;It's almost too soon to say what will happen but as far as we are concerned it's business as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Guinness said, &quot;It is far too early to say what will happen with the advertising&quot;.</p>
<p>But industry observers said that the merger may not have an adverse affect on ad agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is unlikely to affect the ad agencies that much because the new group will have a big portfolio of brands,&quot; said Martin Jones managing director of the Advertising Agency Register, an independent company which matches clients with ad agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;it is not like Lloyds Bank and TSB forming Lloyds TSB , where there is only one brand and therefore it needs only one agency,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>David Wethey, director of Agency Assessments, which also acts as a &quot;marriage broker&quot; between clients and ad agencies said, &quot;Quite often with a merger situation there is some shakeout as the client brings accounts under one roof for economies of scale, but given the number of brands they have I don't think that is likely to happen in this case.</p>
