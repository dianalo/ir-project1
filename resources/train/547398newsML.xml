<title>FRANCE: France's Mitterrand consulted astrologer - book.</title>
<headline>France's Mitterrand consulted astrologer - book.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>France's best-known astrologer says in a new book that the late president Francois Mitterrand consulted her regularly in the last years of his rule about his own future and world issues including the Gulf War.</p>
<p>The magazine Paris-Match published extracts from Elizabeth Teissier's book &quot;Sous le signe de Mitterrand&quot; (Under the sign of Mitterrand) on Tuesday with leggy photos of the author, who writes columns on astrology for popular television magazines.</p>
<p>Teissier said Mitterrand, a Scorpio, regularly telephoned her between 1989 and 1994 before major decisions.</p>
<p>It all began when the Socialist head of state invited the sultry astrologer to breakfast at the Elysee presidential palace in 1989 for a long conversation about astrology, Teissier writes.</p>
<p>Mitterrand would begin almost every meeting or telephone call with the question: &quot;How am I and how is France?&quot;</p>
<p>Teissier says she advised the president on such subjects as when the sun, moon and stars would be best aligned for him to address the nation on political issues.</p>
<p>On the day Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Teissier says, he called her from his summer house and asked whether she believed President Saddam Hussein would withdraw his troops.</p>
<p>A few months later, he asked about Saddam's star sign. Teissier said she replied that the Iraqi leader had &quot;the same astrological cocktail as Hitler&quot; -- a Taurus with a Libra ascendant.</p>
<p>Former Mitterrand aides have not commented on the book, although they were aware of its impending publication.</p>
<p>A similar revelation about U.S. President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy prompted howls of outrage in Washington when sacked presidential aide Donald Regan wrote in a 1988 book that they had regularly consulted an astrologist on the timing of key White House moves.</p>
<p>California astrologer Joan Quigley later boasted in interviews that she had advised the Reagans on the timing of superpower summits with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the 1987 signing of a U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons reduction accord.</p>
<p>Teissier's account was the latest in a series of stories that have tarnished Mitterrand's image.</p>
<p>His former personal doctor revealed days after Mitterrand's death in January 1996 that the president had known he had cancer since shortly after his election in 1981 and had hidden it from the public, issuing dishonest medical bulletins.</p>
<p>Just before he died, it emerged that he had an illegitimate daughter by a long-term companion. Both his official family and his &quot;natural&quot; family attended his funeral.</p>
<p>Evidence discovered by investigating magistrates this year indicated that Mitterrand personally supervised the widespread telephone bugging of journalists, lawyers and politicians by an anti-terror unit in his office between 1982 and 1986.</p>
