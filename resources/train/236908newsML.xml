<title>PHILIPPINES: Philippine peso ends up after Central Bank sales.</title>

<p>--------------------------- Dec 5 --------------------------</p>
<p>*Turnover rises to $109.7 million from $102.10 million</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine peso closed higher</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>Thursday at 26.293 to the dollar from the previous 26.297 after</p>
<p>the Central Bank sold about $40 million at 26.297, traders</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>Early in the day, the peso reached a day-low of 26.297 amidst the departure of arbitrage money due to lower domestic interest rates.  </p>
<p>The peso was also earlier pulled down by some $30 million requirement of oil companies which was satisfied at 26.296, traders said.</p>
<p>After demand for dollars eased in the afternoon, the peso eventually gained ground to close at its day-high.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is so liquid. So banks are buying dollars,&quot; a dealer from a medium-sized bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;And there's pressure for fund managers to buy dollars now. They're squaring off their positions here to go to Latin America where interest rates are more attractive,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Traders said remittances from overseas contract workers had eased making the dollar well-bid.</p>
<p>The day's average turned out a slightly weaker peso at 26.296 versus 26.295 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Friday, the peso would likely be weaker due to arbitrage play. The peso's value would be pulled down by the swap points over the weekend which would take into account the interest premium of the peso over the U.S. dollar, a trader said.</p>
