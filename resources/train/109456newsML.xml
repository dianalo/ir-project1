<p>Germany wants Britain to be &quot;at the heart of Europe&quot; as the 15-member bloc seeks a closer union, but London must shift some of its policies to get there, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kinkel, briefing parliament on last week's European Union summit in Dublin, said Germany and France -- the traditional motors of European integration -- would make a joint proposal for further reform by the next EU summit in December.</p>
<p>In an appeal to Britain, he then echoed the pro-European words Prime Minister John Major used during his first visit to Bonn as British leader back in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;We also want to see Britain 'at the heart of Europe' and not on its periphery,&quot; Kinkel said in a speech, adding: &quot;But for that, a few things have to be moved forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Especially since the &quot;mad cow&quot; crisis this spring, many Germans have all but written Major's government off as a partner in Europe and openly expressed hopes that Labour leader Tony Blair will win the next British election.</p>
<p>For their part, Euro-sceptics in Major's ruling party portray Chancellor Helmut Kohl's enthusiastic pro-EU stand as a veiled German bid to gain dominance over the continent.</p>
<p>Despite attacks by Euro-sceptics, Major has tried to preserve Britain's influence in negotiations reviewing the Maastricht treaty by insisting London must have a say in how EU's planned single currency works even if it does not join.</p>
<p>Kinkel did not spell out where he felt Britain had to modify its policies to come more in line with its EU partners.</p>
<p>But his list of priorities for the inter-governmental conference deliberating a reform of the 1991 Maastricht treaty included several points London opposes.</p>
<p>He called for a single European currency in 1999, more majority voting in the EU, a strengthening of the European Parliament and the transformation of the Western European Union (WEU) into the EU's defence arm.</p>
<p>The minister hoped EU members could agree by their Dublin summit in December to cooperate more in regulating immigration and fighting the drug trade, terrorism and organised crime.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is one litmus test our citizens have for Europe's ability to solve its problems, this is it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kinkel also stressed that the so-called flexibility clause, which would let some states forge ahead towards deeper cooperation while others lag behind, must not lead to a &quot;Europe a la carte&quot; in which members went their own ways.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to replace the one European Union with three or four 'special unions',&quot; he argued.  &quot;That would be a bad trade.&quot;</p>
<p>The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) said Britain was not the only state blocking progress in EU integration and accused the Kohl government of slowing down necessary reforms.</p>
<p>Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, the SPD's European affairs spokeswoman, said recent Kohl comments about putting some decisions off for a few years meant the EU would miss reforms needed before it took in new eastern European members.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of this harakiri course will be that only finance ministers and their bureaucrats will have a say in the EU,&quot; she said.  &quot;The political union would have no chance.&quot;</p>
<p>The SPD wanted a &quot;tax union&quot; to harmonise tax levels and ensure that companies could not move production to countries with lower costs, leaving growing unemployment in their wake.</p>
<p>Kinkel saw unemployment as Europe's most pressing problem but rejected the call to put a jobs clause into the EU treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not create a single new job by changing the treaty,&quot; he said.  &quot;That would just distract us from the real challenge all member states must tackle themselves, namely to deregulate, cut their public spending and lower taxes.&quot;</p>
