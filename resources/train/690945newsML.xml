<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in moderate trade on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. weekly jobless claims figures for the week ended June 21, which are forecast to be around 340,000 compared with 347,000 reported in the previous week.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates were steady to a little bit higher in the morning on some position adjustments. Some people are waiting for fresh clues to market direction from tonight's release of the weekly jobless claims data.&quot; a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But I don't think there will be much impact here unless the numbers are way off market expectations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Thursday/Friday, weekend and week-fixed were unchanged from Wednesday's common 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, two-months months rose 1/16 percentage point to 5-3/4 5-5/8 percent.</p>
<p>Four-months was unchanged from Wednesday's 5-3/4 5-5/8 percent, six-months unchanged at 5-7/8 5/3/4 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-1/16 5-15/16 percent.</p>
