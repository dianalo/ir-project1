<p>Secret documents wanted in Germany for the prosecution of a guerrilla follower of &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot; are being withheld for security reasons, a Hungarian prosecutor said on Monday.</p>
<p>Hungary's communist-era archives hold thousands of pages about Carlos and members of his gang who lived in Budapest between 1979 and 1985.</p>
<p>But Laszlo Lang, head of investigations for Hungary's Supreme Prosecution, told Reuters: &quot;The National Security office informed us that the handing over of these documents would violate important foreign political and national security interests of the Hungarian Republic.&quot;</p>
<p>Lang said the documents were wanted by the Court of Justice in Berlin for the upcoming trial of Johannes Weinrich, reputedly Carlos's German deputy. He said he did not know what the documents contained.</p>
<p>The German magazine Der Spiegel reported at the weekend that German prosecutors were seeking 8,500 pages of documents from Hungary, but that the request had been turned down.</p>
<p>The Venezuelan-born Carlos, who is 48 and whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was captured in Sudan in 1994 and is awaiting trial in France.</p>
<p>Carlos was the reputed mastermind of some of the most notorious terrorists attacks of the 1970s and 1980s, including the 1975 kidnapping of 11 OPEC oil ministers in Vienna.</p>
<p>He is to go on trial for the first time on December 12 in France for the murder of two French counter-intelligence officers several months before the OPEC attack.</p>
<p>Carlos was in Hungary several times between 1979 and 1985 and the country's then-communist political leaders at the time tolerated and even supported him.</p>
<p>He was photographed and filmed while in Budapest and, according to published reports, had meetings in Hungary with members of the Italian Red Brigades, the Irish Republic Army and the Basque separatist movement ETA.</p>
<p>In 1991 Hungary's first post-communist government investigated his activities but was unable to determine the extent of Hungary's involvement and dropped its investigation.</p>
