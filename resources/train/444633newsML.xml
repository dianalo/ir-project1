<p>COFFEE - World market for March 13, 1997</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London closed sharply lower following New York's weak performance. Both markets are looking forward to next week's producer talks in London, expected to consider the current high prices and the impact on consumption. One of the main problems which the ACPC meeting is expected to address is the discount at which robusta coffee is trading to arabica.</p>
<p>While the robusta market is oversupplied, arabicas are hard to come by and trade sources said the ACPC meeting had been called at the request of Central American nations which were perhaps seeking to increase the supply of arabica coffee to the market. While the Ivory Coast maintained that extra export cuts of 1.3 mn bags in the first half of 1997 should be fully implemented, Indonesia said the grouping should consider the interests of consumers.</p>
<p>Continued speculative profit-taking in New York pushed arabica futures sharply lower for the second consecutive session amid a slight easing of supply concerns. March lost 13.65 cents/lb to close at 202.00 cents/lb while May shed 13.85 cents/lb to close at 182.25 cents/lb. The outer months lost between 14.50 and 11.75 cents/lb.</p>
<p>Traders cited higher Brazilian exports and the build-up in certified coffee stocks as reasons for the slight easing of supply concerns. However, there can be no doubt that supplies will remain tight especially against the background of the recent scaling down of production estimates.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>KENYA - Drought sweeping through East Africa will reduce Kenya's coffee production to the lowest level in four years, senior industry leaders told Reuters. It was said that due to drought production in 1996/97 (October/September) may be not more than 1.3 mn 60-kg bags, down from 1.626 mn bags produced in 1995/96 and 1.597 mn bags produced in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Apart from the drought coffee berry disease in Kenya's growing areas in June/July 1996 also adversely affected coffee production. Coffee is Kenya's third largest hard currency earner behind tourism and tea and any sharp decline in earnings could undermine its balance of payments position, economists said.</p>
<p>However, lower production may not mean lower export revenues due to the recent sharp increase in world market prices. Kenya exported 1.823 mn 60-kg bags of coffee in 1995/96 (including carryover stocks), earning 16.3 bn shillings ($302.9 mn), compared to 1.325 mn bags in 1994/95 worth 14.4 bn shillings.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - The United States imported 1.986 mn bags of coffee in December 1996, 18 per cent more than was imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports in calendar year 1996 up to 19.434 mn bags, which compares to 17.105 mn bags imported in 1995 and 16.169 mn bags imported in 1994.</p>
<p>Main suppliers of green coffee in 1996 were Guatemala (1.748 vs 1.637 mn bags), Mexico (3.734 vs 2.887 mn bags), Brazil (1.852 vs 2.302 mn bags), Colombia (3.011 vs 2.485 mn bags), Indonesia (1.246 vs 0.513 mn bags) and Vietnam (1.081 vs 0.975 mn bags).</p>
<p>The country exported 2.047 mn bags of coffee in 1996, up from 1.841 mn bags exported the previous year but down on the 1994 figure of 2.347 mn bags.</p>
