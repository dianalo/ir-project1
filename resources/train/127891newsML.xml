<p>Magnum Power Solutions Inc said on Friday it named Brian McGhee chairman and also raised 3.43 million stg net through a share placement.</p>
<p>The designer of built-in uninterruptible power supplies said McGhee would succeed Douglas Hume as chairman.</p>
<p>Hume will remain on the board.</p>
<p>The company also said in its statement that it conditionally placed 18 million new ordinary shares with institutional shareholders at 20p per share.  </p>
<p>Magnum's shares fell 2.0p to 24-1/2 in morning trade.</p>
<p>The company said it had almost exhausted its cash resources, but added that the placing will provide sufficient finance to allow Magnum to continue to pursue its goals.</p>
<p>The new shares will constitute 28.3 percent of the company's enlarged ordinary share capital.</p>
<p>The company said contracts to supply significant volumes of its BI-UPS products had yet to be concluded, although it added that it had made progress on the matter.  </p>
<p>Of its three main customers, two continued to place orders at the level of their initial commitment or better, while the third was currently at an advanced stage in its internal evaluation of a prototype, Magnum said.</p>
<p>It added it expected its new standard electronic point-of-sale product to be in production in April 1997 and its new high-end file server product to be in production by June.</p>
<p>&quot;Contracts for significant volumes will be concluded and will make a contribution to revenues in the near future,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>It also said co-founder Vincent Lavin stepped down as a director but would serve as a consultant.</p>
<p>Magnum added it planned to propose options packages &quot;to retain and motivate&quot; senior management.</p>
<p>The company also applied for its ordinary shares to be admitted to the Alternative Investment Market. The company scheduled an extraordinary shareholders meeting for November 13 to approve the measures.</p>
