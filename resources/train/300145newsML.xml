<p>The National Governors' Association is debating whether to ask Congress to restore some of the aid to legal immigrants cut by a new welfare law, a move that has lawmakers concerned, sources said Thursday.</p>
<p>Association aides are drafting a policy statement, to be considered by governors at a national meeting next month, taking issue with cuts affecting elderly and disabled immigrants and refugees, congressional and state sources said.</p>
<p>Aides cautioned that the statement, part of a broader package of policies to be debated, was still in the drafting stage and had not yet been sent to governors for review.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders and some key Democrats have said they do not want to reopen the welfare law. Republican staffers met with state governors' aides Wednesday to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;There's disagreement here,&quot; said one aide involved in the meeting. &quot;We worked very closely for two years (on the welfare bill) ... This was always a very difficult issue.&quot;</p>
<p>About $23 billion of $54 billion in six years of savings under the welfare law come from denying Food Stamps, disability and other federal aid to legal immigrants. Benefits could end for hundreds of thousands of immigrants this summer.</p>
<p>President Clinton has also said the immigrant cutoff goes too far, and he is expected to address the issue in his 1998 budget to be submitted to Congress next month.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, in a Wednesday speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce acknowledged the issue was problemmatic.</p>
<p>&quot;In welfare reform we have some governors that are already saying, 'Oh my goodness, what you have done in welfare reform with regard to legal immigrants is creating problems for our state,'&quot; Lott said. &quot;I do think personally it would be a mistake to start fiddling with welfare reform.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans say publicly they do not want to revisit the issue, although privately some discuss a limited fix for immigrants.</p>
<p>At the Governors Association, staff aides are working on the policy statement, which will be distributed to governors for review 15 days before the Feb. 2 meeting. A draft focuses on elderly and disabled refugees in the United States before the welfare law went into effect, but who will not be able to obtain citizenship and will lose benefits.</p>
