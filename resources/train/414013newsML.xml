<headline>Chronimed says FDA resolves Quick Check issue.</headline>
<dateline>MINNETONKA, Minn. 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chronimed Inc said Monday a resolution has been reached between its Quick Check reagent strip supplier and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding a shipment hold.</p>
<p>Chronimed said the resolution involves a plan for the gradual restart of Quick Check shipments.</p>
<p>By this plan, Chronimed said it expects to avoid the full financial effects of a complete loss of product shipments in its third fiscal quarter, which was cited as a possibility in announcements made in January.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are very happy about moving ahead even though there are still a few loose ends,&quot; Maurice Taylor II, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. &quot;Quite importantly, the resolution squashes speculation in the marketplace that the FDA investigation of the Quick Check would result in a product recall.  We have been definitively informed that there will be no recall.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, Chronimed said its supplier has been authorized to begin immediate shipment of reagent strips from certain on-hand production lots.  </p>
<p>Inventory in other on-hand lots will be evaluated for shipment after further testing is completed.  When this testing will be completed is still not certain, it added.</p>
<p>Production of new strips is expected to begin in the next few weeks, with a ramp up to normal production occurring over approximately two months, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;The FDA investigations did uncover some procedural matters that needed addressing, and this is underway,&quot; Taylor said.  </p>
<p>In a separate matter, Chronimed also announced that it has received notification from the FDA of registration for its Supreme II blood glucose monitor.  This monitor, which has advanced features compared with the monitor it is replacing, uses the Supreme reagent strip manufactured by the company.</p>
<p>Chronimed said it revised its forecast for the third quarter, projecting revenues of $28 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.08 to $0.10.</p>
<p>The adverse effect in the third quarter of less than full shipments of the Quick Check is estimated to be approximately $3 million in revenue and $0.05 in earnings per share, it said.</p>
<p>For the full fiscal year ending in June, revenues are forecasted to be more than $120 million and earnings to be about $0.50 per share, it added.</p>
