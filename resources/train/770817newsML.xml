<title>NETHERLANDS: Analysts' comments on KNP BT H1 results.</title>
<headline>Analysts' comments on KNP BT H1 results.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-07-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch paper, packaging and office products group KNP BT on Thursday reported 1997 first half net profits after extraordinary items rose 56 million guilders to 157 million guilders. The company maintained its forecast of a substantial rise in full-year profits.</p>
<p>Below is a selection of analysts' comments:</p>
<p>PIETER VAN GELDER, DELTA LLOYD BANK:</p>
<p>&quot;Underlying, this is not the improvement we had hoped for. Distribution and packaging are not the activities which will show a huge profit jump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most improvement had to be expected of the KNP Leykam unit. But with overcapacity in woodfree coated paper, lightweight coated paper prices below last year's level and pulp prices on the rise, it does not look like KNP Leykam will generate a big rise in profits in the second half of this year. The unit showed an improvement, but it comes from a very low base and margins are likely to be pressured. We rated the stock a sell and will keep it at that, unless the analysts' meeting provides us with details that point to a brighter future.&quot;  </p>
<p>JOHAN VAN DEN HOOVEN, NIB SECURITIES:</p>
<p>&quot;In total, the results were at the top end of consensus, although there was a 20 million extraordinary gain. Revenues were slightly above expectations mainly because of higher volumes. Prices are not that good yet. Margins are not very healthy, but they are improving. It depends on whether paper price increases are sustainable. Restructuring measures are also paying off. However, there was nothing said about the solution for KNP Leykam. It is still looking for a partner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The forecast is the same as it was half a year ago and the paper performance is not that promising. If they do the same in the second half as in the first that will be a disappointment. The outlook is not that strong.&quot;</p>
<p>THIBAUD DE GUERRE, ING BARINGS:</p>
<p>&quot;The second quarter result was just below our expectation, but there's no reason to change our estimates. Prices at KNP Leykam rose slightly compared with last year which led to improved results and I expect that profitability to remain. It looks like the packaging division will perform better in the second half thanks to increased prices. Volume growth if you take out currency effects and acquisition is somewhat meagre and disappointing. Within the distribution division, margins at graphical and distribution systems were pressured, but can recover in the second half. We will maintain our Hold rating.&quot;</p>
