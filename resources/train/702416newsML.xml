<title>BANGLADESH: Dhaka stocks close down on selling pressure.</title>
<headline>Dhaka stocks close down on selling pressure.</headline>
<dateline>DHAKA 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dhaka stocks extended Monday's fall as selling grew stronger ahead of Thurday's general strike, called by main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) all-share price index lost 13.2 points or 1.18 percent at 1,098.35 on a turnover of 48.9 million taka on Wednesday. Losers led gainers by 99 to 29.</p>
<p>&quot;The market suffers from a cash crisis. Banks are constantly putting pressure on us to repay loan. Strike threat has further dampened the sentiment,&quot; said broker Shahidullah Shamoyl.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was unlikely to operate on Thursday due to the strike called to protest taxes in the new 1997/98 budget.</p>
<p>They also linked the selling to investors trying to mobilise cash for investment on some IPOs currently on offer.</p>
<p>Singer Bangladesh lost heavily for the second straight session down 141 taka to 5,907, followed by United Leasing Company that fell 77 to 2,549. Monno Ceramic Industries gained 8.09 to 817.34 as the company said it would start production soon. The industry remain closed since 21 June amid a labour unrest.</p>
