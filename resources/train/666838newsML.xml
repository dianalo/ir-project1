<p>The Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) is starting to buck the downward trend of recent weeks and could soon test its traditional resistance level of 190 from the present 185, Laiki Investments brokerage has said in a weekly report.</p>
<p>The Laiki Investment index, set in 1993 at 100 points, closed on Friday 13 at 185.3, after 182.97 on Monday, June 9.</p>
<p>The CSE trades in 87 securities from 43 listed companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The 10 day moving average has reversed its recent downward trend and is now moving on an upward trend currently at around 183 units,&quot; said Laiki Investments, which is a subsidiary of the Cyprus Popular Bank.</p>
<p>In a weekly technical analysis, Laiki Investents said that because of the very recent reversal in the trend on the bourse, the 30 day moving average is still moving downwards. If current trends persist, however, the 30 day moving average may start moving upwards, Laiki said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also important that while the 30 day moving average reverses its downward trend, the 10 day moving average gathers pace and overtakes it thus giving signs of bettering market conditions,&quot; said Laiki.</p>
<p>The 200 day long term moving average is still hovering around 190 units, the same as it was last week, and is currently waiting for the market upturn to gather pace in order to start moving upwards, Laiki said.</p>
