<p>The European Union's senior agricultural civil servant visited Paris on Tuesday for talks with the government on proposed sweeping farm reforms which French farmers have vowed to resist.</p>
<p>French officials said Guy Legras, director-general for agriculture at the EU's executive Commission, met European Affairs Minister Pierre Moscovici to present the fine print of the EU's Agenda 2000 plan announced in Brussels this month.</p>
<p>France's Socialist-led government, elected in June, has already urged the Commission to make serious changes to the plan, which would cut guaranteed prices to help the 15-nation EU prepare for expansion towards former East Bloc countries.</p>
<p>France believes the price cuts would be a sign of weakness ahead of further liberalising trade negotiations with the United States due in 1999. But on a previous visit to Paris two weeks ago, Legras said EU negotiators would be helped not hindered by arriving at those talks with domestic reforms already under way.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately released on Tuesday's meeting, held at the French Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>French farm unions, who staged massive protests against previous reforms in 1992, when the last Socialist government was in office, have called the new price cuts &quot;unacceptable&quot; and pledged a campaign against them.</p>
