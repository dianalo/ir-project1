<p>South Africa's stock market aims to boost efficiency and become more transparent in order to survive in the increasingly cut-throat global marketplace, exchange president Russell Loubser told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>With exchange controls and tariff barriers tumbling around the world, all forms of capital are becoming more mobile. So are the traders that deal in it.</p>
<p>Loubser said the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), virtually isolated during the apartheid era, now had to compete for business internationally.</p>
<p>&quot;We are moving to a culture where we are going to remove all exchange controls. Traders will come and trade where the market is most efficient and where the transparency is the best,&quot; Loubser said in an interview.</p>
<p>Loubser said isolation could no longer be used as an excuse for some of the anachronisms of the JSE -- which celebrates its 110th birthday later this year.</p>
<p>The JSE, which dwarfs any other stock market in Africa, has scrapped its old trading floor and imported a hi-tech electronic dealing system called JET.</p>
<p>JET has ironed out most of its early technical problems and is now up and running. &quot;It has still got faults, but they will be corrected over time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Having banished paper slips from dealing the JSE also aims to computerise its less front-line operations by working with banks to set up an electronic scrip registry. This would automatically register changes in share-ownership without the need for physically shifting masses of certificates around.</p>
<p>&quot;First we must stop the paper being mobile. Therefore we must get those scrip papers filed centrally and keep them there,&quot; Loubser said.</p>
<p>The certificates could then be replaced with an electronic registry, which could be in place in 1998.</p>
<p>Loubser, who replaced former JSE President Roy Andersen at the start of this month, said greater co-operation was needed between the JSE and South Africa's two other licensed exchanges -- the South African Futures Exchange and the Bond Exchange.</p>
<p>This would allow cross surveillance of the three markets and allow players with offsetting positions in more than one exchange to calculate net risks and net margins.</p>
<p>&quot;The technology is there. A lot of negotiations are needed between the JSE and the other markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One dark cloud on the JSE's horizon is South Africa's unwanted reputation for insider trading. One recent case that caused a stir followed the apparent leaking of news of a big shake-up at car firm Automakers Ltd earlier this month.</p>
<p>The firm's shares shot up ahead of news that majority shareholder Sankorp would make a payout to minorities at a substantial premium to the prevailing market price.</p>
<p>Loubser said South African law, which still only deals with the equities market, makes insider trading a criminal rather than civil offence. This places a higher burden of proof on an area of crime that is already notoriously difficult to trace.</p>
<p>However, a government-appointed committee into the issue is set to announce its recommendations in the next few weeks and is expected to suggest the law be changed.</p>
<p>The JSE also plans to install by April the Stock Exchange News Service which will rapidly transmit price-sensitive information to clients in a way similar to that used on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>This will replace the current archaic mixture of company's conveying news by faxed press releases or placing adverts in local newspapers -- with all the attendant delays. &quot;It is not just changing the legislation to catch insider trading, it is about removing the ability in the first place,&quot; Loubser said.</p>
