<headline>HK's Hang Seng Index closes at all-time high.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-07-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at an all-time high on Thursday, as investors poured into the property sector boosting turnover to its highest level ever.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index surged 382.53 points, or 2.39 percent, to close at 16,365.71.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$28.03 billion, up from HK$21.69 billion on Wednesday and beating the previous record of HK$26.6 billion set on June 20.</p>
<p>&quot;With a chart breakout on record volume there is only one way we are going: 17,000,&quot; said James Osborn, sales director at ING Barings.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very healthy market. The utilities had been strong and there is rotation into the property developers which is spreading out into second and third liners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng properties sub-index charged well ahead of the blue chip index, rising 4.10 percent to 27,116.55 points.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were encouraged by the response to recent property sales by Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd and Swire Pacific Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;Property developers had been oversold. People are seeing huge end-user demand in the property market without the speculators and prices are stable. This is the perfect scenario,&quot; said Osborn.</p>
<p>Shares in Cheung Kong bounded HK$5.25 to HK$86.00 and Swire Pacific jumped HK$4.00 to HK$73.50.</p>
<p>&quot;People are quite optmistic about a rebound in residential property prices in the next few months. Property stocks tend to move ahead of the prices of residential units,&quot; said Henry Lui, research analyst at Mansion House Research.</p>
<p>Alex Wong, technical analyst at Dharmala Securities, said the property stocks may be overbought in the short term and the Hang Seng Index could find resistance at 16,500 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The index has consolidated in a range of 15,630 to 15,880 points recently and broke out of the range yesterday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we saw some follow-through but we may see some profit-taking over the next one or two days ahead of HSBC's results and U.S. employment data on Friday,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Osborn saw the Hang Seng Index testing 16,800 points early next week. &quot;We may have a look at 17,000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc advanced HK$7.00 to HK$270.00. The banking giant is due to report interim results on Monday.</p>
<p>China Southern Airlines Co Ltd made its market debut and closed at HK$4.875 compared with an issue price of HK$4.70.</p>
<p>CCT Telecom Holdings Ltd soared HK$0.43 to HK$1.78 after it said it would set up joint venture companies in China with a company partly owned by China's Ministry of Electronics Industry.</p>
