<p>The weakening Thai baht, the release of key central bank data and expected poor corporate results in the energy and telecommunication sector are set to dampen the Thai bourse this week, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The stock index, which closed Friday at 848.56, is likely to move in a narrow range of 830-860, they said, with sentiment at the start of the week likely to be dominated by the baht.</p>
<p>The currency weakened to over five-year lows of more than 25.80 baht against the surging dollar last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a weakening baht/dollar will probably dampen the sentiment of the market this week,&quot; Tanawat Patchimkul of Seamico Securities told Reuters.</p>
<p>The weakening currency will tighten liquidity in the money markets and reduce the likelihood of interest rates cuts in the short term, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the baht continues to depreciate against the dollar then maybe then money market liquidity should tighten with a negative affect on the equity market,&quot; said Somchai Trairattanapirom, vice-president at Sitca Investment and Securities.</p>
<p>With Thai interest rates among the highest in Asia at over 13.00 percent, investors are looking for a rate cut to stimulate the slowing economy and corporate growth.</p>
<p>Investors were also likely to remain cautious ahead of Bank of Thailand economic statistics due for release on Thursday, analysts said. They will be looking for the preliminary data for December to show signs of improvement in Thailand's monthly current account deficit and export figures.</p>
<p>The current account deficit is privately forecast at between 8.2 and 8.4 percent of GDP in 1996 against 8.2 percent in 1995, and the country's declining export performance is predicted to be static in 1996 against a 24 percent rise in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The BOT economic data will be a major factor on the market this week. Maybe there will be a little bit of nervousness ahead of that,&quot; said James Marshall, head of reserach at Capital Nomura Securities.</p>
<p>Though the index is expected to move in a narrow range, corporate results from the energy and telecommunications sectors were likely to keep daily trade volatile, analysts said.</p>
<p>On the positive side, there was evidence of renewed foreign interest in the Thai equity market last week, although it may be premature ahead of any hard evidence of a recovery, Marshall said.</p>
<p>While the SET Index dipped at the end of the week to close at 848.56, it had reached 858.97 on Wednesday, its highest level since December 17. Market volumes averaging 4.4 billion baht per day were the highest so far this month.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people out there are looking at the Thai market with a view to making a decision...just because of what we are saying doesn't mean they'll be deterred,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;A lot of investors are anticipating a recovery and by the time the good news filters through, they worried it might be too late.&quot;</p>
