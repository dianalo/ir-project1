<title>GERMANY: German debt and futures seen down ahead of Fed mtg.</title>
<headline>German debt and futures seen down ahead of Fed mtg.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-08-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>German Bunds and futures were firmer in morning dealings, underpinned by tame German M3 money supply data for July and the Bundesbank keeping the weekly securities repurchase, or repo, fixed at three percent.</p>
<p>At 0800 GMT, DTB September Bund futures were up six basis points at 102.67 and near the session high of 102.70.</p>
<p>Debt futures erased early losses, tied to a revision in German manufacturing data, on M3, which showed annualised growth at 5.7 percent against the 1996 fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The M3 data was within the bank's target corridor and prompted economists to predict no near-term rate action.  </p>
<p>September Bund futures also got a boost when the contract broke resistance at 102.63, which drew in fresh buyers as the contract zeroed in on stiffer resistance at 102.68.</p>
<p>But dealers expected consolidation between 102.19 and 102.68 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve FOMC policy meeting on Tuesday. No U.S. interest rate change is expected.</p>
<p>Also on tap is Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting.</p>
<p>The M3 data led some economists to predict that the Bundesbank would keep key interest rates, including the repo, fixed at current levels and not switch to a variable-rate repo, as some had expected as a way to counter the weak mark.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is very nice for the Bundesbank as it means they can hold off on an interest rate move for the time being,&quot; said Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt of July M3.</p>
