<title>NIGERIA: Nigerian police link opposition to Lagos car bomb.</title>

<p>Nigerian police have linked victims of a car bomb explosion two weeks ago to exiled opposition leader Wole Soyinka, local newspapers reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Police chiefs told reporters on Thursday that their investigations revealed that two of the victims, Lagos airport security chief Sola Omotshola and his cousin Nelson Gbolahan Kazeem, were working for the opposition when they blew themselves up by mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;Nelson Kazeem was a sabotage agent working for Wole Soyinka's National Liberation Council, a military wing of NADECO,&quot; said airport police commander Mohammed Abubakar.</p>
<p>NADECO's octogenerian leader Michael Ajasin refuted the police allegation, telling the papers: &quot;We are not violent, we have never been violent and we will never be violent.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't carry bombs and no one carried bombs on our behalf,&quot; he said from his home in Owo, southwestern Nigeria.</p>
<p>Nobel laureate Soyinka is in exile and opposes the military government because of the annulment of a 1993 presidential poll.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred near Murtala Muhammed International Airport on November 14 killing Omotshola, Kazeem and an unidentified woman.</p>
<p>&quot;It is believed that Kazeem was carrying the bomb on his lap on the way back to the airport when it exploded in his face, tearing his face into two,&quot; Abubakar said.</p>
<p>He said police found explosive devices including dynamite and four detonators when they searched Omotshola's office.</p>
<p>They also found in the office a travelling bag belonging to Kazeem which contained letters and a cheque addressed to retired army brass Lieutenant-General Alani Akinrinade, a member of the exiled wing of NADECO in London, he said.</p>
<p>There have been a spate of murders of high-profile individuals, including the killing in June of the senior wife of detained Moshood Abiola, the wealthy businessman presumed to have won the annulled vote.</p>
