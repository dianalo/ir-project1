<headline>BA denies EC demanding that it give up slots.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>British Airways on Friday dismissed a report that the European Commission had demanded that it give up a third of the runway slots it uses for U.S. flights at London Heathrow as a condition for approving its proposed alliance with American Airlines.</p>
<p>British newspaper The Independent said the Commission was demanding the concession in proposals submitted to British Airways last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Any suggestions that we are ready to or have been told to give up slots is premature and indeed we would oppose any request of that kind,&quot; a company spokesman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have said all along that we do not believe that there is any justification for concessions on slots,&quot; he said. &quot;We feel that would be unfair because other carriers have not been forced to give up any slots at their home airports to get their alliance agreements approved.&quot;</p>
<p>BA said it had received a document from the Commission but this concerned the wider-ranging review that the Commission is conducting of all alliances between EU and U.S. airlines, which it started several months ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The EC has come back to us with a document for our comment,&quot; the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is merely the EC following usual procedures and carrying out the study it announced months ago into all alliances between European airlines and U.S. carriers,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;So we would expect similar documents have been served on Lufthansa SAS, Swissair, Sabena, Austrian and KLM,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Industry sources said it was doubtful in any case whether the Commission had any jurisdiction to vet the BA/American deal, and it was really a matter for the British and U.S. governments.  </p>
<p>&quot;What they (the EC) will actually do with the results of their studies is somewhat perplexing because under EU law all they (the EC) can do is authorise the UK government to take action under its own (competition) laws and obviously the UK is already doing that,&quot; said one source.</p>
<p>The industry has been waiting for British trade minister Ian Lang to decide whether or not to block the deal ever since his Office of Fair Trading (OFT) completed an investigation into the competition issues on September 17.  </p>
<p>Lang declared in July that the UK would be examining the proposed alliance between BA and American under both European Union as well as British competition rules.</p>
<p>Industry sources said he is expected to make his ruling in the week of November 18, now that the U.S. and Britain have postponed from that week to December 4 the resumption of related &quot;open skies' negotiations to open up their transatlantic aviation market to free competition.</p>
