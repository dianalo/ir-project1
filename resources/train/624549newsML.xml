<p>French Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin said in a Thursday newspaper interview, ahead of Sunday's runoff election, that his party backed Europe's planned single currency and this would be the position of a left-wing government.</p>
<p>&quot;We are for the single currency, since the outset. One can be against the single currency and that's a respectable stance but it would not be the position of a government,&quot; Jospin told afternoon daily newspaper Le Monde.</p>
<p>He was replying to a question about differences of position on the left, which took a lead in a first round vote in France's parliamentary election last Sunday. The smaller Communist party opposes the European monetary union plan and wants a referendum on the euro.</p>
<p>Jospin, whose rhetoric is being closely watched by markets for signals on the power balance on the left and how pragmatist a leftish government would be, also said his party's call for a shorter 35-hour work week to promote employment would not be something that happened immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;On the 35-hour week, it's not 35 hours right away. We have to be clear on this. We have a three-year schedule, starting with a framework law, and then the opening of negotiations between the social partners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The traditional caricatures of a Socialist-Communist coalition are not longer valid, we're not longer in the same period of history,&quot; Jospin said.</p>
<p>Asked if he feared a mobilisation of the right-wing vote in the second round after the left's first round lead, Jospin said: &quot;I'm not counting out anything. This is a two-round poll. I do not think the dynamic should reverse but nothing's wrapped up&quot;.</p>
<p>Jospin also took a stab at the latest electoral manoeuvres on the right after the joint campaign-trail appearance of the socially-minded Philippe Seguin and free-marketeer Alain Madelin days ahead of the decisive second round vote.</p>
<p>While Seguin is widely seen as a more populist and socially minded player than outgoing prime minister Alain Juppe, Madelin is seen as one of the most ardent economic liberals on the French centre-right and was ousted by Juppe from the job of finance minister in 1995 after his firebrand style infuriated trade unions.</p>
<p>&quot;This unlikely duo adds to the theatre of confusion and I think the French people will read it this way,&quot; Jospin said.</p>
<p>&quot;They have not forgotten that he (Madelin) was removed from government within three months. They know that Mr Seguin is his opposite,&quot; he said.</p>
