<p>Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders resume U.N.-sponsored talks on Monday following steps toward partial integration of the northern portion of the divided island with Turkey.</p>
<p>The Montreux, Switzerland, meeting between Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash is the second round of talks aimed at reuniting the militarily divided island under a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation -- a feat that has eluded mediators for decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously it (the move toward partial integration) is not helpful but I think we have to keep our eye on the ball...which is that everybody has agreed that what we are seeking is in terms of an overall settlement: one country, a federation, bi-communal, bi-zonal,&quot; said Gustave Feissel, the U.N. resident representative in Cyprus.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say that not only the two communities, but all concerned -- and that obviously means in particular Turkey and Greece -- are expected to actively support what is going on in order that we can make progress,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ankara agreed with Turkish Cypriot officials last week to work toward integration of economic and defence policies, but the idea faces opposition among many Turkish Cypriots.</p>
<p>Although it filed a protest with the ambassadors representing the five permanent members of the Security Council, Cyprus responded mildly to the agreement.</p>
<p>Clerides said it was aimed at goading his government into not attending the Switzerland talks and was for &quot;internal consumption.&quot;</p>
<p>Western diplomats dismissed it as a bargaining chip.</p>
<p>European Union entry talks are looming for Cyprus early next year, and the Greek Cypriot-led government is due next summer to deploy a Russian anti-aircraft missile system Ankara has vowed to block.</p>
<p>Observers say the two events make the need for a solution to the dispute that has kept the Mediterranean island's Greeks and Turks estranged for decades more pressing than ever.</p>
<p>At Montreux, the two leaders are expected to submit their observations to a &quot;non-paper&quot; given to them at the first round in Troutbeck, New York, last month by Diego Cordovez, the U.N. special adviser for Cyprus.</p>
<p>If endorsed by the two sides, the document would take the form of a joint declaration and outline principles upon which a comprehensive solution should be based.</p>
<p>It would call on the two communities to commit themselves to a sustained process of open-ended, direct negotiations.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since troops from Turkey took over the north of the island in 1974 in reaction to a coup in Nicosia backed by the junta then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>The Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own state in 1983 with Denktash as president but it is recognised only by Ankara.</p>
<p>Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been estranged since 1963, three years after independence from Britain, when a government representing both communities broke apart amid violence that resulted in the dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force that is still on the island.</p>
<p>Despite the continued stalemate, the political climate has taken a significant turn for the better in recent months.</p>
<p>Last year Cyprus was wracked by violence in which several people lost their lives along the 180-kilometre (112-mile) U.N. buffer zone that splits the island east to west.</p>
<p>Today, in a series of reciprocal goodwill gestures, some restrictions on people meeting from both sides of the ceasefire line have been eased.</p>
<p>But politically, deep-rooted differences remain on issues relating to sovereignty, security, and the question of Cyprus's accession to the EU.</p>
<p>Entry talks are scheduled to take place next year. Turkey has warned it will unite with the north if the EU talks begin next year.</p>
<p>Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots, who do not recognise the Cyprus government, say it cannot negotiate EU membership for the entire island.</p>
<p>They say international agreements which established the Cyprus Republic in 1960 bar the island from joining any institution to which guarantor power Turkey does not belong.</p>
<p>Britain and Greece, the other two guarantor powers, are members of the European Union.</p>
<p>Turkey has been an associate member of the EU since 1963. It applied for full membership in 1987 but has seen Cyprus and nations in eastern Europe leapfrog it in the queue due to its ailing economy and poor human rights record.</p>
