<p>Socialist Prime Minister Costas Simitis's victory over his conservative opposition challenger on Sunday came as no surprise to most financial analysts.</p>
<p>Brokers are expecting a firmer bourse on Monday, softer interest rates in the money market and foreign exchange coming into the country to buy high-yielding Treasury bills after the socialist win.</p>
<p>&quot;In the short term I see higher prices in the stock market but profit-taking by those who had bet on a socialist win should also take place on Monday,&quot; said Alexander Moraitakis, Managing Director of Nuntius Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't necessarily be an explosive day. It's buy the rumour, sell the news. Pasok's prevalence was expected, it was not a surprise. The magnitude of profit-taking will play a role tomorrow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Conservative opposition leader Miltiades Evert conceded defeat and resigned as party leader once he saw the scale of the victory.</p>
<p>Simitis will have a solid absolute majority of around 162 deputies in the 300-seat parliament and with a fresh four-year mandate, he will pick the cabinet he wants.</p>
<p>One position which will be watched closely is that of Finance Minister Alexandros Papadopoulos, who has indicated that he would lik to move. There have also been suggestions that the finance ministry and national economy ministry might be merged.</p>
<p>Financial analysts were focusing on developments in the conservative camp and on the makeup of parliament which will include three small left-wing parties.</p>
<p>Privatisations in the state banks sector should be expected in the near future, analysts forecast. But National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou is likely to be reappointed and pursue his slowly-slowly approach to privatising.</p>
<p>The result was confirmation of most market expectations despite the neck-and-neck race that developed towards the end of the campaign, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Simitis got the message that Greeks have matured politically expecting him to now move forward with results regardless of political cost. A new chapter begins on Monday,&quot; John Marcopoulos, Managing Director of Sigma Securities said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a positive signal for the bourse, I expect the stock market to open strong and stabilise in the 900-1,000 range in the very near future with a good chance to finally break the 1,000 barrier down the road,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the money market, with the hard drachma policy expected to stay intact, foreign funds were expected to keep coming into the country to take advantage of high-yield Treasury bills and easing of medium- to longer-term interbank rates were likely.</p>
<p>&quot;A first reaction will be softer one-year depos, down to 13.00-13.10 from 13.30 percent now, with a more marked 50 basis point drop in one-month rates,&quot; said George Kontogiannis, head of money market operations at Kappa Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The hard drachma stance is a fact. Forex inflows will be lighter since the drachma has appreciated against the Ecu and has a slide margin of around 1.7 percent to stick to its target. The profit incentive for position-building is there but it is smaller,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Part-privatisations and streamlining of the public sector along with faster, more efficient absorption of Community Support Framework (CSF) funds and progress on key infrastructure projects would be positive for financial markets, other analysts said.</p>
