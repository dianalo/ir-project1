<headline>Coffee seen near peaks after rally, may pause.</headline>

<p>Coffee prices could be near their immediate peaks and long overdue for a pause following a new rally this week that propelled New York arabica types to 2-1/2 year highs.</p>
<p>But analysts said on Thursday this would not alter the current bullish trend developed since early January and exacerbated by prospects of tight arabica supplies from the Americas.</p>
<p>New York May futures for arabica coffee beans traded above $2 per pound on Wednesday for the first time since 1994 when supply was tight after the severe frosts in Brazil.</p>
<p>The May coffee has since slipped back to below $2.00 and by Thursday afternoon it was trading at a low of $1.98. It hit a high of nearly $2.10 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Arabica prices have risen by more than 50 percent since early January. Prices of London's well-supplied robusta types have also soared by 50 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>Both London and New York finished firm on Wednesday but were well below their day's highs and traders said the continued price volatility would keep market players nervous.</p>
<p>UK brokerage GNI Ltd in a commentary on Thursday said the market could be nearing its peak but added it was still hard to pinpoint any firm direction.</p>
<p>&quot;...but as action (on Wednesday) shows, this is not a game to be played by the faint hearted,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>A senior executive at a major international roaster agreed, saying that coffee was poised to hit a top.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a vacuum of buying. Furthermore, a downward correction is long overdue but it can still go higher again at some point,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He saw $1.40-$1.50 as the immediate downside objective unless commodity funds decide to drastically liquidate their sizeable long positions and take profits.</p>
<p>Others took a more bullish view, saying that the market was not topping out and that it had more room on the upside.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no good quality arabicas around,&quot; one London coffee analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Worries about the Brazilian frost will push the market higher. The fact that the market stays strong at this time of the year suggests that it has some more to go,&quot; the analyst added.</p>
<p>In 1994, Brazil, the world's top coffee grower, was struck by frosts in June and July which needed just a few days to drive London's futures prices to over $4,000 a tonne from pre-frost levels of $2,269.</p>
<p>Already, Brazilian production is widely expected to trend lower this year and none of other major arabica producers expects to reap a bumper harvest.</p>
<p>The robusta prices are now hovering at $1,730, down from a nine-month-high of $1,820 on Wednesday, but up sharply from a low of $1,203 earlier this year.</p>
<p>Despite the rally, robusta values continued to trail the premium arabica prices with the robusta discount holding at record low of over $1.20.</p>
<p>While the fundamental supply picture for robustas looked less bright with the onset of a large Indonesian harvest, but they could gain from a surge in demand from roasters switching from arabicas.</p>
<p>Major roasters, maintaining a policy of low inventories, have been forced to buy not only to fill the pipeline but also to cover demand, thus providing further ammunition to rallying prices.</p>
<p>Most arabica origins seemed to have been well sold and there was very little coffee left to offer for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;But some suggested that roasters are still short,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
