<headline>NYMEX electricity closes up with Western outages.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-23</dateline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures closed higher Monday primarily on coal and nuclear power outages in the West, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palo Verde (nuclear) unit is down, and I think that had a bit of a bullish effect,&quot; said one futures broker.</p>
<p>Arizona Public Service's 1,221 megawatt nuclear unit 1 in Wintersburg, Ariz. was taken off line over the weekend for refueling and maintenance that has been scheduled to last about 44 days.</p>
<p>Other coal units were reported to be off line in Washington and Montana, helping to boost spot electricity prices through the West on Monday.</p>
<p>October California Oregon Border (COB) futures settled up 37 cents at $15.84 after trade as low as $15.60, while November finished up 25 cents at $16.70 from trade as low as $16.55 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>Remaining COB deferreds settled 10 cents higher.</p>
<p>October Palo Verde (PV) closed up 43 cents at $16.43 after trade as low as $16.05 per MWh, while November ended up 10 cents at $15.25 after trade in five cent range.</p>
<p>December was the only remaining PV month to trade, closing up five cents at $16.75 per MWh.</p>
<p>NYMEX said an estimated 286 COB and 53 PV contracts traded Monday.</p>
