<p>The Irish government, facing a June 6 election and trailing opposition parties in the opinion polls, is set to propose a 1.5 billion Irish pounds package of tax cuts over five years, Irish newspapers reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The Irish Times said the proposals would be unveiled shortly. It said they included a 50 percent rise in tax-free allowances and a rise of more than a quarter in the standard 26 percent income tax band to ensure that less income was taxed at the higher rate.</p>
<p>The Irish Times said the government was also expected to announce a cut in the top income tax rate to 45 percent from 48 percent at present.</p>
<p>The Irish Independent said the opposition parties were also expected to unveil their tax plans on Friday.</p>
<p>The government's proposals follow the ruling coalition's &quot;21 Goals for the 21st Century&quot; plan unveiled on Thursday.</p>
<p>That pledged, among other commitments, to advance the Northern Ireland all-party peace talks, and ensure fair distribution between tax reform, better public services and lower borrowing.</p>
<p>It also proposed lowering the tax rate for average earners to 22p in the Irish pound for single people and to 14p for married couples. The average rate is around 27p at present.</p>
<p>Other points included better environmental control and a commitment for children to have a basic command of maths and science, speak Irish with confidence and be able to log onto the Internet.</p>
