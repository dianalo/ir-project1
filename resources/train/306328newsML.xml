<p>Intel Corp. on Tuesday reported that its fourth-quarter profits more than doubled, reflecting strong sales of its popular Pentium microprocessors.</p>
<p>The world's largest semiconductor maker said it earned $1.9 billion, or $2.13 a share, in the last three months of 1996, up from $867 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues rose to $6.4 billion from $4.58 billion.  </p>
<p>Wall Street analysts on average had expected the company to report fourth-quarter earnings equal to $1.84 per share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>The Santa Clara, Calif.-based semiconductor giant said it earned $5.2 billion, or $5.81 per share, in all of 1996, compared with earnings of $3.6 billion, or $4.03 a share, in 1995. Intel generated $20.8 billion in revenues last year vs. $16.2 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Intel, which issued its earnings report after markets closed, was the most actively traded stock on Nasdaq, with more than 14 million shares changing hands. It ended up 25 cents at $147.125, a 52-week high, and the company announced a two-for-one stock split along with its results.</p>
<p>The company, which provides the microprocessors used in 80 percent of the world's computers, is widely regarded as a bellwether for the personal computer group.</p>
