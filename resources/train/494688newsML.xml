<p>The dollar extended its rally on Tuesday, charging to 4-1/2 year peaks above 126 yen in Europe, and analysts said it was unlikely to pause for breath below 128 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The important levels are 128-130 yen and that is probably where they (Japanese authorities) will seek to defend it,&quot; said Sean Shepley, international economist at CS First Boston.</p>
<p>He pegged the 128/130 yen area as a key technical and psychological level that marked previous official interventions.</p>
<p>High U.S. yields, the start of Japan's 1997-98 fiscal year, and increasing odds in favour of European monetary union starting on time have all helped to fuel the dollar's rally.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency gathered fresh momentum on Tuesday as Japanese officials seemed to show little concern about a surging dollar - which has climbed nearly two percent since early April, said analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Japan (BOJ) seems to be more relaxed about the strength of the dollar and intervention -- verbal or otherwise -- is not likely until the 128/29 yen level,&quot; said a senior trader at a Belgian bank.</p>
<p>At 1113 GMT the dollar was trading at 126.27 yen, just shy of session highs at 126.52 yen -- its highest level since August 1992 -- and well up from 125.80 yen in late Europe on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no real indication that dollar/yen is suffering from fatigue, either in terms of direction or in the extent of its move,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar was trading at 1.7136 marks at midday and just off five-week highs at 1.7183 marks hit earlier, although well up from 1.7111 in late Europe on Monday.</p>
<p>Japan's Vice Trade Minister Tsutomu Makino was quoted as saying that the weak yen was more positive than negative for the country's economy at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to keep watch, but I can't say that the yen falling below 125 yen against the dollar would immediately become a problem. I think the weak yen for now is more positive (than negative) for the economy,&quot; Makino was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Japan may be savouring a weak yen as a motor for growth but economists warn of its impact on the gaping U.S. trade deficit, which swelled in February to 865.2 billion yen.</p>
<p>&quot;It might be the case that Japan can live with these levels for the yen. But the risk is that the U.S. administration or the industry could intervene,&quot; said Klaus Kusber, foreign exchange analyst at Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>&quot;The next focus is what the U.S. auto manufacturers will say as they feel the pinch of the strong dollar,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that Japan would deal appropriately with excessive movements in the foreign exchange market. Exchange rates should reflect fundamentals and stability in currency markets was desirable for the economy, he said.</p>
<p>Eisuke Sakakibara, the powerful director-general of MOF's International Finance Bureau, said authorities would be ready to intervene in foreign exchange markets if rates veered sharply from fundamentals.</p>
<p>And cabinet minister Kabun Muto urged the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to consider the possibility of raising the official discount rate (ODR), said a spokesman at the Management and Coordination Agency.</p>
<p>Analysts said Japanese outflows into higher-yielding overseas assets would only be stemmed if rates in Japan were increased, although they saw this as an unlikely scenario in the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. rates are going to be supported by strong data, and expectations of a further rate hike in the U.S. will keep differentials wide,&quot; said a trader at a Japanese bank.</p>
<p>Shepley, however, said even a nod from Japanese authorities could knock the dollar off its perch just below 4-1/2 year highs.</p>
<p>While Japanese outflows are offsetting its widening current account surplus with the United States, markets should be wary of their drying out.</p>
<p>&quot;Should Japanese investors get a nod from on high that 130 yen is a level that should not be broken, then suddenly the off switch will be turned on and the outflow of capital and dollar/yen will lose momentum of its own accord,&quot; he said.</p>
