<p>Sierra Leone, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to cut public spending, has negotiated a reduction in the amount it pays private South African security firm Executive Outcomes.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Thiamu Bangura told reporters on Thursday that the government owed the company $18.5 million in back pay for providing security and mercenaries to help the army against rebels who took up arms in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;The national economy is in bad shape. The IMF has been pressuring the government to cut the $4 million it has incurred since it took office (in March),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday the government during negotiations with the IMF and Executive Outcomes reached an agreement with the Executive Outcomes to cut down the monthly salary pay which the government pays to the Executive Outcomes from $1,225,000 to below $1 million,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He declined to disclose the new rate, but he said that Executive Outcomes had agreed to maintain the same number of men in the West African nation.</p>
<p>Diplomats say Executive Outcomes made unofficial deals with the former military government under which South African mining companies now operate inside Sierra Leone and which give Executive Outcomes good reason to remain.</p>
<p>President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and his civilian government came to power in March after multi-party elections that ended four years of army rule. Bangura said that the government had been able to pay Executive Outcomes only once since then.</p>
<p>Peace talks have stalled on the rebel demands for withdrawal of all foreign forces, including the mercenaries.</p>
