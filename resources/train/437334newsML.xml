<p>Greek banks should aim to get bigger, better capitalised, internationally oriented, offer new products and services, reduce operating costs and exploit their economies of scale, said National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou.</p>
<p>Papandoniou was speaking before the general assembly of the Hellenic Bank Association.</p>
<p>Banks should train their personnel to become more specialised in line with technological developments and new banking practices, said Papandoniou.</p>
<p>He warned bank employees against resisting changes because any delay in their introduction would work against them.</p>
<p>&quot;The government encourages mergers and acquisitions,&quot; said Papandoniou who stressed that National Bank , Commercial and Ionian Bank and Agricultural Bank formed the nucleus of the three state bank groups.</p>
<p>The national economy minister pointed out that the government welcomed the injection of fresh private capital into state banks that could also help improve their management.</p>
<p>&quot;The final goal is to cut the cost of money,&quot; said Papandoniou. &quot;...reduce the spread between lending and deposit interest rates to help Greek firms grow.&quot;</p>
<p>The independence of the central bank was among the priorities of the government as well as the strengthening of the supervising bodies of the capital market. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
