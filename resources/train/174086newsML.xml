<headline>Irish Sept credit growth 13.3 pct y/y-central bank.</headline>

<p>The adjusted annual rate of growth of Irish private-sector credit slowed to 13.3 percent in September from a revised 14.2 percent in August, central bank monthly statistics showed on Thursday.</p>
<p>The annual rate of increase in residential mortgage lending by all credit institutions rose to 16.5 percent from 16.3 percent, the bank said.</p>
<p>Non-mortgage credit rose by 14.2 percent in the year to September compared with 15.2 percent in August while the adjusted rate of broad money supply growth rose to 12.8 percent from 12.3 percent.  </p>
<p>The fall in the year-on-year rate of private sector credit growth was partly accounted for by the relatively large increase in September 1995, the central bank said.</p>
<p>But it said the adjusted rate of private sector credit growth remained high, increasing by 7.5 percent in the six months to end-September.</p>
<p>Most of the 405 million punt increase in September was Irish-pound denominated and most of it was due to mortgages, both residential and commercial.  </p>
<p>Foreign currency denominated lending increased by 209 million, almost all of which was to non-bank companies based in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC).</p>
<p>Irish pound lending rose by 196 million, mainly due to mortgage lending, the central bank said.</p>
<p>Residential mortgages rose by 163 million while other mortgage lending, mostly by building societies, increased by 49 million.</p>
<p>Excluding residential mortgage lending, Irish pound credit net of accrued interest was somewhat subdued, rising by 33 million or 0.2 percent in September, the bank said.</p>
<p>Lending to the Agricultural Intervention Agency fell by 38 million compared with a fall of 55 million in September 1995.</p>
<p>The broad monetary aggregate increased by 331 million or one percent in September and the greater part of the increase was foreign currency denominated, the bank said.</p>
<p>The Irish pound component rose by 115 million punts and the foreign currency component by 216 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the increases in both Irish pound and foreign currency components was due to rising deposit account balances, mostly term deposits,&quot; the central bank said.</p>
