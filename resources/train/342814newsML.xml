<headline>Thailand, Philippines to boost defence, trade ties.</headline>
<dateline>MANILA 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>Thailand and the Philippines agreed on Wednesday to boost defence cooperation and double two-way trade to more than $2 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and Philippine President Fidel Ramos also agreed that progress in efforts by Cambodia, Laos and Burma towards integration into the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) would hasten their entry to ASEAN.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brunei.</p>
<p>Chavalit arrived on Wednesday for a two-day visit which includes a meeting on Thursday with some of the country's top businessmen, members of the Makati Business Club.</p>
<p>Chavalit and Ramos, speaking at a news conference, said their talks focused on expanding two-way trade, with a current total volume of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed that we will try to hit as our next target double that by the year 2000, or $2 billion plus,&quot; Ramos said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Thai people always like the Number 9 figure so we propose, how about 2.9?&quot; Chavalit said.</p>
<p>Ramos said he and Chavalit agreed to bolster defence cooperation through a memorandum of understanding which officials would soon draw up.</p>
<p>They also discussed the ASEAN goal of a wider 10-nation Southeast Asian community to include Cambodia, Laos and Burma.</p>
<p>&quot;We agreed that national developments in these countries, such as progress in their efforts towards integration in the ASEAN free trade would facilitate their eventual membership in ASEAN,&quot; Ramos said.</p>
<p>AFTA members have set a timetable for eliminating tariffs within the group by 2003.</p>
<p>Chavalit's visit coincides with a controversy over a Manila Bay reclamation project which involves the Amari Coastal Bay Development Corp, in which one of Thailand's largest construction contractors, Italian Thai Development Plc, is a shareholder.</p>
<p>A senior Philippine senator has questioned the deal, saying the contract to develop the area was grossly undervalued.</p>
<p>Both Amari and Manila's Public Estates Authority, which entered into contracts with different property firms to develop the area, have denied any wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Ramos last month ordered that the contracts be reviewed.</p>
