<headline>Singapore naphtha premium soars on prompt squeeze.</headline>

<p>Naphtha premiums in Singapore have doubled in less than a month due to strong regional demand from petrochemical producers and a squeeze on supplies following the shutdown of refinery units, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>Naphtha premiums have risen to more than $1.00 per barrel from about 40 cents after unexpected prompt purchases by several companies seeking to optimise petrochemical production.</p>
<p>Traders said the outlook for naptha was bullish for another couple of months. The high premium would be supported, but it might struggle to get much higher than $1.00.  </p>
<p>The latest surge was first seen in June, when Thailand's Aromatics (Thailand) Plc stepped in to buy three or four incremental spot cargoes to cover for problems at a condensate unit, which normally provides the feedstock.</p>
<p>Thai Aromatics had to switch feedstock and use naphtha instead for the production of the aromatics, traders said.</p>
<p>Subsequently, South Korea entered the market to buy several cargoes of full-range naphtha in preparation for the start-up of a 40,000 barrel-per-day naphtha splitter.</p>
<p>The unit, owned by Samsung General Chemicals Co, is expected to start-up by the end of this month, a company official said.  </p>
<p>Incremental demand was also seen from Singapore due to the higher-than-expected operation of the new 515,000 tonne per year (tpy) ethylene plant.</p>
<p>The unit was initially expected to operate at between 70 and 80 percent of capacity due to the late start-up of a 200,000-tpy polyethylene plant, but output was raised to 100 percent due to strong demand for ethylene in the spot market.</p>
<p>The Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore, 50:50 joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and a consortium of Japanese companies led by Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd, started up the new ethylene unit at the end of April.  </p>
<p>Traders said demand was also boosted by the start up Thai Petrochemical Industry's of a 350,000 tpy ethylene plant in April.</p>
<p>The start up of these new plants has put downward pressure on ethylene prices but producers were still enjoying a good margin, ensuring output would be maintained at a high level, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Naphtha demand will be strong for another month or so because of the high prices of ethylene,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Spot ethylene prices slid by around $80 per tonne to just under $550 from a month ago but is still high enough to give producers a margin of about $200 per tonne, traders said.</p>
<p>Firmer premiums were also due to a cut in supplies from Indonesia due to the shutdown of a crude unit at the Balikpapan refinery since July 10.</p>
<p>The refinery generally exports three 240,000-barrel cargoes of naphtha a month, traders said.</p>
<p>Indonesian naphtha exports would be low in August as well because a crude unit at the Cilacap refinery will close from August 13 for about 35 days, traders said.  </p>
<p>The tighter regional supplies were also aggravated by cuts in refining output in Singapore due to poor margins and high stocks of middle distillates.</p>
<p>Currently, about 90,000-bpd of production is lost as a result of these cuts, traders said.</p>
