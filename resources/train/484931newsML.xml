<p>Jitters on the Stockholm exchange which have wiped over 110 billion crowns ($14.4 billion) off share prices this week are expected to continue for the next month or two before prices rebound, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The next two months are likely to be volatile with focus on U.S. interest rates,&quot; Mathias Wallerstrom, analyst at Nordbanken, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The bourse has plunged 5.5 percent since the Easter break, tracking a 5.3 percent fall in the U.S. Dow Jones index, following inflation worries and a 25 basis points rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve last week.</p>
<p>Although Stockholm share prices recovered a little on Thursday afternoon, with the general index edging up 0.26 percent to 2,607.41, in late trade, analysts did not see the bourse regaining the lost ground.</p>
<p>Prices had risen 16 percent in 1997 before this week's dive and analysts said a correction was in order.</p>
<p>But nobody expected to see the market tumble much further. Current conditions were sharply different from the time of the 1987 bourse collapse when Stockholm's general index plummeted 17 percent from July 1 to the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1987, inflation was high, investors had to a large extent used shares as collateral for loans, shares had a high valuation and liquidity was low,&quot; said Thomas Andersson, market analyst at Handelsbanken.</p>
<p>Currently, he said the world was entering a low inflation era and he expected inflation worries to prove unfounded. Few investors had used their shares as loan collateral, and shares were in general fairly valued and liquiditiy was high.</p>
<p>&quot;As we don't believe in an inflation bomb, we don't believe in a sharp interest rate increase so we don't believe in a bourse dive,&quot; he said. &quot;A setback in the short term will create room for an upturn with investors looking for good deals.&quot;</p>
<p>One analyst said prices could fall around ten percent before starting to pick up when bargain hunters step back in.</p>
<p>On their shopping lists, investors were expected to have growth companies, particularly telecoms shares, engineering companies and cyclicals, such as steel groups Avesta Sheffield and SSAB, mining group Trelleborg and rolling bearing group SKF.</p>
<p>Wallerstrom expected U.S. companies' first quarter earnings, which will be released shortly, and U.S. employment data, due out on Friday, to be decisive for short term moves.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a good figure, showing employment and hourly wages rose less than expected, there could be a temporary upwards correction and if the figure is bad, it could be a fall,&quot; he said,</p>
<p>&quot;Stockholm will track the U.S. completely in coming weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Andersson attributed the fact the Stockholm bourse has fallen more than Wall Street in recent days to the behaviour of the bourse's large share of foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;When the market falls two percent in the U.S., it falls three percent here as this is a smaller market with more than 30 percent foreign ownership, most of it in the U.S.,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;When the situation heats up in the U.S., investors withdraw capital from abroad, from markets such as Sweden which they might feel they don't know so well.&quot;</p>
