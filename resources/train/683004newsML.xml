<p>Jakarta stocks ended down but off lows on Tuesday on profit-taking, particularly in blue chip stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index closed down 6.25 points, or 0.87 percent, at 713.39 points after hitting an intra-day low of 711.42. Losers led gainers by 81 to 55, with 68 counters unchanged. Total turnover was estimated at 500 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market had been undergoing a technical correction after the index closed at a record high on Monday, with profit-taking particulary in medium and small-sized stocks.  </p>
<p>But in mid-afternoon, they said, there was significant selling of tobacco stocks such as Sampoerna and Gudang Garam. A broker with a Hong Kong-based firm said the selling surfaced after European investors came into the market and added blue-chips were the worst-affected.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect large selling in tobacco stocks is linked to reports in local newspapers on Gudang Garam's 1997 net target, which is lower than market expectations,&quot; said an analyst with a Singapore-based firm. She said the papers quoted company officials as saying 1997 net profit was likely to be 738 billion rupiah, compared with a market consensus of 782 billion rupiah.  </p>
<p>Brokers also said that a sell recommendation from Asia Equity brokerage firm on Sampoerna put pressure on the counter.</p>
<p>Asia Equity said it had revised down its forecast for the firm's 1997 net profit by 9.5 percent to 451 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>Sampoerna fell 3.25 percent, or 300 rupiah to 8,925 rupiah in active trading of 2.3 million shares, while Gudang Garam fell 300 rupiah, or 3.04 percent, to 9,575 rupiah on 575,500 shares.  </p>
<p>Blue chips such as toll operator Citra Marga, Indocement, Bank International Indonesia and Astra International were among the losers on profit-taking.</p>
<p>Engineering firm Bukaka Teknik Utama gained 125 rupiah in active trading with 11.5 million shares changing hands. It last traded at 1,650 rupiah on what brokers said was due to market talk of a possible higher dividend.</p>
