<p>The Indonesian rupiah was lower against the dollar in late trading on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is almost dead,&quot; one local bank dealer said, adding that many players had left for long weekend.</p>
<p>He said some late short-covering in dollars seemed to cause a small decline of the rupiah. Spot rupiah was last taken at 2,378.25 at 0800 GMT, against an opening of 2,377.0/78.0.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,377.5/78.00 and 2,371.75/72.50, respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity eased in the afternoon, with overnight money falling to 13.0 percent from 15.0/16.0 percent.  </p>
<p>The central bank offered five-day bilateral papers (SBIs) at eight percent, two-week at 10.0 percent, one and three-month at 11.25 and 12.0 percent.</p>
<p>Overnight swaps were at 4.0/4.5 and tom/next at 0.7/0.8.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market will be closed for Eid al-Fitr on February 10 and 11 and reopen on February 12, while the stock market will be closed from February 7 to 11 inclusive.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 14.25/15.00, two at 29.0/30.5, three at 39.5/40.5 and six at 78.00/80.00 points.  </p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,376/2,568 and the conversion band to 2,376/2,424 on Friday, the fourth depreciation this week.</p>
<p>The bank depreciated the rupiah by three points last week after lowering it by two points the previous week.</p>
