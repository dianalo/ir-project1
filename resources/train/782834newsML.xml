<title>UK: Dollar forges up to new highs against mark.</title>
<headline>Dollar forges up to new highs against mark.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar leapt to its highest in nearly eight years against the mark for the fourth consecutive trading day amid expectations the Bundesbank has limited scope to nudge money-market rates higher in the mark's defence.</p>
<p>Traders had speculated the Bundesbank could prepare the ground for higher money-market rates by keeping the market short of liquidity at its money-market transactions on Wednesday. Mark selling gathered pace after such talk proved to be unfounded.</p>
<p>The dollar was also boosted against the mark after a German jobless report fanned expectations that the economic recovery is too fragile to allow the Bundesbank to raise rates too far.  </p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that the Bundesbank's hands are tied,&quot; said Mark Geddes, treasury economist at ABN Amro. &quot;It has threatened higher rates and if it fails to follow through, it will be the green light for fresh gains. Dollar/mark looks like it could be trading at 1.90 next week.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar rose as high as 1.8876 marks, the strongest it has been since October 1989. It was at 1.8860/70 at 0916 GMT from 1.8788/92 late Tuesday in Europe. Dollar/yen was at 119.16/26 from 119.01/11 yesterday.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has encouraged speculation that it will engineer higher money-market rates if mark weakness persists.  </p>
<p>This has failed to deter dollar bulls, though, who expect the Bundesbank cannot raise its securities repurchase rate high enough in the face of economic fragility to stave off mark selling.</p>
<p>They got encouragement from a report today which showed the number of jobless in Germany rose by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 in July and that the unadjusted jobless rate rose to 11.4 percent from 11.0 percent in June.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank's barrels are empty in terms of what they can do to defend the currency,&quot; said Paul Lambert, senior currency strategist at UBS Ltd in London.  </p>
<p>&quot;The trend is very much consistent with the economic fundamentals, as the jobless numbers showed, and if they try to raise rates it will be negative for the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>With the earliest likely opportunity for the Bundesbank to switch to variable-rate repos now next week, traders are gunning for a move above 1.90 marks in the coming days.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is taking over from sterling as the world's favourite investment,&quot; said Brian Martin, chief economist, fx at BZW in London.</p>
<p>While dollar/yen has lagged the U.S. currency's gains against the mark, it climbed to a 12-week high overnight.  </p>
<p>Expectations that Japanese interest rates will stay at record lows were reinforced after Japanese Vice Finance Minister Takeshi Komura said overnight that the low interest-rate policy the Bank of Japan was following still had positive economic effects.</p>
<p>His comments overshadowed remarks made by a U.S. embassy official in Tokyo about the potential for trade friction between the U.S. and Japan and buoyed dollar/yen.</p>
<p>Lawrence Greenwood, the economic minister-counsellor at the U.S. embassy said that the increases in Japan's current account could trigger trade tensions between the two countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan's stance on monetary policy will remain accommodative,&quot; said Nick Stamencovic, economist at DKB International. &quot;Dollar/yen has the momentum to go to 120 though the market will be concerned about intervention at that level.&quot;</p>
