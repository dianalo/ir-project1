<title>UK: SOCCER-BARNES ALLOWED FREE TRANSFER FROM LIVERPOOL.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-BARNES ALLOWED FREE TRANSFER FROM LIVERPOOL.</headline>
<dateline>LIVERPOOL, England 1997-08-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former England midfielder John Barnes has been told he can leave Liverpool on a free transfer after 10 years at the club.</p>
<p>Barnes, 33, asked for the free transfer after spending Liverpool's first match of the season, a 1-1 draw with Wimbledon on Saturday, on the subs bench.</p>
<p>He is believed to feel the arrival of three new midfield players - Paul Ince, Oyvind Leonhardsen and Danny Murphy - left him with a doubtful future as a starter on the team.</p>
<p>&quot;We made it quite clear to John that we feel he has been an excellent servant to club and can stay if he wants, but that if he feels it is beneficial to him, he can go on free transfer,&quot; a club spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Asked about Barnes's feelings regarding his future with Liverpool, the spokesman added: &quot;You have only to look at the midfield that played on Saturday. He was on the bench but did not play.&quot;</p>
<p>The winger-turned-central midfielder joined Liverpool in 1987 for 900,000 pounds ($1.4 million) where he won two Championships, an F.A. Cup and League Cup medal in 10 distinguished years on Merseyside.</p>
