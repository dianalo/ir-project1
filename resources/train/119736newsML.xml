<p>The sugar freight market was awash with new and fixed business on Wednesday, with yet another route quoted for the first time ever, shipbrokers said.</p>
<p>CSR scored yet another first with an order for Iran.</p>
<p>The Australian shipper was seeking tonnage for 30,500 tonnes of bulk sugar from Queensland to Iran for prompt to early November dates. Shipbrokers said they believed this was the first such freight order ever issued.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, CSR quoted for 15,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Queensland to Jeddah for 10/20 November -- another first.</p>
<p>South Africa Sugar Association (SASA) was believed to have fixed 18,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Durban to the U.S. and was also open for 20,000 tonnes from the same origin to Singapore for 25 October/5 November.</p>
<p>E D &amp; F Man also featured heavily on the market on Wednesday, quoting for 14/15,000 tonnes from Maceio/Recife to Algeria with Black Sea option for the end of October.</p>
<p>Shipbrokers said Man was also open for 12/14,000 tonnes in bags from east coast Mexico to Colombo for 1/10 November. The order probably had other options but details were sketchy.</p>
<p>Man was said to have fixed 20/25,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Paranagua to Morocco/Egyptian Mediterranean/Black Sea for the end of October. Details of the rate have yet to emerge.</p>
<p>Other fixtures included Mauritius Sugar Syndicate, which was said to be firm with its earlier bulk order for 14,000 tonnes from Port Louis to London for end-October/early-November.</p>
<p>Shipbrokers said the rate achieved was stg 13.75, the same as the previous fixture.</p>
<p>Glencore quoted for 13,500 tonnes of bagged sugar from Santos/Paranagua to Egypt, Dar es Salaam or Mombasa for prompt.</p>
<p>Louis Dreyfus was open with two combinable orders for the end of October from Antwerp to Turkish Mediterranean with Sea of Marmara option in bagged 8,900 and 3,000 tonnages.</p>
<p>Lastly, Cargill quoted for 25,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Santos to the Egyptian Mediterranean, Black Sea or Dubai, with grabs, for the end of October.</p>
