<p>South Africa hosted Hollywood heavy-hitters in November in a bid to sell its film and TV talent, but the local industry has a long and arduous road to stardom.</p>
<p>Warner Bros, MGM and 20th Century Fox were among the studios represented at the inaugural five-day Southern African Film and Television Market in Cape Town which closed on November 17.</p>
<p>The market included about 120 meetings with foreign distributors and broadcasters at which local makers of documentaries and feature films pitched their ideas in the hopes of signing co-production deals.</p>
<p>But participants said South African broadcasters and private investors had to make a far bigger commitment to the local industry before it could hope to take off in the same way that movie-making had elsewhere, for example in Australia.</p>
<p>South African Arts and Culture Minister Lionel Mtshali announced during the market that the government would make 10 million rand ($2.1 million) available to stimulate the industry, but few in the business thought this was enough.</p>
<p>&quot;The difference between here and Australia is that in Australia the state took full responsibility to make a film industry happen,&quot; said leading South African director Elaine Proctor.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure this government is able to do that, given what else it's got to contend with...It's all going to be determined by how much South Africa's vast resources in the private sector get connected with the process of making movies,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;South African investors have to take a risk...At the moment it's not attractive, you don't get any tax breaks and it's far riskier than investing on the stock exchange.&quot;</p>
<p>Mtshali said a foundation would be set up to develop South Africa's film industry and that it would study, among other things, the introduction of incentives for private enterprise.</p>
<p>His deputy minister, Brigitte Mabandla, said the government was aware of the contribution the movie industry could make to job creation and economic development.</p>
<p>Television producer Carl Fischer said that in terms of the international industry, South Africa was &quot;more than just flavour of the month&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's seen as an emerging market in the film and television world. International media players are looking at it seriously. But we have to get our own local financing together in order to take advantage of that.&quot;</p>
<p>Fischer said the South African market was too small to attract private financing.</p>
<p>&quot;One cannot finance a film from commercial money and expect to get the money back. You have to have some kind of deficit financing or pre-sale or distribution guarantee from overseas to attract that local rand...</p>
<p>&quot;If we get our industry together in terms of a policy framework that can encourage South African production, then in years to come this will become a significant market on the world production and distribution map,&quot; Fischer said.</p>
<p>Michael Jenkinson, vice-president of acquisitions for 20th Century Fox, told delegates to the market that South Africa had great potential as a new source of film ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;We're actively looking for product,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there's a great opportunity here -- there's interesting cultures, a rich history, a lot of diversity, it's English language for the most part...There's a lot of curiosity about this marketplace and to see what direction it's going to take.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously there's an infrastructure and a film-making history and tradition. We'd love to see this market be another Australia, a place where we've managed to get a lot of product recently,&quot; Jenkinson said.</p>
<p>Steve Markovitz, one of the coordinators of the Cape Town market which is due to become an annual event, said many of the foreign executives had made the point that South Africa itself had to take the lead in developing a healthy film industry.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't provide the whole budget for a feature,&quot; he said. &quot;We need more confidence from local investors, we need to bring something to the deal ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Markovitz said it was essential that the state broadcaster gave more of an impetus to the industry, by for example buying television rights to a project in advance to help to attract financing.</p>
<p>The most successful South African-made film was &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, a 1980s comedy by Jamie Uys about the adventures of a Bushman. Relatively big-grossing films on apartheid themes such as &quot;Cry, Freedom&quot; were made outside the country with foreign money.</p>
