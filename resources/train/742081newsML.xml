<p>Billy Ray Brown, playing with &quot;a sense of urgency&quot; after losing his PGA Tour privileges last year, shot a 5-under-par 67 Sunday to win the $1 million Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic.</p>
<p>A birdie on the par-5, 532-yard 18th hole enabled Brown to edge his former University of Houston teammate, Mike Standly, by one stroke.</p>
<p>&quot;I answered a lot of questions about myself with my performance out there today,&quot; said Brown, who had to go back to the PGA Tour qualifying school last fall to regain his tour exemption. &quot;I can't tell you how much this means to me. I promise you that right now I'm as happy about winning here as Justin Leonard is about winning the British Open.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a sense of urgency.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown had a four-round total of 17-under 271 on the Jack Nicklaus-designed Annandale Golf Club course. The victory was his first since the 1992 Byron Nelson Classic and, after earning only $39,000 this year, Brown picked up $180,000. He also earned a two-year PGA Tour exemption.</p>
<p>&quot;This is by far the biggest win of my career,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I don't mean to make light of the others, but this one, because of the circumstances, means the most to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Standly put up a strong challenge with a final-round 66, leaving him at 272. Mike Brisky had a 68 to finish third at 273, while third-round leader Steve Jurgensen faded to a 72, dropping him into a six-way tie for fourth at 274.</p>
