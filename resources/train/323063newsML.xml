<p>Singapore shares ended sharply lower on Tuesday as local dealers took heavy profits from Monday's price rises.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a roller-coaster,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;Up 27 points yesterday, down almost as much today. I think it will steady.&quot;</p>
<p>The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) ended 21.09 points lower at 2,250.79 with 306.1 million shares traded. Losers led gainers by 279 to 140.</p>
<p>The fall disappointed some dealers, who had been predicting a strong uptrend after Monday's close, which was the STII's highest point since July 4, 1995.</p>
<p>Dealers said there had been overseas money coming into the market all day shown by the very high volume, but they said this buying was balanced by widespread local selling.</p>
<p>The biggest losers of the day were all blue chips: two banks, UOB foreign and OCBC foreign, car retailer Cycle &amp; Carriage and maritime-based conglomerate Keppel Corp. Most shed the bulk of Monday's gains.</p>
<p>The most active stocks were multimedia company Aztech Systems and computer maker IPC Corp Ltd, which dealers said benefited from a positive revaluation of the electronics sector.</p>
