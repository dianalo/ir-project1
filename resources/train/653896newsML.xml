<headline>US lawmaker offers bill to block EPA air standards.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Republican House member Wednesday introduced a bill to block the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing new air-quality standards.</p>
<p>Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio offered a bill that would bar the EPA from imposing new standards until communities comply with current air quality standards.</p>
<p>The bill has 23 or 24 sponsors, including one Democrat, James Traficant of Ohio, a spokesman for Ney said.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration still is debating whether to finalize the EPA's proposal for stricter standards against soot and smog, or approve different standards.  </p>
<p>A decision was expected within the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;The EPA's irrational air-regulation proposals will cost working people their jobs, force local governments to implement punitive pollution-control measures and increase costs on fuel and consumer goods -- without being based on sound science,&quot; Ney said in a statement.</p>
<p>EPA Administrator Carol Browner has said current standards do not adequately protect public health and that the EPA proposal was based on numerous studies that have been reviewed by other scientists.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review its standards for major air pollutants every five years and set the standards to provide a margin of safety for public health.</p>
