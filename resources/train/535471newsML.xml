<p>Asian crude prices were steady on Thursday but differentials continued to fall in the face of weak demand.</p>
<p>Oman was heard traded as low as MPM -20 cents between a Japanese trader and a Thai refiner. The deal was nearly matched by another at MPM -19 cents between a South Korean refiner and a Japanese trader.</p>
<p>Both deals lowered the price on Oman deals on the basis of MPM related pricing, but did not match the Dubai +75 cents deal earlier in the week between a western trader and a Japanese trader.  </p>
<p>The Dubai deal implied MPM -25 cents, based on a Dubai/Oman differential of $1.00. However, the Dubai-related deal was for just 100,000 barrels which traders said was not representative of the market.</p>
<p>There was a flurry of Dubai wet deals in a range of June quotes less six to 10 cents.</p>
<p>Traders said these were possibly sparked by worries that India would continue not to take Dubai crude in its monthly tenders.</p>
<p>Its June tender closes later on Thursday and offers are valid until late Friday.  </p>
<p>Dubai was not awarded in May because of much more competitive quotes on Suez Blend and India only took two Dubai cargoes in April. On both occasions the India tender result sparked a fall in Dubai values.</p>
<p>ADNOC grades remained quietly discussed, with Lower Zakum and Umm Shaif said bid at ADNOC -10 cents.</p>
<p>Petron closed a tender to buy June-loading Qatar Marine.</p>
