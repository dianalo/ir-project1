<headline>India sees stable rupee despite government crisis.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>India's Commerce Minister Bolla Buli Ramaiah said on Monday that the rupee will stabilise despite the political crisis gripping the government.</p>
<p>&quot;It will all stabilise because we have a substantial amount of foreign exchange reserves. Today we have more than $22 billion of reserves,&quot; Ramaiah told Reuters when asked if the rupee was likely to be affected by the crisis triggered by the Congress party's withdrawal of support to Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's government.  </p>
<p>The Congress party on Sunday withdrew vital support for the ten-month-old minority United Front ruling coalition and said it would attempt to form a new government.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India said last Saturday that the country's foreign exchange reserves had risen to $25.14 billion on March 21, 1997 from $24.66 billion the previous week.</p>
<p>The Indian rupee held steady against the dollar on Monday after a brief shiver as political uncertainty engulfed the country, dealers in Bombay said.</p>
<p>The rupee lost 10 paise from last week's close to 35.99 per dollar in intial trading but recovered as panic that the country would face another period of political drift abated. By noon the rupee had bounced back to 35.91/92, little changed from opening quotes of 35.91/93 and only slightly down from Thursday's pre-Easter weekend close of 35.89/90, dealers said.</p>
