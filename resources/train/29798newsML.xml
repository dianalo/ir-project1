<p>MGE spring wheat futures ended lower after trading mixed most of the day in light volume, traders said.</p>
<p>Scale-down mill buying was noted but light hedge selling limited gains, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a little bit of hedge selling today but much less than Friday,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I don't think there was a heck of a lot of grain that moved over the weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>Wheat tried to rally at midday as CBOT wheat jumped but &quot;we don't have anyone who wants to pay up on the rallies,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders noted September spring wheat futures were trading at a six-cent premium to Chicago wheat on the close. The spread had been 11-1/4 cents on the opening.</p>
<p>Barley set contract lows for the December and March contracts, but volume was estimated at two lots, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing some good selling of barley,&quot; one trader said, referring to farmer selling in the cash market. &quot;We got (futures) down fairly close to cash prices before we finally saw some buy paper come into the pit.&quot;</p>
<p>Barley ended down 11 to 13 cents per cwt with September untraded at $7.40 per cwt.</p>
<p>Wheat ended 1/2 to five cents per bushel lower with September down 1-1/4 at $4.58-1/2.</p>
