<p>The Argentine political panorama has changed completely with the weekend birth of an alliance that poses a serious threat to ruling Peronists in October's mid-term polls and 1999's presidential elections.</p>
<p>For the first time, political analysts say, the Peronist Party is no longer guaranteed a majority in the lower house of Congress and there is a serious chance President Carlos Menem's successor in 1999 will not be a Peronist.</p>
<p>&quot;It's too early to do the numbers but two things are sure: the political scene has changed and the government is worried, however much they say they aren't,&quot; political analyst and pollster Ricardo Rouvier told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the most important Argentine political event of the decade,&quot; crowed Radical leader Rodolfo Terragno after his century-old party and the fledgling Frepaso coalition ended nearly a year's shilly-shallying on Saturday to announce the centre-left &quot;Alliance for Work, Justice and Education.&quot;</p>
<p>For Raul Alfonsin, the Radical ex-president who sacrificed his bid for a seat in Congress for the alliance's sake, the aim is &quot;to build a power-base that will not only give us victory in October's election but the government in 1999.&quot;</p>
<p>Until this weekend, the only interest in October's vote, when half the seats in the lower house are up for grabs, was to see what majority the Peronists kept and how Menem's heir apparent Gov. Eduardo Duhalde staked his claim on 1999.</p>
<p>Menem, re-elected in 1995 on 50 percent of the vote, was confident of reaping the rewards of giving Argentina stability and a zero-inflation economy since he came to power in 1989.</p>
<p>The Radicals, who governed from 1983-89, had fallen into disarray and third place in 1995. The Frepaso had taken the lead in attacking Menem's weakest flanks -- corruption and unemployment -- but lacked grass-roots infrastructure.</p>
<p>Alone, neither was in a position to take advantage of the growing disenchantment with Menem and often violent protest at the side-effects of his free-market economic reforms.</p>
<p>Now the Peronists' worst electoral nightmare has come true -- the Frepaso's gumption and charismatic leaders teaming up with the Radicals' well-established party infrastructure.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now people thought 'I don't like the Peronists but at least they know how to run the country.' Now there's a team that can win and can govern too,&quot; said analyst James Neilson.</p>
<p>Menem tried to disqualify the alliance by comparing it with the &quot;sinister&quot; forces that opposed party founder Juan Peron in 1946 and ousted him in a coup a decade later.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, once again, we have to choose: between the Argentina of Peron, or the Argentina of darkness, the Argentina of the past or of permanent crisis,&quot; Menem told supporters.</p>
<p>His tough Interior Minister Carlos Corach described the alliance Monday as &quot;an obvious electoral manoeuvre...faced with the possibility of both parties being beaten by Peronism.&quot;</p>
<p>Frepaso Sen. Graciela Fernandez Meijide chided Menem for the historical comparison, saying it &quot;shows he doesn't understand that alternating power is the basis of democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Meijide is fighting October's toughest battle by taking on Peronism's new spiritual flag-bearer, Duhalde's wife Hilda, in the Peronist stronghold of Buenos Aires Province. Meijde is favourite to challenge Duhalde in 1999 if she wins in October.</p>
<p>In the key Buenos Aires Province, a Peronist stronghold which is home to 40 percent of Argentine voters, polls show Peronism winning 31-35 percent in October, Frepaso second at 28-29 percent and the Radicals third at 16-18 percent.</p>
<p>In the capital, Frepaso comes first with 28-30 percent, the Radicals are second with 21 percent and Peronism trails fourth behind indepenent candidates with just 11 percent.</p>
