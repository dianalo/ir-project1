<p>Japan has offered to host peace talks between the warring sides in Afghanistan, a government spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The offer was made during a debate in the U.N. Security Council late on Wednesday on Afghanistan but there were no immediate signs either side in the conflict would accept.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a need for a neutral venue for peace talks, we would not hesitate to make as much of a contribution as we can, including Japan playing host,&quot; deputy chief Cabinet Secretary Teijiro Furukawa told a press briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan is trusted by each faction to a certain degree. Therefore we hope that they will sit at the negotiating table,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The purist Islamic Taleban controls some three-quarters of Afghanistan and has ousted the administration of President Burhanuddin Rabbani from the capital, Kabul.</p>
<p>But forces of the ousted government have been fighting back. Rabbani's military chief, Ahmad Shah Masood, told the new powers in Kabul to pull all their fighters out of the capital or face the consequences. His forces have ousted the Islamic fighters from two towns north of Kabul in recent days.</p>
<p>The ousted government's deputy foreign minister Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai on Wednesday urged the Taleban to evacuate Kabul and proposed an international police force to ensure security prior to negotiations on an interim government of national unity.</p>
