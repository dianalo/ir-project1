<p>Malaysian rubber prices were barely changed at the close as both buyers and sellers were unwilling to commit themselves at current levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market was also trying to shake off the effects of the long holiday weekend. The local rubber market was closed on Monday for a Hindu festival.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no bids at all today while offer prices were maintained,&quot; a local dealer said. &quot;Market players are playing a waiting game.&quot;</p>
<p>He said while buyers stayed at the sidelines, producers were also not keen to sell due to rains in some crop areas.  </p>
<p>At the close, December RSS1 buyer was quoted at 320.50 cents ($1.27) a kg by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board, down half cent from Friday. December SMR 20 buyer was unchanged at 310.50 cents ($1.23) a kg.</p>
<p>Traders retained previous offer prices, quoting the SMR CV at 366 cents, SMR L at 344, SMR 5 at 322, SMR 10 at 311, SMR 20 at 310 and drum latex at 237.</p>
<p>The INRO five-day moving average was 245.49 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Nov 11 against 245.37 on Nov 8. The daily indicator price was 245.65 versus 246.17.</p>
