<p>The Czech PX50 index closed three points lower to 504.7 on Thursday despite a late rally during continuous trading which pulled the RPIX index two points higher to close at 1,026.</p>
<p>SPT Telecom recovered from heavy early losses closing six crowns lower at 2,879. The company posted its nine month 1996 financial results on Thursday afternoon showing gross profits of 6.0 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The figures were broadly in line with predictions and analysts anticipated little effect on SPT's share price.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth,&quot; said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance.</p>
<p>Some other major issues performed substantially better than in most of the rest of the week. CEZ gained 10 crowns to 960 and Ceska Sporitelna rose 15 crowns to 345.</p>
<p>However, Komercni Banka continued to slide sharply ahead of Friday's scheduled released of nine month financial results. Komercni declined 39 crowns to 2,000.</p>
<p>Most issues in the broader market capped a bad week with further falls. The biggest points decliner was conference organiser BVV Brno which lost 131 crowns to 3,169.</p>
