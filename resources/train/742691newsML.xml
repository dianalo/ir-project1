<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks extend slide on Telmex, trade thin.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks extend slide on Telmex, trade thin.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks sharply extended early falls at mid-morning Monday as profit-taking on market heavyweight Telmex weighed on a thin-volume market.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically it's down on Telmex, which is dragging down the market amid thin volume. Investors are still scared after last week's volatility,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index was down 58.78 points, or 1.25 percent, at 4,661.78. Volume was &quot;dead slow&quot; at 9.8 million shares, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Telfonos de Mxico (Telmex) was meanwhile down 36 centavos at 19.54 pesos and accounted for about one-third of all shares traded mid-morning. The telecom's ADRs had meanwhile shed 11/16 to trade at 49-5/8.</p>
<p>Dealers said an uncertain trend on Wall Street was hurting ADR prices more than stock markets in Brazil, which considerably rattled Mexican equities last week.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was down 6.73 points at 7,883.73 points after zigzagging through the morning. The Bovespa index of most active stocks in Sao Paulo had meanwhile recouped 0.48 percent at 11,235 points.  </p>
<p>Dealers said financial firm Bancomer, one of Mexico's biggest, also weighed heavily on the bourse as it had lagged last week's slide. Bancomer was off 12 centavos at 4.38 pesos.</p>
<p>On the broad market, sliders far outstripped gainers by 38 to seven, out of a total of 62 stocks changing hands.</p>
