<p>U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid was officially relieved from duty on Thursday after a record-breaking extended stay aboard Russia's Mir space station finally ended with the arrival of the shuttle Atlantis.</p>
<p>Lucid's place on the orbiting outpost was taken by John Blaha, a 54-year-old former Vietnam fighter pilot with four previous shuttle flights to his name.</p>
<p>&quot;It's good to be back,&quot; said Lucid as she began to pack her gear aboard Atlantis. &quot;We're having a good time.&quot;</p>
<p>Atlantis arrived at Mir late on Wednesday and the hatches between the two craft swung open at 12:40 a.m. CDT (0540 GMT) as they soared 248 miles (400 km) above the South Pacfic.</p>
<p>Atlantis skipper Bill Readdy was welcomed to the orbiting outpost with a handshake and hug from his Russian counterpart, Valery Korzun.</p>
<p>But the warmest greeting came when Lucid was reunited with Blaha. The two U.S. astronauts, who have flown together in space twice before, floated in each other's arms, wearing wide grins.</p>
<p>Lucid was seen chatting and laughing with her U.S. colleagues, but it was some hours before she was heard at mission control over NASA's radio channels.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing anybody could have said that would have described it any better than seeing her pensively waiting in the docking module for the hatch to open,&quot; said astronaut Frank Culberston who heads NASA's shuttle-Mir programme and watched the docking from mission control.</p>
<p>&quot;Her mission was complete and all she needed was a pick up,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought it said a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>Atlantis, with six astronauts and thousands of pounds (kilos) of supplies aboard, arrived at Mir at 10:13 p.m. CDT on Wednesday (0313 GMT on Thursday).</p>
<p>&quot;Atlantis and Mir are shaking hands,&quot; Readdy said as the metallic petals of the two docking ports slipped together.</p>
<p>The shuttle's arrival at Mir, its fourth visit, ended a three-day chase through space that began early on Monday with a pre-dawn blastoff from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre.</p>
<p>Lucid has been waiting for her ride home since early August. The shuttle was running nearly seven weeks late because of rocket problems, a threatening hurricane and scheduling difficulties.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old mother-of-three has been working aboard the Russian space outpost since March as part of a NASA effort to learn more about long duration space flights before the construction of an international space station begins.</p>
<p>Atlantis will be berthed at Mir for five days while supplies and equipment are transferred to and from the station. The shuttle is carrying about 4,600 pounds (2,070 kgs) of supplies and equipment for Mir and will return to Earth with 2,200 pounds (990 kgs) of scientific samples and other gear from the station.</p>
<p>The shuttle is due back to earth on Sept. 26, ending Lucid's 188-day mission, a record for a woman and the longest by an American.</p>
