<title>PHILIPPINES: FORECAST - SM Prime profit seen growing.</title>
<headline>FORECAST - SM Prime profit seen growing.</headline>
<dateline>MANILA 1997-01-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>SM Prime Holdings Inc, the biggest shopping mall operator in the Philippines, is expected to record a steady growth in profits last year and in 1997 on the back of increased consumer spending, analysts said.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of six securities firms completed this week showed that SM Prime's net income in 1996 was estimated at an average 1.914 billion pesos, up 26.8 percent from 1.510 billion pesos in 1995.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1996, SM Prime's net income rose by 30.7 percent to 1.334 billion from 1.021 billion pesos the previous year. The company is likely to announce full-year results later this month or in early February.</p>
<p>The poll also showed an average forecast of 2.404 billion pesos in net income for 1997, up 25.6 percent from the 1996 estimate.</p>
<p>Analysts said SM Prime represents the best play in the retail trade sector in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail trade is expected to improve by at least 15 percent per year, with an anticipated growth in consumption expenditure, which accounts for 77 percent of Gross National Product,&quot; a report by All Asia Securities said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Demand for retail space continues to be strong. Based on SM Prime's remaining 20 spaces at the South Mall (shopping centre in Manila), there are at least 1,500 applicants,&quot; said Fred de Vera, an analyst with ING Baring Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;They (SM Prime) have the luxury of time to choose the right tenant mix.&quot;</p>
<p>SM Prime has said it will open at least two malls every year from 1997 until 2000, which would ensure its dominance in the retail trade sector and stave off competition. A law is expected to be passed this year to open up retail trade to foreigners.</p>
<p>The opening up of the retail sector may even benefit SM Prime since foreign chains cannot own the land on which they develop malls, analysts said.</p>
<p>This year, SM Prime is expected to open two malls in Fairview and Cavite, located north and south of Manila respectively.</p>
<p>Analysts following the company said the expansion would double SM Prime's total gross floor area by the end of the century from the current area of just over one million square metres.</p>
<p>SM Prime currently has five malls, four of which are located in metropolitan Manila and one in Cebu, central Philippines.  </p>
<p>SM Prime is well-positioned to undertake an aggressive expansion programme with an estimated 11 billion pesos in net cash at the end of 1996, ING Barings' De Vera said.</p>
<p>One new mall is estimated to cost over one billion pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;The cash-rich nature of its business is quite attractive,&quot; said Raphael Manalaysay, director of research of Socgen-Crosby UBP Securities Inc.</p>
