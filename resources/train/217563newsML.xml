<p>Startling images from the Hubble Space Telescope of &quot;comet-clouds&quot; in a rare cartwheel-shaped galaxy could shed light on gyrations that may lie ahead for our own Milky Way, scientists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The comet-clouds are not really comets but have the distinctive streaming tails that comets possess, and are evidence of a massive galactic collision 200 million years ago, scientists at the Space Telescope Science Institute reported in a statement accompanying the pictures.</p>
<p>The images, made two years ago by the orbiting Hubble but released now after thorough analysis, show a starry wagon-wheel with wispy, almost invisible spokes and a dense, swirling, gaseous hub.</p>
<p>At the edge of the hub, or nucleus, white-headed comet-clouds appear to be chasing each other at speeds up to 700,000 miles (1.127 million km) an hour.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a real rarity, an eye-grabber,&quot; Curt Struck, who analysed the images, said by telephone from Iowa State University, referring to the galaxy's distinctive shape, which has prompted astronomers to call it the Cartwheel Galaxy.</p>
<p>&quot;Rings like that (the wheel's outer starry rim) are only produced when galaxies collide nearly head-on,&quot; Struck said. The wheel's evanescent spokes are further signs of such a cosmic smash-up.</p>
<p>Astronomers believe the Cartwheel collided with a smaller galaxy but that the two did not merge.</p>
<p>Struck said the smaller galaxy wound up about 100,000 light-years away -- a mere stone's throw in the cosmic context but vast by Earth standards.</p>
<p>A light-year is about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion km), the distance light travels in a year. The Cartwheel is 500 million light-years from Earth.</p>
<p>Another unique feature of the Cartwheel is the near-absence of young stars or star-forming regions in its interior, Struck said. The stars are almost exclusively located in the galaxy's circular perimeter.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Milky Way Galaxy, where Earth is located, has numerous areas where stars are born, and stars stud its entire two-armed swirling form.</p>
<p>The study of the Cartwheel is important, Struck said, because galactic evolution is generally caused by collisions: &quot;When they're messed up a little by a collision, things are pushed along.&quot;</p>
<p>The collision appears to have formed the comet-clouds as well as the sparkling wheel, he said.</p>
<p>In the Milky Way, Struck believes that the Great Magellanic Clouds, visible in the southern sky, are evidence of a collision with a smaller galaxy, and future collisions are likely.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a group of galaxies and probably in the future we will interact with them,&quot; he said. &quot;It's probably part of the story of our Milky Way.&quot;</p>
