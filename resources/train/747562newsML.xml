<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks end up, discount poor finance results.</title>
<headline>Thai stocks end up, discount poor finance results.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-07-22</dateline>

<p>Retail buying of finance stocks and foreign investors reluctance to sell ahead of any possible IMF bailout helped Thai stocks post modest gains by the close on Tuesday despite poor half year earnings results, traders said.</p>
<p>The SET Index pared earlier losses to end 6.41 points or 0.98 percent higher at 659.78. The SET 50 added 0.59 points or 1.19 percent to 49.97 in trade worth 5.47 billion baht.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are still being very selective but the local punters are trying to drag it out in the finance sector even though the fundamentals don't really support it,&quot; said a trader at Phatra Thanakit.  </p>
<p>Half year results from commercial banks and finance and securities firms were sharply down almost across the board but foreign investors were reluctant to sell on the figures ahead of a possible IMF package which could spike prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that Thailand might seek an IMF package to put its economy on an even keel although the authorities have discounted the idea so far.</p>
<p>The downside was limited as most investors had been bracing for a poor set of results, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Though the results exceeded most scenarios I think expectations were pretty low anyway,&quot; said a foreign analyst.  </p>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank Plc gained four baht to 118, Siam Commercial Bank Plc added seven to 130 and Dhana Siam Plc ended up 2.75 to 42.75.</p>
<p>The finance sector's 3.46 percent gain was sentiment driven by local retailers who were playing low-priced stocks on sentiment against prevailing fundamentals, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some local investors think they can push these shares under 10 baht to 20 or 30 and think these stocks have a lot of room to go even though the fundamentals don't support it at all,&quot; said the trader.</p>
