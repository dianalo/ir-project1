<p>Buying by a handful of large domestic players boosted Belgian linear bonds to outperform their neighbours on Tuesday, but traders said the outlook remained uncertain in a still thin New Year market.</p>
<p>Traders said one of the reasons for the rally was the switch to the March 2007 OLO as the new benchmark while most attention remained on the former benchmark, the May 2006 bond.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very strong. It is amazing. One reason is the change in the benchmark,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said there was also a lack of players in the market, meaning that any buying tended to have an exagerated effect.  </p>
<p>&quot;The main problem for us now is the new issue in Germany. It needs more buying so that the spread can come back out to more normal levels,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The spread of the 2006 OLO over equivalent Bunds dropped at one stage during the day to around five basis points -- half what traders said they would feel more comfortable with.</p>
<p>The sudden surge on Tuesday took most traders by surprise. They had been expecting a rangebound Belgian market at least until German and U.S. data that are due on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>On Thursday the German Bundesbank meets for the first time this year and unemployment figures are due.</p>
<p>On Friday the United States produces its December non-farm payroll figures -- always a nail-biting moment of the bond markets.</p>
<p>The yield of the new benchmark 2007 OLO ended Tuesday at 6.14 percent against Monday's closing 6.18 percent, while the spread over Bunds narrowed to 18 basis points from 22.</p>
<p>The March futures contract was 28 basis points up at 119.13, having moved in a 119.27/118.57 range.</p>
