<p>French farmers angered by falling beef prices led a herd of cows through Paris towards the Eiffel Tower on Friday and sent a delegation to see President Jacques Chirac at the Elysee palace.</p>
<p>The herdsmen were slowly wending their way into central Paris, their cows in tow, to drive home their message of discontent over the state of the beef market since this year's disclosure that mad cow disease appeared to be a risk to human health.</p>
<p>They began their protest three weeks ago in the central town of Charroux, and their slow march across the country has been steadily picking up steam.</p>
<p>Chirac, who started out as an agriculture minister defending farmers' interests in the European Union, has agreed to meet them to discuss their concerns.</p>
<p>While the delegation of five prepared to meet Chirac, the main group of protesters was headed through the streets of the capital towards the Eiffel Tower from suburban Versailles, where they had spent the night.</p>
<p>On Thursday, thousands of farmers blockaded roads across the country in a protest aimed at barring imports of beef from outside the European Union.</p>
<p>Farmers had threatened an &quot;incendiary&quot; end to the summer holidays and the blockade was the first in a wave of social unrest expected to target the austerity-minded centre-right government in coming weeks.</p>
<p>The FNSEA farmers' union, which mobilised demonstrators by mobile phone and fax in secrecy, said about 15,000 farmers erected blockades on main roads and at motorway toll gates in many areas to carry out spot checks on lorries.</p>
<p>The main quarry was trucks carrying imports from Britain or from outside the EU -- especially cheap imports from eastern Europe, which breeders say have helped force beef prices down by a third in recent months after the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>The unions demanded the suspension of imports of live animals and beef from third countries.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur has asked EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler for new measures to ensure that imports of non-EU cows for fattening within the 15-nation bloc and of non-EU beef did not harm the EU market.</p>
<p>But while Vasseur acknowledged the breeders' &quot;distress and disarray&quot;, a ministry official said that France did not favour banning non-EU beef.</p>
