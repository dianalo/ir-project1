<p>A new art gallery which will provide a home for the largest collection of the works of sculptor Jacob Epstein in Europe is to be built in the English town of Walsall.</p>
<p>Council leaders on Thursday announced they are to get 16 million pounds ($25.40 million) from the profits of Britain's National Lottery to fund the gallery, which they say will make the town a magnet for art buffs.</p>
<p>The building, which should open in 1999, will be home to the Garman Ryan art collection, which was built up by Epstein's wife Kathleen Garman and her lifelong friend, American sculptor Sally Ryan.</p>
<p>It includes works by Constable, Manet, Matisse, Monet, Modigliani, Picasso and Turner as well as many of the abstract sculptures of the New York-born Epstein.</p>
<p>Garman presented the collection to Walsall in the 1970s, more than a decade after her husband's death.</p>
<p>The European Union has already provided most of the rest of the cost of the 21 million pound ($33.34 million) project. ($1=.6299 Pound)</p>
