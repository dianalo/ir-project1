<headline>China reports arrests after blasts in restive west.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1997-02-28</dateline>

<p>Police in China's mainly Moslem city of Urumqi have reported several arrests following a string of bomb blasts this week that killed at least four people and injured more than 60, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made several arrests,&quot; an official of the public security bureau in Urumqi, capital of the western region of Xinjiang, said by telephone.  </p>
<p>&quot;All we can say is that we have people who were responsible for the explosions,&quot; one police official said.</p>
<p>He declined to say how many people had been arrested or whether they were ethnic Han Chinese or from China's mainly Moslem Uighur minority, who make up the majority of the population in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Three bombs planted on buses blew up within minutes of each other on Tuesday in an apparently coordinated attack that coincided with final memorial rites for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in far-off Beijing.</p>
