<title>THAILAND: Thai rice steady, trade hopes for Philippine deal.</title>
<headline>Thai rice steady, trade hopes for Philippine deal.</headline>

<p>Thai rice prices were quietly steady this week with the market hopeful that Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchayudh's visit to Manila next week could seal a rice sale to the Philippines, trade sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Apart from recent buying from Malaysia and modest orders from regular customers, there were no new leads in the market, they told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyers still find our prices unattractive and turned to countries like Pakistan whose prices are still lower than ours despite a recent surge,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The amount of rice available in the market is also lower-than-expected...perhaps by hoarding as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Industry sources said they expected the Philippines to ink a rice deal with Thailand during an official visit by Chavalit to Manila from January 29-30.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that the Philippines have got the result of their rice survey, they are probably ready to order,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>The price of Thai benchmark 100 percent grade B this week was steady at US$380- $400 per tonne FOB Bangkok and fragrant 100 percent grade rice was unchanged at $620-$630.</p>
<p>Malaysia bought 20,000 tonnes of glutinous rice and 100 percent grade B rice from Thailand in a recent tender for February-March shipment, trade sources said.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia also made enquiries but did not buy due to high prices, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the price to nudge lower if buying interest is this thin,&quot; the trader said.</p>
