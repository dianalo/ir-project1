<p>The Congress of South African Trade Union's plans for strike action to press its demands on new labour legislation were irresponsible and would harm economic growth, Business South Africa (BSA) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The business grouping was reacting to Cosatu's earlier statement that it planned to strike for two full days as well as launch a programme of regional action in defence of its demands on the Basic Conditions of Employment bill.</p>
<p>&quot;The reaction of business to the latest decision by Cosatu is one of shock that the economy is to be put at risk in this way,&quot; BSA said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The Cosatu actions are irresponsible and will be harmful to economic growth, job creation and South Africa's international image,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>It called on Labour Minister Tito Mboweni to initiate negotiations on the issue through the National Economic Development and Labour Council, which groups labour, government and business.</p>
<p>South African business and labour have clashed on the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill, with Cosatu -- which has nearly two million members -- calling a one-day national stoppage earlier this month to drive home its claims.</p>
<p>The labour federation is calling for, among other things, a 40-hour working week and six months paid maternity leave.</p>
<p>Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa said the federation remained available for talks with government on the bill but would not engage with business unless there was a major revision of its position.</p>
