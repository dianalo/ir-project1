<p>Prime Minister John Major's hopes of delaying Britain's general election to a time of his choosing rose on Sunday when the main opposition Labour party conceded that it was unlikely to win a crucial parliamentary censure motion.</p>
<p>Labour has called for a vote in parliament on Monday on whether to censure Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg for his handling of the crisis over mad cow disease.</p>
<p>A defeat for Major would trigger a confidence vote in the government the next day. If he lost that vote, the prime minister would be obliged to resign and call an early general election.</p>
<p>But Labour leader Tony Blair admitted that the odds were stacked against his party in Monday's late-evening vote (expected after 2200 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that we will win the argument. Winning the vote will be more difficult. We will muster as much support as we can, but are aware that for now, at least, the government can probably scrape through,&quot; Blair wrote in the Express on Sunday newspaper.</p>
<p>Major's Conservative party has 323 voting members in the lower House of Commons, a number exactly matched by the combined opposition parties.</p>
<p>Even if all the opposition members of parliament voted against the government, the speaker's casting vote would ensure Major's survival.</p>
<p>In the event, however, the nine members of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who represent Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority, are expected -- as they usually do -- either to abstain or to vote with the government.</p>
<p>Although the UUP is angry over the government's failure to get the European Union to lift a ban on British beef exports imposed last March due to fears of mad cow disease, it is irked at not being consulted by Labour over the censure motion.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the matter has not been handled well, and for that reason I think the government probably will survive, but we will wait and see,&quot; the UUP's Ken Maginnis told Channel Four television.</p>
<p>Despite the promising signs, government business managers are taking no chances. Both Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and his deputy Jeremy Hanley are cutting short official overseas visits to get back to London in time to vote.    Major must hold</p>
<p>an election by May 22, marking the end of the current five-year parliamentary term, but constitutionally he has the power to go the polls when he chooses.</p>
<p>Major said last week the election would not be held later than May 1 and a new opinion poll showed why he is likely to soldier on until then in the hope that rising living standards will lift his party off the electoral rocks.</p>
<p>An NOP survey for the Sunday Times newspaper of 1,576 adults showed Labour with 49 percent of the vote, the same as last month, while the Conservatives slipped to 31 percent from 32 percent.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times described Labour's lead as rock-solid and said Blair was sailing to power with apparent ease.</p>
<p>Given that, some politicians believe the Labour leader's harrying tactics could backfire because a victory for Major on the censure motion would boost Conservative morale.</p>
<p>&quot;They've handled it in an uncharacteristically clumsy way and the resut is, I suspect, because the Irishmen won't vote for it... that the government will not be damaged.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed it may well be that the outcome of this is the opposite of what Labour intended and wanted -- which is the government is marginally strengthened,&quot; Paddy Ashdown, leader of the minority Liberal Democrats, told Sky television.</p>
