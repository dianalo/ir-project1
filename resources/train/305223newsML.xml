<p>The U.S. currency ended the European session firmer after benign U.S. inflation data did nothing to dissuade dollar bulls, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar hit a fresh 29-month high against the mark at 1.5955 in the wake of consumer price figures showing a rise of just 0.1 percent in the core CPI rate.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark strength spilled over into dollar/yen, which ticked above 117 yen to a high of 117.04, also a fresh high.</p>
<p>The dollar took its cue from Treasuries buoyed by the benign inflation data. Economists expected a rise of 0.2 percent in the core rate. Retail sales rose 0.6 percent versus 0.5 expected.  </p>
<p>&quot;The data were mixed for the dollar but did nothing to substantially change the currency market's view about rising U.S. interest rates,&quot; said Robert Prior, European economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a market that bets on higher U.S. rates and lower German rates, and it wants to see the dollar go higher,&quot; said Prior. &quot;And as long as you get data showing the economy is ticking along fine the dollar will extend its gains.&quot;</p>
<p>Benign inflation data tend to put a dampener on interest rate rise expectations while firm retail sales usually help to fuel them.  </p>
<p>The subdued CPI data helped to dispel inflation fears sparked by robust non-farm payroll and average hourly earnings growth, as seen in the December jobs report last Friday.</p>
<p>Retail sales growth, meanwhile, looked robust enough to bet on strong fourth-quarter GDP data, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The data look consistent with fourth-quarter GDP of around the three percent mark, which is unsustainably strong for the Fed,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economist at Bank of America.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that growth is running close enough to inflation thresholds to keep the risk of Fed tightening very much alive,&quot; said Hawkins.  </p>
<p>The dollar also gained on the back of comments from Bundesbank council member Helmut Hesse who said he could not rule out mark weakness in the run-up to European monetary union, as some investors may switch holdings into other currencies.</p>
<p>His colleague Olaf Sievert said earlier there was no reason why the German central bank should take a firmer grip on rates. Whether there was room for manoeuvre on the downside remained to be seen, he said.</p>
<p>Sievert also said the mark's 1995 appreciation had been corrected now, which put a slight dampener on the dollar in morning trade.  </p>
<p>Chartists pointed to the dollar's still favourable technical outlook. The most immediate obstacle is a resistance line at around 1.5960 marks, dating back to the peaks of 1989. This would have to be broken convincincly to take on the 1.60 threshold.</p>
<p>The next target will be 1.6060, an area marking a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the entire decline from 1.7686 on February 28, 1994 to the record low at 1.3430 on March 31, 1995.</p>
