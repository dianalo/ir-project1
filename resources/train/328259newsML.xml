<p>Afghanistan's Islamic Taleban militia said it was thrusting up the Salang Pass and towards the Panjsher Valley after capturing two key towns from opposition forces north of Kabul on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forces are advancing towards Salang and Panjsher,&quot; Qari Rahmatullah, a senior Taleban communications officer, told Reuters in Kabul. &quot;We have taken many prisoners and there are many enemy bodies lying on both sides of the road.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Taleban forces had captured Jabal-os-Siraj, a garrison town 70 km (44 miles) north of Kabul, in a two-pronged assault from the south and east early in the morning.</p>
<p>They had also seized Gulbahar, about 15 km (nine miles) to the northeast at the mouth of the rugged Panjsher Valley.</p>
<p>Rahmatullah said the Taleban had captured 40 tanks from opposition forces led by ousted government commander Ahmad Shah Masood and his former rival, General Abdul Rashid Dostum.</p>
<p>Sources quoted by the Pakistan-based Islamic Afghan Press (AIP) said the Taleban had captured at least 80 opposition soldiers in the fighting, in which at least six Taleban and 11 opposition fighters were reported to have been killed.</p>
<p>AIP quoted Mullah Abdul Jalil, the Taleban's Kandahar-based acting deputy foreign minister, as saying a pro-Taleban uprising had taken place in the town of Ghorband, demoralising the defenders of Jabal-os-Siraj, 30 km (19 miles) to the east.</p>
<p>The loss of Jabal-os-Siraj and Gulbahar, both bastions of Masood, is a major setback for the anti-Taleban alliance that has been trying to recapture Kabul since it fell in September.</p>
<p>Jabal-os-Siraj, often used by Masood as his headquarters, lies at the foot of the towering Salang Pass on the main road from the Afghan capital to Dostum's northern heartland.</p>
<p>Gulbahar commands the entrance to the Tajik-populated Panjsher Valley, scene of many of Masood's famed guerrilla exploits against Soviet occupation troops in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Taleban achieved their latest advance a week after capturing the Soviet-built military airbase at Bagram and the nearby town of Charikar, about 50 km (31 miles) north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Taleban forces are now back where they were soon after driving Masood's forces and the Tajik-dominated government led by Burhanuddin Rabbani out of Kabul on September 27.</p>
<p>At that time Masood retreated inside the Panjsher Valley, dynamiting the steep hillsides at its mouth to create landslides that prevented the Taleban from moving armour inside.</p>
<p>The Taleban failed to progress more than a few km (miles) beyond Gulbahar despite repeated assaults and eventually had to beat a rapid retreat when a Masood commander launched a counter-attack down the Salang Pass to retake Jabal-os-Siraj.</p>
<p>The Islamic warriors, seeking to spread their purist vision of Islam across Afghanistan, were then driven back to within 20 km (13 miles) of Kabul as pro-Masood Tajik villagers in the Shomali Valley harried them with hit-and-run attacks.</p>
<p>But they doggedly held on to a line of low hills just north of Kabul and a military stalemate ensued.</p>
