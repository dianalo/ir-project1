<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised Argentina and its Mercosur customs union partners on Monday that Germany would do all in its power to ensure they get access to the markets of the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Free trade for us is as important as oxygen to others and we want an open relationship with Argentina and Mercosur,&quot; Kohl said at a joint news conference with President Carlos Menem in Buenos Aires, first stop on a Latin American tour.</p>
<p>&quot;We will do all in our power to make Europe open, nothing of a 'closed shop,'&quot; he said, pledging practical help from Germany along the lines of a $100 million Mercedes-Benz plant near Buenos Aires he was due to inaugurate on Monday.</p>
<p>The Mercosur customs union, which was inaugurated early last year, groups Argentina and its neighbours Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay into a market of more than 200 million consumers. It has lost out to other emerging markets in luring German investment but Kohl was accompanied on this trip by heads of 17 big firms including carmakers Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, electronics giant Siemens and chemicals firm Degussa.</p>
<p>Mercosur and the European Union began working towards a free trade association last December but Mercosur exporters are calling for reductions in European farm subsidies.</p>
<p>Kohl was full of praise for the transformations Argentina has undergone since his last visit in 1984, when the country was emerging from six years of military rule under the democratic leadership of Radical President Raul Alfonsin.</p>
<p>&quot;Argentina has changed dramatically. It has had a huge boom and the economy has advanced with giant steps,&quot; he said, promising that Argentina's main trade partner in Europe would provide &quot;new dynamism&quot; in their trading relationship.</p>
<p>Kohl also praised Peronist leader Menem for his economic advances since coming to power in 1989 that include turning hyperinflation into zero inflation and keeping the peso pegged at par to the dollar.</p>
<p>Kohl, who invited Menem to make a third visit to Germany as president next year, flies to Brazil on Tuesday for talks with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, then moves to Mexico on Thursday to meet President Ernesto Zedillo.</p>
