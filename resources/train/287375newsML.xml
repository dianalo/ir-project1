<headline>EMERGENCY WEATHER CONDITIONS - WSC - 05-JAN.</headline>
<text>
<p>Tropical Cyclone Drena is in the eastern Coral Sea. Top winds are near 130 mph and may intensify slightly during the next 12-18 hours before slight weakening begins. The track of the storm is expected to become more southeast, and this will increase the threat to western New Caledonia by 48 hours. By that time, top winds will still be over 100 mph. This storm will be a major threat to shipping in the eastern Coral Sea this period.  </p>
<p>Tropical Cyclone Rachel, with 65 mph winds, is off the northwestern Australia coast, northwest of Derby, moving southwestward parallel to the coastline. It may intensify slightly but should remain mostly offshore, threatening shipping. Some of the heavy rainbands may move onshore and cause local flash flooding with heavy rainfall this period.  </p>
<p>Tropical Cyclone Fabriola has moved across Madagascar and is now just off the west coast in the Mozambique Channel. It has weakened and top winds are near 35 mph. It should weaken and become extratropical in the Mozambique Channel this period. This storm will be a moderate threat to shipping, with the threat decreasing with time.</p>
