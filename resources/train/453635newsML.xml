<p>Prices of most Indian metals firmed during the past week as import arrivals had slowed down, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Metal prices this week are strong. It is moving upwards,&quot; said Sharad Parikh, president of the Bombay Metals Exchange.</p>
<p>India imports aluminium, copper and zinc to meet growing its industry needs.</p>
<p>Traders said imports had been very limited in the past three or four months on expectations of duty changes in the 1997/98 (April-March) federal budget and because of high prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME).</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in his budget presented in February halved import duty on nickel to 10 percent to help the domestic steel industry, in which nickel is a crucial component.</p>
<p>Chidambaram reduced import duty on tin to 20 percent from 30 percent to help the domestic alloys industry and provided relief to the aluminium industry, by raising import duty on aluminium by 10 percent to 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect base metal prices to move up in the coming days on fresh buying support&quot; Parikh said.</p>
<p>Traders said imported copper was currently quoted higher than the prices quoted by state-run Hindustan Copper Ltd.</p>
<p>Parikh said LME prices of aluminium was also moving upwards and traders preferred to buy the metal domestically.</p>
<p>The domestic aluminium industry is saddled with inventories.</p>
<p>Parikh said imported aluminium ingots after import duties and other levies worked out to about 90 rupees per kg compared with the domestic price of around 75-77 rupees.</p>
<p>Traders said the price of zinc was also firming up in line with international trends.</p>
<p>In the week to Wednesday, copper and aluminium gained 1,000 rupees per tonne while zinc gained 1,500 rupees. Tin prices remained unchanged but nickel lost 2,000.</p>
