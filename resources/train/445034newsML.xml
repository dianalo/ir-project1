<p>Zaire rebel leader Laurent Kabila said on Saturday his forces captured the strategic city of Kisangani and would liberate the whole country, ruling out a ceasefire before negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;The military commander at the front said the town was liberated at 1445 (1245 GMT). He said the enemy had crossed the river and we are looking for boats so that we can pursue them,&quot; Kabila told a news conference in the eastern town of Goma.  </p>
<p>Kisangani residents contacted from Kinshasa confirmed the fall of the city, the army's headquarters for operations in the war zone. They said Zaire soldiers fled late on Friday and early on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;They left this morning and last night after looting what they could in the short space of time that they had,&quot; one resident told Reuters.</p>
<p>Another resident said small groups of rebels had gathered in the city centre and that residents were coming out to welcome them.</p>
<p>The fall of Kisangani is the biggest setback for the government since the rebels took up arms in October, vowing to topple absent and ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko. They hold up to a fifth of the sprawling nation.</p>
