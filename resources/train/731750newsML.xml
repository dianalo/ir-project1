<p>Shooting erupted in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville on Wednesday night although state radio, suggesting moves towards peace, reported that rival fighters had met to end the country's civil strife.</p>
<p>The radio, heard across the river in Kinshasa after over 40 minutes of sustained shellfire and other shooting, said supporters of President Pascal Lissouba and his predecessor Denis Sassou Nguesso met in a city centre appartment block.</p>
<p>It said they had tears in their eyes and spoke of reconciliation. State television showed the two sides fraternising.</p>
<p>Mohamed Sahnoun, the U.N. and Organisation for African Unity special envoy, said after talking to both sides in Brazzaville on Tuesday that their representatives could meet in Gabon's capital Libreville late Thursday or early Friday.</p>
<p>Lissouba and Sassou, Congo's former military leader, have put their names to a truce that took effect at midnight on Monday.</p>
<p>The latest shooting sounded like a breach of the truce but residents in Brazzaville denied that the two sides were firing at one each other. Sporadic firing continued into the evening.</p>
<p>The shooting coincided with firing on the Kinshasa side of the river in Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of the Congo, where state television urged people to remain calm and blamed &quot;a mere misunderstanding between certain units of the armed forces&quot;. No further details were available.</p>
<p>Brazzaville residents and aid workers said earlier that the truce had been more or less respected despite the occasional sporadic&quot; outburst of shooting.</p>
<p>Numerous ceasefires have been declared since a bloody showdown erupted between supporters of Lissouba and Sassou on June 5, but none had been strictly adhered to.</p>
<p>Gabonese President Omar Bongo is attempting to mediate in the conflict, which began after soldiers surrounded Sassou's home as part of a crackdown on private militia ahead of a now postponed July 27 presidential election.</p>
<p>Sahnoun has said the aim is to secure conditions to enable a presidential election to be held within the next two months. Plans for a U.N.-sponsored mainly African peace force are taking shape.</p>
<p>Medical workers say hundreds of people including many civilians have been killed in the political and ethnic clashes in Brazzaville, capital of the oil-producing former French colony.</p>
<p>French troops earlier evacuated almost 6,000 foreign nationals.</p>
