<p>Colin Montgomerie lost an encounter with a bunker rake as Scotland forfeited their chance of retaining the Alfred Dunhill Cup on Friday.</p>
<p>And Welshman Mark Mouland lost out to the rulebook and was disqualified.</p>
<p>World number two Montgomerie's second shot at the par-four sixth hole struck a rake outside a greenside bunker and bounded into the sand underneath the lip from where escape was impossible.</p>
<p>He took two to get out, then three-putted for a seven and never fully recovered as he went down to an ignominious 78-79 defeat by India's 696th-ranked Gaurav Ghei.</p>
<p>Scotland lost the tie 2-1, their second defeat in two days.</p>
<p>Montgomerie said afterwards he felt he had been hard done by.</p>
<p>&quot;Rakes in my opinion should be in the hazard and not outside, obstructing the ball and therefore the play.</p>
<p>&quot;The observer at that hole said my ball was going to miss the bunker. Instead it hit the rake and went in under the lip.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of pot bunkers out there and an awful lot of rakes outside the bunkers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mouland had already lost his match against Ernie Els by 70-80 when he was  disqualified for an infraction at the long 14th hole.</p>
<p>He hit his second into a bunker and found his ball was unplayable, but could not take a penalty drop in the bunker because he would have been nearer the hole.</p>
<p>So he dropped outside the bunker. It was later determined that he had dropped at the wrong place and should have returned to where he had hit the shot into the bunker and replayed it.</p>
<p>As he had hit his ball from the wrong place, he was disqualified under rule 20-7.</p>
