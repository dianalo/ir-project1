<p>Nearly 5,500 union workers walked off the job at a General Motors Corp. pickup truck plant after bargainers failed to agree on a new contract by an 11:59 p.m. Tuesday strike deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;We're out,&quot; said Roger Coats, financial secretary of United Auto Worker Local 594.</p>
<p>The strike at GM's Pontiac East plant in Pontiac, Michigan was the fourth time U.S. union members have struck the world's largest automaker since January in separate clashes over jobs and work that GM wants sent to outside suppliers.</p>
<p>The latest strike involves 4,100 members from Local 594 who work on the assembly line at GM's Pontiac East truck assembly plant. Another 1,300 union members work in engineering and prototype jobs associated with GM's Truck Product Center, located near the plant.</p>
<p>Also affected by the walkout would be 450 members of Local 594 who work at a Lear Corp. seating plant in nearby Rochester Hills, Michigan. The workers were hired two years ago as part of an agreement to settle a strike at the Pontiac plant.</p>
<p>The GM facility makes the popular and high-profit full-size regular cab and extended cab GMC Sierra and Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks. It also makes chassis cab trucks.</p>
<p>The plant produced 72,000 vehicles in the first three months of this year, equal to a weekly output of about 6,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>GM's national contract with the UAW, signed last November, allows it to reduce its U.S. hourly work force of 215,000 by about 30,000 over the three-year pact. GM still has to reach tentative agreements with 25 percent of its 105 UAW locals, far behind the other members of the U.S. Big Three.</p>
<p>Jim Abare, an official at Local 594, would not say specifically what the union was demanding, although he said manpower disputes were the major concerns. The union also wants GM to resolve occupational health issues and live up to promises it made to settle the strike in 1995, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was signed, sealed, but never delivered,&quot; Abare said of the 1995 settlement.</p>
<p>GM is still battling a strike at its Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, car plant by 3,500 members of UAW Local 1999 that started on April 4. The plant makes the Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass, two mid-size sedans crucial to GM's U.S. sales strategy.</p>
<p>GM spokesman Vince Muniga said on Tuesday talks continue in Oklahoma City, with a number of issues being resolved within the last few days.</p>
