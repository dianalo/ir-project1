<headline>Swiss franc ends firmer vs dollar, steady vs mark.</headline>
<text>
<p>1645 GMT - The Swiss franc ended firmer against the dollar but little changed against the mark in uneven trading sparked in large part by the U.S. cruise missile attack on targets in Iraq.</p>
<p>But traders said the dollar had a firm undertone on continuing concern that U.S interest rates would have to rise amid signals of strong growth, reinforced by a rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management index in August.</p>
<p>&quot;The NAPM report was in line with expectations, but the interest rate fear still continues,&quot; one dealer at a Swiss bank said. But she added the dollar would have to break through resistance at 1.2130 francs to confirm the trend.  </p>
<p>The mark would also have to penetrate the key psychological point of 81.50 Swiss centimes to advance much more, she said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was already downplaying the impact of the U.S. attack on Iraq, which pushed the dollar to the upper end of its ranges. &quot;If nothing unexpected happens, we should stay around these levels,&quot; a dealer at a big Swiss bank said.</p>
<p>* Dollar ends at 1.2068/2078 Swiss francs compared with 1.2093/2103 at Monday's close. It opened at 1.2102/2107.</p>
<p>* Mark closes at 81.34/36 Swiss centimes, just below the previous close at 81.37/39 centimes but up from 81.25/28 at the opening on Tuesday.</p>
