<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday tried to quash speculation he was about to axe ministers in his unpopular government to improve re-election prospects.</p>
<p>Reacting to a surprise call by Finance Minister Theo Waigel to reshuffle the cabinent, a government spokesman said Kohl has no plans to replace any of his ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;A reshuffle is not under consideration at the moment,&quot; said spokesman Herbert Schmuelling, speaking for Kohl who is on holiday in Austria.</p>
<p>The denial failed to quell the sudden revival of speculation that the chancellor will shake up his 17-member cabinet before the elections due in September 1998.</p>
<p>Another government official, who declined to be named, told Reuters the spokesman's comments did not rule anything out because it only applied &quot;at the moment&quot;.</p>
<p>Commentators said a shakeup was overdue and could reverse the government's steep slide in opinion polls.</p>
<p>With his grand tax reform foiled by the powerful opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and the economy growing too slowly dent the record unemployment, analysts said Kohl had little else up his sleeve to boost popularity.</p>
<p>&quot;Kohl has to act now,&quot; said the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. &quot;He should thank Waigel because without any fresh faces in the cabinet, even members of Kohl's Christian Democrats believe the next election will be extremely hard to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohl's Christian Democrats would win just 37 percent of the vote, down five points from the 1994 election, according to an Emnid Institute poll.</p>
<p>The SPD would win 38 percent, up two points from 1994, and could easily form a coalition with the environmentalist Greens, who have gone up to 10 percent in the latest poll.</p>
<p>With an eye on the poll, Waigel said in weekend interviews that Kohl should replace several ministers before the 1998 campaign.</p>
<p>Suggesting some ministers were just trying to hang on to their jobs until the election, Waigel urged Kohl to drop any who were tiring well before the campaign starts.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a minister or two wanting to leave but eager to hang on until the election, one should tell him 'Comrade, it would be nice, but we have to form our new team now',&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Waigel, fed up with the frustrating finance ministry,  has long sought the job of Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and, as a loyal ally of Kohl, his remarks were assumed to have at least the chancellor's tacit endorsement.</p>
<p>Ruediger Moniac, a columnist for Die Welt, said Waigel would under normal circumstances have proffered the advice in a private conversation with the chancellor.</p>
<p>&quot;Or was it the other way around?&quot; wrote Moniac, questioning whether Kohl instructed Waigel to drop the bombshell. &quot;Has the chancellor decided to reshuffle his cabinet soon and dispatched Waigel to prepare the public? It cannot be ruled out.&quot;</p>
<p>Although Kohl made numerous major changes in his cabinet in his first three terms, there has only been one minor change in the first three years of his fourth term -- the FDP justice minister resigned and was replaced by another FDP politician.</p>
<p>Among the ministers considered to be on the short list to be dropped are Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP), Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (CDU), Labour Minister Norbert Bluem (CDU) and Family Minister Claudia Nolte (CDU).</p>
