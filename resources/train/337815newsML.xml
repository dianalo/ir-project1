<title>USA: Wife says Cosby's affair is no longer an issue.</title>
<headline>Wife says Cosby's affair is no longer an issue.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-01-28</dateline>

<p>The wife of entertainer Bill Cosby made clear on Tuesday she stood by him, saying the affair he disclosed this week was an old issue that had long been resolved.</p>
<p>Camille Cosby, the star's wife of 33 years, said what was important to her was that authorities arrest the murderer of the couple's 27-year-old son Ennis, gunned down on Jan. 16 as he changed a tire on a Los Angeles freeway.</p>
<p>In his first interview since the killing, Bill Cosby told CBS News anchorman Dan Rather this week that he had had a &quot;rendezvous&quot; with the mother of 22-year-old Autumn Jackson, but he denied being Jackson's father.</p>
<p>Jackson and Jose Medina, 51, were arrested recently on charges they demanded money from Cosby to keep them from selling a story to a tabloid newspaper alleging that Jackson was the entertainer's illegitimate daughter.</p>
<p>Camille Cosby made clear in a statement issued by Cosby's publicist that the affair was no longer an issue between her and her husband.</p>
<p>&quot;All old personal negative issues were resolved by Bill and me years ago. We are a united couple. What occurred 23 years ago is not important to me except for the current issue of extortion,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is very important to me is for the authorities to apprehend the person or persons who killed our son,&quot; she said, appealing to the public to help find the murderer or murderers.</p>
<p>Jackson was released from prison on Monday night after two people guaranteed her $250,000 bond. Authorities have said the alleged extortion attempt is not related to Ennis Cosby's murder.</p>
<p>A woman who saw part of the attack on Ennis Cosby gave police a description of the killer as a white male wearing a knit cap. The description was used to put together a composite drawing of the suspect but no arrests have been made so far.</p>
