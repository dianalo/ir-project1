<p>Taiwan on Wednesday donated $4 million to Malawi to build houses for the southern African country's soldiers.</p>
<p>Taiwanese Foreign Minister John Chang, who is on a official visit to Malawi, said his government would continue to help Malawi.</p>
<p>&quot;We have proof that we are your trustworthy friend. You can count on us in time of need,&quot; Chang told Malawi President Bakili Muluzi during a meeting in Blantyre.</p>
<p>Chang said Taiwan -- competing with the People's Republic of China for relations with some African countries -- would abide by the commitments it had made to Malawi since 1965 when the two countries established diplomatic ties.</p>
<p>&quot;The Republic of China will stand firm at your side,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Muluzi said earlier that Malawi as a sovereign state wanted its bilateral relationship with Taiwan to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;This relationship must continue for the betterment of our people. This relationship is based on solid foundation and we must make sure it continues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Muluzi said it was also the responsibility of his government to seek technical cooperation with Taiwan in agriculture, education, health and manufacturing.</p>
<p>The $4 million aid would be used to improve accommodation for Malawi soldiers. Some soldiers have been living in run-down barracks and others in rented housing.</p>
