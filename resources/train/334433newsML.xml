<p>French President Jacques Chirac will meet Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday in Moscow as planned, a Kremlin spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier the Kremlin announced Yeltsin, recovering from double pneumonia, had cancelled a planned trip to the Netherlands to meet Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on February 4.  </p>
<p>&quot;The meeting (between Yeltsin and Chirac) will take place as planned. The president is advised only to refrain from flying,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The two leaders are due to meet on February 2 in Yeltsin's country residence at Gorky-9 outside Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who left hospital on January 12, is recovering smoothly from his illness, his aides say. He has met senior officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and works for several hours each day on documents.</p>
<p>But the cancellation of a planned summit of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on January 29 and of Yeltsin's trip to the Netherlands next month have revived fears about the president's ability to rule the vast country.</p>
