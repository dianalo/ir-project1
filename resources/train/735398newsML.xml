<headline>Ossetia bus attack sparks fears of new conflict.</headline>

<p>A bazooka round fired at a bus carrying refugees home to the Russian region of North Ossetia injured 17 people on Thursday, prompting fears of a renewed communal conflict in Russia's volatile south.</p>
<p>Officials in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia said three unidentified gunmen fired at the bus in North Ossetia's Prigorodny district, where the refugees were returning after a bitter conflict in 1992.</p>
<p>In that year tens of thousands Moslem Ingushis had to flee their homes in the disputed district controlled by Christian Ossetians. Nearly 200 people were killed.</p>
<p>Ingush President Ruslan Aushev accused North Ossetian leaders of sabotaging an agreed programme of repatriation of the refugees and deliberately provoking a new conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingushi conflict is heating up day after day though we still manage to keep it under control,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Aushev as saying.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from North Ossetia.</p>
<p>More than 20 attacks against Ingush refugees returning to their homes in Prigorodny district, controlled by North Ossetia, have been committed in the last month, raising ethnic tension in the North Caucasus.</p>
<p>Ingush officials said the latest attack was carried out from a North Ossetian police checkpoint 15 km (10 miles) from the Ingush border after the bus had passed it.</p>
<p>They said no one was killed, denying an earlier report from local authorities that at least two people had died as the bus, returning from Ingushetia to neighbouring North Ossetia, was targeted with grenade launchers.</p>
<p>&quot;Fresh reports from the scene have no information about people killed in the bus. But all 17 have been wounded and 12 of them are in hospital in a serious condition,&quot; said Manlis Chakhkiyev, Aushev's spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;An 11-year-old girl is in an especially serious state. Her arms are being amputated at the hospital,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aushev issued a statement asking President Boris Yeltsin to impose direct presidential rule in the area to avoid new bloodshed and warned North Ossetia that he was ready to take steps to protect the refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;If the federal government and the leadership of North Ossetia do not take measures, we will not leave the Ingushi people defenceless,&quot; Aushev vowed on Russian television.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted the Ingush administration as saying that Yeltsin and Aushev had discussed the situation by telephone but gave no further details.</p>
<p>The North Ossetian leader Akhsarbek Galazov has rejected accusations and has said that Aushev was overestimating the danger of the situation.</p>
<p>Hostility between Russia's allies, Christian Ossetians, and independence-minded Moslem Ingushis, who are ethnic kin of rebel Chechens, is one of the oldest coflicts in the North Caucasus.</p>
<p>It was further stoked by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who expelled Ingushis in 1944 and gave some of their territories, including Prigorodny district, to the Ossetians.</p>
<p>The dispute over the district degenerated into bloody clashes, the first inter-ethnic conflict in post-Soviet Russia.</p>
