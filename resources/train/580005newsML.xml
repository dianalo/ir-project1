<p>COMEX copper futures were seen opening slightly lower Tuesday, in line with LME copper prices, after a small rise in LME warehouse copper stocks.</p>
<p>COMEX July was seen opening unchanged to down 0.20 cent a pound from Monday's close at 113.10 cents, after trading a 113.00-112.85 cent range in overnight ACCESS trade.</p>
<p>LME copper stocks rose 525 tonnes Tuesday to 152,125 tonnes, while COMEX copper stocks were down 759 short tons Monday to 41,886 short tons.</p>
<p>Producer forward selling was seen limiting the recent rally, but Japanese buying was seen supportive, traders said.</p>

<p>Potential supply disruptions also are hanging over the market, traders said.</p>
<p>Two power cuts in the last 24 hours caused by rain and high winds in northern Chile have created production problems, with El Abra facing a possible loss of 100 tonnes of cathode, an official at the plant said Monday.</p>
<p>Chile's huge Chuquicamata mine's daily production was also cut Sunday by 10 to 15 percent because of bad weather, but monthly and quarterly output should not be affected, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>Workers at Phelps Dodge Corp's Chino copper mine in New Mexico, without contracts since June 30 1996, will protest outside the company's Phoenix head office Thursday this week, and the union filed three more charges against Phelps with the National Labor Relations Board last week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile wage talks at BHP Copper's San Manuel and Pinto Valley plants in Arizona start Tuesday when the United Steelworkers will ask for a &quot;significant&quot; pay hike, a union official said.</p>
