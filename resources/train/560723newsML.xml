<headline>Iran's Velayati in Cairo on landmark visit.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in Cairo on Monday for the first high-level meeting between Egypt and Iran since Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak accused Tehran of trying to kill him in 1995.</p>
<p>Airport officials said Velayati was met at Cairo airport by Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and officials said the two men were expected to hold formal talks later on Monday.</p>
<p>The Iranian official is also due to meet Mubarak on Tuesday to invite him to a Islamic conference to be held in Iran in December, Egyptian officials said.</p>
<p>Ties between Cairo and Tehran have been strained for years over policy differences.</p>
<p>Egypt has accused Iran and Sudan of continuing support for the al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group), the largest organisation fighting to set up a strict Islamic state in Egypt. Both Sudan and Iran deny this.</p>
<p>Iran was also accused of being behind the attempted assassination of Mubarak during the Egyptian leader's visit to Ethiopia in 1995.</p>
<p>Velayati last visited Cairo in 1994 to attend a Non-Aligned Movement meeting of foreign ministers.</p>
