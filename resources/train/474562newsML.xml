<p>Shares on the Cyprus bourse jumped 3.02 percent during the week, mainly inspired by buying in the banking sector, especially of Hellenic Bank  HBCP.CY, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The upsurge in the volume was definitely related to the Hellenic Bank shares,&quot; said Christodoulos Ellinas of Share Link.</p>
<p>Hellenic fully paid shares closed at 293.5 on Friday, up 2.5 percent from last week's close of 286.5.</p>
<p>Newspapers have speculated that local businessman Nicos Shakolas, who chairs a number of companies on the 41-share bourse, is trying to increase his stake in the bank to five percent.</p>
<p>The Shakolas Group has not commented on the speculation, fuelled by news of an off-the-floor purchase of 220,000 Hellenic shares by Interamerican Insurance, which is controlled by the group.</p>
<p>The Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) index closed at 81.03 on Friday from 78.65 last week, with gains recorded in all seven sub indices.</p>
<p>The bank index, the strongest on the bourse, closed with gains of 3.65 percent, approved investment firms with gains of 6.9 percent and insurance companies gains of 3 percent.</p>
<p>The temporary suspension of trade in cement industries Vassiliko Cement and the Cyprus Cement Company was still in force by the CSE board of directors on Friday.</p>
<p>The CSE temporarily suspended trading in shares of the two companies on March 11 amid unconfirmed reports Cyprus Cement was making a bid for the full or partial takeover of Vassiliko.</p>
<p>Bourse sources told Reuters the suspension would probably be lifted by the middle of next week following the approval by parliament of a mergers and acquisition bill last Thursday.</p>
<p>The bill guarantees equal treatment of shareholders in bid situations, with offers being made to all shareholders on a pro-rata basis.</p>
