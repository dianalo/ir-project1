<title>USA: Kmart, other US high-yield debt firm before supply.</title>
<headline>Kmart, other US high-yield debt firm before supply.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kmart bonds remained firm on takeover talk at midday, traders said, with other U.S. corporate high-yield prices stable with a firm bias despite prospects for $2.5 billion in issuance before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Investment-grade trade, meanwhile, was also subordinated to a bustling primary market as issuers prepared to capitalize on long-Treasury yields well below 6-1/2 percent.</p>
<p>Topping junk trade, Kmart Corp debt was mostly quiet but firm at midday following rumors on Tuesday that the retailer is a target for buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts &amp; Co. Some longer debt was quoted higher, however, one trader said.  </p>
<p>Kmart's 7.95s of 2023 were bid at 77 compared with an earlier quoted of 76-5/8 bid, 77-1/2 offer.</p>
<p>Both Kmart and KKR had declined comment on the rumor.</p>
<p>Traders said higher third quarter earnings reported on Wednesday failed to spark much activity for the debt. Kmart reported Q3 revenues of $7.847 billion and a 0.1 percent rise in same store sales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Trump-related debt dipped amid heightened uncertainty surrounding an expected investment in Trump's Castle in Atlantic City, traders said. Trump Castle debt was down about one point to 92-1/2, said one trader.  </p>
<p>Otherwise, by all accounts, new issue talk surrounding the host of high-yield issues set to price took precedence, traders said. Buyers can absorb the paper, one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market didn't think (buyers) could take the supply you'd see the secondary trade off a lot and you haven't seen that,&quot; the trader said. &quot;Remember that this is pretty much it before the end of the year, too.&quot;</p>
<p>High-yield issues priced so far on Wednesday include:</p>
<p>-- $150 million 10-year Baa3/BBB 10-year 144a notes from Aristech Chemicals Corp priced as 6-7/8s to yield 80 basis points over the Treasury curve.</p>
