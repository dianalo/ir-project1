<title>RUSSIA: Russian-US Mir crew sees in New Year in space.</title>
<headline>Russian-US Mir crew sees in New Year in space.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1996-12-31</dateline>

<p>The two Russians and one American aboard Russia's Mir space station were among the first to see the New Year in as they hurtled round the Earth in orbit.</p>
<p>But though they crossed into 1997 over New Zealand shortly before midday Greenwich Mean Time, cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Alexander Koleri and their NASA colleague John Blaha planned to celebrate only when the Kremlin bells tolled midnight at 2100 GMT.</p>
<p>At that time, Itar-Tass news agency quoted mission control saying, they would be over the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The crew, who have been in space since September, should have been home for the holidays but a Russian-German relief flight was postponed from mid-December till February in one of many snags due to the cash crisis in Russia's space industry.</p>
<p>A cargo craft which arrived five weeks ago at least spared the three men one pressing problem -- overflowing toilets caused by a breakdown in the ageing space station's recycling system.</p>
<p>Two Russian monkeys, Lapik and Multik, are also hurtling round the Earth this New Year in the company of assorted bugs, snails, flies and plants aboard the Bion-11 research craft. They are due back next week after a 14-day mission.</p>
<p>There was no word on how the pair are marking the New Year.</p>
