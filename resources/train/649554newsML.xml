<p>U.S. farm equipment manufacturer Deere and Company signed a deal on Tuesday to provide parts to build 6,400 combine harvesters in the next five years at a southern Ukrainian tractor factory, company officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;John Deere will provide components, training and technical support,&quot; Deere's Chairman Hans Becherer said at a news conference. &quot;We will provide assistance in the final manufacture of combines at Kherson.&quot;</p>
<p>He added talks would be held on formation of a joint venture between the Khersonsky Traktorny Zavod  KTZ and John Deere, which last year sealed a $187 million deal to provide 1,049 combines to Ukraine under U.S. guarantees.</p>
<p>Ukraine's farms, almost six years after independence from the Soviet Union, are suffering from severe shortages of modern machinery, as well as money and fuel.</p>
<p>Becherer said the value of the deal, which called for building 300 combines for the 1998 harvest season, would be determined by success in building and selling the equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;The total value will depend on the development of local content,&quot; he said, adding exports of combines might take place in the &quot;long term future&quot;.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Mykhailo Zubets said combines would be sold to cash-strapped farms under lease agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to furnish the agriculture sector with modern technology,&quot; he said. &quot;This will also allow us to renew this factory which in recent times has not been working.&quot;</p>
<p>Becherer said Deere was also discussing forming a joint venture with Pivdenmash in the eastern industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk.</p>
<p>A spokesman from Pivdenmash said the company, which builds missiles, buses and appliances and which has been courted by several farm machinery builders including Case Europe, would decide on a joint venture partner this month.</p>
