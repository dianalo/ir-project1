<headline>Czech PSE edges up, takeover battles buoy issues.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1996-08-27</dateline>

<p>The Prague Stock Exchange edged higher in heavier trading on Tuesday, buoyed by several broader issues involved in takeover battles.</p>
<p>Major issues were mixed with Komercni Banka backing off of Monday's year high while SPT Telecom posted modest gains as the PX50 index inched up 1.6 points to 571.6.</p>
<p>Overall, advancers outpaced decliners by 195 to 135 with 78 issues trading unchanged. Total volume was heavy with 1.16 million shares changing hands on light turnover of 534.5 million crowns.</p>
<p>But it was the performance of a few broader issues that continued to catch most analyst's attention, as rumours of takeover battles for beverage maker Seliko and glass fibre maker Vertex push prices through the roof.</p>
<p>Seliko, the object of a battle of between unnamed investment groups, jumped 158 crowns to 3,333, and hit as high as 20,000 crowns on the OTC market, according to bourse figures, though on minor volumes.</p>
<p>Vertex, also rumoured to be involved in a battle for control, climbed a solid 238 crowns to 5,009.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing is that all of these prices have nothing to do with the fundamentals, only takeover battles. Right now, I doubt many portfolio investors would buy Vertex or Seliko,&quot; said Jan Sykora of the brokerage Wood and Company.</p>
<p>&quot;You would be buying into a stock where you have no control of its price and it does not reflect the fundamentals of the company at all,&quot; he added.</p>
