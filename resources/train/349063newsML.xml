<title>FINLAND: Helsinki seen powering ahead on Nokia, Wall Street.</title>
<headline>Helsinki seen powering ahead on Nokia, Wall Street.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sharp gains in Nokia and in U.S. stocks overnight were seen taking Finnish shares broadly up on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We could add almost two percent,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Nokia closed at about 315.75 markka in New York on Thursday, up from 307.50 in Helsinki.</p>
<p>Shares in consumer goods group Fiskars were expected to be strong after announcing higher 1996 earnings and a bonus dividend. German car maker Porsche's confirmation that it would build 5,000 cars in Finland with Valmet was seen helping Valmet ahead.  </p>
<p>Tone was upbeat, bolstered by positive domestic news and by U.S. Federal Reserve governor Alan Greenspan's soothing comments on Thursday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Fed chief gave little reason to believe that the central bank was considering raising interest rates at the February 4 and 5 meetings.</p>
<p>Brokers were waiting for mobile phone maker Benefon's and oven maker Tulikivi's 1996 reports due to be released later on Friday.</p>
