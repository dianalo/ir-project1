<p>Singapore's Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on Wednesday it would tender out to the private sector this month two plots of land for the development of executive condominiums.</p>
<p>The HDB, a government body that builds subsidised housing, said in a statement this was the first time land would be tendered out for executive condominiums.</p>
<p>Under the government's Executive Condominium (EC) scheme introduced in 1995, private developers can tender for government-subsidised land to build condominiums with the quality and facilties normally provided by the private sector.  </p>
<p>But they have to price the condominums at affordable rates as they can only be bought by households with incomes not exceeding Singapore $10,000 a month.</p>
<p>The HDB statement said the two plots of land offered for tender were in Jurong West and Woodlands, in the western part of Singapore.</p>
<p>It said three more sites would be offered for sale later this year.</p>
<p>Three new executive condominium projects will be launched in the next few months. These projects will be developed on land allocated to government-linked companies.  </p>
<p>So far eight sites for such developments have been allocated to government-linked companies and three were launched between June 1996 and January 1997, the statement said.</p>
