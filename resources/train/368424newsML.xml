<p>European Commissioner Mario Monti, an Italian, said on Sunday that Italy should bring forward its 1998 budget and the government's next economic target plan to show its commitment to being a founding member of European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Monti, speaking to reporters on the fringes of a business seminar, said that if Italy wanted to be in the first wave of entrants &quot;it needs structural interventions like that on social security and has to give strong signals by anticipating the 1998 budget and the next DPEF.&quot;</p>
<p>The next DPEF, the government's three-year rolling financial target plan, is for 1998-2000.</p>
<p>&quot;With the globalisation of the economy, it is not enough to admit the existence of a problem, like what has been done many times before with pensions, but one has to demonstrate the will to resolve it,&quot; Monti said.</p>
<p>He said that certain structural measures such as the tidying up of the social security system and more flexibility in the job market would help &quot;convince European partners, above all Germany, that Italy will not return to the haphazard financial mangement of the 1970s and 1980s, but will sincerely adhere to the German model.&quot;</p>
<p>Monti said &quot;the German model&quot; was independence of the central bank, monetary stability and low inflation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who met German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on Friday, has pinned his political survival on getting Italy into the first wave of economic and monetary union (EMU), which is due to begin in 1999.</p>
<p>During that meeting, Kohl reassured Prodi that he had no objections to Italy joining Europe's planned monetary union, dismissing reports of a secret scheme to keep Rome out of the starting line-up for the single currency.</p>
