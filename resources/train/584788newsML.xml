<title>THAILAND: RESEARCH ALERT-Advanced Info rated buy.</title>

<p>Asia Equity said on Wednesday it rated Advanced Info Service Plc a buy despite an anaemic earning growth forecast for the company for 1997.</p>
<p>Asia Equity said Advanced Info has a strong long-term competitive advantage from its current heavy network expansion.  </p>
<p>Asia Equity said Advanced Info was a good bargain as it was being traded at historical low price/earning ratio of 9.8 times projected 1997 earnings and 8.8 times prospective 1998 earnings, Asia Equity said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is currently the least expensive blue-chip (telecommunication stock),&quot; Asia Equity said in a report.</p>
<p>Advanced Info is a part of telecommunicaton giant Shinawatra Group. The Shinawatra Group is involved in numerous businesses, including computers, telecommunications and broadcasting.</p>
<p>The company's principle activities are providing services for cellular telephones, paging and voice/data transmission.</p>
<p>Asia Equity said concern over the prospect of increased competition, especially in 1900 MHz cellular phone, was unjustified as Advanced Info already has a considerable lead in terms of time, technology and subscriber base.</p>
<p>&quot;Potential new competitors at 1900 MHz will face considerable competitive disadvantages,&quot; Asia Equity said.</p>
<p>&quot;A nationwide network would cost in excess of US$700 million and would need more than 600,000 subscribers (at current revenue per subscriber) to break even,&quot; it added.  </p>
<p>Asia Equity forecast Advanced Info's net profit at 3.77 billion baht ($145 million) in 1997, 4.19 billion in 1998, and 5.38 billion in 1999. ($1 = 26 baht)</p>
