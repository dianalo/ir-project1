<p>Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) in French packaging company Cofinec S.A. traded below Wednesday's levels on Thursday, bucking the Budapest bourse's bullish trend, after this morning's announcement about a merger between its two Hungarian units.</p>
<p>The GDRs opened at 5,400 forints, below Wednesday's close of 5,460 forints and closed at 5,350, down 110.</p>
<p>But a senior Cofinec official told a news conference he expected the merger to have a positive impact on Cofinec's prices later.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect an increase in price as a result of this process,&quot; Alois Manich, Cofinec's production director said.</p>
<p>The group said this morning it planned to merge its two Hungarian units, Kner Nyomdaipari Rt and Petofi Nyomdaipari es Csomagoloipari Rt, to improve performance in Hungary this year.</p>
<p>&quot;To improve productivity, to reduce costs and to increase competitiveness they (the supervisory board and the management) will propose (to shareholders) the merger of Cofinec's two Hungarian units, Petofi Rt and Kner Rt without delay,&quot; Cofinec said in a statement this morning.</p>
<p>Company officials did not release preliminary 1996 data.</p>
<p>In the January-September 1996 period Cofinec's IAS consolidated net sales slipped to 492.8 million French francs from 497.5 million francs in the same period of 1995. The company's net result showed a loss of 19.2 million francs against 13.0 million in profit in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger is an important step towards achieving the anticipated turnaround for Cofinec in 1997,&quot; Cofinec supervisory board chairman Pehr G. Gyllenhammar said in a statement released at the news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;By reorganising the companies (Petofi and Kner) to make full use of their potential, the group will be well positioned to maximise efficiency and become the high-quality, low-cost producer in the region.&quot;</p>
<p>Both companies are major suppliers to key multinational companies, Manich said.</p>
<p>The merger for which Cofinec reserved 22 million French francs, will result in personnel changes and needs the clearance of Hungary's Competition Office.</p>
<p>&quot;We regard these reserves as an investment which serves a profitable operation later,&quot; said Kner's chairman and CEO Miklos Balog, who is expected to receive the job of general director of the merged Hungarian operations.</p>
<p>Petofi Rt's general director Laszlo Sebesvari, who resigned from his position effective January 15, is to become an advisor to the group's supervisory board, advising on strategy, organisation, marketing policy and potential new projects.</p>
<p>While the merger of the two units is under preparation, Tibor Szabados, production director of Petofi Rt, will become Petofi's temporary general director.</p>
