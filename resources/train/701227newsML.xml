<p>British newspapers lavished praise on new finance minister Gordon Brown's &quot;budget for the people&quot; on Thursday, saying it revealed common sense and set out a vision for the 21st century.</p>
<p>In Labour's first budget in nearly 20 years, Brown kept promises that helped sweep the party into power in the May 1 election by not raising income tax, and provided billions of pounds for the ailing health and education systems and a programme to get young people back to work by levying a one-off windfall tax on profits of privatised utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;In today's budget I've laid the foundations for Britain's long-term future. I've put the people's priorities first, health, education, investment and jobs,&quot; he said in a televised speech.</p>
<p>Newspapers were generous in their applause.</p>
<p>&quot;This was, quite simply, a brillant budget,&quot; said the Mirror. &quot;It gives so much to those who need it, yet hardly anyone will notice the cost.&quot;</p>
<p>The top-selling Sun said Brown &quot;gives us what we really, really wanted&quot;, borrowing the phrase from the hit single by the Spice Girls rock phenomena that has swept the country.</p>
<p>The Times called it &quot;a commonsense budget that deserves support&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It was sensible to tighten fiscal policy a little, by abolishing dividend credits to pension funds, without taking large sums of money directly out of voters' pocket,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper also hailed his decision to cut the tax break homeowners get on mortgage interest payments and raise the tax on sales of expensive homes.</p>
<p>&quot;British politics used to contain one party that wanted to cut tax on principle and another that wanted to raise tax on principle. Now we have a government that seems to have no ideological preconceptions and tries to make tax changes that are appropriate to the need of the economy,&quot; the Times said.</p>
<p>Brown said he needed to put public finances in better order and promised that the government would keep it under better control.</p>
<p>He promised to cut government borrowing from 23 billion pounds ($38.10 billion) last year to 13 billion this year and five billion next year.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph called it &quot;Brown's give and takeaway&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;An unexpected 3.5 billion pounds extra for schools and hospitals sweetened Gordon Brown's 'people's budget' yesterday, but pension funds and the privatised utilities will bear the brunt of Labour's first tax rises, totalling 12 billion pound over the next two years,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The left-leaning Guardian dubbed it a &quot;tour de force&quot; but admitted that there must be doubts whether enough has been done to puncture the consumer boom.</p>
