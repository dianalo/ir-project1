<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will attempt to draw up a single draft document mapping out a new post-Cold War relationship at a meeting in Moscow on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now two draft texts -- one by Moscow, one by NATO. These two could be merged into a single one, though there would still be many brackets,&quot; said one alliance source.</p>
<p>NATO sources say they expect the third round of talks between the two sides to move on to more substantive issues ahead of a summit in Helsinki on March 21 between Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>The Mosocw meeting has been preceded by a week of frenetic diplomacy as the clock also ticks towards a NATO heads of government meeting in Madrid in July at which some former communist countries will be invited to join the alliance.</p>
<p>Moscow has maintained its opposition to NATO's plans to expand eastwards, but at the same time signalled it is hoping for a compromise on the issue -- opening the way for a new European security order for the 21st century.</p>
<p>Yeltsin stuck to this line in his annual address to parliament on Thursday, warning the continent would pay a heavy price for attempting to &quot;squeeze Russia out&quot; of Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO expansion can become a fateful decision which will cost the peoples of Europe very dear,&quot; he said, adding that building a security system in Europe without Russia was doomed to failure.</p>
<p>NATO argues that enlargement eastwards and its attempts to build a new all-encompassing relationship with Russia are two strands of the same policy and form part of the alliance's post-Cold War transformation into a political organisation.</p>
<p>Senior aides of Solana and Primakov have been working in Moscow this week preparing the ground for Sunday's meeting after Primakov, a former Russian spy-master, handed over several draft texts on different aspects of a deal in Brussels two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Several senior alliance sources say big differences remained with Moscow and no breakthrough would emerge from Sunday's exchange, but all recent signs showed the Russians now wanted to deal, even if the current price they are asking is too high.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to minimise the difficulties, but I believe they (the Russians) are interested in partnership and that we will conclude one,&quot; Solana said in London on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Russia, holding out the prospect of its own integration with Belarus, is now seeking assurances the alliance will not move any military &quot;infrastructure&quot; onto the territory of likely new members, such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>NATO says Moscow cannot have a veto on alliance activities, but stresses it has no plans to move weapons or troops into the new members.</p>
<p>Helped by the fact that no new countries are set to win formal membership before the alliance's 50th anniversary in 1999, diplomats say there is plenty of room for compromise.</p>
<p>Solana said in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro this week that some differences emanated from a lack of Russian understanding of how its old enemy worked, despite recent co-operation in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the infrastructures are national and do not come under the alliance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russia also wants the NATO-Russia document to be a legally-binding treaty, a demand designed to prevent the alliance changing its policy at a later date.</p>
<p>NATO argues this would delay any deal as it would require ratification by the parliaments of all 16 NATO members and say a politically-binding text signed by the heads of state and governments would give it more than enough weight.</p>
<p>&quot;A political document allows for progress to be made as relations develop. Any text drawn up by legal experts would be less ambitious and remain set,&quot; Solana told Figaro.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington is pushing ahead with plans to offer Moscow more sweeteners on the bilateral front. These are expected to centre on further cuts in weapons arsenals, both nuclear and non-nuclear.</p>
<p>Primakov is due to leave for Moscow after meeting Solana to follow up on these topics ahead of the Helsinki summit.</p>
