<headline>Indian PM's office denies Gujral has resigned.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>The office of Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Wednesday denied a stock market rumour that the leader had resigned.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no basis, no truth in the rumours,&quot; a spokesman for the prime minister told Reuters by telephone.  </p>
<p>Avinash Gupta, deputy general manager of the Delhi Stock Exchange, told Reuters he believed the rumour had helped drive down share prices on Indian exchanges.</p>
<p>At 3:58 p.m. (1028 GMT), the Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark index was down 27.07 points, or 0.60 percent, at 4,520.95. Traders in Bombay said profit-taking had undermined share prices on that bourse.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Gujral withdrew an insurance regulatory bill from the lower house of parliament after his government failed to muster enough votes to defeat an opposition-backed amendment.</p>
<p>Gupta said the setback could have fanned the rumour that Gujral had resigned.</p>
