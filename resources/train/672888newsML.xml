<p>An editorial cartoon against capital punishment based on the memorable photograph of a firefighter carrying a dead girl from the Oklahoma City bombing sparked outrage across America on Thursday.</p>
<p>Aren Almon Kok, the mother of Baylee Almon, the girl shown in the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph, said the cartoon by Steve Benson in the Arizona Republic newspaper was &quot;distasteful&quot; and painful.</p>
<p>Benson's cartoon showed a firefighter who was labeled &quot;death-penalty fanatics&quot; holding the child as in the photo. In this case, the infant was pleading, &quot;Please, no more killing,&quot; and the firefighter replied, &quot;Oh, stop your whining!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has ripped open my life again just when I thought it was healing. I think he owes us all an apology,&quot; Almon said.</p>
<p>She has repeatedly asked that the image not be used in bad taste or for commercial gain. Her daughter had her first birthday just one day before the bombing and was among 19 children killed in the blast.</p>
<p>The cartoon was also condemned by the fireman shown in the photograph as well as by firefighters nationwide and the governor of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Benson told Reuters the firefighters and Almon misinterpreted the meaning of the cartoon and he had no intention of apologising.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not my practice to apologise to anyone who apparently does not understand cartooning. I think that the cartoon hopefully will serve a purpose of helping to focus on the question of the death penalty and the appropriateness of using it.&quot;</p>
<p>Benson said he will debate the cartoon with Almon on the NBC &quot;Today&quot; show on Friday morning.</p>
<p>A senior editor at The Arizona Republic defended the newspaper's use of the cartoon, which made an editorial comment on capital punishment in the case against Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted of the bombing.</p>
<p>Paul Schatt, the newspaper's editorial page editor, said he has no regrets about publishing the cartoon.</p>
<p>The photograph that inspired the cartoon showed Baylee Almon's broken body cradled in the arms of fireman Chris Fields and it quickly came to symbolise the bombing tragedy at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>Benson, a Pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. But Schatt said the technique employed by Benson was not unusual for editorial cartoonists.</p>
<p>&quot;What he's done is take an extremely powerful image and used it for a different purpose,&quot; Schatt told Reuters.</p>
<p>The June 11 cartoon was published as jurors were weighing capital punishment for McVeigh. The jury subsequently decided on the death penalty.</p>
<p>An international firefighters group demanded an apology from Benson and United Features Syndicate, labeling the cartoon &quot;repulsive and shamefully insulting.&quot; Benson was a member of the syndicate.</p>
<p>In a sharply worded letter, the International Association of Fire Fighters said the cartoon made a mockery of the more than 3,000 firefighters who risked their lives searching in the rubble for the victims of the blast.</p>
<p>&quot;Your cartoonist has taken the image of heroism and tragedy and twisted it into something that is nothing short of obscene,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>Chris Fields, the firefighter depicted in the photograph, said of the cartoon in a statement, &quot;It is pitiful and absolutely terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating called it a &quot;tasteless cartoon&quot; and said it reopened the wounds of that day for those like the child's mother.</p>
<p>Schatt said the newspaper may run the cartoon again to accompany letters to the editor about it. &quot;The cartoon stands for itself,&quot; he said. &quot;You either love it or hate it and people are welcome to their opinions.&quot;</p>
