<headline>Philips puts PCB unit up for sale.</headline>
<dateline>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands 1997-03-27</dateline>

<p>Philips Electronics NV said on Thursday it would divest its Printed Circuit Board (PCB) group.</p>
<p>A Philips spokesman said the unit was not considered a core part of the Philips group.</p>
<p>Philips has been divesting non-core and underperforming businesses since late last year.  </p>
<p>PCB is a designer and maker of printed circuit boards for use in consumer electronics, telecommunications and automotive electronics with operations in Britain, Austria, France, India and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The group is part of Philips' Plastics and Metalware Factories (PMF) whose operations are also under review.</p>
<p>&quot;Philips' intention to sell its PCB group is part of a broader review of the strategic alternatives for its PMF unit,&quot; the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>PCB employs 1,160 people in Europe and 150 in India. In 1996 it had sales of more than 300 million guilders, of which Philips accounted for 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Although confident of the further successful growth of the PCB group, Philips believes that its future is best served by having investors who are dedicated to the industry,&quot; Philips said.</p>
<p>It added it hoped to complete the divestment within the coming six months and said it had retained Credit Suisse First Boston to assist in the sale of PCB and the review of PMF.  </p>
<p>PMF in in 1996 had sales of over 800 million guilders and employed 3,900 people.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to reduce our involvement in PMF as well but how we do that we cannot say at the moment,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Philips' new chairman Cor Boonstra vowed late last year to tackle the company's underperformers and since then the firm has restructured its head office and hived off businesses involved in cable TV, video rental and home entertainments.</p>
