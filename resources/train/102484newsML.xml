<p>Good earnings growth relative to other regional markets is seen continuing to boost Hong Kong stocks, but analysts and brokers said on Tuesday consolidation for the Hang Seng index around 12,000 points would be healthy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that we will see quite a profitable Chinese New Year rally (January-February 1997), but in the meantime the market looks overbought,&quot; said Carlton Poon, director and head of Hong Kong research at Worldsec International Ltd.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index started its current rally in early August at around 10,600 points, rising to around 11,400 before undergoing a short consolidation at the end of that month.</p>
<p>The index then charged ahead on the back of record highs on Wall Street, breaking through the 11,600 level to set new 1996 highs at the end of September.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Hang Seng posted its biggest point gain in nearly seven months, rising 227.56 points to 12,133.07, just 68 points short of its record close of 12,201.09 set on January 4, 1994. The index fell 26.31 points to 12,106.76 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Short-term, the index looks toppy,&quot; said Alan Shum, research manager at New Century Securities. But he said the relative strength indicator is rising and would suggest an advance to 13,000 points on the Hang Seng index.</p>
<p>Most brokers said they were bullish on the short and medium-term outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still bullish on the market. If we don't see a pullback on Wall Street, it is possible to test 12,600 this month,&quot; said Ronald Lam, chief dealer at Dao Heng Securities.</p>
<p>The highest level the Hang Seng has ever reached is 12,599.23, the intra-day record high set on January 4, 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless there is some unexpected political development, the index should hit 13,000 by the end of the year,&quot; said Peter Lai, associate director of OCBC Securities.</p>
<p>However, analysts said they were more cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is likely to drift sideways in the near term,&quot; said Worldsec's Poon.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not chase prices, but accumulate issues with rotational buying, trying to anticipate the next sector that the bulk of the money is going to flow into, and I would stay in blue chips,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many of the market's blue chips are trading at fair value when viewed on a historical and prospective price/earnings basis, and some are looking a bit expensive, analysts said.</p>
<p>Earnings growth in 1996 will be mediocre, but calculated on a recurrent basis, growth should be much stronger in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Excluding all the exceptional gains in 1996 and those forecast for 1997, we are forecasting EPS (earnings per share) growth of 10 percent for the Hang Seng in 1996 and 17 percent for 1997,&quot; said Mark Simpson, head of Hong Kong research/strategy at ING Barings.</p>
<p>But analysts said Hong Kong looked good compared to other regional markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Various macroeconomic concerns have seen earnings forecasts for most regional markets rapidly whittled down over the past few months. Hong Kong (and Malaysia) stand out as safe havens in this sea of earnings downgrades,&quot; said Salomon Brothers' Deep Kapur in his Hong Kong Equity Strategy for September 1996.</p>
