<headline>Quiet emerging market debt see Russian risk soften.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-11</dateline>

<p>The emerging market debt market was subdued amid mild two-way trade on Friday after profit-taking on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market was also cautious ahead of U.S. producer price data due later and consumer price figures out on Wednesday. &quot;If the figures are benign, we might see it the market firm up again,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll forecast June PPI to remain unchanged from May levels at minus 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>Emerging market analysts said Russia was a bit softer. &quot;Mutterings about Vnesh is the rumour in the market,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Market talk was that there could be a delay in the Vnesheconombank (VEB) rescheduling of debt to the year-end from around October.</p>
<p>Recently Vneshekonombank chairman Andrei Kostin said Russia expected to close agreement with the London Club of commercial bank creditors in the autumn.</p>
<p>&quot;The Vnesh cash bond is probably the hardest hit.&quot;</p>
<p>At 1115 GMT,  Russian VN US$   was bid at</p>
<p>93.375.</p>
<p>Russian Minfin 3  was bid at  90.75,  Minfin 4 at 68.50, Minfin 5  at 50.75, Minfin 6 at 56.625 and Minfin 7  at 44.25.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cs  bonds were trading little changed from Thursday at around 83.50 and the country's global bond due 2027  at 99.50.</p>
<p>They said Argentina could be boosted by the 750 billion lire 10-year bond launched Friday to yield 156 basis points over the Italian swap rate.</p>
<p>&quot;Any new money that Argentina raises with long duration on it serves to take Argentina away from the treadmill of short-term debt service,&quot; a dealer said. -- Hayley Pienaar, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7718</p>
