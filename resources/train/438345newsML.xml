<p>Indonesian President Suharto on Wednesday urged business leaders from Asia, Europe and North America to seize the advantages of the explosive growth forecast for Southeast Asia over the next decades.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) will become one of the regions with the highest economic growth in the world in the decades to come,&quot; Suharto said in opening the first ASEAN Business summit.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result, a synergy is necessary -- whether between the government and businessmen, amongst ASEAN businessmen themselves and between ASEAN and non-ASEAN businessmen,&quot; he said. &quot;This is achieved .. by seizing opportunities within ASEAN and even outside ASEAN.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 600 business leaders from 30 countries, including about 200 from the United States, are attending the two-day summit in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Participants have said that with the adoption of an ASEAN Free Trade Area by 2003 and liberalisation of trade between Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries by 2020, the region should record explosive growth in the early part of the 21st century.</p>
<p>They have said Southeast Asia should have one billion consumers and $2.0 trillion in combined gross domestic product by 2020, up from the current 400 million and about $600 billion respectively.</p>
<p>ASEAN comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei. Cambodia, Laos and Burma are expected to join the bloc this year.</p>
<p>&quot;ASEAN is going to be important in the future,&quot; said meeting participant Richard Childress, who heads the Washington-based Asian Investment Strategies consultancy.</p>
<p>&quot;There are going to be a lot of private contacts and networking, but more importantly, we have come with a collective message: 'We take the place very seriously',&quot; he added, referring to the size of the U.S. business delegation attending the meeting.</p>
<p>Other participants said the delegation was the largest collection of businessmen from the United States to visit Indonesia.</p>
<p>Suharto told the gathering that ASEAN's location and abundant economic resources made it a strategic production base.</p>
<p>&quot;The increasingly rapid (economic) liberalisation process will simultaneously offer new market opportunities and new challenges,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope ASEAN businessmen can develop new initiatives for the promotion of small and medium enterprises which have great potential for the creation of employment opportunities...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Suharto called for a reliable partnership between business and government and &quot;a common ASEAN vision&quot; to lead the region towards its goals of economic liberalisation and free trade over the next couple of decades.</p>
