<p>HONOLULU, Oct 6 (REUTER) - As the banking industry heads for a year of record profits, regulators are looking at ways to loosen restrictions but they say ultimately Congress holds the key to modernising the system by revamping outdated laws.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has proposed raising the limit on the amount of securities underwriting that a bank's securities unit, known as a &quot;section 20&quot; subsidiary, can conduct in areas such as stocks and corporate bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;Most recently, based on our favourable experience with these subsidiaries, we have proposed dismantling some of the limitations and restrictions that, in an abundance of caution, we originally imposed to constrain risk exposures of the insured bank affiliate,&quot; Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in a speech to the American Bankers Association convention this weekend.</p>
<p>Steps that regulators can take, however, are &quot;constrained by outdated and increasingly inefficient statutes,&quot; Greenspan said Saturday.</p>
<p>Attempts in Congress to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separates investment and commercial banking, have fallen through for decades and the next Congress is expected to try again.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamental congressional reform of the Glass-Steagall and the Bank Holding Company Acts is still needed,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
<p>Repeal of Glass-Steagall is a key issue for the banking industry, Walter Dods, the new president of the American Bankers Association, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Consumers today want to go to one place and get all of their financial work done -- a financial supermarket approach,&quot; he said. &quot;And unless we can compete, we're going to continue to lose share of market, Dods added.</p>
<p>&quot;The banking industry has lost share of market over the last 10 or 20 years ... and the major reason for it is we don't have the legal ability to offer all the products that consumers want,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the industry is headed for a year of record profits, with few pitfalls in sight as long as the economy continues to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;If the commercial banking industry maintains the earnings strength it displayed during the first half of 1996, it will earn more than $50 billion in one year -- an annual record,&quot; Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Ricki Helfer said.</p>
<p>If the economy remains strong, industry profitability next year could end up in the same &quot;ballpark,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>One area regulators are monitoring closely is the rise in losses on credit card debt and personal bankruptcies, which are expected to exceed one million this year for the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;If the charge-off rate (on credit card loans) continues, and if the personal bankruptcy rate goes higher, then we may be more concerned. At the moment it's simply an area to watch and to monitor,&quot; Helfer said.</p>
<p>Another bank regulator, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig, said his office is looking again at pending proposals aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken those plans off the shelf, dusted them off, and reexamined them,&quot; he said. &quot;And I'm confident that decisions will be made on those plans within the next few weeks,&quot; Ludwig added.</p>
<p>William Grant, director of banking relations at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, later told reporters Ludwig was referring to proposals related to bank insurance sales and the activities permitted banks through operating subsidiaries.</p>
<p>While bankers see competition as worrisome, overall it is a positive force, Greenspan said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because the hot hand of competition is always putting pressure on us, we in our darker moments wish it would just go away,&quot; the Fed chairman said. &quot;I very often succumbed to such melancholy when I was in the private sector. But we are wrong,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Competition is the force which keeps us on our toes, makes us better and more productive,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
