<p>Controlling owners of sporting goods group Amer-yhtyma Oy said on Friday they are bound by an agreement with British investor Jonathan Bryan Guinness to not negotiate with others on a possible sale of their K-shares.</p>
<p>Four associations, which hold 90.5 percent of Amer's votes mainly through the K shares, agreed on June 2 to sell 1.1 million K shares to Guinness, third Lord Moyne, for 301 million markka.</p>
<p>This was rivalled on Thursday by Finnish investment company Norvestia, which said it was interested in bidding for part of the K shares at mainly the same terms as Guinness.</p>
<p>&quot;According to our agreement (with Guinness), we will not negotiate with anyone else,&quot; Leea Murtolehto, chairman of the Finnish Association of Graduates in Economics and Business Administration (SEFE), told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The Finnish Association of Graduate Engineers, the Student Union of the Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration, SEFE and The Land and Water Foundation -- together own 1.99 million K shares. SEFE owns 25 percent of this.</p>
<p>Heikki Kauppi, secretary general of the engineers' association which ows 34 percent of K shares, said Norvestia could not do anything to sweeten the offer.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if incomprehensible amounts of money had been offered, we would not be in a position to consider it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The agreement with Moyne involves lifting the listed A shares' voting power to 43 percent from only 10 percent currently, which would leave Guinness with 58 percent of votes and 4.6 percent of shares.</p>
<p>The four associations also own 748,835 listed A shares, giving them 11.5 percent of Amer's capital.</p>
<p>In all, the listed A shares represent 92 percent of capital, and they have preferential dividend rights.</p>
<p>Norvestia said its interest in making an offer would require that Amer used its right to redeem K shares, and this decision would be made by Amer's supervisory board.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to act (on the supervisory board) so that no redemption will happen,&quot; Murtolehto said.</p>
