<headline>French conscript held over rape of policewoman.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French judge on Friday remanded a 19-year-old conscript in custody on suspicion of raping and slashing a policewoman in mid-afternoon on a Paris commuter train, justice sources said.</p>
<p>The unnamed youth, who denies the charges, was formally placed under investigation on suspicion of gang rape and torture.</p>
<p>The sources said the policewoman identified him as one of five men who attacked her on her way home last October when she was off-duty, unarmed and out of uniform.</p>
<p>The men approached her in a deserted carriage of a regional express train in a suburb south of Paris. She said that when they opened her bag and saw she was a police officer, they attacked her with a linoleum cutter, cutting her face and hands before raping her.</p>
<p>She was found unconscious in her apartment four days later when her family became worried after not hearing from her.</p>
