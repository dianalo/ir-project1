<headline>Euro oil swaps fall, CFDs dip 5 cts, products dip.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps eased across the barrel on Thursday but activity remained thin.</p>
<p>Brent crude CFDs slipped five cents a barrel after widely differing prices traded on wet Brent.</p>
<p>Next week's dates traded a couple of times at 33 cents under June after wet Brent traded at both 25 and 37 cents under.</p>
<p>The following three weeks were pegged at 32 cents, 23 and 32 cents respectively.</p>
<p>Monthly CFDs remained in contango with May and June valued around 30 cents under front line IPE Brent and 23 cents under respectively.</p>
<p>The third and fourth quarters were 14 cents and 12 cents under respectively with the whole of 1998 talking either side of five cents under the screen.</p>
<p>May fuel barges slipped $1 a tonne to $83 with low sulphur around $3.50 higher but activity was thin. June barges stayed about 75 cents higher with low sulphur some $5 higher.</p>
<p>Some dealers expected prices to stay under pressure due to recent high refinery runs and expectations of higher Russian exports. The spring thaw in Russia has unlocked frozen rivers and fuel has begun flowing from the key outlet of St Petersburg.</p>
<p>Gasoline also fell $1 a tonne with May slipped to $198 after Rotterdam barges traded down to $196.</p>
<p>June stayed around $195.50 with crack spreads also little changed. May talked $5.25 a barrel while the third and fourth qaurters talked $4.10 and $3.10 respectively.</p>
<p>Middle distillates were little changed. Gas oil crack spreads against Brent talked $4.30 a barrel (3Q97), $4.85 (4Q97), $4.75 (1Q98), $4.10 (2Q98).</p>
<p>Swaps for physical gas oil cargoes slipped 50 cents to $5.50 a tonne and $14.25 over the IPE for May 0.2 and EN590 respectively.</p>
<p>Jet premiums above the IPE also eased. May was pegged around $23 a tonne over while June was $24.50 over.</p>
