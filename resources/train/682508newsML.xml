<headline>Sudan denies bid to kill Eritrea's Afewerki.</headline>
<dateline>KHARTOUM 1997-06-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Sudanese government denied on Tuesday it tried to kill Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki.</p>
<p>Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae told a news conference on Monday in the Eritrean capital Asmara that Sudan plotted to kill Afewerki last November through an agent he named as Captain Nesredin Babakar Aba Al Khairat.</p>
<p>&quot;After checking the list of officers in the (Sudanese) armed forces and other regular forces, no name, as alleged, of Nasredin Babakar Aba Al Khairat has been found,&quot; the official Sudan News Agency quoted Mustafa Osman Ismail, a minister at the foreign ministry, as saying.</p>
<p>Ismail described the Eritrean allegation as &quot;mere fabrications, (through) which the Eritrean regime seeks to absolve itself of the involvement of its organs in recent subversive attempts detected by the Sudanese authorities&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The fabricated Eritrean statement coincides with the plot of the Eritrean regime, supported by foreign forces, to attack Sudan,&quot; Ismail said.</p>
<p>He was referring to jail sentences passed earlier this month on 19 people for planning to attack vital installations in Port Sudan in a bid to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Ismail challenged the Asmara government to try the alleged Sudanese officer in public.</p>
<p>Khartoum has accused Asmara of helping the Sudanese rebels who launched an offensive from close to the Eritrean border in January. Eritrea denies the charge.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Haile said Khartoum had planned to carry out the assassination through an agent it had infiltrated into the ranks of the exiled National Democratic Alliance (NDA) of Sudan.</p>
<p>The Asmara-based NDA is made up of Sudanese rebel groups in exile fighting to overthrow the government in Khartoum.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NDA &quot;foreign secretary,&quot; Mansour Khalid, denounced the plot and gave more details on how it was to be executed.</p>
<p>&quot;The NDA denounces the plot by the NIF (Sudan government) to assassinate President Isaias Afewerki,&quot; Mansour said.</p>
<p>An Eritrean government statement said the would-be-assassin, currently being held by NDA security, left Khartoum in November last year to infiltrate the NDA in Asmara and had been given until April this year to carry out the assassination of Isaias.</p>
<p>At the news conference on Monday Haile directly accused Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and spiritual leader Hassan al-Turabi of authorising the operation.</p>
<p>&quot;This heinous crime was conceived at the highest levels of the NIF regime, with explicit orders given to the terrorist from senior government officials including Turabi and General Omar Al-Bashir, head of state,&quot; said Haile.</p>
<p>Haile said Eritrea would file a complaint with the United Nations.</p>
<p>Some countries in the region, backed by the United States, accuse Khartoum of harbouring radical Islamic groups who export their brand of revolution.</p>
<p>Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan have been strained after Ethiopia accused Khartoum of sponsoring three gunmen involved in a June 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.</p>
