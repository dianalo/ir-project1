<p>South African Sports Minister Steve Tshwete on Tuesday accused rugby union chief Louis Luyt of lacking sensitivity towards a failed black challenge for control of the Transvaal Rugby Union (TRU).</p>
<p>&quot;I am not happy and I know that many people are not happy,&quot; Tshwete told reporters in Cape Town.</p>
<p>&quot;If we fail to reconcile the black and white contingents in the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) then rugby has no business here.&quot;</p>
<p>Tshwete, who taught rugby to his cellmates in the Robben Island political prison under apartheid, was reacting to reports that Luyt had ridiculed black rugby official Brian van Rooyen who made a failed bid to unseat him as president of the TRU on Monday.</p>
<p>Newspapers on Tuesday said Luyt called van Rooyen a fool and castigated his own committee for failing to challenge van Rooyen's accusation that they were Luyt puppets.</p>
<p>The incident was the latest chapter in Luyt's controversial management of the sport which was virtually a religion to South Africa's Afrikaner rulers under apartheid.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a society in transition and a society that has been divided on racial lines and even violently,&quot; Tshwete said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are going to be problems in South African sport and some of those problems are going to centre around personalities with different backgrounds, like right now in rugby.&quot;</p>
<p>He said many people would interpret Luyt's outburst as a racial slur.</p>
<p>&quot;In rugby in particular, given the history of the sport in this country, you should be more sensitive. The president of SARFU should be more sensitive in handling issues of this kind,&quot; Tshwete said.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be more patient, more understanding, more considerate than any other code. It is high time that rugby stopped making these negative headlines.&quot;</p>
