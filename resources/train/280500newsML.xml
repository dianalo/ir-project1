<p>Tokyo shares limped to a weak finish for 1996 on Monday while most other Asian stock markets ended higher in holiday-subdued trading.</p>
<p>Dealers said Friday's record close by Wall Street had encouraged some Asian investors.</p>
<p>But for Japanese shares on the last trading day of the year it was a subdued ending to a year which has seen the benchmark veering from a peak of 22,666.80 in the summer to a trough of 19,161.71 on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended Monday's half-day session at 19,361.35, down 7.69 points or 0.04 percent from the previous session, and around 500 below its 1995 close.</p>
<p>The uncertain outlook for the Japanese economy and sinking stocks have strengthened the view that Tokyo will have to keep its interest rates low to bolster the economy, sending investors flocking to the higher yielding dollar.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 76.61 points to close at 13,480.75.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was dominated today by trading in just a few blue chips,&quot; said Peter Lai, associate director at OCBC Securities.</p>
<p>Taiwan share prices closed slightly higher on year-end window-dressing by local securities trust funds, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended up 22.37 points or 0.32 percent at 6,926.27.</p>
<p>A thinly traded Australian share market climbed to a record close as the All Ordinaries index rose 17.3 points to finish at 2,412.9, surpassing the previous high of 2,408.9 which was set on November 26.</p>
<p>Singapore shares got a boost from Wall Street to close higher, dealers said. The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index ended 15.85 points up at 2,218.45.</p>
<p>In New York on Friday the Dow Jones Industrial Index rose 14 to close at a record 6561.</p>
<p>Malaysian share prices finished higher, with small-capitalised issues taking the lead on renewed retail interest. The Composite Index of blue chips rose 5.69 points to 1,214.69, a 0.47 percent gain.</p>
<p>Thai stocks fell on the last trading day of the year. The SET index dropped 4.14 points to end at 831.57 on 4.7 billion baht turnover. The SET fell 35.07 percent since the beginning of 1996 and closed at its lowest level since June 7, 1993, when the index finished at 827.14.</p>
<p>The Seoul, Jakarta and Manila exchanges were among those closed for holidays.</p>
<p>At 1115 GMT the dollar was trading at 115.94/6.04 yen and 1.5554/61 marks.</p>
<p>Gold bullion in Hong Kong ended at US$369.40/90 an ounce against New York's US$369.30/369.60 close on Friday.</p>
<p>Crude oil futures were firmer in Asia. February Brent traded late in the session at $23.60 per barrel, up 18 cents from London's settlement on Friday of $23.42. Just 25 lots changed hands.</p>
