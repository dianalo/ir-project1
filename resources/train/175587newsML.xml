<p>A future Labour government would face a legal and political minefield if it tried to fulfil a central tax-raising pledge if it won the next general election, stock market analysts warned on Friday.</p>
<p>Financial markets are already assuming a Labour Party administration would attempt attempt to raise about five billion pounds ($8.24 billion) through a tax on the so-called &quot;windfall profits&quot; made by privatised utility companies.</p>
<p>But Philip Hollobone, utilities analyst at brokers Williams de Broe, said: &quot;There are increasing doubts as to whether this thing will be legal.&quot;</p>
<p>He said under European Union law, there can be no discrimination between different industrial sectors.</p>
<p>Labour economics spokesman Gordon Brown has promised to make the windfall tax the centrepiece of his first budget if the current Conservative government is ousted in elections due by next May. Polls giving it a lead of around 20 points have made it favourite to form the next government.</p>
<p>Labour says it would use the funds to tackle youth unemployment and provide the jobless with training programmes. This would help to cut public spending by trimming dole queues.</p>
<p>Brown has never publicly said how much money the tax would raise, but an aide on Thursday told the Daily Telegraph that five billion pounds was &quot;at the conservative end of the spectrum&quot;.</p>
<p>No one in Brown's office was available to comment on Friday.</p>
<p>Merchant bankers SBC Warburg said in a recent note to clients that a tax of around five billion pounds was &quot;already broadly discounted&quot; by the market.</p>
<p>The report said up to 30 water, electricity, gas and telecoms companies privatised since the Conservatives came to power in 1979 could be hit, but they had the resources to pay the tax.</p>
<p>The report said British Telecom, which this week announced plans for a $20 billion merger with U.S. firm MCI Communications, could &quot;comfortably&quot; afford a 1.0 to 1.4 billion pound payment.</p>
<p>Asked about Warburg's five billion pound figure, Nigel Hawkins of brokers Yamaichi International said: &quot;Very broadly, I would think the market would be expecting that sort of figure.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said the market was guessing since Brown had never answered questions on how much he planned to raise, which companies would come within the scope of the tax and how their liabilities would be calculated.</p>
<p>But another broker, speaking anonymously, said: &quot;I would not say that the market in general has discounted any figure. It is such a moving-goalpost scenario.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Brown would have problems meeting the requirement under EU law that &quot;a tax has to be seen to be equitable&quot;.</p>
<p>Brokers said it would be difficult for Brown to define what a privatised utility was, and to establish a fair formula for calculating &quot;excess profits&quot;, given that the ways privatised companies were regulated varied greatly.</p>
<p>Ed Wallis, chairman of electricity generator PowerGen, said this week he thought his firm would escape the tax because it was in a fully competitive market.</p>
<p>But analysts said other firms would claim exemption on the grounds that they had been already forced by industry regulators to cut their prices drastically in real terms.</p>
<p>The political battle on the tax is hotting up, with the Conservatives calling a parliamentary debate on it for November 21 and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke on Thursday demanding Labour spell out its plans.</p>
<p>The Conservatives say the tax will deprive companies of investment capital, force up the interest rates at which they can borrow and therefore impact on prices to consumers.</p>
