<p>Unidentified gunmen murdered eight members of a refugee family in an attack in northwest Colombia on Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>The massacre took place near the town of San Pelayo in Cordoba province. The family recently arrived in the area after fleeing the conflict between leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary groups and the army in the nearby, violence-torn Uraba region.</p>
<p>&quot;Any massacre is savage and unforgivable. We are very surprised because it's been years since we have seen this type of action here,&quot; said Cordoba Governor Carlos Buelvas.</p>
<p>The killings came the day after eight other peasants were slain by a suspected right-wing death squad in northern Cesar province.</p>
<p>Cordoba is the birthplace of the so-called Peasant Self- Defence group of Cordoba and Uraba (ACCU), the country's most- feared paramilitary gang which was set up to fight leftist guerrillas and suspected rebel sympathisers.</p>
<p>A regional police spokesman said two minors were among the dead, adding that early information suggested an illegal armed group had tracked the refugee family from Uraba into Cordoba. He declined to say whether he thought guerrillas or paramilitary units were responsible for the killings.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, local government officials and military commanders have accused leftist guerrillas of forcing peasants to flee their homes in order to create social problems in major towns.</p>
