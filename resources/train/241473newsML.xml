<title>FRANCE: Elf refinery strikers to vote on offer.</title>
<headline>Elf refinery strikers to vote on offer.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-06</dateline>

<p>Striking Elf Aquitaine workers will vote from 1300 GMT on Friday on whether to end a stoppage at the oil giant's French refineries after Elf made offers on pay and conditions on Thursday, union officials said.</p>
<p>Union officials have bitterly rejected Elf's offer as irrelevant to the strike which was sparked by plans to cut 10 percent of Elf's French refining staff.</p>
<p>But while some strikers vowed to keep up the action, others were said to be growing weary on day nine of the strike.</p>
<p>&quot;They are very disappointed but they are getting fed up,&quot; said one union official at the Grandpuits plant near Paris.  </p>
<p>But a union official at the larger Feyzin refinery near Lyon said the mood among the strikers there was still determined.</p>
<p>&quot;The way things are going does not satisfy us at all,&quot; the official from the CFDT union said. &quot;We don't give a damn about salaries. That was not why we have had nine days of strike,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Unions said that strikers said strikers would vote between 1300 GMT and 1500 GMT at Feyzin and at 1300 GMT at the Grandpuits and Donges refineries.  </p>
<p>The union official at Feyzin said that salaries were to have been negotiated on December 20 and were not the issue in the current strike.</p>
<p>&quot;The people here are very motivated to protect jobs. They have friends who are on the dole,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Union officials said on Thursday that Elf had offered to raise pay by 1.5 percent from July next year but had refused to withdraw a plan to cut 330 jobs.</p>
<p>Elf has not said what offer it made.</p>
