<title>UK: NatWest sees pronounced post-election UK rate rise.</title>

<p>NatWest Group chief economist David Kern said pronounced increases in official interest rates would be necessary after Britain's general election, due by May.</p>
<p>&quot;As output continues to expand at a rate above its long-term trend, there is increased likelihood that underlying RPI inflation will remain above 2.5 percent,&quot; he said, referring to the government's medium-term inflation target.</p>
<p>&quot;Pronounced base rate rises will be required after the general election to dampen accelerating demand and stronger inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>He sees official rates rising fairly sharply from the present 6.0 percent from May onwards, peaking at 7.25 percent by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Base rates should fall back again to 6.75 percent by the end of 1998 as the economy slows, Kern said.</p>
<p>The strong pound would probably enable Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to keep rates unchanged until the election.</p>
<p>&quot;But strong unemployment falls and higher earnings growth point to a tightening labour market and these pressures will increase later in the year,&quot; Kern wrote in NatWest's latest Economic and Financial Outlook.</p>
