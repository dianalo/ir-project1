<p>South Korean state prosecutors on Thursday summoned the founder of the Hanbo Group from a hospital for questioning in a loan-scandal case rocking the nation.</p>
<p>Chung Tae-soo, wearing a dark coat and white muffler, was later escorted by investigators from a Seoul hospital to the prosecution office, a prosecution official said.</p>
<p>Chung, who contributed to the coffers of now-jailed former president Roh Tae-woo, had been admitted to hospital after complaining of high blood pressure on Tuesday but doctors said his health was relatively sound.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Chung, famous for his lobbying skills and extravagant spending habits, would be questioned over how he secured billions of dollars in loans to finance a massive new plant for Hanbo Steel, flagship of the Hanbo Group.</p>
<p>Hanbo Steel, the country's second-largest steelmaker, earlier this week filed for court protection from creditors after piling up five trillion won ($5.8 billion) in loans. It defaulted on debt repayments last week.</p>
<p>Chung acquired or set up 18 companies in the past three years to make the Hanbo Group South Korea's 14th-largest conglomerate, or chaebol, with 22 units.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, calling the loans the biggest financial scandal in the country's history, have accused the government of pressuring creditor banks to offer loans to Hanbo without adequate collateral.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam on Monday ordered a probe into the Hanbo scandal, which has tainted his anti-corruption drive ahead of presidential elections in December.</p>
<p>Kim came to power in 1993 on an anti-graft platform and gave top priority to severing the corrupt alliance betweeen politics and business, which he described as the worst legacy of the military-backed rule of his strong-man predecessors.</p>
<p>Scores of prosecutors at the Central Investigation Department have been assigned to the probe, which has progressed rapidly since Kim's order, prosecutor Choi Byung-koog said.</p>
<p>The prosecutors, who have already questioned Chung's top aides and officials of some creditor banks, will try to find out whether there were kickbacks involved in the loans to Hanbo, he said.</p>
<p>Four out of five South Korean bankers said they believed there was &quot;outside pressure&quot; on Hanbo's creditors, according to a survey carried out by the Maeil Business Newspaper.</p>
<p>More than half of 138 bank executives surveyed by the daily said the loan scandal stemmed largely from the government's heavy influence in making credit decisions by banks.</p>
<p>Others blamed Hanbo's reckless expansion plans.</p>
<p>The state banking watchdog on Wednesday opened a special probe into the main creditor banks of Hanbo Steel -- Korea First Bank, Cho Hung Bank, Korea Exchange Bank, SEOULBANK and the state-run Korea Development Bank.</p>
<p>The Office of Bank Supervision said the probe into the five banks would focus on whether they violated regulations in offering loans to Hanbo.</p>
<p>It is the third time Chung has faced a prosecution probe.</p>
<p>He was convicted of bribery in a multi-million dollar housing scandal involving Hanbo's construction unit in 1991.</p>
<p>Chung paid 15 billion won into a slush fund raised by Roh, now serving a 17-year jail term for corruption and human rights abuses. But a Seoul court trying Chung and Roh acquitted Chung on the grounds the money was forcibly extracted. ($=859 won)</p>
