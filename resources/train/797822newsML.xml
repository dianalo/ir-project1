<p>British airports operator BAA Plc said on Wednesday its seven UK airports handled 10.2 million passengers in July, an increase of six percent on the same month last year.</p>
<p>This is the highest number of passengers ever recorded in a single month and the first time BAA has handled more than 100 million passengers in a 12 month period, said the group in a statement.</p>
<p>Despite the British Airways strike, every airport and all of the major markets recorded increases.</p>
<p>BAA estimated the net loss in passenger numbers due to the BA strike at about 200,000, equal to two percent of the month's traffic.  </p>
<p>The European charter market was the fastest growing sector with an increase of 12.3 percent in passengers during July. Long haul routes saw passenger numbers rise 8.5 percent, Eire traffic 6.4 percent and North Atlantic routes 6.3 percent.</p>
<p>The markets most affected by the strike were the European scheduled and domestic routes with increases of 3.9 percent and 2.8 percent, said BAA Plc .</p>
<p>Gatwick, Stansted and Glasgow airports all recorded increases of 12.4 percent, 11.9 percent and 12.6 percent while Southampton showed an 18 percent increase.</p>
<p>Even Heathrow, where the effects of the strike were the greatest, had its busiest ever month, and increased by 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>As a result of the strike, the total number of air transport movements rose by only two percent, but the volume of air cargo tonnage was unaffected, with an increase of 7.1 percent, said BAA Plc.</p>
