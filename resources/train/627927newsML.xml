<p>Quiet trading ushered Shenzhen's B share index to a slightly higher close on Friday, with investors fearing sharp rises could provoke new government anti-speculation measures, brokers said.</p>
<p>The foreign currency B index added 1.92 points or 1.27 percent to 153.07. Turnover shrank to HK$61.2 million from an already thin HK$67.6 million on Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The markets have been so volatile lately and no one wants to bet on the government's next move,&quot; a trader at China Southern Securities said.</p>
<p>Beijing's measures to cool the markets at the start of May and rumours of further moves sent A and B share indices into a tailspin. Before the crackdown, they had surged more than 50 percent from the beginning of 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;Unless the government comes out with hard-hitting measures over the weekend, Monday is not going to be very exciting either,&quot; an analyst at a foreign investment bank said.</p>
<p>The A share index gained 10.57 points or 2.44 percent to 443.91 on light turnover of 5.4 billion yuan, against Thursday's 5.7 billion.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Tellus Machinery &amp; Electronics Co Ltd was the top gainer in the B share market, rising HK$0.16 or 5.82 percent to HK$2.91.  </p>
<p>Among the A shares, Shenzhen Development Bank, which has been under investigation for stock trading misconduct, was the most actively traded at 38.5 million shares. The stock gained 0.59 yuan to 33.64 yuan.</p>
<p>Several Hong Kong newspapers have reported rumours that there may be top personnel changes at the bank because of the probe.</p>
<p>Bank officials declined to comment.</p>
