<p>Police in the oil-producing state of Rivers in southeastern Nigeria have banned demonstrations to mark the first anniversary on Sunday of the hanging of rights activist and author Ken Saro-Wiwa, newspapers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Movement for the Survival of Ogoni Peoples (MOSOP), of which Saro-Wiwa was national president when he and eight MOSOP activists were hanged, said separately there would be no mass rallies in order to avoid a clash with security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;The remembrance will be observed quietly...there is absolutely no cause for celebration or crowded observation in the face of glaring threats,&quot; a MOSOP statement said.</p>
<p>Rivers state police commissioner Muktar Alkali told a news conference in the state capital Port Harcourt he had received information of plans to disturb the peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The police command hereby warns that it will not hesitate to deal ruthlessly with anyone caught organising or participating in such illegal acts,&quot; he was quoted by the independent Guardian newspaper as saying.</p>
<p>Ogoniland is troubled by attempts to establish self-determination for the 500,000-strong community which MOSOP championed under Saro-Wiwa's leadership.</p>
<p>Nigeria caused international outrage last November 10 when Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP activists were hanged for the murder of four Ogoni chiefs.</p>
<p>The activists had been tried under a military decree condemned worldwide as unfair. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth and various sanctions imposed on it by mainly Western nations.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the anniversary of the hangings, MOSOP alleged there had been a renewed crackdown on the Ogoni people by security forces. The charge was denied by the authorities.</p>
