<title>UK: London gold firmer, but downside may still beckon.</title>

<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-04</dateline>

<p>Precious metals were modestly firmer in early trading on Monday, but dealers said the market was still predominantly bearish after last week's dive.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $378.65 an ounce, compared with $377.60 on Friday afternoon, after prices bounced from recent lows overnight. Prices had sunk about $5.00 last week on selling attributed to gold miners, a central bank and speculators.</p>
<p>A fresh test of recent lows just under $377 was possible in the near term, dealers said.</p>
<p>But some said that with most of the market expecting prices to head lower, an upturn seemed more likely.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems a bit of a bear trap, we may have seen the low for the moment,&quot; one said. &quot;We may see a bit of consolidation, a bit of buying now,&quot; he added, pegging the near term maximum at the important $380.00 level.</p>
<p>Price charts showed gold twice at $376.80 recently. Analysts said this suggested a &quot;double bottom&quot; formation had formed, providing support for gold at that level.</p>
<p>But both the 10- and 30-day moving averages were moving lower, which indicated gold's downward movement had accelerated.</p>
<p>The market may pick up following the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We may some more life after the (U.S. presidential) elections, although what Clinton has to do with gold is a mystery,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He also noted that the pattern set over many months of prices declining after option expiries appeared to have changed.</p>
<p>There was no perceptible fall after the expiry last week of over-the-counter options, which provide the right but not the obligation to buy or sell metal at a give price.</p>
<p>&quot;The option writers' strategy seems to have changed. It is not very profitable to write gold options on the basis of a volatility of 4.5-5.00 percent. The situation is a lot less clear cut now than it was,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Silver prices were firmer with gold, up four cents from Friday's London close at $4.81/$4.83.</p>
<p>Platinum was up $1.00 at $380.50/$381.50 after dropping below the $380 an ounce support level last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Silver and platinum have been holding quite well, and they are going to be key,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;If silver gets below $4.74 and platinum goes below $380 it's not going to look good for any of the precious metals.&quot;</p>
<p>Palladium was unchanged at $115.75/$116.75. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
