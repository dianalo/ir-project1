<title>USA: 3-D Geophysical sees loss, needs financing.</title>
<headline>3-D Geophysical sees loss, needs financing.</headline>
<dateline>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>3-D Geophysical Inc said Tuesday it expects sharply disappointing second quarter results and needs additional working capital in order to fill its order backlog.  </p>
<p>3-D said it expects a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.20 a share in the second quarter, sharply below Wall Street analysts' estimates of nil, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Because of the second quarter shortfall, fiscal 1997 net income will be substantially below analysts' estimates of about $0.37, the company said.</p>
<p>3-D said its results were hit by several factors: bad weather, which delayed starting projects in the United States and Canada; surprisingly high costs in work in Alaska.  </p>
<p>It also said that it discovered archaeological ruins during the course of its work on a Mexican project, which meant delays, and slow work at the project.</p>
<p>3-D said it needs additional financing to complete its backlog, which was $48 million for projects in 1997 at June 1, 1997. Of that, $16 million is to be performed in the United States (other than Alaska), $14 million in Mexico, $11 million in Alaska, $4 million in Peru, and $3 million in Canada.</p>
<p>The company said it is in talks with banks for additional financing but has no commitment from any bank yet.  </p>
<p>&quot;An inability to secure additional financing will have an adverse effect on the company,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>3-D also said its Canadian JRS Exploration subsidiary won two new contracts -- a two-year contract worth at least US$4.3 million, and a pact with a Canadian Federal Government agency for US$1.1 million expected in September and October 1997.</p>
<p>The company also said it has halted its expansion plans for Latin America until operations become profitable in Mexico and Peru. It is relocating company controller John Hollister to Mexico City to upgrade financial systems, improve financial reporting and lower cost structure.</p>
<p>3-D will also continue to consolidate its U.S. functions into its Englewood, Colorado headquarters and will implement a a cost cutting program in the third quarter to cut fixed costs.</p>
