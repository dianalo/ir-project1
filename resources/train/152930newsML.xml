<p>Members of the ruling Conservative party put a brave face on Wednesday's surprise rise in interest rates, saying it showed the government's determination to manage the economy responsibly in the run-up to Britain's election.</p>
<p>Several Conservative members of parliament said Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's willingness to raise rates with an election at most six months away also strongly suggested he would present a cautious budget on November 26.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows the responsibility with which the government is treating the economy and is making sure that it is run for the benefit of the country and not for short-term political advantage,&quot; Matthew Carrington, chairman of parliament's Treasury Select Committee, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Politically, I don't think it's going to have a negative effect on us. Running the economy prudently and for the benefit of the country has some upside to it. I suspect not much, but it has some,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The rate rise, to six percent from 5.75 percent, was the first since February 1995, but the potential blow to the Conservatives was cushioned when Britain's leading mortgage lenders said they would not immediately raise home-loan rates.</p>
<p>David Shaw, vice-chairman of the Conservatives' backbench finance committee, said the increase sent a message to voters that Prime Minister John Major was not prepared to let the economy roar out of control for short-term electoral benefits.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see any political damage. I think in fact it tells the British public that we're prepared to take the tough and necessary decisions to maintain a stable, growing economy. That's the emphasis -- stability,&quot; Shaw told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shaw, a prominent right-winger who would like Clarke to cut the standard rate of income tax to 22 percent from 24 percent, said the unexpected tightening of monetary policy pointed to a cautious budget next month.</p>
<p>&quot;It tells us more that he's not going to give too much in tax reductions. But I think it still leaves us a certain degree of flexibility,&quot; Shaw said.</p>
<p>Carrington broadly agreed: &quot;What the interest rate rise shows is that his budget is going to be a cautious budget. It's not going to be an electioneering budget.&quot;</p>
<p>The main opposition parties sought to portray the rate rise as a sign of weakness, saying low investment meant the economy could not grow briskly without generating inflation.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown, Labour's economics spokesman, said it was &quot;the inevitable and necessary consequence of the government's failure to tackle the fundamental weaknesses in the British economy and secure the investment-based recovery which we need to secure lasting prosperity and prevent a return to stop-go economics&quot;.</p>
<p>Clarke, by contrast, said his decision was a tribute to the health of the economy -- and he added a warning to his political opponents as the election battle warms up.</p>
<p>&quot;We are on target to go into the spring with the worst possible situation for the Labour and Liberal parties -- growth, rising living standards, falling unemployment and low inflation which enables British business, British commerce to do well,&quot; Clarke told BBC television.</p>
<p>Clarke's judgment was endorsed by Quentin Davies, another Conservative member of the Treasury select committee.</p>
<p>&quot;This demonstrates that Kenneth Clarke in his conduct of fiscal and monetary policy is really impervious to short-term party-political considerations -- and that is absolutely right, and that is why he has the confidence of the markets,&quot; Davies told Reuters.</p>
