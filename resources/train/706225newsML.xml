<p>Austria's ATX index  .ATX of 21 blue chips surged to a record high for the fourth day running on Thursday, adding on 16.65 points, or 1.22 percent, to 1,381.4.</p>
<p>Among its constituents 13 shares rose and eight fell.</p>
<p>But traders said the peak may have been reached as trading volume was below Wednesday's levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The ATX may have reached its year high today. I think we're going to come gently down now,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders traced today's gains above all to engineering group VA Tech, which rose 5.36 percent to 2,520 schillings on turnover of nearly 47,000 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;The main reason for the rally was VA Tech strength,&quot; said another trader. &quot;Only when VA Tech rose the others were bought.&quot;</p>
<p>The ATX performance was relatively disappointing in early trade, when the German Dax was already making clear gains, he added.</p>
<p>The top gainer was beverage group BBAG, which jumped 6.88 percent to 823 schillings.</p>
<p>The leading decliner was fibre producer Lenzing, dropping 1.51 percent to 717 schillings.</p>
<p>The July ATX future climbed 18.6 points to 1,389.1 with 831 contracts traded.</p>
