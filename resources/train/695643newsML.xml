<headline>Ivorian exporters plan new coffee grading plant.</headline>

<p>Ivorian exporters plan to build a new coffee sorting and grading plant in Abidjan for 1997/98 (Oct-Sept) as part of an effort to deal with quality problems experienced in 1996/97, an exporters' spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it will be operational by the end of September,&quot; a director of the project's main partner, exporters' agent ACCACI, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be turning over at about 20,000 tonnes (of robusta beans) a year,&quot; ACCACI spokesman Laurent Dal Maso said.</p>
<p>He put Ivory Coast's total coffee sorting and grading capacity at 300,000 tonnes, equal to arrivals by July, but said that many plants had not been operating at full capacity after being run down in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Other exporters have also said they will renovate equipment for 1997/98.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast produced an unexpectedly large 1996/97 crop of around 300,000 tonnes (by end-June) against an official forecast of 230,000 tonnes. The 1995/96 harvest totalled 180,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much more to come in. You could say the season has finished as there is just black (damaged) beans and old stores coming in now,&quot; Dal Maso said, putting port arrivals at little more than 2,000 tonnes a week.</p>
<p>Exporters said they had struggled to grade large volumes of poor quality 1996/97 beans stemming from unselective harvesting by farmers, rain damage and poor storage.</p>
<p>ACCACI, along with the exporters it supplies, would benefit from tax exemptions on imports of factory equipment and contruction materials, the director said, adding that the plant would eventually employ around 30 people.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a problem of sorting and needed a way to speed up grading,&quot; Dal Maso said by telphone from San Pedro. The plan had been finalised over the past month, he added.</p>
