<p>Two dejected astronauts hung up their space suits on Friday after a jammed hatch forced the cancellation of a space walk aimed at testing space station construction techniques.</p>
<p>Astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Tom Jones intended to open the hatch leading to the shuttle's cargo bay at about 9:20 p.m. EST on Thursday (0220 GMT Friday), but were unable to fully turn the handle that unlatches the 40-inch (101 cm) diameter door.</p>
<p>&quot;The handle rotates about 30 degrees and then it doesn't seem to want to move,&quot; Jernigan said as she struggled with the hatch. The handle had to turn more than a full revolution to release the door's six latches.</p>
<p>After the astronauts had spent more than two hours wrestling with the balky mechanism, flight controllers at NASA's mission control in Houston cancelled the space walk.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to try to regroup here,&quot; spacecraft communicator Bill McArthur radioed from Houston. &quot;Go ahead and get Tammy and Tom out of their suits.&quot;</p>
<p>It was only the second time in the 15-year shuttle programme that NASA has been forced to cancel a space walk. The last occasion, in 1983, was because of space suit problems.</p>
<p>The two would-be space walkers and Columbia's three other astronauts tucked into the Thanksgiving meal they had not expected to eat until after the space walk.</p>
<p>&quot;Today didn't go exactly as we'd hoped,&quot; said shuttle commander Ken Cockrell, as his crew ate their NASA-issue, shelf-stabilised turkey steaks. &quot;We've got high hopes for tomorrow and the rest of this flight ... we still have a lot to be thankful for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just want to assure everyone that we're putting the first team on this,&quot; said McArthur. &quot;We're going to work hard and we're going to figure out this airlock hatch problem and get you guys out at the next opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>As the astronauts ate, engineers examined television views of the hatch mechanism, looking for signs of trouble.</p>
<p>NASA officials offered little hope of a finding a solution because most of the latching mechanism is located on the exterior of the hatch and cannot be reached by the crew.</p>
<p>&quot;We are rather limited in what we can do from inside the airlock,&quot; flight director Rob Kelso told a news conference early on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the gloomy outlook, mission control instructed the astronauts to go to bed an hour early so they could make an early start if the space walk was rescheduled for Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;One option would enable the astronauts to conduct their space walk as early as Friday should the hatch handle problem be corrected,&quot; mission control commentator Rob Navias explained. &quot;If it cannot be solved then the space walks will likely be cancelled for this mission.&quot;</p>
<p>Jernigan and Jones were to have practised assembly of the international space station, the first component of which is scheduled for launch in November 1997.</p>
<p>In a second spacewalk scheduled for Saturday night the astronauts were supposed to test a manually operated crane and other tools needed for the construction of the project.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel quite strongly that these are two very important (space walks) in the build up to ... going to build space station,&quot; said Jerry Ross, an astronaut assigned to the first space station assembly mission. &quot;I'm not prepared to say, however, if we didn't do these two (space walks) we wouldn't be ready to start.&quot;</p>
<p>Columbia, NASA's oldest space shuttle, is due to return to earth at the Kennedy Space Centre on Dec. 5.</p>
