<title>ITALY: Top Sicilian Mafia bosses tried for 1993 bombings.</title>
<headline>Top Sicilian Mafia bosses tried for 1993 bombings.</headline>
<dateline>FLORENCE, Italy 1996-11-12</dateline>

<p>Mafia bosses Salvatore Riina, Leoluca Bagarella and Giovanni Brusca went on trial on Tuesday for a string of bombings that rocked Rome, Florence and Milan in 1993, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>Mafia &quot;Godfather&quot; Riina and his brother-in-law Bagarella were among twelve of 28 defendents who were at Florence's Santa Verdiana courthouse for the trial's opening while Brusca did not attend, the sources said.</p>
<p>The three jailed bosses are suspected along with wanted mob leader Bernardo Provenzano of masterminding the bombings, which killed 10 people and damaged several cultural sites.</p>
<p>One wing of Florence's Uffizi Gallery has only recently reopened following the May 1993 car bomb attack which wrecked parts of its priceless Renaissance art collection.</p>
<p>Florentine magistrates have said they believe the Mafia carried out two blasts against Rome churches during the same campaign to punish Pope John Paul for a strong attack he made against the Mafia during a visit to Sicily the same year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police on Tuesday arrested four more suspects in the 1992 killing of leading anti-Mafia judge Paolo Borsellino and magistrates told 24 jailed Mafiosi they too were suspected.</p>
<p>The 24 included Riina, Brusca and top boss Benedetto &quot;Nitto&quot; Santapaola, who is also in prison.</p>
<p>Magistrates told a news conference in the Sicilian town of Caltanisetta the arrests and warrants were part of a probe into the car bomb killing of Borsellino and five bodyguards in July 1992.</p>
<p>Borsellino was killed two months after fellow anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone was blown up along with his wife and three bodyguards by a bomb planted under a highway outside the Sicilian capital, Palermo.</p>
<p>Brusca, one of the mob's most ferocious members, is also accused of setting off the bomb which killed Falcone.</p>
<p>A first trial for the Borsellino bombing ended in January with the conviction of four lower level Mafiosi accused of carrying out the killing.</p>
<p>A second trial began last month with 18 defendants including boss of bosses Riina, who was arrested in 1993.</p>
<p>The four men arrested on Tuesday were suspected low level Mafiosi.</p>
<p>One, Giuseppe Biondo, was suspected of preparing the remote control device which set off the car bomb. The other three were suspected of having provided shelter for Mafiosi.</p>
