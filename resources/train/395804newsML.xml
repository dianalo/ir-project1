<p>China has cancelled most celebrations for the annual lantern festival in mourning for the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of mourning for Comrade Deng Xiaoping we have cancelled all dances and singing for the lantern festival,&quot; said one official of the Workers Organisation office at Longqingxia in Yenqing county, site of one of the biggest festivals around Beijing.</p>
<p>The festival that marks the end of the 15-day Chinese lunar new year celebrations is a time when Chinese string up brightly coloured lamps, traditionally in paper but now many made of plastic, in parks around the country.</p>
<p>Since the economic reforms launched by Deng, who died at 92 on Wednesday, have fuelled greater freedoms, Chinese celebrate with traditional folk dancing and singing.</p>
<p>That will not happen on Friday, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;People can come to the parks to look at the lanterns, but they should do so quietly and respectfully,&quot; the workers official said.</p>
<p>The annual evening television spectacular broadcast by Chinese Central Television has also been called off, television station officials said.</p>
