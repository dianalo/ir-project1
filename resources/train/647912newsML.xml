<p>Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston met with Defence Secretary William Cohen on Monday amid expectation that Ralston might withdraw from consideration for the top U.S. military job over an adulterous affair he had years ago.</p>
<p>Ralston, 53, made no immediate comment as he left Cohen's Pentagon office after the meeting to discuss a controversy that erupted over the secretary's consideration of Ralston to become chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>Defence officials said they expected Ralston, vice chairman of the joint chiefs and a decorated Vietnam War veteran, to withdraw from consideration after admitting last week that he had an adulterous affair while separated from his first wife 13 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The handwriting is on the wall. I think he wanted to fight this thing, but it's just gotten too big,&quot; said one official of the highly regarded Air Force general.</p>
<p>Army Gen. John Shalikashvili, whom Ralston had been favoured to succeed in the top military job, meanwhile told reporters on Monday he would not consider delaying his Sept. 30 retirement to remain in the post for another two years.</p>
<p>Setting off a heated controversy, Cohen and the White House said when the controversy broke last week that Ralston remained high on the list of candidates to succeed Shalikashvili despite the affair.</p>
<p>But members of Congress quickly questioned the fairness of the military's application of strict rules against adultery, warning that the Senate might reject Ralston if he were to be nominated by President Bill Clinton to become the nation's new senior officer.</p>
<p>Cohen said last week that Ralston's previous affair should not eliminate him from consideration because it had not threatened &quot;the good order and discipline&quot; of the military.</p>
<p>But that comment came only weeks after the Air Force forced 26-year-old Lt. Kelly Flinn, its first woman bomber pilot, to resign to avoid a court-martial on charges of adultery, fraternisation, lying and failure to obey orders.</p>
<p>A senior Pentagon official said that Cohen, who departs on a week-long trip to Europe and the Gulf on Wednesday, was not expected to propose his choice for a nominee to Clinton until after his return.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, said a number of senior officers were under consideration including the chiefs of the individual U.S. military services and heads of commands around the world.</p>
<p>The controversy broke after the secretary repeatedly in recent weeks stood behind strict military rules involving sexual harassment while the Army is embroiled in a scandal over the rapes of female recruits by male drill sergeants.</p>
<p>Aside from crimes such as rape and other such harassment, many members of Congress are charging that junior officers and enlisted personnel are treated more harshly than senior officers in cases involving adultery.</p>
<p>&quot;Our (Ralston and Flinn) cases were very much the same, but we were treated very differently,&quot; Flinn wrote in a guest essay in Newsweek magazine this week.</p>
<p>&quot;What matters in these cases is not what really happened, but your rank, your gender and who do you know.&quot;</p>
