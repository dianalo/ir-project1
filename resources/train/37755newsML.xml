<p>Two German children were found dead in a hotel on the Spanish island of Majorca on Friday in what police believe was a suicide plot by their missing father, officials said.</p>
<p>Katharina and Matthias Oyntzen, aged 8 and 6 respectively, appear to have died from a poison injection, the officials said.</p>
<p>A chambermaid discovered their bodies on Friday morning in an apartment at a hotel complex in Sa Coma where they had been staying with their father Ruedger since August 23.</p>
<p>Police are looking for the man, a German doctor, who left behind two letters in which he said he planned to kill himself.</p>
<p>The family were frequent guests at the hotel. They were due to leave for Frankfurt on Friday.</p>
