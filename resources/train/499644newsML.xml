<p>An Australian judge on Thursday opened the door for hundreds, possibly thousands, of people to claim compensation from the manufacturer of peanut butter which was contaminated last year by salmonella bacteria.</p>
<p>Claimants who fell ill after eating peanut products made by Philip Morris Co's Australian subsidiaries Kraft Foods Ltd and General Foods Pty Ltd will participate in a class-action case.</p>
<p>Peter Slater, a lawyer representing the claimants, told Reuters that about 700 people would press for compensation after Australia's Federal Court accepted an unspecified settlement between the companies and lawyers representing the claimants.</p>
<p>He expected more people to join them before the August 19 cut-off for claims to be lodged.</p>
<p>An independent assessment panel would set different levels of compensation available to people according to the severity of the illness they suffered, he added.</p>
<p>Kraft Foods managing director Tom Park said in a statement he was pleased the &quot;mediation process&quot; had been resolved and that he was happy claims could now be processed.</p>
<p>&quot;Kraft has confidence in whatever figure the assessment panel feels is justified in individual cases,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Slater said he could not give an approximate figure on how much the companies must pay but expected it to be considerable because thousands had fallen ill after eating products which had been distributed around Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't give an exact figure -- it depends on the people actually eligible and who actually applies to join the action,&quot; Slater said.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure could run into many millions of dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some people have been severely affected and their claims may run up to A$100,000 (US$78,000) or more,&quot; Slater said, adding that serious cases represented about five to 10 percent of total claims.</p>
<p>A final agreement between the companies and the claimants' lawyers is expected to be approved by the Federal Court on June 19, after which the class action will be able to proceed.</p>
