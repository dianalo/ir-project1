<p>London cocoa futures ended with small losses in slow dealings as early short-covering and industry price-fixing fizzled out on sterling's strength in currency trading.</p>
<p>&quot;It ran out of steam. It ran out of buying. I think the trouble is because sterling has gone up against the European rates,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>The London cocoa contract is priced in sterling. Sterling climbed on Thursday against German mark and hit 10-month high versus the dollar after upbeat Confederation of British Industry retail survey, buoyed by unchanged UK interest rates.</p>
<p>By the finish, the benchmark December cocoa was six stg off at 969 stg a tonne. It had climbed to the day's high of 980.</p>
<p>Traders said the downside was well supported by lack of keen origin selling.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see much in the way of origin cocoa. At these levels, we don't expect them to sell,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Overall volume reached a modest 4,558 lots. Switches involving forward positions were active with March 1997/March 1998 seen trading at 70 stg.</p>
<p>On the charts, analysts pegged key hurdle at 1,000 stg basis December.</p>
<p>On the downside, the recent six-month low of 955 stg should serve as nearby support, followed by a four stg March chart gap under 950 stg and the March low of 935.</p>
