<p>An expert in DNA told the O.J. Simpson civil trial Thursday that blood found on Simpson's sock contained genetic patterns that matched those of his slain ex-wife.</p>
<p>Robin Cotton, who heads a commercial laboratory in Maryland, testified that she had tested 23 batches of blood or other human samples containing DNA. The samples were taken either from the scene where Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were murdered June 12, 1994, or from Simpson's estate.</p>
<p>One of those items she tested was a blood-stained sock, one of a pair found by police on the floor of Simpson's bedroom.</p>
<p>Cotton, who testified for several days at Simpson's criminal trial last year, said she ran a test of the blood on the sock and was able to examine the DNA or &quot;genetic fingerprint&quot; to compare it with the known patterns of Simpson, his ex-wife and Goldman.</p>
<p>&quot;The (genetic) pattern on the sock was not the same as Mr. Simpson's. It was not the same as Mr. Goldman's,&quot; she said. &quot;The pattern from the sock does match the pattern from Ms. Brown.&quot;</p>
<p>She said the chances of another person having the same genetic pattern were one in 6.8 billion.</p>
<p>In late testimony Wednesday, Cotton had told jurors that Simpson's blood contained the same genetic markers as those found in droplets of blood leading from the bodies.</p>
<p>Simpson, a former football star and TV personality, was acquitted by a criminal trial jury in October 1995 of the murders. He is being sued in civil court by the families of the victims who are seeking damages for the loss of their loved ones.</p>
<p>Simpson was absent from court again Thursday because he was in a suburban Orange County courthouse fighting a legal battle for permanent custody of the two young children he had with his slain ex-wife. The children have lived with their maternal grandparents since the murders.</p>
<p>At his criminal trial, Simpson's lawyers contended that the blood samples were either planted by police in order to frame Simpson or were contaminated at the police forensic lab.</p>
<p>During Cotton's cross-examination Thursday, Simpson attorney Robert Blasier tried to get her to acknowledge that DNA testing was not an exact science and was vulnerable to contamination.</p>
<p>During long questioning about microscopic techniques and littered with technical jargon, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ordered a brief recess after some jurors appeared to be nodding off.</p>
<p>&quot;This scintilating examination is having an effect on our jurors,&quot; he said, calling the 10-minute break.</p>
<p>When court resumed, Fujisaki apologised to Blasier for his flippant characterisation of the cross-examination. But he admonished the jury to stay awake.</p>
<p>&quot;Please let me know if you get drowsy,&quot; the judge said.</p>
