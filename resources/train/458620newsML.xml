<p>Ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko's plane landed in Zaire's capital on Friday but the veteran leader did not immediately appear causing considerable confusion about his state of health, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who has just had fresh cancer treatment, left France earlier on Friday on board the private jet to try to salvage what remains of his authority in Zaire in the face of relentless rebel advances.</p>
<p>A welcoming committee, which included senior military men and members of the government, waited for about 20 minutes to greet him before withdrawing. It was later asked to go to his official residence to wait. Journalists were ushered away.</p>
<p>Mobutu's limousine was waiting at the foot of the steps of the plane. His presidential guard was out in force but there were none of the crowds who turned out to welcome him during a triumphant homecoming on December 17.</p>
<p>Earlier, Laurent Kabila's rebels, who have been fighting to topple him since October, rejected a truce-then-talks call from the veteran leader and said his return made no difference.</p>
<p>&quot;We negotiate first,&quot; Kabila said on arrival in Zaire's third city of Kisangani, which fell to the rebels last weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Mobutu) always wants to buy time. But we will not play his game,&quot; rebel political commissioner Deo Bugera said there.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66, left hospital in Monaco on Wednesday after fresh treatment. He issued a statement on Thursday calling for a truce and a national council to find a peace settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;He will address the nation to mark his position clearly,&quot; his son Mobutu Nzanga told Reuters in Nice. &quot;My father remains an important player in the stability of Central Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>But many ordinary Zaireans, eager for a change from three decades of poverty and hardship under Mobutu, are openly rallying to Kabila. Residents of Kinshasa's poor districts openly welcome the prospect of his arrival in the capital.</p>
<p>Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) is advancing relentlessly across the sprawling and chaotic Central African nation, where central government control has long been notional in many places.</p>
<p>Under foreign pressure to agree a truce and talk, Kabila says only face-to-face talks with Mobutu can halt the fighting.</p>
<p>Mobutu's son, Nzanga, said on Thursday that his father no longer ruled out talks with rebel leaders but wanted to involve the government, army and transitional parliament. &quot;His intention is to find a solution to the present crisis in consultation with parliament, the government and the military high command.&quot;</p>
<p>Mobutu has spent most of his time in Europe since having prostate cancer surgery in August. He has dominated Zaire with a mixture of political acumen and military ruthlessness since seizing power in 1965.</p>
<p>He presented his proposed national council as a formula to find &quot;appropriate ways&quot; out of the crisis &quot;with all our brothers, without exclusion&quot;.</p>
<p>The rebels were not the only ones unimpressed. &quot;He is sure to come with his usual confusion. Everything is possible, a good move, a bad move and the worst possible move. But he will above all be thinking of himself,&quot; one senior government member said.</p>
<p>The rebels took up arms in October in a dispute about Zairean nationality for an ethnic Tutsi minority, who form the core of Kabila's fighting force. An alliance of anti-Mobutu groups rallied around the cause.</p>
