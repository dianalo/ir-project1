<p>An Iraqi Kurdish group said on Wednesday it was withdrawing from peace talks with a rival group due to Turkey's military involvement in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said an alliance between Turkey and their rivals the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) made Turkey unfit as a sponsor of the peace talks since it was no longer an impartial actor in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;The PUK has withdrawn from the peace process because of the treatment of Turkey who have sided with the KDP...the behaviour of the Turkish side no longer makes them fit to monitor the talks since they are no longer impartial,&quot; a spokesman from the PUK's office in London told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Thousands of Turkish troops poured over the border into northern Iraq in May in a joint operation with the KDP against Kurdish rebels who use the area to launch raids into Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;The PUK leader Jalal Talabani has written a letter to the Turkish authorities saying the politburo of the PUK is in complete agreement about withdrawing from the talks and asking them for an apology for their behaviour,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Months of fighting between the PUK and the KDP ended last year with a ceasefire sponsored by Turkey, Britain and the United States in which the sides agreed to a series of talks to be held in Ankara to help resolve their differences.</p>
