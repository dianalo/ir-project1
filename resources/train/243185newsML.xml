<p>Opposition protesters in Serbia demonstrating against election fraud showed no sign on Monday of relenting in their 20-day-old challenge to President Slobodan Milosevic's rule.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 students gathered in central Belgrade on Monday morning in their latest show of displeasure over the reversal of opposition victories in municipal elections on November 17.</p>
<p>The rally was the biggest in days and they vented their anger with a chorus of whistles outside Belgrade's police headquarters.</p>
<p>The students were outraged by reports of a savage beating meted out in prison to Dejan Bulatovic, 21, a worker from the northeastern town of Sid who was arrested on Friday for carrying an effigy of Milosevic in prison garb.</p>
<p>His mother alleged that her son's nose was broken, that he was forced to lie naked on the concrete floor of a prison cell with an open window and that, during the beating, a gun barrel was forced into his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of disturbing public law and order, (Bulatovic) was mistreated in the worst possible way in the worst Gestapo methods,&quot; the students said in an open letter of protest to Serbian citizens. &quot;Should we bow our heads and tolerate this? yesterday it was him, today it could be one of us or of you.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us not allow their crimes to go unpunished let us rebel against their brutality,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders hoped, meanwhile, that a decision by Serbia's top court on Saturday to award control of Belgrade city council to the ruling Socialists would draw out the biggest protest crowd to date later in the day.</p>
<p>They said a surprise move by the city's electoral commission to appeal against the Serbian Supreme Court ruling might mean that Milosevic, who is facing Western demands to honour democratic methods, could be pressed into holding a complete re-run of the controversial local elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision of the city electoral commission is a part of Milosevic's game of tricks and the only way to finish is to continue demonstrations until achieving (his) resignation,&quot; Vuk Draskovic, one of the the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition leaders, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Zajedno officials voiced concern that Milosevic might yet run out of patience and order his feared police to muzzle the protests despite his repeated promises to the West to avoid the use of violent methods to control the unrest.</p>
<p>They said they would press on with the protests, which they insisted would remain peaceful, until their demands were met.</p>
<p>Police forces have so far kept a low profile in Belgrade and other Serbian cities, but Draskovic said 100 demonstrators have been arrested so far.</p>
<p>Diplomats were concerned that the legalistic maneouvring by Milosevic and the delays could represent a test of the demonstrators' patience and a way of provoking them to violence.</p>
<p>But so far the biggest potential threats to Milosevic's authority -- organised strikes and workers' marches -- have failed to materialise.</p>
<p>&quot;In two days we will start with a few very important strikes in our basic union and I suppose it will be the beginning of a strike in general in Serbia,&quot; Rade Radovanovic, a leader of independent trade unions Nezavisnost told Reuters.</p>
<p>But a strike and protest march by workers at a Belgrade tractor factory failed miserably on Monday when only a few hundred workers of the 4,200 employed took part. Fewer than that number was prepared to march towards the city centre.</p>
