<p>Croat international Zvonimir Boban said on Saturday that Manchester United were interested in signing him, although he had not been contacted directly, but he wanted to stay in Italian soccer with AC Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that Manchester United have been following me for months but I have had no contacts with them,&quot; the midfielder was quoted as saying by the Gazzetta dello Sport. &quot;I have never spoken to Manchester United.&quot;</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Boban said he was flattered to think that the English premier league champions were after him but his ambitions lay more in Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a nice thought, it shows I am appreciated, but I have signed with Milan until 1999 and want to stay here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If I fit in with the club's plans I would be happy to stay. It would be sad to leave after such a bad season.&quot;</p>
<p>Milan, who play Fiorentina later on Saturday, are 12th in the league and their hopes of playing in Europe next season look dim though not totally extinguished as only six points separate them from fourth-placed Sampdoria.</p>
<p>The Gazzetta had reported on Friday that United had offered Milan $8.75 million for Boban. Sources at the club have previously suggested he was likely to be leaving.</p>
