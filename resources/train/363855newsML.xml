<p>Cincinnati Milacron Inc said Friday that 1997 would get off to a slow start on German cost cutting but end up showing an earnings increase of more than 15 percent over 1996.</p>
<p>Reporting 1996 fourth quarter and full year results, the company said new orders in the quarter totaled $441 million, up from $374 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>New orders in 1996 rose to a record $1.75 billion from $1.63 billion in 1995, while the backlog of unfilled orders climbed to $373 million, up 8.0 percent from a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Cincinnati Milacron reported 1996 net earnings of $66.3 million, a record high when excluding non-recurring items. On a per-share basis, net earnings were $1.73.</p>
<p>&quot;In response to the prolonged economic softness in Germany, we are currently incurring cost-cutting expenses in our Ferromatik operation, which will likely keep first-quarter earnings a little below year-ago levels,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures will begin to pay off quickly, however, and we expect positive year-over-year quarterly comparisons throughout the rest of 1997,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;At Cincinnati Milacron, we're setting average annual growth targets of seven to eight percent in sales and 15 percent or more in earnings per share. And we believe we can do this all through organic increases, that is, excluding the benefits of any future acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have good growth potential both in our home markets and in Asia, particularly India, where we have several successful joint ventures. So, assuming among other things that the European economy doesn't worsen significantly, we see these financial targets as attainable in 1997, even if we have a slow start,&quot; it concluded.</p>
<p>The company said directors authorized the repurchase of the company's common stock on the open market to meet the needs of its management incentive, employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans.</p>
<p>The company said it estimates that, instead of issuing new shares, it will repurchase between 250,000 and 300,000 shares for these plans during 1997.</p>
