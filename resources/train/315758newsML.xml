<p>Explosives experts prepared on Friday to begin a second day combing through the wreckage left by two bomb blasts that injured half a dozen people outside an Atlanta abortion clinic.</p>
<p>The first bomb exploded at a building housing the Atlanta Northside Family Planning Services centre in a suburban Sandy Springs at 9:30 a.m. EST (1430 GMT) on Thursday. At least one worker was inside the clinic but no one was injured.</p>
<p>But about an hour later, as federal law enforcement officials and local firefighters sifted through the debris, a second bomb detonated near a garbage container at the corner of the building's parking lot, injuring six people including agents from the FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).</p>
<p>Police said there was no warning of the attack and no one claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>The second explosion and the injuries it caused left investigators wondering if the initial device had been a so-called sucker bomb intended to lure police and other emergency workers into the area.</p>
<p>&quot;Very troubling about this particular investigation is the fact that a second device exploded after the first, at a time when law enforcement officials had been called to the scene,&quot; U.S. Attorney Kent Alexander told a news conference.</p>
<p>Federal, state and local officials worked into the night sweeping the shattered abortion clinic office and surrounding area for a possible third bomb.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other investigators concentrated on the site of the second device.</p>
<p>NBC affiliate WXIA-TV revealed in a late report on Thursday that federal agents had scrutinised its aerial footage of the scene and believed the second bomb had been placed not in the garbage container but in nearby bushes at the base of a telephone poll.</p>
<p>If correct, the report concluded, emergency workers and news reporters who had congregated a few yards (metres) away may have been spared serious injury by two parked cars that absorbed much of the concussive force.</p>
<p>Among those rushed to local hospitals were an FBI agent who was admitted for the night after suffering a bruise to his brain. An ATF agent also was treated for whiplash and ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>Although the abortion clinic appeared to be the target of the attack, Alexander said he could not rule out the possibility that the bombing was directed at other offices in the building, which also housed a drug rehabilitation clinic and a law office specialising in divorce.</p>
<p>&quot;Every resource available is going to be put on this,&quot; he said. &quot;Teams of ATF experts, teams of FBI experts are en route now. We've got a lot of local experts as well. This is a bombing we intend to solve.&quot;</p>
<p>Federal investigators also were checking for any links to last July's Centennial Olympic Park bombing in downtown Atlanta, which left two people dead and more than 100 injured. No one has been charged in that incident.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as any connection with the Centennial Park bombing ... we will know fairly quickly whether there's a similarity or not,&quot; said Alexander.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion activists attacked three abortion clinics in the Atlanta area in 1984, including the same facility involved in Thursday's bombing. No one was ever prosecuted for the attack on the Atlanta Northside Family Planning Services centre 13 years ago. At that time, the facility stood in a different location.</p>
