<headline>Zaire says Rwanda-based rebel attack town.</headline>
<dateline>BUKAVU, Zaire 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Zaire said on Tuesday ethnic Tutsi rebels backed by nearby Rwanda had gained territory in the eastern region of the country and gave them a week to leave or face fullscale war.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebels came from Rwanda and they have gained Zairean territory. We will not accept to have two armies on the Zairean territory,&quot; South Kivu deputy governor Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji told a news conference in Bukavu.  </p>
<p>The deputy governor said the Banyamulenge rebels had attacked the town of Lemera mid way between the cities of Uvira and Bukavu on October 6, killing all the patients and medicale staff at the hospital but he did not give the death toll.</p>
<p>He said the rebels had a week to leave or face all-out war.</p>
<p>Residents in the area had earlier said Zairean soldiers went on a looting rampage in Uvira in the early hours of Tuesday.</p>
<p>The region had already been tense because of a growing conflict between the army and the Banyamulenge people, ethnic Tutsis who arrived about 200 years ago from what are today Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
