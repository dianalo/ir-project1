<headline>Ohio child molester attacked by wife, mother-in-law.</headline>

<p>The wife and mother-in-law of a convicted child molester have been charged with assaulting the man with a cucumber and scrawling &quot;child molester&quot; on his body, authorities said on Friday.</p>
<p>Police in Delaware, Ohio, said a grand jury indicted Jewel Hosler, 28, her mother Mary Franks, 44, and a female friend on charges of rape and kidnapping for the alleged July 26 attack on Rodney Hosler, 27.</p>
<p>Authorities told the Delaware Gazette that Hosler was sitting in his apartment when the women burst in, wrestled him to the floor, tied him up and cut off his pants. They allegedly shaved his pubic hair, rubbed heat-producing ointment on his genitals and anally assaulted him with a cucumber.</p>
<p>After writing &quot;I am a child molester&quot; on his body, they drove him 70 miles (112 km) and dumped him behind a pizza parlour, the Gazette reported.</p>
<p>His father-in-law, Rick Franks, 43, pleaded innocent to a charge of bribery for allegedly offering Hosler $3,000 to drop his complaint. Mary Franks also pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Rodney Hosler was convicted in 1995 of gross sexual imposition with a child and was released from prison earlier this year after serving a 16-month sentence.</p>
<p>In another apparent case of revenge in Thibodaux, Louisiana, a teenager suspected of sexually assaulting a 4-year-old boy was severely beaten for hours and hung by his neck on Tuesday by the boy's father and another man.</p>
<p>John Trahan Jr., 17, was later charged with indecent behaviour with the child. Trahan was jailed late on Thursday after his release from a hospital where he was treated for two spinal fractures, swollen testicles, black eyes, contusions, scratches and whip marks, Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office spokesman Larry Weidel said.</p>
<p>Weidel said Trahan's half-brother John Bruce, 26, and his friend Jeremy Billiot, 24, stuffed Trahan into the trunk of their car, taking him out in different locations to beat him. At one point, the men stopped to buy beer, he said.</p>
<p>He said the pair tied a rope around Trahan's neck, stretched it to a fuel tank so only his toes touched the ground and beat him again while throwing bricks at his feet.</p>
<p>The two fled as a car approached, and Trahan freed himself and went to police. &quot;This guy (Bruce) just kind of jumped the gun. We were already getting warrants to arrest Trahan,&quot; Weidel said.</p>
<p>Trahan was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile and indecent behaviour with a juvenile for incidents with Bruce's 4-year-old son. He also was charged with carnal knowledge of another juvenile, his 14-year-old girlfriend, Weidel said. Bond was set at $30,000.</p>
<p>Bruce and Billiot were held in the same jail on $50,000 bond on charges of attempted first-degree murder and second-degree kidnapping.</p>
