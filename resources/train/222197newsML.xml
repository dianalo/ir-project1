<p>Stefan Edberg, hoping to end his distinguished international career with a Davis Cup triumph, on Thursday rated Sweden's chances of winning the final against France this weekend as 60/40.</p>
<p>Edberg and the Swedish squad were cautiously confident about the prospects of clinching the sixth Davis Cup title for their country in the three-day tournament starting on Friday in a converted shipyard workshop in snowy, southern Sweden.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Edberg, who is retiring from the international circuit after the Davis Cup, told a news conference he was not feeling too much pressure to lead the victory attempt as he was part of a strong team.</p>
<p>&quot;I know if I was not able to win my matches we can still win the match,&quot; said Edberg, who is ranked 14th by the ATP.</p>
<p>France's Guy Forget also saw Sweden as favourites, weighting the chances at 60/40.</p>
<p>In the Davis Cup competition to date, Sweden and France have met 10 times, most recently in 1994 at Cannes, and Sweden leads 7-3.</p>
<p>&quot;They are better ranked,&quot; said Forget, 31, who was among the French team who won the Davis Cup in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;They have the crowd advantage and a lot of times that makes the difference. But I think we still have a little chance and we will use it, I hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Sweden's top player, Thomas Enqvist, who is ninth in the ATP world rankings, was not so willing to predict which way the 84th Davis Cup final would go.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a strong team, We have a strong team. We are thinking positively,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The final will start on Friday shortly after 1330 GMT with the first singles between Cedric Pioline and Edberg. French number one Arnaud Boetsch faces Enqvist in the second singles later in the day.</p>
<p>On Saturday at 1500 GMT Sweden's doubles pair of  Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti will take on Guillaume Raoux and Forget.</p>
<p>The reverse singles on Sunday, starting at 1200 GMT, feature Pioline v Enqvist, then Edberg v Boetsch.</p>
<p>Boetsch said it would be an honour to be the last person to play against Edberg as the Swede bows out after a 14-year career in which he won six Grand Slam titles and played in seven Davis Cup finals, of which Sweden won four.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be great to shake his hand at the end of the match and to tell him that he is a great player and a great man,&quot; Boetsch said. &quot;He is a great example for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite a few concerns voiced earlier, all players on Thursday said they were happy with the hard surface at the venue. It is only the sixth Davis Cup final to be played on a hard surface.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a good surface. It is a surface where you can play from anywhere in the court, the back, the front, so it suits everybody,&quot; Edberg said.</p>
<p>Enqvist also said he was happy with the surface. &quot;It is getting quicker and quicker every day and that suits us.&quot;</p>
<p>The French squad was satisfied after a few days of training to adapt to the court that has been installed temporarily for the final.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the court is really good even though we have had a few bad bounces in the last few days,&quot; Forget said.</p>
