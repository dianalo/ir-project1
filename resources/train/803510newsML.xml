<p>The severed and smoked head of a 19th century Aborigine exhumed from a paupers' grave in Britain will be returned to Australia, where tribal elders plan to reunite the body in a traditional burial ceremony.</p>
<p>The skull of Aboriginal leader Yagan was exhumed on Thursday from a grave in Liverpool in northern England which also contained the bodies of 22 stillborn babies, a spokesman for Australia's Aboriginal affairs minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>Yagan's head was contained in a box which also contained remains thought to be those of a Peruvian Indian, the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Tests would be conducted at Liverpool University on the remains before Yagan's skull was handed over to Aboriginal elders in London and returned to Australia for burial.</p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders welcomed the exhumation saying that once the head was returned Yagan's spirit could be put to rest.</p>
<p>&quot;Culturally and traditionally it is the right thing to do,&quot; said Gatjil Djerrkura, chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</p>
<p>The head was hacked from Yagan's body after his murder near Perth in 1833 and then smoked to preserve it.</p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders had in the past accused Britain of stealing the head, which was sent to Britain and displayed in the Liverpool Royal Institution. The head was then sent to the city museum before being buried in 1964.</p>
