<dateline>MINNEAPOLIS 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nash Finch Co, the fourth largest public grocery wholesaler, and Super Food Services Inc said Tuesday they entered into a definitive merger agreement.</p>
<p>Terms provide for Nash Finch to initiate a cash tender for all 11.2 million outstanding Super Food shares for $15.50 per share.  </p>
<p>&quot;We expect 1997 sales for the combined companies to be approximately $4.5 billion,&quot; said Al Flaten, Nash Finch president, in statement.  &quot;We also expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings for calendar year 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the acquisition positions Nash Finch as a significantly larger and stronger player in the consolidating grocery business and &quot;will create the third largest public grocery wholesaler in the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Flaten will continue to serve as president of the merged company, while Super Food chairman and chief executive Jack Twyman will remain to assist with the transition.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is no significant geographic overlap of operations. Super Food has significant market presence in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky, while Nash Finch has especially strong operations in the Midwest and Southeast market areas,&quot; Flaten said.</p>
<p>Super Food, based in Dayton, Ohio, is a wholesale grocery distributor, supplying a complete line of food and non-food products to more than 850 retail stores in six states.</p>
<p>Nash Finch is one of the largest food wholesalers in the country, supplying products to affiliated and independent supermarkets, other independent retailers and military bases in approximately 30 states. It also owns and operates about 110 supermarkets, warehouse stores and mass merchandise stores in 16 states, and a produce marketing subsidiary in California.</p>
