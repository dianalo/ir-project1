<p>Serbia's opposition urged hundreds of thousands of people to turn out on Monday for an Orthodox calendar New Year's Eve demonstration they hope will be the biggest yet against President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>Students and the Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition, who have held daily protests for almost two months to force the government to reinstate the results of municipal elections held on November 17, planned to demonstrate from 10 p.m. to herald the new year.</p>
<p>&quot;See you tomorrow night at a gathering of a modern Belgrade and a modern Serbia,&quot; Zoran Djindjic, a leader of the tri-partite Zajedno (Together) opposition coalition, told a rally on Sunday.</p>
<p>One radio announcer covering the rally said the opposition was hoping 700,000 people would turn out on New Year's Eve, but Western diplomats and other political analysts thought it was unlikely that many would show up.</p>
<p>&quot;The crowd estimate keeps going up every hour,&quot; a diplomat said. &quot;But it is New Year's Eve tomorrow and there will be a lot of people around.&quot;</p>
<p>The opposition previously drew hundreds of thousands of people to central Belgrade for demonstrations on the eve of Orthodox Christmas, which is celebrated on January 7.</p>
<p>Similar New Year's Eve demonstrations were planned elsewhere in Serbia, where Zajedno victories in 14 of the 18 largest cities, including the capital Belgrade and the second largest city Nis, were cancelled by Milosevic's Socialist (SPS) government over alleged &quot;irregularities&quot;.</p>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos flew into Belgrade for a one-day visit on Sunday during which he talked separately to Milosevic and the opposition but made no apparent breakthrough.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't come here to play mediator and we didn't come to propose any kind of solution,&quot; Pangalos, whose country has close ties to Serbia partly because of the shared Orthodox faith, said during a joint news conference with Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic.</p>
<p>Milutinovic refused to be drawn on efforts to defuse Serbia's political crisis, telling reporters, &quot;This is not my press conference about those questions. We have a guest.&quot;</p>
<p>Pangalos said after a meeting with the Zajedno leaders that he thought a solution was possible based on a report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that upheld the opposition victories in the disputed elections.</p>
<p>But the official news agency Tanjug said Pangalos and Milosevic in their meeting had stressed the principles of &quot;equality, partnership and non-interference&quot; in international relations.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't actually think Pangalos's visit was going to be any great turning point because the Serbian government sees this as an internal problem,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
