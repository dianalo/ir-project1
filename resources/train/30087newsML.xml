<headline>UK watchdog dismisses 'parody' beer ads complaint.</headline>

<p>The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said on Wednesday it had dismissed a complaint about two advertisements for Michelob lager which parodied religious-style messages to promote the beer.</p>
<p>The ASA, Britain's advertising watchdog, said it had received a complaint from a consumer who objected that U.S. drinks giant, Anheuser-Busch's advertising -- using the slogan 'The Gospel according to St. Louis' -- mocked genuine religious messages and was offensive to people who &quot;drew comfort from them&quot;.</p>
<p>One ad showed trees and footsteps in the snow and claimed 'May I always have a Michelob for those I meet along my path'. The other, a postcard insert, said 'The secret of happiness is to give Michelob to others' and displayed a picture of flowers.</p>
<p>The advertiser told the ASA that its research showed that its target audience, who tended not to have &quot;deeply religious views&quot;, would not be offended by the publicity material. It was meant to be humorous, Anheuser-Busch European Trade Ltd said.</p>
<p>The ASA agreed the ads were unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence to readers.</p>
<p>The ruling came after Anheuser-Busch was attacked last month by American Indian advocacy groups for a British commercial which showed an American Indian drinking Budweiser lager -- an image, they said, which was insensitive to the alcoholism problem facing large numbers of American Indians.</p>
