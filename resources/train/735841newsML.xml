<p>South Korean commercial banks, battered by debt defaults by major companies this year, suffered a combined net loss in the first half of 1997, the central Bank of Korea said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said the 25 banks posted a combined loss of 77.8 billion won ($87.07 million) in the January-June period, against a 437.5 billion won profit a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The debt defaults early this year eroded profits of banks, especially those with big loan exposure to the troubled firms,&quot; said Park So-young, an analyst at Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>A Bank of Korea report said the banks' operating income fell by only 1.3 percent to a combined 2.26 trillion won in the January-June period from 2.29 trillion won a year earlier.</p>
<p>But a sharp 153.2 percent growth in loan-loss provisions outpaced the 71.8 percent drop in provisions to account for losses in the value of their securities portfolios.</p>
<p>Provisions for loan losses rose to a combined 1.54 trillion won from last year's 607.3 billion, while those for securities losses fell to 196.8 billion won from 697.8 billion, the report said.</p>
<p>Korea First Bank posted the biggest half-year net loss among the 25 banks due to its huge loan exposure to the two major firms that collapsed this year.</p>
<p>Korea First, one of the nation's top five commercial banks in terms of assets, was a major creditor of failed Hanbo Steel Co and Sammi Steel Co.</p>
<p>The bank's net loss for the six-month period widened to 356.5 billion won from a 34.6 billion won loss in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Without the debt defaults of Hanbo, Sammi and others, profits of banks would have been much better than the results,&quot; said James Han, an analyst at Dongbang Peregrine Securities.</p>
<p>Hanbo was declared insolvent in January after piling up some 6.6 trillion won in debts, followed two months later by Sammi Steel which had 1.45 trillion of debts at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The two failures sent a shock wave through South Korean industry and led to debt defaults by many of their subcontractors and affiliates.</p>
<p>SEOULBANK also saw its loss balloon this year due to its loan exposure to Hanbo and Sammi. Its net loss widened to 130.9 billion won from 69.4 billion last year.</p>
<p>Analysts said South Korean banks faced even gloomier prospects for the rest of this year after the Kia Group was picked for a bail-out by its creditor banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Kia's troubles will likely put additional pressure on profits of Korean banks, although not all of the group's loans will be classified as non-performing,&quot; said Dongbang's Han.</p>
<p>Korea First Bank, the biggest lender to Kia among commercial banks, said on Tuesday it had designated for bail-out Kia Motors Corp and 17 other of Kia's 38 affiliates.</p>
<p>Kia, the nation's eighth-largest industrial conglomerate, has been struggling due to worsening earnings at its major affiliates while its flagship Kia Motors has faced sagging domestic sales amid the economy's slowdown.</p>
<p>The group had 9.54 trillion won of debts owed to financial institutions at the end of May while its assets were estimated at 14.6 trillion won.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Kia troubles would make foreign lenders more reluctant to extend loans to South Korean banks or force them to raise the costs of funding, which in turn would become an additional factor damaging profitability.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks will see funding costs soaring and borrowing chances decreasing in international markets,&quot; said Park of Daewoo.</p>
