<title>USA: State lawmakers seek managed care standards.</title>

<p>A bipartisan group of state lawmakers said Monday they had drafted legislation setting quality standards for managed care health plans that they hope will become a model across the United States.</p>
<p>They plan on introducing the bill they call the Managed Care Consumer Protection Act in nine states, starting with New Jersey and Texas as early as Tuesday. They hope that lawmakers elsewhere follow suit.</p>
<p>The legislators said they seek a comprehensive approach, instead of piecemeal laws, to create consumer protection in the burgeoning industry of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other types of managed health plans.</p>
<p>They noted that many health plans already comply with many of these standards, and said that they were not opposed to managed care but were trying to strike a balance between patients and businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pro-consumer and should not be construed as anti-managed care,&quot; said Ohio lawmaker Charleta Tavares, a Democrat.</p>
<p>New Jersey Republican Barbara Wright, a registered nurse as well as a state assemblywoman, said, &quot;As a health professional, I was very concerned about quality, access, and the cost of health care.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill deals with such issues as access to medical specialists, grievance procedures, criteria for covering experimental drugs and treatments and ensuring that licensed physicians, not business personnel, are setting treatment policies.</p>
<p>But it does not include any specific mandates on what plans must cover, and the legislators said they did not seek to micromanage.</p>
<p>But the bill would set some general requirements, some of which run counter to common cost-cutting measures managed care companies now use.</p>
<p>For instance, it would require the plans to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and medical devices, not just those on a list drawn up by the health plan.</p>
<p>It would require health plans to let a patient see a doctor or specialist outside the plan's regular providers. The patient would have to pay part, but not all, of the outside bill.</p>
<p>The legislation was developed by Republicans and Democrats from around the country convened by a nonprofit organization called Women in Government.</p>
<p>The American Association of Health Plans, the main trade association for the managed care industry, said in a statement it supports &quot;the principles of consumer protection embodied in the model legislation.&quot;</p>
