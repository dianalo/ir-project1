<p>Suspected IRA activist Diarmiud O'Neill was buried on an Irish hillside on Thursday amid tight police security to prevent the guerrilla group giving him a hero's farwell.</p>
<p>Police ringed the tiny seaside village of Timoleague as hundreds of mourners filed to the imposing Roman Catholic church overlooking the sea for O'Neill's burial service.</p>
<p>Cars were searched, parking was banned and the village, which has a population of a few hundred, was brought to a standstill on a windswept but bright afternoon.</p>
<p>O'Neill, 27, was shot dead by special British security police during a raid on September 25 on a house in south London that netted tonnes of explosives and several weapons.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) made no attempt to give O'Neill the traditional guerrilla sendoff of a volley of shots over a tricolour-draped coffin to salute a comrade killed in its battle against British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>IRA membership is illegal in the Irish reublic and police were at pains to prevent any propaganda coup by the guerrilla movement, which has its main arms caches and rear bases in Ireland.</p>
<p>Sean McManus, a senior figure in the IRA's Sinn Fein political wing, was among the mourners, witnesses said. He made no comment to reporters, who were kept away from the family.</p>
<p>Other mourners included O'Neill's father and mother, who moved back to Ireland this year to their family cottage beside the sea a few minutes' drive from the church, and his girlfriend Carmele Ereno, who comes from the Basque region of Spain.</p>
<p>Timoleague priest Father James Coombes praised the lack of bitterness in the family. &quot;I have been most impressed with the dignity with which they carry their heavy cross,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There hasn't been a word of self pity, a word of bitterness, a word of recrimination. Their one concern was for the mass and the funeral today.&quot;</p>
<p>O'Neill was apparently unarmed when shot, causing allegations from Irish Republican sympathisers that police were operating a shoot-to-kill policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Shoot-to-kill evidence mounts&quot; said An Phoblacht, the weekely newspaper of Sinn Fein, which shares the IRA's goal of a united Ireland.</p>
<p>It published a picture of O'Neill on its front page, but the IRA has not printed a notice in the newspaper claiming him as a fallen volunteer, as is the usual practice when one of its activists is killed in action.</p>
<p>Timoleague in West Cork draws thousands of tourists in summer months but is a typically quiet Irish village in the winter with most activity taking place in the five pubs, two shops and a garage which doubles as a supermarket.</p>
<p>The region has attracted thousands of British settlers, many of whom have become Irish citizens in what Sinn Fein says is proof that Protestant and Catholic can live together in peace.</p>
