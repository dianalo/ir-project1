<p>Vancouver-based Nevada Star Resource Corp  plans to open a new copper mine in Mexico with a solvent-extract electrowinning (SX/EW) recovery plant next year, a company official said here Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will begin construction work later in the year and start production sometime next year,&quot; Stuart Havenstrite told the Mexico Mining 1997 conference here.</p>
<p>Havenstrite said that over an eight-year life of Nevada's leased property at La Virgen in central-south state of Michoacan, the company expected 77 percent heap leach recovery rates for a total of 69 million pounds of recovered copper.</p>
<p>Havenstrite said the property, which is close to the coastal steel city of Lazaro Cardenas, had mineral ore resources of four million tonnes of an average 1.12 percent copper.</p>
<p>Total indicated and inferred resources were 200 million pounds of copper and the mine had an estimated potential of more than 300 million pounds of copper, he said. Total production costs would run in the region of 30 to 40 cents/lb, he added.</p>
<p>Havenstrite said total capital and acquisition costs were estimated at $10.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;We still need to spend around $1 million before we make this thing bankable,&quot; he said, adding more drilling and feasibility and metallurgical studies needed to be completed.</p>
<p>Nevada Star, he said, was under the impression that permitting for the 600-hectare mine and plant would be a &quot;pretty fast track&quot; affair considering it was a zero-discharge facility.</p>
<p>Havenstrite said he also considered the mine capable of producing gold. His estimates were that it contained 300,000 ounces of reserves within 500,000 ounces of resources, with a 2.0 grammes/tonne equivalent average and estimated operating costs of $170 per ounce of gold.</p>
<p>Nevada Star also is prospecting for gold in the northern Mexican state of Sonora at two properties called Golden Triangle and Eagle Placer, Havenstrite said.</p>
