<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian gold stocks slammed as bullion battered.</title>
<headline>Australian gold stocks slammed as bullion battered.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian gold mining shares tumbled again at the market opening on Tuesday as the precious metal's price again fell sharply in offshore trade.</p>
<p>The gold index was down over four percent early, bringing losses in the last four sessions to a whisker short of 17 percent.</p>
<p>Sector heavyweight, Normandy Mining, opened nine cents or about seven percent lower at A$1.23, its lowest level in four and a half years and a loss in dollar terms of about A$450 million in market capitalisation since its A$1.52 close on July 2.  </p>
<p>Others to slide included Resolute Ltd which was 11 percent lower at A$1.70, Great Central Mines was down 4.4 percent at A$2.20. Newcrest Mining dived 6.3 percent to A$2.83 while Acacia Resources lost 4.8 percent to A$1.38, its lowest level since listing and well less than half its record high of A$3.47, reached in June 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;This is panic selling going on at the moment. People are jumping out in droves and things are being driven down so hard,&quot; said Hartley Poynton broker, Justin Hondris, noting that technical support around the 1,200 level had been lost.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is supposed to be a lot of technical support around the 1,200 mark in the gold index. It's fallen through that so it will be interesting to see how it fares.&quot;</p>
<p>Offshore developments look like rendering no assistance to the beleaguered sector, with traders saying they had few reasons to be optimistic about the outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not looking very flash,&quot; said a depressed, bewildered broker at a Sydney-based investment bank.</p>
<p>&quot;And indications are that short is the position to be in. It's hard to find reasons to buy when sentiment is the way it is.&quot;  </p>
<p>Looking further afield Hartley Poynton's Hondris said the effectes were not restricted to the the gold stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Its following through to the mining services area and assaying labatories. All these associated stocks are getting hammered,&quot; he said, citing labatories services group Scientific Services and contract miner Eltin as examples of the knock-on effect of the bullion price's plunge.</p>
<p>Scientific Services plumbed an eight week low of 75 cents before regaining ground to be 2.3 percent lower at 82 cents by 12.05 p.m. (0205 GMT).  </p>
<p>At the same time, Eltin was at A$1.88, down 10.5 percent and at its lowest level for nearly a year. Fellow contractor MacMahon Holdings slumped seven percent to 92 cents while Ausdrill shed 5.3 percent to A$1.42.</p>
