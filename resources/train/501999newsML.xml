<headline>ZIMBABWE MONEY RATES LOWER IN LIQUID MARKET.</headline>
<dateline>HARARE 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted lower on Friday, weighed down by improved liquidity on the back of an offer of treasury bills worth Z$1 billion.</p>
<p>Dealers said although the market had opened short, the central bank offer had boosted liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment the market is very liquid because of these treasury bills. They have offered more treasury bills than what they had anticipated,&quot; one dealer said, adding results of the daily auction were not yet available.</p>
<p>The dealers said NCDs maturing after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought at 17 percent and sold at 16.75 percent versus 17.50 percent and 16.50 percent previously while bank bills were quoted at 16.75 percent (buying) and in a range of 16.25 and 16.50 percent (selling) from 17 percent and 16.25 percent.</p>
<p>Call money was indicated down at 15.75 percent from 17 percent in a market short of Z$257 million at Thursday's close.</p>
