<p>Ethnic tension between Russia's volatile regions of Ingushetia and North Ossetia has escalated and at least one person has died in a spate of attacks, a Russian Interior Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday</p>
<p>The Moscow-based spokesman said an angry group of about 150 North Ossetians on Tuesday evening attacked an Ingush refugee camp in the Prigorodny district of North Ossetia, beating up a number of Ingushis and burning down two of their trailers.</p>
<p>The spokesman added, however, that the attack was preceded by two mine explosions in the district, in which two cars were blown up, killing one North Ossetian policeman and wounding six local residents.</p>
<p>&quot;After the two explosions, the situation in the district started getting very tense with North Ossetians, some of them armed, grouping around the refugee camp, showing their indignation. They attacked the camp and burned down two trailers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The refugees were among tens of thousands forced to flee their homes in the disputed Prigorodny district during a bloody conflict five years ago, and were returning to the still-disputed area.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Interior Ministry troops had been called in to restore order.</p>
<p>He added that early on Wednesday unknown gunmen  fired shots at North Ossetian police posts from the Ingush side in two separate incidents. Two local residents were wounded.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ingush President Ruslan Aushev as saying he again called on Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to impose direct presidential rule in Prigorodny district to avoid ethnic fighting between the two small nations.</p>
