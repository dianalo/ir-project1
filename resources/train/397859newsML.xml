<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday reported no concrete progress with China on human rights or breakthroughs on other issues.</p>
<p>But she told reporters she was satisfied with her first visit to Beijing and the fact Chinese leaders did not cancel the trip after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very well satisfied with the atmosphere as well as the substance of the talks,&quot; she said after four hours of meetings, including with President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>At a late night news conference, Albright said she had kept an earlier promise to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; on U.S. criticism of China's human rights record &quot;and they made clear their position.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is an issue on which we have a difference,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Albright also said that in the absence of any human rights progress, the United States planned to proceed with a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, faulting Bejing's record.</p>
<p>Later, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns was even more explicit. &quot;We don't believe that, based on these meetings, there is any imminent breakthrough in China's human rights views,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Albright announced that, following on  from U.S.-China agreement last November, expert talks on missile and nuclear technology transfers and chemical weapons would take place in mid-March.</p>
<p>China had improved its practices on nuclear cooperation with states like Iran and Pakistan but Albright told Chinese leaders Beijing's continued persistence in transferring missiles and chemical weapons components &quot;could be a problem in our relationship,&quot; a senior U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Overall, Albright said her first visit to Beijing as secretary of state reaffirmed America's commitment to strategic dialogue with China.</p>
<p>&quot;That dialogue may not remove all differences in our relationship. But it is expanding areas of cooperation and that serves the interest of both countries and the world,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Albright, who arrived in Beijing earlier on Monday, will leave early on Tuesday for home, winding up a nine-nation trip through Europe and Asia.</p>
