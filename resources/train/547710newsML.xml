<title>GERMANY: New Baby Benz will shock Mercedes buyers.</title>

<p>The new &quot;Baby-Benz&quot; A class car introduced Tuesday will shock traditional Mercedes buyers.</p>
<p>Mercedes cars have always been conservative, with classical styling, proven technology and have been sought after by the prosperous as a symbol of their success.</p>
<p>Not the A class.</p>
<p>Mercedes hopes the weird-looking, egg-shaped little car, bristling with new ideas, will have a powerful appeal for the young, and open up new markets for the company.</p>
<p>Mercedes say the A class has the interior space of a big family car but a body shorter than a tiny Ford Ka. The A class is 141 inches long, 2 inches shorter than a Ford Ka but is 63 inches tall - 9 inches higher.</p>
<p>But the car is said to give occupants the same crash protection than a bigger car because of the so-called &quot;sandwich chassis.&quot; This is a flat floor linked together with rungs like a ladder which gives the body strength.</p>
<p>The engine is inclined so that in a crash it will slide under the floor and away from the occupants.</p>
<p>The A class also takes some cues from multipurpose vehicles - luxury vans seating up to eight. Like the vans, the passenger seats in the A class can be removed to improve carrying space.</p>
<p>Power plants are of course much smaller than ever before seen in a Mercedes. These range from 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre gasoline engines to a 1.7--litre turbodiesel.</p>
<p>Lightweight aluminium and magnesium is used extensively to save weight.</p>
<p>To appeal to city drivers, the car can be ordered with a five-speed automatic transmission, and a clutchless manual device.</p>
<p>Prices are likely to start at about 30,000 marks ($17,000) when the cars start appearing in dealer showrooms in October.</p>
