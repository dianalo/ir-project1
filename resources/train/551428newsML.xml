<headline>US Treasuries open lower, profit-taking before GDP.</headline>

<p>U.S. Treasury price opened moderately lower on Wednesday due to some profit-taking before the government report on first-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP), analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Profit-taking has left Treasuries slightly lower ... but the declines have been marginal as continued interest in the dollar and gains in European debt markets have provided support,&quot; said Kim Rupert, economist at MMS International.</p>
<p>Rupert said before the upcoming data, activity is likely to be cautious.  </p>
<p>The market gets a full hand of new economic data during Wednesday's trading session.</p>
<p>The first-quarter preliminary GDP report, due at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT, is expected to be up 4.1 percent, after a 3.8 percent fourth-quarter rise, according to economists polled by Reuters. the GDP price index is expected to be up 2.1 percent after a 1.9 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1996. And the implicit deflator is expected to be up 1.7 percent after a 1.5 percent rise in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>In early dealings, the 30-year Treasury bond was down 7/32 to 95-9/32, yielding seven percent.  </p>
<p>In addition to the GDP report at 0830 EDT, the market will get the April New York NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Management) index at 0900 EDT/1300 GMT, the Chicago PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT.</p>
<p>However, two key reports -- the NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Management's) April survey and the Labor Department's April payroll employment data -- are not due until Thursday and Friday, respectively.</p>
<p>After a &quot;relief&quot; rally ensued on Tuesday on two softer-than-expected economic reports, the market is stationed at the loftiest levels it has been at in a month.  </p>
<p>One question is whether the 30-year Treasury bond yield could move below seven percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's enough momentum in this price action that we'll probably hold above 108-16 and test 110 (on the June bond contract) before we see some selling,&quot; said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>Stiles said the question then would be what to sell -- 10-year notes because of pressure from corporate supply and the upcoming Treasury refunding, or five-year notes.</p>
<p>&quot;You might worry about five years because they outperformed so much yesterday,&quot; said Stiles.  </p>
<p>Stiles said the bond market could absorb a 3.9 percent or 4.0 percent first-quarter GDP number.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very strong domestic demand,&quot; said Stiles. &quot;It's not a bullish number by any means. But the market is aware of first-quarter strength by now.&quot;</p>
