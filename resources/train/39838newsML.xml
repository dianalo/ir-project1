<p>Hizbollah sought a political comeback on Sunday in Lebanon's parliamentary election, bidding to win four deputies from the south after suffering humiliating losses in earlier rounds of voting.</p>
<p>Some 8,000 troops clamped heavy security on the volatile, predominantly Shi'ite Moslem south where 552,000 voters were eligible to choose 23 deputies to the 128-member parliament.</p>
<p>Voting was brisk at some polling stations in Nabatiyeh, the south's main Shi'ite town, as bearded men, and women in Iranian-style chadors -- black garments covering all but the face -- queued to cast their ballots in segregated booths.</p>
<p>The vote, and next week's poll in the eastern Bekaa valley, will decide the distribution of the majority of seats set aside for Shi'ites in the half-Christian, half-Moslem parliament.</p>
<p>Fears of violence between two powerful Shi'ite groups -- the secular Amal and the pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) -- were allayed at the last minute when Syrian mediation persuaded them to forge an election pact and run a joint list of candidates despite a history of armed clashes between them.</p>
<p>The Amal-Hizbollah ticket, headed by Amal chief Nabih Berri, the parliament speaker and a former civil war militia chieftain, included five Amal and four Hizbollah candidates. The rest were allies of Amal.</p>
<p>Berri and Hizbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah appealed to their voters to back the ticket but newspapers said many followers of the two groups were disappointed by the deal that appeared likely to make the vote more of a nomination than an election.</p>
<p>Amal allies on the joint ticket included four government ministers and Bahia Hariri, sister of billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri who is an ally of Berri but a sworn foe of Hizbollah. Bahia Hariri was included on the list over bitter resistance from Hizbollah.</p>
<p>The prime minister declared electoral war on the pro-Iranian group last month, calling the five-sage election a battle of moderation against extremism, and Hizbollah lost two parliamentary seats to government supporters in earlier rounds of voting.</p>
<p>The pro-Iranian group, which is fighting to oust Israeli troops from a south Lebanon border strip, had eight MPs and four supporters in the outgoing parliament but appears unlikely to match that number in the current election.</p>
<p>Two other lists running in the south were a 10-member leftist ticket and a 15-member list headed by Kamel Assad, a traditionalist politician and former parliament speaker.</p>
<p>Hizbollah fought Amal in a 1987-90 war for supremacy of Lebanon's 1.3 million Shi'ites.</p>
<p>Under the election pact, Hizbollah will have three candidates and two supporters on another joint list in next Sunday's voting in the eastern Bekaa Valley. If all its candidates win, its representation in the new parliament will be reduced by one deputy and two supporters.</p>
<p>A private Lebanese watchdog group that reported widespread violations in the first three rounds of voting reported more abuses on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Lebanese Association for the Democracy of Elections (LADE) said police were illegally inside many polling stations in the south, some of which lacked isolating curtains for voters to prepare their lists in secret, and names were missing from voter lists.</p>
