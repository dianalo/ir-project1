<p>The Singapore rubber trade ran into some selling on Tuesday in TSR20 rubber as some people liquidated their positions to take advantage of its steady prices in the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think some people decided to sell TSR20 rubber, especially since prices there are a bit high at the moment,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said major consumers were not seen in the market although Michelin and Bridgestone were said to have asked for quotes from people in the business. &quot;I think they found the price a bit too high for them,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some of these buyers would indicate they would be interested in certain price levels, but then would say that they still did not like the price,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Late deals for RSS3 rubber concluded on Monday were reported today. Dealers said the trade was also waiting for developments in Thailand, whose default in taking delivery of 23,100 tonnes of rubber last week had an adverse impact in the market.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, January/March RSS3 was seen at 104.00 U.S. cents a kg from 104.50 cents. September RSS1 was seen at 139.50 Singapore cents (95 U.S. cents) a kg from 139.75 cents.</p>
