<headline>U.S. debt futures post slight losses at the open.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>U.S. debt futures opened on a slightly weaker note Monday, regrouping after hitting another four-month high Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was under light pressure from profit-taking related to expiration of July Treasury bond options, which went off the board Friday. The expiration left many traders long the futures, on which some profits were taken this morning, one floor broker said.</p>
<p>September bond futures on Friday climbed to a new high of 112-24. The contract has made successive highs as it follows  a well-defined upward-sloping channel begun in April.  </p>
<p>Faced with a light economic agenda this session, traders said they anticipated debt futures would spend the day quietly consolidating near the weekly pivot point of 112-14/32.</p>
<p>The area from 112-07/32 to 112-05/32, just below the session low so far, was viewed as initial support and potentially a buy opportunity, with further support pegged at 111-20, traders said.</p>
<p>Resistance was seen at 112-17, just above the overnight high, and then at 112-29, a level roughly equal to a 6-5/8 percent yield on the long bond. Traders said they did not expect Treasury futures to test the yield level today.</p>
