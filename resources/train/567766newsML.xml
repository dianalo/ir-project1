<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - The Reserve Bank board meets on Tuesday, and ahead of the meeting economists were surveyed on their outlook for interest rates. A rate change was not expected in May. Most economists are looking for the next move in rates to be an increase in either late 1997 or the first half of 1998, but a rate cut in the next few months is still seen as possible. Full results are detailed on a separately.</p>
<p>Economists were also asked about their expectations for the underlying budget deficit in the 1997/98 year (July-June), which Treasurer Peter Costello will announce on Tuesday, May 13.</p>
<p>Treasury estimated in January a no-policy change starting point of A$3.9 billion for the year to June 1998, compared with a forecast A$8.5 billion for 1996/97. Economists' median forecast was for only a slightly better starting point.</p>
<p>The government has signalled it is not going to repeat the heavy fiscal cuts delivered last year, and most economists expect that policy changes will reduce the deficit by about A$1.5 to A$2.0 billion.  </p>
<p>That would still leave a small underlying deficit, although some felt that Costello would deliver a balanced budget, as was his original projection when the government won power in March 1996.</p>
<p>The government's current fiscal target is to eliminate the underlying budget deficit by 1998/99. On current policy settings the deficit is projected at A$2.2 billion for that year.</p>

<p>EMPLOYMENT - A rebound in employment after some weak numbers over February and March is not going to be enough to shift the unemployment rate lower. The data will be released as RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane delivers his first semi-annual report on the conduct of monetary policy to a parliamentary committee.</p>
<p>The high unemployment rate is the key factor behind the argument for a further interest rate cut, and if employment is weak in April that case will be strengthened.  </p>
<p>Even though it is seen as a lagging indicator, continuing weak employment could also raise some doubts on the strength of the recovery that is expected through 1997, as it would raise doubts on the ability of consumers to continue the pace of retail spending and housing investment seen at the beginning of 1997.</p>
