<p>Guatemala's new defence minister, Hector Barrios, pledged on taking office on Tuesday to carry out army cutbacks and reforms that are part of recent peace accords ending 36 years of civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;That path should be continued,&quot; Barrios told reporters following a swearing-in ceremony on the military base formerly under his command. &quot;My intention will be to strengthen the process (of peace).&quot;</p>
<p>Barrios took over from Julio Balconi, who was unexpectedly fired as defence minister last week by President Alvaro Arzu in a move that sparked fears of a shift toward hardliners in the military.</p>
<p>Balconi bid a tearful farewell on Tuesday after a three-decade military career that culminated with his role in negotiating the Dec. 29 peace accords ending war between the government and leftist rebels.</p>
<p>Human rights organisations initially criticised the departure of Balconi, known as the &quot;Peace General,&quot; and of Gen. Sergio Camargo as army chief of staff, also seen as a moderate.</p>
<p>But some said on Tuesday Barrios had calmed initial fears by speaking out strongly in the past week in favour of peace and reform of the country's powerful military.</p>
<p>Karen Fischer of the Alliance Against Impunity said she was more concerned about Camargo's replacement, Gen. Tulio Espinoza, than about Barrios.</p>
<p>Until last week's promotion, Espinoza was chief of the presidential guard, an elite army corps accused by the United Nations mission in Guatemala of illegally capturing and probably executing rebel commander Juan Jose Cabrera Rodas, alias Mincho, last year.</p>
<p>&quot;If Espinoza is innocent, he should demonstrate that,&quot; Fischer said.</p>
<p>Her organisation is pressuring the Public Ministry to open an investigation into Cabrera's fate. On Wednesday it plans to make a formal complaint against high-level government officials, including Espinoza and Arzu.</p>
