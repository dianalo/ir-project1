<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures hit new contract highs again late Thursday, boosted by a bullish AGA report Wednesday and forecasts for colder weather later this week and next, industry sources said.</p>
<p>At 1440 EST, January was up 23 cents at $3.735 per million British thermal units after hitting a new high of $3.77. February, which also rallied late to another new high of $3.40, was 22.4 cents higher at $3.38. Others also were up.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's AGAs definitely helped the rally, and prices were pretty good today in the cash, but people are getting cautious up here,&quot; said one Houston-based trader.  </p>
<p>AGA reported Wednesday that U.S. gas stocks fell last week by 104 bcf, well-above expectations in the 70-80 bcf range. Stocks are now 217 bcf, or 8.1 percent, below year-ago.</p>
<p>While temperatures in the East were expected to dip to five to 10 degrees Fahrenheit below-normal through early next week, forecasters were mixed on the longer-term outlook.</p>
<p>Technical traders pegged minor support in January in the $3.50 area, with major support at $3.10 and then at $3.04, a low from November 21. Resistance was seen at the new high of $3.77, then at the December expiration of $3.901 and then at the all-time spot continuation high of $4.05 hit November 21.</p>
<p>In the cash, Gulf Coast prices climbed almost 20 cents Thursday to the mid-to-high $3.80s. Midcontinent pipes were up almost a dime to the high-$3.60s. New York city gate gas climbed into the $4.70s early, then slipped back to the $4.50s, up 15 cents or more on the day.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 33,502 Hub contracts traded by 1415 EST.</p>
<p>NYMEX Alberta natgas was untraded at 1440 EST, but January was offered unchanged at $1.75.</p>
<p>NYMEX Permian natgas also was untraded at 1440 EST.</p>
<p>On KCBT, January rallied 25 cents to a new contract high of $3.58, while deferreds were six to 16 cents higher. The East/West spread narrowed by two cents to 15.5 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
