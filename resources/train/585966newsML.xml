<p>Romania needs clear laws to put order in the banking system and protect investors after two private banks had their licences suspended, the central bank (BNR) governor was quoted as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We need special legislation to allow authorities to impose strict control on a bank which is drifting away,&quot; Mugur Isarescu told the weekly business newspaper Capital.</p>
<p>His remarks were in reference to the troubled private banks Dacia Felix and Renasterea Creditului Romanesc Credit Bank.</p>
<p>The BNR stripped the banks of their licences last month but the move is subject to long court cases to determine whether they should be reorganised or liquidated. The BNR said they had high debts, low capitalisation and non-performing credits.</p>
<p>Isarescu said lax legislation had developed a &quot;drunkard's illusion&quot; in Romania's banking community. No local bank has been declared bankrupt since the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>&quot;A drunkard who opens a pub will always think that he can have free drinks there,&quot; Isarescu said. &quot;He will never consider the idea that someone will have to pay for them in the end. Some people had such illusions when they opened banks.</p>
<p>Last year, parliament passed a law entitling the BNR to help redeem small depositors in the two troubled banks.</p>
<p>Isarescu said current laws were so vague they allowed the two banks to &quot;bounce the BNR decision between tribunals for another two or three years&quot;.</p>
<p>Isarescu warned that if the banks won their case against the BNR, it would jolt Romania's banking system's credibility.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be bad, because the whole banking system would lose its credibility,&quot; he said. &quot;I always feared that once revealed, the weak parts of the legal system could reduce the central bank's surveillance capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank, he said, needed legislation allowing it to &quot;intervene quickly in the banking industry and replace owners who use up the capital, change the board which pushed the bank to collapse and introduce a special administration&quot;.</p>
