<p>A South Korean appeals court on Monday commuted the death sentence on ex-president Chun Doo Hwan, mastermind of the 1980 massacre in Kwangju, and cut the jail term of another former president.</p>
<p>The court also reduced the sentences on a clutch of generals tied to the events and let five business tycoons, including the head of the giant Daewoo group, walk free from bribery charges.</p>
<p>In decisions that outraged victims of the 1980 military atrocity and softened the impact of an anti-corruption drive, the Seoul High Court granted leniency to nearly all leading actors in the country's &quot;trial of the century.&quot;</p>
<p>The most dramatic decision was to commute Chun's death sentence to life imprisonment on charges that included ordering an attack on democracy activists in the southern town of Kwangju. Several hundred died when a May 18 insurrection was put down by crack paratroopers.</p>
<p>The verdicts, laced with sayings from the Chinese classics and even Latin, set off gasps of disbelief and anger among 250 spectators, including families of some Kwangju victims. Outside the court, the mother of one victim, Lee Keum-soon, wept as she denounced the decision.</p>
<p>&quot;This is obviously a prepared script. My son was handicapped during the Kwangju massacre. The people of Kwangju are still living with anger from that incident,&quot; she told reporters.</p>
<p>Nearby, 15 protesters staged a sit-down demonstration.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring back my son to life,&quot; one protester yelled.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel cut to 17 years from 22-1/2 years the jail term for Chun's successor, Roh Tae-woo. It also reduced the jail terms of 12 former generals, kept one unchanged and upheld the acquittal of a 14th general.</p>
<p>Jail terms of up to three years imposed on Daewoo founding chairman Kim Woo-choong, as well as the chairmen of the Dong-Ah and Jinro groups were suspended for three years. The chairman of Daewoo Corp., a unit of Kim's Daewoo group, was cleared along with the chairman of the Hanbo Group.</p>
<p>The businessmen whose sentences were suspended had been convicted of bribery, mainly involving business contracts, during August's verdicts against the two disgraced ex-presidents. Chun was president from 1980 to 1988 when he handed over to Roh who ruled until 1993.</p>
<p>Chun and Roh were convicted of mutiny and treason over a 1979 coup that launched Chun's political career and led to the Kwangju atrocity. Separately, they were found guilty of amassing hundreds of millions of dollars in slush funds.</p>
<p>Dressed in pale blue prison uniforms -- Chun prisoner 3124 and Roh prisoner 1042 -- stood side-by-side as the panel's decision was read.</p>
<p>Chief Judge Kwon Sung, explaining that a reason for Chun's sentence being commuted was that he peacefully transferred the presidency to Roh, added:</p>
<p>&quot;Losing political power doesn't necessarily mean death.&quot;</p>
<p>In another part of his ruling the judge said: &quot;A general who surrenders should not be put to death.&quot;</p>
<p>In reducing Roh's sentence the judge said: &quot;Although Roh is guilty of similar charges, we have to differentiate between a mastermind and a follower.&quot;</p>
<p>Both men can make a final appeal to the Supreme Court and President Kim Young-sam also can grant full pardons.</p>
<p>Kwangju families said the verdicts were a cynical political manipulation ahead of presidential elections next year.</p>
<p>Current head of state Kim Young-sam needs the support of right-wingers, who once rallied around Chun and Roh, in picking his successor after his term expires.</p>
