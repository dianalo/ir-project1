<title>JAPAN: JGBs plunge as Nissan Life woes cause rate fears.</title>
<headline>JGBs plunge as Nissan Life woes cause rate fears.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-04-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and futures plunged on Friday as Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co's business suspension, the first such case among insurers in the postwar period, triggered fears of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Japan's low interest policy has been blamed for low returns on investments.</p>
<p>Traders said sentiment was also hurt by worries that Nissan Life may be forced to sell its assets, including yen bonds, and by concerns over possible bond sales from other life insurers to take a share of the burden to help Nissan Life.</p>
<p>The key June 10-year JGB futures ended down 1.13 at 125.50.  </p>
<p>June fell to 125.30 in the last minute of trade, its lowest intra-day price since March 27. Turnover was 73,042 contracts.</p>
<p>The June's loss was limited in early trade on expectations that Tokyo stocks might fall on fears due to fears about a deterioration in Japan's financial system after the Finance Ministry ordered Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Co to halt business except for servicing current customers.</p>
<p>But aggressive selling hit the market, apparently from hedge funds, capping the topside, traders said.</p>
<p>There was talk that hedge funds have been selling JGB futures aggressively since Wednesday, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today's fall was mainly due to speculative selling by foreigners. Such selling was seen from early in the morning,&quot; said a trust bank dealer.</p>
<p>A dealer at a securities house said: &quot;Amid a lack of buyers, selling triggered selling toward the close as dealers were taking profits in a selling rotation.</p>
<p>&quot;No strong buying was seen from investors today because the downtrend was attributed to fears of higher interest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Some said there was a market talk that Nissan Life may have sold some 300 billion yen of its JGB assets in the morning. But this was denied by company president Hiroshi Yonemoto.  </p>
<p>Referring to the rumour, Yonemoto told a news conference Friday afternoon that Nissan Life had not done so. He also said that the company expected to report a net loss of 52.5 billion yen for the year that ended in March, and this forced it to give up efforts to continue its business.</p>
<p>MOF has asked the Life Insurance Association of Japan, an industry group representing life insurers, to manage Nissan Life's business and assets.</p>
<p>Nissan Life held about 280 billion yen worth of domestic bonds at the end of March 1996, traders said. The yield of key 182nd 10-year JGB was up 0.110 at 2.265 percent at 0740 GMT.  </p>
<p>There was also a vague rumour that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may raise interest rates in May at the earliest. This was partly fueled by the fact that BOJ did not launch an outright bond buying operation on Friday. Rumours of a reduction in the central bank's outright bond buying re-emerged this week.</p>
<p>Some fear that a rise in interest rates, aimed at preventing a further fall in the yen against the dollar, may be agreed upon at the upcoming Japan-U.S. bilateral talks. But if there is no such agreement, the market may rebound as many dealers had gone short in the last few minutes of trade, traders said. --- Risa Maeda Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-33432-8570</p>
