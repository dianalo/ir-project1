<p>Evergreen Forests Ltd announced on Friday the purchase of 3,500 hectares of mature forests in South Auckland from Fletcher Challenge Forests.</p>
<p>Evergreen said it would fund the purchase with a placement of 30 million shares at NZ$0.55/share to mainly U.S. based institutional shareholders, and the balance through an increase in the company's existing capitalised term loan facility.  </p>
<p>Evergreen said the placement had been negotiated directly with the company and was not underwritten.</p>
<p>&quot;These high quality South Auckland freehold properties have near-term harvest potential and will give rise to early cash flows,&quot; Evergreen said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the purchase would increase its plantation estate to nearly 17,000 stocked hectares.</p>
<p>&quot;Evergreen's strategy is to add value by acquiring mid rotation and mature forests. This acquisition represents a material step towards a medium term goal of attaining a balanced 30,000 hectare estate,&quot; Evergreen said.  </p>
<p>Fletcher Challenge Forests said the sale was further progress on its New Zealand strategy of focusing on the central North Island forests.</p>
<p>It followed the announcement of the sale of 25,000 hectares of East Coast forests in December, for NZ$210 million.</p>
<p>&quot;This is part of our drive to become internationally competitive in the supply of high value solid wood products to key global markets and we are on track to have geographic synergy gains provide significant economic benefits to the organisation,&quot; FCL Forests said.</p>
