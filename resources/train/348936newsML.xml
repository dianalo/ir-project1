<p>Train services were disrupted in Portugal on Friday by a one-day strike by workers protesting against the restructuring of loss-making state railway company CP-Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a good turnout. Dozens of urban passenger and goods trains have been cancelled,&quot; Jose Manuel Oliveira of the Federation of Portuguese Workers' Unions told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said about 5,000 workers, including some train drivers, had joined the strike, representing 70 percent of the membership of the Federation. The Federation includes about 8,000 of Portugal's 14,000 railway workers.</p>
<p>Americo Ramalho, spokesman for CP, told TSF radio train services had been disrupted in the suburbs of Sintra, Amadora and Queluz near Lisbon.</p>
<p>Oliveira said the strike was to protest against CP's restructuring plans, reduce excessive working hours and demand improved career structures.</p>
<p>The Socialist government said last month that the state railway would invest some 600 billion escudos ($3.7 billion) in a three-year restructuring plan under which it would be split into two and private firms allowed to run some operations.</p>
<p>From February, the CP will cease to exist. It will be replaced by one operating company for passenger and freight services and another for infrastructure.</p>
<p>Oliveira said many station workers were working 12-hour shifts even though regulations limited the working day to eight hours.</p>
