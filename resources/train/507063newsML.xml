<p>Nearly 1,200 French, Italian and Spanish soldiers will land in Albania by sea and air on Tuesday to establish two bridgeheads for an Italian-led security mission to the troubled Balkan state, Italy said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;D-day is tomorrow,&quot; Admiral Guido Venturoni, Italy's Defence Chief of Staff and overall commander of the eight-nation force, told a news conference. &quot;D-Day will see the first large scale insertion of forces.&quot;</p>
<p>A few hours after he spoke, navy ships led by the Italian command vessel Vittorio Veneto left from the southeast port of Brindisi to cross the Adriatic to the Albanian port of Durres.</p>
<p>Relatives of some of the Italian servicemen were on the dock to watch the departures, staged without any military fanfare.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm only a little bit worried but you're always a bit concerned when your son goes on a mission like this. I just want to wish all of them good luck,&quot; said Mario Galati, there to wave off his 22-year-old sailor son Mauro.</p>
<p>Venturoni said the Durres landing would involve 450 French, 350 Spanish and 200 Italian soldiers. A further 150 Italian paratroopers are due to land at Tirana airport on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The force will number up to 6,000 when full deployment is expected to be completed over the next three weeks.</p>
<p>Rules of engagement for the mission, dubbed Operation Alba (Dawn) by Italy, include the right to self-defence.</p>
<p>&quot;Force will be used only when it is indispensable,&quot; Venturoni said, adding however that soldiers would not stand by as United Nations peacekeepers at times had to do in Bosnia and watch if they witnessed violence against individuals.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have the right to use force...to protect people from serious criminal acts,&quot; Venturoni said.</p>
<p>Durres, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana, and the capital itself are two of the three bridgeheads for the force, which has U.N. Security Council approval to assist in an international relief mission to Albania, Europe's poorest country.</p>
<p>The third is the southern port of Vlore, in rebel hands since an armed uprising erupted last month following the collapse of fraudulent savings schemes and brought Albania to the brink of anarchy.</p>
<p>Venturoni, outlining the mission after a final planning meeting in Rome of diplomats and military experts from contributor nations, said plans to deploy to Vlore entirely by sea had been changed because of unfavourable port conditions.</p>
<p>Troops would now secure Vlore by land and sea as the mission unfolded.</p>
<p>In Athens, Greek army chief Lieutenant General Manoussos Paragioudakis said a company of Greek soldiers was expected to reach Vlore on Thursday by sea from the port of Salonika.</p>
<p>The force comprises soldiers from Italy, France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Austria, Denmark and Romania.</p>
<p>Contingents will gradually deploy throughout Albania, with bases in 10 towns from Shkoder in the north to the port of Sarande in the south from where they will patrol key transport routes to assure the distribution of aid.</p>
<p>Albania's armed insurrection has claimed nearly 300 lives, with tens of thousands of weapons in the hands of lawless mafias and ordinary Albanians after raids on abandoned state armouries.</p>
<p>Venturoni said soldiers had no mandate to confiscate weapons but he believed Albanians would hand back their guns as security was re-established. &quot;That is the hope,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The troops have an initial U.N. mandate to remain in Albania for three months but Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi has said their stay could be extended for a further three months.</p>
<p>Early general elections are scheduled to take place by the end of the June under an all-party agreement between President Sali Berisha and opposition parties that has set up a national unity government led by opposition Socialist Bashkim Fino.</p>
