<headline>Turkey to slightly relax restrictions on press.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-07-23</dateline>

<p>Turkey's new government took steps on Wednesday to relax restrictions on the press in a limited move that may not be enough to satisfy Ankara's human rights critics in the West.</p>
<p>The government delivered a draft law to the parliamentary speaker's office proposing suspending the trials or sentences for three years in some press cases.</p>
<p>But the proposal affects only newspaper editors regarded as legally responsible for what journalists under their charge write. The journalists can still be tried under Turkey's many limits on press freedoms.</p>
<p>&quot;They are trying to escape from intense pressure with special amnesties. Thought must no longer be a crime in Turkey. This can't be done by limited special actions, the real solution is for thought to be decriminalised,&quot; Meral Bekar, a Human Rights Association spokesman, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The measure will lead to a number of jailed editors being released.</p>
<p>Last week, new Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz promised legal measures to secure the release of the editors in a visit to Turkey of the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), highlighting the case of jailed editor Isik Yurtcu.</p>
<p>The CPJ presented Yurtcu with an award for his fight for freedom of the press in Turkey.</p>
<p>Yurtcu was jailed in 1994 for a series of articles about the Kurdish guerrilla campaign in southeast Turkey which appeared in the pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Gundem.</p>
<p>Yurtcu was the paper's &quot;responsible editor&quot;, which means he both managed the paper's reporting staff and was legally responsible for articles printed.</p>
<p>Yurtcu fell foul of Turkey's anti-terrorist laws which forbid publication of propaganda from &quot;terrorist&quot; organisations and Article 312 of the penal code which bans &quot;provoking enmity&quot; between ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The CPJ says there are 78 jailed journalists in Turkey, the highest number of any country in the world.</p>
<p>Turkey's poor human rights record, along with economic troubles and bad relations with neighbour Greece, have hindered its efforts to join the European Union.</p>
