<p>Riot police clashed with worshippers near mosques in Bahrain over the weekend and arrested several people, an opposition group said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Riot police carried out acts of aggression against worshippers at Ras Roman mosque on Friday,&quot; the London-based Islamic Freedom Movement said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;They beat and arrested a large number of citizens after noon prayers,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>A Bahraini government official told Reuters police had dispersed a group of people who had gathered near the mosque in the capital Manama, but gave no details.</p>
<p>The opposition statement said police also clashed with worshippers at a mosque in the Shi'ite village of Daih, five km (three miles) west of Manama, on Thursday after women staged a demonstration in the nearby village of Sanabis.</p>
<p>It said the demonstrators were demanding the release of Sheikh Abdul-Amir al-Jamri, a prominent Shi'ite clergyman and a former member of parliament, who was detained 11 months ago.</p>
<p>Around 27 people have been killed in two years of sporadic unrest by members of Bahrain's majority Shi'ite Moslem community seeking political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have also been detained in connection with waves of violence, arson attacks and protests.</p>
