<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ interest rates to have downward bias - Westpac.</title>
<headline>NZ interest rates to have downward bias - Westpac.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-08-27</dateline>

<p>New Zealand interest rates will have a downward bias from now on as financial markets anticipate an easing in monetary policy, Westpac Banking Corp said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, Westpac said in its September Economic Overview that rates would still remain relatively high over the medium term. The bank said it was &quot;much less confident about the medium term outlook for inflation than the Reserve Bank&quot;.</p>
<p>Westpac said its forecasts show underlying inflation bottoming in the second half of 1997 at 1.3 percent before rising slowly to settle at 1.6 percent a year later.  </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand in its June monetary policy statement forecast underlying inflation at 0.9 percent in December 1997, slipping to zero by December 1998.</p>
<p>Despite its higher forecasts, Westpac said, it continued to believe the Reserve Bank should be willing to sanction an easing in monetary conditions.</p>
<p>It agreed the case for doing so was not yet overwhelming, even though latest readings on the domestic economy had confirmed a broad slowdown in activity.  </p>
<p>&quot;The data are likely to be more convincing by October/November. Financial markets will anticipate this easing as the weaker economic data comes to hand. Therefore interest rates will tend to have a downward bias from now on,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange front, Westpac said any short-term weakness would be limited and a firm currency remained the most likely short-term outcome.</p>
<p>For most of this year the massive interest rate differentials between New Zealand and almost every other western country had provided a solid foundation for the currency.  </p>
<p>Clearly tighter monetary policy in New Zealand at a time when policy around the world was generally easing had left the spread wide open, limiting short-term weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;However there are cracks opening up on forecasts of a more bullish outlook for the New Zealand dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view of generally falling interest rates in New Zealand, especially when monetary authorities elsewhere look set to tighten, suggests that the interest rate differential (although still positive) may ease back somewhat,&quot; Westpac said.  </p>
<p>It expects a slowing in the annual rate of appreciation in the Trade-Weighted Index, and said more volatile currency movements could be seen as jittery financial markets headed towards New Zealand's first election under proportional representation on October 12.</p>
