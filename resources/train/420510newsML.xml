<p>The Middle East and North Africa, long shunned by global financiers as an investment desert, are rapidly turning that perception around as economic reforms take hold, the IMF said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;What you are getting is a step adjustment,&quot; said Mohamad El-Erian, the International Monetary Fund's deputy director for the Middle East after an investor presentation in London.</p>
<p>&quot;For a long time perceptions were being impacted by the Arab-Israeli conflict, but investors are now going beyond the socio-political aspect -- they are looking at the fundamentals of the region, at what these countries have actually achieved in terms of economic reforms.&quot;</p>
<p>Development across the region remains uneven, but countries like Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon, Tunisia and Algeria have brought joy to profit-hungry investors by starting to privatise their economies and make them accessible to foreign portfolio and direct investment (FDI).</p>
<p>Morocco alone aims to win $1.5 billion in FDI by the turn of the century, finance minister Mohamad Kabbaj told the meeting, and officials from Egypt, Tunisia and Lebanon are also in town to encourage more inward investment.</p>
<p>But investors say Sudan, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Syria are starting to lag, at least in the portfolio stakes, since foreigners cannot invest in quoted equity in any of them.</p>
<p>Key in determining which nations will dominate in the increasingly fierce competition for emerging market investment is policy-making at the macro-economic level.</p>
<p>El-Erian said that until 1995, Middle Eastern countries represented less than one percent of the portfolio flows moving into developing countries, and very little FDI.</p>
<p>&quot;The major reason relates to macro-economic policies,&quot; he said. &quot;Countries with sound macro-economic policies can deepen relations with the international markets in a most substantial fashion.&quot;</p>
<p>The main challenge relates to the development of a market infrastructure, and to the establishment of developed world standards of disclosure, payment and settlement rules.</p>
<p>Jeremy Paulson-Ellis, chairman of Genesis Investment Management which holds Middle East and North African assets chosen on a company by company basis, said low levels of domestic savings was a critical weakness for the region.</p>
<p>Savings levels in the high teens or low twenties as a percentage of GDP distinguished the area from Chile, with around 28 percent, and Asian tigers like Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and China, all with well over 30 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Any initiative to boost domestic savings should be regarded as significant because it allows these economies to shift into a higher gear,&quot; Paulson-Ellis said.</p>
<p>He said the region's outlook had transformed itself since the 1991 Gulf War, the new openness deriving from fundamental political change, from the favouring of free market policies over central planning, and economic reform tied to World Bank involvement and loans.</p>
<p>While he saw Iraq, Libya, Algeria and Iran still posing a threat, regional stability had increased, with companies able to plan long term and foreign direct investors able to consider the region seriously.</p>
<p>El-Erian cited Jordan and Egypt in particular as leading lights for their exceptional economic performance.</p>
<p>&quot;They stand as a signal to the rest of the region that they don't have to be in southeast Asia to be successful,&quot; he said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734</p>
