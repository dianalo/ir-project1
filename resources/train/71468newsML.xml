<headline>INTERVIEW - Inchcape recovery out of neutral.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>International distribution and marketing group Inchcape Plc, which has undergone a far-reaching restructuring during an 18-month period of weak profitability, said on Monday its interim results showed the start of recovery.</p>
<p>A rebound in the &quot;critical&quot; business of importing and distributing mainly Japanese cars had been vital, Finance director Rod O'Donoghue told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the real essence of this recovery is in the motors import and distribution where clearly we have had greatest difficulty (in recent times),&quot; O'Donoghue said, adding trading margins, asset turn and return on net assets had all climbed.  </p>
<p>His comments and optimism came with a set of results that showed virtually no change in headline pretax profit, at 82.8 million stg compared with 83.3 million stg a year ago.</p>
<p>Last year, however, exceptional restucturing charges brought the attributable interim bottom line into loss and in full-year 1995 Inchcape made a sharp total dividend cut to 10p from 15p.</p>
<p>O'Donoghue said the interim payout for the first half, at 4.2p versus 6.0p, was in line with a more conventional approach now being taken by the group to pay a smaller interim dividend and seek to make the final dividend larger.</p>
<p>But he said rebuilding the total payout would take time.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've said we'll rebuild the dividend in the medium term and in anybody's jargon that's probably two to three years. That's a clear goal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Inchcape is pressing on with its well flagged restructuring plan to divest two large non-distribution businesses by the end of this year.</p>
<p>However, despite a high level of expectation in the share market, the company made no announcement on Monday about progress with either a trade sale of its Testing Services company or the probable demerger of insurance broker Bain Hogg.</p>
<p>After these moves the group will have three core businesses.  </p>
<p>Inchcape's management have identified its strengths in future lying in international distribution where, O'Donoghue said, it feels the group's capabilities are the highest.</p>
<p>At present, these interests are spread over motor importing and distribution, marketing -- including a stake in a business machines venture called Inchcape NRG -- and drinks bottling.</p>
<p>The progress made in the first half in motors was partly offset by continued setbacks in the marketing business where weak demand squeezed returns down to unacceptable levels.</p>
<p>O'Donoghue called marketing's 7.0 percent return on net assets &quot;clearly too low&quot;, after 10.1 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>In motor importing and distribution, meanwhile, the trading margin picked up to 1.4 percent in the first half compared with a trough of 0.9 percent in second half 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;I sincerely hope we'll continue that improvement,&quot; O'Donoghue said, noting that the business aims to sustain a 2.5 percent margin, excluding currency and market factors.</p>
<p>Motors' return on net assets tracked flat at 15.4 percent, after 15.6 percent in full year 1995, while asset turn, which reflects the speed with which cars are moved through the chain from order to delivery, improved to 11.5 times from 8.5 times.</p>
