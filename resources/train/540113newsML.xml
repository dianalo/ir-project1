<p>Pensioner George Musgrave has finally fallen victim to his own invention -- he was fined for parking on a yellow no-parking line 50 years after Britain adopted his idea.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't blame the traffic warden. It is one of those ironies,&quot; he said by telephone from his home in the southern seaside resort of Eastbourne.</p>
<p>Musgrave, almost killed as a child when crossing the road, won a safety competition in 1947 when he suggested yellow lines be painted on the side of roads to designate areas where vehicles could not park.</p>
<p>Police adopted his suggestion and Musgrave, a former missionary, was given a two-pound prize.</p>
<p>Now, at the age of 81, the invention has finally caught him out.</p>
<p>&quot;I received the magnificent sum of two pounds then which I have now returned to the community with my 20-pound ($32.40) parking fine,&quot; he said.</p>
