<p>Nigeria's military government is keen to diversify its oil-dependent economy via the export of the tuber crop cassava and its by-products.</p>
<p>&quot;As the world's largest producer of cassava, we hope to become a major exporter of the commodity in due course in order to earn much-needed foreign exchange for our economy,&quot; Asuquo Asuquo, deputy director-general in the ministry of agriculture, said on Tuesday at the end of a two-day seminar on cassava.</p>
<p>The seminar, &quot;Expansion of Cassava Utilisation&quot; was held in the southwestern city of Ibadan and attended by crop scientists, farmers, businessmen and journalists.</p>
<p>It was organised by agricultural organisations including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) -- founded in 1967 to improve crop yield.</p>
<p>Cassava, described as the &quot;poor man's crop&quot; and grown on the marginal soils of lowland farms in Nigeria's rain forest and the middle belt states, is a staple food in most homes of the country's 100 million people.</p>
<p>Asuquo said Nigeria produced 31.4 million tonnes of cassava in 1995 and there was need to export the surplus after local demand had been met.</p>
<p>Since 1995, government has been talking of diversifying the economy by returning to exports of solid minerals and agricultural products.</p>
<p>&quot;We have lifted the ban on export of cassava and are doing everything possible to ensure people are interested not only in exporting it but also in large quantity,&quot; Asuquo said.</p>
<p>The Government announced in its fiscal budget in January that it had lifted the ban on cassava exports, in place since 1988.</p>
<p>Asuquo said his ministry had been involved in many cassava multiplication projects, in collaboration with IITA and other organisations, aimed at raising production.</p>
<p>A new agency called Federal Agricultural Market Expansion Group (FAMEG) which is aimed at enhancing productivity and marketing exports of root and tuber crops was launched in June and had begun operations, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been creating public awareness and encouraging farmers and industrialists to export agricultural products,&quot; Foluso Denton, FAMEG's operations officer, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Awoniyi Awoga, exports marketing officer at the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, said: &quot;Great propects abound in Nigeria for the export of cassava and its derivatives...but we must launch them as well into the identified export market.&quot;</p>
<p>Crude oil exports account for slightly over 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign earnings.</p>
