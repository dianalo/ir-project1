<p>The rouble was little changed in lively trading on Monday as banks sought funds to invest in government bonds and to square balance-sheets for the end of quarter, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some rouble shortage is felt on the market as banks are investing in T-bills,&quot; one dealer said and added credit rouble rates could firm further ahead of Wednesday's auctions.</p>
<p>Overnight rouble credits yielded 40-60 percent compared with Friday's late 20-40 percent.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the central bank is auctioning 8.5 trillion roubles of six-month paper and 1.5 trillion roubles in a new tranche of three-month bills.</p>
<p>Dealers said banks also needed roubles for closing their quarter-end balances and making compulsory reserve payments at the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the quarter-end, everybody needs roubles and rates are standing still. But the dollar could resume its rise after the new quarter starts,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He added the central bank was checking rates but not intervening in trading after selling dollars last week to satisfy higher rouble demand. Rouble rates have been stable over the last week.</p>
<p>Central bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said on Saturday the bank had bought dollars in recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last days of this month, we are buying dollars. It is a market fluctuation, nothing else,&quot; he told reporters after a meeting with G7 central bankers and finance ministers in Washington.</p>
<p>Roubles for today settlement were quoted at 5,403-05 per dollar compared with an early 5,405-07 and 5,397-5,400 late on Friday. Tomorrow roubles were stable at 5,406-10 per dollar.</p>
<p>The central bank said it had set 5,387/5,417 as its bid and offer rates against the dollar on Monday.</p>
