<p>Authorities declared a state of emergency in the Mississippi Delta town of Leland on Thursday after hundreds of angry residents rioted over the mysterious death of a black motorist.</p>
<p>After surveying a trail of damaged police cars, broken shop windows and the charred interiors of two downtown businesses, Mayor Sam Thomas imposed a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew that he said would remain in effect through the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;There won't be any Halloween tonight or the rest of the week. You will either be off the streets or in jail,&quot; said the mayor.</p>
<p>Leland is a town of about 6,300 people, located just east of Greenville, Mississippi, on the western cusp of the state's impoverished Delta region.</p>
<p>The disturbance began late on Wednesday when about 400 protesters marched on the local police department in hopes of addressing Mayor Thomas and Police Chief Mike Dees about the death of 29-year-old motorist Aaron White, authorities said.</p>
<p>When the mayor and police chief agreed to speak only with the march's organisers, the crowd's tempers flared and soon police cars parked outside were being pelted with rocks.</p>
<p>Angry residents ran amok through the downtown, smashing the windows of 10 businesses, throwing rocks at passing cars and hurling firebombs into two stores.</p>
<p>No one was hurt, however, and there was only one arrest during the disturbance, which finally ended at about 1 a.m. local time on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've never had anything like this in my 25 years as a policeman,&quot; Chief Dees said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is the worst thing that could have hit this town. I am really ashamed of the people who acted like this. I am personally ashamed that this happened.&quot;</p>
<p>But state Representative Jimmy Thornton, who represents many of the black communities in Washington County, blamed the disturbance on community dissatisfaction with local officials which flared after the Oct. 17 death of White, a local television repairman who died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p>Initially, police said an officer killed White in an exchange of gunfire after the man crashed his pickup truck into a tree at night in a rural area.</p>
<p>But on Monday, authorities ruled White's death a suicide, saying an autopsy showed he had been killed by a .38-calibre pistol, the same kind he was carrying. The policeman who shot at him had a higher calibre pistol.</p>
<p>Thornton said that 1,500 people met at a local high school to discuss White's death on Wednesday evening and then marched on the police department.</p>
