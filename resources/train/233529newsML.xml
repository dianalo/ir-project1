<headline>B.A.T considers financial services options.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>B.A.T Industries has considered merging its financial services business with a quoted composite insurer, but this proposal may have floundered, said analysts.</p>
<p>Tobacco to financial services giant B.A.T. has been looking at several options for improving shareholder return. These have included merging its financial services arm, comprising mainly general and life insurance companies, with another insurer.  </p>
<p>Press reports suggested the insurer was Commercial Union and shares in CU spiked 9.5 pence higher to close at 669.5 on a day when the index of 100 leading London shares fell 16 points.</p>
<p>Neither CU nor B.A.T would comment on the reports, which said the proposals had floundered. Analysts suggested discussions at an early stage could run into difficulties for several reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;Discussions can break down on value, management, vision, business fit and mix,&quot; said an analyst who declined to be named.  </p>
<p>A raft of tobacco litigation in the U.S. is perceived to be a risk to B.A.T and has affected its share price. In July, B.A.T placed its financial services units under one umbrella, fuelling speculation they might be demerged from the tobacco business.</p>
<p>The financial services business comprises U.S.-based insurer Farmers, British general insurer Eagle Star, British life assurer Allied Dunbar, UK Threadneedle Asset Management, and associate Canada Trust.</p>
<p>B.A.T chief executive Martin Broughton indicated at the end of October he was not necessarily in favour of a pure demerger, arguing this might not boost long term cashflow significantly.</p>
<p>However, merging the financial services arm into a new entity with a quoted composite insurer might produce convincing returns for shareholders in both companies.</p>
