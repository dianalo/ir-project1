<p>Adelaide broker Day Cutten forecasts average 14 percent annual net profit growth before abnormals for cement maker Adelaide Brighton Ltd for the next two years, with earnings rising to A$15 million in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Analyst Nick Ross said the current price, A$1.61 at the time of writing, nonetheless represented a 12 percent premium to the broker's &quot;average&quot; benchmark valuation of around A$1.44.</p>
<p>Ross recommended lightening in the short-term (three months) and holding over the medium-term (12-18 months).  </p>
<p>The broker forecast a further rise in net profit before abnormals to A$17.5 million in 1997/98, up from A$13.3 million posted in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Ross said a slight lift in non residential construction and an accompanying rise in cement volumes, together with a fall in operating costs, should boost earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We forecast a 12.8 percent rise in net earnings (pre-abnormals) in the current year with growth of around 17 percent the following year, depending on the timing of the sale of the New Zealand assets,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Ross said Adelaide Brighton's cement operation continued to be hampered by overall flat demand, with little growth expected in 1996/97.</p>
<p>A modest 10 percent rise was expected in cement volumes in Western Australia in 1996/97, on the back of a number of large resource projects.</p>
<p>But Queensland and Victoria would report a slight fall off with little growth expected in new housing activity, he said.  </p>
<p>Ross said a number of new infrastructure projects would come on stream in calendar 1997 which could benefit Adelaide Brighton, including the Victorian A$1.2 billion City Link, and freeway work in South Australia.</p>
<p>Volumes and revenues for the company's Hawaiian Cement joint venture were not expected to recover for at least two years, with a major highway project now complete and no major new infrastructure projects in the pipeline, he said.  </p>
<p>The financial outcome of a legal suit in Hawaii also was an unknown, with a penalty, which would have to be paid for by Adelaide Brighton and not its insurers, which could range from A$100,000 to A$10 million, he said.</p>
<p>Ross said positives for the company in its 1995/96 results were the sale of the Gunpowder copper mine with no residual liabilities, increased production at the Birkenhead plant, cost savings, and improved profitability from New Zealand operations.</p>
<p>Negatives were the substantial abnormal loss from the Gunpowder sale, a 13 percent fall in earnings before interest and tax, a cut in dividends and fall in franking, he said.  </p>
<p>Ross said management was intent on being involved in the ongoing rationalisation of the domestic cement industry, and one area of potential rationalisation was the Victorian bagged cement market which had four competitors.</p>
<p>Adelaide Brighton shares were trading at A$1.60 at midmorning on Tuesday, down two cents from Monday's close.</p>
