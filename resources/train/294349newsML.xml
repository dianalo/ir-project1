<p>Britain's public debt will continue to shrink this year and should meet the Maastricht rules on a single European currency but with an election approaching some question marks still hang over the country's finances.</p>
<p>In its November budget, the British Treasury forecast a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of 26.4 billion pounds ($44.7 billion) this financial year, falling to 19.2 billion pounds next year. Those figures could well be met, analysts say, no matter which of the two main parties wins the forthcoming election.</p>
<p>But given the ambitious inflation target priced into the government's forecasts and untested plans to recoup billions of pounds through a crackdown on welfare fraud, there could well be some slippage.</p>
<p>&quot;The spending plans are based on very low forecasts for inflation,&quot; Alissa Goodman, research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studiesm, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>She said most economists forecast underlying inflation a fair bit higher than the 2.5 percent the government has factored in for this year, up at three percent or above. &quot;If that comes to pass, that would imply substantial real cuts in spending.&quot;</p>
<p>Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, expected inflation to overshoot the government's target significantly but said that might not do much damage to the public finances as resulting rises in public spending would be at least partially offset by a higher tax take as nominal wage levels increase.</p>
<p>What was more certain was that healthy economic growth would boost tax revenues and cut the PSBR, he said, forecasting a shortfall of about 18 billion pounds next year. &quot;The existing targets are pretty credible.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodman said another area of doubt stemmed from the government's expectation of recouping nearly seven billion pounds over the next three years through a crackdown on welfare fraud -- the so-called &quot;spend-to-save&quot; programme.</p>
<p>After the November budget, Gavyn Davies, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and one of Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's independent economic advisers, told the Treasury select committee those plans did not stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to say if those forecasts are plausible,&quot; Goodman said. &quot;It's purely getting more out of the existing structure.&quot;</p>
<p>Furthermore, with elections due by May and opinion polls suggesting a Labour government is likely to take over, there must be some doubt as to whether Labour would faithfully follow the Conservatives' spending plans despite endless protestations that public spending budgets will be kept under strict control.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Labour leader Tony Blair told a press conference there were no hidden spending increases in Labour's programme. &quot;Where we plan to spend money, we say where it comes from. There is no evasion, no double dealing, no hidden agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the jury may well remain out in the financial markets until a new Labour government, if elected, unveils its first budget. That is likely to happen soon after an election.</p>
<p>&quot;From what Labour have said, it seems they would stick to existing spending plans and just make tax changes at the first budget,&quot; Goodman said.</p>
<p>Labour has pledged to cut value-added-tax on fuel and introduce a windfall tax on the privatised utilities.</p>
<p>Gardiner agreed that Labour's spending and tax plans would be geared towards neutrality. &quot;But the risk under Labour is that the PSBR will be larger. They will find it tough to restrict public sector pay.&quot;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he thought Britain's debt would easily meet the criteria demanded of those wishing to join a single European currency, namely a budget deficit of no more than three percent of GDP and a total debt/GDP ratio of less than 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;That shouldn't be a problem,&quot; Gardiner said. &quot;It's the inflation criteria that could be tough.&quot; ($1=.5904 Pound)</p>
