<p>An Israeli parliament member who met with Yasser Arafat said on Saturday the Palestinian president wanted U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross replaced as peace talks mediator.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Arafat) said he's ready for mediation or arbitration as long as it is not done by Dennis Ross,&quot; said Yossi Beilin, a key figure in peace talks that led to the breakthrough Israel-PLO peace in 1993.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Arafat was on a one-day visit to Jordan on Saturday.</p>
<p>Beilin, whose Labour party was ousted by hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in elections last May, met Arafat in the Gaza Strip on Friday.</p>
<p>Ross was due in Israel later on Saturday to advance stalled talks on Israel's long-overdue withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron. Belin said Arafat did not explain his objection to Ross.</p>
<p>&quot;I said to him that that would be his biggest mistake, that the United States is the sponsor and Dennis Ross is its representative and even if he would like to have others, the best thing that he could do is to accept Ross as a mediator because that's the only way to make progress in the Hebron talks,&quot; Beilin told Reuters.</p>
<p>A PLO official said Ross would travel to Gaza upon landing in Israel for a meeting with Arafat late on Saturday.</p>
<p>The United States, sponsor of Israeli-Arab peace talks launched in 1991, has pressed Israelis and Palestinians to finalise an accord on Hebron and move on to negotiations on an overall peace deal.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put the onus on Arafat on Thursday, saying Israel had &quot;made some moves&quot; in talks on Hebron and it was up to the Palestinians to respond.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing is that Mr Ross has to be an accurate mediator and not to be biased on the side of Israel,&quot; Arafat said in Gaza on Friday.</p>
<p>Israelis and Palestinians accuse each other of foot-dragging in talks on Hebron.</p>
<p>Arafat has demanded Israel implement the partial withdrawal agreement it signed more than a year ago. Netanyahu has sought changes to protect around 400 militant Jewish settlers living among 100,000 Arabs in the town.</p>
<p>Palestinians said settlers scuffled with Arab school children on Saturday in Hebron, a flashpoint for Arab-Israeli violence.</p>
