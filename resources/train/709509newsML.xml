<p>Two photographers said on Sunday they needed hospital treatment after bodyguards tried to prevent them taking pictures of U.S. President Bill Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, who is on holiday in Italy.</p>
<p>The two paparazzi, Riccardo Germogli and Marco Savoia, told local reporters they were chased through the narrow streets of this central Italian city by the bodyguards after they started taking photos of Chelsea as she left a disco late on Friday night.</p>
<p>Germogli and Savoia said they were punched and shoved by two bodyguards before local police intervened. The two photographers were given first aid treatment at a nearby hospital.</p>
<p>Chelsea Clinton is on a private visit to Italy but was spotted by Italy's ever-present paparazzi on Friday evening while she was dining at Harry's Bar.</p>
<p>&quot;She is much more beautiful than she seems in photographs,&quot; bar manager Leo Vadorini was quoted as saying.</p>
