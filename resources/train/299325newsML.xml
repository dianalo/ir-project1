<p>The municipal yield curve flattened over the week ended Thursday, Delphis Hanover Corp said Friday.</p>
<p>The triple-A yield curve between one-year and 30-year munis flattened 10 basis points to 190 basis points, while the Baa curve flattened five to 190 basis points.</p>
<p>Thirty-year, Aaa-rated municipal yields fell five basis points to 5.60 percent. Thirty-year Baa yields also fell five basis points to 6.40 percent, reversing the prior week's rise.</p>
<p>Over the same period, the Treasury long bond rose one basis point to 6.75 percent, after gaining 15 basis points the week before. But Friday morning's release of strong December jobs data pushed the yield to 6.84 percent.</p>
<p>Thirty-year, Aaa-rated munis were yielding 83 percent of the Treasury long bond at the close Thursday, compared to 83.8 percent the week before.</p>
<p>Average yields on one-year Aaa-rated municipal bonds were up five basis points to 3.70 percent, while Baa-rated one-years were unchanged at 4.50 percent.</p>
<p>In the intermediate sector, ten-year Aaa-rated municipal bonds were unchanged at 4.90 percent, and Baa-rated ten-years rose five to 5.80 percent.</p>
<p>The credit spread between Aaa-rated and Baa-rated one-years narrowed five basis points to 80 basis points, while the 30-year spread was unchanged at 80 basis points.</p>
