<p>Singapore high sulphur fuel oil prices eased on thin demand, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A bid was seen for May loading 180-cst supplies at $98.00 per tonne, fob, against an offer at $99.00.</p>
<p>Trading interest was thin and demand lackustre, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most traders were focusing on the gas oil market,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Trader said some arbitrage cargoes arrriving in the Far East have added more pressure to prices.  </p>
<p>They said a French major who was bringing in a 80,000 tonnes of high viscosity 3.5 percent sulphur grade fuel from Venzuela has already sold the cargo to a trader. Another oil major was heard to be bringing in another arbitrage cargoes from the west. But traders said most South Korean supplies scheduled for loading in late April have all been placed.</p>
<p>On SIMEX, active trade was seen. A total of 70 lots were traded for both June and July months. Both months were last traded 30 cents higher from its previous close with June and July at par at $97.60 per tonne.  </p>
<p>In the LSWR market, traders were expecting Indonesia to allocate 3.6 million barrels in May, unchanged from its April allocation. They said Indonesia is also likely to roll over 500,000 barrels from April, bringing the total May allocation to 4.1 million barrels.</p>
<p>The market is soft but traders said increased summer demand from Japan and South Korea may boost levels.</p>
<p>Most traders are sidelined while awaiting details of state-owned Pertamina's May allocation.  </p>
