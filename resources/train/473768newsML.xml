<title>THAILAND: Alphatec down 14 pct in heavy trade.</title>

<p>Shares of Thai computer giant Alphatec dropped sharply in heavy trade early on Thursday as investors unloaded the stock as it turned ex-dividend, analysts said.</p>
<p>Alphatec topped the active list and dropped 20 baht to a new year low of 123 by 0400 GMT. The shares had closed overnight at 143 and opened this morning at 137.  </p>
<p>&quot;They paid a 6.50 baht dividend so some people will just have been hanging on until they got that, but I also think investors are re-rating this stock to a lower base because the whole risk of the SubMicron venture has been shifted on to Alphatec,&quot; said an analyst at a Japanese broker.</p>
<p>Alphatec has pledged to help fund SubMicron Technology, which is building Thailand's first wafer fabrication plant, after bearish conditions in the Thai market prevented the firm raising funds through a domestic listing.</p>
<p>&quot;The addition of SubMicron will impact ATEC sharply as SubMicron is forecast to lose 1.5 billion baht ($57.7 million) in 1997 and 1.8 billion baht in 1998,&quot; said Thaimex Finance and Securities in a recent report.</p>
<p>Alphatec's longer term prospects remain sound as SubMicrom is expected to return 1.5 billion in profit in 1999, but short term profits will be hit, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially I think the response to the consolidation was good but short term, probably the next two years, there is some risk and I think that is adding to selling pressures today,&quot; the analyst said. ($1 = 26 baht)</p>
