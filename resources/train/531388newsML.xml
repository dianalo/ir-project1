<p>Innovative financial engineering could help entrepreneur Andrew Regan to raise 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion) to fund an ambitious bid for Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS).</p>
<p>Banking sources said on Wednesday that Nomura International, the Japanese securities firm which on Tuesday said it would finance the takeover if it went ahead, could use its expertise in the relatively new field of securitisation to raise some of the funds.</p>
<p>Securitisation involves raising debt via bonds backed by cashflows from assets owned by the company. These techniques have been widely used by mortgage and credit card firms, mainly in the U.S., but the market is gradually establishing a foothold in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The financing may well involve some securitisation,&quot; a director of structured finance at a British bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Initially, the funding would almost certainly be in the form of a straight loan. Some would be refinanced through securitisation at a later stage.&quot;</p>
<p>Regan, via the specially formed Galileo Group, is interested in the Co-op's non-food businesses.</p>
<p>CWS has said it will vigourously defend the attempted takeover, but if Regan does succeed he is expected to sell off the profitable Co-operative Bank, its supermarket outlets, and the Co-operative Insurance Society.</p>
<p>&quot;Regan is expected to be left with a wholesale distribution business, and there could be receivables (outstanding debt due to the company from its customers) there which could be securitised,&quot; a debt specialist at a European bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Securitisation works best where there are third party receivables in the business. If it's a distribution business, it could be the customers who buy on credit terms and you could securitise those flows,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bankers said it was still unclear whether Nomura was providing short-term funding in the form of a bridging loan, or long-term funding, which could involve securitisation.</p>
<p>If it does opt for a bank loan, the deal is likely to be fully underwritten by Nomura itself, bankers said, adding that some banks may not want to get involved with Regan due to the bad publicity surrounding him.</p>
<p>Nomura has pioneered the use of complex financing techniques to fund acquisitions but these deals have also been controversial and often related to British privatisations.</p>
<p>Last year, it financed part of a 1.6 billion pound purchase of Ministry of Defence married quarters via bond transactions linked to rental payments. It has also raised money for British Rail rolling stock companies.</p>
<p>But the complexity of securitised transactions requires detailed analysis of underlying assets, making it hard to fully prepare before there is full access to CWS's books.</p>
<p>&quot;You can see how many receivables there are on the CWS balance sheet, but the raw total does not tell you what they do or where they come from,&quot; a British banker said.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be surprised if securitisation would be a huge part of the financing. Initially, it will almost certainly be a straight loan. You can make preparations before the purchase but you cannot do the deal until you have had a close look at it.&quot;</p>
