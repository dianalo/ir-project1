<title>INDIA: Kashmir leader sees no Indo-Pakistan breakthrough.</title>
<headline>Kashmir leader sees no Indo-Pakistan breakthrough.</headline>

<p>The chief of India's Jammu and Kashmir state said on Monday he did not expect any breakthrough in peace talks next week between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah said it would take time for the two neighbouring rivals to settle their longstanding differences over the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, are set to meet on May 12 in the capital of the Maldives, Male.</p>
<p>Their first face-to-face meeting as prime ministers would come ahead of a regional summit of the leaders of the seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not one of them who really thinks Male will achieve something really fantastic,&quot; Abdullah told a news conference, saying he had been briefed about next week's talks.</p>
<p>&quot;But at least the ice will break and gradually this 50 years of turbulence that has been there, tearing these two nations apart, will gradually be bridged,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Gujral said he hoped next week's meeting with Sharif would lead to warmer relations.</p>
<p>&quot;We will try to find a way out of the deadlock in Indo-Pakistan relations and I hope we will find a way to improve relations to our mutual benefit,&quot; United News of India quoted Gujral as saying late on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Gujral-Sharif meeting will follow two rounds of high-level talks which resumed in March after three years of bitterness between the South Asian neighbours.</p>
<p>It would be the first meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries since April 1993, when Nawaz Sharif and then Indian prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao met on the sidelines of a SAARC conference.</p>
<p>Last month, before being named prime minister, Gujral held upbeat talks in New Delhi with Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan. As a goodwill gesture, they agreed to free several hundred fishermen detained for illegally fishing in each other's waters.</p>
<p>Abdullah said he supported Gujral's willingness to offer concessions to India's smaller neighbours in order to strengthen relations.</p>
<p>But he said until Pakistan gave up its claim to all of Kashmir, it would be difficult to settle the issue. &quot;It will take some years for Kashmir to come back to normalcy,&quot; Abdullah said.</p>
<p>The Jammu and Kashmir leader said a proposal to convert a ceasefire line of control dividing the Himalayan region into a permanent border was one option that had existed for years.</p>
<p>The Indian government recently distanced itself from the proposal after Abdullah said the plan could be the blueprint for a permanent resolution of problems with Pakistan.</p>
<p>The two countries have fought two of their three wars since 1947 over Kashmir.</p>
<p>New Delhi regards the whole of the region as an integral part of the Indian union. Islamabad wants the predominantly Moslem Kashmiris to decide in a U.N.-mandated plebiscite whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu-majority India.</p>
