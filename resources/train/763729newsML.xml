<p>Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici said, just hours before details of a U.S. budget deal were expected to be announceed, that the pact would include $24 billion for childrens' healthcare and most likely a 15-cent per-pack cigarette tax.</p>
<p>&quot;We had to agree to the $24 billion in child heathcare but the Senate had already agreed to that and I think that is a good cause as long as the money is spent right,&quot; he said in an interview on Cable News Network &quot;Moneyline&quot; television program.  </p>
<p>When asked if the U.S. cigarette tax would increase by 20 cents a pack, Domenici said: &quot;It's not going to be that high...I think the number that is out is 15 (cents) and we don't start it for a year or two.&quot;</p>
<p>A Republican source told Reuters that the cigarette tax will rise by up to 15 cents a pack over the next five years under the new budget agreement that Congress and the Clinton administration hope to reach Monday night.</p>
<p>Domenici also said a capital gains tax cut has been worked out and &quot;will be a little bit better than everyone is reporting.&quot; An immediate capital gains tax cut to 20 percent from 28 percent is expected, with a drop to 18 percent in 2001 for investments held more than five years.</p>
