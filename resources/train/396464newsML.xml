<p>Feyenoord missed the chance of going level with PSV Eindhoven at the top of the Dutch first division on Sunday when they were beaten 3-0 at arch-rivals Ajax Amsterdam.</p>
<p>It left PSV, 2-1 home winners over AZ Alkmaar on Saturday, on 51 points, three ahead of Feyenoord with Twente Enschede in third place on 46.</p>
<p>On a brand new pitch, the fifth surface laid since Ajax's new Arena stadium was opened last year, the home side outclassed a rugged Feyenoord who had Argentine midfielder Pablo Sanchez sent off late in the game for an off-the-ball butting incident.</p>
<p>Ajax, with 36 points and no real chance of defending their league title, looked to be back in form ahead of their European Cup quarter-final against Atletico Madrid in 10 days time.</p>
<p>In an entertaining match, Nigerian Tijani Babangida opened the scoring after just three minutes, punishing a defensive slip to slot home past Ed de Goey.</p>
<p>Feyenoord, seeking their first win in Amsterdam for 10 years and missing Patricio Graf and Henk Fraser at the heart of defence, went further behind on the stroke of half-time when AC Milan-bound Patrick Kluivert turned Ronald Koeman inside out before rifling home a left-footed shot.</p>
<p>Finn Jari Litmanen rounded off the victory two minutes from time with delightful lob from 20 metres. But the late stages of the game were soured with Sanchez's dismissal for head-butting Kiki Musampa.</p>
<p>Police made 11 arrests, mainly Ajax fans, before the game and Dutch television reported that some Feyenoord supporters had started a small fire inside the Arena after the game.</p>
<p>In their game on Saturday, PSV took an 11th minute lead through a solo effort by 20-year-old winger Boudewijn Zenden. Wim Jonk made it 2-0 from the penalty spot in the 65th minute, while Hans Gillhaus scored a consolation goal for AZ.</p>
<p>Twente Enschede beat Graafschap Doetinchem 2-1 while, at the bottom of the table, RKC Waalwijk won 3-1 against last placed NEC Nijmegen, whose fans staged a mini invasion of the pitch to vent their frustrations.</p>
<p>It enabled Waalwijk to move above Groningen who were second from last after being thrashed 6-1 by Vitesse Arnhem whose Greek striker Nikolas Mahlas netted four goals in a 30-minute blitz.</p>
