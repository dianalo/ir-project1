<p>British glassmaker Pilkington Plc warned on Tuesday that its profits had been hit by poor European markets and the strong pound, triggering plans for significant job cuts in Germany.</p>
<p>It said profits for the year to March 31, 1997 would be well below market forecasts but would not be below 130 million pounds ($210.1 million) before tax and exceptional charges. That compares with an average forecast of 178 million in profits.</p>
<p>The news hit Pilkington shares and those of other major British building materials companies with high exposure in Germany, where demand for building products has fallen as the economy remains slack and unemployment ballooned to a post-war high.</p>
<p>At 1245 GMT, Pilkington was down nine pence at 119 1/2. Redland Plc, which gets 40 percent of its sales from Germany and is due to report its results on Thursday, fell 10 1/2 pence to 348.</p>
<p>RMC Group Plc, with similar German exposure, fell 16 1/2 pence to 953 1/2 pence per share. BPB Plc was down five and a half pence at 333.</p>
<p>Andrew Robb, finance director, told Reuters that Pilkington was already in talks with German unions about the closure of processing and double glazing plants to cut capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite a number will be taken out,&quot; he said. &quot;In Germany there will be a significant number of job losses.&quot;</p>
<p>Pilkington employs 9,000 people in Germany. Robb said today's announced job cuts were in addition to the planned 1,900 company-wide job cuts reported last year.</p>
<p>The group blamed weak market conditions in Europe, citing a sluggish Germany in particular. Last October's price hikes in float glass had not been sustainable and sales of processed products were also under pressure.</p>
<p>The pound's surge against other European currencies was a factor which squeezed profits further, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result  ongoing restructuring costs of close to 20 million pounds per annum will be borne in the next two years, twice the level previously indicated,&quot; Pilkington chairman Nigel Rudd said</p>
<p>A one-off provision of 40 million pounds will also be made against this year's results to cover asset write-offs but the company does not expect total charges to top 55 million this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Primarily it has been European market conditions and glass prices. Sterling has cost us around 10 million (pounds off pretax profits) this year,&quot; Robb told Reuters.</p>
<p>Pilkington's building product sales for Europe stand at 1.1 billion per annum, with 800 million for continental Europe alone of which Germany is the biggest market.</p>
<p>The finance chief said Europe was suffering from roughly 10 percent over capacity in building glass products -- a problem made worse by low demand in the winter months.</p>
<p>In a bid to improve profitability, Pilkington has launched new price hikes of &quot;at least 20 percent&quot; in the hope that at least some of it will stick.</p>
<p>One market dealer remained sanguine about the future. &quot;We are at the bottom of the trough. Things can only get better,&quot; he said.</p>
