<p>Gunmen killed 21 worshippers at a Sunni Moslem mosque in Pakistan on Monday and a militant Shi'ite Moslem leader was shot dead in a nearby town.</p>
<p>Three attackers fired automatic rifles at Al-Khair mosque in the central city of Multan during dawn prayers, killing 21 people and wounding dozens, many of them boys studying at a Koranic school attached to the mosque, ambulance workers said.</p>
<p>The assailants escaped in a car driven by an accomplice.</p>
<p>Troops later patrolled the area in armoured carriers and enforced an undeclared curfew to quell unrest after angry crowds fought police and stoned Shi'ite neighbourhoods, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&quot;The people are understandably very agitated,&quot; said police deputy superintendent Mirza Maqbool Beg at the scene.</p>
<p>Shops in the city, in the populous province of Punjab, were shut and many fearful residents stayed at home.</p>
<p>Shahid Ansari, a local councillor in Multan, said his father had been in the mosque, but had escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>&quot;He told me that as soon as the worshippers kneeled in prayer, the gunmen opened up with automatic weapons, firing from three sides,&quot; he said. &quot;The shooting went on for five minutes and there was blood and bits of flesh all over the mosque.&quot;</p>
<p>Hours later, gunmen on a motorcyle killed Mumtaz-ul-Hassan, local head of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) group, on his way to evening prayers in Bahawalpur, 95 km (60 miles) south of Multan, Shi'ite sources said.</p>
<p>It was the second murder of a militant Shi'ite leader in Bahawalpur in as many days. On Sunday night, gunmen killed Qamar Haider, a local leader of the Sipah-i-Mohammad Pakistan group.</p>
<p>Hardline Sunni and Shi'ite groups have long waged a bloody feud in Pakistan, whose mainly Sunni population of 130 million has a Shi'ite minority of about 15 percent.</p>
<p>In Karachi, a spokesman for the radical Sunni Sipah-i-Sahaba (SSP) group blamed the TJP for the Multan mosque attack.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not my suspicion. I am sure that it was TJP men who killed the innocent worshippers,&quot; Tariq Madni, the SSP's information secretary, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;This is open terrorism. This is the height of cowardice,&quot; he said, describing the victims as innocent Sunni Moslems.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them may have been supporters of the SSP but they were not party members,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He urged Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government to act against the culprits to prevent more sectarian bloodshed.</p>
<p>TJP leaders could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Bhutto's government is already reeling from Friday's killing of her estranged younger brother Murtaza, 42, and six of his followers in a clash between his guards and police in Karachi.</p>
