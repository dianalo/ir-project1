<p>White sugar futures clambered higher as players made use of the little time remaining before the spot March expiry to roll positions forward and square their books, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>March/May was actively traded and offered out to around $3.60 after closing at $2.70/3.20 bid/offer and accounted for a healthy chunk of the overall volume.</p>
<p>Traders said some major players had moved between buy and sell sides, noting that one trade house was a good afternoon seller after bidding March at around $300 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>The trade selling was countered by steady buying from a commission house which featured as a persistent seller earlier late last week and also on Monday, they said.</p>
<p>At 1705 GMT March stood $1.30 firmer at $304.90 and May was up 70 cents at $301.30. A hefty crossed against actuals trade of 730 lots on March boosted the overall volume of 3,349 lots.</p>
<p>Limited activity was also noted on the May/August spread and the widening March arbitrage attracted some selling interest as it moved over stops set around $71.</p>
<p>Traders noted the declining open position on March and said a large physical delivery against the contract was looking less likely. European Union and Polish sugars are expected to be tendered, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;But with everyone playing about with the March/May it could still throw it all over the place,&quot; said one, forecasting about two cargoes as the total delivery.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the market was heading towards a break of one of two trendlines, at which point the direction of the next few sessions would be decided.</p>
<p>A bearish trendline in place since the September high of $342.50 is about to meet an upward line created after last month's trough of $293.50.</p>
<p>The Paris market also saw solid turnover but price movements were realtively tight. March was up 50 cents at $305.20 and May down 30 cents at $300.90.</p>
<p>Matif volume totalled 2,166 lots.</p>
