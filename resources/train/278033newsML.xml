<title>USA: Stowaways extracted from container in Miami.</title>

<p>Fifteen stowaways from the Dominican Republic had to be extracted from a container on a cargo ship that docked at Miami, U.S. immigration officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Rescue workers on Thursday cut a hole through the top of the container because its doors were blocked by other cargo, Immigration and Naturalisation Service spokesman Lemar Wooley said. &quot;The container was opened like a sardine can,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Seven of the stowaways were taken to a hospital but were later returned to the ship, the Seaboard Voyager, which left Miami on Friday with 12 of the stowaways back on board. Under maritime law they are the ship's reponsibility.</p>
<p>One man who previously had been deported from the United States was being held in custody and authorities were caring for two 17-year-old boys, Wooley said. The journey from a port just west of Santo Domingo usually takes about a week.</p>
