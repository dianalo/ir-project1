<title>GERMANY: German forwarders see high Euro costs, more competition.</title>

<p>The costs of a single European currency could run to millions of marks for German freight forwarders, a large forwarder warned.</p>
<p>Guenter Peters, director of Thyssen Haniel Logistic GmbH (THL), warned the switch to the Euro in 1999-2002 could reach two percent of turnover, or one million marks for a forwarder with 50 million marks turnover.</p>
<p>Currency union could also see German forwarders face increasing competition from foreign rivals as German companies demanded more European logistics services for a wider market, he forecast.</p>
<p>Peters was speaking at a conference on European currency union and the forwarding industry organised by the German forwarders association BSL and the Frankfurt chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;The big firms will have a &quot;Go West&quot; policy and will increasingly use workers who are not in Germany,&quot; he warned in reference to re-location of production sites in other European countries.</p>
<p>THL had employed 20 additional computer staff in Germany, where it used six different computer systems in various divisions, to manage the Euro switch, Peters said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a long way from being ready and I am sure other competitors are not ready either. We have covered perhaps 20-30 percent of the preparations.'</p>
<p>Hans-Peter Immel, Kuehne &amp; Nagel central Germany director said forwarders would need to become more logistics and supply chain-orientated and work more closely with industry on questions of production locations, storage and distribution.</p>
<p>He dismissed fears of high Euro change-over costs and described the &quot;Go West&quot; factor as a question of production costs and nothing to do with the Euro itself.</p>
<p>Kuehne would introduce invoicing in Euros from January 1,1999, as large clients would also switch to the new currency at the same time and require suppliers such as forwarders to follow.</p>
<p>But since Euro notes would first be circulated freely from January 1, 2002, Kuehne would operate both Euro and national currencies in parallel for a three-year transition period in currency union countries, he added. --Reuters Air Cargo Service Tel+ 44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017 -www.racs.com</p>
