<p>Swedish soccer club IFK Gothenberg have bought Robert Andersson from Halmstad BK for six million crowns ($748,000) ($748,000), the highest ever transfer fee in Sweden for a Swedish player, newspapers said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tabloid Expressen said negotiations over Andersson, 26, started three weeks ago and were finalised on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Halmstad chairman Stig Nilsson said the club had earlier turned down an offer of three million crowns ($374,000) from a German club for Andersson whose contract does not run out until the end of this year but this price was too good to miss.</p>
<p>Andersson's first match in his three-year contract with Gothenberg will be on August 10 when the western Swedish team meets Vasteras.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's better to play in Gothenberg than to sit on the benches in Germany,&quot; Andersson told Expressen.</p>
<p>&quot;If I am lucky Gothenberg could be a springboard for a professional career,&quot; he told Sweden's other national tabloid, Aftonbladet.</p>
<p>Sweden's previous highest transfer fee was a two million crown ($248,667) payment by Gothenberg for Niclas Andersson of Halmstad.</p>
