<text>
<p>U.S. Midwest cash hog prices Friday were seen steady-firm in the eastern Corn Belt and steady-weak in the western Belt, depending on local packer demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most meat packers, with the exception of a major procesosor in the eastern Belt, were not planning Saturday slaughter because of weak operating margins, they said.</p>
<p>Top prices for hogs delivered to the plant in Iowa and southern Minnesota were seen steady and could range $57.00 to $58.00 per cwt. However, prices could trend lower if pork prices continue to weaken, the dealers said.  </p>
<p>Illionis hog prices at the plant also were called steady and could range $56.00 to $57.00. Indiana/Ohio hog prices at the plant were projected steady-firm and could range $56.00 to $56.50, possibly $57.00, they said.</p>
<p>Fresh loin prices at midday were quoted steady to $4.00 per cwt lower and hams were $3.00 lower, according to USDA. Bellies and lean trimmings were not established. There were 26.0 loads of pork and 6.0 loads of pork trimmings sold.</p>
