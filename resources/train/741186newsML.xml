<title>USA: Cunanan ruled out in Miami doctor slaying.</title>
<headline>Cunanan ruled out in Miami doctor slaying.</headline>
<dateline>MIAMI 1997-07-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Police said on Saturday they had made an arrest in connection with the murder of a Miami doctor earlier this week but ruled out any link to alleged multiple killer Andrew Cunanan.</p>
<p>Cunanan is sought for the July 15 murder of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace and four other killings. Police had been examining the doctor's murder to see if Cunanan might have been involved.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will have a press conference announcing the closure in the homicide investigation of Dr. Silvio Alfonso. An arrest has been made,&quot; police said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The subject arrested is not Andrew Cunanan.&quot;</p>
<p>Alfonso was found strangled in his Miami Springs home, just north of Miami's international airport, on Thursday.</p>
<p>FBI and police hunting Cunanan took away evidence from the scene after a man described as resembling Cunanan was seen running from the scene but later played down any connection with the Versace slaying.</p>
