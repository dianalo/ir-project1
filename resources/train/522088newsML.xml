<p>Thailand, hit by a serious shortage of local coal to fuel its rapidly growing heavy industry, is being forced to import large quantities to meet rising demand, industry analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The biggest coal users in the steel, cement, power and paper mills have no alternative but to depend on imports to keep their machines running, they told Reuters.</p>
<p>Coal is probably the most popular energy source in Thailand now because it is much cheaper to use than electricity, fuel oil or gas, they said.</p>
<p>Thailand's demand for electricity and fuel oil also outstrips supplies, necessitating expensive imports. Electricity is imported from Laos and oil from the Middle East, industry experts said.</p>
<p>Although imported coal costs more than local lignite, its lower sulphur content made it more attractive due to the lower investment needed in desulfurisation equipment, Asian Equity Ltd said in a recent report.</p>
<p>Prachuab Trinikorn, senior vice president of local coal firm Banpu Plc, said major exporters of bituminous coal, used as substitute for local lignite, included Indonesia, China and Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;This year's imports from those three countries are expected to soar to about four million tonnes.&quot;</p>
<p>Total imports from the three countries nearly doubled last year over that 1995 and totalled about three million tonnes valued at about 3.6 billion baht ($138.46 million).</p>
<p>Prachuab said domestic coal demand was expected to increase to 15 million tonnes a year by 2005. Of that only two to three million tonnes would be from local sources, mostly mined at the northern province of Lampang.</p>
<p>While Thai economic planners were trying to find new sources for coal or using other minerals as substitutes, Banpu had acquired a coal mine in Indonesia's Kalimantan region to keep supplies going, he added.</p>
<p>The mine would produce two million tonnes a year starting from either late this year early 1998. Estimates from an initial exploration confirmed more than 20 years of production, he said.</p>
<p>Seventy percent of total production would be exported to Thailand while the remaining would be sold in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The firm has also been negotiating with the Burmese government to explore for lignite there, but so far has made no progress due to stringent local laws and the occupation of some potential mining areas by ethnic rebels. ($1=26.08)</p>
