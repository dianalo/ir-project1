<p>A former minister and close confidant of ex-prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia has resigned from the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), party sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Retired Major-General Majedul Huq, former minister of agriculture, irrigation and water resources, handed two letters of resignation on Thursday to Khaleda Zia and BNP's secretary-general, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, the sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am quitting for my own reasons. I will continue to work for the BNP,&quot; the Sangbad newspaper quoted him on Friday as saying.</p>
<p>The June election returned Awami League to power 21 years after it was ousted in a 1975 military coup that killed Bangladesh's independence leader, Sheikh Mjibur Rahman, along with most of his family.</p>
<p>Mujib's daughter and political heir, Sheikh Hasina, took over as prime minister on June 23.</p>
