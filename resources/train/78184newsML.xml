<headline>Slovenian shares surge as optimism resurfaces.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1996-09-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slovenian shares soared 3.55 percent on Thursday and traders expect further gains due to renewed optimism following the strong performance of shares of newly privatised companies.</p>
<p>&quot;What we hoped for happened. Shares of newly privatised firms like Lek, Kolinska and Droga managed to pull the market up very strongly and I expect this to continue over the next week or two,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>* The seven-share SBI index rose 32.98 points to 962.84.</p>
<p>* 20 shares rose and one fell, while three were untraded.</p>
<p>* Turnover rose to 395.9 million tolars from 216.6 million.</p>
<p>* Drug company Lek's A issue was the most actively traded, jumping 7.1 percent to 18,900 tolars on volume of 8,692 shares for total turnover of 161.6 million tolars.</p>
<p>* Financial consultancy Primofin was the top gainer, surging 8.3 percent to 16,250 on volume of 26 shares for total turnover of 0.4 million tolars.</p>
<p>* Preferred shares of trader Kovinotehna were the leading decliners, shedding 1.22 percent to 405 on volume of 735 shares for total turnover of 0.3 million tolars.</p>
<p>* Although the bourse said today it decided to ban brokerage Dadas from trading for six months, accusing it of rigging prices, shares of financial consultancy Dadas, the owner of the brokerage, closed 7.5 percent higher. They rose to 15,770 on volume of 372 shares for total turnover of 5.4 million tolars.</p>
<p>Traders said Dadas rose because it had already bottomed out on September 9 when it fell 53 percent to 12,811 in one day on rumours the brokerage may be banned from trading. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
