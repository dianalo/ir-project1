<p>Iran on Saturday called Madeleine Albright, nominated as President Bill Clinton's next Secretary of State, an &quot;unsuccessful diplomat&quot; known for her hostile policies against the world of Islam and Iran.</p>
<p>It was widely believed she was an advocate of aggressive foreign policy and U.S. intervention in various parts of the world, the official Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the Persian-language daily Iran as saying in an editorial.</p>
<p>It said she was taking the position at a time when Washington's foreign policy was in disarray and the White House was facing a wide range of problems and deadlocks in the world.</p>
<p>Albright had to start tackling a variety of issues such as problems in U.S.-Europe relations, confrontations and rivalry in the American continent, the massive and costly presence of the U.S. in various parts of the world, increasing problems in the African continent and the Middle East crisis.</p>
<p>A review of U.S. foreign policy and the reasons for repeated White House defeats in international relations were important enough to take up much of the time and energy of Clinton's new foreign policy team, Iran said.</p>
<p>Other cases before the new secretary of state included unsuccessful U.S.-Israeli cooperation and the nearly two-decade hostility of the U.S. administration against the people of Iran.</p>
<p>Albright inevitably had to clarify her position on these issues, it added.</p>
