<p>Soccer star Diego Maradona backed down on Thursday from a threat to reveal murky &quot;political and economic interests&quot; behind his manager's arrest on cocaine dealing charges, and promised to keep quiet.</p>
<p>The hero of Argentina's 1986 World Cup title, himself a cocaine addict, made a veiled apology to the judge who had his manager, Guillermo Coppola, arrested after police found a pound (500 grams) of cocaine in a flower pot at his apartment.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust in the justice system and especially Judge Hernan Bernasconi and will cooperate fully to clear up the matter he is investigating and avoid making his job more difficult,&quot; the 36-year-old player said in a statement put out by his lawyers.</p>
<p>A day earlier Maradona had published an open letter in the press vowing to &quot;head a campaign to make all those responsible for this injustice pay,&quot; and reveal &quot;hidden dark political and economic interests&quot; behind Coppola's arrest and imprisonment.</p>
<p>Maradona's silver-haired 49-year-old manager and close friend, arrested two weeks ago along with Maradona's brother-in-law Gabriel Esposito, ex-soccer international Alberto Tarantini and others, insisted the drugs were planted.</p>
<p>Coppola told the judge that after he left his home for the last time during a party the Saturday before the raid, Maradona and three women partied there until late on Sunday.</p>
<p>Maradona, due to give evidence next week, said he had kept quiet since the case began and would resume his silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Diego never meant to sound threatening and after the last communique was issued, Diego understood its tone was not what he intended,&quot; his lawyer Daniel Bolotnicoff told reporters. He described Maradona as &quot;very distressed&quot; at Coppola's plight.</p>
<p>Maradona, once the world's most expensive player but in decline since a 15-month drugs ban after the U.S. World Cup, has not played for Buenos Aires' Boca Juniors since August.</p>
<p>He is very fond of Coppola, but many Argentines blame the playboy manager for Maradona's drug habit, which put him in a Swiss clinic for 10 days last month. Days later he went berserk in a Spanish hotel and smashed up the lobby.</p>
<p>The case was embarrassing the Argentine government. Coppola not only visited President Carlos Menem's Olivos residence with Maradona, but was a friend of Menem's late son Carlitos and Menem's private secretary Ramon Hernandez.</p>
