<title>PORTUGAL: Portuguese bond report.</title>
<headline>Portuguese bond report.</headline>
<dateline>LISBON 1997-08-18</dateline>

<p>Bonds closed near their day's highs, lifted by the foreign trend and the unexpected 20 basis point rates cut by the Bank of Portugal.</p>
<p>Traders saw the longer end following the Bunds, with some seeing the possibility of a slight tightening of the spread.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate cut gave support along the curve...73 basis points (10-year spread) is exaggerated taking account of the signal about convergence given by the Bank today,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>But traders said that on Tuesday all attention will be on what type of repo the Bundesbank offers and then on the Federal Reserve meeting set for later in the day.  </p>
<p>Most traders were betting on no rate move by the Fed although there was some uncertainty regarding the decision of the Bundesbank. Traders said that the rate cut by the Bank of Portugal opened the door to gains at the shorter end of the curve where the spread with Germany remains wide.</p>
<p>The spread widened only slightly between Portugal's two and the 10 year bonds to 106 from 105 basis points.</p>
<p>Money market yields eased slightly, with the tom/next dipping to 5.45/50 percent from 5.50/65 at the opening on Monday, with some traders seeing room for further falls.</p>
