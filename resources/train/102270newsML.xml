<headline>Mexico's Pemex says building its own yield curve.</headline>

<p>Petroleos Mexicanos said its placement of a $300 million, three-year Eurobond on Tuesday is the latest step in its strategy of building its own yield curve in the Eurobond market.</p>
<p>Analysts said that, with oil prices high and better sentiment for emerging market paper, Pemex had tapped the market at the right time.</p>
<p>It was the third time this year the state-owned oil company has gone to the Eurobond market.  </p>
<p>&quot;The last three placements from Pemex in the Euro market underline the company's strategy to gradually and appropriately construct its own yield curve,&quot; Pemex said in a statement.</p>
<p>In March, Pemex said it had placed a two-year Italian lira issue worth about $193 million, adding that it had become the first Mexican debt issuer to tap that market in a major way.</p>
<p>In June, it launched another bond, this time a two-year, $300 million issue, with a yield of 190 basis points over U.S. treasuries.  </p>
<p>Pemex said then it had broken through the important 200 basis points over Treasuries psychological barrier.</p>
<p>Analysts said there has been strong demand for new issues from Mexico in general as it benefits from sympathetic feelings overall for emerging markets.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the belief that Mexico and the Philippines, some of the stronger rated emerging markets, could be upgraded some time in the near future after the good ratings that Russia got,&quot; said Steve Boyajian, global director of technical analysis for MMS International.  </p>
<p>On Monday, Russia received a better than expected credit ratings for its foreign currency debt.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, the Mexican federal government upped its 1.0 billion mark issue to 1.5 billion marks.</p>
<p>Pemex has also benefitted from high oil prices and the belief there will be a steady stream of revenues to pay off any of its bonds, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue was launched in response to an increase in demand for short-term debt paper out of Latin America...,&quot; Pemex said.  </p>
<p>Analysts said that Pemex's June placement -- a three-year issue -- might offer a better bet than the newest issue since it had a similar, or even better spread than the new issue.</p>
<p>Analysts added that Pemex paper was fairly illiquid.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly there is a bit of a liquidity value of a new bond and with the oil price run-up it has probably created some strong demand, but there is no reason why an off the run should be priced even anywhere close to it (the June issue),&quot; said Boyajian.</p>
<p>In September this year, Pemex also renewed its U.S. commercial paper program, upping the amount to $500 million from the originally scheduled $400 million.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Finance Ministry said Pemex would have about $800 million worth of paper coming due in 1997.</p>
