<p>Egypt share prices extended on Monday a seven-day streak of record highs.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index closed at 324.78 points, up 2.34 points on 322.44 points at Sunday's close. Volume was 50.37 million pounds ($14.81 million).</p>
<p>&quot;It's booming,&quot; said Neveen al-Tahry of Delta EAB. &quot;There is more money coming in on expectations of prices going up.&quot;</p>
<p>Commercial International Bank (CIB) led in terms of turnover when 6.6 million pounds of its shares changed hands.</p>
<p>CIB turnover was high on expectations of a 10-for-one share split, Tahry said. &quot;It means much more will be available for people. It's the best performing bank on the market,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>But its share price fell 68 pounds to close at 600.</p>
<p>&quot;The stock market board imposed a ceiling on CIB after it found the share went too high,&quot; Elwi Taymour of EFG/Hermes said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're still capping it (CIB),&quot; Tahry said. &quot;The only thing that seems to have relaxed is the housing sector which was flying the past few days.&quot;</p>
<p>The two big privatised real estate companies, Medinet Nasr Housing and Development and Heliopolis Housing and Development, have been trailblazing in the market in the past few days but their shares eased on Monday.</p>
<p>Medinet Nasr shares fell 23 pounds to 437 in 3.8 million pounds turnover, the third highest of the day. Heliopolis was down 30 pounds to close at 570 in 2.3 million pounds turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all active shares went up except Heliopolis and Medinet Nasr, mainly because of profit-taking. We are still recommending the two shares,&quot; Taymour said.</p>
<p>Taymour said the cement sector was in strong demand and milling shares picked up. Some mills had slipped back before the latest run of increases.</p>
<p>Shams Housing and Development was the day's biggest gainer when its shares rose 24.30 percent to close at 22.25. The firm published its profitable balance sheet in Monday's newspaper.</p>
<p>The CMAindex for openly traded firms rose to 511.01 from 507.79 points on Monday and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 222.32 from 220.6.</p>
<p>Out of 70 shares traded, 33 advanced, 16 declined and the other 21 ended the day unchanged.</p>
