<p>NEARBY MONTH CLOSE * SUPPORT * RESIST  * RSI-14 * MA-10 * MA-20</p>

<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - JULY 2 ---------------</p>
<p>*   The market closed above the 40-day moving average at $18.74 on Tuesday and will look for initial support here and then at $18.50.</p>
<p>*   Momentum indicators continue to point the market higher though there is some strong resistance to break down before $19, which marks a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement, can be achieved.</p>
<p>The uptrend for IPE Brent crude looks set to continue though its pace may be slowed for a while with bearish chart formations on gas oil possibly flagging the end of its recent surge, analysts said.</p>
<p>Darren Gurner, analyst at Sucden, said, &quot;In the short term supports for Brent look good and in the longer term I think we will see $19.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the market closed above the 40-day moving average at $18.74 on Tuesday and would look for initial support here and then at $18.50. But he said momentum indicators continued to point the market higher though there was some strong resistance to break down before $19, which marks a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement, would be hit.</p>
<p>&quot;If it gets through $19 the market could be on the road to recovery, $19.50 is psychological but after this there is very little resistance to $20,&quot; Gurner said.</p>
<p>Al Graham at Elliott Wave International, Gainesville, Florida warned of a &quot;massive wall of resistance&quot; that is thought to reside between $19.02 and $19.37 and he took a bearish longer-term view.</p>
<p>&quot;Dropping under $18.45 makes the case that projected weakness is underway, while breaking $18.67 support is a solid indication that the weakness is likely to progress,&quot; Graham said.</p>
<p>However, an expanding triangle formation on the August chart flags continuation of the current trend, but analysts are still looking for confirmation that the market can sustain recent gains.</p>
<p>&quot;There may initially be some correction on crude if gas oil turns tail and head lower, but good supports are now in place at the mid to lower $18 level,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market remains bullish for the short term but needs to keep its upside momentum rolling forward in order to avoid triggering a sharp sell-off if confidence runs out.</p>
<p>Gas oil continued to strengthen on Tuesday after breaking down resistance at $167.25 the top of a gap down earlier in the month to close at $167.75. The next target could be the $179.50 high from mid-May, but analysts said the narrow trading ranges over the last few days may mean the market is running out of steam to the upside.</p>
<p>Using Japanese candlestick charting techniques a &quot;hanging man&quot; pattern, where the bulk of trade was toward the top of the daily range, at this point could be signalling the end of the recent rally.</p>
<p>Graham said, &quot;Expect prices to fall under 158 from little, if any, above $171.50-$172 and probably starting within a day or so.&quot;</p>
<p>August Brent on SIMEX was trading around $18.65 per barrel, after London settled 29 cents higher at $18.80.</p>
<p>On ACCESS NYMEX  crude valued around $20.02, down 10 cents from the New York close where the contract gained 32 cents to settle at $20.12 a barrel.</p>
