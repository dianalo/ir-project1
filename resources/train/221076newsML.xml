<p>Miami Mayor Joe Carollo told Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles the city's deficit is worse than previously disclosed, and that he would welcome a state takeover of the city, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mayor Joe Carollo spoke to the newspaper late Tuesday night, after returning from what he described as &quot;a heart to heart&quot; with Chiles in Tallahassee.</p>
<p>Carollo said he and Chiles also discussed the possibility of declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 9, but that going into bankruptcy now would be premature. A bankruptcy declaration would allow the city to nullify union contracts, renegotiate city leases, privatize garbage services and restructure debt payments.</p>
<p>Carollo said he believes Miami's deficit is much worse than the previously estimated $68 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The deficit is much greater. There are additional millions. We really don't know where they are,&quot; the newspaper quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Neither city officials nor the governor were immediately available for comment Wednesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Carollo also formally notified Chiles that the city had a &quot;financial emergency,&quot; which the city declared on Oct 7.</p>
<p>The declaration could allow the governor to appoint a financial emergency board to take over fiscal management of the city, something no Florida governor has ever done.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not at all opposed to having an advisory board,&quot; Carollo told the newspaper. &quot;If anything it might be refreshing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When New York went thorugh its problems, the governor there put in an oversight board and look at New York -- it came back stronger than ever. We need to rebuild Miami top to bottom and change the Third World system that was running this city for so long, Carollo told the Herald.</p>
