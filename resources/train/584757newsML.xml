<p>Jakarta stocks were lower in early trading on Wednesday following profit-taking in both small and big-cap stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta composite index fell 3.12 points, or 0.46 percent, to 669.74 points at 0335 GMT. Decliners led advancers by 55 to 29 with 47 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Total turn-over was estimated at 131 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;The correction had been expected after some rises in the index and the Dow's fall overnight,&quot; one broker said.  </p>
<p>Losers included big-caps Barito Pacific, Citra Marga and Bank BNI due to profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bakrie Land Development, formerly known as Elang Realty, remained among the most active, with some 31 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Bakrie Land fell 75 rupiah to 1,825 rupiah as players took profit following recent rises, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bakrie Land has been among the most actively traded stocks recently after reports that the firm planned to propose a rights issue, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The firm was also rumoured to acquire the assets of an affiliated property firm PT Bakrie Kapitalindo, brokers said.</p>
<p>Property firm Modern Land was actively traded, but it fell 50 rupiah to 3,825 rupiah due to profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>Big-cap Indosat fell 50 rupiah to 7,350 rupiah, but volumes were small as only 71,500 shares were traded despite announcement of a rise in the firm's first quarter results, brokers said. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
