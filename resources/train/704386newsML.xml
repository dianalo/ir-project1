<headline>New EU draft gas directive due in weeks - official.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-03</dateline>

<p>A new draft of the European Union's gas directive is due within weeks and may be approved by the year's end, the head of the Gas Unit at the European Commission's Energy Directorate-General said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Patrick Lambert told a British Parliamentary Committee that the new Luxembourg presidency of the EU is likely to produce its own draft version of the gas directive shortly.</p>
<p>There would &quot;very probably&quot; be an emergency meeting of the Energy Council in October and a regular meeting was planned for December 8, he said.</p>
<p>The gas directive will establish rules for opening markets across the European Union to competition, and follows the electricity directive agreed last year.</p>
<p>Lambert said progress was being made on the gas directive's date but the current draft does not specify the rate at which the market will open.</p>
<p>A previous draft included a Dutch proposal that the market open in stages, with users of 25 million cubic metres a year (mmcm/yr) or more first to have the right to buy gas competitively.</p>
<p>The threshold would then fall in a second stage to users of 10 mmcm/yr or more and finally should fall after 10 years to users of over 1 mmcm/yr.</p>
<p>But specific numbers are no longer in the current draft, Lambert told the House of Lords European Communities subcommittee on energy, industry and transport.</p>
<p>He said the draft's main features were already in place but it has not yet been finalised and was still evolving, with &quot;one draft following another in rapid succession.&quot;</p>
<p>Whil accepting the directive would be a compromise he denied differences between liberalisers and protectionists were so wide as to make the directive &quot;a nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On several occasions all member states have agreed they need a gas directive,&quot; he said. &quot;Only a year ago they agreed an electricity directive. We are near an agreement and all member states want an agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The two key areas still holding that agreement up are the level of market opening across the EU, and the issue of long term take or pay contracts, he said.</p>
<p>Take or pay contracts are long term gas contracts popular with producers, as they ensure that their gas will be sold, and with consumers, who have enhanced security of supply, but many could be considered anti-competitive.</p>
<p>Lambert said derogations to the directive for individual take or pay contracts would be considered but would be the exception, not the norm.</p>
