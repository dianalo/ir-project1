<headline>Heinz cutting 2,500 jobs, closing 25 plants.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1997-03-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>H.J. Heinz Co. unveiled its long-awaited restructuring plan Friday, saying it will close or sell at least 25 plants, cut 2,500 jobs worldwide and take a $650 million pretax charge to cover the costs.</p>
<p>Separately, Heinz announced record results for its fiscal third quarter.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-based global food marketer, which produces a wide variety of food products as well as its famous condiments, said it expected the cost-cutting measures to result in pretax savings of about $120 million next year.</p>
<p>Heinz said at a meeting of financial analysts in San Francisco it will exit at least four &quot;non-strategic&quot; businesses as part of the reorganization, the biggest in its history.</p>
<p>Heinz said its intention was to focus on expanding its global leadership in high-margin ketchup and condiments, tuna products and weight-control and other prepackaged foods.</p>
<p>The company -- whose brands include Heinz, StarKist, Ore-Ida, 9-Lives, Weight Watchers, Budget Gourmet, Earth's Best and Ken-L Ration -- said one of the first steps in the reorganization was the sale of its Ore-Ida food business to McCain Foods Ltd. of Canada for $500 million.</p>
<p>It added that it expected that cash proceeds from all the asset sales it contemplates over the next 12 months should realise between $750 million and $850 million.</p>
<p>The company said that, in all, it will close or sell at least 25 other plants throughout the world.</p>
<p>In addition, the company will reduce its global work force by 2,500 employees, or about 6 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret the loss of jobs, but this plan is necessary to make us more competitive in the tough global marketplace,&quot; Chairman Anthony J. F. O'Reilly told a meeting of the Security Analysts of San Francisco.</p>
<p>He added the specific plants and businesses to be closed will not be publicly identified until after affected employees have been notified in the next few months.</p>
<p>O'Reilly said the goals of the sweeping makeover included ensuring at least 10 percent earnings growth into the next century and increasing sales to between $14 billion and $15 billion by 2003, compared with $9.5 billion this year.</p>
<p>He also said the company intended to greatly increase its overseas sales from their current level of 43 percent of annual revenues.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the plan could have been more aggressive in terms of selling businesses but added it moved Heinz in the right direction toward focusing the company.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they should take more steps but I think they're going in the right direction,&quot; said John McMillin at Prudential Securities. &quot;They're juggling a lot of balls. It's not going to be easy.&quot;</p>
<p>While declining to elaborate, O'Reilly told Reuters after the meeting that Heinz will likely make acquisitions in the coming months in Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia that fit its growth strategy.</p>
<p>Heinz Friday also announced record results for its fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 29.</p>
<p>It said its net income climbed 11 percent to $174.4 million, or 47 cents a share, from $156.5 million, or 42 cents a share, as revenues grew 5 percent to $2.31 billion from $2.19 billion.</p>
<p>The earnings-per-share figure was exactly in line with Wall Street forecasts, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Heinz stock was unchanged at $41.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
