<p>European stock markets closed strongly on Wednesday as Wall Street led a collective sigh of relief that the U.S. Federal Reserve decided against raising interest rates, for the moment at least.</p>
<p>The dollar recovered most of its overnight losses against the mark and firmed against the yen as a sharp drop in the March U.S. trade deficit helped to offset some disappointment at the lack of an interest rate rise on Tuesday.</p>
<p>European share markets were already firm in the morning after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the policy arm of the U.S. central bank, said after the Tuesday close in Europe that its Fed Funds rate would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Wall Street then opened strongly, continuing a rally which began after the FOMC announcement, although it later lost most of the gains. By the European close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up only 5.36 points at 7,308.82.</p>
<p>European markets closed firm, albeit off the day's highs, despite some qualms among investors that the Fed had only postponed an interest rate rise until the summer.</p>
<p>Germany, which fell sharply on jitters before the FOMC meeting on Tuesday, was the biggest beneficiary. The DAX index, which closes before Wall Street opens, finished up 52.66 points or 1.49 percent at 3,596.09. The rise was more dramatic in electronic trade after the floor session, where the IBIS index surged 2.39 percent to 3,600.40.</p>
<p>&quot;If everything looked negative yesterday, it all looks positive now,&quot; said a Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>Buying focused on stocks in the news. Metals and chemicals firm Degussa AG remained among the favourites after utility Veba AG announced plans to buy a large stake in it at well above market value.</p>
<p>Degussa rose 8.80 marks to 84.80 marks, below the Veba buy price of 86.80 marks. Veba was up 90 pfennigs at 99.70.</p>
<p>In London the FTSE 100 index of blue chips closed up  34.5 points or 0.75 percent at 4,642.0 but was about 10 points below the day's high.</p>
<p>This was despite lingering worries that the FOMC, by delaying an interest rate hike now, would have to raise them by half a percentage point when it next meets in July, rather than the quarter point which some analysts had expected on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is riding this good news at the moment. We could see the FTSE hit a new high in the next few days,&quot; one senior dealer said. &quot;But it may end in tears in July.&quot;</p>
<p>Concerns are also focused on British rates before the new Labour government's first budget.</p>
<p>News of a slowdown in British broad money supply growth in April eased fears that the Bank of England might push up interest rates before Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's first budget speech.</p>
<p>Although no official date has been set, Brown is widely expected to unveil his spending plans on June 10.</p>
<p>The Paris market was also firmer following the Fed decision but again off the day's high due to profit taking. The CAC 40 index closed up 35.24 points or 1.28 percent at 2,786.35.</p>
<p>The dollar finished the European day in better shape than it started after an overnight fall when the interest rate rise predicted by some failed to materialise.</p>
<p>It was helped by U.S. trade figures for March which showed the deficit shrank 19.3 percent to $8.5 billion, well below market forecasts for a deficit of over $10 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar will find some relief in the overall decline in the deficit,&quot; said Robert Hayward, economist at Bank of America. However, analysts said dollar/mark was the most likely candidate to benefit longer-term and dollar/yen's bounce was more fragile.</p>
<p>The drop in the deficit masked an 8.3 percent rise in the bilateral trade gap with Japan, the sixth consecutive monthly rise. The dollar has plunged up to 14 percent this month against the yen from its highest level in 4-1/2 years.</p>
<p>This is due to speculation of higher Japanese interest rates, official U.S. concern about the Japanese trade surplus and a barrage of Japanese offiical comments aimed at preventing further yen weakness.</p>
<p>The dollar recovered to 114.30 yen in late European trading compared with 113.80 at the close on Tuesday. It was at 1.6940 marks after closing in Europe on Tuesday at 1.6953 and hitting a low later of just above 1.67.</p>
<p>STOCK PRICES AT CLOSE</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 closed up 34.5 points or 0.75 percent at 4,642.0</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index closed up 35.24 points or 1.28 percent at 2,786.35.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index closed up 52.66 points or 1.49 percent at 3,596.09. In later electronic trade, the IBIS index closed up 84.20 points or 2.39 percent to 3,600.40.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT CLOSE</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.6940 marks and 114.30 yen compared with 1.6953 marks and 113.80 yen in late European trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS AT CLOSE</p>
<p>Gold closed at $342.75 an ounce, unchanged from Tuesday's close in London. Silver was down one cent at $4.70.</p>
