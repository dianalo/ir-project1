<title>EGYPT: Egypt says Israel backed out of Cairo summit plan.</title>

<p>Israel pulled out of plans for a Middle East summit in Cairo last week because Egypt set conditions to ensure it would succeed, a senior Egyptian official said in an interview published on Thursday.</p>
<p>Osama el-Baz, political adviser to President Hosni Mubarak, also told the English-language newspaper al-Ahram Weekly that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suffered from &quot;a combination of ideological rigidity and a lack of experience&quot;.</p>
<p>A change in Israeli government policy would probably have to come through domestic pressure, he added.</p>
<p>Mubarak tried last week to arrange a meeting between Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat but his plans collapsed after U.S. President Bill Clinton joined in and announced plans for an alternative summit in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israelis wanted very much for Egypt to host the summit but they retreated after learning that Egypt is asking for certain requirements in order to guarantee the success of the conference,&quot; said Baz.</p>
<p>&quot;It's only natural that if you host a meeting you want certain indications it will be successful, because you are not a catering service. This is a political meeting....otherwise, there is no point,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Egyptian officials have faulted the United States for not making adequate preparations for the Washington summit, which ended on Wednesday without agreement on any substance.</p>
<p>Baz said the policies of the new Israeli government were a dead end. &quot;No Arab is going to accept them or tolerate them... No statesman can maintain this view, while seeing that the only thing it will lead to is bloodshed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a mistake for the Arabs to think of israel as a monolithic structure, that all (Israelis) are the same, because there are deep divisions inside Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;Israeli public opinion can force the new Israeli government to change its course because Israel cannot be pressured from abroad. It has to come from inside. What's important is that the government changes its course, not that it falls,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on Netanyahu's mentality, he said: &quot;It is a combination of ideological rigidity, a hard line which is expressed in certain logical terms from their point of view, and a lack of experience. It's not a question of political naivety, but a matter of not knowing how far things can go, what can work and what can't.&quot;</p>
