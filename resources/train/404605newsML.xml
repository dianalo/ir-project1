<p>Republican Ohio lawmakers on Wednesday introduced a bill that would enable the mayor of Cleveland to take over control of that city's public school system.</p>
<p>The bill, which reportedly faces opposition from ten of 11 state lawmakers representing voters in the school district, would substitute operational control of the schools by the mayor for the board of education, which would serve only in an advisory capacity.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposal that has had the most success and has worked in other majory school districts around the nation is the one that puts the control of the schools into the hands of the mayor,&quot; said State Rep. William Batchelder, R-Medina, in a news release. &quot;Cleveland deserves the chance to try this approach. Only Mayor Michael White has the resources or the political capital to held create meaningful reform.&quot;</p>
<p>Batchelder also pointed out a similar in Chicago has led to &quot;steadily improving&quot; schools in that city. He and State Rep. Michael Wise, R-Mayfield Village, are the chief sponsors of the Ohio bill.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for White was not available to comment on the bill's introduction.</p>
<p>Almost two years ago, continued budget deficits led the Ohio Department of Education to take control of the Cleveland school system. In October, Ohio Auditor Jim Petro declared a fiscal emergency for the district under a recently enacted law.</p>
