<headline>FOCUS - Dollar hits 56-month peak, boosts Euro stocks.</headline>

<p>The dollar traded at a 56-month peak against the yen on Wednesday and climbed against the mark, causing a sharp rebound in European bourses on improved export prospects.</p>
<p>Shares in Paris rose more than one percent, taking comfort from a healthy performance on Wall Street on Tuesday as well as the stronger dollar. London and Frankfurt also made hefty gains.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 126.45 yen by mid-morning, its highest level since August 1992, driven up by expectations of higher U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The past week has seen a few events that have given a green light to the FX market to push the dollar higher,&quot; said Ian Amstad, international economist at Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>The dollar, although up on Tuesday's European closing levels of 126.20, slipped from its its early high levels, with traders saying that sentiment remained bullish although some investors were getting jittery.</p>
<p>Dealers were focusing on U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers's testimony before a Senate subcommittee scheduled for 1400 GMT on Wednesday in the hope that he would make some reference to the dollar's recent rally.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning's been about buying on dips where you can. There are a few technicals suggesting the dollar is a bit overbought, so people are a bit nervous about driving it much higher now,&quot; said one trader at a British bank.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the U.S. currency climbed over half a pfennig as the mark came under pressure from recent data indicating little likelihood of a near-term rise in German interest rates.</p>
<p>The German currency was also undermined by growing talk that flexibility in interpreting the Maastricht criteria would see the European single currency go ahead on time. That is seen as bad news for a robust currency like the mark.</p>
<p>Sterling too was riding high on the dollar's rise and a strong bond market in Europe. It was at 2.7845 marks, compared with 2.7775 in late European trade yesterday.</p>
<p>The dollar helped boost equities. Frankfurt, which dropped 10 percent last week, gained 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is the major theme today but the fact that New York seems to be stabilised is also helping,&quot; a Frankfurt trader said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 53.25 points at 6,609.16.</p>
<p>The strong showing in New York, Wall Street's third consecutive rise, also gave Paris a leg-up. French stocks climbed 1.37 percent by mid-morning.</p>
<p>London's advance, at 0.44 precent, was more modest and reflected uncertainty over British interest rates and the May 1 election.</p>
<p>Many investors were also worried that the rally on Wall Street, which has climbed 132 points over the past three sessions, could prove shortlived.</p>
<p>&quot;If we have any earnings disappointments or bad economic data, the Dow will take it badly,&quot; one market-maker said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.7161 marks and 126.45 yen, up from 1.7103 and 126.20 in late European trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1130 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was up 18.8 points at 4,288.1.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was up 27.9 points at 3,357.75.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 index was up 35.58 points at 2,614.58.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed in the morning at $348.00 an ounce, comparted with the London close of $348.45 on Tuesday. Silver was at $4.79, barely changed.</p>
