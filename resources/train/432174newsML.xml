<title>USA: U.S. strongly backs new Mexican drug czar.</title>
<headline>U.S. strongly backs new Mexican drug czar.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States on Monday threw its support behind Mexico's new anti-drug czar and said the appointment strengthened President Bill Clinton's case for certifying Mexico as an ally in the war on drugs.</p>
<p>Clinton defended his Feb. 28 decision to certify Mexico and vowed to convince the U.S. Congress to back his position.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Zedillo named Mariano Herran Salvatti, a little known lawyer, to head Mexico's anti-narcotics effort. He replaces Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, who was abruptly jailed on charges he was in the pay of Mexico's top drug lord.</p>
<p>His arrrest was announced by Mexico on Feb. 18 as Clinton was weighing whether to re-certify Mexico as an ally in the drug war despite claims of corruption and lack of cooperation among Mexican law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The scandal caused an uproar in Washington, where members of Congress said it showed how far traffickers had penetrated the Mexican government. A U.S. House of Representatives committee voted last week to overturn Clinton's certification finding and the full House is to vote later this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to do my best to persuade the Congress that we're right,&quot; Clinton said at a joint White House news conference with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>Clinton said he believed the Mexican government was cooperating, noting the arrest of Gutierrez Rebollo.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the appointment of Herran Salvatti to succeed the jailed general should dispel any doubts about the decision to certify Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it's a highly significant appointment which ought to be welcomed by the detractors of our president's policy,&quot; Burns said. &quot;We have absolute trust and confidence in President Zedillo ... He has chosen this man personally.&quot;</p>
<p>Burns hoped the announcement &quot;will convince those in Congress and those around the country and perhaps even in our own hemisphere who have any doubts that President's Zedillo's commitment to wage the war against narcotics is genuine.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week the House International Relations Committee voted 27-5 to overturn Clinton's finding that Mexico was fully cooperating in the anti-drug fight. A similar measure has been introduced in the Senate and the Foreign Relations Committee has scheduled a hearing on the issue for Wednesday.</p>
<p>In an hour-long presentation on the Senate floor on Monday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, challenged Clinton's decision saying that by no stretch of imagination could it be said that Mexico was fully cooperating with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Do we do Mexico any favor by turning a blind eye to the depth of the problem?&quot; Feinstein asked. &quot;Will Mexico take the steps necessary to combat the flow of drugs if the U.S. keeps telling them year after year after year that they are doing enough? The truth is that failure to decertify Mexico makes a mockery of the entire process.&quot;</p>
<p>Under a 1961 law, congressional disapproval of Clinton's certification that Mexico is an anti-drug ally automatically triggers a ban on U.S. aid and requires votes against multilateral development bank assistance to Mexico.</p>
<p>Zedillo, under heavy pressure from Washington to show results in the drug war, has declared the fight against the traffickers who smuggle tons of cocaine, marijuana and heroin across the border into the United States each year, to be Mexico's top national security priority.</p>
<p>A team of three senior administration officials was in Mexico for talks last week. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright are to visit Mexico on April 11-12.</p>
