<title>USA: Securitization seen good move for emerging markets.</title>
<headline>Securitization seen good move for emerging markets.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>State Street Corp chairman and chief executive Marshall Carter said Tuesday that the securitization of assets can be the single most productive way for emerging markets to attract investment capital.</p>
<p>Carter was the keynote speaker and co-chairman of a conference called &quot;Making a Profit While Making a Difference.&quot; Participants included money managers and corporate executives who discussed socially responsible investing and other topics.  </p>
<p>Carter, head of the Boston-based money manager and provider of custodial services for the securities industry, said emerging countries should consider converting assets such as mortgages or a company's accounts receivable into negotiable liquid securities. He told the group institutional investors most of the time &quot;are bound by our fiduciary responsiblity to invest in liquid and marketable securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't do micro-lending, or buy debts on automobile purchases, unless those loans or those receivables are bundled up and securitized for us into the kind of assets we do invest in,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Some emerging markets present deterrents to investing. He cited capital controls, lengthy application processes and lack of a central registry for securities.</p>
<p>Global investors look for stability in a country's currency, economic conditions, monetary and fiscal policies. Also important are resonable regulation, easy convertibility of capital, easy flow of funds into and out of markets and reasonable levels of taxation, he added.</p>
<p>In a separate interview, Carter told a reporter he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with a Wall Street consensus estimate that State Street will earn $2.20 per share in 1997.</p>
<p>The company earned $1.78 per share diluted in 1996, adjusted for a two-for-one stock split paid in May of 1997.</p>
