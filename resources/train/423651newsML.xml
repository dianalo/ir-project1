<p>President Boris Yeltsin's address to parliament on Thursday nudged Russian share prices up slightly, but the rise was not strong due to the absence of active Western support, traders said.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System RTS index of 23 shares rose by 0.95 percent to 314.07 on $40.62 million in total volume.</p>
<p>&quot;On the whole, the market edged up slightly, but prices fluctuated,&quot; a trader from a Western investment company said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that Yeltsin pronounced his address in quite a firm voice and even raised his eyes to the hall made a positive impact on the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But whether it will cause a flow of funds to the market is a question. More likely, it will keep the market from falling.&quot;</p>
<p>IK Prospekt corporate securities director Andrei Ippolitov said local speculative buying after Yeltsin's address -- his first policy statement since recovering from months of illness -- sparked the small rise.</p>
<p>&quot;There were real buying orders, but I cannot say there were crazy volumes,&quot; the Western trader said. &quot;It looks like Western clients are in a buying mood, but they are not ready to buy anything at any price.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said rumours that Anatoly Chubais might be appointed First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy did not cause euphoria because, they said, the market was already overpriced and a Chubais appointment would push shares higher.</p>
<p>The RTS is about 10 percent below its February 19 record of 347.11 -- and some brokers think prices are still inflated.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the current levels, even after the recent correction, are still too high for buying,&quot; the Western trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, there are still people who bought paper at prices twice as low as the current ones -- that's why I do not rule out a wish to take profits.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian traders also said they preferred to hold their assets in cash, since they did not expect strong growth in the next few days.</p>
<p>Utility UES rose to $0.2115 from $0.2085 at Wednesday's close, Surgutneftegaz oil company was $0.793 after $0.765, LUKoil fell to $13.70 from $13.80 and utility Mosenergo was $1.340 after $1.348.</p>
