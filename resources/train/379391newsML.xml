<p>Official British retail price data may well overstate the true level of inflation but only to a small extent, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>Britain's Office for National Statistics (ONS) told Reuters it had no plans to look into potential bias in its retail price inflation index.</p>
<p>It was responding to a report from Channel 4 news on Thursday that the ONS had launched an inquiry into the accuracy of inflation data. The report said the government was concerned about the current series exaggerating the level of inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no formal inquiry into potential bias in the RPI as raised by Channel 4,&quot; an ONS spokesman said. &quot;The ONS did not say that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, we will continue to carry out our usual research and development of the figures to ensure that the RPI remains the most accurate measure of inflation as experienced by the vast majority of households in the UK.&quot;</p>
<p>Retail price data published on Thursday showed underlying inflation stuck at 3.1 percent year-on-year in January, well above the government's target of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets, said the official series may well overestimate the real level of inflation but said the problem applied to other inflation indices across the globe.</p>
<p>&quot;Indices like RPI tend not to pick up on the &quot;three for the price of two&quot; sort of deals offered by retailers,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is not a new story.&quot;</p>
<p>The issue of overblown inflation indices has also exercised politicians and economists in the United States.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee introduced a resolution to test the accuracy of the consumer price index. An advisory commission reported in December that the CPI overstated the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has argued that U.S. CPI overstates inflation by 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points a year.</p>
<p>But Michael Dicks, UK economist at Lehman Brothers, said the problem was much less severe in the UK because the basket of goods and services used to monitor RPI was updated every year. In the U.S., that happens only every five years.</p>
<p>The ONS spokesman said: &quot;We will be going through our normal, annual updating of the basket of goods and services used to keep track of inflation. But there are no plans to change our methods of calculation.&quot;</p>
<p>About 600 goods and services are monitored in the ONS basket for RPI.</p>
<p>&quot;We all know inflation is overstated in the UK but it's a lot less severe than in the U.S.,&quot; Dicks said. He estimated the level of exaggeration was about half that in the United States.</p>
<p>The Channel 4 report said the RPI basket did not include goods such as computers which have hardly risen in price in recent years even though quality and functionality has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>Dicks said technological change and improvement was a concern if it was expanding very fast. &quot;But by changing the basket once a year, it can't get too out of hand.&quot; More serious, he said, was the differences in indices across the globe. If the U.S. index overstates CPI by around one percentage point while UK RPI exaggerates by much less, investors in the financial markets could face problems.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. was starting to issue index-linked securities. Investors wishing to trade those against index-linked gilts in a spread trade could get burned by the inflation differential.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the end of the world, but it is a concern.&quot;</p>
