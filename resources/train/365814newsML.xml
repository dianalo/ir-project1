<p>The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said Sunday President Clinton's 1998 budget is a good starting point for negotiations and does not think Republicans must submit their own spending plan.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally would like to get to work on the president's document and get to work right away, and try to resolve differences and move to commonly agreed upon document and get it through Congress,&quot; Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican, said on CBS television's &quot;Face the Nations&quot; programme.</p>
<p>As head of the tax-writing committee in Congress, Archer will be influential in directing the path Republicans take toward reaching a budget deal with the White House.</p>
<p>Clinton's $1.69 trillion fiscal 1998 budget released Thursday proposed $98.4 billion in tax cuts over five years that are offset in part by $76 billion in higher taxes. It shows the deficit gradually narrowing over four years, with a surplus in 2002.</p>
<p>The fiscal 1998 budget, which covers the year beginning Oct. 1, forecast that the 1998 deficit would narrow to $120.6 billion from 1997's $125.6 billion and gradually shrink over the next three years to become a $17 billion surplus in 2002.</p>
<p>Stalemates over the budget led to two brief partial shutdowns of federal government operations in late 1995 and early 1996. Many Americans blamed that more on the Republicans than on Clinton, a development that has led Republican leaders to sound more conciliatory this time arou3nd.</p>
<p>But Archer did say Clinton's plan includes too much spending and too much taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;We're encourage that he has tax relief for families that's different than ours,&quot; he said. &quot;We think that can be improved on. We still think there's too much spending and too much taxes, and that's an area we'll have to resolve.&quot;</p>
<p>Archer declined to say how much additional tax relief beyond the $98.4 billion in Clinton's plan he would like. &quot;The bigger the number the better,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not locked in to a magic number.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans have proposed nearly double Clinton's tax cuts and with their main theme broader capital gains tax reductions. Clinton's capital gains tax relief centres on a tax break for homeowners, raising the amount of profit that can be excluded from taxation upon resale.</p>
<p>Franklin Raines, the White House director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the same programme that the administration is willing to listen to the Republican's push for broader cut on capital gains.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a plan that's now been offered that has tax cuts twice as high as the president has proposed,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't know how they're gonna pay for that. What we could be in favour of really depends a lot on what it's gonna cost and how it will be paid for.&quot;</p>
