<p>Thailand's aim to transform its petrochemical sector into a regional powerhouse was dealt a heavy blow on Thursday by news that three companies had shelved expansion plans, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Officials at National Petrochemical Corp (NPC) and Thai Petrochemical Industry (TPI) said they had postponed plans to build ethylene plants in 1999 indefinitely because of the country's economic problems.</p>
<p>Industry sources said a third project mooted by Bangkok Bank had also been shelved. Bangkok Bank officials could not be reached for confirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the economy has slowed down, we will carry out this project in the future,&quot; a TPI source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ethylene is the basic feedstock for plastic products. Analysts said the three projects are now expected to start up after 2001.</p>
<p>The Thai Board of Investment in May granted investment incentives to TPI Olefins Co, a unit of TPI, to build a 14 billion baht ($485 million) petrochemical complex.</p>
<p>At the core of the complex is a 700,000-tonne-per-year (tpa) ethylene plant due to come onstream by the end of 1999.</p>
<p>TPI officials said the company would instead try to &quot;debottleneck&quot; its initial plant -- raise the output capability of the existing facility -- before embarking on the new expansion.</p>
<p>TPI started up its first 350,000-tpa ethylene plant in February.</p>
<p>Thailand's pioneer petrochemical firm NPC, which operates a 410,000-tpa ethylene plant, is turning its attention to building plants that produce higher quality plastic products such as cable and wires.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we think we should concentrate investment in derivatives,&quot; an NPC official said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although the baht's fall after Wednesday's managed float will level out in the long term, the de facto devaluation had forced companies to review their investments.</p>
<p>The baht plunged 20 percent in the offshore markets and was last quoted at 28.50/29.50 to the dollar, as the central bank dropped its pegged rate system against a basket of currencies and allowed market forces to determine the new rate.</p>
<p>The flotation is the latest in a series of surprise measures by authorities to boost the economy, which is suffering its worst slump in more than a decade with slowing growth, sharply lower exports and a troubled finance sector.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the companies will now try and figure out where (chemical product) demand is going to be before they build new plants,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;In the past it was expected that demand will grow at 1.5 times of gross national product growth.&quot;</p>
<p>A senior source at state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) said: &quot;There is a curb on the expansion at the moment. We want to review the situation and find out what is the situation of the economy.&quot;</p>
<p>PTT is a major shareholder in two of Thailand's three ethylene producers -- NPC and Thai Olefins Co.</p>
<p>The only new ethylene project expected to come onstream in the next five years is led by Siam Cement Co Plc (SCC.BK.</p>
<p>Construction work on the 600,000-tpa plant had started and the plant was due to start in early 1999, said an official with the operator, Rayong Olefins Co, which is part owned by the Bangkok Bank group.</p>
<p>&quot;All the ethylene is for captive use. We are not affected by the economic situation, there is no exposure,&quot; he said.</p>
