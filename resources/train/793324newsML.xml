<p>Trade in emerging market debt was sluggish on Tuesday, with the market looking for direction in the U.S. Treasury market.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnover is low and the market is very dealer driven,&quot; a Brady bond trader at a European bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if the market will remain like this for the near future. It is trading in a tight range and looking for clues elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>Attention was focused on Wednesday's U.S. July retail sales. These are expected to be strong after a second quarter lull. A Reuter poll of economists forecast a rise of 0.7 percent in the headline retail sales and 0.5 percent ex-autos.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT on Tuesday second quarter U.S. productivity and unit labour cost figures will be released.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasuries have gained a little overnight, and we expect Bradys to track these gains and any other moves this week,&quot; a trader at a U.S. bank said.</p>
<p>Russian MinFins had firmed slightly on the back of local buying, traders said, especially series six and seven. MinFin 6 were up 0.375 points to 58.875 cents on the bid. MinFin 7 were up the same amount to 47.125 cents.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the $16 billion Thai rescue package from the International Monetary Fund and Asian nations was not expected to boost emerging market debt prices but was met with relief by the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors were concerned with what might go wrong with Thailand, and the effects that would have had on other emerging economies,&quot; an analyst at a European bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that it looks as if Thailand might be stabilised it has put the whole sector on a more secure footing. This has not led to higher prices, but just a more relaxed tone to the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thailand still has to commit to the full IMF package and the tough fiscal measures it will demand. The Thai cabinet will review details on August 19. -- Aline van Duyn, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7718</p>
