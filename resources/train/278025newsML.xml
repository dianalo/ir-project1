<p>Orders for costly manufactured goods like airplanes and computer components weakened sharply in November, the government said Friday, though fewer new unemployment claims last week suggested the economy was still expanding moderately.</p>
<p>The value of new orders for all types of durable goods -- items intended to last three years or more like cars and computers -- dropped 1.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $171.8 billion.</p>
<p>It was the first orders decline in three months and followed gains of 0.5 percent in October and 4.5 percent in September. The drop was entirely in commercial aircraft orders and in weaker demand for communications equipment and circuit boards, semiconductors and other computer parts.</p>
<p>Analysts said it appeared &quot;a moderate slowdown&quot; was occurring in the pace of factory business in the year's final quarter, though not enough to trigger alarm.</p>
<p>Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for first-time jobless benefits fell to 335,000 in the week ended Dec. 21 from a revised 350,000 in the week ended Dec. 14.</p>
<p>The department originally reported claims of 351,000 in the Dec. 14 week.</p>
<p>A four-week moving average, designed to smooth out weekly volatility in employment trends, barely edged down by 1,000 to 341,250 last week.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't look like there was very much labor market strength in December,&quot; said economist Dave Orr of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., adding that growth in factory orders also appeared to be easing in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Durables orders grew by 7.1 percent in the third quarter vs. the second quarter this year, Orr noted, but in the opening two months of the fourth quarter have increased just 5.7 percent from the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;There is moderation but not outright decline,&quot; Orr said, adding, &quot;A trend of deceleration is in place.&quot;</p>
<p>The last time that durable goods orders declined before last month was in August, when they fell 3.6 percent.</p>
<p>Although November orders declined, shipments of finished goods were up 0.8 percent to $170.1 billion after falling 1.2 percent in October. In addition, order backlogs grew last month by 0.3 percent to $488.5 billion -- the sixth gain in seven months.</p>
<p>New orders for all types of transportation equipment were flat in November at $41.6 billion -- about one-fourth of the value of overall durables orders -- following a 6.8 percent drop in October.</p>
<p>Excluding transportation, orders fell 2.2 percent -- the biggest monthly decline in nearly four years since a 2.4 percent drop in January 1993 -- following a 3 percent jump in October.</p>
<p>New orders for electronic and electrical equipment plunged 9.3 percent last month to $28.2 billion after a 16.9 percent jump in October. But analysts said last month's decline had to be measured against the big October rise.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember, (electrical machinery) was up 16.9 percent the prior month, so a deline of 9.3 percent is not surprising,&quot; said economist Astrid Adolfson of MCM MoneyWatch Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;It is definitely not a strong number ... manufacturing is still struggling,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Orders for defense goods, which experience wide monthly swings, shot up by 55.2 percent to $8.3 billion after a 2 percent rise in October.</p>
<p>If defense is excluded, total durables orders in November were down 3.4 percent after rising 0.4 percent in October.</p>
<p>Orders for non-defense capital goods, an indication of business investment in new equipment, fell 7.8 percent last month to $43.6 billion after declining 0.4 percent in October.</p>
<p>Orders for industrial machinery were up 0.3 percent in November to $31.9 billion after a 1.7 percent decrease in October. Primary metals orders gained 0.2 percent to $14.4 billion after a 1.9 percent October decline.</p>
