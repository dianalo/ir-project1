<p>Standing on that Houston street corner preaching the gospel taught George Foreman a valuable lesson about life, but mostly about boxing these days: it's all about fire trucks.</p>
<p>Foreman was in town on Monday to sell his next act -- an April 26 bout against Lou Savarese -- and recalled his early days of preaching and being ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, one day I said, 'yeah, I fought Muhammad Ali, I beat Joe Frazier,' and (the passersby) stopped for a moment. 'I gave them a tough fight.' Hmmmmm, maybe I should try to sell something here,&quot; Foreman thought when he finally was able to draw more than flies on that hot corner more than 10 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;And it taught me no one follows a water truck, but if you can keep a fire truck going by they'll come out of their homes to try and see where the fire is,&quot; Foreman said.</p>
<p>&quot;And that's what I've tried to be, a fire wagon,&quot; said the 48-year-old All Universe salesman at a news conference on the 106th floor at the World Trade Centre.</p>
<p>But even 106 floors wasn't high enough to avoid stepping in all that fertiliser being spread around to force-feed the boxing money tree.</p>
<p>There was Jeff Wald from something called Entertainment, Inc.</p>
<p>He put up some money for the promotion of the fight.</p>
<p>In return he got his name and two pages in the press kit, touting his expertise in managing or discovering such entertainers as Helen Reddy, the Pointer Sisters, Deep Purple, and, of course, the person who uniquely qualifies Wald for boxing -- Tiny Tim, the late ukulele-strumming, falsetto-voiced sideshow who had 15 minutes of fame about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Wald and the other moneymen hustling to sell tickets to Foreman-Saverese at the Atlantic City Convention Centre under the sponsorship of Bally's Park Place casino were at their spieling best.</p>
<p>They put a lot of effort, to say nothing of fertiliser, into claiming what this fight and the fighters were not.</p>
<p>&quot;George Foreman is not going to join the Marines after the fight,&quot; Wald said, &quot;he is not going to stand in his corner crying between rounds, and he's not going to hit below the belt.&quot;</p>
<p>Wald was referring to Riddick Bowe's short-lived enlistment in the Marine Corps, Oliver McCall's apparent nervous breakdown against Lennox Lewis last month and Andrew Golota losing twice to Bowe for hitting below the belt.</p>
<p>Foreman's advisor Henry Holmes insisted &quot;this is going to be a real fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Then it was promoter Dino Duva's turn: &quot;This is not a tuneup fight for George Foreman,&quot; Lou Saverese &quot;is a live opponent,&quot; Savarese (36-0) is &quot;not coming in to just pick up his check.&quot;</p>
<p>Gathering speed on his promoter's roll, Duva implored all to believe &quot;this is not any pushover fight for George Foreman.&quot;</p>
<p>Savarese, 31, is &quot;a quality opponent,&quot; insisted Duva, who said he would pay Saverese $500,000 to Foreman's $4 million.</p>
<p>Quality, maybe, but Savarese is at least a 100 floors away from parity.</p>
<p>Of course there always is Foreman, selling, selling and then when he gets bored selling some more. His latest riff is that he is the &quot;linear champion of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>That refers to a geneology of the world heavyweight championship that in short means someone can claim the title because he is &quot;the man who beat the man who beat the man.&quot;</p>
<p>In the heavyweight family tree according to Foreman, he beat Michael Moorer, who had beaten Evander Holyfield, who went on to beat Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>Of course, Foreman (75-4) leaves out his recent inactivity.</p>
<p>After winning the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association titles from Moorer with a dramatic 10th-round knockout in November, 1994, Foreman defended his IBF title against German Axel Schulz in April 1995.</p>
<p>But the WBA stripped him of his title, saying Schulz was not worthy of a title fight. And after many people thought Schulz won that fight, the IBF ordered a rematch. But Foreman, who says he wants to fight at least until he's 50, refused and was stripped of that title.</p>
<p>Then Foreman went to Japan to fight someone named Crawford Grimsley for the little respected World Boxing Union title.</p>
<p>But, &quot;the point is, I know who I am, and I know what I've done,&quot; Foreman says when pressed about his reading of the title's family tree.</p>
<p>&quot;And I'm not going to let anyone talk me out of that,&quot; Foreman said. &quot;I'm really the champion of the world.&quot;</p>
<p>As Foreman says, &quot;You gotta keep selling. If you don't learn to sell, you're probably gonna starve to death.&quot;</p>
<p>And Foreman does not look like he's starving to death.</p>
