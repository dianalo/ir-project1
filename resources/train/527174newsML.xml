<headline>SOCCER-MIDDLESBROUGH SET UP &quot;ITALIAN&quot; F.A. CUP FINAL.</headline>
<dateline>SHEFFIELD, England 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Middlesbrough reached the English F.A. Cup Final for the first time in their 121-year history on Tuesday, thanks to a Dane, an Italian and a Brazilian who all scored in a 3-0 semifinal replay victory over giantkillers Chesterfield.</p>
<p>The biggest impact on the game at Hillsborough was made by another of Middlesbrough's overseas signings -- the Brazilian Juninho who had an outstanding match and was unlucky to have what seemed a perfectly good goal disallowed for an innocuous foul by a team-mate.</p>
<p>Dane Mikkel Beck (12th minute), Italian Fabrizio Ravanelli (57th) and Brazilian Emerson (89th) all found the net as the premier league side finally overcame the stubborn resistance of second division Chesterfield, who held them to a 3-3 draw in the first encounter.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough will now meet Chelsea in the Cup Final at Wembley on May 17 in a match that could feature five Italians -- ex-Juventus team mates Ravanelli and Chelsea's Gianluca Vialli as well as Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola and Roberto di Matteo and Middlesborough's Gianluca Festa.</p>
<p>It means Middlesbrough's schizophrenic season could yet end on a high note. It will be their second final after losing to Leicester in the League Cup Final, yet they could still become the first team in English soccer history to win the F.A. Cup and be relegated.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, who captained Manchester United to three Cup Final victories in 1983, 1985 and 1990, was delighted afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;If we win the Cup and stay up this wouldn't have been a troubled season after all.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a fantastic boost to everyone at the club in our fight to stay up and now at least the players can put the Cup Final to the back of their minds and concentrate on getting the points we need to stay up.&quot;</p>
<p>Chesterfield manager John Duncan who had guided his club close to the first major final in their 131-year history, said he hoped Middlesbrough achieved both those aims.</p>
<p>&quot;On the night their class told in the end. It didn't help losiing the first goal, and the second goal killed us off, but this has been a memorable time in the history of this club and in the history of the town. I hope we can build on it for the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside Hillsborough was remarkable with the majority of the 30,000-plus crowd supporting the underdogs whose home ground is only 12 miles away.</p>
<p>But unlike the first game in which Chesterfield had led 2-0, the second division team never stamped their authority on the game and rarely troubled the Middlesbrough defence.</p>
<p>Beck put Middlesbrough ahead when he scored with a shot that went in off the far post after a through ball from the inspirational Juninho.</p>
<p>Juninho then had what appeared to be a perfectly good goal controversially disallowed 13 minutes later when referee David Elleray blew for shirt-pulling by Beck on Jamie Hewitt.</p>
<p>The Brazilian was far happier in the 57th minute after whipping in a freekick from the left which Ravanelli nodded home from close range to ensure the victory.</p>
<p>Emerson wrapped up the scoring a minute from the end when Ravanelli set him up for a shot which he lashed home from 22 metres.</p>
<p>But Middlesbrough will not have long to savour this victory. They are back in action on Thursday night when they play at Tottenham, desperate to pick up three vital points in their relegation battle.</p>
