<p>King Hussein of Jordan has indicated he is ready to give Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti a longterm mandate for wide-ranging economic and administrative reforms, the official Petra news agency said.</p>
<p>It quoted the king, who has reshuffled prime ministers on a regular basis, as telling Jordan television late on Friday he spoke to Kabariti recently about the challenges facing Jordan.</p>
<p>&quot;I said to him if he still had the same enthusiasm, honesty, bravery, integrity and righteousness which we know he has ... we will look at future issues with a new style,&quot; Petra quoted King Hussein as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;But if he is scared of confronting storms...and I do not think that is the case, then we will have to think of another solution,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Since his appointment one year ago Kabariti has pushed ahead with IMF-backed economic reforms including a cut in bread subsidies which led to riots in southern Jordan last August.</p>
<p>Jordan is due to hold parliamentary elections by November this year. The king had been expected to announce a new interim government within weeks because under Jordanian law, ministers serving in cabinet cannot stand for a parliamentary seat.</p>
<p>At present around two thirds of the cabinet are members of parliament and would have to step down before the elections if they want to run again for parliament.</p>
<p>But King Hussein said his discussions with Kabariti had gone further than discussing the interim period leading up to the elections, which should be held by November.</p>
<p>&quot;The next stage will not only be an interim phase for holding the elections,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The king said in future parliamentarians may be kept out of the cabinet, splitting the government's legislative and executive branches.</p>
<p>&quot;Plenty of evidence shows that it is not right to combine deputies and ministers (roles),&quot; he said. &quot;The deputy is a monitor of the government and he should devote his time and effort to following up the different laws put before them.&quot;</p>
<p>Critics of the present system say it almost guarantees the government a majority in the 80-seat lower house of parliament because a quarter of deputies are also ministers. Other deputies support the government in the hope of winning a cabinet post at the next reshuffle, they say.</p>
<p>King Hussein said Jordan faced a battle against &quot;deadly bureaucracy&quot;. After visiting a government department with Kabariti recently ... &quot;we left with the impression that this department would have been more productive if 70 percent of it were cut back,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also criticised Islamist MPs who walked out of parliament last week in protest at what they said was a weak government reaction to Israeli plans to build Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think that deputies were elected just to withdraw from parliament every now and then,&quot; he said.</p>
