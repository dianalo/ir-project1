<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>Marsh &amp; McLennan's $1.8 billion acquisition of Johnson &amp; Higgins went through mercifully quickly this week. Serious talk of a likely deal emerged on Monday and by Wednesday the ink was dry on the contracts.</p>
<p>There had been some speculation linking Marsh Mac and J&amp;H in recent weeks, but nothing to write home about in an industry alive with rumours. The signs are that the final decision was taken early this week with J&amp;H partners called back hurriedly to head office to make up their minds on a take it or leave it offer from Marsh Mac.</p>
<p>Limiting speculation and concluding a major deal quickly has much to commend it, especially in a people business like broking, where key staff are likely to jump ship at the first whiff of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The deal will take the heat off Marsh Mac now that it has regained its position as market leader, from which it was toppled by Aon last December. The J&amp;H acquisition is seen demonstrating a clear sense of direction and analysts and industry insiders had hardly a bad word to say about it.</p>
<p>However, the deal adds to the pressures on Sedgwick and Willis Corroon in Britain and adds to speculation about Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co in the U.S. as a possible takeover target. It also draws attention to the long-drawn out attempt by Marsh Mac to sell its troubled London-based Minet unit.</p>
<p>With J&amp;H out of the frame, the options for Sedgwick and Willis have narrowed further, but the savings that Marsh Mac will achieve from the merger underline the oft repeated message that times are hard in insurance broking and the only way forward is to consolidate.</p>
