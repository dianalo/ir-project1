<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine stocks bounce higher at close.</title>
<headline>Argentine stocks bounce higher at close.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-01-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine stocks rallied late in the session Wednesday taking their cue from Wall Street, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors were selective and cautious today, and the bolsa closely shadowed Wall Street with very little volume,&quot; said Jose Napoli of brokers Ignoto y Napoli.</p>
<p>He predicted a similar attitude Thursday ahead of the release of U.S. fourth quarter GDP.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index stretched a modest early gain in the final minutes of trading and closed up 1.6 percent at 676.89.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the market has much more upside this week. But if it stays near these levels between tomorrow and Friday we could deduce it's resumed its upward path,&quot; said Napoli. He predicted a near-term trading range of 650-680.</p>
<p>Floor volume remained very slack at 18.3 million pesos against 22.8 million Tuesday, while over-the-counter turnover dwindled to 35.7 million pesos from 111 million Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Many investors are holding their bets in view of the volatile streak in New York. So the market is just marking time, because it can't buck the trend in New York without heavier volume,&quot; another broker said.  </p>
<p>The broad market index closed up 1.3 percent in the session, with winners beating losers 39 to 17 and 13 issues closing unchanged.</p>
<p>The day's best main-tier performers were Bansud bank and real estate developer Irsa, which both surged 4.2 percent, followed by construction stock Polledo and steelmaker Acindar, up 4.0 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The only MerVal loser was carmaker Ciadea, which shed 1.0 percent.</p>
