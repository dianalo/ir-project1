<headline>Danish shares rally, advances seen continuing.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices closed higher on Wednesday, regaining much of Tuesday's losses in a correction expected to continue on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall most probably hold this level, with the possibility of a quarter percent rise depending on this evening's development in the United States,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index gained 0.65 point to 128.64 in overall bourse turnover of 914 million crowns.</p>
<p>It closed at 128.77 Monday but fell to 128.40 on Tuesday. The KFX December future rose 0.45 point to 128.15 with 380 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.  </p>
<p>Sophus Berendsen, which suffered a 51-crown fall to 675 crowns after making a profits warning on Monday, rose 10 crowns to 704 on Wednesday, having clawed back 19 crowns on Tuesday.</p>
<p>SAS was heavily traded, with 433,000 shares changing hands, but the price stayed unchanged at 71.50. The airline, which announced a sharp drop in profits on Tuesday, is likely to be the centre of attention again on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was analysts' meeting (with SAS) in Oslo today, so that is likely to sharpen interest,&quot; a dealer said. --Uffe Hansen, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33 969658</p>
