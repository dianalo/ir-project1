<title>USA: Police recover stolen Ford prototype car.</title>

<p>An experimental Ford Taurus that police estimate was worth $250,000 went for an unexpected test drive this week when the vehicle was carjacked.</p>
<p>Although spy photographers routinely stalk prototype vehicles in the Detroit area, it was believed to be one of the first times an experimental car was actually stolen at gunpoint in the Motor City.</p>
<p>The incident began on Wednesday evening as the car, being driven by a Ford engineer, was parked outside a video store on the east side of Detroit. Police said the 1997 Taurus looked like a normal version of the sedan from the outside, but inside it was filled with $60,000 worth of computer equipment used for measuring gas mileage of an experimental engine.</p>
<p>Police said two teens drove the car to a nearby apartment. Acting on a tip, officers found the teens and recovered much of the computer equipment, which had been removed from the vehicle and scattered around the building.</p>
<p>They later found the car and apprehended a 15-year-old who had tried to drive it away. Lt. Hilton Napoleon, head of the Detroit Police Department's Carjacking Task Force, said he expected three youths to be charged with armed robbery and carjacking. &quot;They probably still don't know what they had,&quot; Napoleon said.</p>
<p>Ford officials confirmed the stolen car belonged to the company but otherwise declined to comment.</p>
