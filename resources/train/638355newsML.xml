<p>Britain's former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said on Wednesday a single European currency was now much less likely to go ahead on time, adding that delay was advisable.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's put it off and try and get economic conditions right across Europe,&quot; he told BBC radio. &quot;I think that would be a good thing to do and would benefit all of us.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the alternative was to go ahead with looser criteria and more countries involved. That would leave Europe prone to &quot;high inflation and periods of high interest rates&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I strongly argue for delay...for however long it takes for the French and Germans and other principal governments of western Europe to get hold of their economies.&quot;</p>
<p>European economic and monetary union is scheduled to start on January 1, 1999. But the election of a Socialist-led government in France, together with the shelving of a German government plan to revalue its gold reserves, has cast fresh doubt on the process.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, sources in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition said the Bundesbank and German government had agreed to revalue gold and currency reserves at the end of this year but not transfer the profits to Bonn until 1998.</p>
<p>That could give Germany a real headache in cutting its budget deficit to the level required by the Maastricht Treaty this year. But equally, it eased market fears of a fudged single currency.</p>
<p>Clarke denied his views represented a change of heart with one eye on the campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party in which he is standing. He is the only Europhile of the six conestants.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always said covergence was more important than the timetable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clarke had insisted his Conservative government fought the last election campaign promising to keep a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; policy over EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know at the last election that the French were going to have an election or that the Germans were going to have a row with the Bundesbank. That has rather changed the circumstances.&quot;</p>
