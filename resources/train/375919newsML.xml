<title>NETHERLANDS: ARA fuel oil bunkers flat, rest of Europe dips.</title>
<headline>ARA fuel oil bunkers flat, rest of Europe dips.</headline>

<p>ARA bunkers were little changed on Thursday while other European bunkers mostly dipped in a thin day of trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST was quoted at around $98/100 fob after little change in the barge market.</p>
<p>A couple of large enquiries emerged. Both were won by majors who offered aggressively. Suppliers said the deals were clinched at $98. Independent traders, by contrast, were left with few crumbs.</p>
<p>Some said bunker suppliers were reluctant to quote numbers in the face of fierce competition from majors.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices dipped in response to the now becalmed Rotterdam market. On Wednesday, German suppliers said they had priced themselves out of the market. Prices fell $2 a tonne to $99/$101 fob on Thursday, but business barely improved.</p>
<p>Mediterranean prices were mostly softer, French and Spanish fuel oil bunkers dipping by $2 a tonne. However, Italian prices were slightly more expensive, resulting in a modest rise in enquiries.</p>
