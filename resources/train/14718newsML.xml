<headline>UN says Eritrea to withdraw from Red Sea island.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United Nations said on Monday it expected Eritrea to withdraw its troops from a contested Red Sea island in the next two or three few days, thereby calming its dispute with Yemen.</p>
<p>U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said Yemen had been notified and was in agreement. German Ambassador Tono Eitel, president of the Security Council, said Eritrea had made known its intention to withdraw shortly to French mediators who have been asked to handle the dispute for the United Nations.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is a welcome development,&quot; Eitel said.</p>
<p>Yemen said earlier it was pulling out of mediation efforts and would use force if Eritrea did not withdraw its troops from the disputed Lesser Hanish island near tanker routes at the Red Sea's southern entrance.</p>
<p>The two countries fought briefly last December over the island and then asked the United Nations to mediate.</p>
<p>French mediator Francis Gutman, who went to Sanaa and Asmara, said earlier this month that Eritrea had agreed to withdraw its forces so that arbitration procedures could take place.</p>
