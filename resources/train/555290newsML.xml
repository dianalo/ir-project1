<headline>European shares march higher with Wall St.</headline>

<p>European shares ended comfortably higher on Friday after digesting the latest U.S. monthly jobs report and the result of the British general election, while sterling regained its composure after an early wobble.</p>
<p>London blue chips chalked up a new record, closing at 4,455.6, up 10.6 points after recouping from early losses following Labour's crushing victory over the Conservatives who have been in power for 18 years.</p>
<p>Germany's DAX index ended 0.6 percent higher while in Paris the CAC index rose 0.3 percent, though trade in both cities was slow following Thursday's May Day holiday.</p>
<p>All three bourses were on tenterhooks ahead of the U.S. jobs report for April, but relaxed when trading screens flashed up a figure for new jobs which fell a long way below Wall Street economists' expectations.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labour Department said 142,000 non-farm jobs were created in April far fewer than the 211,000 rise which Wall Street economists had expected on average.</p>
<p>The fall took the U.S. unemployment rate to 4.9 percent -- its lowest in more than 23 years -- from 5.2 percent in March.</p>
<p>There is &quot;very little evidence in these numbers of upward pressure on wages. They mean the Fed will put (interst rate) policy on hold for another two months to look at additional employment reports,&quot; one U.S economist said.</p>
<p>Wall Street duly rose as expected and was some 20 points higher when European markets closed.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve central bank pays close attention to jobs figures in gauging inflation pressures. It has nudged rates higher once already this year to counter inflation and meets again to review policy on May 20.</p>
<p>Back in London, the huge election rout for Britain's Conservative party put Labour in government with a majority of about 180 seats.</p>
<p>&quot;There's an argument that we've known Labour was going to get in for months,&quot; said a dealer at a major securities house, &quot;and now they've got such a huge majority there's a degree of certainty so we could see the market go higher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The big questions now are on the econonmy and taxation, policy towards Europe and the constitution,&quot; another dealer said. &quot;There are some real minefields for them to negotiate and we shall have to wait and see what they do.&quot;</p>
<p>Losses for utility stocks, vulnerable to a Labour &quot;windfall&quot; tax under and to other tax changes, were offset by gains in exporters as sterling weakened.</p>
<p>Turning to currencies, Britain's election pushed sterling to centre stage in European trading, during which it recovered from a bout of early profit-taking to levels which were similar those before the election.</p>
<p>Sterling was at 2.7925 marks compared with 2.7940 at the previous European close, while against the generally firmer dollar it was at $1.6210, down from $1.6255, but off its low of 1.6008.</p>
<p>The pound was sold early in the session as longs were trimmed but bargain-hunters were happy to pick it up at lower levels because the fundamentals that pushed it to 4-1/2 year highs last month remain in its favour.</p>
<p>A Labour victory had been expected but the magnitude of the win caught many by surprise, traders said. Labour is expected to win a majority of about 180 seats in the 659-seat parliament.</p>
<p>Unless the government embarks on a completely different economic course than promised before the election, the pound still has scope to rise, analysts said. &quot;The new government will underline its credibility to the financial markets by raising interest rates very soon,&quot; said Paul Lambert, senior currency economist at UBS in London.</p>
<p>One of Labour's first tests comes with next week's planned monetary policy meeting, at which the Bank of England is expected to repeat its call for higher interest rates. Next month Labour is expected to deliver its first budget.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has inherited an economy in good shape,&quot; a London share dealer said. &quot;The question is whether they can keep it that way.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar closed higher against the mark after shrugging off the U.S. jobs figures which, had they been stronger, might have helped prompt a U.S. interest rate rise which would have been good news for the dollar.</p>
<p>The U.S. jobs report, gave mixed signals and pushed the dollar to session lows below 1.72 marks but buying on dips rejuvenated the currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The jobs data weighed on the dollar at first but it has come back nicely since,&quot; said Peter Wood, trader at Bank of Boston in London. &quot;The dollar didn't really have a life of its own today, it was all about sterling.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.7273 marks and 126.63 yen, compared with 1.7182 and 126.53 in late European trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCKS CLOSING PRICES</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 was up 17.2 points at 4,462.2.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index was up 7.7 points at 2,647.16.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was up 22.3 points at 3,460.37. The IBIS DAX index of post-bourse electronic trading hit a new trading high of 3,504.27 points and closed at a record of 3,491.08, up 52.99 points, or 1.5 percent.</p>
