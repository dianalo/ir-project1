<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is expected to take only three or four out of the six diesel cargoes that it was seeking in its second import tender for April delivery, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>In the tender which closed on Thursday, IOC sought a total of 270,000 tonnes for delivery to Kandla on the west coast--four cargoes of 1.0-percent sulphur diesel and two cargoes of the 0.5-percent grade.</p>
<p>The best offer for the 1.0-percent sulphur grade was made by a European major at $20.48 per tonne above the high of Mediterranean quotes, cost-and-freight (c-and-f) basis.</p>
<p>Traders said this offer was much lower than most other offers which were in the range of $28.00-$29.00 per tonne above the high of Mediterranean quotes, c-and-f. But some traders said there were also offers in the $26.00-premium range.</p>
<p>The lowest offer of the 0.5-percent sulphur grade was made by another European major at $28.87 per tonne above the high of Mediterranean quotes, c-and-f.</p>
<p>High offers were seen at $32.00-$32.20 per tonne above the high of Mediterranean quotes, c-and-f.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the cargoes would come from the Mediterranean as the spread between that region and Singapore is around $25.00 per tonne.</p>
<p>But they noted that because of the lower priced cargoes in the Mediterranean, freight availabilties are becoming tighter and this might make it difficult to ship cargoes from there.</p>
<p>The tender would be awarded later on Friday.</p>
<p>IOC has already bought 570,000 tonnes of 1.0-percent sulphur diesel in 15 cargoes in its first tender for April deliveries.</p>
<p>The lower-than-expected volume awarded in the first tender and the fewer cargoes that IOC was expected to buy in the second tender, were having a dampening effect on the diesel market.</p>
<p>Traders said with crude prices continuing to slide, and China remaining largely on the sidelines, diesel was under increased pressure.</p>
<p>Only Indonesia was providing some support after buying 3.5 million barrels for March.</p>
<p>Some traders said they did not expect physical diesel prices to continue to get support at the $25.00-level, which has been seen over the past two months.</p>
<p>Swaps prices have already breached $25.00 and has dipped further on Friday to $24.75/$24.95 for March, down 25 cents from, Thursday. March had traded at $24.85.</p>
