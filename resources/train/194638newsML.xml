<p>Ugandan authorities said on Saturday they had killed about 65 &quot;bandits&quot; near the southwest border with Zaire in fighting that started three days ago.</p>
<p>As many as 70,000 people were displaced by the fighting and the figure could rise to 75,000, an information department official in Kasese told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not expect it to get any worse than this. Most people are fleeing because of the ripple effect. You hear people are fleeing from one village so you do the same. Civilians are out of the lines of fire right now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the problem right now is one of supplies, food and other things because people are fleeing without taking anything,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Senior military sources said seven Ugandan soldiers were killed and 10 wounded since Uganda said Kasese district had been invaded by a combination of Zairean troops and Zairean-based Ugandan dissidents.</p>
<p>The fighting is linked to the month-long rebellion in eastern Zaire by ethnic Tutsis and other Zairean groups opposed to President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Uganda's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Martin Aliker said the Ugandan army repulsed the attack and killed three invaders.</p>
<p>Zaire has denied that its troops were involved.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 65 of the bandits have been killed since the fighting started. Seven Ugandan soldiers have been killed and 10 injured,&quot; a Ugandan defence military official told Reuters.</p>
<p>District administrator in Kasese Lilian Okech told reporters Zairean troops and Ugandan dissidents were still in control of the Mpondwe border post, Bwera town and Kisinga trading centre -- all along the border with Zaire. Army reinforcements were being mustered to drive them out.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall get rid of these thugs as soon as possible. We have a strong force but we don't want civilians to get caught in the crossfire,&quot; Okech told reporters.</p>
<p>Ugandan Health Minister Crispus Kinyonga, visiting a military barracks in Kasese on Thursday, fled on foot for one km (half-a-mile) before his driver rescued him, government officials said.</p>
<p>The minister's car was fired at several times, they added.</p>
<p>The privately owned Monitor daily newspaper reported that the rebels were only 12 km (seven miles) from Kasese town and six primary schools in the area had been closed and converted into make-shift settlements for fleeing displaced people.</p>
<p>It added that the invaders were Zairean troops, Ugandan dissidents and elements of the Rwanda Hutu militia Interahamwe.</p>
<p>The Zairean troops and the Interahamwe have both retreated before the rebels and may have entered Uganda mainly to escape the fighting and find food rathern than to attack, diplomatic sources say.</p>
<p>The government-owned New Vision newspaper said 450 &quot;bandits&quot; were involved in the fighting on Friday. It said among government forces killed was the local security chief.</p>
<p>&quot;Fleeing residents gave horrifying accounts of missing relatives, mostly children; they lamented about property abandoned,&quot; the New Vision said in a front-page story.</p>
<p>&quot;Barefoot people, some carrying heavy household property, loitered in Kasese in search of accommodation,&quot; it added.</p>
