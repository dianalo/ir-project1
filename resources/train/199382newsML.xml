<title>RWANDA: Rwanda says hardly any refugees left in Zaire.</title>
<headline>Rwanda says hardly any refugees left in Zaire.</headline>

<p>The Rwandan government said on Tuesday that there were hardly any refugees left in the South Kivu region of Zaire, so there was no longer any need for a planned Canadian-led multinational peace force.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be underlined that there are hardly any Rwandan refugees remaining in South Kivu,&quot; Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said refugees who had been in camps there had pushed north because of fighting between Zairean rebels and Hutu extremists, and had concentrated in the Mugunga and Lac Vert camps, eventually joining the refugees from those camps in a mass return to Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;These refugees who have returned home number 500,000 people, which broadly matches the real number of Rwandan refugees previously in eastern Zaire, in North and South Kivu,&quot; Gasana said.</p>
<p>Gasana's statistics bore no relation to the official numbers, used by all foreign governments. The United Nations relief agency UNHCR says there were 1.1 million Rwandan Hutus and 150,000 Burundian Hutus in camps in eastern Zaire before the start of the rebellion last month.</p>
<p>The UNHCR is the source for the estimated 500,000 returning refugees since November 15, but it and aid agencies on the ground say there are hundreds of thousands more Rwandan and Burundian refugees scattered in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>They may still be caught up in fighting, which is why France and some other countries believe the intervention force is still needed in Zaire.</p>
<p>Gasana repeated the Rwandan view that the original purpose of the force -- to help feed the refugees and clear a way for them to go home, if they wanted to -- had been rendered null and void by the voluntary return of the 500,000.</p>
<p>The resources originally set aside for the armed intervention force should be used for humanitarian aid to resettle the returnees instead, he added.</p>
<p>About 14 countries who have pledged troops for the 10,000-strong force are due to meet in Germany on Thursday to review their plans in the wake of the mass Hutu return.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said on Tuesday the United States has tentatively decided not to send troops to Zaire and will instead use U.S. military cargo planes to fly humanitarian aid to Rwanda.</p>
