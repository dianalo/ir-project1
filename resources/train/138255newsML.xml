<p>The currency market is turning a blind eye to the looming U.S. election but the dollar could lose its composure even if President Bill Clinton scores his expected victory on November 5, market analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Although surveys suggest the market is justified in pricing in Clinton's re-election, the big unknown factor is what will happen in Congress, where experts say the Democrats could seize control from the Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Clinton all the way on the presidential side but there's still a race on the Senate and House side,&quot; said John Calverley, chief economist and strategist at American Express.</p>
<p>Democratic control of the House of Representatives would prompt market fears of looser U.S. fiscal and trade policy -- and unsettle the dollar.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was widely assumed that Republicans would maintain control of both chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But Clinton's dominance of the presidential race has sparked speculation that his party could grab the House back.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than being split between Democrats in the White House and Republicans in Congress, it's now looking increasingly possible that the Republicans could be thrown out of Congress,&quot; said Stephen King, deputy chief economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;That gives you an extra bit of political risk as far as the dollar is concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>House Republicans hold a 235-198 majority. Democrats, who need a net gain of 18 seats to take back control of the House, recently took a Republican seat in Louisiana and have the support of the lone independent member of Congress.</p>
<p>The Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, is thought unlikely to fall to the Democrats.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Republicans' dominance in the legislature had been instrumental in Clinton's commitment to balancing the budget. So a Democratic swing could spell currency risk.</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be a bit more uncertainty about whether the incentive to balance the budget will be as strong as it has been in the last two years,&quot; said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p>On the trade side, there is a danger that a Democratic House could opt for more protectionist policies and possibly use the exchange rate as a weapon in trade disputes, he said.</p>
<p>The market showed its sensitivity to such concerns overnight, when the dollar/yen rate spiked lower on reports that a White House official had predicted that the U.S.-Japan trade gap would soon begin to widen after months of shrinkage.</p>
<p>Also unsettling the currency were complaints that the strength of the dollar --  currently near 33-month highs against the yen -- had harmed U.S. companies.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corp blamed dollar fluctuations for a loss of more than $70 million in the first quarter. Fellow computer giant International Business Machines Corp and U.S. car makers have also criticised the level of dollar.</p>
<p>The market fears that a Democrat-controlled House would pay more heed to such concerns once electioneering was over, analysts said. That would be a clear negative for the dollar.</p>
<p>As always, the market hates uncertainty and economists say its preferred outcome would be no change -- Clinton staying in the White House and the Republicans keeping control of Congress.</p>
<p>But even if Clinton's party does take the House, market fears may prove unfounded, said Calverley at American Express.</p>
<p>Some of the programmes that the left likes, such as boosting social spending, are likely to go ahead, he said, &quot;but the mood in the U.S. is still anti-big government and controlling spending.&quot;</p>
