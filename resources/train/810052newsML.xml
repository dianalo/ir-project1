<p>September BTPs futures on LIFFE are gearing up for a challenge of the 136.38 range high on Tuesday but will find their efforts thwarted beyond there, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will go and have a look at the top of the range,&quot; said Susan Rigg, technical analyst at Chart Analysis in London.</p>
<p>The contract hit a high of 136.38 on August 12, the top of a broad sideways trading pattern since tumbling from a 138.05 high on July 31.</p>
<p>BTPs were quoted at 135.92 at 0807 GMT, up 0.40 on the day.  </p>
<p>But Rigg said the speed with which the contract fell from the high suggests that peak will remain unchallenged for now and more consoldiation above 136.38 was necessary.</p>
<p>A breakdown above 136.38 would put support at 134.65/70 into the frame, Rigg said. This area incorporates the August 18 low.</p>
<p>Technical analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London said before 136.38, BTPs need to tackle 135.92, a 38.2 percent retracement of the slide from July 23.</p>
<p>A 50 percent retracement of the same move gives resistance at 136.40, close to that 136.38 key high, they said in a note.  </p>
<p>They added it would take a confirmed break of the low at 134.73 on August 6, then the potential top neckline at 134.34 to confirm the overall downside bias.</p>
<p>At the short end, December Eurolire were quoted at 93.58, up five basis points on the day, having barged through minor down trendline resistance at 93.55 in early trade.</p>
<p>Next upside target was 93.61 the high on August 7.</p>
