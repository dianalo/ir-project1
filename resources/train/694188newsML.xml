<headline>EU to rule Alitalia cash state aid - report.</headline>

<p>European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock has decided that a recapitalisation of troubled Italian flag carrier Alitalia must be classed as state aid and not a market investment, Corriere della Sera reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Kinnock's decision, which will be finalised in a couple of weeks, would also cut the amount to 2.75 trillion lire from three trillion lire.</p>
<p>Italy last year requested EU permission for a capital injection worth some 3.3 trillion lire to rescue the debt-ladden, state-controlled airline.</p>
<p>Alitalia's managing director Domenico Cempella said last month that the Commission had suggested a reduction to 2.8 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Italy argues that the capital injection does not amount to state subsidies, but that it is acting in accordance with its right as a shareholder in the company -- a view which the Commission has rejected in many other airline rescue plans.</p>
<p>Corriere said, however, that Alitalia's negotiations with Kinnock had succeeded in easing some of the strict conditions that are usually attached to the granting of state aid.</p>
<p>Alitalia would not be allowed to offer the lowest price on any route to avoid charges of state-sponsored dumping, it said.</p>
<p>Alitalia declined to comment on the report. &quot;The decision is due in mid-July,&quot; a spokesman said. There was no immediate comment from Brussels.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Kinnock's decision should confirm a 14-plane cut in the fleet, the loss of 27,000 flights a year and a 10 percent reduction in activity on European routes as outlined by Cempella in March after the Commission sent the rescue plan back to Italy for changes.</p>
<p>Kinnock would also seek an increase in job losses to 2,100 from the 1,850 planned, it said.</p>
<p>Commercial director Federico Nucci said earlier this month that Alitalia's current performance was ahead of forecasts. &quot;If we can continue in this actual trend we will not close 1997 at breakeven, but with a significant profit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Alitalia had a group net consolidated loss of 1.203 trillion lire in 1996, its ninth loss in a row.</p>
