<p>Indications are that China may have bought 173,000 to 200,000 tonnes of soybean oil of Latin American origin during the past few days, possibly for October shipment, several U.S. traders and exporters said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been talk about it, but whether they did it or not, I do not know,&quot; a U.S. Midwest vegoil trader said.</p>
<p>Another soybean trader said several cargoes were bought, all South American oil, during the past few days, for October shipment.</p>
<p>One export broker said he believed China bought 200,000 tonnes soyoil for November delivery on Thursday night.  </p>
<p>&quot;I do know 200,000 tonnes was done last night,&quot; he said. &quot;That is rather bearish for CBOT soyoil,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>December soyoil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 0.83 cent to 22.77 cents per lb at 1223 CDT.</p>
<p>But one U.S. exporter said he had not heard any reports of China buying significant quantities of South American soyoil.</p>
<p>&quot;There is continued business going on to China but it is not in 200,000 tonne lots,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a couple thousand here and a couple of thousand there and it is just standard business. There is nothing exceptional going on.&quot;  </p>
<p>A second U.S. exporter said he would not be surprised if China did that kind of huge business for a week's activity.</p>
<p>He noted that China had been quiet in the soyoil market for quite a while when prices were a little bit higher.</p>
<p>&quot;But prices have come down in the last month or so. So it's gotten to the point where prices are more attractive to them,&quot; he said. With the CBOT board down, U.S. soyoil prices were getting close to being competitive with South America. &quot;The gap has narrowed considerably,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Argentinian soybean oil was around $500.00 a tonne FOB for October delivery while U.S. soybean oil was at $510.00, the exporter said.</p>
