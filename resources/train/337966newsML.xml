<headline>Labor nominee may have skirted the law, Lott says.</headline>

<p>Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said on Tuesday that Alexis Herman, President Clinton's nominee to be labour secretary, might have come close to violating the law in her work as a White House official.</p>
<p>Lott was commenting on Herman's reported role in arranging private fund-raising meetings between Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and corporate executives.</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans say the nominations of Herman and Transportation Secretary-designate Rodney Slater could be in for a rough time in Senate confirmation hearings because of questions about apparent involvement in political activities.</p>
<p>&quot;This latest information that has come out about arranging for meetings, appointments to the White House ... gets awfully close to the edge of violating the Hatch Act,&quot; Lott said, referring to a law barring government officials from partisan activities.</p>
<p>Lott said he did not know if Herman's nomination was in jeopardy and had thought she was a good choice for labour secretary.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have to take a look at what she did and see if there are any problems,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope there are not.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Herman's activity &quot;certainly on its face appears bad judgment&quot; and senators had to determine if it was anything more than that.</p>
