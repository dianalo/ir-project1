<p>The Australian dollar slid 1/2 U.S. cent in brisk trade after the 1997/98 Federal budget proved to be looser than the market had been hoping for.</p>
<p>By 8.00 p.m. (1000 GMT) the dollar had lost all the day's gains, falling to US$0.7775/80 from US$0.7826/31 just before the budget details hit dealing screens 30 minutes earlier, to be back at Tuesday's local finish.  </p>
<p>Dealers said US$0.7775 was a support level, with the next level being US$0.7750.</p>
<p>The government projected an underlying shortfall of A$3.9 billion for the next financial year, around A$2.0 billion more than analysts had looked for. The headline surplus was also far smaller than recent speculation had favoured.</p>
<p>The dollar had edged higher through the day, partly in anticipation of a tight budget which would cut up to A$2.0 billion in government spending.  </p>
<p>The actual cuts were a mere A$352 million, which analysts saw as a worrying sign of a slackening in resolve by the government in adressing Australia's long term savings problems.</p>
<p>The economic forecasts underpinning the budget were deemed mixed by analysts. A GDP growth rate of 3.75 percent pencilled in for 1997/98 melded well with median market expectations of 3.9 percent, but the government saw underlying inflation at 2.0 percent when analysts reckoned 2.5 percent was more likely.</p>
