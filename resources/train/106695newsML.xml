<p>Asian insurance companies forming joint ventures with partners from overseas should make sure they include a get-out clause in the deal in case the situation changes, industry leaders heard on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rudy Wuwungan, president of Maskapai Reasuransi Indonesia, told delegates at the East Asian Insurance Congress conference that while joint ventures can bring many benefits, the industry is currently too unpredictable to take any chances.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, when forming a joint venture one should not only think about how to make it a long-lasting successful set-up, but also how to end it when unexpected changes happen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Governments have encouraged joint ventures between foreign and local insurers in Southeast Asia in particular because they allow technology transfer and training and spur economic growth.</p>
<p>Wuwungan highlighted the example of Indonesia, where there are now 16 such partnerships.</p>
<p>&quot;But at some point, even after a long and productive relationship, changing circumstances may cause one partner to re-evaluate its role in a joint venture,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Take the case of two big international insurers, both having joint ventures in a developing country, who to meet global competition feel the need to merge. What would happen to their joint ventures overseas, and how would their partners react?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>The global insurance industry has seen a spate of mergers and acquisitions in recent years as companies struggle to remain competitive. Examples in the past few months include the merger of Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance in the UK, and the takeover of American Re in the United States by Germany's Munich Re.</p>
<p>Wuwungan argued that the best way for Asian insurers to avoid problems with partners was to include a termination clause in the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;To fix a mutually agreed termination clause right at the beginning might seem strange, because a joint venture is based on collaboration and trust. However, it should form the perfect solution to avoid conflicts with partners when sudden changes happen,&quot; he said.</p>
