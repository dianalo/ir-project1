<p>H.I.S. Co Ltd, a Tokyo-based discount airline ticket agency, plans to start regular domestic flights in two years in a bid to compete with the three major airline companies dominating the Japanese market, Japanese media reported over the weekend.</p>
<p>It would be the first time in 43 years that a new company would be set up to offer nationwide flights.</p>
<p>The company plans to set up a new company in Tokyo next month aiming to inaugurate Haneda-Sapporo flights at half the current fare. The new company will be capitalised at 100-200 million yen and H.I.S. will take a 30-70 percent stake in the new company, according to the media reports.  </p>
<p>Company officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The media reports said the company aims to apply for a government license to operate the domestic flights early next year. After that, it plans to become an airline operator with additional capital of several billion yen.</p>
<p>The company plans to rent three aircraft from leasing companies with a capacity of about 300 people and to hire foreign pilots and crew at lower salaries than those paid to Japanese crews, the reports said.</p>
<p>It would consign servicing of the planes to the major domestic airlines, they said.</p>
<p>The company intends to obtain some of Haneda airport's allotment of 40 new flights early next year after completion of a new runaway there and to start six round-trips a day, the reports said. -- Tokyo Equities Desk +81-3-3432-9052</p>
