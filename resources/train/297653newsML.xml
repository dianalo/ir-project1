<title>FRANCE: French court seen clearing BA plan for Air Liberte.</title>
<headline>French court seen clearing BA plan for Air Liberte.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-01-09</dateline>

<p>The commercial court of Creteil is expected to formally approve a plan by British Airways and France's Banque Rivaud to take over insolvent carrier Air Liberte on Thursday afternoon, officials at the airlines said.</p>
<p>The court decision, expected after 1400 GMT, would conclude a takeover which has already begun in effect. Air Liberte's board of directors on December 30 elected the head of BA's French subsidiary TAT, Marc Rochet, as its new chairman.</p>
<p>Court administrators have said the plan by BA and Rivaud, which joined forces in October after Rivaud fell out with its former bid partners because of conflicts over financing, looked to be the only viable proposal to keep Air Liberte afloat.</p>
<p>Richard Branson's Virgin Express had considered putting in a bid for the group but last month said it would not.</p>
<p>Under the BA/Rivaud plan, BA would take 70 percent of Air Liberte and Rivaud 30 percent. The plan aims to preserve 1,250 of the 1,400 jobs at the airline. It offers creditors cash up front for part of the debt or full payment over 10 years.</p>
<p>BA plans to eventually merge Air Liberte and TAT, which hold a combined 22 percent of the French market dominated by Air France's regional arm Air France Europe.</p>
<p>After studying the plan, the Creteil court ruled in November not to liquidate Air Liberte, which went into receivership on September 26 with debts of close to one billion francs.</p>
<p>The carrier ran into difficulties, losing 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 after a price war erupted in the French market following its liberalisation at the start of 1996.</p>
<p>The court decision confirms a takeover already under way. Air Liberte's board of directors on December 30 elected the head of BA's French subsidiary TAT as its chairman, and the British carrier has already invested cash to keep Air Liberte afloat.</p>
<p>BA and Rivaud joined forces in October to present a recovery plan for Air Liberte. Under the terms of the plan, BA would take 70 percent of Air Liberte and Rivaud 30 percent.</p>
