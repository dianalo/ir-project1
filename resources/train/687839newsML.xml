<p>There are six days to go before the British colony reverts to China.</p>
<p>These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMIC TIMES said the decision on the salary and benefits of post-handover leader Tung Chee-hwa was reasonable, but should not be taken as a long-term arrangement for all future chief executives. It said because Tung was a successful businessman, he did not care much about his income, which will be HK$330,000 (US$42,600) per month. But a salary lower than that received by top private company employees would not be fair to his successors who might not be as well off.</p>
<p>-- WEN WEI PO said some foreign publications had published rumours about Tung's failure to cooperate with top civil servants, but they would not hinder a peaceful handover or the implementation of the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; policy. It said Hong Kong civil servants have tried their best to ensure a smooth handover and shown great patriotic feelings.</p>
<p>-- SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said both Britain and China should learn a lesson from their agreement on the transfer of defence and try to avoid any more unnecessary rows. The presence of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the handover ceremony should be an opportunity for putting aside past differences and forging a new relationship.</p>
