<p>Indian call money rates fell sharply on Wednesday, ending in the 2.0-3.0 percent range on lack of demand for funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>Call money fell after opening the day in the 5.0-7.0 percent range.</p>
<p>Rates have come down from the 9.0-10.0 percent levels on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was little demand for funds as most banks seemed to have covered their positions ahead of the reporting Friday on August 30.</p>
<p>&quot;Lenders were chasing borrowers today,&quot; a dealer at a foreign bank said. &quot;There was little demand for funds.&quot;</p>
<p>Security prices firmed up marginally in the secondary market as low call money rates led to buying interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>Treasury bills maturing in mid-September were traded at yields between 7.50-7.70 percent, down from Tuesday's nine percent levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>The 364-day treasury bill maturing on July 18, 1997 was traded at a yield of 12.70 percent against Tuesday's 12.85.</p>
<p>Securities with a one-year maturity were traded at a yield of 13.06 percent against 13.20 on Tuesday while two-year securities were traded at 13.40 percent against 13.57 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>No trades were reported in certificates of deposits or commercial paper.</p>
