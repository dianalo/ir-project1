<p>A convicted double murderer on Tuesday urged an extortionist to stop a bid to free him by threatening to plant poisoned biscuits in Australian supermarkets.</p>
<p>&quot;I want everyone to know that I had no part in these threats,&quot; Ron Thomas said in a signed letter issued by his solicitor.</p>
<p>The extortionist threatened to plant biscuits laced with a pesticide in stores in the states of New South Wales and Queensland from Monday unless four police involved in Thomas' case took a lie detector test.</p>
<p>Monday's deadline passed without incident.</p>
<p>Australia's largest biscuit manufacturer Arnotts, which received the threat, has removed all its products from stores.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know who made the threats and I have never asked anybody to make them,&quot; said Thomas, who is serving two life sentences for a 1991 double shooting murder he says he didn't commit.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make the strongest possible appeal to whoever has done this not to take these threats any further and to withdraw the threats immediately. I don't want any innocent people harmed in my name.&quot;</p>
<p>Police have refused to meet the extortionist's demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Any form of backdown would be wrong because it would only encourage these creatures,&quot; Queensland Police Minister Russell Cooper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The New South Wales and Queensland state governments on Tuesday offered a combined A$100,000 (US$76,000) reward in the hunt for the extortionist.</p>
<p>Police probing the extortion threat have said they want to question John Bobak, for whom there is already a A$50,000 reward and a warrant in place in relation to the 1991 murders.</p>
<p>Police have warned shoppers to be vigilant, saying other food companies could be targeted.</p>
<p>Arnotts has suspended a few hundred casual workers, but has warned it was prepared to shut down factory lines and suspend up to 1,000 workers.</p>
<p>Arnotts, which is 70 percent controlled by U.S. food giant Campbell Soup Co, says the extortion crisis will cost it A$5.0 million each week in lost sales and is working on tamper-proof packaging to get its products back in stores.</p>
<p>Arnotts sells biscuits to Asia, New Zealand and Pacific island countries, but says its exports are safe and that the company's factories and distribution networks are secure.</p>
<p>Thomas said he thanked the extortionist for trying to help him, but added he preferred if people started a media campaign to free him instead.</p>
<p>&quot;I know you are trying to help me, but this is not the way to do it. Right now I am trying to put together an appeal...If anything is to be done for me it must be done through the courts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.76)</p>
