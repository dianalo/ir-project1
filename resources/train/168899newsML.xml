<headline>SOCCER-FORMER GOALSCORING HERO TOMMY LAWTON DIES AT 77.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tommy Lawton, once Britain's most expensive footballer, has died aged 77.</p>
<p>A popular figure during an era which produced many soccer heroes, he scored 22 goals from only 23 appearances as centre forward for England either side of the Second World War.</p>
<p>He began as a 17-year-old with Burnley and, at the age of 19, scored 34 goals for Everton in the 1938-39 season, when they won the league championship.</p>
<p>Lawton, who favoured a distinctive centre-parting hairstyle, also struck 90 goals in 151 matches for third division Notts County and increased attendances from 9,000 to 35,000 after joining them for the then record fee of 20,000 pounds ($32,000) in 1947. His other clubs were Chelsea and Arsenal.</p>
<p>As he played at a time when the maximum wage operated in English football, he was never rich, earning at most 12 pounds ($19) a week before retiring to a modest existence in the English midlands at Nottingham.</p>
