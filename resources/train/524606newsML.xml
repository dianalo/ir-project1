<p>The Japanese government proposed unlimited aviation rights for two Japanese and two U.S. carriers, and an easing of rules on &quot;beyond rights&quot; for U.S. airlines in recent bilateral air talks, a Japanese government source said on Monday.</p>
<p>The talks also yielded a U.S. acceptance of more aviation rights for All Nippon Airways in line with other carriers covered by the current 1952 bilateral treaty, the source said.</p>
<p>The contents of the informal bilateral discussions, held in Hawaii from April 9 to 11, were not revealed at the time.</p>
<p>Japan says it has made bold and daring proposals aimed at solving their decades-old civil aviation dispute but Washington has termed progress limited.</p>
<p>The source said Tokyo proposed unlimited rights on points served and frequencies for the two Japanese carriers, Japan Airlines Co Ltd and All Nippon Airways Co Ltd, as well as two U.S. carriers -- UAL Corp's United Airlines and Northwest Airlines Corp.</p>
<p>The source said the United States had agreed to this part of the proposal but wanted a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>Tokyo had also proposed an expansion of rights for other U.S. airlines that do not possess the same privileges as United and Northwest under the treaty, the source said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Under the current pact, All Nippon Airways and other U.S. carriers do not have as many rights to routes as the other three carriers.</p>
<p>Another Japanese proposal would allow U.S. airlines to fly from Japan on to any point in a third country, the source said.</p>
<p>The source added, however, that Japan still wanted a cap on the number of beyond routes.</p>
<p>The proposal on &quot;beyond rights&quot; -- the right to take passengers onto a third country which has been a major bone of contention between the countries -- represents a major about-face for the Japanese government.</p>
<p>U.S. carriers claim the existing bilateral treaty already gives them beyond rights and that Japan has withheld approval for new routes as leverage to push for changes in the treaty.</p>
<p>But Tokyo argues the treaty only provides for beyond rights in certain circumstances and has said that Japanese airlines should be on an &quot;equal footing&quot; with U.S. carriers before further deregulation can take place.</p>
<p>The source said a major obstacle to progress was U.S. determination that Japan agree that &quot;open skies&quot; -- the lifting of all regulations for all carriers -- be the ultimate goal of the talks.</p>
<p>Tokyo, however, rejects open skies, arguing that such pacts only lead to monopolistic alliances which stifle competition and are dominated by U.S. mega-carriers.</p>
