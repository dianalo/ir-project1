<p>Fox Television's &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot; were among this year's Peabody Award recipients for broadcast and cable excellence, award sponsors said Thursday.</p>
<p>ABC's &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and NBC's &quot;Law and Order&quot; also were among winners of the 56th annual George Foster Peabody Awards from the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communications.</p>
<p>The awards will be presented formally May 12 during a ceremony at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.</p>
<p>Six of the 31 Peabodys awarded this year went to Boston Public Broadcasting Service affiliate WGBH-TV for episodes of of the documentary series &quot;Frontline,&quot; the science programme &quot;NOVA,&quot; &quot;The American Experience&quot; and &quot;Mobil Masterpiece Theatre.&quot;</p>
<p>Unlike other industry honours, the Peabody Awards are not given within designated categories and the number of awards varies from year to year.</p>
<p>Hollywood director Steven Spielberg received his second Peabody Award for the Turner Original Productions documentary &quot;Survivors of the Holocaust.&quot; Judges noted his work in preserving the testimonies of Holocaust survivors.</p>
<p>Another winner was &quot;The 14 Stories of Eric Morse,&quot; a National Public Radio documentary about the 1994 death of a Chicago youngster who was thrown from the 14th floor of a housing project by two other boys. The two reporters were 16-year-old project residents.</p>
<p>Award sponsors noted that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; still offered biting satire as social commentary after eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;NYPD Blue&quot; was described as having transcended other police dramas by confronting the conflicted circumstances of homicide officers in New York City.</p>
<p>Sponsors cited &quot;The X-Files&quot; for bringing new vitality to prime-time television entertainment, and noted &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; for its insights into core social issues.</p>
