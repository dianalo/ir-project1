<p>Israel will re-enter areas it handed over to the Palestinians if necessary to seize &quot;terrorists&quot;, an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday following a suicide bombing in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet decision is quite clear. If Israel has to, that is if the Palestinian Authority is not going to do what it is supposed to do against the terrorists, Israel will have to do it. Israel will have to go into the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority if that is necessary and get the terrorists there,&quot; communications chief David Bar-Illan told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Israel has handed over much of the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority under peace deals signed since 1993.</p>
<p>Two suicide bombers killed 13 people in the main Jewish market in Jerusalem on Wednesday, prompting Netanyahu's government to halt peace talks with the Authority and demand Arafat crack down on Moslem militants who claimed the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that we must do what we have to do in order to eliminate this scourge and we are just hoping that the peace process will be saved by a total change, a 180-degree change as the prime minister has put it, in the attitude and in the deeds of the Palestinian Authority,&quot; Bar-Illan said.</p>
