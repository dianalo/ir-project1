<title>GERMANY: German officials fear floods may burst river banks.</title>
<headline>German officials fear floods may burst river banks.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT ON THE ODER, Germany 1997-07-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>German officials said on Saturday they feared dykes may not stand up to the strain of a wave of floods which has already claimed scores lives in neighbouring Poland.</p>
<p>Alwin Ziel, the interior minister in the state of Brandenburg, said the floods could last up to 14 days, putting the banks and flood walls under severe pressure.</p>
<p>The floods have left areas close to the Oder river bodering Germany and Poland under water.</p>
<p>Werner Mueller, a senior regional government official coordinating efforts to minimise flood damage, said the flood walls had held up to the strain so far.</p>
<p>&quot;What worries us, however, is that if the rain increases and lasts for a longer period then that could combine with the water which has been lying on the dykes for a long time to weaken the dykes,&quot; Mueller said. &quot;That's our greatest fear.&quot;</p>
<p>Floods in Poland have killed almost 50 people, swamped 4,000 sq km and hit a thousand villages and population centres such as the major cities of Wroclaw and Opole.</p>
<p>German Police have already closed off bridges over the Oder to Poland and have evacuated small numbers of people from their homes. But fears the water would reach a level overnight threatening large parts of Frankfurt proved unfounded.</p>
