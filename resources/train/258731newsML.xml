<p>Naphtha prices were notionally firmer in late afternoon Tokyo trade on Monday in reaction to Friday's crude surges on overseas markets, traders said.</p>
<p>However, market participants were mostly on the sidelines, unsure of market direction after the sharp increase in crude prices on Friday.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for second-half February was assessed at $233.00/236.00. It was sold to a Japanese trading house at $230.00 on Friday.</p>
<p>First-half March was quoted about $3.00 to $4.00 per tonne lower than the second-half February level.  </p>
<p>The backwardation in naphtha's inter-delivery spreads shrank further, with first-half February/first-half March indicated at plus $6.00/7.50, compared to Friday's $7.00/8.00.</p>
<p>Low-sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) prices gained further ground, with spot cargoes quoted over $25.00 per barrel on a free-on-board (FOB) basis.</p>
<p>Traders said the current LSWR prices, which have surpassed benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices, are &quot;exceptionally high.&quot; LSWR prices are usually about $4.00 per barrel lower than WTI prices, they added.</p>
