<title>FRANCE: Another French daily flouts law on election polls.</title>
<headline>Another French daily flouts law on election polls.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>French laws banning the publishing of opinion polls in the week ahead of elections were flouted again on Friday when the newspaper Le Parisien printed results of a poll on France's elections conducted by a Swiss daily.</p>
<p>It was the second such case after the publication by the regional newspaper La Republique des Pyrenees of a poll on May 23 just ahead of the first round of France's general elections.</p>
<p>Both Le Parisien and the southwest France daily now run the risk of a 500,000 franc ($88,000) fine.</p>
<p>The poll which Le Parisien reproduced came from the daily La Tribune de Geneve published just across the border from France and available in border areas.</p>
<p>Le Parisien editor Noel Couedel wrote in a front-page editorial that he was intentionally flouting the law &quot;in the name of freedom of information...and equality&quot; since people with access to the Internet system had easy access to such polls whereas less privileged voters did not.</p>
<p>Jean-Marcel Bouguereau, editor of La Republique des Pyrenees had written that confidential polls were available to people like politicians, stock brokers and journalists and there was no reason the general public should not also have access to them.</p>
<p>The anti-surveys law is meant to avoid swaying voters. The polls, or rumours of them, are a major factor moving the Paris stock market ahead of the election.</p>
<p>Polls taken before the first round all gave the ruling centre-right at least a narrow lead over the left.</p>
<p>But all were mistaken since the left came out well ahead.</p>
<p>Similar bans apply in countries like Belgium, Spain and Italy. But Britain, Germany and the United States have no restrictions on polls.</p>
