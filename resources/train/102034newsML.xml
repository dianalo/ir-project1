<p>A slump in South African business activity and confidence in the third quarter could be offset by good conditions in the farm sector and work on large infrastructural projects, the University of Stellenbosch said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A report by the university's Bureau for Economic Research (BER) said it expected average growth of three percent this year, slowing to 2.7 percent only if there was no further growth in the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Its latest round of surveys found that the non-primary sectors of the economy contracted in the third quarter and would do so in the fourth quarter as well.</p>
<p>BER director Ockie Stuart said the economy &quot;was actually relatively lively during the first half of the year&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The second quarter growth in GDP relative to the same quarter in 1995 came to 3.2 percent with consumer spending posting growth of 4.6 percent, government consumption expenditure 2.6 percent and fixed investment six percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Should the GDP show no further growth during the remainder of the year, the average for 1996 will still be 2.7 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>BER found that the expected recovery in domestic and export sales for the manufacturing sector did not materialise, although export sales were better than domestic sales.</p>
<p>The unexpected sluggish demand caused a build-up of stocks of finished goods. General business conditions were reported to be worse than a year ago, factory workers were retrenched and less hours were worked per factory.</p>
<p>Despite this, more respondents reported that they were investing in fixed assets and planned to continue doing so over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Stuart warned that this could again be an attempt to replace labour with machines as &quot;very few, if any, new employment opportunities were created during the past 18 months.&quot;</p>
<p>In the wholesale sector, third quarter sales were higher than expected but many respondents expected a slowdown in orders placed because of high stock levels.</p>
<p>Sales in the retail trade were slightly lower than expected and most respondents said the outlook for better sales was poor.</p>
<p>Because of high stock levels, retailers said they planned to cut back on orders placed with suppliers.</p>
<p>Vehicle sales were &quot;well down&quot; on those of a year ago and the &quot;outlook for the fourth quarter is rather bleak.&quot;</p>
<p>Many traders appeared to have been caught off guard by lower demand and were overstocked, with &quot;confidence levels dropping markedly.&quot;</p>
