<title>FRANCE: Unions plan jobs protest at French Esso, Dec 11-12.</title>
<headline>Unions plan jobs protest at French Esso, Dec 11-12.</headline>

<p>Unions are calling for disruption including possible strike action at Esso France oil refineries on December 11-12, a senior union official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The call is to protest about planned job losses at Esso and comes as refinery workers at Elf Aquitaine continue a strike that has paralysed its French refineries for over five days.</p>
<p>Esso France, a subsidiary of Exxon Corp, announced plans to cut about 10 percent of its workforce last week.</p>
<p>The company was not immediately available for comment.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have had various meetings at Esso and the inter-union group has decided to organise action at the company, and if possible across the industry, on December 11 and 12,&quot; Marc Deluzet, federal secretary for the oil branch of France's largest union, the CFDT, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The protest could include a strike, he said.</p>
<p>He also said there were tentative plans for protests over cost savings at Shell France on December 6, but these had yet to win the backing of all unions.</p>
<p>Five unions have called for industry-wide protests about job cuts and rapid reorganisation in the oil refining industry.  </p>
<p>But the call for disruption at Esso France is the first sign that unrest may spread beyond Elf, France's largest oil firm.</p>
<p>Elf unions want a plan to reduce staff numbers there to be withdrawn and are also pressing for wider demands including the same early retirement right won by French truckers last week.</p>
<p>The Elf strike, now in its sixth day, has crippled Elf's three domestic plants making up a quarter of national refining.</p>
<p>Esso is France's fourth biggest oil refiner with combined capacity of 260,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 15 percent of the French total, at two main plants. Shell is third after Elf and Total, with 270,000 bpd at its own two refineries.</p>
