<p>COFFEE: World market for June 17, 1997</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London closed sharply higher on panic commission house buying, a rebound in New York and on a lower than expected rise in GCA stock figures. July closed $139 per tonne higher at $1,890 per tonne, while September shot up by $132 to $1,910 per tonne. Traders said worries about low certifiable coffee for July delivery could allow the front- month contract to command a premium over September in the next few sessions. LIFFE new grading rules take effect with the July contract onwards.</p>
<p>Arabica futures in New York closed sharply higher. Front month July added 12.20 cents/lb to close at 208.70 cents/lb. September added 9.10 cents/lb to close at 190.70 cents/lb. Switches widened out and sentiment seemed to improve vastly. It is not excluded that benchmark September will push back over the 200 cents/lb level towards 220-225 cents/lb, as exports of arabicas are likely to come down in the coming months. Statements from Brazil that the crop will be lower than estimated by USDA aided sentiment as did yesterday's modest jump in GCA figures. Merill Lynch said the bottom line remains that certified stocks are still much smaller than the sharply reduced open interest and a further build in the stocks is not expected for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>ACPC - The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) is apparently unhappy with the latest USDA world production estimate and asked the department for clarification over the methodology of its latest coffee supply estimate. The ACPC said its members were concerned over the USDA forecast which it said differed vastly from the recent production numbers released by some governments. The USDA put Brazil's 1996/97 and 1997/98 coffee crops at 27.5 million and 28 million bags respectively. This compares with the Brazilian government estimates of 25 to 26 million and 22 million respectively, the London based ACPC said. The ACPC noted that the USDA forecast appears to be the only forecast in the market that goes against the consensus of a production drop in 1997/98.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - US certified coffee stocks fell by 500 bags on June 16 to 47,550 60-kg bags, down from 48,050 bags on June 13 but up on the 44,530 bags on June 12.</p>
<p>GERMANY - Germany imported 1.276 million bags of coffee in February 1997, nearly 31 per cent more than was imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports in the first two months of 1997 up to 2.623 million bags, 34 per cent more than was imported the same period in 1996. Total imports in calendar year 1996 rose by 5.3 per cent to 13.6 million bags. Main suppliers of green coffee in January/February 1997 were Brazil (463,200 vs 63,600 bags) and Colombia (460,500 vs 511,300 bags).</p>
<p>The country exported 657,500 bags of coffee in January/February 1997, 12 per cent more than was exported the same period in 1996. Total exports in calendar year 1996 rose by 18 per cent to 3.805 million bags.</p>
