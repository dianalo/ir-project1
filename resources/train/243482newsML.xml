<title>PHILIPPINES: Philippine court rules on SanMig directors.</title>

<p>The Philippine Supreme Court has allowed an anti-graft court to rule on a petition by industrialist Eduardo Cojuangco seeking the ouster of eight government nominees from the board of food and beer giant San Miguel Corp (SMC).</p>
<p>The high court, in a decision released on Monday, threw out an appeal by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) which contended that the anti-graft court had no authority to act on Cojuangco's petition.</p>
<p>The PCGG at present has eight nominees on the SMC's 15-man board of San Miguel Corp.</p>
<p>Cojuangco, whose shares in the food and beverage conglomerate have been sequestered by PCGG, contends the eight government nominees are not qualified to sit on the board since none of them own at least 5,000 shares of the company in their name.</p>
<p>Cojuangco says this violates company by-laws and that the PCGG also has no right to vote for the sequestered shares.</p>
<p>The PCGG is an agency charged with recovering assets which Manila claims was illegally amassed by late president Ferdinand Marcos and his business associates.</p>
<p>Cojuangco used to own 43 corporations which held majority control of San Miguel before the ousting of Marcos in a popular revolt in 1986.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court said in its ruling that while the anti-graft court normally had no jurisdication over cases involving ousting of a person from his office, &quot;it may do so as an exception as when the case involves, arises from, or related to PCGG cases over 'ill-gotten wealth'&quot; of the Marcoses.</p>
<p>The anti-graft court is yet to hear Cojuanco's petition.</p>
