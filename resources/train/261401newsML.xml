<p>Carnival Corp is shopping around Europe and elsewhere for acquisitions and partners to boost the number of passengers on its cruise ships, industry analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company -- the leader of the pleasure cruise market with 28 percent -- is said to be in talks to acquire Italy's Costa Crociere Spa.</p>
<p>Trading in Costa Corciere shares was suspended on Monday by Italian regulators until detailed information on the reported talks between the companies was revealed.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Carnival people are the most natural buyers,&quot; said industry analyst Edward Tavlin of Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;They are willing go worldwide.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for Miami-based Carnival declined to comment.</p>
<p>Last month, Carnival Chairman Micky Arison said in a Reuters interview that he saw industry consolidation continuing and that markets outside North America warranted attention.  </p>
<p>Arison did not comment directly on the possibility of acquiring Costa Crociere, a relatively small and heavily indebted line, which had been in meger talks with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.</p>
<p>Carnival has formed a joint venture with Hyundai Corp of South Korea to provide Asian cruises and bought a stake in British travel group Airtours Plc as part of its global expansion.</p>
<p>&quot;They are trying to better exploit overseas markets,&quot; analyst Jill Krutick of Smith Barney said. &quot;The North American market has lots of capacity and pricing pressure.&quot;  </p>
<p>Carnival, which runs three cruise lines, is profitable in a sector burdened with a declining customer base and the prospect of expanded capacity. The company has said it expects to post record profits for the fiscal year ended November 30.</p>
<p>To be sure, Carnival, founded 24 years ago, has miscalculated in overseas ventures in the past. The company two years ago shut down its start-up FiestaMarina line aimed at Latin Americans and exited a Bermuda hotel operation with substanial losses, Tavlin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The overseas markets are not as developed, but they have different dynamics,&quot; Krutick said. &quot;Each has its own features and characteristics.</p>
