<p>Shares in Swedish-U.S. drugs group Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn jumped on Tuesday in a rebound from last week's profit warning, and analysts said the problems faced by the group were just growing pains.</p>
<p>The P&amp;U share slid 32 crowns to 243.50 on Friday after the company warned that third quarter earnings per share would be near the $0.44 reported for the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>By 1235 GMT on Tuesday, however, the share had recovered 8.50 crowns at 247.50 on the Stockholm bourse.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were still positive on last year's merger, but Goran Kallebo, drugs analyst at Swedish brokerage Matteus, said he was disappointed that benefits from the fusion were emerging more slowly than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little bit of a disappointment for many that it's going to take a bit longer and costs will be bigger than we expected a year ago. Still I think it's an overreaction in the price. We expect a recovery in Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn.&quot;</p>
<p>Sweden's Pharmacia AB and Michigan-based Upjohn Co said at the time of their merger in August last year that restructuring costs would total $500 million over five years. Later it raised this figure to $800 million.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch analyst Janet Dyson told Reuters growth drugs such as Xalatan, for glaucoma, and bowel cancer preparation Camptosar would soon show through as higher sales and earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have to obviously see the breakdown of the figures at the end of October so we can actually see where most of the damage was done to get an idea if there was any cost benefit anywhere, and the same in the fourth quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We think the new drugs are coming through on track.&quot;</p>
<p>Paribas analyst John Reeve said uncertainty would last throughout 1996 but the merger still looked good.</p>
<p>&quot;I still think the merger looks on course. There are no real hints that the cost cutting programme in P&amp;U, the margin improvement projections, is in any doubt at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>However, investors looking for a quick profit should look elsewhere, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see any quick bounce. It's going to take the Q4 result to lift confidence...we think Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn will be a modest market underperformer until the full-year results in February.&quot;</p>
<p>Kleinwort Benson analyst Karl-Johan Bonnevier said investors needed to look at Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn without high expectations for sales growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn is to a large extent a cost-cutting exercise and in the next phase it's top line growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken analyst Stefan Wikholm said P&amp;U faced two tough years.</p>
<p>&quot;But after that we expect both the cost cutting and the new products to underpin growth,&quot; Wikholm said, adding the share could gain as much as 10 percent from current levels before it was properly valued.</p>
