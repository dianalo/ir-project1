<p>Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said Tuesday he was rejecing a law on property restitution and would send the legislation back to parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not signing this law,&quot; Brazauskas told reporters. &quot;I am returning it tomorrow with amendments.</p>
<p>The law was to regulate real estate that was nationalised by the former Soviet Union after it seized Lithuania in 1940 and how it is to be restored to its former owners.</p>
<p>The law covers the restitution of land, forests, water resevoirs, dwellings and commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Brazauskas said the law would lead residents of homes of which ownership is now in question to swamp the constitutional court with their appeals.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 10,000 people live in houses that are under question,&quot; Brazauskas said.</p>
<p>Under the law, tenants of such dwellings would have been unable to privatise their their homes.</p>
<p>Critics of the law, which parliament passed on June 5, say it is divisive and would make second-class citizens out of current tenants of homes to be returned.</p>
<p>The law's backers say it would establish continuity of property ownership prior to the 1940 Soviet occuapation.</p>
<p>Supporters say the law, which was an iniative by the ruling Homeland Union, which dominate parliaments, would leave no current occupant homeless.</p>
<p>News agency ELTA said this was the sixth time Brazauskas has vetoed a law in the new parliament and that parliament four times passed laws and rejected the president's proposals.</p>
