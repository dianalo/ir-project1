<p>------------------------- Dec 6 ----------------------------</p>
<p>* Index ends down 23.88 points (0.75 pct) at 3,139.45</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Manila stocks finished in negative territory on Friday despite inching higher at the open as investors opted to take profits following a sharp runup the previous day, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was across-the-board profit taking as the market was able to break through its resistance level on Thursday,&quot; Teresa Lee, assistant vice-president Lippo Securities said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the new support was seen at 3,100 points.  </p>
<p>Traders said most issues led by blue chips such as San Miguel Corp which gained in the past few days took a breather on Friday.</p>
<p>Small cap issues like Philippine Realty and Holdings also succumbed to profit taking.</p>
<p>Except for the oil and financial sector, all other sectors fell. Losers outpaced gainers 74 to 41 with 64 shares unchanged.</p>
<p>The market is seen facing continued selling next week as the index will test a resistance level of 3,100 points.</p>
