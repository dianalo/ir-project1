<headline>3M reports record profits for quarter, stock jumps.</headline>
<dateline>ST. PAUL, Minn.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. Tuesday reported record operating profits for the fourth quarter and the full year, despite currency fluctuations that cut into its results.</p>
<p>The St. Paul, Minn.-based company, whose business interests range from speciality chemicals to medical supplies, said it earned $375 million, or 90 cents a share, on sales of $3.62 billion in the latest quarter vs. year-earlier profits of $266 million, or 63 cents, a share on sales of $3.30 billion. The year-ago results exclude a one-time, pre-tax restructuring charge of $79 million, or 12 cents a share.</p>
<p>The company, which generates more than half of its sales abroad, said currency fluctuations trimmed its earnings for the quarter by about 4 cents a share.</p>
<p>Following the news, 3M's stock rose $2.875 to $84.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;The strong momentum in 3M's financial performance continues,&quot; said 3M Chairman L.D. DeSimone. &quot;Double-digit volume growth in the United States and abroad and healthy productivity gains drove our record fourth-quarter results.&quot;</p>
<p>DeSimone said, &quot;We expect solid sales and earnings growth again in 1997.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said that in the United States, it had solid growth, with strong gains posted in speciality chemicals, electronic connectors, medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Internationally, 3M reported double-digit volume gains in all major geographic areas.</p>
