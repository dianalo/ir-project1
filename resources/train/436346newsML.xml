<p>Hong Kong's budget for the fiscal year straddling its handover to China was not affected by Beijing's participation in its preparation, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang and his team said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In the whole preparatory process, the initiatives have been taken by the departments and branches within the Hong Kong government,&quot; said Treasury Secretary K.C. Kwong, who led multiple rounds of talks on the budget with Chinese experts.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day, consensus was reached in the budget expert group, and I think this is a budget which represents what we would have done with or without the Chinese participation,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Beijing has promised Hong Kong economic autonomy after it reverts to China at midnight of June 30. But because the budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year starting on April 1 straddles the handover, Beijing insisted on a hand in its preparation.</p>
<p>Tsang said Beijing's participation did not affect Hong Kong's budgetary habits.</p>
<p>&quot;We have abided by our budgetary guidelines and principles throughout the process, we have not made any sacrifices at all on matters of principle during our consultation process (with Chinese experts),&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Hong Kong was &quot;spending to the hilt&quot;, boosting recurrent expenditures by about five percent in line with the economic growth trend, including an increase in welfare spending, Tsang said.</p>
<p>Chinese officials have previously accused Hong Kong of spending too much on welfare.</p>
<p>Tsang acknowledged the transition meant Hong Kong tried to be especially careful in drawing up the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We are quite anxious to make sure that the (future Special Administrative Region) government will come into being with...a very robust financial position, and that is the reason we are rather cautious,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tsang also noted many people had predicted the budget process would not be as smooth as usual because of Chinese participation, but he said it turned out to be quite smooth.</p>
<p>&quot;What is particularly heartening is that we are working with the Chinese side on something so politically sensitive, and the outcome and the result is acceptable and satisfactory to all parties,&quot; Tsang said.</p>
