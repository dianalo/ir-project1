<headline>Danish bonds up ahead of Greenspan, levels to hold.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-07-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish bond prices rose in a quiet market, echoing advances on other European markets, with dealers predicting that levels would hold ahead of the evening's Humphrey Hawkins speech by U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>&quot;It is foreign markets which are forcing prices moderately up. We are just folllowing suit with little activity seen before Greenspan,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 was up 0.19 point from the opening at 114.13, yielding 5.86 percent. The upcoming seven percent 2007 benchmark rose 0.21 point to 106.97, with yield at 6.06 percent.  </p>
<p>Turnover in the 2006 and 2007 tone-setters was 1.6 billion and around one billion crowns respectively.</p>
<p>The 2006's September future rose 0.27 point to 113.50 with only one contract traded. The six percent mortgage bond due 2026 gained 0.18 point to 92.13. The crown traded at an unchanged 3.8075 per mark at 1135 GMT.</p>
<p>The 2007's 10-year yield gap with Germany was unaltered at 53 basis points. The Central Bank was active on the market selling a small amount of seven percent 2007 and seven percent 2024 bonds as part of its routine financing operations.</p>
