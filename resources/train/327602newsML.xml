<text>
<p>Major European bourses climbed to record levels on Thursday as a strong opening on Wall Street bolstered earlier gains inspired by favourable currency movements.</p>
<p>London stocks stormed ahead over one percent to a new trading peak as a suddenly weakening pound boosted prospects for exporting companies after the currency's recent steep gains.</p>
<p>Frankfurt closed at an all-time high as the dollar dug in at a 2-1/2 year peak against the mark, helping German exporters. Paris also broke into uncharted territory, led by a boom in financial shares.</p>
<p>London was the star in Europe's latest bull run thanks to the pound. The FTSE index surged to 4,264.1 points, more than one percent above the previous trading best set on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sterling took a pounding overnight in Asia as a big sell-off dragged it sharply lower from Wednesday's 52-month record against the mark. It recovered to 2.6728 marks by mid-afternoon, still nearly five pfennigs below its 2.7240 high of yesterday.</p>
<p>The pound's recent strength was sapped by growing hopes that British interest rates would remain unchanged and this took pressure off overseas-earning and exporting companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The theme of today has been sterling,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;It's helped the dollar earners which has pushed the market higher, and some sectors are being squeezed again.&quot;</p>
<p>Sectors which had taken the brunt of the damage from sterling's strength in recent weeks led the market's charge, with pharmaceuticals, engineering and drinks shares among the day's best performers.</p>
<p>Sterling's decline comes after months of sharp gains as the prospect of rising British interest rates sucked speculative cash into the currency.</p>
<p>But Wednesday's weaker-than-expected British retail sales data changed currency dealers' minds, suggesting British rates could be on hold until after the election due by May.</p>
<p>The bullish mood was also encouraged by a positive start in New York where shares bounced back after ending in the minus column on Wednesday, weighed down by tumbling IBM shares.</p>
<p>French shares, which hit a record close on Wednesday, also perked up after early losses to hit a new trading peak of 2,463.91 on the CAC-40 index, encouraged by Wall Street's 0.6 percent gain and strength in financial stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a new wave of buying on the financial stocks,&quot; one trader in Paris said.</p>
<p>Financial stocks climbed strongly after Societe Generale upped its 1996 profit forecast. Axa, BNP, CCFand Paribas were among big gainers.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares fell at the start of bourse trade following the latest German money supply data which came out slightly higher than expected, scotching hopes of a quick interest rate cut.</p>
<p>But the DAX share index clawed back the losses to close at a record 3,033.46 points. Frankfurt has benefited greatly from the stronger dollar because of the large number of exporting firms listed.</p>
<p>With the main focus of the currency markets on sterling, the dollar was largely unchanged against the mark and made modest gains on the yen by midafternoon but some traders voiced doubts about how long its bull run would last.</p>
<p>Although the currency did not seem to have reached the end of its rally, it was due for a consolidation, traders said. Sterling's plunge and the mark's recovery against other European units could prove to be an opportunity for the dollar to settle down.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling's acting as a millstone around the dollar's neck right now. The battering that sterling/mark got has boosted the mark relative to the dollar,&quot; said David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar surged to 119.45 yen and 1.6397 marks from Wednesday's late European levels of 118.91 and 1.6393.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 49.2 points at 4,268.3.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was 20.53 higher at 2,462.99.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 4.79 at 3,033.46. PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $348.00 an ounce in the afternoon, compared to Wednesday's close of $351.15. Silver was two cents stronger at $4.75.</p>
