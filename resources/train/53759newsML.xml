<headline>RBI to seek to cut India banks' cash reserve ratio.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank, on Friday said it would strive to cut the cash reserve ratio for banks which it has been using for years as a key instrument of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;As part of a concerted policy, there is an effort to move away from the use of reserve requirements, particularly the cash reserve ratio (CRR),&quot; RBI said in its annual report for 1995/96 (July to June) released on Friday.</p>
<p>RBI said it considered open market operations a better way of signalling changes in monetary policy aimed at inflation control, which it said was one of its prime objectives.</p>
<p>The effective CRR has already been reduced to 11.5 percent in July 1996 from 15.7 percent in March 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the CRR is a heavy tax on the banking system, efforts need to be made to bring about further reductions in the CRR without jeopardising monetary stability,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>RBI said a high CRR and high refinance limits presented a distorted picuture. &quot;There is much merit in reducing reserve requirements and reducing refinance limits.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a rationalisation would not inhibit the banks' capacity to finance preferred sectors of the economy, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;With a low CRR and low refinance, open market operations would be a more effective instrument for signalling monetary policy changes, particularly in short periods,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>As the Indian market developed depth and more financial instruments came into existence, monetary policy would be more effective in achieving price stability and transacation volumes would become more sensitive to interest rate changes, RBI said.</p>
<p>Fiscal and monetary policies would be committed to inflation control as one of the most important policy objectives, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be the duty of monetary policy to ensure that inflation is kept low, not just as an end in itself but as a means to promote sustained and equitable growth,&quot; RBI said.</p>
<p>It said the hardening of interest rates during 1995/96 (April-March) was a matter of serious concern.</p>
<p>&quot;With the decline in the inflation rate, the real rates of interest are in double digits which is clearly unsustainable, given the expected growth of the economy,&quot; RBI said.</p>
<p>The persistence of high nominal and real interest rates gave an impression that the long term inflation expectations continue to remain high, the RBI annual report said.</p>
<p>This impression, it said, was erroneous as the rate of inflation was less than 8.0 percent per annum.</p>
<p>A sustained improvement in the price situation would give signals to the markets that inflation expectations are exaggerated and and nominal interest rates would eventually decline, RBI said in a summary of its annual report.</p>
