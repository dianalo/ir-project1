<p>The following stories appeared in Wednesday's Daily Variety:</p>
<p>* NEW YORK - Viacom Inc agreed to sell its radio station group for $1.075 billion to Evergreen Media Corp. Evergreen is merging with radio group Chancellor Broadcasting Co in a $567 million stock deal. The combined company will be Chancellor Media Corp and will be the biggest pure radio broadcaster in the country, although Westinghouse Electric Group's CBS Inc. will continue to be the No.1 radio group in the country.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - Sen. Joseph Lieberman has asked high-level executives from the Big Six record companies to a meeting Friday to discuss the state of the music industry. The agenda is anticipated to be wide-ranging but could focus on Universal's half-interest in Interscope Records, which Bennett claims releases albums with objectionable content. Universal is owned by Seagram Co Ltd.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - The battle between News Corp and Walt Disney over the suitability and future of Fox Sports West 2 regional sports cable network is poised to get ugly. Disney fired the first salvo at Fox two weeks ago when its Mighty Ducks hockey team filed suit against the network for taking it off Fox Sports West and relegating the team's games to FSW2. Fox's lineup change has met with a significant backlash from major cable operators in southern California, who have been refusing to pay hefty fees to carry the second channel since its launch on Jan. 27.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - Ted Harbert, who on Saturday became chairman of Disney's ABC Entertainment, has signed an exclusive production deal with DreamWorks Network Television. The multi-million dollar, two-and-a-half-year deal calls for Harbert to become an executive producer on Arsenio, DreamWorks' midseason comedy for ABC.</p>
<p>* HOLLYWOOD - Swingers star Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix have signed for the dark noir comedy &quot;In Too Deep&quot; for Scott Free Prods. &quot;In Too Deep,&quot; in the tradition of &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Blood Simple,&quot; is about the complications that arise when a guy's best friend stages his suicide and then frames his buddy for the crime.</p>
<p>* LONDON - Channel 5, which is to be launched March 30, will schedule a program lineup designed on U.S. lines with shows stripped across the week and about 40 percent of the programming acquired from U.S. producers. The channel's executives said they hoped the new station's strongest selling point would be a 9 p.m. movie screened daily.</p>
