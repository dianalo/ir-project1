<p>Juergen Klinsmann showed his determination to help Bayern Munich to another German league title despite his imminent departure with a superb goal in a crucial 3-0 victory at Hansa Rostock on Friday.</p>
<p>Just a few hours after Sampdoria announced that the German captain was joining the Italian club next season, Klinsmann effectively sealed three points for Bayern when he struck the second goal in the 56th minute.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant effort. Klinsmann controlled a pass superbly with his upper body, sprinted to the right side of the box and fired the ball inside the far, left-hand post.</p>
<p>The victory gave Bayern a four-point lead at the top over Bayer Leverkusen with two games remaining. Leverkusen, who have a game in hand, have a chance to narrow the gap when they meet struggling St Pauli at home on Saturday.</p>
<p>German international wing back Christian Ziege, who is also leaving Bayern at the end of the season to join AC Milan, put the Bavarians ahead with a header in the 33rd minute. Midfielder Mehmet Scholl hit the third in the 62nd.</p>
<p>The result came just at the right time for Bayern, who seemed to be losing their nerve in the championship race.</p>
<p>&quot;Bayern are back. That was an important step we took today,&quot; midfielder Mario Basler said.</p>
<p>In the night's other match Fortuna Duesseldorf's hopes of staying in the top flight suffered a major setback when they were beaten 3-0 at home by Karlsruhe.</p>
