<p>LIFFE cocoa futures were unable to sustain slim gains and headed mostly lower by midsesion on Monday.</p>
<p>All positions opened a few sterling higher as expected but sellers soon emerged as follow-through buying from Friday failed to materialise.</p>
<p>In addition to the summer lull, players were also being sidelined by the gyrations in the currency markets. The pound sterling lost some ground against the dollar this morning while the dollar stormed to 7-1/2 year peaks against the mark.</p>
<p>Traders said the surge in the dollar could prompt further arbitrage selling in New York against the sterling-denominated London futures.</p>
<p>London's benchmark September gapped two stg higher at 994 stg a tonne at the start. It then slipped back to trade two stg lower by the end of the morning business after a low of 987.</p>
<p>Other position were three up two stg lower.</p>
<p>Volume totalled just 784 lots, led by September.</p>
<p>Chartwise, analysts said the September contract faced an uphill task to clear the immediate 1,000 stg resistance.</p>
<p>A key support is pegged at last week's low of 965.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, traders said the main 1997/98 Ivorian crop is said to be developing well and early forecasts point to another good crop at more than 1.0 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks fine as far as the crop is concerned. I think the market might come down further,&quot; said one trader.</p>
