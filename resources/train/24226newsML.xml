<p>The timing was precise, the orders crisp and the AK-47 assault rifles they fired with deadly accuracy overnight in this sleepy town had Mexicans sure of one thing on Thursday: these rebels were for real.</p>
<p>After two months of being dismissed by the Mexican government as a mere &quot;pantomime,&quot; the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) in one turbulent night on Wednesday established its guerrilla credentials in blood.</p>
<p>In six different states, it launched coordinated attacks on police and army barracks or staged propaganda acts. At least 12 people were killed and 22 wounded -- the first time the EPR has launched anything beyond small-scale attacks on military or police convoys since it first appeared on June 28.</p>
<p>Another -- and just as serious -- casualty for many here was the long-held hope that Mexico could solve a stack of economic and political problems, including a deep economic recession, without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Outside the local police station in Tixtla, an hour's drive north of Guerrero's glitzy Pacific tourist resort of Acapulco, the blood on the sidewalk was that of a policeman, gunned down as he tried to defend himself with an ancient rifle.</p>
<p>Another policeman had his legs shot off as he sat at his desk inside. He later bled to death.</p>
<p>Witnesses said some 30 gunmen, their faces covered with bandannas and wearing khaki uniforms, swept into the main square in combat formation and opened fire on police.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't believe in them at all, but seeing them I realised that the guerrillas do exist,&quot; said Felipe Epitazio, a policeman who traded fire with the rebels from a doorway, but found himself outnumbered and seriously outgunned.</p>
<p>&quot;They are fanatical and dedicated, they have killing in their hearts ... it was a commando that knew about strategy and guerrilla war,&quot; added Epitazio.</p>
<p>Residents who crouched in shops as the gunbattle raged said it was clear the rebels were well-disciplined. They ordered civilians to flee, saying they were only after police and soldiers.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the masked rebels hardly said a word before vanishing, leaving behind them bullet-pocked buildings, spent cartridges and a feeling things in this part of Mexico have been brutally shaken up.</p>
<p>In Huatulco, a popular Pacific resort city in southern Oaxaca state, guerrillas attacked a police office, a naval base, the town hall and another public building, killing seven and wounding seven in the surprise attacks.</p>
<p>An eerie quiet enveloped the sprawling resort on Thursday. The guerrillas deliberately pinpointed the tourist end of town for maximum effect, market stall holder Griselda Gomez said.</p>
<p>&quot;They wanted to create as much attention as they could and they did, we have had soldiers and armed police crawling all over the place all day,&quot; the wrinkled grandmother added.</p>
<p>A convoy of army trucks sat on a nearby road. Nervous soldiers posted at each corner of the vehicles scrutinised the thick undergrowth, their rifles cocked at the ready.</p>
<p>But there seemed little panic among the estimated 10,000 tourists currently in the resort. &quot;To tell you the truth I did not know anything had happened,&quot; said John Crawley, a 40-year-old computer technician from New Jersey.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard a few people mention a gun battle over lunch but I had no idea that it was right here ... now I know what all the young soldiers are doing dotted around the town.&quot;</p>
