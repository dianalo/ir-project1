<p>Graco Inc said Friday it does not expect sales to grow as rapidly in the second half of 1997 as they did in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The fluid management technology company reported net sales for the three months ended June 27 of $111.7 million, up 15 percent from the same period last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we are optimistic about the balance of the year, we do not expect to record double digit sales increases during the third and fourth quarters,&quot; said chief executive George Aristides. &quot;The sales momentum that we reported at the end of the first quarter of 1997 continued in the second quarter, leading to record quarterly sales and earnings.&quot;  </p>
<p>The company reported second-quarter net earnings of $10.4 million or $0.60 per share, up four percent over net earnings of $10 million or $0.57 per share in the 1996 second quarter.</p>
<p>Worldwide, industrial/automotive equipment sales increased nine percent from last year's second quarter. Contractor equipment sales increased 27 percent due to strong performance and changes in the timing of marketing promotional programs. Lubrication equipment sales grew nine percent, Graco said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the exception of Japan and worldwide automotive, we were pleased with business activity during the second quarter,&quot; Aristides said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our backlog of $25.3 million has grown by $6.1 million since the beginning of the year and the current rate of incoming orders is satisfactory,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Second quarter sales in the Americas increased 19 percent to $75.9 million, and European sales increased 29 percent to $21.9 million. In Asia Pacific, sales decreased 13 percent from last year's second quarter, to $13.9 million, Graco said.</p>
<p>In a separate matter, Graco commented on a patent infringement lawsuit filed against it by Nordson Corp. Graco said, &quot;The facts clearly demonstrate that our PrecisionFlo product does not infringe on Nordson's patent and we will vigorously defend this case. The PrecisionFlo product is a very small portion of our overall sales.&quot;</p>
