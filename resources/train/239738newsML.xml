<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday taxation should amount to no more than 30-32 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>A normal level of taxation was no higher than 30-32 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and Russia should have an even lower level towards 2000, he told the Duma lower house of parliament before a debate on the draft 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Estimates of government taxation and spending as a percent of GDP vary widely, depending in part on which semi-governmental organisations such as the state pension fund are included, though some analysts put spending higher than 50 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin also said real estate and means of transport should be taxed.</p>
<p>&quot;Those in such businesses should pay,&quot; Chernomyrdin said. He did not give details.</p>
<p>Outlining goals of economic reform, Chernomyrdin called for the pace of tax reform to be quickened and for more owed taxes to be gathered in order to lower tax rates.</p>
<p>Russia gathered only 70 percent of targeted taxes in the first 11 months of this year, and is likely to raise only 75 percent over the year as a whole, deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov said last week.</p>
<p>A new and simpler tax code prepared largely by the Finance Ministry is being worked on in committee in the Duma.</p>
