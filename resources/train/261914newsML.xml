<p>Norway on Tuesday strongly condemned the killing of six foreign aid workers, including two Norwegian women, in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal said the killings early on Tuesday posed a serious setback for humanitarian work in the war-ravaged region.</p>
<p>&quot;It is with deep sorrow and shock that we receive the news about the murder of two Norwegian and four foreign aid workers at the Chechnya hospital of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),&quot; Godal said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly condemn this deed. Everything must be done to find the perpetrators and put them on trial.&quot;</p>
<p>The Norwegian victims were identified by the Norwegian Red Cross as Ingebjoerg Foss, 42, and Gunnhild Myklebust, 55, both of whom were surgical nurses.</p>
<p>The national news agency NTB said the women were believed to be the first Norwegian Red Cross workers to be killed on duty.</p>
<p>Foss had previously been a Red Cross worker in Nicaragua and Pakistan. Myklebust, who is survived by four children aged 18 to 27, worked in Bosnia last year.</p>
<p>The other four Red Cross workers who died came from the Netherlands, Canada, Spain and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The perpetrators carry a heavy responsibility for the serious humanitarian setback we are now experiencing in an area where tens of thousands have lost their lives in the bloody conflict and where the civilian population still has a desperate need for help,&quot; Godal said.</p>
