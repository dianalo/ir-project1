<p>President Clinton said Tuesday it was important to complete work on an agreement to balance the budget, despite a dramatic drop in the deficit.</p>
<p>Clinton, who just returned from a trip to Europe, told Republican and Democratic lawmakers at a White House meeting on the budget the &quot;first order of business is to go on with the work of balancing the budget.&quot;  </p>
<p>Clinton said the agreement between the White House and Republicans who control Congress calls for some $900 billion in spending cuts over five years. Clinton also said that the agreed entitlement reforms were needed to protect the Medicare health program for the elderly and other programs.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea that we don't have to do anything I think is dead wrong,&quot; Clinton said, adding that passing another budget agreement would strengthen confidence in the U.S. economy and keep the expansion going.  </p>
<p>Clinton said that some people were beginning to argue that since the deficit has dropped dramatically witht the growing economy, it would disappear without further Congressional action.</p>
<p>&quot;I emphatically disagree with that,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Clinton said White House Budget Director Frank Raines told him that the budget would not balance without further action.  </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said that the &quot;atmosphere was good&quot; surrounding the negotiations on the tax and spending plan.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made real good progress in the last month,&quot; Lott said. He said lawmakers were committed to completing their work and getting legislation ready for Clinton to sign by August 1.</p>
