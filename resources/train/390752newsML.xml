<p>A court on Thursday ordered Poland's ruling party of ex-communists to submit a detailed account of its assets and swear it is telling the truth -- a move designed to make it pay its debts, PAP news agency said.</p>
<p>The Warsaw regional court upheld a motion by liquidators of the vast wealth amassed at public cost by the undemocratic old communist party, which lost power in 1989 and changed into the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SdRP).</p>
<p>The official liquidators have found that the SdRP wrongly took over various communist party assets which should have gone to the state, such as buildings and cars which it sold, estimated at about 20 million zlotys ($6.6 million).</p>
<p>The party has failed to pay this debt, pleading poverty.</p>
<p>Each time liquidators have swooped on its accounts these have indeed been empty, although the party collects hefty dues from most of its 60,000 members and has spent heavily on election campaigns.</p>
<p>The SdRP, core grouping of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), defeated parties rooted in the pre-1989 opposition at general elections in 1993 and has been in power ever since in coalition with a Peasant party.</p>
<p>It faces new elections this September and opinion polls show an alliance of right-leaning parties grouped around the Solidarity union is ahead of it in popular standings.</p>
<p>The court's verdict is subject to appeal, PAP said.</p>
