<p>The bodies of two teenage girls were found in a West Bank nature reserve near Jerusalem, the apparent victims of a Palestinian guerrilla attack, Israeli radio said.</p>
<p>Police said there were signs the girls had been stabbed and dragged. There was no immediate police confirmation of a motive.</p>
<p>&quot;We are speaking about a murder that apparently happened about two to three days ago, a murder by stabbing,&quot; Eli Aharoni, a police commander in the area, told Israel army radio.</p>
<p>&quot;They were killed close to where they were discovered. They had been thrown into the water apparently to cover up where they are found,&quot; Aharoni said.</p>
<p>The bodies were found by hikers in the Wadi Kelt nature reserve, a popular West Bank tourist site.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw signs of dragging,&quot; Ami Giat, one of the hikers who found the bodies, told Israel radio. &quot;There were signs that they were stabbed, certainly from a knife, in the neck.&quot;</p>
<p>In July 1995 (corrects from 1993), two Israelis were found in the Wadi Kelt area shot and stabbed to death in an apparent Arab guerrilla attack. In October 1993, Palestinian guerrillas killed two Israeli hikers in Wadi Kelt.</p>
