<p>The planned merger of Polish paintmakers Polifarb Cieszyn and Polifarb Wroclaw is still likely despite a possible protest by a mutual shareholder, a Wroclaw official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wroclaw deputy president Wladyslaw Burczak told Reuters that BIG SA could protest in court Cieszyn's Monday decision to effect the merger slightly in Cieszyn shareholders' favour, though some compromise might be reached beforehand.</p>
<p>&quot;There could be an obstruction but I think there probably won't be because that would create a stalemate situation and lengthen the (merger) process, which our managements don't want...because that costs,&quot; Burczak told Reuters.</p>
<p>At a Cieszyn shareholders meeting on Monday three subsidiaries of BIG SA, whose full name is Bank Inicjatyw Gospodarczych SA, said they might challenge in court the meeting's decision giving Cieszyn shareholders 53.5 percent of the prospective new firm.</p>
<p>They would receive that amount, rather than the previously planned 50 percent, by increasing a pre- merger bonus issue to 6.375 million shares from 2.98 million.</p>
<p>On Wednesday BIG, whose subsidiaries hold about six percent of Cieszyn shares and 7.5 percent of Wroclaw, declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Burczak said the two Polifarbs' legal adviser was studying whether Cieszyn's decision was legally binding and could present its opinion next week.</p>
<p>BIG subisidiary BIG Finance Sp zoo is advising on the merger, which the firms would like to effect at mid-year.</p>
<p>Analysts also said the merger would likely take place.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be strange if BIG torpedoed the whole merger because it was the driving force of the merger,&quot; said Remigiusz Tarka, an analyst at IB Austria Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts say the two Polifarbs, which together would hold a 26-percent market share, could lose market share to strong domestic and foreign competition if they did not combine.</p>
