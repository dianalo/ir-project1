<title>UK: Copper slides back on LME, finishes easier.</title>
<headline>Copper slides back on LME, finishes easier.</headline>

<p>Copper prices turned lower during Friday afternoon LME trading, with some profit-taking seen against a background of a slight easing in the spread backwardation.</p>
<p>The rest of the complex followed suit, although the undercurrent of tightness that is percolating from copper into aluminium and zinc helped prevent any sizeable decline, traders said.</p>
<p>In copper, most interest was focussed on the spreads, with cash/threes hitting a $300 premium at one point before settling back at $280/285.</p>
<p>Stocks also rose by a larger-than-expected 12,775 tonnes, an increase that reflected recent high backwardations. Thus the three months market once again stalled below the $2,280 overhead objective.</p>
<p>But the setback is likely to be temporary, given the approach of the Jan 29/early-Feb tight prompt dates.</p>
<p>An Asian trade house is believed to be short by some 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes of copper, although traders are unsure how much has been covered or rolled forward.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one wants to be short in this market - there is going to be a lot of fun and games when they cover those positions,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>Last three months business on Friday was at $2,243 a tonne, down $34 from Thursday.</p>
<p>Aluminium's declines were fairly small, given the forward borrowing interest and expectations of significant drawdowns in LME stocks in coming weeks. There are backwardations from the second quarter onwards, while the cash/threes contango has shrunk to $20 this week from around $30.</p>
<p>Nickel prices came under late selling pressure as well, falling back to the day's lows despite a solid inventory drawdown. Last trade was at $7,300, down $85.</p>
<p>Zinc continued to correct lower after the recent run-up to 23-month lows, but emerging forward tightness is likely to see the market resume advances soon. Last business was at $1,139, down $12.</p>
<p>Lead buckled under late profit-taking, although there was some underlying suppprt around the $700 level. Last trade was at $699, down $13.</p>
<p>Tin managed to hold downside suppprt at a key psychological level as well, with prices standing fast at $6,000. Last trade was at $6,020, a $30 loss.</p>
<p>The alloy market closed at $1,532/35, little changed from overnight levels.</p>
