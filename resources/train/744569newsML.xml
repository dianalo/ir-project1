<p>Fresh from a brewery conquest in Central and Eastern Europe, South African Breweries is fixing its eye on its home continent -- potentially posing a threat to a 75-year-old brewer in neighbouring Namibia.</p>
<p>SAB, which already has operations dotted across Africa and is having talks in Angola, Ghana and Ethiopia, recently handed a proposal to the Namibian government to build a 100 million rand ($22 million) production plant in the northern town of Oshakati.</p>
<p>With a planned capacity of 250,000 hectolitres of beer a year, the brewery could swallow up to 40 percent of the former German colony's estimated market, until now dominated by Namibian Breweries (NamBrew).</p>
<p>But before the first brick is laid SAB will have the tough task of persuading the Namibian government to allow it to open shop. Fiercely protective of its home brewer, Namibia has blocked previous such attempts by the world's fifth biggest brewer.</p>
<p>NamBrew, which manufactures around 0.8 million hectolitres of beer a year compared with SAB's massive 35 million, has said that a new production facility could force it to shut down one of its two breweries, sparking job losses in a country with a major unemployment problem.</p>
<p>But industry analysts say that semi-arid Namibia, heavily reliant on its agricultural sector and desperately in need of manufacturing diversification, may find it difficult to cold-shoulder SAB this time.</p>
<p>The proposal from the South African firm, which controls a massive 97 percent of its home market and is the largest brewer in Poland, Hungary and Romania, offers a 51 percent stake in the facility to Namibian businessmen. SAB will hold the rest.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be felt that another refusal will prejudice these businessmen,&quot; one beverages analyst said.</p>
<p>SAB's latest attempt to move into Namibia may put further strain on its already frosty relations with NamBrew. The two recently locked horns in an advertising battle over whose brewing methods were the best, resulting in both having to withdraw their campaigns.</p>
<p>NamBrew prides itself on brewing beer according to ancient Bavarian purity law which requires natural fermentation. SAB does not follow this Reinheitsgebot, sparking pub talk that it adds nasty chemicals to its beers to speed up the brewing process.</p>
<p>It has not helped that NamBrew's flagship brand Windhoek Lager has becoming increasingly fashionable amongst young and well-heeled South Africans, previously loyal drinkers of SAB's big Castle or Amstel brands.</p>
<p>Although growing Windhoek Lager sales remain a pinprick to SAB commercially, some feel SAB's drive into Namibia has been sparked by its desire to punish the irritating upstart.</p>
<p>&quot;A look around the local pub will show more people are switching to Windhoek as it is a more robust drinking beer,&quot; said a recent letter to a financial daily.</p>
<p>&quot;I do believe SAB is worried, hence its attempted foray into Namibia,&quot; the writer said.</p>
<p>SAB denies this, saying the Namibia move forms part of its exploration of beverage-related opportunities in mass consumer markets in developing countries. It already has a presence in Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Zambia and Mozambique.</p>
<p>Analysts also say that a brewery in northern Namibia will be a good launching pad for beer exports to Angola. Although sAB has signed an agreement to set up a brewery there, it has expressed concern about that country's political situation.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Africa, SAB has said that it is keen to press ahead with a $40 million brewery in Ethiopia. It is also evaluating a move into West Africa with Ghana seen as a potential first base.</p>
