<headline>Russian MinFins rise after US PPI, ahead Eurobond.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-06-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds rose as U.S. May producer price index figures strengthened the market's hopes another U.S. interest rate hike is unlikely over the next few weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>			tranche   June 13		 June 11</p>
<p>    1999 maturity   (3)     89.75-89.95	   89.15-89.45</p>
<p>    2003 maturity   (4)     66.50-66.70	   65.10-65.40</p>
<p>    2008 maturity   (5)     47.55-47.75	   46.25-46.55</p>
<p>    2006 maturity   (6)     53.50-53.70	   52.20-52.50</p>
<p>    2011 maturity   (7)     41.05-41.25	   40.05-40.35</p>
<p>MinFins, like other emerging debt, are sensitive to any news which would suggest a change in U.S. interest rates and consequently affect U.S. Treasury bond prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday PPI dropped 0.3 percent in May after a 0.6 percent drop in April. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI to rise 0.1 percent in May.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had some friendly figures today and the market is in a very bullish tone. With these data people are convinced we will not have another U.S. interest rate hike,&quot; Eurobank dealer Olivier Coursault said.</p>
<p>The next Federal Open Market Committee policy-making meeting is due on July 1 and July 2.</p>
<p>Dealers said the forthcoming issue of Russia's next Eurobond boosted demand for other Russian assets.</p>
<p>Russia's Deputy Finance Mnister Mikhail Kasyanov said on Monday Russia's June Eurobond is likely to have a 10-year maturity and be for at least $1.0 billion. The road-show is ending on June 18.</p>
