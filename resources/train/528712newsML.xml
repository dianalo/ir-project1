<p>India's new Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Tuesday lodged a motion of confidence in his centre-left government in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Gujral, India's fourth prime minister in less than a year, was expected to win the vote by a wide margin as the Congress party has pledged to support his one-day-old government. The vote was expected by 6 p.m. (1230 GMT), house speaker P.A. Sangma said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I move that this House expresses its confidence in the council of ministers,&quot; Gujral said.</p>
<p>Gujral took power on Monday after three weeks of political crisis, and assured industry and investors that it would be &quot;business as usual&quot; under his regime.</p>
<p>His predecessor, H.D. Deve Gowda, fell on April 11 when he lost a vote of confidence by a lopsided margin. The vote was triggered by Congress's decision to revoke support for Deve Gowda's government. Congress accused Deve Gowda of trying to sideline India's oldest party.</p>
<p>Gujral's 15-party United Front coalition has 178 legislators in the 542-member lower house, the Lok Sabha. Congress has 140, and the biggest single party, the rightwing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), controls 193 votes.</p>
