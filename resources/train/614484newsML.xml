<headline>Czech PX50 closes down led by major issues.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-05-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Czech PX50 took another battering on Monday with three of the five most heavily capitalised shares posting heavy losses which pushed the index down 1.1 percent to 478.7.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was IPB Bank which lost 21 crowns, or 7.3 percent of its value to close at 266.</p>
<p>Analysts said that IPB's fall was due to local newspaper reports that an investment fund was claiming 1.25 billion crowns from the bank in connection with a dispute over the sale of shares in Kreditni Banka and Agrobanka at the beginning of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;It is just because of these reports,&quot; said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostneska Banka.</p>
<p>Other major issues also fell sharply. SPT Telecom lost 70 crowns, 2.4 percent, to 2,900, and CEZ dropped 43 crowns, 4.5 percent, to 905.</p>
<p>Komercni Banka rose nine crowns to 1,810 but lost most of its early gains and Ceska Sporitelna closed up 12 crowns to 282.</p>
