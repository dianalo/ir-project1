<p>The Cuban government on Saturday announced the creation of a new central bank that will regulate monetary and credit policy and oversee a more modern and diversified Cuban banking sector.</p>
<p>The Banco Central de Cuba, created through Decree Law 172 passed by Cuba's ruling Council of State on May 28, will replace the Banco Nacional de Cuba, which was originally founded as the Caribbean island's central bank in 1948.</p>
<p>The reorganization, announced in an article published on Saturday by the official Cuban Communist Party daily Granma, follows two years of gradual reforms in the Cuban banking sector that have created a new diversified structure of banks and financial institutions on the communist-ruled island.</p>
<p>Granma said the aim of the latest reform was to &quot;create an exclusive central bank entity, capable of contributing in an effective manner to the economic and financial transformations that are taking place in the country.&quot; While it carried out government economic policy, the new bank would nevertheless be autonomous and have separate legal identity, the paper said.</p>
<p>Since shortly after the 1959 Cuban Revolution until now, Banco Nacional de Cuba had held a dual responsibility as both central bank and commercial bank. It was a lynchpin of the Soviet-style economy that existed while Cuba was a member of the Soviet-led trading bloc Comecon.</p>
<p>The reorganization separates the two banking functions, setting up the new stand-alone central bank to be headed by Francisco Soberon Valdes, formerly the president of the Banco Nacional de Cuba. Soberon, the main architect of the banking reforms, has the rank of minister.</p>
<p>The banking changes are part of cautious, modernizing reforms introduced by Cuba's communist government in its efforts to haul the economy out of a deep recession triggered by the collapse of economic ties with the former Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>Banco Nacional de Cuba will continue to exist as a commercial bank but would remain responsible for the control and servicing of Cuba's foreign debt, which Soberon said last week totalled $10.4 billion, including Paris Club debt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the new Banco Central de Cuba would be in charge of debt negotiations on behalf of the Cuban state.</p>
<p>Its other functions included issuing national currency, regulating money supply and interest rates, setting exchange rate policy and supervising the national banking system.</p>
<p>Another Decree Law passed by the Council of State, number 173, created a general register of banks and financial institutions in Cuba. This law also regulated the operation of such entities once they obtained central bank licences.</p>
<p>Seven new Cuban banks and a series of financial institutions have been created over the last two years as part of the banking reforms introduced by Soberon. They include an investment bank, banks specializing in trade financing and a Cuban company that runs a network of foreign exchange houses.</p>
<p>Granma said the new legislation stipulated that foreign banks would only be allowed to open representative offices, as opposed to full branches, in Cuba. Thirteen foreign banks have been granted licenses for representative offices, including banks from Spain, Canada, the Netherlands and Mexico.</p>
