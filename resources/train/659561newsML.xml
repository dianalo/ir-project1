<p>A broad outline of proposals for the Senate Finance Committee's tax bill included a capital gains tax cut to 20 percent from the current maximum of 28 percent for individuals.</p>
<p>The discussion paper, obtained by Reuters, was distributed to senators and makes no mention of a reduction in the capital gains tax for corporations.</p>
<p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, a Delaware Republican, planned to unveil his tax bill next week. The discussion paper was described as the direction the bill was taking but specifics were still being worked out.  </p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee early Friday approved tax legislation that included a similar capital gains tax cut for individuals, but also a corporate capital gains tax rate reduction to 30 percent from the current 35 percent.</p>
<p>Any differences between the House and Senate tax bills must be worked out before the legislation can be enacted.</p>
<p>The draft of the Senate Finance Committee proposal would also not impose a capital gains tax on profits up to $500,000 for couples made on the sale of a home.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance plan included expanding Individual Retirement Accounts, which has been a priority for Roth.  </p>
<p>The discussion draft included a proposed $500 per child tax credit that was given an estimated cost of $83 billion over five years. That would be a higher cost than the $71 billion in the House Ways and Means Committee bill.</p>
<p>The child credit would be allowed for children under age 17 and parents with children aged 13-16 would be required to deposit the credit into an education account.</p>
<p>The proposal would also allow a $250 per child credit for children under age 13 this year.</p>
<p>A new nonrefundable 50 percent tax credit for up to $3,000 of tuition expenses for higher education would be allowed, which appeared similar to a provision in the House tax bill.</p>
<p>A proposal for estate tax relief would phase in a higher threshold where the inheritance tax kicks in to $1 million from the current $600,000.</p>
