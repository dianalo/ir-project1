<p>Dutch-Belgian financial services group Fortis is expected to report a net profit rise of between 13 and 23 percent on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>Fortis, equally-owned by Fortis Amev and Fortis AG, is estimated to report a net profit of between 341 million and 371 million ecus.</p>
<p>First quarter profit jumped 29 percent to 157 million ecus.</p>
<p>Analyst Daan Worm of ING Barings, expecting only a 2.4 percent profit rise in the second quarter, said the quarterly results were likely to follow a peculiar pattern as Fortis includes heavily fluctuating capital gains in its results.</p>
<p>Worm added he estimated that the third quarter would show a 11 percent lower profit compared to the same period in 1995 but final quarter results were expected to surge by 37 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest rise is expected in the fourth quarter,&quot; he said, adding that fourth quarter 1995 results were hit by losses in Belgian and U.S. health insurance.</p>
<p>But analysts said cost reduction schemes had a positive effect on the group's profits.</p>
<p>Harry Luchtenveld of Generale Bank said Dutch-based Fortis Amev was expected to show a profit rise of 15 percent to 390 million guilders in the first-half of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost reduction scheme are counting for about 10 percent of the 15 percent profit rise expected,&quot; Luchtenveld said.</p>
<p>He added that the schemes would have a positive effect on profits in 1997 as well.</p>
<p>The consensus of seven analysts polled by Reuters on the first-half profit of Fortis Amev was set at 386.3 million guilders versus 334.5 million in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Banking is expected to post the biggest rise in the first six months and second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume in the banking sector has increased and the margin is probably higher,&quot; said Ton Mulder of NibStrating.</p>
<p>Mulder said the group was also doing good business in the life insurance sector.</p>
<p>&quot;As the trend in life-insurance is strong all over, it's also good for Fortis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that business in the health sector in the United States was probably still tough.</p>
