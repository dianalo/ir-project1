<p>Bond markets have rarely been so sure about U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve will raise its federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5.50 percent at its Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday, if markets and many economists are right.</p>
<p>The only question, say some, is which way markets will jump?</p>
<p>Reuters asked a dozen fixed income experts to choose where they would invest $100 million if the Fed did in fact raise rates by 25 basis points. Answers were varied but one theme emerged -- after a short-term U.S. rally, Europe looked good.</p>
<p>MICHAEL DERKS, INT'L FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, DMG, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;I would put it in U.S. cash. We are going to have yields going up pretty much everywhere. I would rather wait for the sell-off before I distribute the money. My general idea is to buy the high-yielding markets, like Australia and Italy.</p>
<p>GORDON ROSS, HEAD OF GLOBAL INSTITUTIONAL FIXED INCOME, CHASE</p>
<p>ASSET MANAGEMENT (LONDON), $2.0 BILLION IN FIXED INCOME</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a relief rally across the global markets. The differentials on a spread basis will be very little changed given the U.S. leads all these markets. In the U.S., you should put a lump of the money in the 30-year area. A lot of it will depend on whether Greenspan emphasises the rhetoric that it is pre-emptive. Then the long end of the curve will like it.&quot;</p>
<p>PAUL HORNE, CHIEF INT'L ECONOMIST, SMITH BARNEY, PARIS</p>
<p>&quot;I would go into U.S. 10-years and Bund 10-years. Yields have gone up despite Greenspan's different warnings since December 5 so we're prepared for a tightening and now it starts. Therefore the incipient inflation problem is being delt with.</p>
<p>The worst would be if they didn't do anything and then I would hold my $100 million in cash and wait till May.&quot;</p>
<p>BRIAN VENABLES, SNR ANALYST, ABN AMRO HOARE GOVETT, AMSTERDAM</p>
<p>&quot;I would probably go for the UK. Once the political uncertainty has been removed from the market there will be significant spread tightening to core Europe. I believe the forthcoming interest rate hikes in Britain have been discounted by the markets and I would probably also expect to see some marginal currency gains against both the dollar and the mark.&quot;</p>
<p>ANNE WHITBY, HEAD OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS AT 4CAST, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to be in any bond market on a medium to long term basis. But I do think that all of them look as though they're about to have short-term rallies. I would go for the Bund. It's got a nice little base underneath. This is literally a technical rally.&quot; She forecast gains of one point in a week.</p>
<p>DICK HOWARD, SNR ECONOMIST, JULIUS BAER INVESTMENTS, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar bloc bonds look attractive, and particularly Australia. The Australian spread blew out to 125 basis points over 10-year U.S. Treasuries when the Reserve Bank was perceived to have stopped easing and I think at that level it represents good value. And the currency is reasonably well supported.&quot;</p>
<p>LORENZO CODOGNO, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT BANKAMERICA, MILAN</p>
<p>&quot;The best investment in the very short term would be cash. For second choice I would look at European government bond markets.&quot; Codogno said U.S. markets would disount further rate rises while Europe was unlikely to see any increases this year.</p>
<p>STEVE MAJOR, HEAD OF BOND RESEARCH, CREDIT LYONNAIS, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;The curve is still going to flatten. The most vulnerable part of the curve is the two-year with or without a hike. On a risk reward basis I'd be looking at five-years to get the return with less risk.&quot; He favours Treasuries over Europe in the short-term as a rate rise would make the Fed's strategy clear but saw the T-note/Bund gap widening to 150 b.p. by year end.</p>
<p>COLIN HEART, HEAD OF BOND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AT GARTMORE, NATWEST SUBSIDARY, WITH $12 BILLION IN FIXED INCOME</p>
<p>&quot;We would have 20 percent in the long bond..., 20 percent in Canadian dollar cash, 30 percent in mark short-dated bonds and 30 percent in short-dated yen bonds. If there is going to be a major surprise in terms of interest rates it's not going to be the U.S., it's going to be continental Europe. Similarly, in Japan we think it's going to grow faster than people think.&quot;</p>
<p>DAVID BROWN, CHIEF EUROPEAN ECONOMIST, BEAR STEARNS, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;We still favour an overweight Europe investment stategy over the coming months. The relative fundamentals (notably growth, inflation and interest rate forecasts) are still in hard core Europe's favour.&quot; Brown forecast the 10-year T-note/Bund gap would push out to 150 basis points over three to six months.</p>
<p>SONJA GIBBS, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, NOMURA INT'L, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;On a short-term horizon I would put it in core Europe. It has underperformed the U.S. in the runup to this hike. There's scope after the hike for a bit of a relief trade. The U.S. has done completely the opposite. I suspect when we actually get the hike the market will turn to how many future hikes we will get.&quot;</p>
<p>EUGENIO NAMOR, CAPITAL MARKETS HEAD, SAN PAOLO BANK, LONDON</p>
<p>&quot;I would keep a good 30 percent in dollar cash, then I would invest 20 percent in floating rate Italian bonds. I would put 10 percent in Portuguese bonds, 15 percent in U.S. Treasures and 15 percent in Bunds. I like to have a defensive strategy.&quot; Namor did not think the Fed would raise rates on Tuesday.</p>
