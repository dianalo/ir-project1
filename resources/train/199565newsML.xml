<p>The latest measure by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) aimed at curbing loan expansion may well be ineffective as commercial banks seek ways to blunt its impact, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They added the move could weaken the competitiveness of local banks on the loan market against foreign institutions and exacerbate the interbank money market's already low liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;Until a final solution on restructuring the loan portfolios of large banks, the overall amount of credits will continue to increase and the NBS efforts will not have the desired effect,&quot; Stanislav Krcho, Deputy Manager of bank IRB told Reuters.</p>
<p>In October the NBS set new rules for foreign exchange positions for monetary purposes, effective December 31, aimed at reducing loan expansion.</p>
<p>The new NBS measure requires banks to exclude foreign exchange assets held locally from their foreign exchange position, but include crown liabilities to banks outside Slovakia.</p>
<p>Banks must also reach a minimum ratio of foreign exchange assets and liabilities of 0.65 by December 31, rising gradually to at least 0.8 by June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>If banks fail to meet the required ratio, they will be fined by an increase in their minimum reserves requirements.</p>
<p>Bankers said, however, the measure may become ineffective since banks can ignore the obligation to meet the ratio and calculate their losses from fines into their credit rates.</p>
<p>This will make credits more expensive and hurt local banks's competitiveness on the loan market against foreign banks, said Tatra Banka chief dealer Anna Glasova.</p>
<p>&quot;From this point of view, much would depend on how strictly, or benevolently, the NBS will oversee the fulfilment of the new obligation,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The NBS said commercial banks should have enough room to adjust their activities in order to meet the required ratio.</p>
<p>But, it warned, it still had other tools to ensure the requirements if the banks decide to ignore the measure.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no problem in increasing the fine as a further hike of the minimum reserves requrements should a bank purposely fail to meet the required ratio,&quot; Peter Sevcovic, head of NBS monetary policy department told Reuters.</p>
<p>There are also legal tools to make banks meet the requirements, he added. &quot;The banking law explicitly states which fines can be levied on commercial banks, if these do not adhere to NBS rules,&quot; Sevcovic said.</p>
<p>Analysts also warned that more expensive loans will keep the interbank lending rates at their current high levels and worsen already low liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;We have often warned that the new measure may result in maintaining the improportionately high interbank rates, if not even push them up further,&quot; said Silvia Majlingova, head of liquidity department at CSOB bank.</p>
<p>Interbank money rates currently stand between 14.3-15.2 percent for maturities ranging from overnights to six months.</p>
<p>Some bankers said that while the measure could slow down expansion of hard currency credits, it will have little effect on the volume of crown loans.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem with loan expansion lies in crown credits, especially the classified loans of largest banks,&quot; Krcho said.</p>
<p>The overall volume of credits continued to rise in September by some 1.3 billion crowns ($48.69 million), putting the total volume at 355.4 billion as of September 30 - a 19.2 percent increase year-on-year.</p>
<p>Hard currency credits, which increased by 0.8 billion crowns in September, accounted for 11.3 percent of the overall volume of loans, compared with 11.1 percent at the end of August.</p>
<p>The NBS has stated its year-end target of an increase in total credits at 7.2 percent.</p>
