<p>British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc on Thursday assured legislators that it would not use its lead in digital television receiver technology to restrict access to its rivals to the benefits.</p>
<p>David Chance, the company's deputy managing director, told Parliament's National Heritage Committee: &quot;It is very much our intent to want to encourage use of the system by as many broadcasters as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is the basis of our business -- multi-channel television choice,&quot; Chance added.</p>
<p>Rival broadcasters have expressed alarm that BSkyB could make huge profits out of its technological lead in a technology which could make many more TV channels available to Britons.</p>
<p>But Chance said a recent thorough review by the Office of Fair Trading had shown no past incident of any broadcaster being denied access to its systems.</p>
<p>And he said that government regulations meant that any broadcaster in the future not satisfied with the terms BSkyB demanded for access to its system would be able to appeal to telecommunications regulator OFTEL.</p>
<p>&quot;We have repeatedly stated that we are very happy, in fact we want to encourage, other broadcasters to come onto our system,&quot; Chance said.</p>
