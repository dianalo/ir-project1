<title>INDIA: Security cordon thrown around Kashmir assembly.</title>
<headline>Security cordon thrown around Kashmir assembly.</headline>
<dateline>SRINAGAR, India 1996-10-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The legislature in India's Jammu and Kashmir state convened on Friday for the first time since the eruption of a violent separatist rebellion in 1990.</p>
<p>Police and paramilitary troopers sealed off a large area around the assembly building in the state's summer capital Srinagar, where lawmakers gathered after their election in local polls last month.</p>
<p>A paramilitary trooper and two civilians were injured when suspected separatist guerrillas lobbed a grenade at a security picket, 150 metres (yards) from the assembly building, police said.</p>
<p>Except for police and security petrols, streets around the assembly building were deserted on Friday.</p>
<p>Paramilitary troops could be seen on the roofs of residential buildings next to the assembly building, which overlooks the Jehlum river.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died since the separatist revolt broke out in 1990, police and hospital officials say.</p>
<p>After two aborted attempts in 1995, Indian authorities organised assembly elections last month which were marked by sporadic violence.</p>
<p>&quot;The ballot has already won a remarkable victory. The bullet must now make its exit,&quot; governor K.V. Krishna Rao told the assembly.</p>
<p>The legislative assembly had not met since September 1989. After the separatist insurgency erupted in early 1990, New Delhi imposed direct federal rule over the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The new chief minister, Farooq Abdullah, has an absolute majority in the recently elected 87-member assembly.</p>
<p>He has pledged to win greater autonomy for the state and offered to hold peace talks with separatist leaders, who have rejected the gesture.</p>
