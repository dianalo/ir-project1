<p>Brazil shares fell for a second session in a row, ending 1.49 percent lower Monday despite Wall Street's rebound at the close after two days of steep losses, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index  of the 47 most traded stocks dropped 180 points to close at 11,949 points.</p>
<p>Total market turnover was lighter-than-average at 521.7 million reais ($483.05 million), of which 425.1 million reais comprised the shares that make up the Bovespa index portfolio.  </p>
<p>As the U.S. stock market recovered late in the session, analysts said the bolsa pared losses but did not manage to end higher, weighed down by speculative trades ahead of Wednesday's futures index settlement.</p>
<p>Some traders cited a Central Bank decision earlier to close several small financial institutions as a factor depressing share prices, but others said the impact was minimal because the banks were insignificant.</p>
<p>The Central Bank ordered the liquidation of eight banks and brokerages in connection with a long-running probe into irregular municipal and state debt issues.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the bolsa was likely to keep moving in tandem with U.S. stocks and bonds Tuesday, but subject to volatility ahead of the futures expiration.</p>
<p>Among Brazilian leading stocks, bellwether Telebras preferred ended off 1.80 percent at 147 reais.</p>
<p>State oil firm Petrobras preferred closed up 0.32 percent at 302.99 reais.</p>
<p>Federal power holding Eletrobras preferred lost 3.0 percent, ending at 582 reais.</p>
<p>Private miner CVRD preferred fell 0.36 percent at 27.70 reais.</p>
