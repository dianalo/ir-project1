<p>Public support for Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government has jumped to nearly 60 percent, a survey by Japan's Kyodo News published on Wednesday said.</p>
<p>The approval rating of 59.2 percent, a rise of 14.6 percentage points from the 44.6 percent scored in a previous survey in June, is the highest figure since Hashimoto formed his first cabinet in January, 1996.</p>
<p>Asked why they supported Hashimoto, 23.1 percent of the respondents said they had confidence in Hashimoto, 8.1 percent believed in his leadership, 5.9 percent approved his diplomatic policies, and 44.3 percent said there was no one else appropriate to replace Hashimoto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the disapproval rating fell by 12.2 percentage points to 33.8 percent.</p>
<p>The survey said backing for Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rose by 9.1 percentage points to 45.0 percent.</p>
<p>But support for the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier) Party plunged to 6.8 percent, its lowest since the party's launch in December 1994.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted over the weekend, interviewed 3,000 people of whom 1,936 or 64.5 percent responded.</p>
