<title>NORWAY: Norway debt firms with stronger crown.</title>
<headline>Norway debt firms with stronger crown.</headline>
<text>
<p>1400 GMT -- Norwegian bonds outperformed German Bunds as the crown firmed and Norwegian retail sales figures came out low, players said.</p>
<p>The market saw high activity after several days of thin trade.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of a considerably stronger crown and mild retail sales figures had a positive influence,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;Normally retail sales carry little weight, but today it seems the figures had an unusually big effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Retail sales excluding vehicles and petrol were 0.7 percent lower in March year on year.</p>
<p>At 1400 GMT, the crown had firmed to 4.1140 against the mark from 4.1480 at the same time on Tuesday. The crown was quoted at 100.77 against the inverse ECU index, a European basket of currencies, a bit stronger than the 101.60 reading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>1400 GMT vs 1400 GMT on Tuesday</p>
<p>* 2007 bond yield eight points lower at 6.12 pct</p>
<p>* Norway over Bunds gap five points narrower at 28 points</p>
<p>* Three-month eurokrone four points lower at 3.48 pct</p>
