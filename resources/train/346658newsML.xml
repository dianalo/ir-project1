<headline>Ecuador radio association bans president's program.</headline>
<dateline>QUITO, Ecuador 1997-01-31</dateline>

<p>Ecuador's Radio Broadcasting Association called a radio programme hosted by President Abdala Bucaram slanderous and said it would not broadcast it again, a local newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The national radio and television networks exist to inform the country and not to propagate slander,&quot; said association President Louis Hanna, quoted by El Universo.</p>
<p>Bucaram began to broadcast &quot;Fireside Chat&quot; last Friday and spent much of his hour on the air attacking political opponents, whom he accused of conspiring against his six-month old government.</p>
<p>Hanna said the association had decided on Wednesday to ban the programme.</p>
<p>&quot;In the interests of public order, the association will only record programmes which inform the country according to legal norms, because as radio broadcasters we cannot be party to slander,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government said that the next &quot;Fireside Chat&quot; had already been recorded and would be broadcast as planned.</p>
