<p>Teamsters Union President Ron Carey declared victory Saturday over rival James Hoffa in their hard-fought election to lead the 1.4 million member union, even though all votes had not been counted.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me say it as it is,&quot; Carey told a news conference. &quot;We beat the mob. We beat corporate America. We beat the old guard officials in our union.&quot;  </p>
<p>A court-appointed election officer, who has overseen the counting of a half-million mail-in ballots since Tuesday, has not yet declared a winner in the race. The officer reported Friday that Carey had 52 percent of the vote, with some 62 percent of the ballots counted.</p>
<p>The Carey campaign, however, said its more up-to-date tallies Saturday showed Carey maintaining a solid lead over Hoffa with more than 80 percent of the vote tabulated.</p>
<p>Carey, 60, who won the Teamster presidency as a reform candidate in the union's first open election five years ago, has fought a bruising battle against Hoffa, 55, whom he has accused of being backed by the mob and Teamster employers. Hoffa's father Jimmy Hoffa, who ruled the union in the 1950s and 1960s before he went to prison in 1967, is presumed to have been murdered by the mob in 1975.</p>
