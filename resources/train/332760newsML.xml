<p>A blistering rally by market favourite Reliance Industries on speculative bidding and buying support from foreign funds led Bombay's benchmark index to end in positive territory on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>At the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the bell-wether Reliance stock closed 9.0 rupees higher, or 3.63 percent, at 256.75, in volumes of over 7.9 million shares. The share's high was 259.75 rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;Reliance was the only major mover...some speculative buying coupled with institutional buying was seen..,&quot; said Ketan Jhaveri, chief dealer at institutional brokerage Kotak Securities.</p>
<p>The share jumped 12.50 rupees or over five percent to 259.0 at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) with more than 1.85 billion shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Traders said a few foreign funds have bought large quantities of Reliance stock in the last few sessions.</p>
<p>Trading activity in the broader market remained lacklustre with share prices moving in a narrow band, they said.</p>
<p>The top 30-share index BSE index hit an early high of 3,448.76 but ended 12.04 points, or 0.35 percent, higher, at a provisional close of 3,439.19.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were waiting for the government to followthrough on hints and promises by announcing measures to restore confidence in the capital markets before committing funds.</p>
<p>&quot;People are adopting a wait-and-see policy. Buying interest is still there at lower levels,&quot; said Kotak's Jhaveri.</p>
<p>Among pivotal stocks, BHEL was up 8.75 to 230.0 rupees, Bajaj Auto 16.70 to 918.0, L&amp;T 1.50 to 236.0 and Gujarat Ambuja Cement 7.75 to 237.50.</p>
<p>SBI however, lost 5.75 to 271.25, ITC 15.50 to 385.0, TISCO 1.0 to 189.25, ACC 15.20 to 1,332.50 and M&amp;M 3.25 to 345.0.</p>
<p>The 50-stock NSE index ended with a marginal loss of 0.45 points to a provisional 985.80 in rangebound trade.</p>
