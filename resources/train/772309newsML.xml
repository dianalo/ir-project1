<p>Search crews combing through  the rubble of Australia's ski-village landslide on Friday unearthed  three bodies, bringing the confirmed death toll to four.</p>
<p>Twenty people are thought to have been entombed in Wednesday night's  landslide in the ski village of Thredbo, in Australia's Snowy Mountains,  when a slope gave way, destroying two lodges.</p>
<p>As hopes turned to despair of ever finding someone alive in the mangled  wreckage of the two lodges, search crews working under lights in freezing  conditions on Friday night spotted two more bodies amongst the tonnes  of debris.</p>
<p>The late-night discovery followed the sighting of a second victim  earlier in the day. The first, a man, was recovered from the mess  of concrete, twisted metal, trees and dirt on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Another two bodies have been located underneath a concrete slab,&quot;  police spokeswoman Sue Netterfield told Reuters.</p>
<p>A massive weight of concrete slabs, stacked in a precarious heap where  many of the missing are believed trapped, is being painstakingly sawn  into pieces before being hoisted free.</p>
<p>&quot;Those two bodies are still there and they have not been moved yet.  It brings the total number of deaths to four,&quot; Netterfield said.</p>
<p>Frustration has begun to show on the faces of search crews whose efforts  have been stalled by the instability of the slope and fears that the  mass of debris could slide further.</p>
<p>Family and friends of the victims have kept a grim vigil on the search,  watching from a facing hillside for signs of life.</p>
<p>But as the night fell and the temperature plunged well below freezing  for the third night since the landslide, police on Friday virtually  ruled out the chance of finding a survivor.</p>
<p>Police said this likelihood was &quot;infinitesimally small&quot;.</p>
<p>Optic fibre cameras and thermal imaging equipment have failed to show  signs of life in the wreckage of the Carinya and Bimbadeen lodges.</p>
<p>The work of picking through the rubble has been fraught with danger  and hazards such as leaking fuel from crushed cars. The rubble is  10 metres (35 feet) deep in places.</p>
<p>&quot;I am quite confident they (family and friends) understand the enormity  of the task that faces us,&quot; Superintendent Charlie Sanderson told  reporters on Friday night.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, distraught Thredbo villagers touched by the landslide  gathered at their small, sunlit church to pray for survivors and mourn  those confirmed dead.</p>
<p>Messages of sympathy poured in from around the world to the small,  close-knit community which swells to 4,000 in the skiing season from  a summer population of about 500.</p>
<p>Britain's Queen Elizabeth, who is also Australia's head of state,  sent a message of sympathy to the victims' friends and families, Deputy  Prime Minister Tim Fischer cut short an official visit to Japan, and  Prime Minister John Howard issued a special statement of sympathy  from his hospital bed.</p>
<p>Church services were held around the country.</p>
<p>Police have said those buried included a middle-aged couple from California,  a New Zealand woman and 17 Australians.</p>
<p>Experts believe seepage from a mountain spring may have caused the  earth to give way.</p>
