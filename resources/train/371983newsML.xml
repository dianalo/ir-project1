<p>The National Bank of Poland found irregularities in the way  Bank Powierniczo-Gwarancyjny SA (BPG) conducted obligatory procedures to prevent money-laundering, the central bank said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There were irregularities...in the realisation of rules on bank behaviour in circumstances indicating that money being deposited in the bank may have come from or was connected with criminal activity, and the paying in of cash above a certain amount,&quot; a central bank statement, issued to reporters, said.</p>
<p>The NBP also said it was investigating BPG's complicated ownership structure, in which main shareholders held less than 10 percent each but were also part-owners of companies holding BPG equity, to establish whether any of the shareholders in fact had larger stakes through cross holdings.</p>
<p>&quot;The legal owners of the stock have been identified and we are still trying to establish the true owners of firms which have BPG shares, their credibility, as well as the sources of cash for which the shares were bought,&quot; the NBP said.</p>
<p>The NBP said it had informed &quot;relevant state authorities&quot; of its findings and that no further details would be revealed to reporters. No financial data on BPG was immediately available.</p>
