<p>Jordan's King Hussein defended himself on Thursday against accusations by Israeli ministers that his warnings of violence had somehow led to the killings of seven schoolgirls by a Jordanian soldier.</p>
<p>Hussein had warned in a letter published on Wednesday there was a &quot;very strong chance of violence&quot; if Israel pushed ahead with plans for a Jewish settlement on the outskirts of Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;It was fully in my responsibility to warn that we have come too far,&quot; Hussein told journalists in Spain, referring to his letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which has been criticised by Israeli officials.</p>
<p>Israel's Education Minister Zevulun Hammer suggested the Jordan king should not have spoken out about possible violence, telling army radio: &quot;Perhaps the conclusion is that the king must hold his tongue so that a soldier doesn't take his words to mean more than he intended.&quot;</p>
<p>Hussein, who cut short a visit to Spain because of the killings, said he had never thought his words would be taken that way.</p>
<p>He added that he felt the peace he had worked for his whole life was facing a difficult moment.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also made a reference to &quot;gun-toting lunatics&quot; waiting for an excuse, but he said he was not referring to Hussein's statement.</p>
