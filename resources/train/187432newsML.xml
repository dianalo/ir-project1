<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures settled firmer across the board on Wednesday, buoyed by firmer bullion prices, while platinum futures eased on profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from four to six yen per gram higher. Most-active benchmark October was five yen higher at 1,358 yen.</p>
<p>Platinum futures ranged from flat to six yen per gram lower. Benchmark October was three yen lower at 1,379 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Buying in gold futures by private investors emerged at the opening, reflecting the yen's weaker tone, but activity became quiet as the buying ebbed later,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Price gains in gold futures were capped by profit-taking amid views the dollar's upside will be limited and expectations that spot gold will be tough to break above its upside resistance at $383.50 in the near term.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $382.40/70 per ounce at the Tokyo close, against $382.20/70 in New York on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Spot gold lacked clear direction and was sandwiched between moderate buying by Japanese trade houses and profit-taking selling, the traders said.  </p>
<p>Platinum futures opened firmer, encouraged by the fact that spot platinum rebounded above $387 per ounce, but platinum futures later succumbed to technical-driven profit-taking.</p>
<p>The gold-platinum spread showed signs of widening as a result of recent rises in platinum futures.</p>
<p>Silver futures ranged from 1.2 yen per 10 grams lower to 1.3 yen firmer. Benchmark October was flat at 178.5 yen.</p>
<p>After sluggish trade, palladium futures ranged from one yen to five yen per gram higher. Benchmark October was up two yen at 424 yen. -- Tokyo Commodity Desk +81-3-3432-7431</p>
