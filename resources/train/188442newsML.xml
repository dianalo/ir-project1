<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) three months delivery copper sagged again in late inter-office activity but just clung to support around $2,020 per tonne.</p>
<p>Copper prices fell late Thursday afternoon and a lower kerb close had reflected nervousness over stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>Last kerb trade was down $28 from Wednesday at $2,032 per tonne after the support around $2,020 was maintained during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Copper was again pressured to the downside in post-kerb activity and was bid as low as $2,012. But it was just firmer from the lows again and assessed at $2,018/2,020 at 1900 GMT when Comex closed.</p>
<p>LME stocks on Friday are mostly forecast falling by between 4,000 and 15,000 tonnes. A decrease of just 10,000 would take the total under 100,000 for the first time since July 1990.</p>
<p>Traders reported some talk that stocks could show a rise on Friday which caused some of the liquidation, although the overall consensus is still for declines to be maintained.</p>
