<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed in a phone call to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to clinch a deal on a long-promised handover of the West Bank town of Hebron, a Palestinian negotiator said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu called Arafat last night and he reiterated his commitment to implementing the deals, but as far as we are concerned this is only a verbal commitment,&quot; Palestinian peace negotiator Hassan Asfour said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not translated in the talks and they do not give it to us on paper,&quot; Asfour told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli concern for the security of Jews in the West Bank city has held up its transfer to Palestinian self-rule. Some 400 Jews live there among 100,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office confirmed the call, saying the Israeli leader told Arafat the security arrangements demanded by Israel were vital to an accord.</p>
<p>Under a deal signed in 1995, Israeli troops will redeploy and Palestinian police will move in.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials had hoped to clinch a deal on the long-delayed pullback during a three-day Middle East economic conference starting on Tuesday in Cairo.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said Netanyahu had hoped for a deal before he leaves on Wednesday for a planned week-long visit to the United States.</p>
<p>But Arafat, asked about Israeli media reports that a deal might be two days away, told reporters in Gaza: &quot;As usual they are putting only appointments and appointments but nothing has been achieved till now.&quot;</p>
<p>He then flew to Cairo where he was to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he would not be attending the conference but a senior Israeli official said Foreign Minister David Levy would attend.</p>
<p>Netanyahu told Arafat in the phone call that after a Hebron accord, the sides could discuss other issues including an easing of a closure restricting the number of Palestinians allowed to work in Israel, Israeli spokesman Shai Bazak said.</p>
<p>&quot;Arafat told the prime minister he understands the points the prime minister raised,&quot; Bazak said in a statement.</p>
<p>But PLO officials said Arafat did not agree to the points raised by Netanyahu and told him that Palestinian proposals on security arrangements in Hebron were sufficient.</p>
<p>They said the Palestinian leadership doubted Netanyahu intended to close a deal soon because he refused to commit himself on paper to implementing accords signed by Israel's previous government, like the Hebron deal.</p>
<p>Chief peace negotiators Saeb Erekat of the Palestinians and Dan Shomron of Israel met on Sunday night.</p>
