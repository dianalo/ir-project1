<title>BELGIUM: Belgium adjusts central bank statutes for EMU.</title>
<headline>Belgium adjusts central bank statutes for EMU.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-07-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Belgian parliament approved on Thursday a law granting greater independence to the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) as a majority dismissed opposition charges that the law did nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>The law is designed to bring central bank statutes into line with the requirements on independence set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>It paves the way for the bank to carry out tasks set by the planned European System of Central Banks and to help achieve the ESCB's goals, namely price stability and the general economic policies laid down by the European Union.</p>
<p>It states the bank cannot take instructions from the government on any part of its ESCB-related activities and can question Treasury bond issues that might disrupt ECB monetary policy.</p>
<p>However, the government will retain a seat on the bank's supervisory Regents Council, which at present meets once a week to set monetary policy, and will have the right to veto any operation not related to ESCB activities.</p>
<p>The law was approved by 78 votes in favour, 33 against and 29 abstentions.</p>
<p>Some members of parliament, from both the government and opposition benches, voted against parts of the law allowing the government to expand the size of the bank's board to seven from six directors, plus the central bank governor.</p>
<p>Critics said the clause was designed to allow the Christian Democrat (CVP) party of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to keep two seats on the board once the present governor and CVP representative Alfons Verplaetse steps down, probably in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;This could have been a good project. However, it has been ruined by an article which allows the governor and the prime minister to nominate their friends (to the board)...at the same time the bank is holding a works council meeting to say how many staff will have to leave because of EMU,&quot; Paul De Grauwe of the opposition VLD said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a member of the (governing) majority, but I think this decision is totally in contradiction with the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty, which I signed,&quot; former Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens told Reuters on Tuesday, when the government amendment was adopted in committee.</p>
<p>As well as bringing the statutes into line with the Maastricht Treaty, the law will raise the amount of central bank gold that can be sold in the form of commemorative coins by approximately 133 tonnes.</p>
<p>The law says gold coin sales would be limited to a maximum 26 tonnes a year and have to be approved first by the European Central Bank. The proceeds, less a share belonging to Luxembourg, could also only be used to repay Belgium's foreign currency debt.</p>
