<p>Pakistan's Supreme Court said on Wednesday it had upheld President Farooq Leghari's dismissal of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, a decision meaning fresh elections will go ahead as planned on February 3.</p>
<p>&quot;We uphold the order of the president and dismiss the petition&quot; Bhutto brought against her ouster, Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah said in court.</p>
<p>&quot;There is enough material to establish corruption, nepotism and misrule,&quot; Shah said at the end of a hearing which began on January 13.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the verdict was followed swiftly by clashes between police and Bhutto supporters outside the court.</p>
<p>They said police baton-charged stone-throwing demonstrators who were chanting pro-Bhutto slogans. There was no immediate word on injuries or arrests.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's keenly-awaited judgement, by a 6-1 majority of the seven-judge bench, also meant those who bought on the stock market in anticipation of just such a decision had won their bets.</p>
<p>The stock market index in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial capital, rose 11.11 points, or 0.74 percent, on Wednesday and traders said speculators had moved it on hopes of the verdict going against Bhutto.</p>
<p>Bhutto was expected to hold a news conference at her Karachi home later in the day.</p>
<p>Leghari dismissed Bhutto's government on November 5, accusing it of corruption and misrule, charges Bhutto denies.</p>
<p>Fresh elections are set for February 3 and opinion polls show Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) trailing her main rival, the Pakistan Moslem League (PML) of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>
<p>The latest poll, by Gallup Pakistan and published in The News English-language daily, said 40 percent of its 2,000 respondents polled across the country planned to vote for the PML against just 20 percent for the PPP.</p>
