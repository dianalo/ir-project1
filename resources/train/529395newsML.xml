<p>Barry's Jewelers Inc said on Tuesday it was reviewing restructuring plans that the company's former management began earlier this year, which could change the composition of previously announced charges related to these initiatives.</p>
<p>In January, Barry's said it would implement company-wide restructuring moves requiring one-time charges to third quarter operations of between $10 million and $14 million.</p>
<p>Barry's new management said they had not yet determined if all of the initiatives would be adopted or if some initiatives would be added due to new operating strategies being developed.</p>
<p>As a result, the composition of the charges would change and the charges would occur in both the third and fourth quarters as the initiatives were finalised, it said.</p>
<p>The company said that while management did not expect the size of the charges to significantly increase, it could not make an estimate until the re-evalution was completed.  </p>
<p>In the third quarter, Barry's reported an earnings loss of $1.70 per share, including various charges, compared to a profit of $0.79 per share a year earlier. During the quarter, $1.3 million was charged to restructuring expense.</p>
<p>The company also said it changed its customer receivable write-off policy.</p>
<p>Before, Barry's would fully reserve for accounts that fell within certain parameters but would continue internal collection efforts until it was determined the accounts should be written off.</p>
<p>Now, internal collection efforts for fully reserved accounts will be discontinued and the accounts will be sent to outside collection agencies, Barry's said.</p>
<p>As a result, the company said it accelerated the write-off of about $6.8 million of customer receivables against the allowance for doubtful accounts.</p>
<p>Such a charge was fully reserved for and had no material impact on current operations, it said.</p>
