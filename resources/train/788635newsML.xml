<p>World oil supplies have risen far more slowly than expected so far this year, helping underpin oil prices in a market led by a robust demand growth among the world's industrialised powers, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Oil markets were much tighter than expected in June and July as the absence of Iraqi exports was compounded by supply shortfalls from several areas and strong demand for gasoline,&quot; the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly Oil Market Report.</p>
<p>The agency made hefty downward revisions of between 400,000 barrels a day (bpd) and 600,000 bpd for its quarterly estimates of non-OPEC supply, which exclude Iraq, for the entire period Q297-Q498.</p>
<p>In particular it revised down its projections for the third and fourth quarters of 1997 by 600,000 bpd apiece from last month's report to 44.5 million bpd and 46.1 million.</p>
<p>Non-OPEC supply on average for 1997 is now projected by the IEA at 44.8 million bpd rising to 46.8 million bpd for 1998.</p>
<p>The IEA said its reduced projections for non-OPEC supply reflected &quot;the recent underperformance in the North Sea and Australia,&quot; and downward revisions to data for some developing countries.</p>
<p>Estimates for strong growth in world demand this year were left unchanged at 1.9 million bpd, or 2.6 percent, over 1996 to an average 73.8 million bpd.</p>
<p>The agency said global oil demand for the second quarter was estimated up 2.7 million bpd or 3.9 percent, on the same period last year to 72.6 million.</p>
<p>Demand for OPEC crude for the remainder of this year and next is now pegged by the IEA much higher than previous expectations.</p>
<p>It now puts its call on OPEC at 25.5 million bpd for the third quarter, up 800,000 bpd from last month's report, and at 26.9 million bpd for the fourth quarter, a 600,000 upward revision.</p>
<p>The average call on OPEC for next year is projected at 25.9 million bpd, up 600,000 bpd from last month's report.</p>
<p>The IEA said that as a result of tighter market fundamentals industry stocks among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries advanced by less in the second quarter than in the 1991 aftermath of the Gulf War.</p>
<p>It said world oil supplies in July recovered to 73.6 million bpd from a June's 7.3 million, revised down from 73.69 million in last month's report.</p>
