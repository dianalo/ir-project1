<p>Shares in British Telecommunications were marked higher in pre-market dealings on Thursday after the company said pretax profits fell slightly in the second quarter. BT shares, which started the year at around 354p, were marked four pence higher at 360-1/2p by 0805 GMT. The stock led volumes, with just over million shares traded.</p>
<p>&quot;The earnings were pretty much in line with expectations but the dividend was slightly better...all in all, it was a good statement. We see the share moving higher on this,&quot; one marketmaker said, echoing others.  </p>
<p>BT raised its dividend to 7.9p in the second quarter from 7.45p a year earlier. Pretax profit fell to 730 million stg in the second quarter from 732 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>An analyst, who asked not to be named, called the second quarter profits &quot;very good&quot; when weighed against consensus forecasts of around 685 million stg.</p>
<p>He suggested an item on the cost side had helped earnings but noted that the growth in turnover to 3.725 billion from 3.549 billion was stronger than expected.</p>
<p>However, he said the redundancy charge at 235 million stg was larger than forecast.  </p>
<p>James Golob, telecoms analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the figures had outstripped most expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;The key is that domestic core volume growth was better than expected although mobile revenue growth in the second quarter is a bit disappointing and down sequentially on the first quarter, if up year-on-year,&quot; Golob said.</p>
<p>Golob said redundancy charges were lower than expected.</p>
<p>He said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell was neutral on the stock and that the figures were unlikely to change recommendations.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were waiting for a company meeting on Thursday to assess the results further.  </p>
<p>They said they would be looking particularly at comments on BT's expectations for its planned merger with MCI Communications and the impact of recent price-cutting campaigns.</p>
