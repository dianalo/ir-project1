<p>The United States on Wednesday accused the U.N. Human Rights Commission of failing the people of China by not voting on a resolution criticising Beijing's rights record.</p>
<p>The State Department panned European and other countries that refused to support the resolution and said China had scored only a &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot; by getting the commission to adopt a no-action motion on the resolution.</p>
<p>At Tuesday's commission meeting in Geneva, a majority of 27 countries supported China's motion with 17 opposing and nine abstaining, sinking the resolution which had been proposed by Denmark and backed by the United States.</p>
<p>It was the seventh year since 1990 that a vote had been prevented on the issue in the 53-member body.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret very much that other democratic countries -- especially many in Europe -- chose not to stand up yesterday,&quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.</p>
<p>He mentioned no names, but France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Greece, as well as Japan, Canada and Australia all refrained from from officially co-sponsoring the resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;The real losers in the vote were China's 1.2 billion people,&quot; Burns told a news briefing. &quot;The organisation created to discuss their problems living in an authoritarian society, that organisation failed China's people yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect this might be a Pyrrhic victory&quot; for China, Burns added. &quot;All of the controversy surrounding this vote only serves to cast international attention on China's human rights record, which is very poor.&quot;</p>
<p>The regular exemption of China from discussion in Geneva &quot;threatens to undermine the commission at a time when multilateral discussions of human rights ought to be growing, not limited in the international community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. spokesman heaped praise on Denmark for proposing the resolution, a move which has been sharply attacked by Beijing and brought hints of possible commercial retaliation.</p>
<p>&quot;Denmark has been true to a very important international principle. And that is, the universality of human rights all over the world,&quot; Burns said.</p>
