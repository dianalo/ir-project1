<headline>USDA May 12 world grain highlights.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department Monday lowered its estimate for the 1996/97 Argentina soybean crop to 12.40 million tonnes due to dry weather, and decreased its forecast for Brazil soybean production to 26.50 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In its May world supply/demand report, USDA also sharply increased its export estimate for Brazil soybeans to 6.50 million tonnes, reflecting increased shipments to Europe and Asia.  </p>
<p>USDA also significantly lowered its Argentine soybean export forecast to 950,000 tonnes, down from 1.90 million tonnes estimated last month.</p>
<p>USDA increased its estimate for China soybean production to 13.50 million tonnes and a senior USDA analyst said Chinese soybean production next year is likely to be even bigger due to increased plantings.</p>
<p>China corn exports in 1996/97 were left unchanged at 2.50 million tonnes, and were lowered to 2.00 million in 1997/98 due to a lower corn production estimate of 122 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>Wheat production in all major exporting countries was estimated to be down in 1997/98, but with the large carryin stocks from 1996/97, exports were expected to stay strong.</p>
<p>Australia wheat exports in 1996/97 were raised for the fifth month in a row to 19.00 million tonnes, but were lowered to 14.00 million tonnes for 1997/98. Canada wheat exports in 1996/97 were left unchanged at 18 million tonnes but were raised to 19.00 million tonnes in 1997/98.</p>
<p>World grain crops were projected to total 1,854.61 million tonnes in 1997/98, slightly below the 1996/97 level of 1,858.55 million tonnes.  </p>
<p>1997/98 world wheat production was pegged at 578.44 million tonnes, oilseeds at 273.00 million tonnes, coarse grains at 898.87 million, rice at 377.31 million, and cotton at 87.50 million bales.</p>
