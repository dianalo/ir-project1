<p>Local markets were the source of a real 1.9 percent growth in New Zealand manufacturers' sales in the June 1996 quarter over the same period last year, the Manufacturers Federation said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It said the &quot;unexpected&quot; result in sales growth was highlighted in the latest Trust Bank quarterly analysis of manufacturing prepared by economic forecaster BERL for ManFed.</p>
<p>&quot;The sales increase locally offset a slight downturn overall in export sales during the quarter,&quot; ManFed said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The Trust Bank analysis had noted that manufacturers' pre tax profit-to-sales ratios were being sustained at 9.5 percent despite high interest and exchange rates squeezing margins.</p>
<p>&quot;We attribute the increase in sales to the fact that many more people are now employed for at least a large part of the time,&quot; ManFed said.</p>
<p>This had resulted, for example, in overall household incomes being up about nine percent (to the year ended March) well prior to the effect of the tax cuts.  </p>
<p>&quot;It appears manufacturers have also been achieving a part of their increased sales out of stocks of finished goods,&quot; ManFed said.</p>
<p>&quot;Stock levels have subsequently been trimmed back still further than they were -- we were expecting stock cuts to continue until the September quarter, but this result indicates the levels of stocks cannot be pared back any more.&quot;</p>
<p>ManFed said it believed orders between manufacturers for imports and components were now likely to pick up.  </p>
<p>&quot;The expenditure is lower this quarter, but at an annualised rate is 4.6 percent higher than the previous year, and exporting is still difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, we are confident the important Australian market will soon become more positive, and that monetary conditions in New Zealand will begin to ease, allowing better margins as the exchange rate favourably adjusts in real terms.&quot;</p>
<p>ManFed said the most positive indicator was the ongoing increase in manufacturing productivity that were being achieved, and the underlying confident, though cautious, signals that were evident.  </p>
