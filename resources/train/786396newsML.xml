<p>New Zealand wine exports grew 26 percent in value to NZ$75.9 million for the year to 30 June, 1997, the Wine Institute of New Zealand said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The volume of exports was up 19 percent to 13.1 million litres.</p>
<p>In 1995/96 wine exports totalled 11 million litres worth $60.3 million. The value of exports has risen from $18 million in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth is the result of the industry's investment in long term market development, and the increased availability of wine from the 1995 and 1996 vintages,&quot; institute chief executive Philip Gregan said.</p>
<p>Britain remains the major market for New Zealand wine, taking 8.1 million litres of wine valued at $47.1 million in 1996/97. This compares with 7.4 million litres and $40.6 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>However, the fastest growth occurred in markets such as the United States, Germany and Australia. Exports to the United States rose 170 percent in 1996/97 to 508,000 litres, and to Australia the increase was 41 percent to 1.6 million litres.</p>
<p>Bottled wine exports to Germany also increased rapidly, jumping more than 200 percent over the previous year.</p>
<p>Gregan said the 10 percent fall of the New Zealand dollar against the U.S. dollar since November should give the industry a further fillip.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall hasn't impacted much this year. The fall in the dollar should boost returns over the next year if it keeps down,&quot; Gregan said.</p>
<p>Exports had been concentrated in Britain because of a shortage of available wine.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been far more successful in the U.K. market than we ever imagined we would be and we haven't had the supply to develop other markets,&quot; Gregan said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been no use developing other markets up until now because we haven't had the grapes to supply.&quot;</p>
<p>Exports are projected to rise 20 percent per annum as wine planting increases to 83,000 hectares in two years from 73,000 in 1997.</p>
<p>The institute expects annual exports to be more than $125 million by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>New Zealand expects to further develop its markets in the United States, Australia, Germany and The Netherlands.</p>
