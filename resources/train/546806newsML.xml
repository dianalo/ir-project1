<p>Thailand and the Philippines said on Tuesday they had signed a bilateral trade agreement and set a goal of $2.4 billion in two-way trade by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers of the two countries made the statements at the end of a bilateral meeting on southern Phuket island.</p>
<p>&quot;It behooves us to work together not only for bilateral interests but as our contribution towards regional peace and prosperity,&quot; Thai foreign minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn said after the meeting.</p>
<p>He said the governments aimed to have $2.4 billion in bilateral trade by 2000. In January leaders of the two countries said they wanted to expand trade, then about $1.2 billion a year, to more than $2.0 billion by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Prachuab said the two countries were formulating a plan for joint investment promotion that should expand to encompass cooperation in third countries.</p>
<p>Thailand and the Philippines also agreed to further intensify existing technical cooperation programs in agricultural, scientific and technical fields.</p>
<p>Philippine foreign secretary Domingo Siazon said his country submitted a draft avoidance of double taxation agreement during the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;The early conclusion of the negotiations on this draft agreement will benefit our airline industries and will have enormous positive impact on our trade and tourism,&quot; he said.</p>
