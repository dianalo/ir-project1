<p>President Yahya Jammeh, marking the third anniversary of the coup that brought him to power, urged Gambia's people on Tuesday to be self-reliant and united and said party politics should play a back-seat role.</p>
<p>Jammeh, who won civilian rule elections in September 1996, said he would not allow the opposition to destabilise the West African country in the guise of democracy.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally of an estimated 40,000 people, he urged the nation's citizens to seek &quot;national reconciliation and reconstruction, unity, hard work and self-reliance&quot;. Party politics, he said, should be relegated in pursuit of the dream of a new Gambia.</p>
<p>&quot;Although overall growth has been modest, inflation has been put under control at below three percent, the balance of payments situation is positive and our foreign exchange reserves can assure us of at least five months of imports,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Attackers shot dead one soldier and wounded three others on Monday. The defence ministry blamed former soldiers who took part in a failed counter-coup attempt in 1994.</p>
<p>Jammeh came to power that year when he and other junior army officers toppled the elected government of founding president Sir Dawda Jawara, now exiled in Britain.</p>
<p>His Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction won a commanding majority in a December parliamentary poll. Relations with the opposition are strained.</p>
<p>His coup alienated Western donors, a blow for a country heavily dependent on foreign aid. He has since built up ties with Libya and other Arab nations, Taiwan and Cuba. He said on Tuesday Gambia's relations with the West had improved.</p>
