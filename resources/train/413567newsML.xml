<p>Vandals smashed three gravestones in a Jewish cemetery in the West Bank city of Hebron, a settler leader said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Three headstones were smashed. We're going to post guards here from now on,&quot; Noam Arnon, who heads the tiny Jewish community, told Reuters. He blamed Palestinians and said settlers would meet to &quot;decide on a response&quot;.</p>
<p>The headstones carried names of Jews who lived in Hebron 150 years ago, Arnon said. Witnesses said about 15 settlers and dozens of Israeli police had gathered at the cemetery.</p>
<p>Palestinians said &quot;Death to the Jews&quot; was painted in Arabic on a wall near the cemetery, signed by the Islamic militant group Hamas that opposes the Israel-PLO peace agreements.</p>
<p>Israeli troops withdrew from 80 percent of Hebron in January under a peace deal with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. The cemetery is in the 20 percent still occupied by Israeli soldiers, which is also home to more than 15,000 Palestinians.</p>
