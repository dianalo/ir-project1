<headline>ISRAEL CPI-LINKED BONDS HIGHER BUT SELLERS APPEAR.</headline>

<p>Israeli CPI-linked bonds closed higher on Thursday while prices of unlinked bonds fell on expectations of a high July consumer price index (CPI), traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.05 pct to 111.55</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.13 pct to 112.01</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: -0.17 pct to 109.92</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.1 pct to 111.33</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: -0.02 pct to 108.49</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was a high 270 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of unlinked bonds fell considerably because of expectations of a high July CPI of around 1.0-1.1 percent,&quot; said Roy Meir of Simodan.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders are afraid interest rates will go up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meir said prices of CPI-linked bonds continued to rise on Thursday on the high CPI expectations and on the tight supply of these bonds expected in August.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields of CPI-linked long bonds have fallen to around 3.7 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of CPI-linked bonds continued higher today but for the first time in a while there were also sellers of CPI-linked bonds and buyers of unlinked bonds, which explains the high volume,&quot; said Tiki Haddad of IBI Investment House.</p>
<p>Haddad said that because yields of CPI-linked bonds had fallen significantly in the past few weeks, these bonds had become unattractive and traders had started buying unlinked bonds whose yields have been on the rise.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an enormous amount of sellers of CPI-linked instruments in off-the-floor trading,&quot; Haddad said.</p>
<p>Government bond redemptions are expected to total about four billion shekels in August against issues of 1.6 billion shekels; a successful privatisation process and higher tax revenues are all expected to lessen the government's need to raise debt on the bond market.</p>
<p>Traders said that the shortage was expected to affect all government bonds, but especially CPI-linked bonds.</p>
<p>The Treasury said on Wednesday it would issue 1.6 billion shekels worth of bonds in August. Of these issues, 900 million shekels would be in CPI-linked bonds and 700 million shekels in unlinked bonds. The Treasury said it would not issue any dollar-linked bonds in August.</p>
<p>The rise of the dollar against the shekel in June, which caused June's CPI to rise a steep 1.1 percent, has triggered fears of a series of high indices in July and August.</p>
<p>July's CPI will be published on August 15.</p>
<p>Prices of dollar-linked bonds closed stable, traders said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
