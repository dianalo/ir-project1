<p>Hong Kong democracy movement leader Martin Lee said after a White House visit on Friday he had no doubt the United States would &quot;defend Hong Kong's freedoms&quot; after it reverts to Chinese control.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt at all after this meeting and of course last week's meeting with Secretary of State (Madeleine) Albright that the U.S. government will defend Hong Kong's freedoms,&quot; Lee said when reporters asked if his meeting with President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had reassured him on this point.  </p>
<p>Lee, who has been touring U.S. and Canadian cities since March 19, said he had &quot;a very good meeting&quot; with Clinton and Gore as he sought to outline concerns for civil liberties in the British colony after it returns to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt in my mind that the U.S. government will continue to take Hong Kong very seriously and will raise (the issue of) Hong Kong at all high level meetings with the Chinese leaders,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>The White House meeting was arranged so that Clinton &quot;dropped in&quot; on a scheduled meeting between Lee and Gore. Lee said Clinton was present for about 25 minutes and added, &quot;I urged him to renew Most-Favoured-Nation (trade status) for China unconditionally this year because my party's position has always been that if MFN is not renewed for China, then Hong Kong will be hurt first.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Clinton made clear he would push for MFN renewal.</p>
