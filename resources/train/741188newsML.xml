<p>Andrew Cunanan, the prime suspect in the murder of designer Gianni Versace, feared he might have contracted the AIDS virus and told a counsellor he would &quot;get&quot; the person who may have transmitted it to him, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Two months before he set out on an alleged cross-country murder spree, Cunanan approached Mike Dudley, a volunteer counsellor at an agency for people with AIDS and HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease.</p>
<p>&quot;He started asking me pretty basic questions about HIV transmission,&quot; Dudley told the newspaper. &quot;He was mentioning some of the things he had done sexually. I explained the things were sort of in the gray area and (that) he should take greater precautions.&quot;</p>
<p>Dudley said Cunanan grew angry during the conversation. He became agitated and he got up and kicked the wall and said: &quot;If I find out who did this to me, I'm gonna get them,&quot; Dudley said.</p>
<p>FBI agents have been hunting Cunanan, described as a gregarious, charming male prostitute who lived off wealthy, older gay patrons. He is also wanted in connection with four other murders.</p>
<p>Police say they do not know if fashion designer Versace had any relationship with Cunanan, 27, although reports say the two men had met at least once in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Cunanan never told Dudley whether he had tested positive for HIV.</p>
