<p>French unemployment, a major blot on the centre-right government's record less than a month ahead of a parliamentary election, fell by 4,800 in March, the labour ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The number of jobless fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent to 3,087,500, but the unemployment rate, based on International Labour Organisation (ILO) criteria, stayed at the record 12.8 percent which it hit in February.  </p>
<p>&quot;The fall is most marked for young people less than 25 years old, where the fall was 7,600, or 1.3 percent, with the decline especially among young men, at 1.8 percent,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Economists said the data would be helpful for the ruling centre-right ruling coalition but that the numbers should be treated with caution at such a sensitive time, before the two-round parliamentary election on May 25 and June 1.</p>
<p>&quot;In an electoral campaign environment these figures have to be taken with a pinch of salt. It looks like unemployment data is not meant to interfere with the campaign,&quot; said JP Morgan economist David Naude. &quot;Needless to say in the current environment these figures are of little informative value.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not quite as stark as in the U.K. (Britain) but it's the same situation in that the headline numbers are not behaving in the same way as the ILO numbers. It's clear the labour market in France is still pretty soft,&quot; said Sean Shepley, economist at CS First Boston.</p>
