<p>Dutch chemicals group DSM on Tuesday unveiled a billion-guilder acquisition to boost its position as a leading European polyolefins producer in the new millennium.</p>
<p>The acquisition and expansion of Vestolen GmbH's polyolefin activities at Gelsenkirchen, Germany, will involve an investment of one billion guilders spread over several years, DSM said.</p>
<p>It declined to disclose the purchase price, which it told analysts would be financed from existing cash flow.</p>
<p>Under the deal, DSM -- currently Europe's fifth largest polyolefins producer -- will take over the polyolefin activities of Vestolen, a unit of German oil refiner Veba Oel AG .</p>
<p>Vestolen's Gelsenkirchen site has a polyethylene production capacity of 150,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) and 200,000 TPA polypropylene.</p>
<p>Over the coming years DSM plans to step up production at the site by building a 300,000 TPA linear low-density polyethylene gas-phase plant and a 250,000 polypropylene gas phase plant.</p>
<p>&quot;After completing the projects in 2001, DSM will be one of the leading producers of polyethylene and polypropylene in Europe, with the lowest possible costs, a broad polyolefins portfolio and world-scale technological capabilities,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>By the millennium DSM's total polyolefins capacity will exceed 2.5 million tonnes a year, it said. Current annual polyolefin capacity at DSM's Geleen plant is 1.52 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The polyolefins business is an important and profitable building block in our portfolio,&quot; DSM chairman Simon de Bree said.</p>
<p>&quot;(The deal) secures our existing strong position as supplier of polyethylene well into the first decade of the next century.&quot;</p>
<p>The agreement is aimed at meeting the strong growth in global demand for polyethylene, used in packaging articles such as bottles, bags and films, and polypropylene, used in packaging, textile fibres and plastic car parts.</p>
<p>DSM said its existing site in Geleen, one of the world's largest integrated production complexes for polyethylene and polypropylene, offered too little scope for expansion.</p>
<p>Consequently DSM said it was opting for a &quot;Buy and Build&quot; approach.</p>
<p>&quot;By acquiring an existing site which offers scope for expansion and guarantees a secure supply of ethylene and propylene, DSM can copy its successful 'Geleen model' in polyolefins,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>These feedstocks will be supplied to Gelsenkirchen by Veba Oel from the production plants of of Ruhr Oel, its 50-50 joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela.</p>
<p>On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, DSM shares opened 5.50 guilders higher on the news at 230.00, touching 233 guilders before settling at 228.50 at mid-morning in a strongly higher market.</p>
<p>Analysts were also broadly upbeat on the news, although some said the move had taken them a little by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;We had been expecting an expansion in fine chemicals, and now it's plastics,&quot; said Patrick Rutten, chemicals analyst with Van Lanschot Bankiers.</p>
<p>&quot;Positive is the fact that this will make DSM European market leader by 2001 -- there is sure to be concentration in the sector but DSM has stolen a march on the competition.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the deal was not expected to contribute to earnings in the first two years, but over the longer term it would hike profits per share by an average 4-6 guilders a year over the full industry cycle.</p>
<p>DSM posted 1996 net profits of 720 million guilders or 23.83 guilders per share, down from a year-earlier 1.07 billion or 29.60 per share.</p>
