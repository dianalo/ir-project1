<title>THAILAND: Thai baht steady late, interbank rate down.</title>
<headline>Thai baht steady late, interbank rate down.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-05-22</dateline>

<p>The Thai baht was steady against the dollar in offshore and local markets as most players had already squared their positions, dealers said.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted at 25.550/25.650 to the dollar in the offshore market against 25.560/25.660 early. In the local market, the baht was traded at around 25.780/25.800 against 25.770/25.790 early.</p>
<p>The central bank fixed the mid-rate at 25.75 per dollar versus 25.71 on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the central bank maintained its ban on short-term baht lending to foreign buyers following heavy offshore speculative attacks on the baht last week.</p>
<p>The order to Thai-based banks not to quote dollar/baht swap rates to foreign buyers has sharply tightened baht supply in the offshore market where the Thai unit is being traded higher than the midrate and the level in the local market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quiet as usual. Most local players already squared their positions,&quot; said one dealer at a European bank.  </p>
<p>The one-month baht/dollar swap premium rose to 40/60 satangs per dollar (bid/offer) from 10/20 in the morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate declined to 11.25-11.50 percent late from 11.50-12.00 in the morning on rising liquidity after the close of central bank's reserve deadline, dealers said.</p>
<p>All commercial banks have to meet the Bank of Thailand's reserve requirement on the seventh and 22nd of every month.</p>
