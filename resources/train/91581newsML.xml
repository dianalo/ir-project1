<p>Officials of two Pakistani Islamic parties on Wednesday censured Afghanistan's radical Taleban movement for its latest decrees enforcing a purist brand of Islam after it conquered Kabul.</p>
<p>Both Jamaat-i-Islami party deputy leader Ghafoor Ahmed and Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan vice-president Shah Faridul Haq said orders barring women from education and work and from going out of their homes without the &quot;hejab&quot; veil, and ordering men to grow long beards, could paint a negative image of Islam.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no justification to close down schools and colleges for women or restrict their education, nor to ban employment of women in offices,&quot; Ahmed told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;In Islam there is no supression,&quot; he said. &quot;Such extremist steps will damage the name of Islam, which embraces the concept of a welfare state and emphasises justice.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jamaat, the most well-organised of Pakistan's Islamic parties, sent its militants into Afghanistan to fight the Soviet occupation in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Ahmed urged Taleban leaders to avoid repressive measures, which he said would not help bring peace to their war-torn country.</p>
<p>&quot;These decisions are made in haste,&quot; Ahmed said of Taleban's decrees after the movement's militia captured Kabul on Friday, ousting President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government.</p>
<p>&quot;Education for women is as necessary as for men...while there is no fixed standard for hejab (veil),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some of the steps taken by Taleban had damaged the name of Islam and portrayed a false picture, he said.</p>
<p>Ahmed said he had no sympathy for former Afghan president Najibullah, who was executed by Taleban fighters after they captured Kabul and hanged from a concrete traffic post.</p>
<p>But he added that the ex-president should not have been killed without a trial. &quot;And the most important thing is that Islam does not allow the desecration of a body.&quot;</p>
<p>Shah Faridul Haq said he fully supported the steps taken by Taleban, but advised them to go slowly and have patience.</p>
<p>He said Taleban belonged to a radical Islamic school of thought where strict adherence to all Islamic rules is compulsory. &quot;They should go slow in enforcing Islam as haste could damage the process of its implementation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Growing the beard in Islam is obligatory but one does not become an infidel without it. It is disobedience.&quot;</p>
