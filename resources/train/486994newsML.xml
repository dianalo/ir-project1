<title>USA: NY precious metals recover to end mostly higher.</title>
<headline>NY precious metals recover to end mostly higher.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures recovered slightly from early weakness Friday to end mostly higher, after silver led the complex lower for most of the week.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unlikely that silver prices will linger at these low levels for long given the strong demand for physical silver from fabricators,&quot; CPM Group New York analyst Ted Kempf said.</p>
<p>COMEX May silver closed up 1.2 cents at $4.740 an ounce, after an inside-range-day, following the slump to a contract low at $4.655 Thursday.  </p>
<p>Daily momentum oscillators for May silver also reached oversold levels Thursday, with a five-day slow stochastic at 17 percent and a nine-day RSI at 17 percent.</p>
<p>Fund liquidation of long positions and unwinding of gold/silver spread plays was said to have been behind this week's slump in silver prices which took the spot price down to two-and-a-half month lows.</p>
<p>The spot/gold silver ratio was little changed around 73.5, after recovering steadily in the past month from a 22-month low at 66.5 in mid-February.  </p>
<p>COMEX June gold ended up 30 cents at $351.80 an ounce, with the contract still seen trapped in the $350-355 range it has been in for the past month.</p>
<p>&quot;But gold tends to make a move one way or the other when it reaches levels of open interest that are either unsustainably high or low like they are now,&quot; North American Equity Services COMEX floor trader, John Geraghty said.</p>
<p>COMEX gold open interest fell a further 1,415 lots Thursday to 150,505 contracts, the lowest level since January 1996.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $348.50/00, compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $347.40, and the New York close Thursday around $348.50/00.</p>
<p>Gold prices had held up well in US dollar terms, given the sharp rise in bond yields, in the past week following the U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening last week, analysts said.</p>
<p>The rise in gold holding costs, caused by rising interest rates, may have been offset though by the attraction of precious metals as the U.S. stock market fell sharply and the U.S. dollar weakened, analysts said.</p>
<p>In corporate news that improved sentiment about gold, Santa Fe Pacific Gold said Friday it had closed out remaining purchased put options representing 900,000 ounces of gold and its written call options on 300,000 ounces of gold, receiving $17 million from the transaction.</p>
<p>In addition, between January and March 300,000 ounces worth of put options were exercised with $6.7 million cash received and 100,000 ounces worth of calls expired unexercised.</p>
<p>The options were purchased in 1995 and had a strike price of $375, Santa Fe chairman Patrick James said.</p>
<p>In the platinum metals group, NYMEX July platinum ended down $4.10 at $365.00 an ounce, but NYMEX June palladium closed up $1.20 at $149.00.</p>
<p>In news Friday, Vladimir Rybkin, the head of the precious metals division of Russia's Finance Ministry, said he still did not know when a decree would be issued providing administrative authority for resumption of palladium exports to Japan, though it was expected this month.</p>
<p>Russian palladium shipments to Japan have been suspended since December, after annual supply contract talks broke down.</p>
