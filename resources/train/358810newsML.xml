<p>Asian crude prices edged down in quiet talk on Wednesday ahead of the Chinese New Year, traders said.</p>
<p>Market activity was generally slow also because Middle Eastern cargoes for March and regional barrels for February have mostly been placed, they added.</p>
<p>In the physical market, about 100,000 barrels of February Minas crude was said to have been sold from a Japanese trading house to a Japanese refiner at around ICP plus 75 cents, traders said.  </p>
<p>A Japanese trading house was said to be offering March Minas as low as ICP plus 50 cents. February cargoes were mostly traded above ICP plus $1.00.</p>
<p>Amid the sharp decline in Minas premiums, most market participants were stuck on the sidelines, unsure of prevailing market levels for March cargoes, traders said.</p>
<p>In Malaysian crudes, March Tapis was sold to New Zealand at about APPI plus $1.30, traders said.</p>
<p>Some traders said that the price is a little too high, and that there might be some special conditions attached to the deal.  </p>
<p>In Middle Eastern grades, a European major was said to be holding one Lower Zakum cargo for March, and another European major was rumoured to have one Dubai and one Oman cargo to sell in the market.</p>
<p>There are, however, few potential buyers in the region for the remaining March cargoes, traders said.</p>
<p>Trading in Asia is expected to remain quiet for the rest of the week with China and Hong Kong starting the Lunar New Year holiday on Thursday, and Singapore on Friday.</p>
