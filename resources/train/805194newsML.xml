<title>KENYA: Kenya shilling hits new low.</title>

<p>The Kenyan shilling suffered fresh losses on Monday, touching a new low as foreign investors pulled out of the market amid political and economic uncertainty, commercial bank dealers said.</p>
<p>The shilling depreciated by 1.3 percent on Monday morning to trade at a commercial mean rate of 70.68 from 69.75.</p>
<p>The shilling's latest movements brought its total losses to 18.79 percent since the International Monetary Fund cancelled a key aid package to Kenya citing corruption on July 31.</p>
<p>&quot;It's chaotic right now. We were already at the bottom and now it looks like we're going to begin the slide again,&quot; a senior dealer told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Dealers said some foreign investors ignored last Friday's appeal by Central Bank of Kenya governor Micah Cheserem not to abandon the Kenyan market.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is there. Almost five billion shillings of treasury bills from last week's auction were not rolled over and this is what they are looking for,&quot; one dealer told Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>Cheserem, alarmed by a rapid outflow of dollars fuelled by the row with the IMF and pre-election tensions, spoke after investors pulled out of Thursday's usually lucrative weekly auction of high-yield treasury bills citing market uncertainty.</p>
<p>The bank only managed to sell 50 percent of the 14 billion-shilling bills offered.</p>
<p>The IMF's suspension of the $205-million Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), over concerns on corruption and governance, led the World Bank to delay its own disbursements of up to $71.6 million.</p>
<p>Cheserem has refused to intervene decisively to boost the shilling, saying he would leave the currency to defend itself in the market.</p>
