<headline>Dow slips losses to storm higher, NYSE curbs on.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average shook off earlier losses this morning and stormed higher, with the Dow rising 51 points to 7746.</p>
<p>The gains prompted the New York Stock Exchange to set curbs on index-arbitrage trading curbs at 1521 EDT/1921 GMT, only about an hour after it took off the same curbs due to heavy losses in the blue chip average.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was up seven to about 908.  </p>
<p>While those two indices of large, well-known companies shook off their earlier losses, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 remained mired in modest losses.</p>
<p>The long bond was up 11/32 to yield 6.52 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the gains were made as some investors sought an entry point after Friday's losses.  But many were still unsure of the short-term direction of blue chip stocks, accounting for today's see-sawing in equities.</p>
<p>The Dow started the session with gains of about 30 points before dipping to losses that prompted the earlier NYSE curbs on program trading.</p>
