<p>World motor racing authorities are unlikely to sanction any events in Italy if Formula One chief Frank Williams is convicted of manslaughter over the death of Ayrton Senna nearly three years ago.</p>
<p>The head of the Williams' team and five others go on trial in Imola this Thursday.</p>
<p>FIA president Max Mosley has already hinted that the world governing body would take some action if the six are found guilty.</p>
<p>And although Mosley has declined to outline what he has in mind, a logical move would be to withdraw approval for the 34 events currently held in Italy, including the San Marino Grand Prix in which Senna was killed on May 1, 1994.</p>
<p>Flavio Briatore, head of the Benetton team, has already said he would be unwilling to race in Italy if Williams is convicted.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not risk bringing my team to a country that  can convict you for an accident,&quot; he said last December. &quot;Fatality is part of the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Briatore was backed a few days later by Ken Tyrrell, another team chief, who said he did not think it would be possible to get insurance cover for possible criminal charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Motor racing is a dangerous sport,&quot; Tyrrell commented.</p>
<p>This year's San Marino Grand Prix scheduled for April 27 is not threatened as the case could languish in the courts for years under Italy's notoriously slow legal system.</p>
<p>The trial itself is expected to take at least six months and appeal processes could drag the process out for up to seven years.</p>
<p>FIA, though, could act well before any decision is reached in order to thwart future prosecutions.</p>
<p>One suggestion is for FIA to persuade the Italian government to introduce a law removing the risk of prosecution for accidents in a sport which is inherently dangerous.</p>
<p>Brazilian Senna, a three times world champion, suffered fatal head injuries when his Williams' car crashed into a wall on the Imola course's Tamburello curve.</p>
<p>A report for Bologna prosecutor Maurizio Passarini, who led the investigation, concluded that the car's steering column had been modified and snapped as a result of a poor weld as the vehicle took the curve.</p>
<p>The Williams' team has argued that the steering column was intact at the moment of impact.</p>
<p>The other men charged are Williams' technical director Patrick Head, chief designer Adrian Newey, Belgian international race director Roland Bruynseraede, Imola race track director Frederico Bendinelli and a former track official Giorgio Poggi. All deny the charge.</p>
