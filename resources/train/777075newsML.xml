<p>Spain's Gas Natural is set to bounce back from a disappointing first half as the economy continues its recovery, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Spain's gas supplier said attributable profit fell 0.9 percent to 26.12 billion pesetas from 26.36 billion in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Analysts said one surprising element of the results was the extent to which unit sales margins had declined in both industrial and domestic segments.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't expect such a sharp fall in margins. Gas Natural benefited for a long time from (rises in) regulated tariffs...With the government's drive to curb inflation, this has meant lower gas prices and deteriorated margins&quot; said an analyst at Inverban brokerage in Madrid.</p>
<p>Behind the lacklustre performance was a fall of almost 11 percent in operating profits to 39.36 billion pesetas, and a rise in depreciation charges to 21.17 billion pesetas from 14.25 billion.</p>
<p>Shares in Gas Natural underperformed the market following the release of the full figures on Monday. At 1345 GMT, the share was trading 240 pesetas or 3.31 percent lower at 7,010, while the Ibex-35 blue chip index was off 1.99 percent at 6,596.76.</p>
<p>Margins had been hit by lower gas tariffs and a narrower spread between purchase and sales prices, the firm said. Sales in the first three months of the year were dulled by the unusually mild winter.</p>
<p>Results were also affected by an asset restatement, which means higher depreciation charges are sapping the bottom line.</p>
<p>The government last year approved measures obliging firms to revalue their fixed assets. This will mean bigger depreciation charges this year, although there will be a beneficial tax effect next year.</p>
<p>The April to June performance was an improvement on the first quarter thanks to increased sales to industrial clients and the initial effects of the economic recovery, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be noted that in both (operating and net profit) the trend in the second quarter improved from the first, mainly benefiting from the increase in industrial sales and the bigger rise in the number of clients,&quot; Gas Natural said in its results statement.</p>
<p>The second half should see the positive trend continue, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;This year will be one in which the firm will go from weakness to strength, that is, after a mild winter impacting results in the first half, we're expecting a pick-up in economic activity to impact industrial business in the second half,&quot; the Inverban analyst added.</p>
<p>The brokerage expects a nine percent increase in profits to 53 billion pesetas in 1997, and an 18 percent rise in cash flow.</p>
<p>An analyst at a foreign brokerage said he was considering upgrading his &quot;sell&quot; recommendation on Gas Natural after these results.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the second quarter compared with the first you can see clearly that they're coming out of the dip. I think the stock has turned the corner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He agreed that the economic recovery should continue to mean growth in sales to industrial clients, and forecast a six percent rise in profits by year end.</p>
