<p>Almost 50 people on board a Russian AN-24 passenger plane died when the aircraft crashed in southern Russia on Tuesday, an airline representative said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nobody alive,&quot; said Mustafa Seyis of the Slotur agency which represents the plane's Russian owners in Turkey. The plane was on a flight from Stavropol in Russia to Trabzon on Turkey's northeastern Black Sea coast.</p>
<p>&quot;It crashed 37 minutes after take-off from Stavropol,&quot; Seyis said. He said he had spoken to officials at Stavropol airport by telephone.</p>
<p>He said the plane had 41 passengers and eight crew members on board, all of them Russians. Many were travelling to Trabzon for commerce in light goods.</p>
<p>The aircraft crashed in a forest near the town of Cherkessk, capital of the ethnic region of Karachayevo-Cherkessiya, at 10.50 a.m. (0750 GMT), a spokesman for Russia's emergency ministry said in Moscow.</p>
<p>He gave no reason for the crash. Russia's air safety standards have plunged since the Soviet state carrier Aeroflot was split into hundreds of smaller domestic companies during market reforms.</p>
<p>The government-owned Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily newspaper said earlier this week that 219 people had been killed last year in 43 air accidents in Russian air space.</p>
