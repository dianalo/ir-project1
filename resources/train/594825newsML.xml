<p>A recovery in the global chip market and the yen's steep decline against the dollar helped Japan's Rohm Co Ltd post healthy gains in its annual earnings, the company said on Monday.</p>
<p>Rohm, a major specialist manufacturer of integrated circuits, said its group net profits jumped 19.2 percent to 45.54 billion yen ($392 million) in the year that ended in March.</p>
<p>Rohm's parent current profits also grew, rising 9.1 percent to 46.247 billion yen ($398 million) from a year ago. Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses on non-operating activities such as investments in stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>A strong earnings report had already been widely anticipated by investors.</p>
<p>Rohm shares hit a high of 10,500 yen on the Osaka bourse just before the earnings announcement on Monday, but profit-taking trimmed the gains and they ended the day up 100 yen at 10,100.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a broad sense that we are running out of (positive) factors in terms of Rohm's earnings,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Rohm, whose export ratio stood at 38.5 percent, posted currency profits of 2.58 billion yen ($22.2 million) in 1996/97, sharply up from 160 million yen ($1.37 million) a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;The weaker yen had a positive impact on our earnings indeed, but it was not the only good factor,&quot; a Rohm spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said chip sales rose due to a recovery in demand for semiconductors in mobile phones and personal computers in the United States and Europe during the latter half of 1996/97.</p>
<p>The company expected the mild uptrend in profits to continue, fuelled by operations targeting the multi-media market.</p>
<p>For the current fiscal year, which started on April 1, Rohm forecast that its group net profits would grow to 51 billion yen ($439 million) and its parent current profits would rise to 50 billion yen ($431 million). ($1=116 yen)</p>
