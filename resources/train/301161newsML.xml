<p>Japan and Hong Kong stock markets are facing a tough week ahead despite a dramatic turnaround on Wall Street on Friday that saw the Dow Jones index erase a nearly-70 point opening tumble to set another record.</p>
<p>Analysts in Tokyo said Japanese stocks could be trapped in a tailspin amid gloom over the economy and a lack of a clear market support level to spark investor buying.</p>
<p>Brokers in Hong Kong said Dow Jones' rebound on blue chip buying, ignoring a strong monthly U.S. employment figures, brought little cheers to the Hong Kong market.</p>
<p>They said concern about a possible U.S. interest rate hike and possible government measures to curb local property speculation would pressure stock prices.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Taiwan shares are expected to rise further in the coming week helped by government-supported funds.</p>
<p>Traders also see higher prices for Singapore and Malaysian stocks. TOKYO - Analysts said Wall Street's sharp rise on Friday failed to cheer up the Japanese market.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in U.S. stocks is a positive factor for the Japanese stocks, but on the other hand there is much concern about how long the Dow will keep on rising,&quot; said Yasuo Ueki of Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Any signs of weakness in the U.S. market would cause a great deal of harm to Japanese stocks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the market's Nikkei average plunged another 4.26 percent to 17,303.65, continuing the downward spiral without any firm support points standing in the way from around 21,800 in early December.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the key 225-share Nikkei stock index could plummet towards the low of 14,295 seen in July 1995, the second major bottom on charts after the bursting of the &quot;bubble economy&quot; of inflated Japanese assets in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't see any reasonable supporting points,&quot; said Koichi Ichiko, general manager of the securities investment department at Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co.</p>
<p>&quot;It all depends on whether the government will propose any new policies.&quot;</p>

<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks face a tough week ahead with concerns about interest rates, plummeting Japanese shares and possible curbs on property speculation seen pressuring prices.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index fell 31.29 points, or 0.24 percent, this week to close at 13,190.50 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though the Dow Jones finally gained 78 points, I think an imminent interest rate hike will overshadow the stock market,&quot; said Patrick Chia, research director at China Everbright Research.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Hang Seng index could test 13,000 points in the upcoming week and fall below that level if the government imposes harsh measures to reign in escalating property prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Property counters may continue to be under selling pressure and the market may try to consolidate,&quot; said Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index is expected to ease in the coming week with profit-taking in finance counters, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Positive news from a government plan to slash budgets in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and on new funds being set up to help property firms, will produce no impact as they would have been discounted by investors,&quot; said an analyst at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>The SET index closed at 840.50 on Friday, up from 787.47 last Friday.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>BOMBAY - Sustained buying by foreign funds and speculative bidding are likely to spur Indian shares but profit-taking at higher levels will limit sharp gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>Widespread market expectations of tax breaks and positive government announcements will be the key factors, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Speculators have taken long positions. There is all-round optimism in the market,&quot; said dealer Purvesh Shah at Nucleus Securities, a local brokerage.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange's top 30-share index rallied 154.26 points, or 4.7 percent, to end at 3,418.32 in the week to Friday -- up nearly 11 percent since the close of 1996.</p>

<p>COLOMBO - Sri Lanka stocks, which closed on an upbeat note, should continue moving up on local support, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Locals will continue to move the market up, but volumes will be thin until foreign investors come in with their new year allocations,&quot; said Nandakumar Nair, head of research at brokerage John Keells.</p>
<p>On Friday the all-share index closed at 617.52, up 1.7 percent, or 10.11 points from the previous week.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>DHAKA - Brokers said the downward trend on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) may prevail through the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan beginning Saturday.</p>
<p>Turnover was thin during the past week and was unlikely to pick up soon, they said.</p>
<p>The DSE all-share index lost 349.60 points at 2,100.96 in the week to Thursday. The markets are closed on Fridays.</p>

<p>JAKARTA - Jakarta share prices are expected to be mixed, with overseas buying of big-capitalised stocks boosting sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Local investors showed strong buying interest this week. I expect it will continue with some speculation pushing sentiment,&quot; a local broker said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Jakarta Composite Index closed at 657.87 points, up 11.68 points or 1.8 percent against last's week close of 646.19 points.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>KARACHI - Pakistani stocks are expected to open higher after the Friday-Saturday weekend on speculative buying by short-term players after rumours of a possible declaration of financial emergency faded, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a bullish rally in the next trading week after the rumour has faded,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Karachi Stock Exchange's 100-share index closed 8.39 points, or 0.62 percent, up at 1,356.63.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Dealers and analysts said the Composite Index was technically still on an uptrend but views were mixed as to how much further it had to go before a correction set in.</p>
<p>&quot;The Composite Index is still on an uptrend, but the blue chips are near their fair valuations,&quot; said a dealer at a local equities brokerage house.</p>
<p>&quot;There will probably be more volume next week. But we are still taking our lead from New York,&quot; said Jonathan Duckett, an institutional dealer at Mohaiyani Securities in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Large-capitalised, blue-chip stocks would continue to be sought selectively, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>The Composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks rose 0.93 points to 1,232.38 in the week ending Friday.</p>

<p>SEOUL - Developments in nationwide strikes will be a bellwether for Seoul stock investors, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the strike situation becomes more complicated and drags out, it's not going to be good for the economy,&quot; said broker Rhee Joo-ik of Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>But overall sentiment has improved, brokers said, boosted by the government's intention to reform the financial industry.</p>
<p>The nationwide strikes erupted on December 26 in protest at a new labour bill that allows employers to layoff workers.</p>
<p>On Friday, the stock index closed at 648.69, 5.1 points or 0.78 percent lower than last Friday's closing of 653.79.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SINGAPORE - Dealers said they expected shares to remain firm, with focus still on electronic issues.</p>
<p>Sentiment will be cautious after recent sharp gains but retail interest in small issues and electronic issues is expected to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;The market undertone is still firm. The sharp fall in Tokyo stocks could benefit regional markets and Singapore is bound to get some allocation,&quot; said a dealer with a local broking firm.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrial index ended at 2,242.31 on Friday, up 18.23 points from a week ago.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares are seen marching to Wall Street's tune in the near term with more U.S. economic data coming out later in the week being the focus for many players.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,418.6, up 19.1 points over the past week, after touching a record high of 2,438.8 early on Friday.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to stage further gains next week on loose market liquidity and signs of government-supported fund entries, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the weighted index ended at 7,118.07, up 23.30 points on the day and compared with 6,820.35 last Saturady when the marekt reopened after the new year holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest rates are low now, so liquidity is fairly loose and that should push share prices higher in the near term,&quot; said Albert Lin, research manager of Golden Securities.</p>
<p>However, profit-taking could emerge as the index edged higher, Lin said.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - Brokers said the next major drive of New Zealand shares would be December quarter inflation data due on Friday.</p>
<p>The market closed firmer on Friday but brokers said their retreat from intraday highs may have signalled a temporary end to their weeklong rally. The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed at 2,406.81, up 36.6 points on the previous week's close and 4.45 points on the day. It had, however, reached a high of 2,427.14 during Friday's session.</p>
<p>&quot;I think today (Friday) will disappoint some people and going into next week we might see a softer tone,&quot; said John Rattray at Ord Minnett.</p>
