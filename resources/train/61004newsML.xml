<p>Experts said on Wednesday that abnormal readings in the &quot;sarcophagus&quot; housing the Chernobyl nuclear plant's ruined fourth reactor posed no immediate threat but stressed that the cracking structure had to be replaced.</p>
<p>In Vienna, Ukraine's top negotiator on closing Chernobyl acknowledged the increase of neutron activity inside the sarcophagus which was hurriedly erected after the fire and explosion at the plant 10 years ago.</p>
<p>But Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko, attending an International Atomic Energy Agency's conference, said there had been no rise in radiation or temperature. He suggested faulty meters could have given rogue readings but said if the readings were true they needed quick investigation.</p>
<p>The European Commission, which has pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to help shut the plant, urged Ukraine to provide full information on the increased readings, noted twice in the past week.</p>
<p>Patrick Michaille, a French expert working in Kiev, said increased radiation had probably been caused by heavy rains but was far below levels posing a public danger. He discounted faulty equipment as a cause.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a remote chance that if it were repeated it could cause a chain reaction through an accumulation of nuclear fuel and moisture in some parts of the sarcophagus, but this is most improbable,&quot; Michaille said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The sarcophagus was meant to be built for 30 years and it can probably last that long. But you cannot leave it forever. The key is to take our time and settle on one that meets international standards at an affordable cost.&quot;</p>
<p>Ukraine's nuclear authority has ordered an enquiry into the increased readings and to determine whether they could lead to nuclear reactions. Past investigations into three such sets of incidents in the past decade have proved inconclusive.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials say rebuilding the sarcophagus is a top priority in keeping to President Leonid Kuchma's promise to close down Chernobyl's two working reactors by the year 2000. One reactor is to be shut by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Experts estimate that between 90 and 160 tonnes of mangled fuel remain inside. About 1,000 square metres of cracks remain on the surface despite repeated campaigns to patch them up.</p>
<p>Kuchma's press secretary Dmytro Markov said the president was alarmed at what Ukraine saw as slow progress in releasing more than $3 billion promised by the Group of Seven wealthy countries to close the Chernobyl plant.</p>
<p>&quot;The president hopes that in the near future the aid process will be speeded up and that this will enable Ukraine to meet its commitment to shut down Chernobyl,&quot; Markov told a news conference. &quot;We see the sarcophagus as the main problem. This is truly an international problem to be resolved together.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuchma was due on Thursday to meet Claude Mandil, the head of a G-7 nuclear safety group. Diplomatic sources said Mandil was carrying a response from French President Jacques Chirac, current G-7 chairman, on Ukraine's request to speed up aid.</p>
<p>A Franco-British plan to build a new sarcophagus, estimated to cost $1.2 billion, was made public in 1993, but no steps have yet been taken to build it. The winner of a new tender to build a cheaper version is to be announced next month.</p>
<p>&quot;That project imposed unrealistic constraints on designers. The cost was beyond what the world community was prepared to pay,&quot; Michaille said. &quot;We need new design criteria to decide how to deal with what amounts to a wound in this country.&quot;</p>
