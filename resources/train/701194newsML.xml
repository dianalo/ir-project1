<p>Latvian overnight rates were high for the start of the month as banks scrambled to meet liquidity requirements and the lat-dollar was seen stable on a quiet market laid low by summer, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Overnight rates climbed on Wednesday to 3.50/4.50 from 3.30/4.30 on Tuesday and the market was very active.</p>
<p>&quot;We borrowed three to four million lats on the overnight market on Tuesday and other banks were also very active,&quot; a dealer with Hansabank-Latvija told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Usually rates are not so high at the start of the month, but banks seem to be a little short on lats at the moment,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Dealers cited a 12 million lat syndicated loan to Latellekom last month as a reason behind the slight shortage of lats.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the central bank's lat-dollar rate edged up to 0.5706/0.5822 from 0.5706/0.5821 in the morning. The commercial bank rates were close at 0.5719/0.5723.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the market was very quiet because of summer and that future fluctuations would be determined by the dollar's movements against other major currencies.</p>
<p>Dealers said that no big local deals were looming on the horizon which would push up demand for either dollars or lats.</p>
