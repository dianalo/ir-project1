<p>Pen pictures of the Juventus players most likely to appear in Saturday's serie A clash with Vicenza at the Delle Alpi stadium in Turin.</p>
<p>Michelangelo Rampulla, goalkeeper, 34. Calm reserve goalkeeper with five seasons at Juve behind him. Expected to be preferred to regular first choice Angelo Peruzzi, the Italy goalkeeper, who has a back strain and is struggling to be fit for next week's European Cup match against Rosenborg.</p>
<p>Moreno Torricelli, defender, 27. Long-haired former carpenter discovered as amateur by Juventus in 1992. Tough. capable of moving forward to good effect. Has been getting progressively better this season after injury.</p>
<p>Ciro Ferrara, defender, 30. Italian international who served with Diego Maradona in great Napoli team before joining Juve in 1994. One of the pillars of the Juventus defence, with Paolo Montero, and has the experience and maturity to guide the others. Can also score the occasional goal.</p>
<p>Paolo Montero, defender, 25. Uruguayan international who made a splash in his early days when he clashed with a photographer at Vicenza. Has grown in stature since and now seen as an indispensable member of team.</p>
<p>Mark Iuliano, defender, 23. Signed in close season from second division Salernitana. Made a slow start but has grown more settled and should get a start on Saturday.</p>
<p>Alessio Tacchinardi, defender, 21. Product of Juventus youth team. Started as midfielder but switched to sweeper by coach Marcello Lippi. Should revert to midfield role if, as expected, he takes place of disqualified Zinedine Zidane.</p>
<p>Angelo Di Livio, midfielder, 30. Italian international who was born in Rome and started at Roma. He moved on after one season without a full serie A match. Then spent nine years in second and third divisions before joining Juventus in 1994 and helping them win league title in 1995.</p>
<p>Vladimir Jugovic, midfielder, 27. Former Red Star Belgrade and Sampdoria player. Skilful ball-winner who likes to get forward into shooting positions. Also won European Cup with Red Star in 1991. Keeps on going for full 90 minutes.</p>
<p>Attilio Lombardo, midfielder, 31. Balding veteran of Sampdoria's 1991 league title winning team. Still very fast, played last weekend and likely to be called up to cover for absent Frenchmen Zidane and Didier Deschamps.</p>
<p>Alessandro Del Piero, striker, 22. Natural replacement for Roberto Baggio, signed until year 2000. Deadly from free-kicks on edge of area and has been at his best in recent matches, even scoring headers for the first time in his career. Last weekend notched up his 50th goal for Juventus.</p>
<p>Michele Padovano, striker, 30. Formerly with Genoa and Napoli, probably most under-rated striker in serie A, certainly the fastest. Deadly on counter-attack. Scored winner against Real Madrid in 1995 European Cup quarter-final.</p>
<p>Alen Boksic, striker, 27. Key player after three frustrating years at Lazio. Powerful son of a Croatian truck driver from Split, started out at Hajduk before moving to France. Has shown old Lazio habit of making more goals than he scores. Was due to return from ankle injury against Vicenza but now looking more doubtful. Has not played since January 12.</p>
<p>Christian Vieri, striker, 23. Italian who learnt his football in Australia before playing for Venice and Atalanta. Bought by Juventus in close season to replace Gianluca Vialli. Has the physique but not the finesse although has been a useful replacement for injured players in recent matches.</p>
