<p>The Russian government has asked President Boris Yeltsin to sack Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov over allegations that he was filmed in a sauna with naked women, Itar-Tass news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It quoted Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, as saying the president was likely to decide on Kovalyov's fate in a week's time. He said Yeltsin had ordered an investigation into the scandal and into how the video film alleged to feature the minister had reached the media.</p>
<p>The monthly newspaper Sovershenno Sekretno (Top Secret) last week published grainy snaps taken from a video which it said showed Kovalyov with naked women in September 1995 in the sauna of a gangland nightclub.</p>
<p>Kovalyov became justice minister in January 1995. He has denied doing anything wrong but has said he wanted the president to suspend him from his duties while he clears his name.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had received both Kovalyov's request to be suspended temporarily and the formal government resolution asking the president to sack Kovalyov altogether.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was informed of the scandal while attending the annual summit of the Group of Seven main industrialised nations in the U.S. city of Denver over the weekend, Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>The scandal has turned into a far more convoluted affair than a simple Western-style &quot;sleaze&quot; story. Attention has focused on the motives for the release of the video tape rather than on whether Kovalyov was actually involved.</p>
<p>&quot;The very fact that such materials have been disclosed can lead to a criminal case,&quot; Yastrzhembsky told Tass.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, indicating he thought the tape was genuine, has said it was seized by police earlier this year when they arrested a Moscow banker for theft. He said its release was an attempt to undermine the case against him.</p>
<p>First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said on Monday that an investigation had been launched into the Kovalyov case.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said  Kovalyov, who resigned from the Communist party on being made a minister two years ago, was planning to sue the Sovershenno Sekretno newspaper for breach of privacy.</p>
<p>A former law professor, the 53-year-old Kovalyov is also a member of the Kremlin's top-level Security Council.</p>
<p>In a country with deeply entrenched traditions of official secrecy, few if any ministers have stepped down because of any kind of scandal.</p>
