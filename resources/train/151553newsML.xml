<p>Secondary aluminium output by Germany's leading producers is expected to rise to 350,000 tonnes in 1996, up two percent from 1995, a statement from industry association VDS said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The figure applied to 11 VDS member companies, which together accounted for 80 percent of German output.</p>
<p>VDS chairman Erich Oetinger said the trend in output contrasted with unsatisfactory profitability, although this might improve in line with a general economic upswing next year.</p>
<p>Aluminium's recent uptrend on the London Metals Exchange (LME) was also encouraging.</p>
<p>Oetinger said VDS margins were being squeezed as sales prices of casting alloys fell faster than buying-in prices of scrap, which accounted for 75 percent of product prices.</p>
<p>The gap was created by import pressure from alloy ingots and the fact that an estimated 160,000 tonnes of scrap would be exported this year rather than processed at home.</p>
<p>High environmental standards had resulted in inflated processing and production costs which discouraged the use of domestic aluminium scrap.</p>
<p>Oetinger said low prices on the LME alloy contract threatened the viability of German operations.</p>
<p>Low-cost producers had used the contract to sell surplus material rather than produce in line with demand trends, he said.</p>
<p>As a result, LME stocks had risen and prices had been eroded while raw materials were tied up in warehouses.</p>
<p>EU anti-dumping duties on Brazilian and Chinese silicon imports were also affecting producer prices.</p>
