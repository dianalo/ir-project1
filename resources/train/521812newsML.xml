<p>Europe's 1999 economic and monetary union will have more serious consequences in Luxembourg than in other financial services centres, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg SA, a major player in the Grand Duchy, said.</p>
<p>Likely tax harmonisation and changes to minimum reserve requirements would level the playing field in banking in the European Union and remove some of the advantages Luxembourg now still enjoys over other financial centres.</p>
<p>&quot;We banks benefitted from overregulation elsewhere,&quot; Ekkehard Storck, managing director of Deutsche Bank Luxembourg -- a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's largest bank -- told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>His remarks had been embargoed for publication on Friday.</p>
<p>Storck denied banks were in Luxembourg because it was a tax haven. Noting the corporate tax burden was a hefty 40 percent, he said, &quot;Tax savings were never a motive for setting up business in Luxembourg.&quot;</p>
<p>However, tax considerations had become more prominent in recent years as competition grew and margins fell.</p>
<p>DB Lux in the past repeatedly called on the Luxembourg government to reduce the tax burden to improve the competitive position of the Grand Duchy as a financial centre.</p>
<p>Steps now being taken were moves in the right direction, but the difference with centres such as London, where the comparable tax burden is 33 percent, and Dublin, where it is 10 percent, remained large.</p>
<p>Storck said labour costs in Luxembourg were also high. A shift towards more performance-related pay was another step in the right direction. Here too, in EMU, gradual harmonisation is likely.</p>
<p>Despite the encouraging moves, DB Lux has decided to move business, in particular areas where margin pressures are largest, out of Luxembourg and to Dublin's reduced-tax International Financial Services Centre.</p>
<p>Relatively high costs had already resulted in banks setting up processing centres, for example in fund management, just outside Luxembourg, Storck said.</p>
<p>Under EU rules banks licenced in one member state can set up freely in another.</p>
<p>Storck said EMU might trigger massive capital flight out of Luxembourg and to non-EU states if it meant a compulsory interest-free minimum reserve, along the lines of Bundesbank rules now applied in Germany, were introduced in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Business might shift en masse to London, assuming that Britain will not be in the first wave of countries entering into EMU at the start of 1999.</p>
<p>The financial services sector employs almost 10 percent of the workforce in Luxembourg and is a key contributor to tax revenue. There are about 220 banks in the Grand Duchy, employing over 20,000 people.</p>
<p>Storck called on a future European central bank to introduce an interest-bearing minimum reserve as part of its interest rate policy instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;This would soften the negative consequences for Luxembourg. However, in any case there would be a levelling effect as regards this specific advantage for the financial market here,&quot; he said.</p>
