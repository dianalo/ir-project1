<headline>FEATURE - Russian banks join ADR bandwagon.</headline>

<p>Russian banks are joining a select group of industrial companies by issuing American Depositary Receipts on Western capital markets, but bankers said the deals would achieve little more for banks other than brightening their image.</p>
<p>Whether the ADR issues will help develop the illiquid market in Russian banking shares is unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;The possibility of issuing ADRs will stimulate the Russian market, its liquidity, quotes and confidence in the stocks,&quot; Sergei Malinin, head of the securities market at MAKB Vozrozhdeniye, one of three banks planning an ADR issue, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Alexander Balatsky, an analyst from Unitrust brokerage, which specialises in banking shares, said ADR issues would do little to help develop the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Vozrozhdeniye is the only bank of the three which tries to support the domestic market for its shares. Now Russian brokers will have a possibility of arbitrage,&quot; he said. &quot;What's to be done with Menatep and Inkombank, which do not even have market-makers here, is unclear.&quot;</p>
<p>Vozrozhdeniye and two other big banks, AB Inkombank and Bank Menatep, recently received permission from Russia's central bank to sell their level-one ADRs to foreign investors.</p>
<p>BANKING SHARES ILLIQUID</p>
<p>The market in bank shares in Russia is almost illiquid and the only really traded share is that of state-owned Sberegatelny Bank RF, Russia's biggest bank, with a dominant position in the household savings market.</p>
<p>Even its shares are not traded on the Russian Trading System, an electronic market resembling the U.S. NASDAQ system, and which accounts for the bulk of Russian share trading.</p>
<p>Most interest in the market appears at the end of the year, when banks pay dividends, share analysts said.</p>
<p>ADRs issued by industrial companies have had a significant impact on the domestic market of their shares.</p>
<p>Such shares have often outperformed the market, not least because the Russian companies involved must become more open to investors, eventually adopting Western-style accounting standards.</p>
<p>ADRs allow foreign investors to trade overseas shares without settlement and custody problems in the issuer's market.</p>
<p>Level-one ADRs give investors access to a company's shares but do not raise new capital. For this level-two or level-three ADRs must be issued, for which the U.S. authorities set stricter reporting requirements.</p>
<p>But even news about a forthcoming ADR issue by a Russian company is enough to push up its share price.</p>
<p>FIRST DEAL WITH RUSSIAN BANK ADRS SEEN IN DECEMBER</p>
<p>The first deal with Inkombank's ADRs will happen in the week beginning December 9, a bank spokesman said, adding that in 1997 or 1998 Inkombank would issue level three and level two ADRs.</p>
<p>All three banks received permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue ADRs but could not sell their shares to foreigners without central bank approval for each deal.</p>
<p>But the central bank limited all three to selling no more than three percent of their authorised capital in ADRs, although they had applied for more.</p>
<p>Vozrozhdeniye, for example, applied for 15 percent of its capital to be issued in ADRs, about the volume currently traded in Russia, Malinin said.</p>
<p>He said he was disappointed by the limit.</p>
<p>&quot;It will only boost our image and is another chance to promote ourselves -- you cannot do anything more with three percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>CENTRAL BANK TO LIMIT ADRS</p>
<p>The central bank said it would minimise the amount of ADRs or Global Depositary Receipts issued by banks as they deprive the Russian market of capital.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to develop the Russian market, not the American one,&quot; said a central bank expert, who asked not to be named. &quot;We do not have enough information about the American market while on our part the legal status of ADRs is not fully worked out.&quot;</p>
<p>The three percent limit rules out ADRs as a vehicle for attracting strategic investors.</p>
<p>But Inkombank vice-president Rafael Nagapetyants said the mere fact his bank's ADRs would appear in the West was positive.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to feel the market, to set up quotes. For us to have quotes in the West is of major importance,&quot; he said, adding that Inkombank already had underwriters' applications for the whole issue.</p>
