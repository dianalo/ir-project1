<headline>Dlr off highs vs yen after rising on Japan output.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>0624 GMT	    TRADED HIGH/LOW AS OF 0600 GMT</p>
<p> USD/JPY     118.35/45		118.60-118.13</p>
<p> USD/DEM     1.8372/82		1.8378-1.8354</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The dollar was off its highs against the yen by late afternoon Tokyo on Wednesday, after briefly rising on Japan's industrial output data for June.</p>
<p>Output fell a preliminary 3.1 percent month-on-month on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists had forecast on average a fall of 2.8 percent. Forecasts ranged from a fall of 1.2 percent to fall of a 4.0 percent.  </p>
<p>The dollar touched a high of 118.60 yen after the output data was released, with stop-loss buying triggered around 118.55 yen, traders said.</p>
<p>However, the greenback eased quickly on profit taking, they said.</p>
<p>A trust bank trader said operators see the area near 119 yen as a good level to take profits in the near term.</p>
<p>However, traders said they still expect the dollar to eventually test key resistance at 119 yen, which represents the 50-percent retracement of the 1997 high/low between 126.47 and 110.62.  </p>
<p>Japan's industrial output data was encouraging for dollar bulls focusing on the discrepancy between the economic growth of Japan and the United States, a trader at a city bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, people are looking at the strength of the U.S. economy and are being encouraged to buy dollars,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, worries about the U.S.-Japan trade friction might resurface if the greenback continues to rise towards 120 yen, traders said.</p>
<p>Makoto Utsumi, a former Japanese vice finance minister, said on Tuesday that a range of 110 to 120 yen to the dollar is not a problem but a yen weaker than 125 yen would be excessive.  </p>
<p>Traders expect Japanese financial authorities to start talking down the dollar if it rises above 120 yen as such a level could fuel concerns about the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance.</p>
<p>&quot;Japan's financial authorities have been quiet despite the recent rise in the dollar versus the yen, but market participants are becoming more cautious about possible comments from them,&quot; said a trader at another city bank.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Tuesday that the current yen exchange rate is moving within normal market fluctuations. He added that one should not overly emphasise temporary market moves.  </p>
<p>Traders said dollar selling by Japanese exporters was not so aggressive.</p>
<p>&quot;Exporters appeared quite relaxed, seeing no urgent need to sell dollars aggressively now,&quot; said a trust bank trader.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Australian dollar fell after an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), but recovered later on short covering and talk of buying by a Chinese bank.</p>
<p>The RBA said on Wednesday that it had cut its official cash rate by 50 basis points to 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>The Aussie stood at around $0.7470/75 at 0725 GMT after falling as low as around $0.7395 in early trade.  </p>
<p>Singapore dealers said the dollar was taking a breather against the mark but it had remained well supported around 1.8250 marks and was likely to head higher after some consolidation.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's poised to retest 1.85 marks again and in the longer term, it should go up to 1.92,&quot; said a European bank dealer in Singapore.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 118.35/40 yen and 1.8375/85 marks in New York on Tuesday.</p>
