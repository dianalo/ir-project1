<title>USA: Fund selling keeps CSCE coffee under pressure.</title>

<p>CSCE coffee prices lingered at lower levels in early afternoon, as steady profit-taking on the part of commodity funds kept the market under pressure, dealers said.</p>
<p>Speculators focused on liquidating long positions for the second straight day amid views the market's recent rally had been a bit exxagerated.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to get some rounds of profit-taking now and then,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Fund selling was reportedly steady on the most-active July and September positions, though scattered scale-down trade buying at the lows helped stem the losses.</p>
<p>With many operators sidelined by the Speciality Coffee Association's annual meeting in New Orleans, however, the commercial sector was largely quiet.</p>
<p>At 1239 EDT, July futures were down 3.65 cents a lb, to 190.40, having traded from 188.25 to 193.</p>
<p>Spot March, which went into its month-long notice period today, was 1.65 cent lower, to 213.25, as speculators rolled shorts forward to avoid taking delivery. As expected, no notices were posted against the May contract overnight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders continued to monitor news from Colombia, where truckers have been on strike since late Saturday. Earlier Tuesday, the leader of the main truckers' union said he did not expect any resolution to the work stoppage before the weekend.</p>
<p>Volume on the exchange was muted, reaching an estimated 3,616 lots as of 1200 EDT.</p>
