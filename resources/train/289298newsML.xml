<p>Apple Computer Inc. stock dropped sharply Monday  as investors reacted to its statement Friday that weak demand for its Performa line of personal computers will lead to an operating loss of $100 million to $150 million in its latest quarter.</p>
<p>The stock dropped $3.75 to $18 in morning trading on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Apple on Friday blamed a shortage of PowerBook laptop computers and slow sales of its Performa line -- which is geared toward home users -- for the expected shortfall in its first quarter, which ended last month. Consumer sales traditionally account for 40 percent of Apple's Christmas quarter.</p>
<p>Apple said revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 27 will be about 10 percent less than the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter, when Apple surprised Wall Street with a profit of $25 million, or 48 cents a share.</p>
<p>In the year-ago first quarter, the company had revenue of $3.2 billion and reported an operating loss of $119 million. The company had a net loss of $69 million, or 56 cents per share.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts lowered their ratings and earnings estimates for the Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. cut its raing for Apple from hold to unattractive. Prudential Securities lowered its recommendation to hold from buy, according to a source at the brokerage house.</p>
<p>Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio was expected to outline his company's turnaround strategy Tuesday to thousands of Macintosh customers and programmers at the Macworld trade show.</p>
<p>Amelio said Friday the company would have to reduce its expenses by about $1 billion to $8 billion annually to return to profit. That could include another round of firings after the company laid off about 1,300 people last year.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said Saturday that Friday's announcement marked a serious setback to the company's continuing comeback plan.</p>
<p>Apple had been banking on a strong Christmas season to convince potential customers there are still plenty of people using the Macintosh and developers willing to write software for it, analysts said.</p>
<p>The company also had hoped to show software developers there would be enough demand for their products while Apple engineers finish a major overhaul of the Mac's fundamental software with the help of recently acquired Next Software Inc.</p>
<p>But the loss shows Apple is having a much tougher time selling its PC than analysts expected.</p>
<p>In the September quarter, Apple's share of the worldwide PC market fell to 5.4 percent from 8.7 percent in the same quarter a year ago, according to a recent Apple filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the United States, its share fell to 7.3 percent from 13.2 percent.</p>
<p>Apple faces more technological competition from PCs based on Intel Corp. Pentium microprocessors. In a few weeks, Intel will release a new Pentium computer chip with so-called MMX technology that can handle computer graphics and sound much better than before.</p>
