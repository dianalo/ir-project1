<p>The White House said on Monday it saw no reason why the U.S. economy's nearly six-year expansion should not continue, with the country well-placed to enjoy continued low unemployment as well as low inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no forseeable reason why this expansion cannot continue,&quot; said the annual &quot;Economic Report of the President&quot; prepared by President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).</p>
<p>&quot;Most recent expansions have ended because of rising inflation, financial imbalances or inventory overhangs,&quot; the report added. &quot;None of these conditions exists at present.&quot;  </p>
<p>The report said household finances are sound, business inventories are lean and inflation remains under control, adding &quot;the ability of the economy to sustain low unemployment and low inflation is the best it has been in years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The rate of inflation in 1996 has been elevated by rapid increases in food and energy prices,&quot; the CEA added. &quot;These prices are not expected to grow any faster than other prices over the next year, and so the rate of increase in the CPI is expected to edge lower.&quot;</p>
