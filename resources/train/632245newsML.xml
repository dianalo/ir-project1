<headline>China T-note makes poor debut, upstaged by stocks.</headline>

<p>China's newest three-year treasury note made a poor debut on the Shanghai spot debt market on Monday, with the price falling back to face value as speculative money continued to flow into shares, analysts said.</p>
<p>The poor performance reflects continued weak demand on China's spot state debt market, which has been on a downward trend over the past few months as liquidity keeps flowing into the stock markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The T-note, maturing in May 2000, opened at a price of 98.00 yuan ($11.82) against a face value of 100 yuan, hitting an intraday low of 97.49 and a high of 98.20 before closing at 97.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Traders said the note sold slowly during its issue in May mainly due to a low coupon of 9.18 percent compared with an average yield of more than 10 percent for existing spot state debt contracts on the Shanghai bourse.</p>
<p>A total of 40 billion yuan worth of the three-year tradable treasury note was issued in May. By the end of its issue period on May 31, underwriters in Shanghai had sold less than 60 percent of the new bonds, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The weak debut was expected due to the slow sales during the issue,&quot; said one state debt trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The low coupon of the new note, compared with high yields of the former contracts, could only be offset by a price below 98 yuan.&quot;</p>
<p>A second trader said the weak demand indicated a lack of liquidity on the spot state debt market.</p>
<p>&quot;The booming stock markets and many new (domestic) A share issues will continue to suck money out of the spot market, depressing prices of the state debt contracts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>So far this year, A shares with a total face value of around five billion yuan have been issued by nearly 100 firms in China on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges.</p>
<p>The domestic currency A share index on the Shanghai stock exchange has risen around 40 percent so far this year and on the Shenzhen bourse 30 percent, drawing liquidity from the state debt market.</p>
<p>After the low-key debut on Monday, the yield of the new note had been raised to more than 10 percent and potential for further price falls are seen limited, traders said. The note was likely to move around the current level in the short term.</p>
<p>But the lacklustre debut has hit market sentiment on both the state debt primary or issue market and the secondary or public trading spot state debt market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The poor sales and weak debut of the new three-year note will have a great negative impact on the state debt markets,&quot; said one investment analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;The enthusiasm of underwriters and the public has been hurt, so this will be a difficult year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China plans to issue a record 248.596 billion yuan in state debt in 1997 mainly to cover state deficits and redeem maturing state debt.</p>
<p>So far, 20 billion yuan in tradable two-year T-notes and 40 billion yuan in tradable three-year notes have been issued.</p>
<p>Another 123 billion yuan in two-, three- and five-year non-tradable notes are being issued from March 1 to October 20.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected Beijing to take measures to support the declining state debt markets, possibly by lowering bank interest rates or cutting bank reserve ratios.</p>
