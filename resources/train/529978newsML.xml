<p>Japan's scandal-tainted brokerage Nomura Securities Co Ltd announced on Tuesday that president Masashi Suzuki will resign on May 1 and will be replaced by managing director Junichi Ujiie.  </p>
<p>Nomura said in a statement that 15 company board members, including five vice presidents and four senior managing directors who currently have voting rights on matters of company policy, will also resign on April 30 and become company advisers.</p>
<p>Suzuki will retain his chairmanship but lose his voting rights after resigning as president, it said.</p>
<p>He took the post as president of the nation's biggest brokerage only last month after his predecessor, Hideo Sakamaki, stepped down to take responsibility for a scandal linking the firm with a racketeer.</p>
<p>Japan's securities industry suffered a major setback last month when Nomura said two of its directors were involved in suspected illegal deals, in which substantial sums of Nomura money were moved to the account of a corporate customer who was linked to a &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer.</p>
<p>Sokaiya extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt shareholders' meetings.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Sakamaki confirmed before a parliamentary committee that the brokerage had paid more than 70 million yen via stock deals into accounts linked to the racketeer.</p>
