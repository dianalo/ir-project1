<p>The Polish government is likely to discuss next week a new, more liberal banking law which would introduce European Union standards to the sector, Karol Szwarc, a deputy finance minister, said on Monday.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview that under the draft the upper limit of a bank's credit exposure to a single company would be raised to 25 percent of the bank's own assets from the current 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The draft...likely to be discussed by the government next week... introduces changes adjusting Polish law to European Union standards, and opens up the market,&quot; said Szwarc.</p>
<p>He added the draft would probably envisage more stringent rules on the acquisition of shares in banks by introducing a requirement for a central bank permission on a purchase of stock giving more than five percent of votes.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland's permission is now required to execute more than 10 percent of votes.</p>
<p>Szwarc added that under the draft the central bank's Banking Supervision department would be subordinated to a Banking Supervision Committee.</p>
<p>The General Banking Supervision Inspectorate (GINB), now a central bank agency which executes all controlling and monitoring functions over the banking sector, would carry on as an executive arm of the supervision committee.</p>
<p>The committee would be chaired by the NBP's president and would include representatives of the NBP, the finance ministry, the Presidential Chancellery, the Securities Commission and the Banking Guarantee Fund.</p>
<p>Szwarc said the arrangement was a result of a compromise between the government, which wanted to carve out banking supervision from the central bank to form an independent agency and the NBP which to keep supervision within its structure.</p>
