<title>USA: Cold Metal says estimates &quot;conservative&quot;.</title>
<headline>Cold Metal says estimates &quot;conservative&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>PITTSBURGH 1997-07-31</dateline>

<p>Wall Street's consensus estimate of $0.05 per share for Cold Metal Products Inc's fiscal second quarter is &quot;very conservative,&quot; the company's chief executive officer said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that's very conservative,&quot; James Harpster told Reuters in a phone interview. &quot;It's likely undershooting but time will tell...we're working real hard to beat that.&quot;</p>
<p>The company's fiscal second quarter ends September 30.  </p>
<p>Harpster said Wall Street's consensus estimate of $0.45 per share for fiscal year '98 is also &quot;very conservative.&quot;</p>
<p>Cold Metal Products earned $0.14 per share in last year's fiscal second quarter and $0.47 per share in fiscal '97.</p>
<p>Harpster said earnings have been dampened recently by start-up delays at the company's new rolling mill in Ottawa, Ohio.  He said many of the problems causing those delays have been eradicated and the plant's production levels have been steadily increasing.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're convinced we've built the low cost, high quality facility we set out to build,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cold Metal Products, based in Youngstown, Ohio, is one of the country's largest intermediate steel processors.  The company operates nine plants and performs a number of processing services including cold-rolling, slitting and annealing.</p>
