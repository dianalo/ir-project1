<p>Indonesia's central bank is working to make the country's banking sector more competitive and is aware of some problems in the industry, bank governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview the bank felt it could only manage the economy successfully if the banking industry was flourishing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are becoming true believers right now that sustainable macroeconomic monetary management is only possible if we have a healthy banking industry,&quot; Djiwandono said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the end, the banking industry is the agent for implementing our policy on monetary management, on the exchange rate, on the payments system.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, the World Bank said in a report that Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank, should bring about stronger enforcement of existing regulations, provide a well-defined threshold for intervention to help weak banks and accelerate the implementation of its new payments system.</p>
<p>&quot;The suggestions are not outside the things we have been doing. We have been doing most of them, if not all,&quot; Djiwandono said. He noted that one of the measures BI had adopted was to increase capital adequacy requirements for commercial banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of them will not be able to fulfil their requirements and hopefully this kind of climate will give some impact for the market to do something, either by being bought by bigger banks, being merged or acquisitions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is to make them healthy and create a climate, by making more demanding requirements, that give them more stimulus to merge,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said plans to merge the country's seven state banks into a smaller number, which was approved by President Suharto on Friday, would also be beneficial.</p>
<p>Djiwandono said keeping inflation in check remained one of the bank's main priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;We always put inflation as enemy number one,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He reiterated that the central bank was aiming to keep annual inflation below five percent, compared with its latest forecast for 6.0 percent in fiscal 1997/98 (April-March).</p>
<p>&quot;If we deal with inflation and we have a smaller and smaller inflation rate, then we can deal with interest rates and also with exchange rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The second goal of BI's monetary management was keeping the current account deficit and its financing sustainable, he said.</p>
<p>Indonesia posted a current account deficit of $8.823 billion in 1996/97 and the World Bank has forecast it could rise to $10.1 billion in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Djiwandono also noted that a phased depreciation of the rupiah -- of about three to five percent per year -- would help the country's exports, although maintaining this level was sometimes difficult because of high capital inflows.</p>
<p>&quot;But I am not a true believer in using the exchange rate exclusively for defending our competitiveness,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to come from the real sector itself, from efficiency, productivity. The exchange rate is not a player it's like a cheerleader.&quot;</p>
