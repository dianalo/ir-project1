<p>A major conference which opens in London on Wednesday to review the year-old Bosnian peace process looks set to criticise the country's various ethnic communities for not sticking to the terms of the Dayton peace deal.</p>
<p>The two-day Peace Implementation Conference, grouping more than 50 national delegations as well as representatives from major aid agencies, will discuss ways of rebuilding the ravaged country one year after the Dayton deal was signed.</p>
<p>British officials say the Bosnian Moslems, Serbs and Croats are violating Dayton by hampering freedom of movement, preventing refugees from returning home, committing human rights abuses and refusing to hand over indicted war criminals.</p>
<p>The officials said the most effective sanction was to withhold promised aid to those Bosnian ethnic communities which failed to respect Dayton.</p>
<p>&quot;The involvement of the international community and its agencies in different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be conditional on the response of those different parts to the implementation of Dayton,&quot; one senior official told a briefing.</p>
<p>But diplomats concede they can do little to help the parts of the population ruled by leaders who decide to ignore the mounting pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little the international community can do, apart from biding its time and waiting for people to choose leaders bent on progress and not personal gains,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;Paradoxically, many of the leaders in question are afraid of opening up to the West. They prefer poverty in which they can exercise stricter control,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials say the Bosnian Serbs have complained about receiving just two percent of the millions of dollars in aid which has reached Bosnia.</p>
<p>But it was the Bosnian Serb leadership which decided to boycott an international donors' conference in Brussels last April where they could have argued their case for a share of the $1.8 billion in aid earmarked for Bosnia there.</p>
<p>The same leaders, publicly rooting to split Bosnia along ethnic lines, played a game of brinksmanship for weeks before the country's three-man presidency was finally constituted.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serbs have evicted dozens of Moslem families from northwest Bosnia over the past two months, the United Nations reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Diplomats say the Croats and the Moslems are dragging their feet over the creation of joint institutions.</p>
<p>Matters were not helped when nationalist parties and leaders from all three sides were elected in a September poll.</p>
<p>The next elections are scheduled for 1998 and the West is hoping that an economic revival and freer movement of people, goods and money will bring about a rapprochement.</p>
<p>&quot;It's political, moral and economic pressure over the years that's going to have an effect, but I think it needs time,&quot; a British official said.</p>
