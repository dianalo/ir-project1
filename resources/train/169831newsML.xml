<title>USA: 'God Tax' soundly defeated in Colorado.</title>
<headline>'God Tax' soundly defeated in Colorado.</headline>

<p>Colorado churches, synogogues, mosques and other non-profit organizations will keep their tax exempt status following the resounding defeat of Amendment 11, dubbed the 'God Tax,' election results show.</p>
<p>Colorado voters rejected the measure by a strong 83 to 17 percent margin.</p>
<p>Churches and non profits campaigned heavily against the measure and signs saying &quot;No on 11&quot; could be seen planted on church lawns.</p>
<p>Proponents of the measure, which would allowed churches to maintain their status if they engaged in certain work such as teaching or providing meals or shelter to the homeless, , said non-profits benefited from things like fire and police protection and needed to help pay for those services.</p>
<p>But voters feared government services would have to be increased to make up for the work that non-profits might no longer have been able to provide. The slogan &quot;Don't hurt the helpers&quot; apparently persuaded voters agains the measure.</p>
<p>Also, under Colorado's complex tax laws residential property taxes would probably not have been lowered if the measure had been approved, opponents argued. Current law provides for a ratio between residential and non-residential tax revenues. If non-profits paid taxes, businesses might have gotten the tax break.</p>
