<p>Leaders of the ruling African National Congress sought to persuade South Africa's truth commission this week their war against apartheid was just and honourable, but questions remain about the party's dark side.</p>
<p>The commission, chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, on Tuesday wrapped up two days of questioning of a high-level ANC delegation led by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki who tried, in his words, to &quot;contextualise&quot; the party's 30-year armed struggle.</p>
<p>The commission, charged with uncovering human rights abuses, focused on ANC ill-treatment of dissidents and spies in camps in exile and on the ANC's role in political violence in South Africa after it was legalised in 1990.</p>
<p>Mbeki apologised to civilian victims of guerrilla attacks and to party members who were mistreated in ANC camps, but refused to accept any blame for a decade of feuding with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party in which about 15,000 people were killed.</p>
<p>&quot;Organised gangs were responsible for this violence,&quot; Mbeki said. &quot;I don't think you had an original problem of intolerance.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the violence had been stoked by a network of police, magistrates, white right-wingers and Zulu &quot;warlords&quot; as part of a plan by the apartheid government to undermine the ANC and make sure the party and Inkatha never forged an alliance.</p>
<p>Mbeki said the ANC had never regarded Inkatha or Buthelezi as military targets, but members of the commission cited ANC magazine articles from the 1980s that appeared to contradict this view.</p>
<p>Mbeki dismissed the articles -- which described Inkatha as an enemy and urged the death of all enemies -- as empty rhetoric.</p>
<p>But he admitted that an ANC unit had once suggested assassinating Buthelezi and said party members had also wanted to blow up a public building in KwaZulu-Natal province used by Inkatha. ANC leaders had vetoed such ideas, Mbeki said.</p>
<p>His fellow-delegate Mathews Phosa dismissed as superficial the analysis that violence in the province pitted the ANC against Inkatha, saying it was really the ANC versus the former white government.</p>
<p>Commission members raised the issue of necklacing -- the placing of burning tyres are the necks of blacks accused of collaborating with the apartheid government -- and asked how the ANC could reconcile this with its assertion that it conducted a just war.</p>
<p>The ANC delegation said the practice was probably started by police agents in the 1980s but acknowledged that party leaders, most still in exile at the time, had been slow to condemn it.</p>
<p>The commission asked the delegation about self-defence units (SDU), groups of armed youths loyal to the ANC which mushroomed in black townships around Johannesburg in the lead-up to the 1994 election and were heavily involved in violence.</p>
<p>Mbeki agreed that &quot;things began to go wrong&quot; with some of the SDUs, but said no one could have foreseen that this would happen.</p>
<p>&quot;The same questions are being put to the previous government,&quot; commissioner Wynand Malan said. &quot;Should this not have been foreseen? Wasn't the party guilty by omission?&quot;</p>
<p>Mbeki said the ANC had always observed humanitarian principles in its conduct of guerrilla war, refusing to entertain suggestions that white civilians should be targetted.</p>
<p>&quot;There were many instances when people said, 'When are we going to abandon this policy? Because you have white schoolchildren who travel in a bus to go to a white school. It's an easy target...why don't we just hit these things? Let the white population feel this pain.'</p>
<p>&quot;Any number of times these things would come up and we would say: No, No, No, because it is wrong,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
<p>Tutu praised the ANC at the end of the hearing for its openness, saying such an attitude would help achieve the reconciliation which the commission was working for.</p>
