<p>Sri Lanka's state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has shut down the island's only 55,000-barrel per day refinery due to insufficient crude, a senior company official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The refinery was shut down on May 30. It will remain closed till June 8 or 9,&quot; the official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The unscheduled shutdown was due to insufficient crude to run the refinery after the CPC's single point mooring buoy (SPMB), which discharges crude from tankers to the refinery, was damaged in an accident last month.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to have the SPMB repaired by about June 8 and the refinery running shortly after that,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Two tankers carrying 85,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes of crude, will remain outside the Colombo port till the SPMB is ready, he said.</p>
<p>The official added that CPC had advanced its regular imports of refined products to ensure there were no shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;We have advanced shipment of some of our regular refined products imports. So there will be no shortage in the market during this time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>CPC officials said smaller tankers could discharge refined products at a new oil berth opened last month, which is capable of handling ships of up to 40,000 tonnes.</p>
