<title>UK: NWE naphtha falls with crude oil, Med looks east.</title>

<p>NWE naphtha prices ended modestly lower on Friday after a late selloff in crude futures and a pair of weaker cargo deals on Thursday.</p>
<p>But traders said the Med was still a bit tighter with interest in shipping more cargoes to the Far East.</p>
<p>May swaps fell $3.50 to $177/$178 with June at $180/$181 and July at $180.50/$181.50, traders said.</p>
<p>NWE cargoes were notionally assessed at $175/$178 cif with one trader offering 20,000-25,000 tonnes of pipeline spec material at $178 cif, with flexible delivery.</p>
<p>The two deals done yesterday were now believed to have been done at $175.75 for 10-20,000 tonnes pipeline spec with 70 paraffins minimum for first half May shipping, and another at $179 for 25,000 tonnes of the same type of material and same shipping, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a bit of buying interest from the Far East,&quot; for Med material, one source said. &quot;The arb is not working for single stem but for double-stem it is definitely working...the problem is finding two stems.&quot;</p>
<p>He also said that in NWE there was not any extraordinary demand for heavier naphthenic and aromatic (N+A) material to make gasoline. Oil companies were producing enough to meet their needs, he said.</p>
<p>That is somewhat contrary to other market opinions that strength in gasoline, barring a sharp selloff on Friday, and seasonal factors were boosting demand for N+A.</p>
