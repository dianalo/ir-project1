<p>Japanese stocks rose sharply on Wednesday, as the yen's fall to a fresh 47-month low against the dollar fuelled buying of shares in multinational companies.</p>
<p>The market's key barometer, the Nikkei average of 225 leading shares, jumped by 538.73 points or 3.03 percent to close at 18,335.30. Its March futures rose 580 points to 18,370.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sony hit a new high (for the current financial year) and this triggered further buying in high-tech sectors, such as semiconductors,&quot; said Sueharu Ando, head of the equity trading division at Nikko Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The stock market was also supported by figures for industrial production, released on Wednesday, which showed output on a rising trend, brokers said. The market has been battered recently by fears that the Japanese economy may worsen in the coming months.</p>
<p>But brokers also noted underlying fears that foreign investors may sell stocks and that Japanese companies may try to cash in profits on stocks in February before they close their accounts for the financial year in March.</p>
<p>A weaker yen can help exporters by making their products more competitive overseas but can also encourage foreign investors to dump Japanese stocks as their value dwindles in dollar terms. The dollar rose to a fresh 47-month high above 122 yen in Tokyo trade on Wednesday on a growing belief that key financial authorities will not block its advance.</p>
