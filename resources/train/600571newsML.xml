<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, expects rising world oil demand to keep crude prices buoyant for the remainder of the year, a Gulf source said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The source, familiar with oil policy in the kingdom, said Saudi expectations for demand on Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries crude this year had been revised higher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia now saw demand on OPEC at around 27 million barrels a day (bpd) on average this year compared to a previous projection of 26.3 million bpd made at the end of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The call on OPEC will be about 27 million bpd or possibly a little more,&quot; the Gulf source said.</p>
<p>Whereas world demand looked set to rise by some two million bpd this year extra supplies in 1997 from non-OPEC nations would reach only one million bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have what most people see as 27 million bpd from OPEC and no more than an extra one million coming from non-OPEC then the market will continue balanced to tight,&quot; the Gulf source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is taking 27 million from OPEC and there is not an excessive stock overhang. We are at the end of the second quarter without the bad overhang some had predicted.&quot;</p>
<p>Oil prices, now at $20.10 a barrel for benchmark Brent blend, have subsided from last year's six-year high of $26 but remain within the range predicted by Gulf oil producers at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The price is going to hold at this level,&quot; the Gulf source predicted.</p>
<p>Brent jumped to $20.30 last year and has maintained that level so far in 1997, recording a $3 rise from the $17 averaged in four years to the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading light, pumps some eight million barrels of oil daily and exports twice as much as its nearest competitor Norway.</p>
<p>The Saudis were alone among oil price pundits in correctly predicting last year's rally.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia would stick by its official output quota of eight million bpd despite the widespread quota busting which has carried combined OPEC crude flow some two million in excess of its official 25.03 million barrel a day (bpd) ceiling, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;We like to maintain our reputation for sticking by agreements,&quot; said the source.</p>
<p>OPEC's eleven members have increased production by about a million bpd since November of last year, reaching 27.05 million bpd in April, according to Reuters' surveys.</p>
<p>Iraq, pumping 1.32 million in April, has raised supplies by 700,000 bpd under a U.N. oil-for-food exchange.</p>
<p>But other OPEC members, ignoring official quotas and helped by foreign investment, are pumping increasing volumes.</p>
<p>The Gulf source said an extra 400,000 bpd of output from OPEC might be forthcoming in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are more worried about the possibility of an extra 400,000 bpd from OPEC than what non-OPEC will do,&quot; said the Gulf source.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, Venezuela and Indonesia might all add production capacity this year.</p>
<p>&quot;If production capacity increases and they use it, it could present some uncertainty in the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>OPEC is expected to leave unchanged official quotas under its 25.03 million ceiling when it meets in Vienna in June.</p>
<p>Several OPEC ministers, including Libya's OPEC President Abdalla el-Badri said they favour a freeze on quotas.</p>
<p>The Gulf source said a rollover of the ceiling was &quot;a possibility.&quot;</p>
