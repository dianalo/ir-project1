<text>
<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady-$0.50 per cwt higher, underpinned by outlooks for continued light hog movement, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Lighter-than-expected interior Indiana and southern Minnesota hog movement Friday forced packers to raise bids early Monday as they sought slaughter inventories.</p>
<p>The marketings were light enough to offset reduced demand from the suspension this week of second shift operations at John Morrell and Co.'s hog plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., the dealers said.  </p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog receipts Friday totalled 100,000 head compared with the estimate of 105,000, and receipts Saturday were 8,000 compared with the estimate of 15,000, USDA reported.</p>
<p>Monday's receipts were estimated at 100,000 head.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant on Tuesday were seen $56.00 to $56.50. Illinois hogs at the plant were seen $55.00 to $55.50.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs shipped to the plant could range $56.00 to $56.50.</p>
