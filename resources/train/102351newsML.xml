<p>Grupo Mexico, the country's largest copper producer, is mulling what to do with the often-overlooked output of its highly prized and highly priced zinc concentrates, analysts and company sources said.</p>
<p>Grupo Mexico, widely known as GMexico, is producing more zinc mineral tonnes every year but must farm out the majority of the refining to metal producing competitors, such as to Mexican silver giant Industrias Penoles SA because its own refining capacity is limited.  </p>
<p>Analysts are sure the company will eventually move to boost refining capacity at GMexico's in-house electrolytic zinc refinery outside central city of San Luis Potosi.</p>
<p>&quot;We have too much concentrate production,&quot; admits Deputy Finance Director Carlos Oyanguren.</p>
<p>&quot;That (boosting refinery capacity) is one of those logical projects that might come after our plans that are in the pipeline are complete,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Oyanguren is quick to fend off questions of how, when, where and what capacity. &quot;It has not been authorised, it is not known where and capacities are not known either,&quot; Oyanguren said in a recent interview.  </p>
<p>Oyanguren, questioned whether the most logical step would be to expand the San Luis Potosi refinery, and said several options were out there. It also could be positioned near to the company's zinc mines or the border to export refined product to the United States.</p>
<p>GMexico currently produces around 380,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates per year from seven subterranean mines that produce some zinc. Its San Martin unit in Zacatecas state is the biggest underground mine in Mexico, producing two million mineral tonnes per year of zinc, silver, lead and copper.  </p>
<p>Half the zinc concentrate, around 190,000 tonnes, is sent to GMexico's San Luis Potosi refinery and churns out 100,000 tonnes of refined zinc. Part of the remaining 190,000 tonnes is sold to Penoles, but the majority is shipped to the U.S. and Europe to be refined there.</p>
<p>In line wih GMexico's moves to vertically integrate copper output from the mine to pure cathode production, analysts say the company plans to modernise and expand its underground mines and up the percentage of zinc it sells in refined form.</p>
<p>&quot;It has not yet publicly announced how it will proceed in expanding refined zinc production,&quot; said Valores Finamex mining analyst Christopher Albi in a report.  </p>
<p>&quot;We expect, however, the company to make significant investments in zinc. Despite the major copper projects now underway the company foresees the composition of sales, in which zinc makes up about 15 percent of sales, remaining the same in coming years,&quot; Albi added.</p>
<p>Not losing sight of the prospects of zinc looks like sound policy given the worldwide expectation for upward trending zinc prices in the future as mine production continues to outstrip refinery capacity.  </p>
<p>Tariq Salaria, analyst for Metal Bulletin Research, said at this week's London Metal Exchange (LME) seminar that zinc prices are expected to reach 60 cents a lb ($1,320/tonne) by the end of the year as stocks fall towards critically low levels. LME three-month zinc is trading $1023-1029 this week.</p>
<p>But other analysts say GMexico's zinc plans could hinge on what the company decides to do with its copper-gold mine El Arco in Baja California state. &quot;It's a huge project and could shape the company for the next few years,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>It is a project that could need investment of up to $1 billion depending on how GMexico decides to develop the mine, which hinges on the outcome of the final mine study due next month, Oyanguren said.</p>
