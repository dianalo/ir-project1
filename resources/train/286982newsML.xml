<p>The Venezuelan government said on Saturday it was considering declaring a national state of health emergency to deal with an eight-day public doctors' strike over pay.</p>
<p>The administration of President Rafael Caldera, facing its worst crisis in a public health system notoriously underfunded and poorly supplied, appointed a special ministerial team to try and solve the pay dispute with the country's 25,000 doctors.</p>
<p>&quot;President Caldera is studying all options and a national emergency is one of them,&quot; a presidential spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The measure would entail a militarization of Venezuela's 380 hospitals and 4,000 ambulance services.</p>
<p>The government has said it will not negotiate with the striking doctors until they returned to work, first at emergency wards nationwide.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff, summing up the government's stance, said on Friday: &quot;You cannot negotiate with people who put a revolver to the poor's heads.&quot;</p>
<p>The government is willing to grant a 25 percent increase in pay, in line with what is being planned for the whole public sector.</p>
<p>Venezuelan doctors, who earn a minimum $126 per month and $304 monthly average including bonuses, demand at least $735, down from an initial $1,000 when the stoppage began on Dec. 27.</p>
<p>Authorities said the strike has led to the deaths of 10 patients, who died for apparent lack of adequate medical treatment, and have threatened legal action.</p>
