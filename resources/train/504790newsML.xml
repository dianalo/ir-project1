<headline>HK democrats use balloons in lofty China protest.</headline>

<p>Pro-democracy activists sent a banner attached to dozens of helium-filled balloons drifting in to China on Saturday to protest against Bejing-backed plans to change in the territory.</p>
<p>About a dozen members of the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature drove into the Lok Ma Chau border area to send off the balloons and banner.</p>
<p>The provisional legislature is the Beijing-annointed body which will replace Hong Kong's existing elected legislature when the territory reverts to Chinese rule in a few months.</p>
<p>The protestors cheered as the banner, which read: &quot;Against the provisional legislature passing laws before July 1&quot;, floated towards the Chinese border city of Shenzhen where a meeting of the China-crafted provisional legislature is being held.</p>
<p>About a dozen policemen looked on but did not interfere as the group confined its protest within public areas.</p>
<p>Beijing will replace Hong Kong's present chamber with the interim legislature on July 1, when Britain hands the territory back to China after more than 150 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp is virulently against the interim chamber and has vowed to sue it if it tried to pass laws before the handover.</p>
<p>Spokesman for the protestors, To Kwan Hang, said the group opted to release the balloons because many of his colleagues were not permitted to travel to China.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government is afraid of hearing Hong Kong voices. So we are doing this to bring our views over to them,&quot; To told reporters.</p>
<p>This is the second time the United Front has launched protests via balloons. Some members of the group were charged by police after they intruded into a restricted border area in December during a similar protest against the interim chamber.</p>
