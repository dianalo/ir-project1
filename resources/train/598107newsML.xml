<p>U.S. manufacturing plants spewed five percent less toxic pollution into the air, land and water in 1995 than in 1994, but left more toxic chemicals in waste, the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Facilities reported 35 billion pounds of toxic chemicals in waste streams in 1995. Of this amount, 15 billion pounds comes from chemicals added to the reporting list since 1991.</p>
<p>In 1991, the total was 19 billion pounds, according to the ninth annual Toxic Release Inventory.</p>
<p>The list is designed to inform communities about pollution in their areas.</p>
<p>EPA had no direct comparisons for waste streams in 1995 versus 1994.</p>
<p>At the same time, underground injections of chemicals rose by 19 percent or by 24 million pounds in 1995 from the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;The report ... shows that generation of toxic chemical wastes by American manufacturers continues to increase. In other words, we still have our work cut out for us,&quot; EPA Administrator Carol Browner said at a news briefing.</p>
<p>Browner said that in some cases the increase in underground injections reflected a shift in chemicals that were previously discharged into the air or water.</p>
<p>&quot;Production-related waste is the best measurement for whether companies are preventing pollution or whether they're just shifting it someplace else,&quot; said Carolyn Hartmann, environmental director of U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</p>
<p>Hartmann called the latest numbers troubling, saying that manufacturers appeared to be controlling smokestacks but moving toxic chemicals elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;The data is just showing us we need to keep ... pushing companies toward pollution prevention,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>EPA said companies expected little change in their waste streams for 1996 and 1997, and excluding chemicals that were added to the inventory in 1995, they expected a slight increase in waste.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are now required to track more than 600 chemicals, including methanol, ammonia, and hydrochloric acid, which are among the 20 chemicals with the largest releases.</p>
<p>The list does not rank the risks associated with the chemicals, a fact that companies say makes the inventory unhelpful and a costly administrative burden.</p>
<p>But the Clinton administration has highlighted the public's right to know about toxic releases as a tool to press plants to clean up their processes beyond federal standards.</p>
<p>It has almost doubled the list of tracked chemicals and expanded the number of industries that must file reports.</p>
<p>Environmentalists are pressing the agency to follow the example of New Jersey and Massachusetts to make manufacturers report the chemicals they use, which green groups and EPA believe would be a better way to track pollution prevention.</p>
