<title>ISRAEL: Thousands at burial of Gazan killed in PLO custody.</title>
<headline>Thousands at burial of Gazan killed in PLO custody.</headline>
<dateline>GAZA 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thousands of Arab mourners chanted slogans against the Palestinian Authority at the funeral on Tuesday of a Gazan who officials said died as a result of a beating by PLO security men while in custody.</p>
<p>Another Palestinian prisoner, Sami Ali Abed Rabbo, died on Monday at a Gaza prison and security forces told his family he suffered a blood clot, a Palestinian human rights group said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 3,000 people, including many uniformed policemen, walked or drove behind the coffin of 28-year-old Nasser Radwan. He died on Monday, a week after he was detained for reasons that are still unclear.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want an Authority of collaborators,&quot; the demonstrators chanted, insinuating that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's self-rule administration was a stooge of Israel.</p>
<p>The militant Moslem group Hamas had urged Gazans to attend the funeral to show their anger at the Palestinian security forces.</p>
<p>Radwan, 28, was the 13th Palestinian to die in custody since the Authority took charge of parts of the West Bank and Gaza in 1994 under a peace deal with Israel signed the previous year. He was arrested by Force 17, an elite unit that guards Arafat.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said it had written the acting Palestinian attorney general demanding an inquiry into Monday's death of the 40-year-old Abed Rabbo.</p>
<p>&quot;The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights expresses concern for the atmosphere of secrecy surrounding the death and the burial of the deceased's body when Palestinian law requires informing an investigative judge,&quot; the centre said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said Abed Rabbo was detained by Palestinian intelligence in February on suspicioun of &quot;helping&quot; Israeli security forces.</p>
<p>No Palestinian officials were immediately available to comment on the report.</p>
<p>The Authority has detained 10 police officers, including a colonel, and accused eight of them of causing Radwan's death and &quot;inciting the masses against the Palestinian National Authority&quot;.</p>
<p>Eight detainees are on trial in a military court in Gaza City and officials said they faced the death penalty.</p>
<p>Radwan's death ignited a debate among Palestinians about police abuses.</p>
<p>&quot;Autopsy reports show paralysis in the left side of his body and in the left arm and leg. An unknown substance came from his mouth,&quot; LAW, The Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;His left arm and leg were also fractured and showed signs of having been bound by wire. His head and beard had been shaved,&quot; the Jerusalem-based group said.</p>
<p>Police chief Ghazi al-Jabali, in a statement published in local Palestinian newspapers, announced the establishment of an office to take complaints from the public.</p>
<p>In a separate announcement, he said that it was forbidden to beat any suspect while in detention or during questioning &quot;under any circumstances&quot;.</p>
<p>The statement said police would &quot;have no mercy&quot; on anyone, regardless of rank, found guilty of assaulting a citizen. It also banned police from accepting &quot;donations&quot; from the public.</p>
