<p>A man was killed and several were hurt in pre-election clashes between supporters of Yemen's ruling General Peoples Congress party and its Islah party coalition partner, the parties and witnesses said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Armed clashes between supporters of the GPC party and the the Islah Party took place late last night (Sunday) and resulted in the killing of one man and the injury of a number of others,&quot; witnesses told Reuters.</p>
<p>They said the fighting broke out in the town of al-Odein in the governorate of Ibb, 190 km (120 miles) south of the capital Sanaa.</p>
<p>Both the GPC and the Islamist Islah said the dead man was a member of their party.</p>
<p>There have been frequent clashes between backers of various parties in the run-up to the April 27 parliamentary elections, but there had been no previous casualties.</p>
<p>Witnesses said al-Odein had been the site of political tension during voter registration last August.</p>
<p>Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, in remarks published on Monday, repeated his call for a peaceful election and urged a high voter turnout in the polls, the first in the poor Arab country since a civil war in 1994 nearly tore it apart.</p>
<p>&quot;Exercise your right to vote but stay away from violence,&quot; Saleh said in an interview published in the official al-Thawra newspaper. Saleh called the violence unacceptable but did not refer to any specific incidents.</p>
<p>Saleh also called on the government to ensure parties did not use mosques as campaigning grounds, a clear swipe at the Islah party.</p>
<p>The main opposition Yemen Socialist Party and four others have announced they would boycott the polls because of alleged irregularities.</p>
<p>Some 4.6 million of the 7.5 million people aged 18 and over who are eligible to vote out of a population of 16 million have registered to vote.</p>
