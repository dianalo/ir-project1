<title>FRANCE: No EU decision on France Telecom - finance ministry.</title>
<headline>No EU decision on France Telecom - finance ministry.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-10-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French finance ministry official said on Tuesday no decision had been taken either at the level of the European Commission or any EU working group on whether a transfer of 37.5 billion francs from France Telecom to French government finances was acceptable.</p>
<p>&quot;The (European) Commission has denied it and we can confirm that no decision was taken either by the Commission or any working group,&quot; a finance ministry official told Reuters.  </p>
<p>At issue is whether the transfer of money to cover future pension liabilities at the state telecoms operator can be used by the French government in its accounting to reduce its public deficit next year to meet the Maastricht treaty criteria for European monetary union.</p>
<p>Separately, a source at the European Commission in Brussels said a number of committees had discussed the issue recently but no consensus had emerged and that EU member states had now been asked to provide a written opinion on the transfer.</p>
<p>The denials came in response to a news agency report which said the transfer had been rejected by an EU working group.  </p>
<p>The source said EU member states had been asked to report back by midday (1100 GMT) on Wednesday and the information would be presented to Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who would probably announce a decision next week.</p>
<p>The French franc lost more than half a centime, hitting 3.3869 versus the German mark, down from 3.3810 at the time when the news agency report was published. But it then regained some ground to 3.3833 by 1738 GMT.</p>
<p>France has said it will cut its public deficit next year to meet the Maastricht criteria, which call for deficits to be limited to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
