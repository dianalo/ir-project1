<p>COFFEE: World market for October 29, 1996</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London stayed mixed up to the close as Asian origin and speculative selling countered roaster buying at the lows. November finished down $2.00 at $1,522 while second month January was $1.00 up at $1,400 a tonne. The November/January spread, a barometer of nearby supply availability, narrowed slightly to end at $122 down from Monday's $130 finish.</p>
<p>In New York arabica futures opened sharply higher with December leading the way. The rapid rise was in response to the depletion of CSCE stocks, traders said. However, selling pressure emerged and the market showed the first signs of toppy behaviour.</p>
<p>But nearby supplies will remain tight and sources indicate that coffee is not likely to start appearing in significant quantities in the United States for another two months with most of the new crop coffee being outbid by European roasters. Hence further sharp declines are unlikely.</p>
<p>December lost 2.75 cents/lb to close at 116.35 cents/lb, while March gave up 85 points to close at 105.00 cents/lb. The outer months lost between 0.50 to 1.40 cents/lb.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>BRAZIL - A new Brazilian policy-making coffee council will work to increase Brazil's coffee crop to an average of 30 to 35 million 60-kg bags in the next ten years, the Industry and Commerce Minister said. Green coffee production in 1996/97 is estimated at between 25 and 27 million bags and first indications are that production will fall in 1997/98.</p>
<p>The council aims to boost output by creating better credit lines for farmers and looking at ways to boost productivity to an average 15 to 20 bags per ha, it was said. The new council is made up of six representatives each from the private and the public sector. Previously Brazilian coffee policy has been decided by discussions between the government and an informal private sector umbrella group.</p>
<p>TANZANIA - According to official sources coffee production in Tanzania in 1994/95 (July/June) reached 725,000 60-kg bags and rose to 866,000 bags the following year. However, production in 1996/97 is forecast to fall to 700,000 bags.</p>
<p>FINLAND - Finland imported 145,573 bags of coffee in June 1996, sharply up on the 65,165 bags imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports since the beginning of 1996 up to 524,300 bags, 37 per cent more than was imported the same period in 1995. Total imports in calendar year 1995 dropped sharply by 44 per cent to 758,500 bags.</p>
<p>Main suppliers of green coffee in January/June 1996 were Costa Rica (71,500 vs 59,500 bags), Guatemala (88,700 vs 49,100 bags), Brazil (66,300 vs 68,000 bags) and Colombia (130,400 vs 99,600 bags).</p>
<p>The country exported 64,200 bags of coffee in January/June 1996, 52 per cent more than was exported the same period in 1995. Total exports in calendar year 1995 dropped sharply to 96,800 bags from 217,500 bags the previous year.</p>
