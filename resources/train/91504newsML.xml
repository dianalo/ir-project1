<p>Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon said Wednesday the U.N. Law of the Sea convention should be firmly upheld to ensure rival maritime claims were not settled by force.</p>
<p>In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, he said a potential threat to global and regional peace and security had been the &quot;developing scramble for jurisdiction, resources and strategic positions&quot; in the world's oceans.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been prominently evident in the situation in the South China Sea, which for the most part is surrounded by South East Asian states,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Although Siazon did not mention any specific dispute, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have all laid partial or total claim to the Spratly Islands, which are believed to hold rich oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p>In the East China Sea, China and Japan are in dispute over islands called the Diaoyus in Chinese and Senkakus in Japanese.</p>
<p>Siazon said the international community had fortunately agreed on a set of rules governing the use of the sea, primarily the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This was concluded in 1982 and entered into force in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Not least, UNCLOS subjects maritime jurisdictions to the rule of law, defining the nature and limits of those jurisdictions and providing the legal framework for their establishment and for negotiating a settlement where they overlap,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The rule of law, as enshrined principally in UNCLOS, &quot;has to be upheld with determination and vigilance so that the assertion of jurisdiction over the world's seas are governed by law rather than by the use of superior force,&quot; Siazon said.</p>
