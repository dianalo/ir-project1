<p>Germany glowed with pride this weekend after its soldiers opened fire under &quot;hostile conditions&quot; for the first time since World War Two in a spectacular operation to rescue foreigners from Albania.</p>
<p>The operation to get 120 Germans and other citizens out of the troubled Balkan state broke a taboo against active combat, which had held for over half a century because of memories of war-time atrocities committed in Nazi-occupied lands.</p>
<p>Dramatic pictures of Friday's mission were plastered over the front pages of Germany's newspapers as commentators burst with pride at the return to normal military action by the army, which has long been haunted by the country's militaristic past.</p>
<p>&quot;The German heroes from Albania,&quot; read a huge headline across the mass circulation Bild am Sonntag front page.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last few years I've always asked why do we actually need a German army? Today I am happy that we have one,&quot; one of the evacuees, Manuela Margjini, told the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a historical point in the life of unified Germany. The incident shows that the Federal Republic cannot escape from its new political responsibility in international crises,&quot; the Saturday edition of the Bild daily wrote in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;The soldiers' deeds were, without doubt, a huge risk, but also a great success,&quot; wrote the Westdeutsche Allgemeine.</p>
<p>The taboo against active combat has gradually been eroded since unification in 1990 with the deployment of Tornado jets in former Yugoslavia last year and Germany's contribution to the NATO-led peacekeeping SFOR mission in Bosnia this year.</p>
<p>But despite progress toward a normal military role, German troops had never fired shots in the way they did to protect the Western evacuees huddled together on a disused airfield outside Tirana from fire from Albanian gunmen.</p>
<p>One Albanian was lightly wounded in the crossfire and the gunmen hit one of the German helicopters.</p>
<p>Five military helicopters from Bosnia protected by 25 soldiers evacuated 120 people, mostly Germans and citizens of other European Union states, and took them to Montenegro on Albania's northern border.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said the German army had used guns in Somalia on a United Nations peace-keeping mission in 1993, but this was the first time they had to do so under hostile conditions.</p>
<p>The pilots and troops received a heroes' welcome on their return to their Sarajevo base on Saturday. &quot;It was exciting, of course. I am just happy that all of my 91 soldiers are back and no evacuees were wounded.&quot; said evacuation commander Colonel Henning Glawatz, as he was swamped by well-wishers.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever compares the pictures of uncertain German soldiers in the Gulf War with the brave and level-headed operation of the Grenadiers, knows what Germany and its forces have put behind them,&quot; the Welt am Sonntag newspaper wrote.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe were both bursting with pride as they greeted many of the evacuees who flew from Montenegro to Cologne military airport.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot stand aside if a peace agreement needs to be secured, nor can we rely on the forces of other countries to free our own people from life-threatening situations,&quot; Kinkel told the Welt am Sonntag.</p>
<p>Commentators praised the government for receiving consent from Bonn's main political parties in parliament before ordering the mission. &quot;It is part of the good democratic custom in Bonn to carry questions of life and death together,&quot; said Saturday's edition of the Westdeutsche Allgemeine daily.</p>
<p>But commentators said the mission should not be taken as a green light for future military action. &quot;That is something for parliament to decide and not the generals,&quot; wrote the Bonn Express daily.</p>
