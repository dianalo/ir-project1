<p>Physical copper premiums are holding steady for now, but look set to ease shortly as a high LME backwardation attracts material to a tight market, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Premiums haven't been easing yet, but they will over the next couple of days,&quot; said one London-based physical trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The backwardation bites very hard in the next few days so I would expect more material to be in circulation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The cash to three months backwardation ballooned to a high of $210 last week as technical tightness emerged in late April and early May dates.</p>
<p>The backwardation eased slightly in the LME midday trading session to around $130 amid a flurry of lending. Three months copper also came off the morning's highs above $2,400.</p>
<p>Physical traders said the European merchant market was subdued, with demand dampened by prohibitively high premiums. Although consumption was good, it was covered by long-term contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;The back is killing off any interest as cash above $2,600 is not conducive to developing any extra business,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little bit steep.&quot;</p>
