<p>Following is a selection of economists' reactions to the February PMI index which fell to 53.5 from 53.9 and to money supply and consumer credit data:</p>
<p>JOHN SHEPPERD, YAMAICHI</p>
<p>(PMI) &quot;It's terrific, no problems with this at all. It shows a continuation of expansion in the manufacturing sector and a terrific series on prices. It looks like an extraordinarily good combination.&quot;  </p>
<p>JEREMY HAWKINS, BANK OF AMERICA</p>
<p>&quot;(PMI) Much as expected overall tone, but fall in the price component soft. This should be well received by the UK curve and provides the chancellor with additional ammunition to justify a steady rate stance. Breakdown nonetheless shows a sharp jump in the output index that suggests that the stock adjustment process that has held down output for many months is at or near an end. Exports were reported to be modestly higher in contrast to other more pessimistic anecdotal evidence...The rest of the data are soft. M0 growth fell much more than expected and and consumer credit dipped back below one billion stg.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The credit card component eased to a comparatively weak 141 million. This is in line with a pickup in consumer spending that is not strong enough to accommodate aggressive price hikes. Net, data are good for inflation prospects and point to downward profile to the key RPIX near term. Increasingly small likelihood of any rate change before the election.&quot;  </p>
<p>STEPHEN HANNAH, IBJ (RFTV) &quot;The price data mean interest rates are obviously going to remain steady for the near term. It shows again we're showing broadly similar characteristics to the U.S. economy, that is reasonably strong growth without any pressures on inflation at this particular point of time...We are somewhat above the long-run inflation objective. The size of the increase that we need is not of a draconian nature that we used to see in the 1970s. Fifty to 100 basis points would probably do the trick, ensuring the inflation rate comes down to the 2.5 percent level. There is a bit of a breathing space for the next government.&quot;  </p>
