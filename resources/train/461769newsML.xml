<p>The United States cast its second veto in two weeks on Friday to kill a Security Council resolution demanding that Israel halt work on a controversial new Jewish housing project in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The vote on the draft, sponsored by Egypt and Qatar, was 13 in favour, with the United States casting the lone negative vote and Costa Rica abstaining.</p>
<p>Egypt is the council's only Arab member while Qatar is current chairman of the 22-member Arab group.</p>
<p>On March 7 the United States vetoed a resolution, supported by all 14 other council members, calling on Israel to abandon plans to build 6,500 homes for Jews on land it captured during the 1967 Middle East war. The site, between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, is called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic and Har Homa in Hebrew.</p>
<p>The United States, chief sponsor of Middle East peace negotiations, has joined in world-wide criticism of Israel's action. But it also argued that differences between Israel and the Palestinians should be resolved between them and not brought to the United Nations or other international bodies.</p>
<p>Speaking before casting his latest veto, American U.N. envoy Bill Richardson said: &quot;No one should interpret the opposition of my government to this resolution as an expression of support for the construction now going on at Har Homa/Jabal Abu Ghneim. It is not.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said the United States &quot;does not believe that the Security Council or the General Assembly should be in the business of inserting themselves into issues that the negotiating partners have decided will be addressed in their permanent status talks. Such interference can only harden the position of both sides.&quot;</p>
<p>After the March 7 U.S. veto of a resolution sponsored by the council's four European Union members -- Britain, France, Portugal and Sweden -- Arab states took the issue to the General Assembly, where there is no veto but whose decisions are not binding.</p>
<p>On March 13 the Assembly adopted a resolution by a vote of 130 to 2 with 2 abstentions, calling on Israel not to go ahead with the project. The United States and Israel cast the only negative votes.</p>
<p>When Israeli surveyors and bulldozers began work on the site on Tuesday the Arab group brought the issue back to the Security Council with a new, briefer resolution.</p>
<p>Speaking after the veto, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's U.N. observer, Nasser al-Kidwa, said it was difficult to accept that it had been cast to protect the peace process or that bilateral negotiations were the only solution &quot;when one of the two parties is imposing new facts on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The bitter reality is that this veto has been cast to shield Israel from the will of the international community and to exempt Israel from the provisions of international law and the Charter of the United Nations,&quot; al-Kidwa added.</p>
<p>Israeli U.N. envoy David Peleg said the convening of the Security Council, the General Assembly and other bodies in which Israel was repeatedly lambasted had contributed to an atmosphere &quot;interpreted by terrorist organisations as conducive to operations against Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>Rather than allowing the &quot;blatant misuse of the Security Council,&quot; members should condemn &quot;calls for incitement and holy war&quot; and call on the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table and not regard the United Nations as a substitute for direct talks.</p>
<p>The latest veto was the 72nd cast by the United States. Russia has used its veto 116 times, Britain on 30 occasions, France 18, and China 3.</p>
