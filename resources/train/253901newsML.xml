<p>China continues to import soymeal but January purchases threaten to be slow since anything bought at that time would be delivered during the Lunar New Year lull starting in early February, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;February is the slowest month of the year, with the New Year holiday and workers leaving ports for home,&quot; said one senior grains trader.</p>
<p>Although the 1997 New Year holiday runs from February 7-9, the whole month is traditionally quiet for trade and industry.</p>
<p>But bean and meal deals were still heard this week, sources said, although higher meal prices would likely make Indian meal more attractive with its smaller shipment size, usually about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in January China will mostly buy Indian meal,&quot; said one grains trader.</p>
<p>One China-based industry source said a state-run trading firm had bought 50,000 tonnes of U.S. meal this week for delivery early January 1997, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Rumours China bought 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes of U.S soymeal for January through March shipment helped boost Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soymeal, which closed $2.00 to $4.10 per ton higher, with December up $3.60 at $231.60.</p>
<p>The U.S soybeans bought when prices were lower were now arriving or on their way to Chinese ports, traders in Hong Kong and China said.</p>
<p>Up to four panamax cargoes of U.S. beans were said heading to a variety of Chinese ports, including one to Dalian.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a panamax cargo of U.S. soybeans arriving in Shandong towards the end of December,&quot; one industry source said, noting that payments were not a problem.</p>
<p>A cape-sized cargo (70,000 tonnes) of U.S. beans was heard heading to the northern port of Tianjin, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Despite China's massive meal imports, traders and industry sources said regulations on import duties were still not entirely clear, with one Shanghai-based source noting that importers simply &quot;negotiated&quot; a fee with customs officers.</p>
<p>Worries that China may slap import restrictions on beans were still teasing the market.</p>
<p>&quot;China really needs to keep its feed meal prices down,&quot; said one soybean expert, noting that higher meal prices would drive up pork and poultry prices which could in turn boost inflation.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, one U.S soybean cargo was heard sold recently for delivery in early January, although the seller anticipated &quot;problems&quot; with the contract.</p>
<p>About 50,000 tonnes of Indian meal was heard sold to China for delivery in late December or early January.</p>
<p>The meal was sold at about $305 per tonne, C&amp;F China, one industry source said.</p>
<p>A 10,000-tonne cargo of Indian meal was expected at Shanghai's port next week, and 9,000 tonnes of that had already been sold, a China-based source said.</p>
<p>Towards the end of December, another cargo of U.S. meal was expected in Shanghai, but no further details were available.</p>
<p>Domestic Chinese meal was 2,930 yuan ($353) per tonne.</p>
<p>Indian high protein was about 2,900 yuan ($349) per tonne, FOB Shanghai, compared to its price last month of about 2,950 yuan ($355) per tonne.</p>
<p>U.S. low protein (44 percent) was heard at about 2,850 yuan ($343) per tonne, FOB Shanghai.</p>
<p>(US$1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
