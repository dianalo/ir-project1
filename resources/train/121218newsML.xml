<title>USA: Ford Q3 net meets Wall Street forecasts.</title>
<headline>Ford Q3 net meets Wall Street forecasts.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1996-10-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ford Motor Co's third quarter net profit of $686 million, or $0.56 a share, was in line with Wall Street expectations, but analysts noted concern about losses in Ford's overseas automotive businesses.</p>
<p>Excluding a net gain of $37 million or $0.03 a share from asset sales by Ford's USL Capital unit, Ford earned $649 million, or $0.53 a share.  First Call Corp.'s consensus estimate for the automaker was $0.52 a share, excluding extraordinary items.  </p>
<p>Ford shares were off 1/2 to 32-3/4 in early trading.</p>
<p>Ford's earnings for the July-September period rose 92 percent from year-earlier profits of $357 million, or $0.27 a share, but much of the increase came from financial services, not cars and trucks.</p>
<p>Ford's Financial Services Group earned a record $671 million despite a 16.2 percent drop in Ford Motor Credit Co's earnings to $299 million from $357 million.  In the third quarter of 1995, Financial Services earned $558 million.  </p>
<p>Ford's automotive operations, hurt by losses in Europe and South America, earned just $15 million, compared with a year earlier loss of $201 million.</p>
<p>But third quarter losses in Europe widened to $472 million from $320 million a year ago, while losses in South America, mostly in Brazil, increased to $226 million from $102 million in the 1995 period.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's some real red flags there with overseas operations and Ford Credit,&quot; said Bear Stearns auto analyst Nicholas Lobocarro. &quot;I would have expected to see better results in Europe.&quot;  </p>
<p>The third quarter is typically the weakest of the year, but General Motors Corp said Tuesday that it earned a $75 million profit in Europe in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $98 million.  GM's international operations earned a $323 million profit for the quarter, up from $111 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Both GM and Chrysler Corp soundly exceeded Wall Street estimates.  Chrysler nearly doubled its earnings to $680 million, or $0.93 a share, while GM's profits from continuing operations more than tripled to $1.3 billion, or $1.57 a share.</p>
<p>Ford's U.S. automotive operations earned a third-quarter record of $634 million, up from $187 million a year ago. However, Lobocarro said he was not confident of Ford's ability to sustain strong U.S. automotive earnings in a weaker market.</p>
