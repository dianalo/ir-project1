<p>Investors planning to buy Venezuela's state-owned aluminium company CVG will have to provide guarantees for 125 percent of its debts under the privatisation contract, Venezuela's Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV) privatisation agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government is hoping to privatise the Corporacion Venezolana de Guyana (CVG), which includes aluminium smelters Alcasa and Venalum, bauxite producer Bauxilum and anode producer Carbonorca, in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to minise Venezuela's risks, the buyer would have to supply a guarantee in relation to its shareholding equivalent to 125 percent of the obligations currently held by the government,&quot; the FIV said in a statement.</p>
<p>The long-awaited privatisation contract is due to be presented to Congress on Thursday for approval. The proposed contract specifies that 70 percent of CVG's capital would be transferred to a privatisation vehicle, called a Share Depository, and buyers would be chosen by a public offering after a system of pre-qualification, FIV said.</p>
<p>The remaining 30 percent would be held by the FIV to be sold to employees and to the local and international stock markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The Share Depository and the companies would pay an annual fee to the government as an incentive to encourage the Share Depository to restructure the debt and so free the government of its guarantees,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Buyers would also have to guarantee current labour rights for a period of two years and would not be allowed to interfere in the employee share scheme devised by the FIV and CVG.</p>
<p>The privatisation contract also contains clauses on environmental policy, share sales, and supply guarantees.</p>
