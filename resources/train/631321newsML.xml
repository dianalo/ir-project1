<title>CANADA: INSTANT VIEW - Canada GDP.</title>

<p>Following are reactions to first quarter GDP data released by Statistics Canada on Monday.</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast a 1.0 percent rise in the first quarter.:</p>
<p>&quot;I think they're a little weaker than anticipated at 3.4 percent, but a lot of that is due to inventories. So in general that suggests to me that we've got a pretty broad-based expansion underway. Most of the categories of final domestic demand are very strong for the quarter,&quot; said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Montreal.  </p>
<p>&quot;The headline number, 3.4 percent growth is a little bit misleading. If you take a look at final domestic demand it rose 6.4 percent,&quot; said Mark Chandler, senior economist with Goldman Sachs Canada. &quot;Going forward what you're likely to see is further stock building and continued growth in those sectors that drove us in the first quarter.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;The GDP figure is a lot stronger than the headline 3.4 percent number suggests,&quot; said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;All the domestic components, other than the government sector, were very strong.&quot;</p>
