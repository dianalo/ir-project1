<headline>Probe into Kennedy babysitter scandal ends.</headline>
<dateline>DEDHAM, Mass. 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>The prosecutor investigating allegations that Michael Kennedy had sex with his family's teenage babysitter said on Tuesday he was ending his probe because the alleged victim and her family had refused to cooperate.</p>
<p>Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey Locke said the cooperation of the victim and the family would be &quot;a critical component&quot; in any prosecution of Kennedy, son of late Sen. Robert Kennedy.</p>
<p>Locke said he considered &quot;the victim's desire, her emotional well-being and her state of mind...(and) we will honour the victim's desire not to commence a grand jury investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that his office &quot;stands ready, willing and able to pursue this investigation should she or her family&quot; change their minds.</p>
<p>Locke began the probe after reports in April that Kennedy, 39, allegedly carried on a five-year affair with the babysitter that started when she was under-age.</p>
<p>The allegations became public after Kennedy and his wife, Victoria Gifford Kennedy separated after 16 years of marriage.</p>
