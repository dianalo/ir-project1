<headline>German DAX firms in post-bourse, eyes 3,000 points.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-13</dateline>

<p>German shares climbed further into record territory on Monday following Wall Street's higher end-of-week close last Friday and backed by a firm dollar and German debt market.</p>
<p>The DAX-30 index of leading German shares ended floor trade up 21.56 points or 0.73 percent at 2,954.95 after touching an all-time high of 2,961.25 earlier in the session.</p>
<p>The IBIS-DAX electronic post-bourse index later closed a touch higher than the bourse level at 2,956.78, 1.41 percent up on its previous close.</p>
<p>Dealers said that, while there had been a noticeable slow-down in buying interest later in the day, further gains could be expected. &quot;I think the market will look to test 3,000 points this week,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The first likely test of such market optimism are the U.S. consumer price data due to be released on Tuesday, traders said, noting the clear signals such information gave about the inflationary outlook in the U.S.</p>
<p>Some dealers thought it likely that the share index would slip down to around 2,880 after the U.S. data, before making an assault on 3,000 perhaps next week.</p>
<p>Among individual shares, DAX-30 stocks largely kept up with the wider market gain, while electronic trading over the IBIS dealing systems were affected early on by interruptions caused by technical faults that lasted for nearly two hours.</p>
<p>Shares in telephone giant Deutsche Telekom closed down seven pfennigs at 30.45 marks as German banks, until last Friday forbidden from publishing analysis on Telekom, gave the stock a mixed reception in their first recommendations.</p>
<p>In IBIS trade, the stock fell further to touch an all-time low of 29.80, still however comfortably above the offer price of 28.50 marks in its flotation late last year.</p>
<p>The German incumbent telecom operator received valuations ranging from &quot;underweight&quot; -- suggesting that investors should not hold too many Telekom shares in their portfolio -- through to &quot;undervalued&quot;, implying its shares were set to rise further.</p>
<p>Dealers said the overall consensus of the reports was more positive than had been expected and said that the stock had fallen largely because of U.S. investors taking profits.</p>
