<p>Belgium's Bel-20 index of leading shares, basking again in its glory after notching up another percent on Thursday, will continue to stroll on the upward trail, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The climat remains favourable. The dollar has jumped with such a force that we don't expect it to fall back like that. We also expect interest rates to stay low,&quot; said Stefan Casteleyn at Antwerp brokerage Corluy &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 closed 22.42 points higher at 2,193.53 after earlier touching a new record high of 2,195.48. A high 4.9 billion francs worth of Belgian shares were traded.</p>
<p>Casteleyn noted that at the end of 1996 he had set a 12-month target for the Bel-20 of 2,300 points, which at the time made him by far the most optimistic analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it might just have been too conservative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said that investors were buying &quot;just anything&quot;. &quot;We call them loose hands, they will also be the first ones to sell once the market turns,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Casteleyn said that holdings such as GBL and smaller stocks such as holdings Mosane and Belcofi were still a buy at current levels.</p>
<p>GBL, which closed 50 francs higher at 5,200, was still quoted 25 percent lower at 4,085 francs just two months ago.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet it's still attractive,&quot; Castelyn said. He said that holdings had -- and still have -- a considerable discount in relation to their intrinsic value and had originally been 30 percent in some cases.</p>
<p>Traders said that both institutionals and retail investors were still on a buying spree.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the retail investors decide to invest in shares once their bonds mature and the only other option is to invest at much lower rates,&quot; Casteleyn said.</p>
<p>Diversified shipping group CMB was the day's leading gainer with a 3.6 percent leap to 2,720 francs, which traders put down to the dollar effect and the fact it had taken it longer than other shares to start its rise.</p>
<p>Insurer Fortis AG came second with a 2.7 percent gain to 6,410 but one trader referred to a recent positive assessment which said the share had the potential to soar to 7,000.</p>
