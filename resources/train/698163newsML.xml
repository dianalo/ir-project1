<headline>Warner-Lambert gains after analyst comments.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Warner-Lambert Co gained more than five percent on Tuesday amid growing optimism for sales of two new drugs, analysts said.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert was 6-5/16 higher at 130-9/16 in early afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert spokesman Stephen Mock said the company did not comment on daily stock fluctuations, though he said several analysts recently raised their estimates for sales of Lipitor and Rezulin. Lipitor, launched in February, is used to reduce cholesterol. Rezulin, introduced in March, is for patients with Type II diabetes who are already taking insulin.  </p>
<p>Warner-Lambert declined to provide a sales forecast for the drugs. It said both Lipitor and Rezulin have quickly gained a sizeable share of the market.</p>
<p>Based on sales for the week of June 20, Lipitor has captured about 20.8 percent of new retail prescriptions for the total cholesterol market. Rezulin has gained about 7.5 percent of the diabetes market, Mock said.</p>
<p>&quot;Analysts have very aggressive estimates based on the prescription trends,&quot; Mock said.  </p>
<p>Smith Barney added Warner-Lamber to its list of 15 &quot;Exception Names,&quot; a portfolio of stocks it considers &quot;particularly attractive&quot; over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Based on the strength of Lipitor and Rezulin, Morgan Stanley said it increased its earnings estimates for Warner-Lambert to $3.20 a share from $3.15 a share for 1997 and to $4.20 a share from $4.00 a share for 1998.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer also recently raised its 1997 estimate to $3.18 a share from $3.10 and its 1998 estimate to $4.00 from $3.85.</p>
<p>Several analysts said they expected both Lipitor and Rezulin to generate annual sales of about $2.0 billion within the next five years.</p>
