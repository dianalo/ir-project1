<p>Spain's largest bank, the Santander group, reported a jump of more than 30 percent in first-half earnings on Tuesday, as its Latin American shopping spree paid off and domestic business thrived.</p>
<p>Net attributable earnings climbed to 59.78 billion pesetas ($386 million) from 45.90 in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>&quot;The overall results have been exceptional,&quot; bank spokesman Federico Ysart told journalists at a briefing. &quot;It is reasonable to assume that the bank will maintain these growth levels (for the full-year).&quot;</p>
<p>The first-half profit jump was well above analysts' average forecasts for a rise of 20.8 percent in net attributable income.</p>
<p>&quot;The results are good and I think they are going to be sustainable,&quot; a Madrid-based analyst said. &quot;I think they are going to maintain them to the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts, though disappointed by a sharp rise in costs to 236.79 billion from 185.43 billion pesetas, said bank investments aimed at increasing market share were paying off with improvement visible in funds, deposits and loans.</p>
<p>&quot;The results are positive and we value highly the increase in market share, the good Latin American performance and the improvement in margins,&quot; said Juan de Dios Sanchez, analyst at Ahorro Corp Financiera.</p>
<p>Santander has ploughed some $3.4 billion into Latin America this decade, diversifying in the face of narrowing domestic profit margins and revenue losses tied to the launch of Europe's single currency, set for 1999.</p>
<p>In the first half, Latin America contributed some 22.52 billion pesetas to earnings, the bank said. First-half accounts include results from four Latam banks not included in last year's accounts.</p>
<p>&quot;Excluding goodwill amortization, and the financial costs associated with these investments, the combined contribution of retail banking and Santander Investment from this region came to 22.52 billion pesetas, well in line with the estimated income of $400 million for the full year,&quot; Santander said in a report to shareholders.</p>
<p>Taking into account the payment of goodwill and financial costs, Latin American profits attributable to the group represent some 17 percent of group net attributable earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;The results are good and the contribution of Latin America continues to rise,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts also pointed to strides the bank had made in net interest income -- a traditional measure of banking business that has been under pressure as official interest rates decline.</p>
<p>Excluding some dividends, revenues from loans after the cost of deposits rose 27.5 percent in the first half, as Santander managed to hold the line on this key measure of revenues from lending after the cost of deposits.</p>
