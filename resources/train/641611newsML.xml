<title>AUSTRALIA: Hardie eyes fifth U.S. fibre cement plant.</title>

<p>Australian-based building products group James Hardie Industries Ltd said on Thursday it was considering building a fifth U.S. fibre cement products plant somewhere in Ohio.</p>
<p>Hardie Managing Director Keith Barton told reporters after an analyst's briefing the group was likely to make a final decision about a A$50 million one-line fibre cement plant in Ohio in the next six months.</p>
<p>&quot;It's likely that we will have a fifth plant. It's most likely that it will be in Ohio. It's just the timing that is uncertain,&quot; Barton said.  </p>
<p>The plant would help Hardie better and more cheaply service the mid-western regions of the United States.</p>
<p>Hardie currently has plants in Florida, California, Texas and Washington which are expected to produce between 500 million square foot to 600 million square foot of fibre cement in the year to March 31, 1998, 170 percent up on 1995/96.</p>
<p>The one-line plant in Ohio would be about 150 million square foot or 20 million square metres of fibre cement annually, Barton said.  </p>
<p>Hardie aimed to increase its capital expenditure to A$240.5 million in the 1997/98 year from A$215.8 million in 1996/97, which was itself up from A$140.6 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>This is largely due to the construction of new fibre cement plants in the United States.</p>
<p>Earlier in the analyst's briefing, Barton said Hardie expected some price pressures on its U.S. fibre cement operations in 1997/98 as new competition came on line and as Hardie targeted competition in the engineered wood products markets. Margins however would not necessarily be cut, he said.  </p>
<p>Sales volumes would continue to grow and economies of scale were still to be obtained, he said.</p>
<p>Barton said a key competitor for Hardie in the United States over the next year would be ABT Building Products Corp, which was expected to have a fibre cement production line up and running later in the year.</p>
<p>Hardie understood timber and banking group Temple-Inland Inc would enter the market, but was an unknown quantity.</p>
<p>Earlier James Hardie announced its results for the year to March 31, showing net profits jumped to A$83 million from A$32.2 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>But this was due largely to a A$31.7 million abnormal profit from asset sales and profit before abnormals fell 12.3 percent to A$51.3 million because of sharply lower Australasian buliding materials profits. This was in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Hardie kept its final dividend unchanged at 6.5 cents per share, taking full year dividends to an unchanged 13.0 cents per share.</p>
<p>Earnings per share fell to 13.1 cents per share for the year from 15.2 cents in 1995/96.  </p>
<p>Hardie said its dividends in 1997/98 were not likely to be fully franked because of new legislation expected to clamp down on the trading franking credits and because of Hardie's increasing offshore earnings.</p>
<p>Hardie's share price was down 10 cents at A$4.10 by 1.20 p.m. (0320 GMT).</p>
<p>Hardie is about 28 percent owned by Brierley Investments Ltd.</p>
