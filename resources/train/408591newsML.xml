<p>Hundreds of Irish couples were expected to file for the dissolution of their broken marriages on Wednesday under new legislation legalising divorce in Roman Catholic Ireland for the first time.</p>
<p>Lawyers said they expected a small percentage of the estimated 45,000 legally-separated couples to take advantage of the new law, which came into effect after the most divisive referendum in the history of the young state.</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt we'll see a stampede towards the family courts, more of a trickle. But divorce will definitely become a part of our daily work from now on,&quot; said one Cork solicitor who was filing two divorce applications later in the day.</p>
<p>Divorce, outlawed in Ireland's 1920s constitution, became technically legal after a 1995 referendum which permitted separated people to re-marry by less than one percentage point, the closest result in any Irish referendum.</p>
<p>But enabling legislation did not take effect until recently. A dying man secured Ireland's first divorce of modern times last month when he successfully appealed to the High Court that his constitutional rights were being infringed by the delay.</p>
<p>He was granted a divorce and married the woman with whom he had been living for some years and died shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>In many rural areas signs saying &quot;Save the Family, Vote No to Divorce&quot; still flutter from telegraph poles and fences reminding visitors of the strength of opposition to the measure in the Irish countryside, where the church is a powerful force.</p>
<p>Opponents of divorce argued that it would wreck families and homes and mark a point of no return from Ireland's heritage in which the church and the family were the cornerstones of life.</p>
<p>But all political parties argued that the outlawing of divorce prevented separated couples from remarrying and reconstructing their lives and those of any offspring.</p>
<p>Legal experts said that the first legal divorces could be announced in four weeks' time if they were uncontested. But many couples would face delays because the Irish legal system was already heavily burdened and under-prepared.</p>
<p>The justice ministry has promised to appoint more judges to family courts which deal with such matters but critics say the court is concentrated in Dublin and more resources will be required outside the capital.</p>
<p>The Irish Law Board has run courses to familiarise solicitors with the new task and says that requests to attend have far outstripped availability of places.</p>
<p>Close to 1,000 couples have applied to the Irish Legal Aid Board, which helps people with cash problems get representation, for financial help and more are expected.</p>
<p>Estimates of how much divorce will cost range from between 1,000 and 2,000 Irish pounds ($1,600 - $3,200) where couples agreed on terms. But cases where the couple are in deep dispute could cost proportionately more, lawyers say.</p>
