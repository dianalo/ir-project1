<p>The largest creditor of Poland's debt-ridden construction firm Espebepe SA, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy SA (PBKS), said it has not yet decided on Espebepe's modified debt-relief proposal.</p>
<p>The bank's acceptance of the proposal would save Espebepe, whose debts total 75 million zlotys, from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Espebepe said on Tuesday it wanted its largest creditors to write off 80 percent of its debts instead of the earlier proposed 95-percent write-off.</p>
<p>&quot;A decision on whether to accept or reject Espebepe's proposal has not yet been taken...It's possible the decision will be taken just before creditors meeting on May 16,&quot; a PBKS spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Creditors are expected to decide on on the fate of the company on May 16, after two previous meetings on March 14 and April 14 failed to reach decisions .</p>
<p>Espebepe said the deal would be approved if creditors representing 80 percent of its liabilities voted in favour. It said that according to its offer smaller creditors, to which the company owes less than 7,500 zlotys, would write off 20 percent of the debts.</p>
<p>PBKS earlier said it was ready to write off 40 percent of Espebepe's debt and to change the remainder into convertible bonds, but Espebepe rejected the proposal as unrealistic.</p>
