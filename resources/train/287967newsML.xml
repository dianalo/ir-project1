<headline>Rada asks holders to wait on Kamer dispute.</headline>

<p>Rada Electronic Industries Ltd said on Monday it asked its shareholders to wait for further clarification on the activities of Rienk Kamer and the investment companies he advises, International Publishing Holding SA and Imaginative Business and Marketing Ltd.</p>
<p>Rada, based in Herzliya Pituach, Israel, said International Publishing recently acquired 420,364 Rada shares and Imaginative Business bought 11.1 million shares through the conversion of convertible notes acquired earlier this year. Kamer and the two companies own about 1,567,122 shares of Rada common stock, or 19.8 percent.  </p>
<p>The companies have sued to enjoin the company's annual meeting and have an extraordinary meeting called.</p>
<p>Rada said it was seeking to have the annual meeting reconvened and the votes of shareholders as of the record date previously established in the ordinary course recorded.</p>
<p>The company said the board would defer any decision on an extraordinary meeting until it resolves the matter of the annual meeting. A hearing is scheduled for January 7 at the Tel Aviv District Court in Israel. Rada added it was trying to learn more about Kamer and the two companies with the help of forms filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
