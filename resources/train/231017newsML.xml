<title>MEXICO: Mexican leftists reunite to protest disappearances.</title>

<p>Mexican leftist groups said on Monday they were reviving a movement abandoned four years ago to call attention to kidnappings and disappearances of dissidents.</p>
<p>The National Front Against Repression first appeared in 1979 with mothers going on hunger strikes to protest the disappearance of their sons. The movement split up 13 years later when former President Carlos Salinas created the government's National Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>But leftist groups told a news conference on Monday that the commission's efforts have been insufficient and accused the government of complicity with continuing disappearances.</p>
<p>&quot;The armed forces are involved in the disappearances,&quot; said Enrique Gonzales, a spokesman with the National Democratic Lawyers Front.</p>
<p>Gonzales protested what he called an increasing military presence in the country, saying President Ernesto Zedillo's vow in September to apply the &quot;full weight of the state&quot; in fighting rebel groups constituted a threat to human rights.</p>
<p>Organisers of the front's revival claim 438 leftists were currently listed as dead or missing. Many of the disappeared have later turned up dead, their bodies discovered hanging from a tree or placed at the site of an apparent accident, the front claims.</p>
<p>&quot;A hidden arm of power is operating ... spying on citizens, sending anonymous notes to adversaries, intervening in private communication, following people in daylight to intimidate ... all with the cover of official power,&quot; Gonzales said.</p>
