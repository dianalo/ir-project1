<headline>LIFFE coffee futures end down, May under pressure.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE coffee futures closed lower across the board on Monday with front-month May coming under selling pressure before the first tender day and the implementation of the exchange grading rules.</p>
<p>Traders noted a wave of switches, against actuals and crosses all confined to the May and the nearby July position.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all related to the grading rules,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>May finished $40 down at $1,550 a tonne while July closed at $1,600, still $28 down, after battling with the key support level.</p>
<p>The new LIFFE grading rules come into effect with the July contract. Traders said operators were wary of taking delivery of May coffee in case they have to put it back on the July contract.</p>
<p>Under the rules, current grading specifications wouild be valued for deliveries until May but all previously graded coffee would have to be re-graded for delivery from July onwards.</p>
<p>When the exchange announced the snap changes last December, the premium on the May contract against July shrank to zero from $15 on the news.</p>
<p>By the close on Monday, May stood at a wide $50 discount to July against $38 on Friday. Open interest in May continued to decline ahead of the first tender day on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders said May/July switches were traded at $59 on Monday afternoon after changing hands at $35-$48 in the morning.</p>
<p>Overall volume reached a brisk 9,000 lots, centred on May and Julu positions.</p>
<p>Pending a sharp movement in New York, the London market is likely to stay in at current range with the upside being capped by origin selling notably from Indonesia.</p>
<p>The amount of coffee being graded so far in April has been quite large. By Monday, 2,431 five-tonne lots were graded, of which 1,515 were untenderable.</p>
<p>There was also talk that a large European trade house was seeking to tender a large quantity of Thai robusta coffee against LIFFE's May contract.</p>
<p>But the market's downside risk seemed limited for now.</p>
<p>&quot;Roasters still have a lot of price-fixing to do,&quot; said one trader. &quot;This is likely to keep the market above the $1,550 area, (basis July).&quot;</p>
