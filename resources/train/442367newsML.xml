<p>A tender for the partial privatisation of Slovak state-owned telecom monopoly, Slovenske Telekomunikacie (ST) s.p., may be ready by the end of the year, a senior ST official told the technical periodical Infotrendy.</p>
<p>&quot;The year 1998 could be problematic in view of the scheduled general elections and that is why we hope to find a strategic partner by the end of this year,&quot; ST General Director Peter Valent told Infotrendy in its latest edition published on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not need a foreign partner which would tie our hands...we need a partner to bring the only thing we still need -- the cash for investment. The (foreign) partner should not manage us but only advise us during a certain period,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Valent said that it was still open whether the government would chose a single strategic partner for the ST or a consortium of firms.</p>
<p>The government said last year that it planned to sell 25 to 30 percent in ST through an increase of the company's basic capital. ST is one of the few fully state-owned telecom companies left in central Europe.</p>
<p>The authorities have, however, long delayed ST's transformation to a state-run joint-stock company, a move that is neccessary to legally proceed with the partial privatisation of the company.</p>
<p>&quot;The transformation (to a joint-stock company) should have long been completed, and today we could be preparing tender conditions,&quot; Valent said.</p>
<p>He added ST, in cooperation with its foreign consultant, British investment bank N.M. Rothschild, has alreday worked out an analysis for the international tender and was ready to begin the process.</p>
