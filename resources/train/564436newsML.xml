<p>The Australian bond pre-budget rally stalled ahead of the first leg of the U.S. refunding auctions later Tuesday, but not before yields had dipped to their lowest levels since February.</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped below 7.70 percent at one stage as the market continued to price in a friendly budget, which expected to see a further sharp reduction or even no fixed interest bond issuance in 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;We might get a last gasp rally to 7.50 percent on the long bond on the back of a good budget,&quot; said Stephen Koukoulas, chief economist at Citibank Australia.  </p>
<p>The market will be keeping a wary eye on the Reserve Bank of Australia's market operations on Wednesday at 9.30 a.m. (2330 GMT) on the slimmest off chances of a policy announcement following today's board meeting.</p>
<p>Economists do not expect the central bank to ease official interest rates, currently at 6.0 percent, following last week's strong first quarter wages report, even though unemployment remains high and the inflation outlook remains benign.</p>
<p>The market will receive an update on the labour force on Thursday when April statistics are due, which are seen showing a rebound in employment, but unemployment staying at 8.7 percent.  </p>
<p>The market will also be keen to hear the RBA's thinking on policy when the central bank governor Ian Macfarlane faces a parliamentary finance committee, also on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the meantime, U.S. Treasuries will provide the focus with the first stage of the refunding auctions due later on Tuesday when A$17.0 billion of three-year notes are on offer.</p>
<p>There will be also US$12.0 billion of 10-year notes auctions on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>Yield spreads narrowed again against the U.S., although differentials were above the day's in early after hours trading. Domestic bonds were outpaced by New Zealand, which released data showing higher than expected unemployment at 6.4 percent in the March quarter and a 0.1 percent fall in employment.  </p>
