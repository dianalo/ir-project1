<headline>OPTIONS - U.S. T-bond vols plunge after jobs data.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for U.S. Treasury bond options plunged as bond prices rebounded after the February employment report and forced the market to take out risk premium built into options, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been really choppy and very busy,&quot; said a brokerage trader at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).</p>
<p>Implied volatility for CBOT April T-bond futures options, which expire in two weeks and therefore have high gamma acceleration, plummetted to 8.6 percent by mid-morning from 10.7 at Thursday's close. It had briefly popped up to about 11 percent early in the session.  </p>
<p>A high-gamma option has quicker premium acceleration against gyration in the underlying asset price but are vulnerable to time decay.</p>
<p>June volatility tumbled to 9.1 percent from Thursday's 9.9 percent.</p>
<p>The T-bond market climbed into positive territory as the market digested the jobs data after falling sharply on the headline payrolls numbers.</p>
<p>Non-farm payrolls increased by 339,000 in February against an average Wall Street estimate of 230,000 and January's revised rise of 247,000.  </p>
<p>Just as quickly as June T-bond futures fell initially to 108-23/32, down 26/32 on the day, they jumped to 109-29/32, up 12/32, and drifted near that level for most of the morning as the market's focus turned to benign wage increases.</p>
<p>Hourly earnings rose by three cents to $12.09 in February.</p>
<p>Traders said time decay weighed heavily going into the weekend, particularly on the April options, even though many in the market were still skeptical how much further bond prices could bounce back, given widespread expectation of a near-term Federal Reserve tightening.  </p>
<p>At the shorter end of the yield curve, Eurodollar volatilities were also sharply lower.</p>
<p>&quot;They had it pretty substantially pumped up (prior to the jobs data),&quot; said an investment bank trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).</p>
<p>Volatilities for June and September Eurodollar futures options off about three quarters of a point each to 9.8 and 12.8 percent respectively. The high-gamma short-March options, which are options expiring on March 14 but priced from March 1998 futures, saw their volatility drop to 15.8 percent from an early high of about 25 and Thursday's close of about 23.</p>
