<p>ICFI Bank, a unit of Russia's Uneximbank, and investment bank Renaissance Capital are considering bidding for a 25 percent plus one share stake in telecom holding Svyazinvest, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Uneximbank head Vladimir Potanin said ICFI (Bank MFK) was talking with financial investors, not foreign telecom operators, and was considering putting up $500 million of its own funds for the state-held stake, which has a starting price of $1.18 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;If we win, we will take part in management,&quot; Potanin said after a news conference to announce a merger between ICFI and Renaissance, Bank MFK-Renaissance.</p>
<p>Potanin said his group was discussing the deal with Deutsche Bank, among other financial groups.</p>
<p>&quot;If the decision (to bid) is made, then we intend to use $500 million of our own funds, and raise the rest with the help of Russian and foreign investors. However, at this time, a final decision has not been taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Svyazinvest has controlling stakes in 88 regional and other telecom companies and is considered a key to the Russian domestic telecom industry and a crown jewel enterprise.</p>
<p>The government auction for the first stake ends July 25 and Russia plans to sell another 24 percent stake thereafter.</p>
<p>Renaissance Capital head Boris Jordan, who will manage the merged Bank MFK-Renaissance, told reporters there were more than five potential Svyazinvest bidders.</p>
<p>&quot;From what I know there are multiple players -- more than five,&quot; Jordan told reporters.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on whether MFK-Renaissance would bid for the second stake, which will be open only to Russian investors.</p>
<p>Uneximbank is known in Russian as Oneximbank.</p>
