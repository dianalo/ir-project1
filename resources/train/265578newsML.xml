<p>The introduction of telephone interviewing had no noticeable impact on the Australian employment rate so far, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point in time, after the four-month period August to November 1996, no noticeable effect on the employment rate for each of the months has been detected,&quot; the (ABS) said.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the data have said that the ABS had noticed an effect on the unemployment rate from the progressive replacement of the face-to-face technique with telephone interviewing.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for the bureau declined to quantify the difference in unemployment rates detected by the two methods during the phase-in period.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not commenting beyond the statement,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The statement also said: &quot;The ABS will continue to closely monitor the key labour force series for any significant effects as the phase-in continues. If, and when, any noticeable effect is detected the ABS will report it in the monthly publication Labour Force, Australia.&quot;  </p>
<p>Other countries, such as Canada, Britain and the United States, had introduced telephone interviewing without detrimentally affecting the key labour data, the bureau said.</p>
<p>&quot;Telephone interviewing can deliver productivity improvements without loss of data quality and timeliness.&quot;</p>
<p>The sample in the bureau's monthly population survey, which produces the labour statistics, is divided into eight panels each of about 8,000 people. Each month the bureau replaces a panel.</p>
<p>Since August, every new panel has been a telephone panel as the bureau phases in the new method.  </p>
<p>The sources told Reuters that telephone interviewing produced an unemployment rate about half a percentage point higher than the old method in the first few months of the phase-in.</p>
<p>After the latest data was included, the difference was lower but still positive, they said.</p>
<p>The bureau has not conducted a parallel study of the two methods and is relying on the phase-in period to detect any effect.  </p>
<p>No-one has suggested that the new method is less accurate. Rather, the issue has been any distortion in the rate of change of the unemployment rate during the phase-in.</p>
<p>The Australian Statistician, Bill McLennan, said in a speech in July that overseas experience suggested a small but probably insignificant positive effect on the unemployment rate from telephone interviewing.</p>
