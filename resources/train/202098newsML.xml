<headline>OPTIONS - Bund puts busy as Ifo, M3 slices futures.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-20</dateline>

<p>Investors jumped into Bund put options on Wednesday as strong economic data brought the recent rally in the futures market to a halt, brokers said.</p>
<p>Volumes were robust and trade lively but implied volatility held broadly steady, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been exceedingly busy today,&quot; said Steven West, options broker at GNI here. &quot;There's been a lot of activity on the put side. In fact the most popular strike has been the 101.00 put in Dec.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said volumes swelled after Germany reported that the Ifo business climate index shot to 97.4 in October, well above expectations of 96.0 and compared to 95.7 in September.</p>
<p>October M3 money supply was also released, showing growth of 8.4 percent, steady on September but still stubbornly above the Bundesbank's four to seven percent target.</p>
<p>By 1527 GMT, December Bund futures were down 32 basis points at 100.87, off the 100.70 low of the day.</p>
<p>Brokers quoted implied volatility of March options at 5.10 percent, slightly firmer than 5.05 percent first thing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility has not gone up quite as sharply as one might have expected,&quot; West said.</p>
<p>Volatility of December options was largely irrelevant with the contract set to expire on Friday, brokers said. This however, made the options cheap and many investors were taking on last-minute trades in December, they said.</p>
<p>At the 101.00 put strike, more than 10,800 lots had been traded, with a European bank buying around 6,000, West said.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were looking to square up their December options and move further out into January and March, as well as get short of Bunds as the rally halted. Bunds hit a new contract high of 101.28 on Tuedsay, climbing up from 99.46 on November 5.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that people have been doing today is a desire to get short,&quot; said a broker at an American institution in London. &quot;As the markets are whipping around at the moment people are buying out-of-the-money.&quot;</p>
<p>Among other trades, West said combos were popular, with one bank buying 99.50 puts and selling 100.50 calls 3,000 times.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically they have been taking fairly bearish positions,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it is all a very healthy clearout and it will get all the stale longs out before it starts again. The underlying tone is still there.&quot;</p>
