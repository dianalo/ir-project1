<title>USA: U.S. April wholesale inventories drop sharply.</title>
<headline>U.S. April wholesale inventories drop sharply.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Inventories of unsold goods on wholesalers' shelves dropped for the first time in seven months during April, the Commerce Department said on Friday, in the face of continuing lackluster sales.</p>
<p>Overall inventories fell 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $257.64 billion -- the first monthly decline since an identical 0.7 percent fall last September -- after a revised 0.5 percent increase in March.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said March inventories had risen more sharply, by 0.7 percent, but it revised that downward.</p>
<p>The bulge in stocks of unsold goods fit with other indications of slowing in the pace of economic activity at the start of the second quarter.</p>
<p>Commerce previously reported that sales at retail stores declined during April. Construction and sales of new and existing homes also weakened from March.</p>
<p>Total wholesale sales were flat during April at $210.19 billion after falling a revised 0.8 percent in March. Previously, the department said March sales had declined 0.9 percent.</p>
<p>The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to deplete inventories at the current sales pace, was the same in April as it was in March at 1.23 months' worth.</p>
<p>All the decline in April inventories occurred among nondurable goods, where stocks of unsold goods tumbled 1.8 percent to $93.61 billion after rising 0.2 percent in March.</p>
<p>Among nondurables that posted the biggest declines were paper products, drugs, petroleum and farm commodities.</p>
<p>Inventories of durables were unchanged in April at $164.03 billion following a 0.7 percent jump in March.</p>
<p>Within that category, inventories of new cars fell 2.7 percent to $26.35 billion in April after a 1.6 percent March rise. Therer was a large increase in furniture inventories that may reflect slower homebuilding, and unsold stocks of lumber and hardware also increased signficantly from March.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department previously reported that first-quarter economic growth accelerated sharply to a 5.8 percent annual rate. But it is widely forecast to slow to less than half that rate of expansion during the second quarter.</p>
<p>Weaker stock-building is consistent with a moderating economy, partly because it suggests companies are trimming stocks in expectation of slower business.</p>
<p>As well, lower rates of inventory-building put a drag on growth since it means that not as many goods are being produced, even if it is only for the purpose of building up stocks.</p>
