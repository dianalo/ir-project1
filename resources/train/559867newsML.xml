<headline>Judge dismisses actor's suit against drug dealer.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>A judge Monday dismissed a wrongful death suit brought by actor Carroll O'Connor -- TV's Archie Bunker -- against the man he claimed caused his son to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey said that O'Connor's suit against Harry Perzigian had been filed after the one-year statute of limitations had expired.</p>
<p>Perzigian, who was sentenced last year to one year in prison for possessing and furnishing cocaine, has a dafamation lawsuit pending against O'Connor, who starred as the working-class bigot Bunker in the hit 1970s comedy &quot;All In the Family&quot;.</p>
<p>Hugh O'Connor, the actor's adopted son, who also appeared with his father in the TV series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, shot himself in the head March 28, 1995.</p>
<p>His father alleged he was under the influence of drugs provided by Perzigian.</p>
<p>Perzigian's suit is based on public statements O'Connor made, alleging Perzigian was &quot;a partner in murder.&quot;</p>
