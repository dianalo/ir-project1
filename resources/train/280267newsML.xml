<p>Czech gross electricity consumption will hit a record high in 1996, exceeding 1989's previous historic high of 62,406 Gigawatt hours (GWh), energy company CEZ a.s. said on Monday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Ladislav Kriz said that extremely cold weather in recent days, when temperatures have hit minus 30 celsius and have regularly been at minus 20, added to the acceleration of consumption.</p>
<p>He added that the 1989 gross production level was reached on December 23.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that net consumption or demand, which excludes losses during transmissions, would also exceed the 1989 maximum of 55,000 GWh. Gross consumption is total production without consumption used up in power plants.</p>
<p>Forecasts made in the early 1990's, during the decline of socialist-era heavy industrial production, anticipated that consumption would return to 1989 levels after the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent estimates were showing that consumption is rising faster (than expected), and therefore it is necessary to mobilise all accessible energy sources,&quot; Kriz said.</p>
<p>CEZ has already said it would delay closing down some of its heavily-polluting coal fuelled power plants until the end of 1998 due to the increasing demand.</p>
<p>The firm is obliged by law to close down plants which are not equipped with filtering devices by the end of 1998.</p>
