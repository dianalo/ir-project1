<p>High sulphur fuel oil prices were assessed steady to firm on Friday, riding on back of firm crude levels but talk was thin, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur 180-cst fuel oil levels were quoted Thursday at $123/$125 for January loading supplies, but January fuel oil swaps were firmer Friday at $121.25/$122.00 per tonne, up around 25 cents on the day.</p>
<p>Traders said firm Brent crude prices offered some support. February Brent rose on SIMEX to $23.50, up 11 cents from their pervious London close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A bid was seen in the market at $124 for 180-cst material.  </p>
<p>Fuel oil traders said prices could face pressure near term as some more Mideast supplies arrive by late January and in the face of lacklutre Chinese demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand from China appears to have come to a temporary halt,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>But Chinese importers told Reuters current prices were too high and importers are holding off purchases until later.</p>
<p>At least two Mideast cargoes were heard to be arriving by late January, traders said.</p>
