<p>Russia, better known as a debtor than as a creditor state, will decide by June whether to join the Paris Club of creditor nations, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be clear within two months,&quot; Kasyanov told Reuters. &quot;In any case it will be clear before the June G-7 or G-8 meeting in Denver.&quot;</p>
<p>Representatives of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries meet on June 20-22, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin will also join the talks.</p>
<p>Russia, which inherited responsibility for both the assets and the liabilities of the former Soviet Union, is owed about $132 billion by Soviet-era debtors including Vietnam, Ethiopia, Yemen, Cuba and Iraq.</p>
<p>It has rescheduled most of its own Soviet-era debts and borrowed some $20 billion in its own right, mostly from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Most Soviet-era loans were to so-called friendly states, extended for political reasons rather than for economic ones.</p>
<p>Moscow currently receives just $1-2 billion a year -- half of it in goods -- and officials have given up hope of getting some of the money back. &quot;It is less than one tenth of what we should receive,&quot; Kasyanov said.</p>
<p>He said membership of the Paris Club could improve the terms Russia received from its country debtors.</p>
<p>Countries owing Russia $37 billion already have agreements with the club or are in talks with it and Russia would expect to receive the same deal as other creditors. &quot;We have to agree with the Paris Club how much to discount the $37 billion,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise that the price of Russia's assets is lower than the assets of other Paris Club members, but the question is how much lower,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But Kasyanov said Russia would not join the Paris Club if the price was wrong.</p>
<p>He said Russia was looking at problem countries not wishing to undergo a Paris Club debt restructuring plan and would decide later how to settle problems, including securitising some debt.</p>
<p>He said Russia in owed about $120 billion in its own right, $100 billion of inherited from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Russia owes Paris Club states $40 billion and it rescheduled the debts for up to 25 years in 1995.</p>
<p>It owes about $35 billion to the London Club of commercial bank creditors, but these loans have also been rescheduled.</p>
<p>Kasyanov said Russia had been extending about $0.5 billion annually in credits since 1994. &quot;Now the major idea is not to give money to those who do not pay back,&quot; he said.</p>
