<p>Latvian shares gained slightly in light trade on Thursday as interim results rolled in, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overall market volume was a sluggish 68,000 lats and the Rietumu index inched up 0.06 percent to 150.64.</p>
<p>Secondary stock Jekabpils Sugar was the session's biggest gainer, rising almost 14 percent to 66 santimes as the market responded to its official interim profit figure of over 500,000 lats, which far exceeded expectations.</p>
<p>But dealers said its gains could be short-lived.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the seasonal nature of this industry, its second half result will almost certainly fall,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Confectionery plant Staburzadze moved up to 2.74 lats from 2.73 lats in trade of 7,400 lats after the Wednesday release of its six-month results.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were in line with market expectations and did not anticipate that the share would gain much further.</p>
<p>Daugavpils Chain, which also released its results on Wednesday, was the most active stock in trade of 16,300 lats at the unchanged price of 1.07 lats.</p>
<p>Unibanka also stayed put at 3.25 lats as 15,000 lats worth of its shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Dealers expect it to fall next week when the state auctions one million of the bank's shares at a minimum of 3.05 lats.</p>
<p>But they say that its current price level still looks cheap and continues to generate interest.</p>
