<title>UK: British artist questioned in body parts probe.</title>
<headline>British artist questioned in body parts probe.</headline>

<p>Police have arrested a butcher-turned-sculptor with connections to Britain's royal family after they discovered 30 human body parts in a macabre investigation.</p>
<p>Anthony-Noel Kelly, a cousin of the Duke of Norfolk and part-time teacher at heir to the throne Prince Charles's Institute of Architecture, has been released on bail and will appear in court next week, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Police quizzed him following raids on a London studio and country house last week. Kelly refused to comment on the case but his lawyer, Mark Stephens, said the 41-year-old artist was co-operating with police.</p>
<p>&quot;Police are investigating allegations of theft and burying bodies without consent,&quot; a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>They launched the investigation following a request from the government's Inspector of Anatomy, Dr Laurence Martin.</p>
<p>An art lover allegedly recognised a deceased man in one of Kelly's sculptures exhibited in a London art gallery. Kelly had used a mould of the man's head showing part of his brain cut away.</p>
<p>Martin, a civil servant in charge of anatomical investigations, was looking into possible violations of the Anatomy Act, which forbids the illegal use of human body parts.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Department of Health said he had also written to medical schools in Britain alerting them to the possible sale of human remains. Police were quoted as saying they were revolted by what they found during the raids.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some 20 to 30 pieces of human remains. It was frankly unbelievable. Even for officers used to dealing with some horrific case, it was sickening,&quot; a detective told The Mirror newspaper.</p>
<p>Kelly won recognition for his moulds of heads, feet and torsos which he claimed was his way of immortalising the dead. Some of his works, gilded in silver and gold, sold for thousands of pounds (dollars).</p>
<p>&quot;I have no qualms about doing this work. I wouldn't wish to hurt anyone. While I find beauty in death, these are nevertheless rotting bodies, &quot; he said in an interview before the investigation was launched.</p>
