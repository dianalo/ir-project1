<title>USA: Lawmakers plan crime bills to stop snooping at IRS.</title>
<headline>Lawmakers plan crime bills to stop snooping at IRS.</headline>

<p>Lawmakers said Monday they would introduce legislation making it a crime for Internal Revenue Service employees to inspect taxpayer files without authorisation.</p>
<p>Representative Bill Archer, the chairman of the House tax-writing committee, said he would introduce an &quot;anti-browsing&quot; bill Tuesday and expected it to go before the full House for a vote April 15, the tax filing deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;No one in a position of power at the IRS should be able to browse through personal, private taxpayer information with impunity. That's why we need this new law,&quot; said Archer, a Texas Republican.</p>
<p>The measure follows a federal appeals court decision in February that overturned a guilty verdict against a Ku Klux Klansman employed by the IRS who browsed through tax records of suspected white supremacists and other taxpayers, the House Ways and Means Committee said.</p>
<p>The Archer bill would create a criminal penalty in the Internal Revenue Code making it illegal for any IRS employee to inspect tax returns without authorisation, punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of not more than one year.</p>
<p>Sen. John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, said he would also introduce legislation Tuesday providing criminal penalties for IRS employees who violate the privacy of taxpayers and hoped it would reach the Senate floor for a vote April 15.</p>
<p>Sen. Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican, introduced IRS &quot;file snooping&quot; legislation in February.</p>
<p>Congressional aides said the three measures were not identical but had the same goal of closing a legal loophole.</p>
<p>Currently an IRS employee cannot be convicted of a crime for just unauthorised browsing unless the employee passed on the information to someone else or used the information in a criminal way, a spokesman for Glenn said.</p>
<p>Glenn Tuesday also planned to report statistics on the number of browsing cases and how many employees have been disciplined for abusing their access to confidential taxpayer records.</p>
