<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metals futures ended mixed on Monday in lacklustre trade, with gold ending weaker, following dip in bullion prices last Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium futures were off early lows as short-covering gathered force after the dollar rose against the yen in late Tokyo trade, the traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from two yen to five yen per gram lower. Benchmark February was off five yen at 1,388 yen. Spot gold was quoted at $351.80/352.20 per ounce at 0733 GMT, against $352.00/352.50 in New York on Friday.  </p>
<p>In gold futures, activity was mainly dominated by trade houses' inter-month trade, while most private investors retreated to the sidelines as the bullion market as well as the currency market was basically directionless, the traders said.</p>
<p>Palladium futures opened mostly weaker on Monday, but short-covering by private investors helped four distant months end in positive territory by the close.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese traders were still waiting for information from the Russian export agency of platinum group metals when the Japan-Russia platinum group metals talks for 1997 will be held,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said it was a matter of time until the Russian trade mission came to Japan for export contract talks, although they have not been informed when the talks will be held. Nevertheless, massive short positions still held by private investors may support the market for a while.</p>
<p>Palladium futures ranged from nine yen per gram lower to nine firmer. Benchmark February palladium was up nine yen at 587 yen. Platinum futures ranged from one yen per gram lower to seven yen higher. Benchmark February was up seven at 1,486 yen. Benchmark February silver was down 0.5 yen at 209.1 yen.</p>
