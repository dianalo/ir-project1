<headline>Recent speeches meant to explain policy - Greenspan.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday defended his recent comments about financial markets, saying they were intended to explain monetary policy moves the Fed might undertake in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;What I was trying to do in December and what I did in my Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate the other day was to try to lay out all the various factors which we examine for purposes of monetary policy,&quot; Greenspan said in testimony to the House Budget Committeee.  </p>
<p>Greenspan was referring to a speech in December in which he questioned whether financial markets had become &quot;irrationally exuberant&quot; and also to the first leg of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in which he repeated that question.</p>
<p>In the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Greenspan elaborated further on that remark by warning that the huge run-up in U.S. stock prices over the past two years might not be sustainable.</p>
<p>In laying out the factors the Fed is looking at, Greenpsan said it would help avoid a situation where people might respond to a potential policy move by asking, &quot;Why are we (the Fed) doing this in this particular way?&quot;  </p>
<p>The Fed chief said he was not trying to &quot;jawbone,&quot; or sway the financial markets with his comments.</p>
<p>Given the vast size of the markets, no one person could &quot;affect them in a fundamental way,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
