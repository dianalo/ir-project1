<headline>Mexico stocks off lows but still hit by Greenspan.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks closed sharply lower Friday, but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated.</p>
<p>&quot;It was Greenspan at first. Then once we saw the Dow (Jones industrial average) was not about to crash, some buyers stepped in,&quot; said a trader, referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose comments that assets were &quot;irrationally exhuberant&quot; upset financial markets worldwide.</p>
<p>The blue-chip IPC index ended down 1.29 points, or 43.56 percent, at 3,333.05. Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Mexican stocks were also hurt by U.S. long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in Mexico.</p>
<p>Yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in Mexico, unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 107 stocks changed hands, of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13.</p>
<p>Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers.</p>
<p>Simec, the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden Sidek group headed the losers, off 7 centavos (1 cent) at 1.40 pesos (18 cents). Sidek fell 4 centavos (1 cent) to 95 centavos (12 cents).</p>
<p>Traders also remarked that Mexican ADRs suffered in New York. Heavyweights Telmex and Televisa ended off 25 cents and 75 cents, respectively, at $31.125 and $25.875.</p>
<p>&quot;Falling share prices in New York don't hurt Mexico as long as it happens gradually, as earlier this week. It's a sudden plunge that takes its toll,&quot; said Carlos Ponce, research director at Santander.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on Friday was.</p>
<p>&quot;Some buyers stepped in, but the market was not very convinced. Volume was lackluster,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's very healthy, we're buying,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Ponce said shares were certainly attractively priced in Mexico, but would not appreciate until foreign buyers stepped in, which they had yet to do.'</p>
