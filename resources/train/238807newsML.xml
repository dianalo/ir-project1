<p>Indonesian palm oil exports totalled an estimated 170,000 tonnes in November, compared with 148,000 tonnes in October, traders told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said November crude palm oil output was an estimated 390,000 tonnes, down from 410,000 tonnes in October.  </p>
<p>The traders said there had been an overall drop in production last month because of bad weather, shortage in fertilisers and maturing trees.</p>
<p>&quot;My production for October was 25 percent below budget,&quot; one trader with a plantation house told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a slight improvement in November, but production is still in negative territory,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders also said there was a drop in October production to 410,000 tonnes from some 430,000 tonnes in September.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's certainly going to be no peak this year,&quot; a refiner for plantations in North and Central Sumatra said. &quot;My plantation in North Sumatra saw a drop of 10 percent in October because of bad weather...too much rain.&quot;</p>
<p>An official from a plantation in the key growing region of North Sumatra said his plantation saw a production decline of about three percent to four percent in October.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect a slight turnaround in November and December but it is too early to tell as a lot depends on the weather. Too much rain is not good. At best, there will be a slowdown in the rate of decline in production for November.&quot;  </p>
<p>A Jakarta trader, however, said his plantation saw a 4-5 percent increase in production in October after a &quot;disappointing&quot; September, and added that output was expected to improve in November and December.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there will be a peak (in production) this year because we had a fantastic first semester (first six months) this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An Agriculture Ministry official said he expected output from state plantations to fall by up to 20 percent this year due in part to a fertiliser shortage last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Many of our plantations have been reporting a decline in production until October because of the fertiliser shortage and bad weather,&quot; he said. &quot;But I now hear that production has begun to pick up but I don't have any data yet.&quot;</p>
<p>A senior trader who works for a large plantation house said he expected negative growth in November output, but added that the decrease would be smaller than in October.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that plantations with more mature trees are facing production problems,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Traders said that Indonesian crude palm oil production was expected to touch 4.6-4.7 million tonnes this year, compared with an estimated 4.2 million tonnes last year.</p>
<p>The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association has forecast 1996 production to rise to 4.9 million tonnes due to an expansion in the area under oil palm cultivation and higher yields from maturing trees.</p>
<p>The traders also said that November exports were better than in October especially because of good crude palm oil prices in European markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Many exporters were also rushing to get their crude palm oil shipped out in November because the export tax on crude palm oil in December was expected to be sharply higher than in October,&quot; one exporter said.</p>
<p>Traders expect the tax on crude palm oil to rise to $42-$43 per tonne in December from $28 in November.</p>
<p>The taxes are based on a composite average of international prices in the last two weeks of the previous month.</p>
