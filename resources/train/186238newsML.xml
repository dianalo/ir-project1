<p>Israeli bonds closed higher on Wednesday with demand for unlinked bonds falling for the first time in two weeks, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.08 pct to 169.54</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.12 pct to 170.48</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.20 pct to 166.62</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds (Gilon - issued for four years): +0.05 pct to 169.35.</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.03 pct to 160.08</p>
<p>Volume was low at 122 million shekels with most of the activity concentrated in bonds linked to the consumer price index, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflation-linked long bonds continue to rise. Demand was high today at 270 million shekels as against supply of only 50 million shekels,&quot; said Uri Schur at Eyal Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Long bonds rose 0.18 percent while the short series gained only 0.07 percent,&quot; Gidi Halperin at Meitav Securities and Investments. &quot;Because of the rise (in prices) for the long bonds, yields have fallen from 5.25 percent in August to 4.5 percent. I believe that at the current rate the market will stablilze.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said unlinked bonds rose at a slower pace following a sharp rise over the last two weeks. &quot;After few weeks of heavy activity in unlinked bonds the market has reached an equilibrium,&quot; Schur said.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time in two months we saw a surplus in the leader of two million shekels in the Gilons,&quot; Halperin added.</p>
<p>Makams, which are also unlinked, rose moderately on low turnover of 34 million shekels.</p>
<p>Traders said dollar-linked bonds fell in response to the continued decline of the dollar against the shekel in the local foreign currency market. The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.2340 shekels against 3.2380 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
