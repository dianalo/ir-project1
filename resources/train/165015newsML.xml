<p>Entrail-watching is unedifying. But without briefings on the coalition talks it is in danger of taking over from political analysis.</p>
<p>It is the fate of the press gallery to lurk collectively in the corridors and elevators of power waiting for a phrase, a word, a tilt of the head, that might indicate which way the talks are going.</p>
<p>The most asked question: who will NZ First go with? The only honest answer: I don't know.</p>
<p>That goes for the players too.  </p>
<p>As quickly as you can construct a case, the contradictions spring to mind. Labour makes sense on personal and policy compatibility. National makes sense on fiscal intentions and the background and leanings of key players. Neither makes total sense for the long-term positioning of NZ First nor for the maverick tendencies of its leader Winston Peters.</p>
<p>Forced to rank the options, a NZ First-Labour coalition remains the best bet, followed by a National or Labour minority government.</p>
<p>A full National-NZ First coalition comes a narrow fourth in the betting. But all are in the chase until the race is run.  </p>
<p>As the talks head into their fifth round this week a few themes have emerged to back these impressions. Not least is the late night &quot;informal negotiations&quot; between Labour's Mike Moore and Peters and the clear preference of influential businessman Sir Robert Jones for a Labour-NZ First deal. Jones is a friend of both Peters and Moore.</p>
<p>A full coalition is NZ First's top prize. In the talks it has aimed to nail down all policy details. Insiders say it wants any deal to last for the full three-year term -- as much to get its new MPs up to speed as to give the party time to cement its position in the centre.  </p>
<p>Significantly, NZ First spin doctors have been pressing the media to drop the &quot;nationalist&quot; epithet and replace it with a centrist tag that positions it long-term and makes it more acceptable as a coalition partner for both sides.</p>
<p>Meanwhile National and Labour have been giving NZ First a dream run. Bolger's attacks on Peters, and NZ First's immigration, treaty settlement and foreign investment policies, seem now to have come from an alien planet called pre-election rhetoric.</p>
<p>Labour's more muted criticisms of NZ First policy have become mute altogether.  </p>
<p>That Peters can make a late-night spectacle of the coalition talks by a series of verbal stoushes in a Wellington night spot without a word of criticism from the major parties gives a clue to the delicacy of the talks.</p>
<p>The problems of running a caretaker government have provided further hints -- especially in the row over who should attend APEC and Bolger's lack of consultation with Clark and Peters.</p>
<p>Most telling last week was Labour's appeal to NZ First over the &quot;crisis&quot; of rising state rents.  </p>
<p>Housing Minister Murray McCully had before the election brought NZ First's Tau Henare round to the government's market rental line, albeit with an interim rent freeze. But Labour, armed with horror stories of huge rent rises, has offered to put its income-related rents policy on hold and back NZ First's interim freeze. Clark and Peters' acknowledgement they were cooperating on the issue was the first breach of the secrecy surrounding the talks.</p>
<p>Labour's ploy served to demonstrate its willingness to be flexible and drove a wedge between National and NZ First in a policy area where they are closer than Labour and NZ First.  </p>
<p>National has spotted the dangers and on Monday quickly moved to brief NZ First on housing.</p>
<p>The fact that Labour thinks NZ First's total housing policy is seriously flawed is briefly forgotten. Full compatibility can come later.</p>
<p>Similarly Labour's finance spokesman Michael Cullen is moving to address NZ First's desire for higher national savings without accepting the distortions of its plan for compulsory superannuation. Expect some very creative solutions if a coalition deal finally emerges.  </p>
<p>There are areas where both major parties are treading cautiously to amend without trying to offend. What was well- developed policy for an election campaign is struggling to stand up to the scrutiny required for implementation.</p>
<p>As an obvious example, take the problem of NZ First's policy of free doctors visits and prescriptions for the under 12s. That needs to mesh with the price for such care. Will the state pay whatever GPs charge? Or will doctors face price control?  </p>
<p>While the focus has been on the policy concessions likely to be wrung from Labour and National, no one should lose sight of the policy wringer the NZ First policies are going through in those debugged rooms in Bowen House.</p>
