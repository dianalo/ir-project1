<p>Mexican consumers continued to penny-pinch in the second quarter of the year, in the aftermath of the crushing 1995 recession, suggesting at present a half-cocked recovery, analysts said.</p>
<p>In a review of supply and demand in second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data released on Friday, inventory building and government investment projects carried the economy more than the Mexican shopper.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not firing on all cylinders here. You've still got a fairly fragile situation,&quot; said Denis Parisien, economist at I.D.E.A. in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Those people who are expecting a four to five percent growth rate next year may end up getting disappointed.&quot;</p>
<p>A 7.2 percent rise in second quarter GDP announced last month triggered a wave of optimism that Mexico's economy was fully on the mend after the economic crisis the year before. But that bullishness has been tempered by data since, and analysts say stock prices have suffered as a result.</p>
<p>In Friday's breakdown, Q2 private consumption rose 2.9 percent, a lower-than-expected increase that looks lackluster when compared with the depths of recession in the second quarter of last year, Parisien said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, aggregate supply was up 10.5 percent during the period. &quot;Given that aggregate demand is up so little, you've got a big increase in inventories,&quot; Parisien said.</p>
<p>In the same data in the first quarter, economists had hailed a surprising rebound in consumer demand. That recovery was not borne out by retail sales figures in later months, however, that some economists argued remained sluggish.</p>
<p>&quot;Households and small businesses are still struggling to refinance their debts. There's no discretionary income to go out and spend,&quot; Parisien said.</p>
<p>Helping compensate in the second quarter, economists said, was a sharp increase in government investment spending, that rose 38.4 percent in Q2 compared with the same period a year before. Private investment was up 13.9 percent.</p>
<p>The government pumped money into infrastructure projects in the second quarter, in a bid to grease the wheels of the recovery and help boost employment. But its ability to stoke the economy long-term is considered volatile.</p>
<p>&quot;Taken as a whole (including the 7.2 percent GDP rise), the numbers suggest that the recovery is as strong as we expected, but the underpinnings of demand are somewhat less certain than we expected,&quot; wrote Morgan Stanley economist Ernest Brown in a report on Monday.</p>
<p>He said demand was &quot;based somewhat less on the consumer, and somewhat more on inventory accumulation and government investment spending, both more volatile sources of spending&quot;.</p>
<p>In a cautionary note on the speed of recovery, he cited anecdotal evidence that government investment spending may have fallen sharply in the third quarter from second quarter levels.</p>
<p>He also aired doubts about inventories. &quot;Inventory rebuilding at high levels will have to be continually validated by accelerating consumer and investment spending in coming quarters if this source of demand is to continue.&quot;</p>
<p>Brown, however, stuck by his forecast of estimated growth in 1997 of 4.0 percent. &quot;Mexico's recovery is doing just fine, but the patient isn't out of the woods yet,&quot; he wrote.</p>
