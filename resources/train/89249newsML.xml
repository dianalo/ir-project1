<p>Kashmir's moderate National Conference party swept the first handful of results announced on Tuesday in the troubled Indian state's first local assembly polls in nearly a decade, election officials said.</p>
<p>They said the National Conference had won six seats in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state. The region has been torn by a separatist rebellion that has claimed 20,000 lives since it began in 1990, police and hospital sources say.</p>
<p>The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a seat in the Udhampur district, United News of India said.</p>
<p>The winning candidates said their first priority would be to work towards restoring peace to the state.</p>
<p>&quot;Restoring normalcy is our top priority,&quot; said National Conference's Sadiq Ali, elected from the residential Srinagar area of Zadibal.</p>
<p>&quot;This election is our reply to the Hurriyat leaders,&quot; said Mohammed Shafi Bhat, elected from the central Amirakadal precinct. He was referring to the All-Parties' Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, the umbrella group of separatist parties in the Kashmir valley.</p>
<p>The Hurriyat, whose members demand either self-determination or closer ties to Pakistan, had called for a weekend strike in the state to protest the last phase of polls on Monday.</p>
<p>Former chief minister and leader of the National Conference, Farooq Abdullah, who is widely tipped to be the state's next chief minister, has repeatedly said he will have nothing to do with the separatists.</p>
<p>The National Conference is Kashmir's largest political party.</p>
<p>The counting of votes began on Tuesday, after the final phase of polling, staggered over a month, ended. Election officials said they expected to have most results by Thursday.</p>
<p>Life in the Kashmir valley returned to normal on Tuesday as judges, teachers, bureaucrats and other government employees returned to work after a 38-day strike to protest the polls.</p>
<p>The strike at state-run institutions was called by the Shoura-e-Jehad, a coalition of five Islamic guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>Many shops and businesses had observed only the brief two-day strike called by the separatist Hurriyat during the final phase of polling at the weekend. They did brisk trade as Srinagar residents thronged to stock up on essentials soon after they reopened.</p>
<p>Election officials said early trends showed the National Conference leading in the Charar-e-Sharief constituency, 28 kms (17.5 miles) southwest of Sringar, where a shrine to the state's patron saint was burnt down in May 1995, sparking defiance across the region.</p>
<p>The party was also leading in the constituencies of Handwara, Sopore Lolab, Baramulla and Bandipore in northern Kashmir and in Chaddora in central Kashmir. It was running neck-and-neck with the Indian National Congress in Kupwara on the border and in the holiday resort of Tangmarg.</p>
<p>The National Conference is also ahead in Nobra in Ladakh, and in Batmaloo and Sonawar in Srinagar. But the Congress is leading in Leh, officials said.</p>
