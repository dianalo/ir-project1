<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court finds Britain did enact product liability directive.</title>

<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice dismissed on Thursday a claim by the European Commission that Britain had failed to properly implement the Community's product liability directive.</p>
<p>The court said the Commission did not make its case that Britain did not correctly implement defences to manufacturers' liability.</p>
<p>The directive calls for &quot;a fair apportionment of the risk betwen the injured person and the producer&quot; to allow a producer to prove fault could not have been foreseen.</p>
<p>The Commission argued Britain broadened the defence for manufacturers by converting strict liability into negligence.</p>
<p>The court said that even if the British legislation adopted different wording than the directive, the British law kept the burden of proof on the manufacturer, and rejected a subjective standard as to what is known rather than what should have been known by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Additionally, the court noted the scope of national laws must be assessed in the context of member state court interpretation, and the Commission failed to do so.</p>
