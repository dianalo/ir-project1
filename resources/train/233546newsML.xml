<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British shares dropped on Wednesday, reversing Tuesday's gains as a second day of declines on Wall Street took the steam out of bourses across Europe. The FTSE 100 index closed down 16.3 points at 4,045.2.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German blue-chip shares, coming off an all-time high reached on Tuesday, closed down 0.72 percent as some investors turned to profit-taking in a quiet bourse trading session on Wednesday. The DAX index, which reached a record close of 2,886.98 points on Tuesday, fell 20.91 points to end at 2,866.07 points, showing little movement during the day after shares tumbled in early trade. Later the IBIS DAX, which measures all-day computer trade in the DAX index stood at 2880.89 down 19.87 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - All CAC-40 stocks closed with losses on Wednesday with only Eurotunnel showing a gain and Cie Generale des Eaux unchanged. The index stood at a support level of 2,308 level after pulling back from year highs. Traders said the market needed to take profits before resuming its advance with the goal of regaining the historic high of 2,360.98 points set in 1994. The CAC 40 closed down 40.46 points at 2308.65.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares closed lower after Tuesday's record run amid insecurity about near-term developments on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of nervousness because of New York&quot;, one dealer said, adding that investors were reluctant to take positions as long as the correction on Wall Street seemed to continue. The Blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) lost 13.9 points, or 0.35 percent, to end at 3,910.6. The All-share SPI was down 8.85 points to 2,495.61.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended mixed in directionless trade on Wednesday with the key Nikkei edging up slightly. After an initial dip at the open on Wall Street's losses, buying was limited to selected blue-chip issues, while the recent fall in other issues lost momentum. The key Nikkei 225 average inched up 29.35 points or 0.14 percent to finish at 20,659.91. But its December futures closed 10 points lower at 20,650.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Cautious market sentiment drove Hong Kong stocks to a weaker close, but laggard chasing and bargain-hunting allowed prices to finish off their lows. The Hang Seng index closed with a loss of 22.02 points at 13,434.24, off its intraday low of 13,344.80. Turnover was a busy HK$8.61 billion compared to HK$7.51 billion on Tuesday.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - An active Australian sharemarket slid to a lower close on Wednesday, the market following the Dow down early and quickly settling in about 10 points lower. By the close, the All Ordinaries index lost 9.4 points to stand at 2,370.7.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - A scramble for South African gold shares ensued during the afternoon as the bullion price rose from three-year lows touched on Tuesday and as the rand weakened almost one cent. There was strong local and foreign interest in gold stocks. The gold index added 1.6 percent or 24.1 points to 1,516.5. Industrial shares ended weak for the third consecutive day on Wednesday amid a general lack of direction and a softer rand which ended the day at 4.66 against the dollar. The overall market index was 14.1 points firmer at 6,713.6.</p>
