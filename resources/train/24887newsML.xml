<title>UK: Sharp Wall St drop unsettles European bourses.</title>
<headline>Sharp Wall St drop unsettles European bourses.</headline>

<p>European bourses fell on Friday, weighed down by a sharp drop on Wall Street after strong U.S. economic growth figures rekindled worries of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>The dollar drifted slightly lower against the mark but foreign exchanges were expected to be quiet as U.S. dealers made an early start to the Labour Day weekend. The focus remained on the French franc.</p>
<p>Frankfurt registered the biggest loss by mid-morning after Wall Street closed 1.13 percent down overnight. Investor fears of higher U.S. interest rates were reignited when economic growth data was revised strongly upwards on Thursday.</p>
<p>London, Europe's biggest bourse, slipped 12.0 points to 3,873.0 on the FTSE 100 share index. &quot;It won't be a meltdown and I don't think there will be much business in the U.S. ahead of the holiday weekend,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The drop followed a nearly one percent fall on Thursday in a London market that has been hitting new peaks recently, culminating in a record FTSE close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Investors were looking for more clues on the state of the U.S. economy when Washington releases figures on personal income and spending for July at 1230 GMT and factory orders data at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anyone is going to be too aggressive after yesterday,&quot; said another trader. &quot;I don't think we'll see much until we get those (U.S. jobs) figures out of the way.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to an important U.S. employment report for August due to be published next Friday. Strong figures, taken with Thursday's healthy growth data, could be the impetus for the U.S. central bank to increase interest rates in coming weeks.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt floor trading, the DAX index fell 0.8 percent to 2538.74 points amid gloom because of the hammering on Wall Street overnight and the weaker dollar.</p>
<p>With little corporate news due during the day, and a U.S. holiday on Monday, dealers were pessimistic about any new direction for the market until Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The news from the U.S. set us back. I reckon we will see support today at the 2,530-point level,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>French stocks weathered the bad news better after shedding 1.27 percent on Thursday on worries about the prospect of industrial unrest in the autumn.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index slipped only 3.39 points to 1,974.17 and the franc strengthened to 3.4212 against the mark after hitting a five-month low of 3.4296 against the German currency on Thursday.</p>
<p>A drop of 20,000 in French July unemployment, announced on Friday, and a continuing trade surplus in June, albeit slightly reduced from May, gave some comfort to investors.</p>
<p>The dollar, which perked up on Thursday on the U.S. growth figures, was slightly weaker as the mark continued to strengthen against most European currencies.</p>
<p>Analysts were at a loss to explain the dollar's weakness, which defies the textbooks since it should be rising on expectations of monetary tightening as higher U.S. rates would make assets denominated in dollars relatively more attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's reaction to strong economic data is schizophrenic but it remains vulnerable to upset in the asset markets,&quot; said Ian Amstad, international economist at Bankers Trust in London.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 108.67 yen and 1.4793 marks, compared with 108.50 and 1.4815 in late European business on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS 1100 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was down 12.0 at 3,873.1.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was 21.32 lower at 2,538.74.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 was down 2.65 at 1,974.91.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $387.25 an ounce in the morning, compared with Thursday's close of $388.25. Silver was at $5.19, down three cents.</p>
