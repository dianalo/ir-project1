<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices declined further in early trading on Wednesday due to the absence of buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are falling again because there are no buyers. Traders are ready to sell their rubber at 46.75 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan and at 46.50 fob Palembang for June/July shipment...the problem is no bids have been placed yet by buyers,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Offer prices were quoted at 48.00 fob Medan and at 47.00 fob Palembang on Tuesday. Traders said offer prices fell to 46.25 fob Padang, to 46.625 fob Surabaya and to 46.00 fob Pontianak and Jambi.  </p>
<p>Prices in those four cities were quoted at 47.00 on Tuesday. Traders said stocks were piling up in the market as wintering in a number of key growing areas had started to end.</p>
<p>They said trading was somewhat directionless due to the absence of buyers with some traders still offering rubber at prices above 48.00.</p>
