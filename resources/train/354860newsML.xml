<p>While most expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady in the near term, a recent speech by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan does contain hints that a preemptive tightening could occur as early as this week, economists say.</p>
<p>In his January 21 Senate testimony, Greenspan took the unusual step of quoting verbatim from his own Humphrey-Hawkins testimony of February 1996 -- outlining that the potential for wage-related inflation remains the chief Fed policy concern.  </p>
<p>&quot;Suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point in the future, the trade-off of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end,&quot; Greenspan noted.</p>
<p>Describing the relationship between job insecurity and low wage pressures as &quot;a transitional rather than a lasting phenomenon,&quot; Greenspan cautioned &quot;the recent pickup in some measures of wages suggests that the transition may already be running its course.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fed chairman also pointed out monetary policy acts with a lag -- a reminder of the need for preemptive moves.  </p>
<p>Ken Bercuson, head of research at SBC Warburg, commented &quot;(Greenspan) said the transition may have ran its course. He thinks (low wage inflation is) over.&quot;</p>
<p>Referring to Greenspan's recent testimony, Bercuson noted &quot;the key phrase is about the recent wage indicators,&quot; and &quot;he believes price inflation depends on wage inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>SBC Warburg expected the FOMC to raise the 5.25-percent fed funds rate by 25 basis points after its two-day policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Bercuson said the Fed was willing to take a gamble last year, hoping that the economy would slow down -- a gamble that strong 1996 data have shown the Fed has lost.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs and Co senior economist Ed McKelvey, commenting on labor costs, warned &quot;the horse is out of the barn&quot; and said a February tightening cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Referring to Greenspan's concern about the transitional nature of subdued wage performance, McKelvey pointed out the wages-and-salaries component of the Employment Cost Index stood below 3.0 percent between 1992 and early 1996.  </p>
<p>However, that ECI component rose in 1996 to end the year up 3.3 percent while the jobless rate fell below 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>McKelvey noted &quot;the timing and gradual pace of this pickup imply that the non-accelerating inflation rate of unempoyment (NAIRU) is between 5.5 percent and 6.0 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph Carson, managing director at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, commenting on the January 1996 easing &quot;insurance,&quot; remarked &quot;at mid-year 1996, many of the members wanted to reverse that decision, but Mr. Greenspan kept policy unchanged because he thought there were several reasons why growth would slow. Obviously, he was wrong.&quot;  </p>
<p>Carson who expects a 25-point funds rate hike on Wednesday added that &quot;another reason why the Fed needs to tighten is because the financial markets are no longer doing the Fed's job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is now incumbent on the Fed to practice what it has preached over the last few years, be forward-looking and raise rates before the need for action is evident to the financial markets,&quot; Carson said.</p>
<p>Greenspan also made clear of late that, while the Consumer Price Index likely overstates inflation, this has no implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a (CPI) revision implies faster growth in potential output, as well as actual output. Accordingly, it does not alter the relationship between resource utilization and inflation,&quot; the Fed chairman told the Senate in January.</p>
<p>MFR Inc advisor Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed Staff Director and FOMC Secretary, said the Fed may &quot;vote an asymmetric (policy) directive and do something before Mr. Greenspan testifies.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenspan is due to testify before Congress later this month. The chairman has often used such opportunity in the past to give the nation an in-depth insight into the rationale for Fed policy.</p>
<p>&quot;They were close to a tightening last summer, and then, the statistics got weak. Now, they are unexpectedly strong relative to the forecast, and they are backing into thinking about a tightening again,&quot; Axilrod added.</p>
