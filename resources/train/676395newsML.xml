<p>South Korea's Daewoo Group said it was still keen on bidding for ailing French TV and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia, a company it first tried to buy in 1995 as part of a privatisation that collapsed.</p>
<p>&quot;Daewoo continues (to have) the same interest in participating in the privatisation of Thomson Multimedia as before,&quot; chairman Woo-Choong Kim told reporters at an economic forum hosted by the U.S. Wharton business school.</p>
<p>&quot;We are waiting to hear back from the French government. We hope there will be a way to make a successful arrangement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Daewoo had agreed to buy the money-losing company for the nominal sum of one franc as part of the privatisation of Thomson SA, which owns all of Thomson Multimedia (TMM) and 58 percent of defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>The previous conservative French government said it favoured a bid from Lagardere, a publishing-to-missiles conglomerate which had agreed to sell TMM to Daewoo, over a rival offer for Thomson from Alcatel Alsthom.</p>
<p>But the sale was scrapped after France's privatisation commission objected to the terms, particularly the sale of TMM and its valuable technology for a pittance. The deal's collapse in December 1995 briefly strained ties between Paris and Seoul.</p>
<p>The government then decided to sell Thomson-CSF first and then TMM after injecting more than 10 billion francs ($1.7 billion).</p>
<p>But it was voted out of power on June 1 and the new Socialist-led government is less favourable toward privatisations, although Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has left his options open.</p>
<p>Chairman Woo-Choong Kim said it was too early to tell what the government planned to do with the Thomson group, which lost 3.7 billion francs in 1996. TMM's net loss was 3.1 billion.</p>
<p>Daewoo Electronics Chairman Soon Hoon Bae recently said he saw two ways to restore TMM's profitability.</p>
<p>The first was short-term action involving job cuts, which was not in line with the new government's policies and which also offered no guarantee that TMM would become more competitive against giants like Sony and Philips.</p>
<p>The second was a strategic policy to enable TMM to develop on other markets that would require heavy funding, he said. ($ = 5.823 French Francs)</p>
