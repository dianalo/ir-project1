<p>Mainland Chinese companies hold a combined 90 billion patacas (US$11.27 billion) in assets in Macau, making them the Portuguese-administered enclave's top foreign investor, local media reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Macau Chinese Enterprises Association chairman Zhang Xu Ming was quoted as saying China's more than 200 companies in Macau had a 50 percent share in the territory's finance and insurance business, and up to 70 percent of the tourism business.</p>
<p>Chinese companies also held 30 percent of the import and export trade and 70 percent of the property sector, he said.</p>
<p>Macau's main industries are tourism, gambling, textiles and garment manufacturing.</p>
<p>The association, celebrating its fifth anniversary, comprises Macau-incorporated companies funded by China and joint ventures incorporating Chinese capital.</p>
<p>Marking the anniversary, Wang Qiren, director of the Macau branch of China's Xinhua News Agency, urged the companies to work with all walks of life in Macau during its transition to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Macau, which has been under Portuguese rule since 1557, reverts to China in December 1999. The nearby British colony of Hong Kong is handed back to China at midnight on June 30 this year.</p>
