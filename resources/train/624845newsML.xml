<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The dollar rose against the yen by late Tokyo on Thursday after earlier losses were offset by unexpectedly sluggish Japanese output data, with fears of an early Japanese interest rate rise subsiding, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The data came out much different from economists' forecasts, which quickly took Japanese government bond yields down and pushed the dollar up,&quot; said a European bank dealer.  </p>
<p>The Trade Ministry said Japan's industrial production in April fell a preliminary 0.4 percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis. It fell 0.3 percent in March.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise ranging from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent for April. &quot;The outpout data was too weak,&quot; said a dealer at another European bank in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The dollar jumped against the yen in a knee-jerk reaction to the data, along with a quick decline in the yield of benchmark 182nd government bond which stood at 2.620 percent at 0646 GMT. It earlier rose as high as 2.740 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you made a careful assessment of the economy, such a weak figure was inevitable for April because of the negative impact of the sales tax rise,&quot; said the first bank dealer.</p>
<p>Japanese bond traders, preoccupied about the possibility of an early rise in Japan's interest rates, had been selling bonds heavily, he added. Currency traders who had bet on strong output data had to buy back dollars they had previously sold.</p>
<p>The bank dealer said the dollar was unlikely to make a further recovery unless there were fresh factors or strong U.S. economic statistics. Profit-taking and light exporter sales put a lid on the dollar above 116.50 yen, he added.  </p>
<p>Japanese investors who had refrained from selling dollars on the way down to the recent low of 111.98 yen were willing to sell them above 116.50 yen, said a dealer at a U.S. bank.</p>
<p>He added that the near-term range for the dollar would be 115-117 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar firmed against the mark in line with the dollar's rally against the yen, but it was basically range-bound in Asia amid uncertainty over the single European currency. Talk of a delay in the launch of EMU has capped the dollar's topside, with some dealers here saying that a major U.S. hedge fund bought marks for dollars overnight.  </p>
<p>Germany's powerful Bundesbank and the Bonn government entered open conflict on Wednesday as the central bank rejected Bonn's plans to revalue its assets and the government said it would go ahead regardless. The Bundesbank warned that such a measure could undermine the euro from the start.</p>
<p>If such conflicts contribute to a delay in EMU, there could be a big wave of mark purchases, said one bank dealer in Tokyo. That would probably put downward pressure on the dollar against the yen, he added.</p>
<p>In late afternoon trading, the dollar stood at 116.20/30 yen and 1.7015/20 marks, compared with a late U.S. level on Wednesday of 115.83/88 yen and 1.6950/60 marks.</p>
