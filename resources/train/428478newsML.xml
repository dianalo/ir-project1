<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-WHALERS BLANK CANADIENS IN KEY EASTERN MATCHUP.</headline>
<dateline>HARTFORD, Connecticut 1997-03-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sean Burke stopped 26 shots for his second straight shutout and Steve Chiasson scored in his Hartford debut as the Whalers blanked the Montreal Canadiens 2-0 in a key Eastern Conference matchup Friday.</p>
<p>Robert Kron had the other goal for Hartford, which moved into sole possession of seventh place in the East, two points ahead of Tampa Bay, Washington and Montreal.</p>
<p>&quot;This game was pretty much what we had hoped for,&quot; said Whalers coach Paul Maurice. &quot;It was a high-paced game with a lot of speed and a lot of emotion. I'm pleased with our effort.&quot;</p>
<p>Burke, who blanked Calgary by an identical score on Wednesday, has three shutouts in 14 days and four this season. He made his best save in the final seconds, stopping Mark Recchi from point-blank range.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good game from my perspective,&quot; Burke said. &quot;We didn't make a lot of mistakes. I only had to make a few quality saves each period. Our defence played great tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>Burke made nine saves in the first period, seven in the second and 10 in the third en route to his 14th career shutout.</p>
<p>Jocelyn Thibault finished with 37 saves for the Canadiens, who have lost three of their last four games and four in a row at Hartford.</p>
<p>&quot;Hartford played a good game tonight,&quot; Montreal coach Mario Tremblay said. &quot;They forechecked well, worked hard and closed the middle ice so we didn't have much room to skate and they were really taking the body.&quot;</p>
<p>Chiasson was acquired from Calgary following Wednesday's victory over the Flames.</p>
<p>Hartford played without right wing Kevin Dineen, who was scratched just before gametime with an abdominal strain. The Whalers also lost defencemen Adam Burt and Kevin Haller to strained right shoulders and centre Andrew Cassels to a charleyhorse.</p>
<p>Defenceman Kevin Haller left with what was described as abdominal trauma after he checked Recchi into the boards and caught the Canadien's stick in his stomach.</p>
<p>In Anaheim, Teemu Selanne scored his 40th and 41st goals and set up linemate Paul Kariya's 33rd as the Mighty Ducks extended their unbeaten streak to a record-tying seven games with a 5-2 victory over the New York Rangers.</p>
<p>Ted Drury also had two goals and Steve Rucchin collected three assists for the Ducks, whose 5-0-2 stretch equals the franchise record set last season from March 8-24.</p>
<p>Selanne recorded his second straight two-goal game and has 12 in his last 14 contests. He put Anaheim ahead to stay at 7:03 of the first period when he flicked a short shot past goaltender Mike Richter from the left side.</p>
<p>Selanne also scored into an empty net with 33 seconds to go in the third period.</p>
<p>Adam Graves notched his 200th career goal for the Rangers, who fell to 1-1 on their three-game road trip and are 2-7-2 in their last 11 games overall.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Stars goalie Andy Moog turned aside all 17 shots he faced over the first two periods before leaving with an injury and Greg Adams and Neal Broten scored 38 seconds apart in the first period for a 2-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers.</p>
<p>Arturs Irbe replaced Moog and allowed Mike Grier's goal with 4:13 remaining.</p>
<p>The Stars posted their fifth straight home win and improved to 30-0-1 when leading after two periods.</p>
<p>At Florida, Mike Sullivan scored his first goal in more than a month 5:43 into the third period to snap a tie and Dave Gagner had a pair of tallies as the Calgary Flames defeated the punchless Panthers 3-1.</p>
<p>Dwayne Roloson stopped 27 shots, including all 10 in the third period, to improve to 4-1-1 in his last six starts.</p>
<p>The victory gave the Flames 63 points and moved them into sole possession of seventh place in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>Ray Sheppard scored the lone goal for Florida, which has lost three straight, scoring just one goal in that span. The Panthers are 1-7-1 in their last nine games.</p>
