<p>Bundesbank council member Olaf Sievert said on Tuesday that growth forecasts made earlier in the day by Germany's six leading economic research institutes were realistic.</p>
<p>In a semi-annual report, the six institutes said German gross domestic product was likely to grow 1.5 percent in 1996, rising to 2.5 percent growth in 1997.  </p>
<p>&quot;The research institutes expect gross domestic product growth of 1.5 percent for all of Germany this year,&quot; Sievert said. &quot;That is realistic to me, as is the forecast for next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Sievert, who is head of the Bundesbank's branch in Saxony and Thueringen, said the mood in German industry had improved since the summer, brightened above all by improved demand from abroad.</p>
<p>He also noted that efforts German industry has made to make itself more competitive were starting to pay off.</p>
