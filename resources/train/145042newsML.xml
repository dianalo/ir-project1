<p>China's propaganda chief has called on the nation's journalists to back Communist Party policies and give priority to &quot;positive&quot; reporting, official media said on Friday.</p>
<p>Journalists should also seek greater political awareness, Ding Guangen, head of the party's propaganda department, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Journalists should strengthen political awareness...and resolutely keep conformity with the party central committee with (Communist Party chief) Jiang Zemin at the core,&quot; Ding told a media conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It is necessary to put a resolute and correct political orientation in the first place (and) firmly conduct correct guidance in public opinion,&quot; the People's Daily reported him as saying.</p>
<p>China's Communist rulers keep a tight grip on the media, which it views as a propaganda tool that must serve party interests.</p>
<p>The party held its annual plenum earlier this month and called for a return to basic socialist values that have been eroded by market-oriented reforms.</p>
<p>It lashed out at corruption and &quot;money worshipping&quot; and called for the official media to help in the campaign to stamp out these evils.</p>
<p>Ding called on journalists to adhere to the party's basic line and principles and to give priority to positive propaganda, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;Media work should, while taking economic construction as the central task, have the overall interests of the party and the people in mind,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ding also praised the media for &quot;having created a sound atmosphere for the promotion of socialist cultural and ethical progress&quot;.</p>
