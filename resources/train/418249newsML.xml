<title>BELGIUM: EU prepares report on copper, materials recycling.</title>
<headline>EU prepares report on copper, materials recycling.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Commission is preparing a report on the recycling of copper and other materials, Vicente Leoz, an official in the Commission's Directorate-General III (Industry), said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Leoz told a world conference on copper recycling that until now the issue had been dealt with by environmental experts who tended to believe in the use of regulatory rather than market measures.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the important objectives of this communication is to convince these people that insofar as markets can function properly, they are the most efficient way to reach even environmental objectives,&quot; he said in a speech.</p>
<p>Leoz was addressing the second day of a conference organised by the Lisbon-based International Copper Study Group.</p>
<p>The report, which is expected to be completed later this year, will identify key factors to ensure that recycling is cost competitive.</p>
<p>Recycling is under pressure from the increasing cost of materials collection and waste treatment, he said, adding that technical factors, such as a lack of industrial standards for recovered materials, were also a problem.</p>
<p>EU legislation on wastes is considered by industry as too complex and is imperfectly applied by member states.</p>
<p>The Commission is likely to propose to group industrialists, national governments and EU experts in a &quot;Forum for recycling&quot; to identify weaknesses in the recycling market, promote investment and make recycling more competitive.</p>
<p>It would report to the Commission within 12 months, giving an opinion on a Centre for Recycling to promote the sector.</p>
