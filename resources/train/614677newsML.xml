<p>The won closed weaker versus the dollar on Monday as the central bank of Korea was rumoured to have intervened in the interbank market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The bank, following routine, declined to confirm the action.</p>
<p>The local unit closed at 891.70 against Friday's closing of 890.90. It moved in a range of 890.50 to 892.00.</p>
<p>Dealers said the bank was rumoured to have bought dollars at around 890.60 won in late morning and again at 891.10 in the afternoon.  </p>
<p>The central bank was also suspected of having purchased dollars in three-month forward trading, they said.</p>
<p>The won, otherwise, would have been strong on expected month-end export negotiations, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar was expected to remain flat at the 890 level today. However, the intervention rumours took the dollar higher than expected,&quot; said one local dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers saw the base mid-rate at 891.30 for Tuesday against 891.00 for Monday.</p>
