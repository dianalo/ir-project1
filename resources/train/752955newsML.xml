<p>A move by Spain's Telefonica to buy a stake in Antena 3 television channel with its accompanying soccer viewing rights is seen as strategically important without being too costly, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The telecoms provider, which is launching a digital TV platform in September, said it would acquire 25 percent of Antena 3 and a majority stake in a related company that holds key television rights for soccer matches.</p>
<p>Telefonica said Spanish banks Santander and BCH, financial partners of Antena 3 de Television SA, would acquire a further 18.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We weigh the operation as good because the purchase of Antena 3 was the necessary condition to have access to soccer rights,&quot; said an analyst at a foreign bank in Madrid.</p>
<p>But some foreign investors said the deal, the latest twist in a highly political battle for control of Spain's pay TV market, raised doubts about Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's commitment to making the country investor friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a very big investment for Telefonica but that's not the issue...The issue isn't the investment side but the credibility side,&quot; one analyst at a foreign brokerage said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly underhanded and it smells horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, Telefonica will take control of Antena 3 and 49 percent of GMA, which in turn owns 40 percent of Antena 3 unit Audiovisual Sport.</p>
<p>Together with Televio de Catalunya and Sogecable, Audiovisual Sport controls the rights to Spain's lucrative football broadcasting.</p>
<p>Soccer rights, seen as critical to making digital television profitable, have been at the centre of a dogfight that has pitted Aznar's government and the opposition Socialist party and their supporting media groups against each other for months.</p>
<p>The war heated up late last year when Antena 3 defected from the government-backed Telefonica to the rival digital platform, CanalSatellite, dragging its lucrative soccer rights with it.</p>
<p>The new Socialist party leader Joaquin Almunia was quick to criticise the Telefonica/Antena 3 deal.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a new phase in the operation of abuse of power, of authority, of political comportment near the government which is inappropriate in a democratic country,&quot; he said in remarks to a local radio station.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Miguel Angel Rodriguez said it was a business matter and refused to comment, saying it was premature to talk about a deal that was not yet finalised.</p>
<p>The European Commission stepped into the fray on Wednesday and ordered the government to change a law on pay TV decoders that had favoured Telefonica's digital television platform over competitor CanalSatellite.</p>
<p>With the Antena 3 deal, analysts said Telefonica would wrest control of soccer rights back from CanalSatellite -- a joint venture between France's Canal Plus and Spanish media group Prisa.</p>
<p>Analysts say Telefonica's investment is insignificant for the telecoms firm compared to the importance of the soccer rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Strategically it has been the only possibility for Telefonica's digital platform to have access to the soccer rights and economically the operation does not seem too expensive,&quot; an analyst at a Madrid bank said.</p>
<p>Telefonica said it had not yet agreed how much it would pay for its 25 percent stake. But telecommunications sources said it would be in the region of 21 billion pesetas.</p>
<p>Telefonica said Antena 3 had been valued at around 95 billion pesetas. The channel had a turnover of 64 billion pesetas last year and a net profit of 5.16 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;With these terms, Telefonica pays a (price to earnings ratio) of 20 to enter in Antena 3, the normal ratio for this type of acquisition,&quot; the Madrid bank analyst said.</p>
