<p>Philippine Stock Exchange president Vitaliano Nanagas said late on Wednesday he had urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to temporarily suspend the effectivity of the new system of distributing initial public offerings (IPOs).</p>
<p>He said certain points needed to be clarified first. Moreover, a mutually acceptable system would have to be developed first with the PSE, Investment Houses Association of the Philippines and other market participants.</p>
<p>SEC chairman Perfecto Yasay issued a memorandum on Monday requiring brokers to get their IPO allocations from underwriters, and not from the PSE.</p>
<p>Moreover, Yasay said brokers cannot purchase shares for their own account if it is a &quot;hot&quot; issue. But in case of a &quot;cold&quot; issue, brokers will have to buy them for their own account, he said.</p>
<p>In his letter to Yasay, Nanagas said the SEC would have to further clarify the definition of a &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Would an issue be considered as 'hot' even if, after initially trading at a premium above the IPO price, it subsequently trades at a price below the IPO price before the issue is listed,&quot; Nanagas said in his letter.</p>
<p>Brokers had complained the new system would not ensure wider distribution of an IPO because it would remove the benefit of tapping the 177 active members of the exchange. It is also disadvantageous to brokers with no underwriting or investment house affiliations.</p>
