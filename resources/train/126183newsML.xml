<p>London cocoa futures ignored a healthy rise in the third quarter U.S. grind and sank under the weight of a robust sterling on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is 130 stg higher than this time last year. It's a phenomenal price for the origins,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The benchmark March contract tumbled to 983 stg, a technically-critical area, but saw a good dose of support there and recovered to close at 986 stg a tonne, down 14 stg on the day.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast has been selling constantly this week taking advantage of sterling's advances against other European currencies including the French franc, to which the Ivorian unit is linked.</p>
<p>Nigeria and Cameroon were also reported to be active sellers on Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. grind rose 7.52 percent from the same year-ago period to 93,933 tonnes and while the rise seemed within expectations ranging from a rise of three to 10 percent, New York traders said recent gains had been in anticipation of a rise at the top end of the range.</p>
<p>&quot;New York has rallied amazingly for four days anyway. So now they ignored it,&quot; said one London trader. A mixture of speculative liquidation and technical correction was cited behind the New York losses on Friday, which traders said dragged London lower in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Technical analysts had been expecting a revisit of the low in September of 985 stg basis March to confirm support.</p>
<p>Turnover totalled a fair 5,317 lots and on the switches March/March traded at 62 stg and May/May at 62-63 stg.</p>
<p>Players will be watching out for arrival news from Ivory Coast and Ghana next week to shed light on the potential size of the West African crop, expected to be quite healthy.</p>
<p>One fundamental development was in the chocolate market as the U.S. producer Hershey Foods and Finnish confectionery and packaging group Huhtamaki Oy sealed a deal to take over each other's American and European operations.</p>
<p>But Huhtamaki will retain its big U.S. brand names on which Hershey will pay royalties.</p>
<p>Technical resistance in London basis March is pegged at 1,000 stg, followed by the key 1,025 barrier.</p>
