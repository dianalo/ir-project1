<p>An armoured vehicle blew up outside the house of the most senior Taleban leader in Kabul early on Tuesday, shattering windows up to a block away, but there were no reports of casualties.</p>
<p>The Soviet-built armoured personnel carrier (APC) was parked outside the house of Mullah Mohammed Hassan, deputy leader of the ruling Taleban council in Kabul.</p>
<p>In the absence of council leader Mullah Mohammed Rabbani, Mullah Hassan is the most senior member of the Taleban in the capital.</p>
<p>Mullah Hassan's house is in the Shar-e-Now district in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>It was not possible to determine the cause of the explosion, but people working in the area said that a limpet mine had been attached to the rear of the APC during the night.</p>
<p>Heavily-armed Taleban fighters, who discouraged journalists from lingering at the scene of the explosion, said it had been caused by a careless guard smoking close to the fully-loaded APC. They said the guard survived.</p>
<p>Local residents said the vehicle exploded just before 6 a.m. (0130 GMT).</p>
<p>The explosion blew a hole in the back of the APC and shattered windows a block away. Hassan's house is opposite the offices of the United Nation's Habitat agency. All the windows facing the explosion were blown out.</p>
<p>If the explosion was caused by a limpet mine, it would be the first example of sabotage in the city since it fell to the Taleban in late September.</p>
<p>Sabotage was a popular weapon of the Afghan mujahideen during their war against 1979-1989 Soviet rule. Infiltrators planted explosives in communist commanders' cars and pushed bombs through letterboxes.</p>
<p>Many people in Kabul feared the Taleban's reaction to Tuesday's explosion.</p>
<p>Rumours have been circulating in Kabul about roundups of members of ethnic and tribal groups closely associated with the former government.</p>
<p>&quot;I am frightened that this will lead to more people being rounded up and accused of being saboteurs,&quot; said one man who belonged to the same tribe as the former government's top military commander, Ahmed Shah Masood.</p>
<p>The man declined to give his name.</p>
<p>The Taleban are fighting forces of the ousted government and their allies on front lines some 20 to 25 km (15 to 20 miles) north of Kabul and in the remote northwestern province of Badghis.</p>
<p>A recent report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said that fighting in Badghis had intensified. In a press release the UNHCR said that as many as 50,000 people had been displaced by the fighting.</p>
