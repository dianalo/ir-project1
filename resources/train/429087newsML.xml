<p>Bulgaria will restructure an unused World Bank credit line and use about $30 million to buy grain to help cover its wheat shortage, Agriculture Minister Roumen Hristov said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in an interview agreement on the credit meant Bulgaria now needed only about 70,000 tonnes to cover the gap until the next harvest, which he expected could be negotiated from Hungary, Germany or Romania.</p>
<p>He said he expected to buy about 170,000 tonnes of grain with the credit and hoped deliveries could start by mid-May.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's interim cabinet which took office on February 13 inherited an acute grain shortage after uncontrolled exports two years ago depleted supplies. A poor harvest last year was attributed to bad weather and a lack of cash for fertilisers.</p>
<p>The cabinet said last month it needed 450,000 tonnes to meet demand until the next harvest. Poland agreed to supply 100,000 tonnes of wheat against exports of the same amount from the new crop.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has granted tenders to Swiss firm Glencore and Bulgaria's Nada to supply 100,000 tonnes against forward contracts to export 134,000 tonnes from the new crop.</p>
<p>Hristov said these volumes, plus 35,000 tonnes from the new crop which have been bartered for combine harvesters, were the maximum Bulgaria could afford to contract without creating fresh shortages.</p>
<p>He said the World Bank credit meant Bulgaria would probably not now need to conclude a deal it had been negotiating under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's GSM-102 export credit guarantee programme.</p>
<p>Bulgaria is also negotiating to receive 50,000 tonnes from Hungary, and Hristov will visit Germany on Monday and Tuesday for talks with Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert.</p>
<p>Hristov said he was less optimistic on a proposal to import grain from Kazakhstan in exchange for forgiveness of its debt to Bulgaria, as transport costs would be very high.</p>
<p>He said prices of grain, flour and bread would be gradually liberalised but the process would have to ensure a safety net for the poorest Bulgarians.</p>
<p>&quot;A big problem for Bulgaria and for this government is that we inherited empty granaries and an empty budget,&quot; said Hristov. The interim cabinet will govern until after elections on April 19 called after the former Socialist government was toppled by protests fuelled by economic hardship.</p>
<p>&quot;We will secure the winter crop and the spring sowing to ensure the incoming government does not suffer a grain crisis,&quot; Hristov said.</p>
<p>He said he had been disappointed by the response of western European countries to Bulgaria's appeals for immediate aid. &quot;The fastest and most useful solution for Bulgaria really came from Poland,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Evaluation missions from the United Nations and the European Union just took a lot of time and held a lot of talks. I felt the only way to convince them was to show them the bread queues, empty shelves and people collapsing from hunger.&quot;</p>
<p>Donors have been hesitant at putting more money into a country where large sums were siphoned abroad under the previous administration.</p>
<p>Hristov said the state contingency reserves were usually around 100,000 tonnes, though the interim government had inherited less than that.</p>
<p>The cabinet released 21,400 tonnes from the reserves last month, and Hristov said it would be replaced by a smaller amount because of the difference between the internal price in Bulgaria and the price on world markets.</p>
<p>The state also holds a separate war reserve, which Hristov said would not be touched. He said the amount was confidential. -- Sofia Newsroom +359-2 981 8569</p>
