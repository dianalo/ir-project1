<p>U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said he expected the oil-for-food deal with Iraq to be renewed another six months in June.</p>
<p>Annan, speaking to a news conference in Geneva, also said he expected Baghdad to cooperate fully with U.N. inspectors overseeing Iraq's scrapping of its weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>&quot;My expectation is now that we are beginning the scheme, it will continue to be extended another six months,&quot; Annan said. &quot;My sense is it will be extended for another six months barring unforeseen circumstances.&quot;  </p>
<p>The United Nations gave Iraq clearance in December for limited exports under an &quot;oil-for-food&quot; deal to buy relief aid for Iraqis suffering under economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Under the renewable six-month deal, Iraq can sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months.</p>
<p>Annan said he expected there still to be need for food and medicine for civilians after the current limited deal expires.  </p>
<p>&quot;The need that necessitated the passage of the resolution and the assistance that we are trying to give to the people of Iraq will still be necessary,&quot; Annan told the press conference.</p>
<p>The U.N. chief said that it was clear what was expected of Iraq under resolution 687 and that Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the Special Commission for the Disarmament of Iraq (UNSCOM), had pressed the point with Iraqi officials.</p>
<p>&quot;The expectation is that they will cooperate fully with the inspectors and work with them in destroying the weapons which are still in the country,&quot; Annan said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they cooperate and provide all the evidence and allow them to destroy the weapons or take some of them -- take the necessary material out for analysis, that sort of thing -- I think the (Security) Council will react appropriately,&quot; Annan said.</p>
