<p>An ammonia gas leak in a meat-packing plant just before quitting time on Friday sent 10 plant employees and five firefighters to the hospital, Montreal police said.</p>
<p>The victims were treated for burns and breathing problems after a pipe in a refrigeration unit at the Montpak Ltd. plant broke around 5 p.m. EST, Constable Bernard Perrier said.</p>
<p>Plant workers became aware of the leak after they heard a muffled explosion and saw some colleagues fall over, Perrier said.</p>
<p>Victims were laid on the street outside the plant and given oxygen as about 18 ambulances rushed to the scene.</p>
<p>The plant, which employs about 100, is located in a semi-residential area of Montreal's mainly French-speaking east end, not far from the Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>Firefighters who arrived on the scene early were unprepared for the burning, toxic gas, which leaked into an area near the fire escape stairway, Perrier said. Those who arrived later wore hazardous waste suits and were able to seal off the plant.</p>
<p>Authorities were investigating the reason for the break.</p>
