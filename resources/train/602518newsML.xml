<p>Worldwide Leisure Corp said it is prepared to acquire 80 percent of the stock of Total World TeleCommunications Inc for $33 million.</p>
<p>Worldwide said it would buy 80 percent of Total's stock for $11 million in cash and at least 11 million shares of Worldwide, or at least 22 million shares of Worldwide stock. Both offers are valued at least $33 million, said the company.</p>
<p>&quot;We have spoken to management of Total World, and they are prepared to cooperate with WWLC in such an offer, following appropriate review, and look forward to an early meeting,&quot; said Worldwide chief executive George Pappas.  </p>
<p>The acquisition is the second announced by Worldwide in the last 35 days, it said. Last month, the company said it would acquire American Western Cos, a non-traditional healthcare insurer. Also pending is an acquisition of Thessaliki Spirit Co, a Greek maker of wine and spirits.</p>
<p>On the Total deal, Pappas said, &quot;This proposed acquisition would be the biggest step we have taken to date in our aggressive plan to build a diversified multi-national company with interests in a variety of high-growth industries.&quot;</p>
<p>Worldwide, based in Minneapolis, said it is &quot;building a portfolio of interests in domestic and international companies with the intention of becoming active in the resort and casino and related industries.&quot;</p>
