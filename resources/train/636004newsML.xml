<p>Romania's sports minister urged Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea to take over an inquiry into the financial affairs of the country's soccer federation on Wednesday, saying sports officials were blocking the probe.</p>
<p>Sorin Stanescu said the federation (FRF) had refused to allow sports ministry officials to proceed with the inquiry into allegations that it had collected large sums of money from transfer fees of players going abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;I informed Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea about the soccer federation's refusal to allow in the past months our checks aimed at shedding light on financial deals struck since the (1989) fall of Communism,&quot; Stanescu said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;By rejecting all control by the ministry, the soccer federation is denying the very authority of the state. The control is now more necessary than ever before.&quot;</p>
<p>Ciorbea was attending a cabinet meeting on Wednesday and his office declined comment on what steps might be taken.</p>
<p>The sports ministry ordered the investigation after seven Romanian clubs -- including Steaua Bucharest and Universitatea Craiova -- accused the FRF of siphoning off 10 percent of foreign transfer fees over the past seven years.</p>
<p>Steaua President Marcel Puscas said earlier this year his club was demanding reimbursement of $920,000 &quot;illegally paid to the FRF in the last three years&quot;.</p>
<p>The sports ministry said it was also seeking the return of a portion of the money it said was owed under post-communist legislation.</p>
<p>Ministry inspectors had begun examination of FRF documents but the Federation last week abruptly announced it would no longer co-operate with the inquiry.</p>
<p>Federation officials have insisted that the ministry has no jurisdiction over its affairs and say they are responsible solely to the international soccer bodies FIFA and UEFA.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sports Ministry has no right of control over the national soccer federation which is a private grouping of clubs,&quot; FRF President Mircea Sandu said on television last week.</p>
