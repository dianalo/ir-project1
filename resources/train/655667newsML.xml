<p>Lithuania's central bank said on Thursday that its board decided to suspend the powers of the chairman of Tauras Bank and to remove the bank's board.</p>
<p>The statement also said that it imposed a temporary ban on some of the troubled bank's activities.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was decided to ban Tauras Bank, untill July 12, from carrying out the following banking operations: to accept deposits, issue financial guarantees, and deal with government T-bills,&quot; the central bank said.</p>
<p>The central bank also banned Tauras from conducting transactions with foreign currencies, buying or selling precious metals, issuing payment documents, and managing individual loans, the statement said.</p>
<p>The central bank also recomended the appointment of a new board as soon as possibile to deal with the bank's urgent problems, the statement added.</p>
<p>&quot;The supervision department of the Bank of Lithuania was empowered to audit the financial situation of Tauras Bank,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Tauras Bank confirmed last month that it was facing liquidity problems and borrowed around 14 million litas from the Bank of Lithuania.</p>
<p>Tauras was pinning its hopes on an upcoming share issue of 40 million litas.</p>
<p>The share capital of Tauras Bank is 36 million litas and its assets at the end of April were 187.2 million litas.</p>
<p>Its deposits and letters of credit were 126.2 million litas at the end of April.</p>
<p>The central bank said that Tauras's problems would not ripple through the rest of the sector, which was shaken in late 1995 by a severe crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the banking system will not be affected by Tauras Bank's problems, since the bank is not very big and today's decision was no surprise to financial markets,&quot; said Gitanas Nauseda, the head of the Bank of Lithuania's policy department.</p>
