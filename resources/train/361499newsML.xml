<p>Novartis Agro GmbH expects permission soon to supply gene-altered maize seeds to the European market now that France has cleared such products for sale, company spokesman Joerg Albrecht said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The French move legalises imports of genetically altered maize, now gene-altered maize seeds need to be made registered varieties,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting this to happen very soon in France and Spain and inclusion in the list of EU registered varieties would be the next step.&quot;</p>
<p>The French farm ministry this week authorised the marketing of maize genetically adapted by the Swiss firm Ciba Geigy to resist the corn borer pest.</p>
<p>Formed last year when Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz AG merged into the worldwide Swiss Novartis group, Novartis Agro is one of eight firms within life sciences company Novartis Deutschland.</p>
<p>Gene maize is already grown in the U.S., and its registration in Europe could take two months, Albrecht said. That would mean seeds arriving late into the 1997 March/April European planting season, but not too late to test their performance.</p>
<p>France, where the demand to allow transgenic maize on the EU market arose, made its decision on the basis of mandatory labelling of gene-altered organisms and derived products.</p>
<p>Novartis Seeds GmbH would sell the Ciba maize in Germany. Albrecht said he hoped that farmers in Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and southern Hesse, where the corn borer was most damaging, would recognise its advantages.</p>
<p>Novartis was in contact with environmental group Greenpeace, which opposes gene- altered maize on the grounds it could harm human health and which has vowed to fight cultivation after an unsuccessful attempt to stop imports from the U.S.</p>
<p>Albrecht said, &quot;We don't need to hide our maize, it is a good product, we will label the seeds and we respect consumers' wish to opt for or against it.&quot;</p>
<p>Novartis also respected German farm union DBV's calls for the separate planting and handling of genetically modified and traditional maize, although this might not be possible under current farm practices.</p>
<p>Novartis had scheduled discussions with legislators, scientists, farmers, consumers in the starch industry and the grain and feeds trade in order to gain acceptance for gene-altered maize.</p>
<p>Novartis was the first firm, but not alone, in seeking approval for corn borer resistant maize in Europe.</p>
<p>In the U.S., at least two Ciba competitors were expected to be given approval for 1997/98 sales after gene maize accounted for just 0.5 percent of the total 1996/97 crop area.</p>
<p>Ciba maize cost about 20 percent more than good quality non-modified maize in the U.S., and the price in Europe was also set to be 20 to 25 percent higher.</p>
<p>&quot;But farmers will begin to save money on the basis of an anticipated five to 10 percent borer pest occurrence, and relatively more if the pest is more widespread,&quot; Albrecht said.</p>
<p>Sales opportunities in Germany were modest compared with southern European countries. Germany grows just 2.9 million tonnes of maize a year.</p>
