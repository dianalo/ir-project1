<p>Reed Elsevier said on Monday it was spending $447 million of its own cash to buy U.S. trade magazine publisher Chilton Business Corp from Walt Disney Co unit ABC Inc.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Dutch publishing group said the deal, its second major U.S. acquisition this year, would immediately contribute to its profits. Reed-Elsevier bought MDL Information Systems Inc. by the Anglo-Dutch group's scientific publishing division for $320 million earlier this year.</p>
<p>Chilton, based in Radnor Pennsylvania, made a pre-tax profit of $28 million in 1996 on sales of $203 million. Since 1992, it has achieved compound growth of pre-tax profits of 17 percent.</p>
<p>It publishes 39 business magazine titles, focusing on manufacturing, entertainment and automotive topics.</p>
<p>Reed-Elsevier said it would merge the core Chilton trade press business with its own U.S. business magazines unit, Cahners Publishing Co, which has a stable of over 90 titles.</p>
<p>Chilton's trade exhibitions unit, PEMCO, will become part of Reed Exhibitions.</p>
<p>Reed-Elsevier quoted its co-chairman Nigel Stapleton as saying Chilton was an ideal match for Cahners.</p>
<p>&quot;Chilton fits superbly...and this acquisition offers attractive opportunities for revenue growth and operational synergies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Group strategy director Peter van Hooff told Reuters combining Chilton and Cahners, Reed-Elsevier could raise its U.S. business-to-business publishing operating profit margins to around 20 percent in 1999 from some 15 to 17 percent now.</p>
<p>Van Hooff said the deal would significantly strengthen Reed Elsevier's U.S. trade magazine publishing business, providing plenty of scope to raise revenues and cut costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The combination of Cahners and Chilton gives us even stronger positions in more markets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Van Hooff said Reed-Elsevier would benefit from eliminating overlap between previously competing titles and making them more complementary. Avertising sales forces could be merged and combined rate cards could be offered to advertisers.</p>
<p>Van Hooff said Chilton's magazines would also broaden and deepen editorial content, which Reed-Elsevier could offer via electronic publishing platforms. The Chilton titles did not previously have their own electronic outlet.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chilton titles will really benefit from the lead we have in electronic publishing,&quot; Van Hooff said.</p>
<p>Van Hooff said Reed-Elsevier, which publishes the U.S. showbusiness newspaper Variety, had already been working on plans to develop an online news and information service for the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Chilton's entertainment titles would add further momentum to this project, he said.</p>
