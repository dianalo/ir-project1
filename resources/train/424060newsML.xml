<p>The Agriculture Department Thursday announced the recipients of $90 million in funding for a controverisal agricultural promotion programme and said it was continuing its shift from big business to small and medium-sized companies and producer cooperatives.</p>
<p>Sixty-four trade groups representing products ranging from mohair and Kentucky bourbon to Midwestern corn and California pistachios were allocated lump sums from $42,000 to over $9 million to promote their products overseas through the agency's so-called Market Access Programme.</p>
<p>The biggest recipient of the programme funds was the Cotton Council International, which was allocated $9,261,438.</p>
<p>Other big recipients were the U.S. Meat Export Federation, with $8,498,273 in allocations, American Forest &amp; Paper Association, $6,280,192, and the Florida Department of Citrus, which received $4,247,525.</p>
<p>The programme has come under fire in recent years for allocating money in the past to major corporations such as Seagram Co. Ltd, the Canadian beverage and entertainment giant; the huge Arkansas-based poultry processor Tyson Foods, and Hershey Foods, the top U.S. chocolate maker, among others.</p>
<p>In a celebrated case in the early 1990s, the department allocated funding to the USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, which in turn used the money to develop a joint programme with fast food giant McDonald's to promote Chicken McNuggets in Asia.</p>
<p>Congress severely criticised the programme because of the McDonald's connection and said taxpayer money was needlessly going to huge profitable corporations. As a result, funding for the programme was sharply decreased in the mid 1990s from its high of $200 million in 1992 to the current $90 million annual cap.</p>
<p>In 1996, the department cut funding to large companies by 35 percent in response to the criticism, and the 1997 allocations reflect another 45 percent cut for large concerns. Funding to big companies will be completely eliminated next year, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Beginning in 1998, the entire focus of this proven ... legal export expansion tool will be to assist small and medium-sized U.S. food companies, cooperatives and exporters to capitalise on global market opportunities,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>The programme is a cost-share programme under which the government provides a portion of the funding and companies then provide matching funds of a certain percentage, ranging from at least 10 percent to over 50 percent.</p>
