<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks end flat after rebound from profit-taking.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks end flat after rebound from profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY</dateline>

<p>Mexican stocks recouped earlier losses to close  almost flat on Friday, but well above the landmark 5,000-point barrier,  as bargain-hunters were inspired by a similar recovery on Wall Street  and shifted funds to Mexico from Brazil.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended down 0.8 point, or 0.02 percent,  at 5,067.03.</p>
<p>A surge in the benchmark U.S. 30-year Treasury bond spurred investors  to take profits from record gains chalked up on Thursday and pushed  the IPC down as low as 4,981.85 in early trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Two elements were at work today, profit-taking or consolidation,  and the long bond, but mainly the latter,&quot; said Feliz Boni, research  head at ING-Barings in Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall was cushioned because long bond yields are still relatively  low, and there were signs of funds transferring to Mexico from Brazil,&quot;  he added.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of most active stocks traded in Sao Paulo dived  4.76 percent to close at 12,259. Brokerage Salomon Brothers meanwhile  cut its recommended portfolio weighting for Brazil, while raising  Mexico.</p>
<p>Dealers said market heavyweights Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) and  Grupo Carso were pace-setters for the bourse, both ending unchanged  after recovering from profit-taking.</p>
<p>Telecommunications firm Telmex ended at 21.60 pesos ($2.76) while  conglomerate Carso closed at 62.40 pesos ($7.96).</p>
<p>Dealers pointed to a strong performance by construction companies  and some cement stocks.</p>
<p>The stocks gained on speculation that a government scheme to restructure  highway concession debts was imminent.</p>
<p>Construction firm Empresas ICA gained 70 centavos (9 cents) to 24.70  pesos ($3.15), while cement maker Cemex climbed 1.00 (13 cents) peso  to 40.20 pesos ($5.13).</p>
<p>Trading volume was brisk at 159.1 million shares, even after allowing  for one cross trade which accounted for 47 million shares.</p>
<p>On the broad market, sliders outpaced gainers by 45 to 50, out of  a total of 120 stocks traded.</p>
