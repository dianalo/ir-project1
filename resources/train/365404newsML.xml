<title>FRANCE: Shell to cut capacity at Berre refinery.</title>
<headline>Shell to cut capacity at Berre refinery.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-08</dateline>

<p>Shell France, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said on Saturday that it planned to reduce capacity at its Berre refinery in southeast France as part of a restructuring plan to improve its European refining sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Shell France is now seeking formal approval from the Ministry of Industry to reduce crude throughput at Berre from 6.5 million tonnes per year to 3.5 million tonnes per year, and to take out of operation one of its two catcrackers,&quot; Shell France said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of the reduction in capacity, Shell's refining assets at Berre will be written down,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Shell said in December that it was in talks with three of its competitors operating near the port of Marseilles, Esso France, Total and BP France, on plans to cooperate in reducing capacity.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Shell declined to comment on the negotiations with other oil companies.</p>
<p>European refiners last year announced closures, mergers or cutbacks at plants in Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands after profit margins slumped in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that the continued operation of the refinery with this reduced throughput represents the best solution currently available and provides the company with the greatest flexibility for the future,&quot; Shell France chairman Hugues du Rouret was quoted as saying in the statement.</p>
<p>Du Rouret said contractual obligations to customers for products supply would be met and feedstocks for current and future chemicals operations at the site would be secured.</p>
<p>&quot;With the benefit of further additional performance improvements, this new mode of operation will enable us to have a cash operation in the future,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The Shell spokeswoman said the new mode of operation was scheduled to be put into place during 1998.</p>
<p>Management will meet with staff representatives, unions and other parties to discuss the implications for staff, Shell said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is premature to announce any staff reduction figures,&quot; the spokeswoman told Reuters. She said the refinery employs around 2,000 workers.</p>
<p>The French newspaper Le Figaro said on Saturday that the cutback could entail 100 to 150 job cuts.</p>
