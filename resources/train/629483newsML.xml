<title>SWITZERLAND: No sign of Mexico economy overheating -- Mancera.</title>
<headline>No sign of Mexico economy overheating -- Mancera.</headline>

<p>Mexican central bank governor Miguel Mancera said on Sunday there were no signs Mexico's economy was overheating, adding that 1997 inflation was shaping up in line with official expectations at 15 percent.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters Financial Television, Mancera defended the central bank's monetary policy, which he described as &quot;neutral, not restrictive or expansionary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are no signs at all of overheating, of inflation going beyond what was expected,&quot; said Mancera, who is attending a banking conference.  </p>
<p>The governor said the greatest challenge facing the bank was to ensure that inflation kept falling year after year until it reached a level similar to that of the industrialised countries.</p>
<p>At present, the 15 percent forecast level for the 12 months to December was &quot;not too high,&quot; but the aim was to get it down to single digits, and it &quot;might be something like seven percent&quot; by the year 2000.  </p>
<p>He said recent money supply growth in Mexico, which some critics have seen as risking higher inflation, was due mainly to factors such as increasing gross domestic product and lower interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;We are tending to the needs of the economy, but no more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about the potential effect on the Mexican peso if the United States raised interest rates, Mancera said he did not think the peso would be &quot;very disturbed&quot; by a U.S. rate move which markets had already discounted.  </p>
<p>Recent gains in the peso's value were due solely to market forces which had reacted to the currency's &quot;previous excessive depreciation,&quot; Mancera added.</p>
