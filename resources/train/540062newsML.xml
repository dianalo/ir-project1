<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures were slightly easier in what brokers said was a small correction to late gains on Thursday but technical factors were bullish and news from Iraq also supported sentiment.</p>
<p>June Brent was just one cent down at $18.40 a barrel by 0957 GMT, while May gas oil gained $1.50 to trade at $166.25.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically it was a little overdone last night but the technicals are looking good. We are still going to go up,&quot; one IPE dealer said.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the important target for Brent was the $18.64-$18.77 gap on the June chart between.</p>
<p>Gas oil faced nearby resistance at $167.00.</p>
<p>Al Graham at Elliott Wave International in the U.S. was bullish about Friday's Brent action.</p>
<p>&quot;At Thursday's close the candle is fully lit on this bull rocket. Strap yourself in on Friday and enjoy the wave,&quot; he said in his daily London report.</p>
<p>Prices were jostled on Thursday by a reports from Iraq, unconfirmed by the U.N., that some of their staff had been arrested in the north of the country by A Kurdish faction.</p>
<p>&quot;When you hear the word 'Iraq' you want to get long first and ask questions later,&quot; MeesPierson said in a daily report.</p>
<p>&quot;It does feel as though Saddam is trying to push his luck in all directions, seeing just how far he can go before the U.N. takes retaliatory action. If past experience is anything to go by, he will continue until action is taken. Either way it is supportive for prices,&quot; the report said.</p>
