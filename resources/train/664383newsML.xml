<text>
<p>Bayer AG of Germany and GE Plastics, a unit of General Electric Co, said Monday they signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture to make abrasion-resistant coated polycarbonate automobile windows.</p>
<p>Both companies will have 50 percent of the joint venture, which is expected to start up in the second half of 1997. Approximately $40 million has been earmarked for investment by the joint venture during the next few years, they added.</p>
<p>The new company, which has yet to be named, will be primarily based in the Detroit area.  </p>
<p>The aim of the joint venture is to develop the materials, the abrasion-resistant coatings and process technologies required to enable the broad use of polycarbonate windows in advanced vehicle designs.</p>
<p>The companies made the announcement at the National Plastics Exposition being held here this week.</p>
<p>The technical and research and development efforts of both companies will be combined to develop a new polycarbonate window system having the abrasion resistance of glass.</p>
<p>The venture will build a development and engineering center, also to be located in Michigan, that will have the ability to manufacture more than one million polycarbonate windows for customer evaluation, the companies said. A development and marketing center, with its headquarters office in Germany, will also be established to serve Europe.</p>
<p>The joint-venture company will be represented by its own office in the Far East.</p>
