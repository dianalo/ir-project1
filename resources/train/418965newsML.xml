<p>Abuse of synthetic drugs such as Ecstasy and miracle diet pills is on the rise worldwide, and countries are failing to target those responsible, a U.N.-funded drugs body said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Vienna-based International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) said in its annual report that drug production, trafficking and abuse had spread to previously unaffected areas, aided by the opening up of global borders.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a drastic rise in Ecstasy misuse,&quot; Oskar Schroeder, INCB president told a news conference on the launch of the 1996 report. &quot;The illicit producers are mainly in Europe but the drug is now trafficked to other parts, particularly South East Asia,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately the situation is that in the mass media Ecstasy is glamorised as a wonderful medicament to get stronger, dance longer and stay awake for a long time, without knowing the health damage,&quot; Schroeder said.</p>
<p>While drug law enforcement had improved in some countries, with a significant rise in seizures, countries needed to focus their efforts internationally on catching drug kingpins, rather than small-time users and pushers, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Board suggests that countries set a higher priority on apprehending and punishing high-level criminals. For persons convicted of possessing small amounts of illicit drugs, alternatives to prison sentences should be considered.&quot;</p>
<p>The report highlighted the immense economic power of transnational crime syndicates, which it said posed a major threat to police, judiciary and politicians.</p>
<p>The INCB, run by a 13-member board, is the guarantor of international drug control treaties which outlaw narcotics such as cocaine, heroin and synthetic or &quot;designer&quot; drugs.</p>
<p>The board also voiced concern over a revival in the popularity of weight-reducing pills which offer a quick fix for obesity and contain amphetamine-type stimulants.</p>
<p>This trend was evident in a number of countries, particularly Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the U.S., where the illicit market in such tablets had expanded to health clubs, fashion shops and beauty farms, it said.</p>
<p>The adverse reactions to such pills ranged from heightened blood pressure to violent behaviour and paranoia, it warned.</p>
<p>Another cause for alarm was the growing abuse of Methylphenidate, a stimulant widely used to treat attention disorder (ADD) in children.</p>
<p>Consumption of this drug has jumped to 10 tonnes in 1995 from three tonnes in 1990. Methylphenidate-related emergency room cases for 10-to-14 year olds has multiplied tenfold since 1990 in the United States, the INCB said.</p>
<p>One positive finding of the report was that heroin and cocaine abuse were stagnating in Europe, although on the increase in Africa, Asia and the United States.</p>
<p>Schroeder attacked a Swiss government-controlled project to dispense heroin to addicts and the recent legalisation of cannabis in two U.S. states for medical purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;All those ideas are leading the wrong way. The only way is a drug-free society,&quot; he said.</p>
