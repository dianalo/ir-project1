<p>The hostage crisis began last Saturday when Ijaw tribesmen protesting the relocation of their local government headquarters to another town occupied six flow stations of Shell on which they detained 127 staff and contractors, all of them Nigerians.</p>
<p>Negotiations secured the release of the hostages starting with 18 on Monday and by Wednesday there were 88 still held.</p>
<p>The Shell spokesman in Lagos said the negotiations to secure the release of all the hostages had gone smoothly. &quot;Everything is calm. The rest of the staff and contractors should be freed later today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Three Ijaw tribesmen have died in the protests which escalated into riots in the oil town of Warri on Tuesday while several houses have also been torched.</p>
