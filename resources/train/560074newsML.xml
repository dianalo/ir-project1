<p>High capital gains and low tax provisions helped the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) post a higher than expected 1996/97 (April-March) net profit, analysts said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ICICI merged with another term-lender, SCICI, in a deal that took effect from April 1, 1996.</p>
<p>ICICI announced on Monday its post-merger net profit surged 62 percent to 7.7 billion rupees, outperforming analysts expectations of around 6.6-6.7 billion.</p>
<p>On the Bombay Stock Exchange, ICICI closed three percent higher at 59.50 rupees, up 1.75 from Friday's close. In kerb trading the stock made further headway, trading at 63 rupees.</p>
<p>Loans by India's second largest term lender totalled 111.81 billion rupees during the year.</p>
<p>In 1995/96 ICICI posted a net profit of 4.74 billion rupees.</p>
<p>&quot;The higher net profit seems to be on account of high capital gains,&quot; said Amit Rajpal, banking analyst at Prime Broking. &quot;We had anticipated lower capital gains, given the depressed nature of the capital market.&quot;</p>
<p>ICICI validated the analysts conclusion in a statement issued along with its results to the press but said an acitve portfolio management approach helped it book record gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The year 1996/97 was characterised by a predominant phase of bearish stock market sentiment,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Against such a backdrop, ICICI booked a record level of capital gains of 1.08 billion rupees.&quot;</p>
<p>Rajpal said he had estimated capital gains of around 700 million rupees.</p>
<p>Other factors which helped ICICI post a high net profit included tax provision which were around 100-150 million rupees lower than expected and an increase in dividend income on investments, Rajpal said.</p>
<p>The Bombay blue chip said profit after tax, but before adjustments, rose to 7.52 billion rupees from 4.36 billion.</p>
<p>It posted an earnings per share (EPS) of 16.30 rupees, and gave a dividend of 4.5 rupees per share of 10 rupees face value.</p>
