<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard rejected calls on Wednesday to pay compensation to a &quot;stolen generation&quot; of Aborigines taken from their parents during decades of forced assimilation by whites.</p>
<p>&quot;This is asking one generation to accept legal responsibility for the acts of earlier generations,&quot; Howard told parliament in an emotional debate which saw opposition leader Kim Beazley in tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Once a nation begins to go down that path, there is in fact no end,&quot; the conservative prime minister added.</p>
<p>The debate came as a landmark reconciliation conference ended in Melbourne with a warning that racial harmony could not be achieved without the nation's 200-year-old land conflict first being resolved.</p>
<p>Aboriginal leaders also called for a government apology and compensation to the tens of thousands of children uprooted under the assimilation policy, labelled genocidal this week in a report from Australia's Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>The forced assimilation practice, justified at the time as child welfare, stopped only in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The parliamentary Labor opposition has joined the call for compensation and Labor leader Beazley cried on Wednesday as he moved for parliament to set up processes for compensation and asked the government to apologise to the &quot;stolen generation&quot;.</p>
<p>Howard used his numbers in the parliament to vote down Beazley's motion but even as he did conservative parties in two states -- Western Australia and South Australia -- voted for official apologies to be made.</p>
<p>The Labor-led New South Wales legislature has already apologised.</p>
<p>Howard offered a personal apology on Monday but his opponents demanded a formal expression of national regret for one of the darkest chapters in Australia's history.</p>
<p>Beazley said the report detailed extraordinary experiences of children taken from their families to be exposed to sexual and physical assault, although he conceded that the current government was not to blame.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a terrible record, a terrible, terrible record,&quot; Beazley said, halting sometimes to contain his emotion. &quot;This is not a matter that we can sweep under this table.&quot;</p>
<p>The 700-page report on the &quot;stolen generation&quot; called for compensation and a government apology for what it called a policy amounting to genocide under international law.</p>
<p>The report contained a litany of physical and sexual abuse of Aborigines based predominantly on a policy of white racial superiority.</p>
<p>Many at the Melbourne reconciliation conference, which Howard addressed on Monday, have painted the prime minister as a villain and an obstacle to the goal of achieving some form of harmony by the centenary of Australian nationhood in 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we in Australia have the leadership to take us to reconciliation in 2001,&quot; said Noel Pearson, legal adviser to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</p>
<p>Since white settlement began in 1788, land has been at the heart of conflict between black and white Australia, much of it bloody. First settlers shot and poisoned Aborigines. Aborigines burnt homesteads and murdered some settlers in return.</p>
<p>Aborigines only won native land title in 1993 but Howard, who warns that up to 78 percent of Australia's vast land surface could be claimed, has proposed legislation watering it down.</p>
