<p>Russian space officials met on Monday to decide whether the three weary men on the damaged Mir space station or a relief crew will carry out dangerous repairs.</p>
<p>All indications before the meeting of the leading designers of Russia's space programme and officials from Korolyov Mission Control near Moscow were that the three-man crew involved in a collision in orbit on June 25 would not be asked to do the repairs.</p>
<p>Russian space officials have said that task is likely to be left to Russian cosmonauts Pavel Vinogradov and Anatoly Solovyov who are due to blast off for Mir on August 5.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said the meeting had concluded that the two cosmonauts would have to take special equipment with them for the repairs, leaving no room for Frenchman Leopold Eyharts who had been due to go with them.</p>
<p>Other details of the meeting were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Russian Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin and British-born NASA physicist Michael Foale have been limping through space in Mir since a cargo craft hit it during a practice docking on June 25.</p>
<p>The Spektr module attached to the sprawling space station was holed and Mir's power supply was damaged. The power supply can be fully restored only if two crew members don spacesuits and go into the airless Spektr.</p>
<p>Lazutkin, 39, and Tsibliyev, 43, had hoped to carry out the repairs but Tsibliyev developed an irregular heartbeat as stress began to tell on him and Mission Control decided to delay the work.</p>
<p>Other problems have plagued the mission. An unidentified liquid leaked into space after the collision and one of the crew caused a computer crash last Thursday by pulling out a cable.</p>
<p>There was some good news for Tsibliyev on Monday. A duty officer told Reuters that new medical tests showed his heart condition was improving.</p>
<p>&quot;The electrocardiogram showed that Vasily Tsibliyev's heart condition is improving,&quot; the duty officer said.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev and Lazutkin are scheduled to return to Earth on August 26. British-born NASA physicist Michael Foale, 40, is expected to return aboard a U.S. shuttle in mid-September.</p>
<p>Vinogradov and Solovyov are already training outside Moscow at Zvyozdny Gorodok (Star City) space centre to prepare for the repair work and are due to reach Mir on August 7.</p>
<p>The problems on Mir, which was originally expected to have a useful lifespan of about five years, have raised doubts about its future and that of Russian cooperation in space with the United States and other nations.</p>
