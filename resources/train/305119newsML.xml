<p>Successful bidders for ten-year concessions in Hungary's $200 million-a-year TV market will have three months to prepare the stations for going on air, the head of the regulatory body said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;(The bidders) are companies who operate a number of TV stations abroad and we are confident that three months will be enough for them (to start broadcasting),&quot; Mihaly T. Revesz, Chairman of the radio and TV regulatory body, ORTT, told a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope they can go on air at the beginning of September&quot;.</p>
<p>The minimum concession fee was set at eight billion forints per channel per year, plus 25 percent tax, the first three years to be paid in advance while subsequent yearly fees will be inflation-adjusted.</p>
<p>However, another official said bidders have yet to find out what additional fees they are supposed to pay but added that the two unclear elements, the broadcasting and frequency fees are not the ORTT's responsibility.</p>
<p>&quot;What we could do was to offer our expertise in the field to those responsible for the decisions,&quot; said ORTT spokesman Gyorgy Lovas.</p>
<p>Questions surrounding transmissions, to be assured by national broadcasting company Antenna Hungaria Rt, also have to be clarified, Revesz said.</p>
<p>State-owned Antenna Hungaria, which transmits all Hungary's TV and radio programmes, needs a cash injection to prepare its infrastructure for nationwide broadcasting on a presently vacant channel once used by the occupying Soviet forces.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is supposed to vote on the capital increase within days,&quot; Revesz said.</p>
<p>He added that ORTT estimates show that private investors will see a return on investment from the seventh year of the concession.</p>
<p>Successful bidders will have to broadcast a minimum 18 hours per day of which advertising will be limited to 15 percent or 12 minutes per hour.</p>
<p>They will also have to commission at least 10 percent of their programmes from independent domestic producers and are expected to air their own 20-minute news programme in the evening peak hours.</p>
<p>Bidders will have to submit their detailed plans and concession fee offers by April 10, the tender said.</p>
<p>The offered concession fee carries a 50 percent weighting in the judgement of the tenders.</p>
<p>Only consortia are expected to bid and no single company is allowed to have more than a 49 percent stake, while Hungarians have to hold a minimum of 26 percent.</p>
<p>Foreign companies said to be lining up to bid for the TV channels include US-based Central European Media Enterprises, CLT-Bertelsmann, which owns RTL satellite television, a Hungarian-Swedish consortium MTM-SBS and a consortium of French channel TF1 and the German Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.</p>
<p>On Monday Hungarian telecommunications company Matav Rt, in which a consortium of Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech Corp has a 67 percent stake, told Reuters it was considering bidding for one of the channels.</p>
