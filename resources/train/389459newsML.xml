<p>Malaysia's proposed over-the-counter (OTC) stock market for high-growth firms with no profit history is a promising concept, but one that will take time to develop, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Blueprints for the Malaysian Exchange of Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation (MESDAQ) were unveiled on Tuesday, and the market is expected to be operating before the end of the year. MESDAQ is modelled on the highly-successful electronic NASDAQ market in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very forward-looking move,&quot; said electronics analyst Bernard Tan at Merrill Lynch in Singapore. &quot;There could be a lot of companies they're hoping to attract that may not be quite ripe yet.&quot;</p>
<p>A local fund manager said &quot;barely a handful of companies&quot; may initially list on MESDAQ.</p>
<p>Regulators say the main target would be high-technology firms, especially those associated with a planned Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Biotechnology, aerospace technology and telecommunications industries were also welcome.</p>
<p>The MSC, conceived by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, is a proposed 15 by 40 km (nine by 25 mile) corridor stretching south from Kuala Lumpur to a new airport and administrative capital.</p>
<p>Unlike stock listings on Malaysia's main board and small-capitalised Second Board, which require at least a five-year profit track record, no such pedigree would be demanded from MESDAQ's candidates.</p>
<p>But companies seeking to list on the OTC market must have minimum paid-up capital of two million ringgit ($803,000) with no ceiling. In addition, at least 70 percent of the funds raised via MESDAQ must be invested in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Even 100 percent foreign-owned companies are eligible for MESDAQ listing.</p>
<p>Regulators say that while companies would operate in a &quot;full disclosure-based&quot; environment, the stocks would be regarded as high-risk and investors should be properly informed.</p>
<p>&quot;It's obviously not going to be for everybody,&quot; said Matthew Geiger, a financial analyst at PhileoAllied Securities. &quot;But there are a number of investors quite keen on the potential of all these companies. This is not an unregulated market.&quot;</p>
<p>The head of an investors' group was enthusiastic about the new market, saying that small-capitalised bourses have at times significantly outperformed their larger brethren.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally, we welcome this concept. We think there's a big scope for high-tech companies not only in this part of the world but that it's a global trend,&quot; said Patrick Lim, president of the Malaysia Investors' Association.</p>
<p>He said software developers, computer-related product makers and technology information service providers may be among MESDAQ's listings.</p>
<p>But the local fund manager was more skeptical.</p>
<p>The requirement that 70 percent of funds raised be invested in Malaysia could deter some foreign companies, he said. As for local firms, &quot;there aren't that many which would probably qualify for listing even on an OTC market,&quot; he said.</p>
