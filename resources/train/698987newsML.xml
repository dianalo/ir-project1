<title>USA: UroHealth restates results, stock drops.</title>
<headline>UroHealth restates results, stock drops.</headline>
<dateline>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.</dateline>
<text>
<p>UroHealth Systems Inc., a maker of surgical products, Tuesday revised downward the results of the first three quarters of fiscal 1997, prompting a sharp sell-off of the company's stock.</p>
<p>UroHealth fell almost $1, or more than 16 percent, to $5 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>The Newport Beach, Calif.-based company restated its results to show the effects of a deferral of some revenue.</p>
<p>Earnings per share for the third quarter ended Dec. 31, 1996, were restated to 1 cent from an original 15 cents. Its net loss per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 1996, was restated to $1.88 from $1.80 and its loss for the quarter ended June 30, 1996, was restated to 22 cents from 16 cents previously.</p>
<p>UroHealth said the deferred revenue is associated with initial stock orders to distributors for products shipped by its surgical division and new video endoscopy products shipped during fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>As a result, the company will defer recognising revenues of $900,000, $1.3 million, $2.7 million and $11.7 million related to net shipments in the first through fourth quarters of fiscal 1997, respectively, it said.</p>
