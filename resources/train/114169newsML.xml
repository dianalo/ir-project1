<p>The President of the Senate, Margaret Reid, is threatening an embarrassing snub to the United States President Bill Clinton by opposing plans for him to address a historic joint sitting of Parliament - an event scheduled to be the highlight of his Australian visit in November - saying it is not &quot;our custom&quot; for visiting leaders to address a joint sitting.

<p>Under proposed new laws expected to attract bipartisan support in the Parliament, New South Wales police would gain the power to detain and interrogate suspects for up to 12 hours without laying charges - a suggestion that has enraged the legal fraternity.

<p>THE AGE</p>
<p>The Victorian Racing Club last night announced a review of drug testing after the Lee Freedman-trained three-year-old colt Encosta de Lago was allowed to race to victory in the A$175,000 Bill Stutt Stakes on 29 September, even though it had returned an illegal blood reading. The horse produced a reading of 37.4 - above the legal limit of 37.0 - when tested for a performance enhancing substance known as TCO2, but was still allowed to race after a highly unusual third test was conducted.

<p>The Coroner's Court heard yesterday that although night staff working at Kew Cottages told fire officers there was no fire, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade arrived at the scene five minutes later to discover an &quot;extensive&quot; fire in progress, which led to the death of nine intellectually disabled men and partially destroyed units 30 and 31 of the state institution for the intellectually disabled.

<p>The future of the Senate committee investigating the tendering process for the Melbourne casino is in doubt, after legal advice indicated the Commonwealth did not have the power to force state officials to give evidence.
