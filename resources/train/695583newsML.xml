<headline>UK stocks falter on pre-Budget nerves.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>UK shares ended near the day's lows on Monday as sentiment was knocked by growing fears of interest rate rises and nervousness ahead of the Labour government's first Budget on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the start of what could be a very volatile week,&quot; commented one trader. &quot;Nobody is interested in taking things on before the Budget...everyone is just getting out of the way,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index closed 35.7 points lower at 4,604.6, after being up 20 points in early trade. Losers outweighed gainers by three-to-one. The Mid-250 index finished 14.7 points off at 4,431.3.  </p>
<p>British shares had lost an early gain by late morning after strong domestic economic data highlighted the strength in the consumer sector, sending UK gilts tumbling.</p>
<p>Analysts said stronger-than-expected money supply figures and a leap in consumer credit in May had reinforced the need for higher personal taxes in the budget to dampen consumer spending.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures confirmed the strength in the consumer sector and the need for something to slow it down,&quot; said Stuart Weatherby, economist at Panmure Gordon. &quot;This is more likely to be higher base rates given the lack of any commitment to raising direct personal taxation,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Economists forecast that if the Chancellor does not aim tax increases at the private sector, the Bank of England will increase interest rates aggressively to make sure the government's inflation targets can be met.</p>
<p>Tension ahead of the Budget, coupled with the latest unwelcome economic data, was aggravated when U.S. stocks reversed their opening gains.</p>
<p>The Dow had opened strongly, but stumbled when U.S. data came in higher-than-expected on the eve of the U.S. FOMC policy meeting. Few economists expected the Fed to raise rates this time around but investors preferred to remain cautious.  </p>
<p>The Dow was 37 points lower as London markets closed.</p>
<p>&quot;The money supply and consumer credit figures reversed the engines early on and Wall Street called the tune this afternoon,&quot; said one senior trader. &quot;There are a lot of reasons to be wary.&quot;</p>
<p>Activity remained relatively slim: volume totalled 670 million by 1530 GMT. Traders said most of the share price movements had been exaggerated by market-makers trying to keep their positions flat.</p>
<p>Among individual stock movers, Severn Trent jumped 15-1/2p to 780p on plans to return 134 million stg to shareholders.  </p>
<p>The water company said shareholders would receive one ordinary share of 62p nominal value and one B share of 38p nominal value in exchange for every existing share of 100p.</p>
<p>National Westminster Bank was in positive territory for most of the day but closed 3-1/2p lower at 807p.</p>
<p>Bid speculation had continued to help the stock after a report in the Financial Times said NatWest had pressed Barclays for a firm denial that it planned to make a bid. Barclays lost 32p to 11.93 stg.</p>
<p>Retailer Next led the sector lower on worries over budget measures to cool consumer spending.  </p>
<p>Next fell 25-1/2p to 678-1/2p and Kingfisher lost 14-1/2p to 681-1/2p.</p>
<p>Shares in BSkyB fell 13p to 440-1/2 as a press report said there were regulatory concerns about its system of &quot;bundling&quot; channels and BTR bucked the trend to rise 7-1/2p to 206-1/2 after a press report sparked break-up talk.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bridon leapt 30p to 136 after revealing a takeover approach from FKI.</p>
