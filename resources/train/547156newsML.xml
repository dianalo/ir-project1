<title>USA: CBOT wheat ends mostly firm on technical bounce.</title>
<headline>CBOT wheat ends mostly firm on technical bounce.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT wheat futures closed mostly higher on a technical bounce tied to signals the market was oversold after the recent price break, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were on a big break and satisfied the downside technical objectives,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Nearby May ended lower on long liquidation before Wednesday, first notice day for deliveries on the May contract. Traders were expecting up to two million bushels of wheat to be posted Wednesday on the May contract.</p>
<p>Gains were limited on improved crop weather this week in the U.S. and France and on improved crop ratings.</p>
<p>Recent showers in France helped slow deterioration of crops in several important wheat areas. In the U.S., weather patterns suggest a more conducive crop-growing scenario.</p>
<p>Storms forecast this week could bring showers to dry areas of northern Kansas, said Joel Burgio of Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>The head of the national grain office ONIC said Tuesday crops in the key growing areas of northern France may recover from a three-month drought, but the situation in the south looks worse.</p>
<p>Wheat closed two cents higher to two lower, with May down one at $4.11 and July was up 1-3/4 at $4.23.</p>
