<p>J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said Monday it will offer voluntary early retirement to approximately 1,500 people, or about 5 percent of its management staff.</p>
<p>The retailer said that if the package is accepted by all of the eligible employees, it will reduce costs by $120 million a year and may reduce the potential for additional staff reductions in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it expects to post a one-time, pre-tax charge of up to $200 million later this year for the early retirement programme. The size of the charge will depend on the number of employees who elect to take the voluntary buyout.</p>
<p>Employees of JCPenney stores, catalogue, and corporate support management who are or will be 55 years of age or older and have at least 10 years of service with the company as of April 10, 1998, are eligible for the programme. Employees of the company's Eckerd Drugstores and insurance subsidiaries are not eligible.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognise that in order to continue to build on our leadership position in an increasingly competitive retailing environment, it is essential for us to continue to develop a competitive cost structure,&quot; said Chairman James Oesterreicher.</p>
<p>&quot;We are firmly committed to accelerating our ongoing expense reduction programme and significantly lowering our expense-to-sales ratio. We will increase our operating efficiencies, work on process changes and implement additional cost-saving initiatives,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>One of the nation's leading department store chains, J.C. Penney has struggled lately under the weight of weak sales and excess inventories.</p>
<p>At the same time, it has focused on expanding its pharmacy business, culminating with its acquisition earlier this year of Eckerd Corp., the No. 4 drug store chain in the United States.</p>
<p>Penney is expected to post flat earnings per share when it reports its second-quarter results on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The buyout news was released after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where the company's stock rose 50 cents to close at $58.125.</p>
