<p>NWE naphtha prices ended slightly higher on Thursday but the market was still dogged by high freight rates in the north and the Med.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem again is about the freight rates,&quot; said one source.</p>
<p>The cost of shipping a cargo from Skikda to Northwest Europe is roughly high quotes +$10, but the market is only fetching high +$2, he said.</p>
<p>Material, therefore, will likely move into an end-user's system or a trader will sit on it and hope for a change in the market.</p>
<p>End-user demand appeared to be picking up in the Med but the high freight rates has had the effect of making that market even tighter, the source said.</p>
<p>Feb swaps ended $3 higher at $221/$222 a tonne and March rose the same amount to $215.50/$216.50, pulling back from their highs when crude edged lower.</p>
<p>Earlier, Stichting Euroilstock said in its monthly report that naphtha production in the European Union, excluding Sweden, rose 26,000 barrels per day in December, or 2.7 percent, to 994,000 bpd.</p>
<p>That is 110,000 bpd or 12.6 pct higher than in December 1995.</p>
