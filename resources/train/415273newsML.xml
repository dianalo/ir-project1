<p>**  Profit-booking by local players trims early spurt,</p>

<p>Post-budget euphoria gripping Indian bourses ran into profit-taking on Monday, and prices ended near the day's lows after some wild swings, dealers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) ended with a net gain of 13.56 points, or 0.35 percent at 3,871.05, erasing a sharp 150.42 points, or 3.9 percent rally which rocketed the index above the 4,000 mark.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess there is a certain amount of profit-taking which is quite healthy. It doesn't look like there is a trend reversal,&quot; said Prashant Purker, head of institutional sales at Peregrine Capital India Ltd.  </p>
<p>Analysts said benchmark stocks lagged in the market rally as buying interest switched to smaller capitalised stocks, with investors finding cheap values at current prices.</p>
<p>&quot;This reaction is quite healthy. It only gives opportunity for more people to enter the market,&quot; said the head of dealing at a foreign securities firm who did not wish to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the market to form a bottom in the next few days and break the all-time high of 4,643 reached in September 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>The breadth and focus of Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's 1997/98 (April-March) budget last Friday, boosted market confidence and sent investors on a buying spree, traders said.  </p>
<p>BHEL closed 13.25 rupees up at 285.0, Colgate 15.0 to 355.0 and Arvind Mills 7.75 to 156.25. Among pivotals, Reliance fell 4.50 rupees to 305.50 and SBI 7.75 to 324.0.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign funds will go in for large market-capitalised stocks. Having missed the rally, they must be frustrated.&quot; Ajit Dayal, director at Quantum Financial Services, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who doubted that reforms were on the stumbling block are now silent. The coalition has given us a fantastic budget,&quot; Quantum's Dayal said. He forecast the index would hit 4,500 points within three months.</p>
