<p>The Beirut Stock Exchange struggled to capture investor interest on Thursday and brokers said a government order to crack down on dissent may have had an impact.</p>
<p>The LIBX bank index fell 1.89 percent to 191.31 and the LISPI fell 0.52 percent to 97.20 while the BLOM fell 0.09 percent to 1111.10.</p>
<p>BSE turnover climbed to 192,037 from 173,813 for a value of $2,488,136 against $2,089,456.</p>
<p>Brokers said the Lebanese cabinet's decision late on Wednesday to order the army and security forces to crack down on the leaders of a civil disobedience campaign may have had an indirect impact on the market.</p>
<p>They also speculated that the latest tensions in southern Lebanon where pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas are fighting to drive Israeli forces from the Jewish state's occupation zone may have had an effect.</p>
<p>Former Hizbollah leader Sheikh Sobhi Tufaili has launched a &quot;hunger revolt&quot; in the form of a civil disobedience campaign to highlight what he says is government neglect of the poor.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is not very bullish. Investors do not seem to be as encouraged as before,&quot; said one broker who requested anonymity.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this may be due to the latest political developments. It may have had an indirect impact.&quot;</p>
<p>Solidere A and B shares held steady at $13.</p>
<p>Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce dropped to $20.25 from $21.25 and Banque Audi fell to $27.25 from $27.50. Bank of Beirut was flat at $5.75.</p>
<p>Ciments Libanais was steady at $1.2813.</p>
