<p>U.S. Midcontinent unleaded gasoline differentials were steady late Friday but seen easing next week on perceptions of plentiful stocks in the region, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there should be some additional softening on gasoline in the Group,&quot; a Kansas City trader said. &quot;There's plenty of gas around.&quot;</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded differentials also were unchanged late in the week, while unconfirmed rumors of outages at Fina's Port Arthur, Texas refinery and BP and Farmland refineries in the Midwest continued to float through the market.  </p>
<p>The outlook was less clear on low sulphur diesel differentials, with some traders betting that agricultural demand peaked last week while others said there were several weeks remaining in the autumn harvest and tightness in diesel barrels could push differentials higher by late October.</p>
<p>The Williams pipeline system, a key barometer of inventories in the Group, reported a 21-day supply of gasoline with a large shipment expected at month-end and a 23-day supply of low sulphur diesel on hand.</p>
<p>Unleaded gasoline for all October timings was unchanged at 1.50/1.25 cents under NYMEX November unleaded in Group Three and 1.25/1.0 cents under the print in Chicago.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel was bid 1.50 cent over NYMEX November heating oil for prompt and later deliveries in Group Three and 3.0 cents under the print in Chicago.</p>
<p>High sulphur diesel differentials were steady at 1.25/0.75 cents a gallon under NYMEX November heating oil in Group Three and 6.0 cents under the print in Chicago.</p>
