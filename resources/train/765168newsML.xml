<p>Brisk new-home sales in June pulled the supply of houses on the market to a four-year low, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday, as an expanding economy braced consumer demand.</p>
<p>Sales increased 6.1 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 819,000 units after a steeply revised 1 percent rise to 772,000 in May.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said May sales had jumped 7.1 percent to a much higher rate of 825,000. Commerce also revised down sales for March and April from levels that it had estimated earlier.</p>
<p>Analysts said widespread revisions, especially the big downward change in May sales, complicated interpetation of the monthly figures. But, they said the positive trend on a year-over-year basis combined with slim inventories increased chances that sales could set a new record this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are on target to shatter the record for home sales of 757,000 units set last year,&quot; said Joel Naroff, an economist for First Union Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>Naroff said rising incomes, high levels of consumer confidence and a soaring stock market have bolstered homeowners' buying power.</p>
<p>Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said sales for the full year should hit 800,000. The monthly selling pace likely will ease in the second half, he added, but at a lofty enough level to ensure a record for full-year sales.</p>
<p>June sales were running 11.9 percent above the level a year earlier, when new homes were selling at a rate of 732,000 a year.</p>
<p>The supply of homes on the market was down to 282,000 by the end of June from 283,000 in May -- the lowest inventory level since July 1993, when only 278,000 homes were available.</p>
<p>&quot;Very low inventory levels suggest that housing sales should continue at least at this robust level through the end of the summer and that construction activity will be strong through the fall as they balance inventories,&quot; said economist Eileen Neely of Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored agency that packages home mortgages for resale to investors.</p>
<p>At June's sales pace there was only a 4.2-month supply of new homes on the market, the lowest in 26 years, since a 4.1-month supply in July 1971.</p>
<p>Naroff of First Union noted that the housing industry's momentum should reinforce the economy, already in its seventh year of growth since the last recession ended in March 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;As households furnish their newly purchased homes, the impacts on durable goods industries and housing-related industries will be great, with the spending continuing through next spring at least,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Monthly sales increased in every region during June except the Northeast, where they dropped 21.1 percent to 71,000 after a 3.4 percent increase in May.</p>
<p>Midwest sales climbed 7 percent to 153,000 after a 9.2 percent increase in May, and in the South sales were up 9.2 percent following a 1.2 percent gain in May.</p>
<p>Sales in the West increased strongly by 12.4 percent to 226,000 in June after a 5.2 percent decline in May.</p>
<p>The average home sales price climbed to $176,400 in June from $168,500 in May.</p>
