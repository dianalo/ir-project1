<p>Stock markets dropped on both sides of the Atlantic on Wednesday as investors cashed in profits and took to the sidelines, while the mark advanced against the dollar and a weak yen.</p>
<p>Wall Street, which had slipped from record levels earlier this week, fell more than 40 points on the Dow Jones industrial average within 15 minutes of its opening.</p>
<p>In Europe, leading bourses which had lost ground on Tuesday and in morning trading on Wednesday were discouraged further after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing said there was no reason to expect more cuts in key German interest rates.</p>
<p>Issing's comments provided further fuel for the mark, which hit its highest level in more than 3-1/2 years against the yen. It rose through its previous 1996 high of 73.78 yen to reach a peak of 74.17.</p>
<p>Traders said a growing belief in the foreign exchange market that Japanese interest rates would stay low for a while was depressing the yen.</p>
<p>The dollar, while losing more than a pfennig against the German currency, revived from early weakness to set its highest level against the yen since January 1994 at 113.0 yen.</p>
<p>Just a few hours earlier, U.S. comments about the harm which a high dollar rate could have on trade had sent it down as far as 112.04 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Although there are signs the U.S. administration may be getting a little nervous about the effects of a higher dollar on the trade deficit, it's now clear interest rates are going to remain low in Tokyo and funds will continue to flow out of Japan,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this view, Bank of Japan governor Yasuo Matsushita said that while the economy was growing gradually, it was unlikely to accelerate soon and market expectations of higher rates were receding.</p>
<p>In the slightly longer term, currency analysts said that while the market was turning a blind eye to the looming U.S. election, the dollar could lose its composure even if President Bill Clinton scores his expected victory on November 5.</p>
<p>If the Democrats seized control of the U.S. Congress from the Republicans, this could prompt market fears of looser U.S. fiscal and trade policy, unsettling the dollar, they said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the London stock market fell in dull trading, with little fresh domestic company and economic news to come to its aid. Investors took profits after a record-breaking run.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not seeing too much pressure and people are tending to stand back. The market is a little undecided about where the next big move is going to be,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>All eyes were on New York, where the Dow was still down more than 30 points lower after an hour of trading.</p>
<p>Whatever Wall Street's immediate prospects, investors pondering whether the world's biggest stock market can add to its heady gains were given encouragement by Steven Einhorn, partner and head of global investment research at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Speaking in Hong Kong, he said the bull market that has swept U.S. share prices to record levels should continue into 1998 and European equities could do even better.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 German blue chips was dragged down by a plunge of almost a quarter in the shares of business software firm SAP after a profits warning.</p>
<p>French shares also tracked bonds lower. Shares in resorts group Club Mediterranee, which also issued a profits warning late on Tuesday, fell by almost a fifth.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar traded around 1.5200 marks and 112.70 yen, compared with Tuesday's late 1.5347 and 112.83.</p>
<p>STOCKS AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was down 27.8 points at 4,029.4.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade 19.45 lower at 2,699.53 and dropped to 2,680 in later electronic business. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index lost 27.55 at 2,148.06.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, the Dow was down 33.17 at 6,028.64</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $383.50 an ounce in the afternoon, down from a $383.95 setting in the morning and compared with $383.65 at the London close on Tuesday. Silver was steady at $4.97.</p>
