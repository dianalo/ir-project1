<p>U.S. manufacturing accelerated strongly last month, suggesting healthy economic expansion heading into 1997, analysts said after reviewing a key factory-sector survey.</p>
<p>The National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) on Thursday said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 54.0 in December from 52.7 in November.</p>
<p>Economists had expected the index would decline to 51.5, according to a Reuters poll last Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;If (the NAPM index) were to continue at this level ... you would have (Gross Domestic Product) growth in the 3.0 to 3.5 percent range,&quot; said Matthew Alexy, chief bond market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>Norbert Ore, the new chairman of the NAPM's Business Survey Committee, concurred.</p>
<p>&quot;By the data that we track, 54.0 would be equal to a 3.5-percent (growth rate), which would be a pretty strong economy,&quot; Ore said in a teleconference following release of the report.  </p>
<p>The jump in the NAPM index triggered bond-market selling in which the price of the bellwether 30-year bond slid more than a full point. Stocks plummeted as well.</p>
<p>Individual components of the report appeared more troubling than the headline number, analysts said.</p>
<p>The prices paid index, in particular, climbed to 51.5 from 45.9, prompting some concern about inflation and questions about Federal Reserve monetary policy.</p>
<p>Michelle Colley Laughlin, chief Treasuries strategist at Prudential Securities Inc, said the price index reading would prompt fears the Fed would hike interest rates near term.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's raising concerns over a possible Fed tightening in the first quarter,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Any concern might be premature, however, Laughlin added.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's a temporary increase tied to the recent energy price gains,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Supplier deliveries inched upward last month, to 51.6 from 51.5, suggesting there is no major bottleneck that might trigger a longer-term price run-up, Laughlin said.</p>
<p>Kurt Karl, chief economist of WEFA Group's U.S. forecasting center, said although the NAPM index might not signal an imminent rate hike, it erases hopes for an easing.</p>
<p>&quot;We had thought the Fed would perhaps lower interest rates this year, and we just decided this morning that's quite unlikely,&quot; Karl said. &quot;We'll have no change in Fed interest rates this year.&quot;</p>
<p>On the flip side, Karl said, NAPM at 54.0 is not outrageously strong.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifty-four is not a terribly strong purchasing managers' number,&quot; he said. &quot;It is growing and it is slightly above average.&quot;</p>
