<p>The Australian government-owned Telstra Corp said on Friday that its net profit before abnormal items in the first six months of 1996/97 (July-June) was in line with its own forecasts.</p>
<p>The company, set for a one-third float sometime within the next two years, said the abnormal loss of A$1.026 billion in the latest period ended December 31 was due to planned staff redundancies and restructuring costs over the three years to June 1999.  </p>
<p>&quot;The figures show that in an increasingly competitive environment, Telstra's business and financial strategies are working,&quot; chief executive officer Frank Blount said in a statement.</p>
<p>Telstra's net profit before abnormal items rose by 16.1 percent to A$1.40 billion, while net profit after abnormals fell to A$742 million from A$1.205 billion.</p>
<p>Sales rose by 4.8 percent to A$8.00 billion.</p>
<p>Blount said a highlight of the first half was cost control, with operating costs rising by 3.8 percent against 10.6 percent a year ago. Total expenses rose by 1.7 percent.  </p>
<p>Blount also said revenue growth slowed in the latest period due to increased competition and the softening economy in the final half of calendar 1996.</p>
<p>Telstra said its revenue stream from traditional telephony activities had faced more competition but was offsetting this by an involvement in new and enhanced products, citing mobile, wholesale, ISDN, faxstream, and data networks.</p>
<p>Blount said Telstra would face further competition with the deregulation of the industry from July 1997 and would respond by further reducing its cost base. Telstra was also prepared for its upcoming partial privatisation, which it supported.  </p>
<p>Telstra said the abnormal loss was the result of its three year strategic plan outlined in the 1995/96 annual report. The plan involved substantial productivity improvements giving rise to a significant reduction in employees.</p>
<p>It said total staff numbers fell by more than 7,000 in the latest period to 69,483 from 76,522.</p>
