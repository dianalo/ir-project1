<p>The majority of Italians do not believe Italy will be a founder member of the planned European single currency and are not prepared to make any more sacrifices to ensure it does, an opinion poll published on Monday said.</p>
<p>The Explorer poll carried out for La Stampa newspaper said 51.2 percent of people had little or no hope that Italy would join European economic and monetary union (EMU), despite years of tough budgetary rigour from successive governments.</p>
<p>And in a country which has traditionally been a fervent supporter of EMU, a massive 70.7 percent of those asked said they did not want to pay any more to guarantee Italy's euro bid -- up 17 percentage points on December.</p>
<p>Italians are currently forced to pay a so-called Euro-tax to help tame the state deficit and win the country a place in the single currency when it takes off in 1999.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left government has promised more budget cuts for next year to improve Treasury accounts and is about to start negotiations with unions and business leaders over a reform of welfare spending.</p>
<p>But 59.9 percent of people said they wanted Prodi to defend the welfare state and introduce schemes aimed at boosting employment, even if this risked delaying Italy's entry into EMU.</p>
<p>Just 27.4 percent thought the government was right to continue with its belt-tightening policies.</p>
<p>Explorer carried out 1,000 interviews by telephone for the poll between June 3-5.</p>
