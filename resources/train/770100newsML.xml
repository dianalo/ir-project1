<headline>Nigeria again tops survey list of corrupt nations.</headline>

<p>Nigeria, Bolivia and Colombia are considered by business people and political analysts the most corrupt among 52 countries listed in a survey published in Berlin on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the authors, Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International (TI) said it was a myth that western industrialised democracies were immune to widespread bribery, kickbacks and influence peddling.</p>
<p>&quot;One need only look at the difference in how Belgium is perceived this year, the country with the steepest rise in its corruption perception,&quot; TI Chairman and ex-World Bank Director Peter Eigen told reporters.</p>
<p>He cited outrage there against the judicial system and political class which exploded last autumn among Belgians after a series of child abuse scandals.</p>
<p>&quot;One sees Singapore at the other end of the scale,&quot; Eigen said, which was ranked as the ninth least corrupt of the nations surveyed. &quot;The connection between democracy and corruption is very fragile. It is not a linear correlation.&quot;</p>
<p>The survey, in its third year, draws its conclusions from up to seven different business surveys in each country to evaluate how business people, political analysts and the general public perceived the degree of corruption in a country.</p>
<p>TI said only 52 countries provided sufficient data, meaning Nigeria was unlikely to be the most corrupt country in the world.</p>
<p>On a scale of zero, for utterly corrupt, to 10, for completely corruption-free, Nigeria was rated 1.76 -- keeping it in the worst slot on the list for a second year running -- followed by Bolivia with 2.05 and Colombia at 2.23.</p>
<p>Denmark came first with a 9.94 honesty rating, Finland second with 9.48 and Sweden third with 9.35. New Zealand dropped to fourth place from first this year with a 9.23 rating.</p>
<p>Russia had the worst reputation for corruption among major economies, coming in as fourth most corrupt of the 52 surveyed nations. India was ranked eighth and China 12th most corrupt.</p>
<p>TI said some wealthy nations, including Germany, fostered corruption by allowing companies to register bribe payments to foreign firms as &quot;useful expenses&quot; which could be written off against taxes.</p>
<p>Among the Group of Seven leading global industrial powers, Canada was ranked highest in the honesty stakes at 5th, Germany 13th, Britain 14th, the United States 16th, France 20th, Japan 21st and Italy 30th.</p>
