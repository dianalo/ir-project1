<headline>Video link-up planned for Mir's Foale.</headline>
<dateline>KOROLYOV, Russia 1997-07-21</dateline>

<p>U.S. astronaut Michael Foale will be able to chat with his family on Monday in a video link-up with the crippled Mir space station, officials at Mission Control said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Foale will speak to his familiy this evening,&quot; said Mark Severance, a NASA representative at Korolyov Mission Control outside Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to brush my teeth before that,&quot; reporters heard Foale, a British-born NASA physicist, telling operators during a radio link-up with Mission Control on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Foale's colleagues, Russians Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin, had a video link-up with Earth at the weekend.</p>
<p>Mir has been limping through space since a collision on June 25. The crew have been doing minor repairs but have not carried out the dangerous repairs needed to fully restore the power supply damaged in the accident.</p>
<p>Russian space officials have praised the crew's efforts but indicated the repair is likely to be done by a relief crew due to reach Mir on August 7.</p>
<p>Space officials and Mir designers were meeting on Monday to to make a final decision on the repairs.</p>
<p>Problems have plagued the mission since the accident, in which a module attached to Mir was holed during a manual docking manoeuvre.</p>
<p>After the accident an unidentified liquid leaked into space, Tsibliyev suffered a heart problem brought on by stress and Mir lost orientation for one day last week when one of the crew pulled out the wrong cable and a computer crashed.</p>
