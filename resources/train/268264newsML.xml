<p>Pope John Paul and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat discussed the Middle East peace process and tensions in Jerusalem on Thursday during their fifth meeting, the Vatican said.</p>
<p>Arafat, on a one-day visit to Rome, met the Pope briefly in his private study in the Vatican. The Palestinian leader later held talks with Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, the Vatican's foreign minister.</p>
<p>&quot;In both meetings, there was an exchange of news and views about the way the Middle East peace process is going and the situation of the people in the autonomous territories,&quot; a Vatican statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Particular attention was paid to the climate of tension and suffering in the Arab part of Jerusalem.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinians object to an Israeli proposal to build housing for Jews in the Ras al-Amud neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, which Palestinians view as the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>The plan to build 132 private housing units in the heart of the Arab neighbourhood is awaiting ministerial approval.</p>
<p>Arafat, wearing traditional Arab head-dress and a green uniform, greeted the 76-year-old Pope warmly when he entered his study, kissing his white cassock twice in an embrace.</p>
<p>The two men also discussed the question of preparing Bethlehem, the town of Christ's birth, for celebrations to mark the start of the third millennium of Christianity in 2000.</p>
<p>Arafat has said that he would like to see the Pope and Jewish and Moslem religious leaders praying together in Jerusalem and Bethlehem in the anniversary year.</p>
<p>The Pope has said he would like to visit Holy Land sites before the start of the new millennium or in 2000. He has a standing invitation to visit Israel but church sources say they do not expect a visit before 1998.</p>
<p>Diplomats say such a visit could be fraught with political difficulties precisely because of territorial disputes, including the status of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When he visited Rome in September, Arafat said the entire Middle East peace process would hinge on the question of the Holy City. He said Palestinians wanted Jerusalem to be an open city and the capital of two people.</p>
<p>Israel declared Jerusalem its &quot;united and eternal&quot; capital in 1980, 13 years after its forces captured the city's Arab eastern sector from Jordan in the Six-Day War. Jerusalem's fate is up for negotiation at final peace talks.</p>
<p>The Vatican wants international guarantees protecting Jerusalem as a city sacred to Christians, Moslems and Jews.</p>
<p>Arafat was to meet Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini later on Thursday and attend the inauguration of an exhibition called Bethlehem 2000.</p>
