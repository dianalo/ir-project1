<p>Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi confirmed on Tuesday that his opposition Freedom Alliance would be willing to support proposals to bring forward Italy's 1998 budget.</p>
<p>Berlusconi repeated his offer in an article written for Rome's Il Messaggero newspaper.</p>
<p>He said that his opposition and the coalition of Prime Minister Romano Prodi agreed on two basic points: trying to bring forward the 1998 budget and trying to reach agreement on reform of Italy's highly generous pension system.</p>
<p>He suggested that discussion of the budget could start as early as this spring.</p>
<p>Berlusconi has said several times recently that he was open to government proposals to bring forward the 1998 budget as long as it contained structural measures to cut social welfare spending.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has said next year's budget could be approved as early as August 15 if all political forces agreed.</p>
<p>Ciampi said that such a move would be a clear signal that Italy wanted to be in the first wave of European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>The budget normally has to be drawn up by September 30 and passed into law by parliament by end-December. -- Rome newsroom +396-6782501</p>
