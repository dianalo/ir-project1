<p>German shares proved resilient to U.S. shocks on Wednesday, posting solid gains in the bourse session and recovering fast from a brief dip on stronger-than-expected U.S. data in the post-bourse session.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index ended the day up 12.23 points at 3,438.09 points, having briefly dropped to a low of 3,416.11 points after a far stronger than expected first quarter U.S. GDP report retriggered concern about imminent rate rises.</p>
<p>&quot;The market seems to be holding up well against shocks from the U.S. at the moment,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;I think the 3,400 (DAX points) level is pretty well secured.&quot;</p>
<p>The DAX index, catching up with gains made in post-bourse dealings on Tuesday, had ended the bourse session at mid-afternoon at 3,438.07, up 54.88 points.</p>
<p>Volumes were generally low ahead of the May 1 public holiday which will keep the market closed on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;People are just establishing themselves in reasonably safe waters. There is always the fear that there will be major developments while we are closed,&quot; a Munich dealer said.</p>
<p>Chemical giant Bayer AG, trading ex-dividend, fell 2.96 marks, or four percent at 67.24 marks in IBIS trade.</p>
<p>Drugs group Schering AG gained 2.55 marks to 165.50 marks over the day, boosted after revealing plans to buy back its own shares once this is legally feasible.</p>
<p>Electronics and engineering giant Siemens AG continued its recent run of popularity, fuelled by technical buy signals and analyst recommendations, to rise 76 pfennigs to 93.81 marks.</p>
<p>Some dealers were optimistic that the market was well positioned to break out of its current lethargy next week.</p>
<p>More dividend payments are expected in the coming weeks, which should boost liquidity as investors reinvest the payouts.</p>
