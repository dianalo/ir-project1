<title>JAPAN: TOCOM gold plunges after Australian bank sales.</title>
<headline>TOCOM gold plunges after Australian bank sales.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-04</dateline>

<p>Yen-based gold futures tumbled by their daily limits by the close on Friday, following a slump overnight in New York to a 12-year low, triggered by news the Australian central bank had sold 167 tonnes of gold from reserves in recent months, traders said.</p>
<p>All gold futures fell by their 40 yen per gram daily limits. Benchmark April gold closed 40 yen weaker at 1,172 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;The Australian central bank's move dealt another blow to the already bearish sentiment. The yen's further gains in the afternoon prompted investors to liquidate their long positions,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In the spot market, bullion extended losses to stand at $324.00/325.00 per ounce at 0643 GMT, against New York's Thursday close of $325.00/50.</p>
<p>&quot;Private investors who held long positions in gold futures, are expected to face more margin calls if benchmark gold dips by another 10 yen or so. In that case, they will be forced to liquidate their longs,&quot; a commodity brokerage analyst said.</p>
<p>Although it was uncertain whether more central banks will follow Australia's move, fears about central bank's attitude towards gold is likely to make sentiment in the gold market gloomier, they said.  </p>
<p>Platinum group metal (PGM) futures ended narrowly mixed in lacklustre trade as the market continued to await the resumption of Russian exports, the traders said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Russia said its long-awaited PGM exports to Japan would resume around July 10.</p>
<p>Palladium ranged from six yen per gram lower to seven up.</p>
<p>Benchmark June was off two at 529.</p>
<p>Platinum ranged from 20 yen per gram lower to five yen up.</p>
<p>Benchmark June was off three yen at 1,347 yen. Benchmark June silver was off 5.4 yen per 10 grams at 168.5 yen.</p>
