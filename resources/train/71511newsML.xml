<p>The Australian dollar made slight gains through a choppy Monday session as U.S. banks turned buyers for a change, catching a holiday-dulled market short.</p>
<p>Traders reckoned the resilience of support was bullish but cautioned the currency was still short of Friday's US$0.7944 high and confidence would be fragile while that remained so.</p>
<p>A break higher always looked unlikely given that the market had been hollowed out by a holiday in Japan and, in any case, was too obsessed with Tuesday's Federal Reserve policy meeting -- which might well see the first rise in U.S. interest rates in 1-1/2 years -- to pay the local dollar much mind.  </p>
<p>By 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the local dollar was hovering at US$0.7924/29 having wandered between US$0.7913 to US$0.7930 through the session. That was up on Friday's late US$0.7915/20 but shy of important US$0.7945 resistance.</p>
<p>Support was evident at US$0.7910, with more important levels at US$0.7880 and US$0.7865, the latter being last week's low.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the dollar edged up to 87.10/20 yen from an early 87.02/12 and 86.82/92 late Friday, helped by talk another dual currency samurai bond was in the pipeline, and to 1.2020/31 marks from 1.1989/99. In trade weighted terms it firmed to 5.4 from a previous to 58.3 finish.  </p>
<p>Traders said the mark had been pressured both by signs of progress on European Monetary Union (EMU) and by concerns over the health of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>EMU seemed to be step nearer after Europe's top officials agreed the broad outlines for a stability pact to control public spending when monetary union actually came into effect.</p>
<p>That bolstered confidence in higher yielding European currencies, since in effect the Bundesbank was increasingly underwriting their future stability, and took the mark to a near 10-week low at 3.3830/35 French francs from 3.3890/95 in Europe Friday and 3.4045/50 the day before.  </p>
<p>Unease over the potential for political instability in Russia was another concern for the mark as one of the doctors preparing Yeltsin for heart surgery said the operation might have to be delayed or abandoned altogether.</p>
<p>For the local dollar that was a minor factor compared to the risk of a U.S. rate hike, particularly as many analysts were looking for the Reserve Bank to ease Australian policy in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Such a development would see the local currency's yield premium narrow to levels that could choke off Japanese demand for A$ samurais, a major source of support this year.  </p>
<p>The market has been agonising over U.S. policy for months, scrutinising every economic figure and every utterance by Fed officials for clues on when the tightening would come.</p>
<p>Opinion remains deeply divided but dealers figure the market had probably priced in a 0.25 point hike in the Fed funds rate, so such an outcome may only cause temporary weakness in the Australian dollar.</p>
<p>They would be far less sanguine about a 0.50 point rise since that was likely to sharply reduce the yield gap between Australian and U.S. bonds, particularly on 2-yr and 3-yr issues which are the most sensitive ones for Japanese investors.  </p>
<p>Assessing the short term impact of the Fed's decision was not so simple since a hike could well boost the U.S. dollar on the yen and mark, and the local unit might benefit as part of the dollar bloc even while slipping on the U.S. currency itself.</p>
<p>The market will also be keeping a wary eye on the new Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane who this week makes his first public appearance since taking over from Bernie Fraser.</p>
<p>He is speaking at an economists' conference Wednesday on the topic of fiscal and monetary policy interdependence and central bank independence.</p>
