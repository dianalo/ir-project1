<p>That fragrant cafetiere full of strong coffee may be tasty and trendy, but it's probably bad for your heart, Dutch researchers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They found that cafetieres -- which work by plunging the coffee grains down through boiling water, using a metal screen as a filter -- may let harmful chemicals through.</p>
<p>These chemicals act to raise blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which in turn can lead to heart disease, Dr Rob Ugert and colleagues at Wageningen University wrote in the British Medical Journal. They also affect the liver.</p>
<p>Ugert's group looked at earlier Scandinavian studies that found boiled coffee raised blood cholesterol levels. Substances known as cafestol and kahweol were responsible, by raising levels of the liver enzyme, alanine aminotransferase.</p>
<p>They decided to test the effects of newly popular cafetiere coffee. They found 46 healthy men and women aged between 19 and 69 and had them drink five or six strong cups of coffee a day, half made in a cafetiere and half filtered coffee.</p>
<p>After a month they found the volunteers had increased levels of the liver enzyme, sometimes up to 80 percent above normal levels.</p>
<p>&quot;Cafetiere coffee raised low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (LDL or so-called &quot;bad cholesterol') by nine to 14 percent,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Triglyceride concentrations initially rose by 26 percent with cafetiere coffee but returned close to baseline values within six months.&quot;</p>
<p>High LDL and triglyceride levels are linked with heart disease. But all the increases reversed when the volunteers stopped drinking the coffee.</p>
<p>Ugert's group said the high liver enzyme levels might be harmless but high cholesterol levels were not. They said people might think carefully about drinking lots of cafetiere coffee.</p>
<p>Again, cafestol and kahweol were to blame, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;They do not pass through paper filters, which explains why filtered coffee does not raise cholesterol concentrations, but they do occur in other unfiltered coffee brews, such as cafetiere coffee and Turkish coffee,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, high intakes of cafetiere coffee will be associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, similar to that associated with boiled coffee.&quot;</p>
<p>But instant and percolated coffee, with low levels of the subtances, should be less harmful, they said.</p>
