<p>Royal Bank of Scotland said on Thursday that its joint venture deal with supermarket chain Tesco Plc to provide financial services does not rule out a purchase of a building society.</p>
<p>Asked if the deal satisfied Royal Bank's desire to expand its distribution channels into England, and the south-east in particular, Royal Bank chief executive George Mathewson replied, &quot;Certainly not.&quot;</p>
<p>He repeated his often expressed view that if the right opportunity came up, which would enable Royal Bank to extend its customer base at a reasonable price, then it would be interested in buying a building society.</p>
<p>Mathewson declined to comment on whether Royal Bank was holding discussions with any building societies currently.</p>
<p>Royal Bank, which spoke to other stores groups, including Asda, said their was still a lot of preliminary work to do before the joint venture is rolled out.</p>
<p>Mathewson guessed that it would be around six months before the first experimental site was opened and neither side would comment on where this would be or how many would follow.</p>
<p>He said the driving logic behind the deal for Royal Bank was to increase its market presence in England which currently stands at a lowly 3-1/2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know exactly how customers will react to different products sold through different distribution channels,&quot; Mathewson said. &quot;I don't expect people to change their current account, but they could take out a second account.&quot;</p>
<p>Mathewson said the credit card to be launched by the joint venture, which also includes Royal Bank's direct insurance unit Direct Line and Scottish Widows, would not bear its Advanta brand name but would be significantly cheaper than cards offered by the large English banks. -- Joe Ortiz, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717.</p>
