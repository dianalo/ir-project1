<title>EGYPT: Israel's Weizman meets Mubarak on peace mission.</title>
<headline>Israel's Weizman meets Mubarak on peace mission.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1996-10-14</dateline>

<p>Israeli President Ezer Weizman met Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Monday to try to ease the strain the Jewish state's hardline policies have put on relations with its Arab neighbours.</p>
<p>Mubarak welcomed Weizman at Cairo airport and then the two leaders went to the Ittihadiya presidential palace for talks.</p>
<p>Mubarak has said Egyptians are furious with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's radical policies towards peace and are calling for a boycott of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Egypt is the most influential Arab state and in 1979 it became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel.</p>
<p>Weizman, whose office is by law largely ceremonial, has said his role in Egypt would be to &quot;heal certain splits, which everyone sees, with the largest Arab country, and I think we can find a number of directions for improved relations.&quot;</p>
<p>Mubarak has repeatedly called on Netanyahu to honour peace pledges signed with the Palestinans. The Israeli prime minister has been trying to renegotiate them.</p>
<p>Mubarak told reporters on Saturday he had told Netanyahu he would not meet him unless Israeli troops withdrew from the West Bank town of Hebron as stipulated in previous agreements.</p>
<p>The Egyptian leader even refused to attend an emergency summit in Washington earlier this month because he did not believe Netanyahu would change his position.</p>
<p>Weizman was a key architect of the Camp David peace accords signed by Egypt and Israel in 1978.</p>
