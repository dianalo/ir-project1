<p>The New York State Comptroller faulted bridge repairs by New York City's Department of Transportation for being shoddy and taking too long, the Daily News said in its Wednesday edition.</p>
<p>The paper, citing an unreleased audit by Comptroller H. Carl McCall, said the repairs often were patchwork solutions that failed to deal with underlying structural problems, like covering gaping holes in roadways with steel plates.</p>
<p>Auditors charged such practices, which were used by the Williamsburg Bridge, the Fresh Creek Bridge over the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn and at other locations, posed a &quot;clear and present danger to the traveling public,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>According to the News, other findings from the audit, which ran from July 1993 to January 1996, showed:</p>
<p>--At the Mill Basin Bridge in Brooklyn, which also spans the Belt, the city found three to five inches of corrosion in five concrete columns in 1992. By 1995, there were seven inches of rot in the supporting concrete of 11 bridge columns.</p>
<p>--At the Williamsburg Bridge between Brooklyn and Manhattan, at least one &quot;red flag,&quot; the most serious structural flaw, &quot;was covered up, not resolved.&quot; The problem, a hole in a pedestrian sidewalk, was dealt with by covering the hole with a steel plate.</p>
<p>Aides to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who are fighting the Democratic state comptroller over audits that the Republican mayor says are politically motivated, attacked the findings.</p>
<p>The paper quoted the city Transportation Commissioner Christopher Lynn as saying: &quot;What Carl McCall will not tell you is that Mayor Giuliani inherited 866 aging bridges that were victims of generations of neglect by the established politial leaders of this city.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;They were all crumbling until the mayor said, 'Let's fix them.' &quot;</p>
