<p>Yugoslavia's 1997 wheat crop could fall below the latest government estimate of 3.0 million tonnes if rains continue during the harvest month, the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is changing from day to day. We have not had such a difficult harvest in the past 20 years,&quot; Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce Vice President Milutin Cirovic told a meeting of the chamber's board of directors.</p>
<p>Frequent and heavy rains in July have slowed harvesting and reduced both average yield and grain quality.</p>
<p>In the granary region of Vojvodina, storms and hail had damaged or completely destroyed wheat on some 30,000 hectares out of Yugoslavia's total wheat area of 817,600 ha.</p>
<p>Serbian Agriculture Minister Jovan Babovic said on Monday wheat had been reaped from around 480,000 ha, or 58 percent of Serbia's wheat area, by July 21. Babovic stuck to earlier wheat crop forecasts of 3.0 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Montenegro, Serbia's partner in Yugoslavia, accounts for just 2,200 ha of the wheat area.</p>
<p>&quot;With 125 milimetres of rainfall registered over the past 20 days, we are in a situation today where yield continues declining,&quot; Cirovic said.</p>
<p>Yield varied greatly from less than 3.0 tonnes per hectare to 7.0, with the average for the crop harvested so far 3.76 tonnes per ha, the chamber said in its latest report.</p>
<p>The chamber estimated that this year's crop of 2.8-3.0 million tonnes would meet the country's needs until the next harvest, leaving some 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes for export.</p>
<p>&quot;But yield could decline further since grain quality is deteriorating as the harvest progresses. If rains continue at such intensity we may be brought into a situation to reap wheat for fodder rather than bread,&quot; Cirovic said.</p>
<p>An official of the federal Agriculture Ministry on Friday forecast a surplus of up to 600,000 tonnes from a 1997 wheat crop estimated at around three million tonnes.</p>
<p>Around 40 percent of the wheat in warehouses so far has had to be dried, which raises the price by 0.08 to 0.10 dinars per kg, Cirovic said.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav government set the guaranteed price for the 1997 crop at 1.00 dinars for first, 0.90 dinars for second and 0.80 dinars for third quality wheat.</p>
<p>Some 550,000 tonnes of wheat were purchased in advance before the harvest began -- 356,000 tonnes by the Serbian Commodity Reserve Agency, 40,000 tonnes by wheat milling organisations, 130,000 tonnes by banks and firms and 20,000 tonnes by traders and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The remaining market surplus not yet contracted for delivery is seen at around 1.6 million tonnes, including 100,000 tonnes of seed wheat.</p>
<p>Trade in wheat is regulated by the government and limited to commodity reserves, milling organisations, seed wheat firms and companies authorised by the commodity reserve agency.</p>
