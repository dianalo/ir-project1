<p>UNESCO on Saturday called on the international community to implement a &quot;new water ethic&quot; to rationalise the use of water while another U.N. official said Africa needed to invest billions of dollars in irrigation to meet growing food demands.</p>
<p>UNESCO's Director-General Federico Mayor, speaking at a World Water Forum of scientists and experts from 50 countries, said the world was at a turning point where things could either get better or worse depending on what action was taken.</p>
<p>&quot;The warning signs are clear... Severe water scarcity in many regions of the world, falling water tables, shrinking rivers and lakes, widespread pollution and creeping desertification,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To avoid a water crisis in the future, we have to urgently address the problem at source, to promote a new attitude to water...To establish a new water ethic.&quot;</p>
<p>The Marrakesh meeting, which ends on Saturday evening, will issue recommendations on water use, officials said.</p>
<p>The managing director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Jacques Diouf, told the gathering that Africa had to invest $72 billion to boost irrigated areas to meet demand for food in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;It is urgent that African countries give priority to investment in the water sector,&quot; he said, proposing that Africa boost its irrigated areas up to 41 million hectares (101 million acres) from the existing 17 million hectares (42 million acres).</p>
<p>With one billion people already lacking access to clean water and adequate food, the world population is expected to grow from 5.5 billion to 8.5 billion by the year 2025, which will generate need and increase water consumption, reports show.</p>
<p>Diouf suggested the money for expanding irrigated areas could come from internal and external financing.</p>
<p>&quot;In Africa, in the last 30 years, agricultural production increased by two percent per year while the population grew by three percent,&quot; the FAO said.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa is the only continent where agricultural output per inhabitant dropped in the same period,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Mayor said that total demand for water increased seven-fold between 1900 and 1990 while irrigated areas grew six-fold over the same period.</p>
<p>Demand for water this century has increased at twice the rate of population growth, Mayor said, adding this was due to changes in lifestyle linked to economic development.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a bad news in as much as demand will continue to accelerate as living standards worldwide hopefully improve...To provide for foreseeble future needs, water resources development and management must be placed at the top of national and international agenda as part of a global strategy,&quot; Mayor said.</p>
