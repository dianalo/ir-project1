<p>Crude tanker chartering in the all important Middle East Gulf market was good after the fair start to the week. But the rejuvenation did not herald a rise in rates, brokers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, three VLCCs had been seen, with two finding employment to the East. Shell's chartering of the Knock More at W47.5 was seen as typical of the Gulf-Singapore/East rates.</p>
<p>Brokers said VLCC trips to Japan were a touch softer at W55, off W2.5 from last done levels.</p>
<p>Vessels travelling to the West could command around W48.  </p>
<p>Rates for 80,000 tonners going cross-Med fell fractionally to W95, as evidenced by OMV's chartering of the Frankopan travelling Libya-Trieste. But brokers said that as low as W92.5 had been seen done.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an abundance of vessels in this region, with more returning this week. It is possible that rates may drop slightly lower,&quot; said an Italian broker.</p>
<p>In the inter-UKC sector rates ascended to W95, up W2.5 points, as tonnage availability tightened.</p>
<p>Two transatlantic trips were seen, with Statoil and J.P. Morgan both chartering vessels.  </p>
<p>Caribbean rates for 70,000 tonners going upcoast-U.S. fell to W142.5 from W147.5, though as low as W140 was seen done.</p>
<p>The West African theatre saw rates rise for VLCC to W64-65 from W60 as charterers competed for thinning tonnage. Suezmax rates suffered as the bigger ships picked up business.</p>
<p>Fuel oil chartering in the UKC continued to see steady rates of around W210 on 25,000 tonners, the same level as in the Med.</p>
<p>UKC activity was focussed on the Baltic, with one shipping broker noting difficulty in finding a tanker for a north Spain pick-up.</p>
