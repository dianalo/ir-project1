<p>Austria's coalition parties, meeting outside Vienna for two days of closed talks, said on Tuesday they had made significant progress towards agreement on the 1998 and 1999 budgets.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, a member of Chancellor Viktor Klima's Social Democrats, told state radio the government needed to cut another seven billion billion schillings from projected spending next year.</p>
<p>He was seeking to raise an additional 10 billion schillings in annual revenues by closing tax loopholes.</p>
<p>&quot;These are manageable sums,&quot; Edlinger said after talks with Economy Minister Hannes Farnleitner, a member of the conservative People's Party.</p>
<p>Discussions were to continue later on Tuesday in this small town on the shore of Lake Neusiedl between Austria and Hungary.</p>
<p>Edlinger said his budget proposals were based on economic growth of 2.2 percent in 1998 and 2.8 percent in 1999. He will present his 1998 and 1999 budgets to the cabinet on July 22.</p>
<p>The finance ministry is keen to ensure that Austria's budget deficit and gross debt remain comfortably within Maastricht's limits.</p>
<p>Edlinger reiterated that Austria would meet the grade this year for Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget, sealed only after a bitter coalition row and snap general election, foresees a central government budget deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP and a declining debt ratio of just above 60 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are on course and we will have no problem with the Maastricht criteria,&quot; Edlinger said, describing economic conditions as favourable.</p>
<p>He announced plans to boost government revenue by slashing the duty free import allowance for cigarettes from eastern Europe. In future travellers will be permitted to bring in just 25 cigarettes, down from 200.</p>
<p>&quot;That will bring the government an extra three billion schillings annually,&quot; he said.</p>
