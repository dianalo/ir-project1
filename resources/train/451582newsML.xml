<p>China said on Tuesday that the problem of Hwang Jang-yop, the most senior official to flee North Korea, had been basically solved.</p>
<p>&quot;What I can tell you is that through consultations among all sides, the problem has already basically been solved,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese side will formally make an announcement,&quot; Cui said, but did not say when.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a senior military officer said the North Korean defector, who spent nearly five weeks holed out in South Korea's consulate office in Beijing, was among four passengers who arrived at the Philippines' Clark airbase after a flight from the Chinese port of Xiamen.</p>
<p>The officer, who asked not to be identified, said a helicopter immediately flew Hwang and his companions to the northern mountain resort city of Baguio.</p>
