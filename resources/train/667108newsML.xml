<p>The Senate Finance Committee chairman Tuesday took his turn at proposing a way to cut taxes by $85 billion over five years with a plan that differed from legislation proposed in the House.</p>
<p>Sen. William Roth, a Delaware Republican, offered a bill filling in details of the tax portion of a budget agreement reached by congressional leaders and the White House last month. Similar to legislation approved by the House Ways and Means Committee last week, it included a child tax credit, higher education tax initiatives, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax relief and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts.</p>
<p>But it differed on some specifics. Any differences between House and Senate legislation must eventually be worked out before tax legislation is sent to the president.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee was to consider Roth's bill Thursday when members will be allowed to offer amendments.</p>
<p>&quot;This tax relief package is a combination of some of the best ideas from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue,&quot; Roth said. &quot;This is a bipartisan effort, and it is only through continued bipartisanship that we will deliver this relief to the American taxpayer.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House has criticised the House bill and all Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee voted against it.</p>
<p>But Senate Democratic aides say Democrats had input into Roth's legislation and did not plan to put together their own tax cut proposal as their counterparts in the House did.</p>
<p>The biggest piece of the tax cut would be $81 billion for a $500-per-child tax credit for children under age 17. If the child is aged 13 to 16, the tax credit must be deposited in an IRA-type account earmarked for education.</p>
<p>As in the House legislation, the Roth bill would provide a credit of 50 percent of up to $3,000 of college tuition, and 75 percent of up to $2,000 for students attending community colleges and technical schools.</p>
<p>The community college provision was not in the House bill and would address White House criticism that if it were just 50 percent of $3,000 it would penalise students going to less expensive institutions. President Clinton had proposed a straight $1,500 college tuition tax credit.</p>
<p>Both the Roth and House bills would cut the capital gains tax rate to 20 percent from a maximum 28 percent for individuals. But Roth's proposal would not touch the capital gains tax for corporations, while the House bill would gradually reduce it to 30 percent from 35 percent.</p>
<p>Both bills would gradually raise the threshold at which the estate tax is imposed to $1 million from the current $600,000. But Roth's bill would also immediately exclude up to $1 million from the estate tax for a family farm or business that comprised more than 50 percent of the estate.</p>
<p>Roth proposed funding for Amtrak, the rail service, at a cost of $2.3 billion over five years, paid for with a half-cent of the 4.3 cents per gallon gasoline tax.</p>
<p>The legislation would raise $53 billion over five years in tax increases and other revenue raisers, more than the $46 billion in the House bill. Revenue raisers included extension of the airline ticket tax but would reduce the tax rate to 7.5 percent from 10 percent for flights in certain rural areas.</p>
<p>Roth's bill would repeal the current $6 departure tax and impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of an international ticket price attributable to flight through U.S. airspace.</p>
<p>There was no provision to eliminate the ethanol tax break for farmers, as was in the House legislation.</p>
