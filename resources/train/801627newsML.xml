<headline>Toronto stocks fall one pct, but avoid Dow selloff.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks avoided following a sharp sell-off on Wall Street, but still fell by more than one percent on Friday, led by heavy losses in banking, transport and conglomerates.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index surrendered 71.76 points, or 1.06 percent, to finish at 6695.09.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 million shares were traded worth C$1.22 billion ($877 million).</p>
<p>In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by over 247 points, its second biggest point loss ever.</p>
<p>&quot;It's about time. It's way overdue. I think the high multiple stocks are getting hit and momentum is changing a bit,&quot; said Montreal-based strategist Bill Ram.</p>
<p>The transport sector was hardest hit, dropping nearly two percent, followed by financial services, conglomerates and base metals.</p>
<p>There were modest gains in gold and precious metals, up 31 points, and consumer products.</p>
<p>Declining stocks battered advances 587 to 368 with 297 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>Ram said there was no specific news to spark today's decline, but a seven to 10 percent correction in the near term would be healthy for equity markets which have soared so high.</p>
