<p>Adam Hollioake and Graham Thorpe effectively countered the menace of Shane Warne on Thursday to guide England to an ultimately comfortable six-wicket win over Australia in the first one-day international.</p>
<p>Under black skies on a chill Yorkshire day, England scored 175 for four from 40.1 overs after restricting Australia to an inadequate 170 for eight from their 50 overs.</p>
<p>Hollioake, who came to the wicket with England a shaky 40 for four, overcame a hesitant start to score a pugnacious, unbeaten 66.</p>
<p>He took a four and a six from consecutive Warne deliveries and ended the match by lofting Jason Gillespie over square leg for another six.</p>
<p>His maiden international half-century and a useful two for 22 from five overs late in the Australian innings won him the man-of-the-match award.</p>
<p>&quot;I started off a bit nervously,&quot; said the Australian-born all-rounder. &quot;I think I'm a jittery starter. Graham Thorpe gave me confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>Thorpe top-scored with an unbeaten 75, his fourth half-century in England's last six one-day internationals and his 12th overall. He hit seven fours but more importantly shored up the England innings when Australia seemed about to seize the initiative.</p>
<p>Warne switched ends twice but neither the weather nor the pitch were conducive to wrist spin and he eventually went for 46 from 10 overs without capturing a wicket.</p>
<p>After Mike Atherton had asked Australia to bat, his Australian counterpart Mark Taylor was quickly in to his stride.</p>
<p>Taylor square-drove a wayward Phil DeFreitas for four off the fifth ball of the innings but his miserable run in international cricket continued when he was caught behind off Darren Gough for seven, waving the bat outside the off-stump with minimal footwork.</p>
<p>Gough, at his exuberant best, took two for 33 from 10 overs while Robert Croft gave an excellent exhibition of controlled off-spin, conceding only 16 runs from his 10 overs.</p>
<p>&quot;He bowled a very good line,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;He reminds me of (former Australian off-spinner) Tim May.&quot;</p>
<p>Michael Bevan, a familiar figure at Headingley after his two years with Yorkshire, was the top scorer with 30 and the Australian total seemed at the time to be at least 50 too few.</p>
<p>Glenn McGrath, bowling with real menace, gave England an early scare by dismissing Nick Knight (12) and Alec Stewart (seven) before Surrey pair Thorpe and Hollioake rode to the rescue.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we played the first part of the game exceptionally well,&quot; Atherton said. &quot;Our fielding has improved tremendously this winter. Our close fielding and catching is second to none.&quot;</p>
<p>As always, Taylor was generous in defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;I just think we were outplayed today, full stop,&quot; he said. &quot;They bowled with more passion and fire today. We will have to lift the pace.&quot;</p>
<p>The teams travel to London on Friday for the final two one-day internationals at The Oval on Saturday and Lord's on Sunday.</p>
