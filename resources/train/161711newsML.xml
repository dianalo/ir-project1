<headline>ROMANIA VOTES IN THIRD POST-COMMUNIST ELECTIONS.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1996-11-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Romania's third post-communist general election is on Sunday. The vote will form the poor Balkan country's political shape until the end of the century.</p>
<p>Following are key facts about Romania:</p>
<p>POPULATION: 22.66 million. This includes 1.6 million Hungarians (7.1 percent), 400,000 Gypsies (1.8 percent), 119,000 Germans (0.5 percent).</p>
<p>RELIGION: Most Romanians (some 86.8 percent) belong to the country's Orthodox Church. Five percent of the population are Roman Catholics, 3.5 percent Reformed Church, and one percent Greek-Catholics. There are 9,000 Jews under a chief rabbi.</p>
<p>LANGUAGE: The official language is Romanian.</p>
<p>AREA: 237,500 sq km (91,699 sq miles). Romania is bounded north and northeast by Ukraine and Moldova, east by the Black Sea, south by Bulgaria, southwest by former Yugoslavia and northwest by Hungary.</p>
<p>CAPITAL: Bucharest (population 2.06 million).</p>
<p>ARMED FORCES: Romania was a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance during the Cold War. It has officially applied for membership of NATO, begun military reform and joined the alliance's Partnership for Peace programme.</p>
<p>Total armed forces: Active: 217,400 (104,700 conscripts). Army: 128,800 (84,700 conscripts), Navy: 19,000 (10,000 conscripts), Air force: 54,000 (10,000 conscripts). Total Military reservists: 427,000 (army 400,000, navy 6,000, air force 21,000), Paramilitary Border Guards: 22,300 (11,700 conscripts), Interior ministry gendarmerie: 10,000.</p>
<p>Conscripts serve a year in the army and air force and 18 months in the navy.</p>
<p>ECONOMY: Per capita GDP was $1,570 in 1995, down from $2,446 in 1980. Romania, potentially one of Europe's richest farm areas with ample crude oil supplies, was reduced to one of the region's poorest states by a bungled industrial self-sufficiency policy under communism. President Nicolae Ceausescu cleared Romania's $11 billion foreign debt in the 1980s in an all-out repayment drive that throttled imports of industrial equipment and diverted food to export.</p>
<p>After his fall in December 1989, there was an abrupt decline until October 1992 when modern market systems such as free pricing, private enterprise and a semi-floating exchange rate were introduced. Trade began to recover in 1992 but the country expects a $1 billion trade deficit in 1996.</p>
<p>Private enterprise now makes up 45 percent of GDP and external trade and more than half the country's retail business. But under Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, appointed in November 1992, privatisation of state sector industry made little progress. A mass-selloff scheme of some 4,000 state enterprises got to its final stage this year and the stock exchange opened in November 1995.</p>
<p>Red-tape and lack of industrial reform has frightened off foreign investors who have put only $2 billion into Romania in seven years. After soaring inflation of 300 percent in 1993, Romania cut the figure back to 27.8 percent in 1995. But pre-election largesse has pushed inflation to a year-on-year 45.3 percent in September. Unemployment, unknown under communists, is still low at 5.9 percent in September 1996.</p>
<p>Relations with the International Monetary Fund, good in 1994 when Romania signed a stand-by loan accord, have soured this year over slow structural reforms and budget laxity.</p>
<p>In 1993 Romania struck an association deal with the European Union. This year the U.S. granted Romania permanent &quot;most favoured nation&quot; trading status and the country expects to join the Central European Free Trade Agreement next year.</p>
<p>HISTORY: Romania was formerly a loose alliance of principalities in Wallachia, Moldova and Transylvania, which were prey to the territorial rivalry of Austro-Hungary, Russia and Turkey. It formally became a kingdom under a Hohenzollern monarch in 1881 and it fought the Germans in World War One.</p>
<p>In the inter-war years constitutional monarchy prevailed. In World War Two Romania fought on the Axis side under dictator Marshal Ion Antonescu and Moscow seized a swathe of Romanian territory, part of which is now in Ukraine and part in Moldova.</p>
<p>When the Red Army reached the Romanian border in 1944 King Michael arrested the marshal and joined the allies. Initially the king was on good terms with Moscow but the communists forced him to abdicate in 1947 and banished him abroad.</p>
<p>Romania was under communist dictatorship from 1947 to 1989 when Ceausescu was deposed by party dissidents and army officers and shot in a bloody popular uprising.</p>
<p>The National Salvation Front, led by former Ceausescu aide Ion Iliescu, took power, abolished the communist state and held elections in May 1990, which the Front won. Iliescu captured the presidency. Since then, several outbursts of political violence have rocked Romania. Critics blame Iliescu.</p>
<p>In December 1991 Romania formally became a French-style presidential republic under a new constitution.</p>
<p>In September 1991 NSF Prime Minister Petre Roman was ousted by coalminer-led riots. September 1992 elections saw Iliescu retain the presidency and his renamed Party of Social Democracy win a 34 percent simple majority.</p>
<p>Vacaroiu has since led a minority left-wing cabinet dependent on hardline nationalist and communists to survive.</p>
<p>Romania has made joining NATO and the European Union its foreign policy priority. REUTER</p>
