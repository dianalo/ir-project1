<p>Shares in UK fashion retailer Next Plc were seen higher on Wednesday after yearly profits towards the top end of market expectations and an upbeat statement on current trading, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The figures look pretty good and the trading statement is quite positive,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;They have obviously had a good start to the year and things are looking pretty positive.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock was up 9p at 605 by 0825 GMT in volume of 101,668 shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;The figures are very much at the top end,&quot; said another dealer, &quot;and the particularly encouraging thing is the 38 percent rise in sales at the Next Directory catalogue unit.&quot;</p>
<p>However there were doubts about whether the results would prove strong enough to drive the stock much higher in the short term, having rallied from a year's low of 522p on January 10.</p>
<p>&quot;They have had a good run ahead of the figures and there could be some profit-taking short-term,&quot; said one dealer.  </p>
<p>Dealers also pointed out that Next shares have shown little net improvement through the past six months.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some small increases in forecasts after these results but the stock is already trading at a premium (in its price-earnings ratio) to the rest of the sector, which is justified but it's hard to see it going much higher,&quot; the first dealer said.</p>
<p>Other leading retailers were boosted by the results, with Marks &amp; Spencer Plc up 7p at 471-1/2 by 0835 GMT and Great Universal Stores Plc up 6p at 650.  </p>
<p>Next's pre-tax profit rose to 158.8 million stg from 141.9 million a year before, against analyst expectations between 125.3 million and 162.0 million, on sales up 22 percent at 947 million. The dividend was raised 28 percent to 15p, as expected.</p>
<p>Chairman Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale said sales were up 24 percent at the start of the current year with selling space up seven percent.</p>
<p>By 0840 GMT Next shares were up 20-1/2p at 616-1/2 in volume of 510,059 shares.</p>
