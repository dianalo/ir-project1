<p>African financial leaders criticised on Monday a new international debt relief initiative as too rigid and said it ignored countries genuinely burdened by debt.</p>
<p>At the opening of a conference of African finance ministers and major lenders, African delegates said conditions and the criteria for the initiative meant many poor countries would not benefit fully.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank approved in March a debt relief plan for Uganda, making it the first candidate of the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Countries.</p>
<p>Kingsley Amoako, executive-secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, called for the initiative to be applied in a flexible manner and to maintain the right focus to succeed.</p>
<p>&quot;The initiative could look good on paper but not benefit as many African countries as are genuinely burdened by debt and deserve assistance,&quot; Amoako told the conference in Addis Ababa</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to have doubts about the initiative's conditionality and eligibility criteria,&quot; said Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Kassu Ilala.</p>
<p>Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said despite reforms, most African countries had failed to ensure sound financial management and debt &quot;severely undermined African economies&quot;.</p>
<p>He urged Africans on the world's poorest continent to avoid excessive international financial dependency and said flows of trade to Africa had failed to materialise despite economic reforms.</p>
<p>Amoako said major problems with the initiative included restrictive criteria on which countries were eligible, especially on the debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports ratios, the failure to consider the fiscal burden as a central problem in sustaining debt, and a lack of commitment to adequate amounts of financing and timing mainly by bilateral donors.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa's debt ratio reached 270 percent in 1995 and shows no signs of abating. Resources devoted to debt servicing are painfully diverted from supporting economic activities underpinning growth, according to Ethiopia's Kassu.</p>
<p>&quot;In some cases, debt servicing is taking up to 90 percent of budgetary resources, and in spite of our efforts to repay what we can, arrears continue to accumulate,&quot; Kassu said.</p>
<p>Africa's international debt stands at around $340 billion.</p>
<p>In general, a country is required under the initiative to establish a six-year record with IMF tutorship that shows strong economic reform efforts, although substantial flexibility is provided on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>The initiative was undertaken when it became clear that the repayment of old loans to lending agencies such as the World Bank and IMF was draining some of the poorest countries, making it impossible for them to get on their feet no matter what reform efforts they made.</p>
<p>Others countries identified as likely candidates under the initiative are Mozambique, Burkina Faso and the Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>There is a growing consensus that Uganda could get its relief between April and November of next year. The initiative could lead to a reduction of $385 million of Uganda's $3.4 billion international debt.</p>
