<p>Serbian authorities on Tuesday denied they had mistreated an opposition supporter arrested on Friday for carrying an effigy of President Slobodan Milosevic during demonstrations but did say he needed medical treatment.</p>
<p>In an official statement, the justice ministry said Dejan Bulatovic had been treated in the same way as every other prisoner and &quot;did not have any objections to the way he was treated&quot;.</p>
<p>Bulatovic was sentenced to 25 days jail. Independent media alleged he was savagely beaten by police, fanning the anger of hundreds of thousands of protestors who have taken to the streets of Belgrade and other Serbian towns daily for the past two weeks to protest against Milosevic's rule.</p>
<p>But the statement did say that Bulatovic, 21, a worker from the northeastern town of Sid, had been examined by health authorities, including a central Belgrade clinic, on three occasions after his arrest.</p>
<p>&quot;If the need for further health treatment should arise the justice ministry will undertake all measures necessary for his full health protection,&quot; the statement carried by the state news agency Tanjug said.</p>
<p>Bulatovic's mother has claimed her son was beaten by police during which his nose was broken, he was forced to lie naked on the concrete floor of his prison cell with an open window and a gun barrel was forced into his mouth.</p>
<p>In an open letter, Belgrade students accused police of &quot;Gestapo methods&quot;.</p>
<p>Bulatovic was one of about 100 protesters the opposition says have been detained for taking part in a wave of protests against the government's move to overturn last month's municipal elections, which the opposition claims it won.</p>
