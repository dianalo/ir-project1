<p>Brazil could delay further its planned deregulation of the hydrous alcohol sector as a large consumer base should persuade the state to provide subsidies for continued availability, Czarnikow Sugar said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In its latest montly report, Czarnikow said scrapping rates of cars powered by hydrous ethanol were around 20,000 a month while new purchases had slipped under 500 since June.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be difficult to gauge the likely decay rate for the hydrous ethanol fleet although eventually there will come a point when the decline will become more precipitous,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime those owners with cars in good condition are currently locked in by poorer second-hand values and, with fuel widely available, would see little advantage in taking this loss early.&quot;</p>
<p>Czarnikow said the owners of the cars with dedicated engines burning the hydrous ethanol -- which requires a heavy government subsidy -- were likely to continue to run their cars until maintentance costs became excessive.</p>
<p>&quot;The existing broad user base is therefore likely to continue past the revised deadline for liberalisation (May 1998) and it remains likely that further deferments in deregulation may be brought in beyond the latest extension,&quot; it added. Last week the Brazilian government announced that support prices would continue for hydrous alcohol until May 1, 1998. Earlier this year, the government said the end of subsidies and price controls from the start of 1997, as part of a general liberalisation of fuel prices.</p>
<p>But ethanol distillers, used to being bankrolled by the government under the 20-year-old Proalcool programme, said they needed more time to prepare themselves.</p>
<p>Czarnikow said the sector's lack of support could have dragged usage down to negligible levels by 2005, adding that the government would probably maintain the statutory requirement for all petrol to contain a blend of anhydrous ethanol.</p>
<p>The price liberalisation of anhydrous ethanol, which is blended at 22 percent with all Brazil's petrol at 22 percent to produce gasohol for conventional engines, has been deferred to May 1, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;A further factor in the longer term is whether the government's state policy of transferring state controls to the private sector will at some stage involve the state oil company, Petrobras,&quot; the report added.</p>
