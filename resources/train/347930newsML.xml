<p>Restructuring efforts by European oil refiners to boost profitability look set to wane after last year's scheduled closure or sale of five percent of the continent's refining capacity, according to a leading oil consultancy.</p>
<p>An improvement in profit margins last year from 1995's lows is expected to reinforce oil companies' reluctance to close plants, said Paris-based Enerfinance in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;The cost of closing a refinery is too high, and the (improved) refining margins seen in 1996 will doubtless act as a deterrent to further closures.&quot;</p>
<p>Calls within the industry for the closure of up to 60 million tonnes, or 10 percent, of European refining capacity may have been overstated, Enerfinance said.</p>
<p>&quot;The current refining context does not require capacities to be cut to the order of 50 to 60 million tonnes, contrary to the claims of certain operators,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Refining margins for a Rotterdam refinery averaged $2.00 a barrel in 1996, their highest level in four years, and a 75 cents improvement on 1995, Enerfinance estimated.</p>
<p>It forecast profits this year in the region of $1.60 to $2.00 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;The most probable scenario is a drop in margins in the spring of 1997...followed by an upturn which would become stronger in 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite fears among refiners of handing over competitive advantage to competitors by closing down plants, last year brought commitments to close or sell nearly 30 million tonnes of capacity.</p>
<p>British Petroleum Co Plc set the ball rolling in January by announcing the closure of the Nerefco section of the Pernis refinery in Rotterdam, a capacity cut of 3.5 million tonnes (70,000 barrels per day).</p>
<p>BP also expressed a desire to find a partner or even divest in its 210,000 bpd Lavera refinery in southern France. Shell announced plans in December to sell its 60,000 bpd Swiss Cressier refinery.</p>
<p>Kuwait Petroleum's 60,000 bpd Danish refinery and Chevron's 115,000 bpd Pembroke, U.K. plant also received death sentences last year, while capacity is to be slashed by 60,000 bpd at Exxon's plant in Karlsruhe, Germany.</p>
<p>Enerfinance is not expecting another flurry of refinery closure announcements in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Further restructuring will be slow,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>But some moves to address regional imbalances in refining capacity may be on the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of equilibrium, notably on a regional level, is paramount, Germany and Southern France are regions with the greatest disequilibrium,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>With a surplus of at least one half of a refinery, France suffers from particularly low margins as there is strong competition from other energy sources.</p>
<p>Shell operates a refinery at Berre L'Etang, one of four refineries around the Mediterranean port of Marseilles. The company is exploring options with its three regional competitors Esso France, Total and BP France.</p>
<p>In Germany, the Leuna 200 refinery, due onstream in autumn 1997, is set to add some 170,000 bpd to the country's refining capacity.</p>
<p>Scheduled closures at Karlsruhe and the old Leuna unit, coupled with rising demand for gas oil and diesel, should ensure that the overall supply/demand balance in Germany will not radically change, Enerfinance said.</p>
<p>But this may not be the case on a regional level.</p>
<p>&quot;The south of Germany...can reasonably be expected to suffer from the increase of capacities at Leuna...it is possible that refiners will be forced to either close a plant or restructure,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>First in line for the chop is the Schwedt refinery located close to Leuna.</p>
<p>&quot;Schwedt may see its very survival questioned if the Polish market does not open up to absorb its surplus.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps fortunately for Schwedt, plans to build a new 120,000 bpd refinery in southern Poland appear to have faltered amid problems of finding a strategic investor and obtaining necessary government approvals, Enerfinance said.</p>
