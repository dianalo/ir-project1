<p>U.S. officials on Sunday said they were putting the final touches to a visit President Bill Clinton will make to Mexico May 5-7, the first of a series he plans to make to Latin America.</p>
<p>Thomas &quot;Mack&quot; McLarty, special adviser to Clinton, was scheduled to meet Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria and other Mexican officials on Sunday and Monday to finalize details of the Clinton visit.</p>
<p>Clinton will meet Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and join him for a news conference. There are also plans for him to give a speech, White House officials said earlier.</p>
<p>McLarty told reporters Mexico and the United States needed to work together to fight drug trafficking.</p>
<p>&quot;Our progress as sovereign nations is being threatened today by a variety of dark and evil forces including narcotics corruption, crime and international terrorism,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States certified Mexico as a U.S. ally in the war against illegal drugs in February despite protests from some members of Congress that Mexico's record was inadequate.</p>
<p>Clinton's anti-drug czar, retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, was in Mexico City on Wednesday for talks on drug policy, a key issue on Clinton's agenda during his Mexican visit.</p>
<p>The week-long trip will also take Clinton to Costa Rica to attend a Central American summit and then to Barbados for a Caribbean summit.</p>
<p>Clinton's visit had been planned for this month but was delayed after he tore a knee tendon at the Florida home of golfer Greg Norman on March 14 and underwent surgery.</p>
<p>Clinton will travel to at least seven countries on three trips to the Caribbean and Latin America over the next year, McLarty said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that it is appropriate and highly symbolic that Mexico be the first stop on President Clinton's hemispheric journey,&quot; McLarty said.</p>
