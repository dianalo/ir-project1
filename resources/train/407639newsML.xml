<title>USA: Criteria set for viewing Oklahoma bomb telecast.</title>
<headline>Criteria set for viewing Oklahoma bomb telecast.</headline>
<dateline>DENVER 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Oklahoma City bombing victims who want to view a closed-circuit telecast of the trials will be asked if they suffered physical or emotional injury or financial loss, according to questionnaires made public on Thursday.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 victims may be vying for 330 seats in a Federal Aviation Administration facility in Oklahoma City where the telecast will be shown. Congress mandated a closed-circuit telecast of the trials only for victims who are unable, because of expense and inconvenience, to attend the trials in Denver.</p>
<p>Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols are charged in the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that claimed the lives of 168 people and injured several hundred.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch moved the trials to Denver, saying the defendants could not get fair hearings in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The forms ask victims whether they suffered physical or emotional injury such as the death or injury of a relative. Victims also are asked if they sustained financial loss from the closure of a business or bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has recommended to Matsch that eligible victims be allowed to attend the telecast on a rotating basis so more of them can watch during the trials which are expected to last several months.</p>
<p>McVeigh's trial begins on March 31. A date for Nichols' trial has not been set.</p>
