<p>Congressional Democrats said on Thursday Republicans planned to accuse Clinton administration officials of making possible criminal false statements on U.S. policy on Iran arming the Bosnians in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is an outrage,&quot; the House of Representatives International Relations Committee Democrats said. They said a Republican-controlled select international relations subcommittee planned to make the charge of possible criminal false statements to Congress at a news conference on Thursday on its investigation of the Iran arms affair.</p>
<p>Administration officials testified at hearings that they decided in 1994 neither to approve nor oppose Iranian weapons for Moslem-led Bosnian government forces because they feared Bosnia would collapse without the arms.</p>
<p>Republicans say the policy was a deception because the administration publicly opposed arms for Bosnia at the time and charge that it allowed Iran to gain influence in Bosnia.</p>
<p>The Democrats, led by Indiana Representative Lee Hamilton, senior Democrat on the full committee, said on Thursday: &quot;We have reviewed the evidence. It is our belief that no laws were broken, no wrongdoing occurred, no covert actions took place, no false statements given, no U.S. interests were harmed.&quot;</p>
<p>They said the charge of false statements was based on discrepancies in the testimony of various officials, which they suggested were understandable differences in memories of what happened.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no discrepancies about the essential facts in this case,&quot; they said. &quot;A few witnesses disagreed about inconsequential details. That does not in our judgment constitute making false statements to Congress.&quot;</p>
