<p>Middle East dirty tanker rates edged down in quiet Monday trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) from the Middle East were generally fixed about 2.5 Worldscale points lower than on Friday, with voyages west at about W50, to Japan at W60/61 and to Singapore at W50 for older vessels and W60 for modern ships, one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are quite a few ships out there and a lack of steady enquiry,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Most other sectors were quiet.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean 80,000 tonne sector, which soared in mid-January, continued to soften to around W135 in thin trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There are cargoes to be fixed but it's not an easy market right now and it's hard to get a firm idea of rates,&quot; an Italian broker said. He said the rate for 130,000 tonne cross-Med vessels remained about W95.</p>
<p>Brokers said North Sea-U.S. Gulf cargoes were assessed slightly lower at W60 for VLCCs and W90 for 130,000 tonners -- about 2.5 points down in both cases -- but few fixtures were seen.</p>
<p>West Africa/USG VLCCs were steady at W62.5, while 130,000 tonne vessels were hard to pin down in a thin market, although brokers said one had been fixed at W90 late on Friday against W95 previously.</p>
<p>The inter-U.K./Cont market was extremely quiet with 80,000 tonners still notionally at about W110.</p>
<p>The market for fuel oil cargoes was active with a firm tone, brokers said. Inter-U.K./Cont 25,000 tonners were steady at W205 and cross-Med at W190.  </p>
<p>In the U.S. sector, rates were steady with 70,000 tonnes Caribs/upcoast at W155 and 50,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes at W165/170. &quot;Rates really haven't changed much since Wednesday,&quot; one broker noted.</p>
