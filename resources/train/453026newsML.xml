<p>King Hussein dismissed Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti on Wednesday and replaced him with a veteran former premier who signed Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.</p>
<p>The king picked 71-year-old Abdul-Salam al-Majali to form a new government, instructing him to streamline bureaucracy and prepare for November elections.</p>
<p>He said Majali should make Jordan's commitment to the Middle East peace process and support for Palestinian statehood his foreign policy priority.</p>
<p>Majali, an elder tribal leader who as prime minister in 1993 oversaw Jordan's first multi-party elections in decades, chose a cabinet of 23 mainly technocrat ministers, retaining just a handful of Kabariti's 31 ministers.</p>
<p>Accepting Kabariti's letter of resignation, King Hussein accused him of cultivating a flamboyant media image at the expense of state matters.</p>
<p>&quot;You chose...to emphasise the prime minister's media image in every problem and issue,&quot; the king said. &quot;My excuse for you was that you were exhausted to the point of leaving the essential matters for which I had chosen you to tackle in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>There were no personal thanks in the king's long letter to Kabariti for his 13-month premiership.</p>
<p>His supporters say Kabariti, 47, was a bold decision maker whose reformist &quot;white revolution&quot; met resistance from entrenched interests and rival politicians.</p>
<p>Businessmen and economists expressed disappointment at his dismissal, saying Majali was unlikely to focus as strongly on economic reforms.</p>
<p>Kabariti tabled legislation to reform the stock exchange, customs and company laws. His International Monetary Fund-backed cuts in bread subsidies in August led to riots and calls for his resignation.</p>
<p>His domestic record was mixed with difficult relations with parliament, especially with the Islamic opposition.</p>
<p>But his dismissal on Wednesday came as a surprise to many.</p>
<p>The king said a visit to an orphanage three weeks ago with Kabariti had opened his eyes to what he said was the prime minister's lack of concern for society's most vulnerable members.</p>
<p>The visit prompted him to &quot;question whether (Kabariti) was the same youthful man whom I had chosen to head the government over others,&quot; the king said.</p>
<p>Kabariti declined to give reasons for his dismissal but suggested it was connected to a recent flare-up of tensions with Israel. &quot;It is Jordan's fate always to be in the centre of events and storms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Jordanian soldier shot dead seven Israeli schoolgirls last week after Jordan warned Israel that its plans to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem could provoke violence.</p>
<p>Some observers said Kabariti was unhappy that the king met Netanyahu in Jerusalem, just a week after rebuking him for pushing the Middle East &quot;towards the abyss of bloodshed.&quot;</p>
<p>Businessmen said they hoped Majali's good relations with Israel and Iraq could help revive trade with Jordan's neighbours.</p>
<p>But one banker, mindful of King Hussein's fondness for frequent cabinet reshuffles, declined to get carried away.</p>
<p>&quot;In Jordan, we change governments like we change clothes,&quot; he said.</p>
