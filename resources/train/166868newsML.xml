<p>The European Union said on Tuesday it was sending a delegation to the Middle East from November 9-12, but EU diplomats said plans to visit Jerusalem had been shelved due to sharp differences with the Israeli government.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring will lead a &quot;troika&quot; of EU foreign ministers to the region, visiting Syria, Jordan, Gaza and Egypt, the EU said.</p>
<p>But plans to meet the Palestinians at their Orient House offices in disputed East Jerusalem have been postponed after vigorous objections from the Israeli government, diplomats said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were unable to resolve our differences with Israel but will be meeting the Israeli government to pursue dialogue,&quot; one EU diplomat who will be on the visit said.</p>
<p>Rather than visit Jerusalem, the troika will meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy at a Middle East summit in Cairo and will resume talks with his government when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Ireland this month.</p>
<p>Israel objected vehemently to the EU plan to go to Orient House in East Jerusalem, seeing it as an expression of support for Palestinian claims to Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of the visit to the Middle East is to underline the EU's continued engagement in the seach for peace in the region,&quot; EU president Ireland said in a statement on behalf of the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>The troika, comprising Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands, is due to arrive in Syria on November 9.</p>
<p>On November 10 the ministers will meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad before travelling to Jordan to meet King Hussein and then Gaza for talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>On November 11 they travel to Cairo to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and the following day they meet Israel's Levy on the margins of the Middle East Conference, the EU said.</p>
<p>The EU, the biggest donor of aid to the region and a major trading partner, feels it has been sidelined by the United States in efforts to get 1993 Middle East peace accords back on track, diplomats said.</p>
<p>It has been sharply critical of Israel's failure to pull its forces out of the West Bank town of Hebron, as stipulated in the agreements, and of the closure of Palestinian towns because of a recent surge of anti-Israeli violence.</p>
<p>Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat visited Dublin last month to secure diplomatic support from the EU for his campaign to get the agreements carried out in full.</p>
<p>He was rewarded by backing from the EU and a statement by Irish Prime Minister John Bruton critical of the poor living standards endured by Palestinians because of the Israeli closures policy.</p>
<p>The EU said the troika is due to visit Russia before the Middle East trip, arriving in Moscow on November 8 for talks with Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin before flying to Damascus.</p>
