<p>Smuggling and other unofficial imports of sugar have caused heavy losses to the sugar industry in northeastern Heilongjiang province, China's biggest beet-producing region, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The sugar sector in our province has suffered 1.9 billion yuan in losses since 1992,&quot; said Yu Honglu, general manager of the Heilongjiang Sugar Industry Group, adding that about 63 percent of sugar mills in China were running at a loss.</p>
<p>Mills in Heilongjiang, which has annual sugar production capacity of 760,000 tonnes, now had 4.5 billion yuan ($540 million) in debts, Yu said from the provincial capital Harbin.</p>
<p>Loss-making sugar mills owed more than 400 million yuan in back pay to workers and payments for beet, and this had had a serious impact on interest among farmers in planting beet, the Economic Information Daily said.</p>
<p>So far this year, beet had been planted on about 240,000 hectares, equivalent to just half of total processing capacity, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Yu blamed the problems on huge sugar smuggling that had forced domestic retail prices to fall to 4,000 yuan per tonne now from 5,500 yuan per tonne in the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;One tonne of smuggled sugar can make about 1,000 yuan in profit,&quot; he said, adding that sales from bonded warehouses was another source of cheap sugar that had evaded tax.</p>
<p>For example, one company in southwestern Guangxi region was recently fined 100 million yuan for smuggling 320,000 tonnes of sugar onto the domestic market, Yu said.</p>
<p>The government should take tougher action to crack down on smuggling to protect domestic mills, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the current situation, the domestic sugar industry is unlikely to rebound in the next few years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Officials have said among 2.0 million tonnes of sugar were illegally imported in 1995.</p>
<p>China produced 6.604 million tonnes of sugar in the 1996/97 crushing season (October/April)</p>
