<p>The Slovak government on Tuesday approved a recovery programme for troubled state-owned white goods producer Calex a.s. under which it plans to sell up to 51 percent to a foreign strategic partner, a senior Economics Ministry official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the plan, we will form a new firm, in which domestic subjects will hold 49 percent and the state will keep the remaining 51 percent stake, which will be later offered to a (foreign) strategic partner,&quot; Jozef Brhel, Deputy Economics Minister, told journalists after a regular government session.</p>
<p>Brhel said Slovak export-import company Omnia would take 25 percent in Calex, while the largest commercial bank VUB would hold 24 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already held preliminary talks with several major home appliance producers, including Electrolux, Merloni or Zanussi, and we expect to start serious negotiations about the entry of a foreign partner into Calex in coming months,&quot; Brhel said, adding that Calex was now &quot;on the verge of bankruptcy&quot;.</p>
<p>He added the government may sell its entire stake in Calex to a foreign partner, but that the size of the stake would depend on who will be the foreign partner.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the bids and our choice (of investor), we will decide on the size of the stake on the offer,&quot; Brhel said, adding that price was still not determined.</p>
<p>The ministry estimates Calex's book value at some six billion crowns.</p>
<p>Brhel said the government had also reached an agreement with South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to purchase Samsung's stake in the joint venture with Calex for $9 million, which will go to the state budget.</p>
<p>In 1991 Calex and Samsung created a joint venture, Calex s.r.o., to make refrigerators and freezers with the South Korean firm holding 44.8 percent.</p>
<p>He said Samsung had waived its priority right, under the 1991 deal, to buy the whole of Calex making it necessary for the state to buy out the Samsung stake in the joint venture.</p>
<p>The state has extended guarantees for billions of crowns in credits to modernise Calex over the past six years, but Brhel said &quot;the money was not used in a proper way&quot;, adding the guarantees had cost the government some 2.5 billion crowns ($75.76 million).&quot;</p>
