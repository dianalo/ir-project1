<p>Expectations of a resolution in the German gold row sent implied volatility of Bund options on LIFFE falling in the front month on Tuesday, traders in London said.</p>
<p>A source close to the ruling German coalition said Chancellor Helmut Kohl had backed down on the controversial plan to revalue the Bundesbank's currency and gold reserves. Finance minister Theo Waigel and Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said they were on their way to a deal.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility fell off, particularly in the front month on the gold news,&quot; said a broker at a British brokerage in London. &quot;Back months aren't being hit so hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Implied volatility of July serial options fell to 5.77 percent, from 6.14 percent on Monday. September fell to 5.7 percent from 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>July options on the September Bund futures expire on June 23. September Bund futures were up 0.59 at 100.32 by 1430 GMT.</p>
<p>Last week, Bund volatility shot over the key 6.00 percent level, as the Bundesbank insisted that the process of revaluation should not take place until 1999, or until after the decision over which countries will be part of European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has some 95 million ounces of gold in its reserves, valued at 13.7 billion marks, compared with a current market value of more than 55 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;It look like EMU's back on track,&quot; said the broker.</p>
<p>A broker at a French bank said key features of the day's trading were aggressive selling of the 101.00 July calls. According to LIFFE data, more than 7,700 contracts were traded at that strike.</p>
<p>Out-of-the-money puts were an attractive buy, at the 98.00 through 99.50 strikes, traders said. About 8,700 lots were traded at the 99.50 strike, and more than 5,100 at 98.00.</p>
<p>The French bank broker said the key non-farm U.S. payroll report, scheduled for release on Friday, had prevented further slides in volatility. -- Lisa Wilson, International Bonds Unit + 44 171 542 6137</p>
