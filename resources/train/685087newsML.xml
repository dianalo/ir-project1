<p>The National Hockey League's board of governor's Wednesday awarded new franchises to groups in Atlanta, Nashville, St. Paul and Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>The awarding of franchises will help spur the construction of new partly bond-financed arenas in Atlanta, St. Paul and Columbus and the issuance of additional debt for improvements at an arena in Nashville.</p>
<p>The Tennessee franchise will begin play in 1998, Georgia in 1999, the Minnesota team based in St. Paul in 2000 and Ohio in 2000, the league announced.  </p>
<p>The board of governors also approved the relocation of the former Hartford Whalers franchise to North Carolina for the 1997-98 season. It has been renamed the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
<p>The expansion will boost NHL membership to 30 teams by the end of the cycle. Each ownership group must pay an $80 million franchise fee.</p>
<p>A $213 million Atlanta arena would rely in part on $140 million of revenue bonds.</p>
<p>St. Paul has committed to $30 million of bonds for a new $130 million arena and pledged to issue another $65 million of debt if Minnesota lawmakers choose not to include it in a capital spending bill next year.  </p>
<p>Columbus has approved private financing for a $125 million arena that would include more than $20 million of infrastructure improvements paid by the city and Franklin County.</p>
<p>The Nashville franchise will be majority-owned by Leipold Hockey Holdings LLC, jointly held by Craig Leipold and the S.C. Johnson family.</p>
<p>Turner Broadcasting System Inc, owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team, will own the Atlanta hockey franchise.</p>
<p>The Columbus team is expected to be owned by a group led by Worthington Industries Chairman John McConnell.</p>
<p>The St. Paul franchise will be held by a limited partnership led by billboard magnate Robert Naegele Jr.</p>
<p>The expansion committee recommended the four cities last week. It had also considered bids from Houston and Oklahoma City groups.</p>
<p>Each franchise must sell 12,000 season tickets by four months before the start of their first season, Commissioner Gary Bettman noted.</p>
