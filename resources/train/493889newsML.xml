<headline>Dlr ends up in US after brush with new high on yen.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>*Dlr closes marginally higher. Dlr/yen rally peters out after jump to new 56-month peak at 126.52, heavy after wire report citing administration source saying Washington concerned weak yen will result in Japan economic reform delay, but 126 props.</p>
<p>*Sakakibara and rumored BOJ rate check in Tokyo encouraged profit taking. Dlr/mark floor seen 1.7050, offers 1.7160/80.</p>
<p>The dollar closed slightly firmer after pausing to catch its breath in the U.S. following an earlier sprint to a 56-month high against the yen.</p>
<p>The dollar hit 126.52 yen in Europe, its highest since August 1992, after a news report that Tsutomu Makino, Japan's Vice Trade Minister, said the weak yen was more positive than negative for the country's economy at the moment.</p>
<p>But the rally petered out in U.S. trade and investors took profits amid concerns that the dollar's rapid advance in recent days might prompt the Bank of Japan to sell dollars in the open market to slow the currency's advance, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course (Makino) affected the forex market a little, but not so much I think,&quot; said Tadatoshi Taso, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;The speed of the uptrend of the dollar is a little bit too rapid, so it's a correction of the movement,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 126.28/33 yen, up modestly from 126.20/30 yen at the open. It finished at 1.7147/52 marks, up from 1.7135/45.</p>
<p>An earlier comment by Eisuke Sakakibara, the director- general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, introduced a note of caution into the market.</p>
<p>Sakakibara said Japanese authorities would be ready to intervene in the foreign exchange markets if rates veered sharply from economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>The dollar was also briefly weighed down after a wire service report, quoting a source close to the Clinton Administration, suggested Washington is worried that Japan will rely on the weak yen to stimulate an export-led recovery and could delay economic reforms needed to boost the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;That is sort of what I think hit the market late,&quot; said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw dollar/yen go down (to about 125.90) ... and the people kind of said: 'Who is this?' and blew it off,&quot; said Gilmore, referring to the market's reaction.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar garnered support against other key currencies from comments by Michel Camdessus, the head of the International Monetary Fund, who said the dollar was in a credible zone against European currencies and the yen.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark also benefitted after comments from German finance officials appeared to hint that European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would start on time.</p>
<p>Bundesbank council member Guntram Palm said chances for a timely start to the single currency were better than ever after last weekend's European Union finance ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that stubbornly high German unemployment would not have a direct impact on the timetable for entry to EMU.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar closed at 1.4730/40 Swiss francs, down from 1.4745/55 francs at the open. Sterling climbed to $1.6255/65 from $1.6197/07. The dollar finished at Canadian $1.3882/87, up from C$1.3863/68.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar rose to $0.7812/17 from $0.7786/91.</p>
