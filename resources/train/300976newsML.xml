<p>Rising British tennis star Tim Henman and Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis completed dream countdowns to the Australian Open on Saturday by winning the men's and women's finals at the Sydney International.</p>
<p>Henman, 22, claimed his first professional title by beating Spain's Carlos Moya 6-3 6-1 less than a week after playing in his first career final in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>Hingis, in her third tour win, stopped former American child star Jennifer Capriati 6-1 7-5 6-1, reclaiming the last title she won before her three-year absence from the game,</p>
<p>In his second final in six days, Henman started as favourite against baseliner Moya, a 20-year-old who is one of 14 Spaniards in the top 100 ranked men.</p>
<p>Moya made a strong start, breaking Henman in the third game of the first set with powerful and precise groundstrokes.</p>
<p>Henman broke back decisively and dominated the match from then on, taking 11 of 13 games to wrap up within 54 minutes. Constantly varying his pace and length, he closed Moya down with well-placed volleys from the net and some acute passing shots.</p>
<p>He broke the Spaniard's service three times in the second set, including winning the seventh and final game to love.</p>
<p>The win will place Henman 14th or 15th in the rankings, making him the first Briton to crack the top 20 since Buster Mottram in 1983.</p>
<p>It also means that his three stated ambitions for 1997 -- to make the top 20, to win a tournament and to become a regular finalist -- have already been met two weeks into the year. He said his substitute target would be a place in the top 10.</p>
<p>He is the first British male to win at the Sydney tournament since Vaughan Wilberforce Eaves in 1902 -- and he was born in Australia.</p>
<p>Henman has a first-round date with Australian giant Mark Philippoussis, one of the biggest hitters in the sport.</p>
<p>The women's final was a match full of resonances. Capriati, now on the comeback trail, became the youngest women's champion in Sydney in 1993 at the age of 16 years and nine months,</p>
<p>She lost that record to Hingis, aged 16 years and three months but with two full years of tour tennis behind her.</p>
<p>It was the first time Capriati had faced the player who took her place as the sport's youngest major star and has eclipsed many of her age records.</p>
<p>Apart from a spell in the second set, however, when Capriati played some beautifully-controlled shots to come back from 1-4 down to win 7-5, Hingis was dominant.</p>
<p>&quot;Four years ago she was the title-holder and now she's struggling and I'm in the same place -- it's weird,&quot; said Hingis, adding that Capriati had nevertheless played &quot;a great match&quot; against her.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm younger than Jennifer but right now I think I'm more experienced,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Hingis is seeded fourth in the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, but is seen by many as the woman with the best chance to beat world number one Steffi Graf of Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm still 16, I have nothing to lose,&quot; she said.</p>
