<p>The following is a full text of a speech by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane to the 25th Conference of Economists in Canberra on Wednesday.</p>
<p>MAKING MONETARY POLICY: PERCEPTIONS AND REALITY</p>
<p>I would like to start by congratulating the Economic Society for putting together this policy forum.  They certainly have been even-handed - one Central Bank Governor and one Secretary to the Treasury as speakers, a chairman who is a Secretary to the Treasury and a discussant who has been both a Central Bank Governor and a Secretary to the Treasury.  </p>

<p>The index of independence is based on the arrangements that existed before the reforms that took place in 1989 in New Zealand and 1994 in France.</p>
<p>Of course, it should also be recognised that all these measures are just attempts to simplify a very complex structure into one number or ranking. They are all imperfect, which is shown by the fact that they are all different. They take no account of personalities or of other policies which may impact on monetary policy. Even so, if they are going to be quoted - and they frequently are - it is better for us if the most No text received</p>
