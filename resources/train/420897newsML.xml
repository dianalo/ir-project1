<p>Chile has refused to pardon ex-brigadier Pedro Espinoza who is serving a six-year jail sentence for the 1976 murder of diplomat Orlando Letelier in Washington, Espinoza's lawyer said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It was the second time President Eduardo Frei's government has turned down a pardon plea from Espinoza, once the second-ranking officer in the now-disbanded DINA secret police.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision reflects the feeling of the whole country,&quot; said Socialist deputy Juan Pablo Letelier, son of the murdered diplomat.</p>
<p>Espinoza and his chief in the DINA, retired general Manuel Contreras, were convicted in 1995 of ordering the car bomb assassination of Letelier, foreign minister in the government of Marxist President Salvador Allende. Letelier's young American assistant Ronni Moffitt also died in the attack.</p>
<p>Contreras' lawyer asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to reduce the former general's sentence by one year, arguing that both men should receive the same prison term for the crime.</p>
<p>Letelier opposed the idea. &quot;It is not fitting to grant pardons...or a reduced sentence to those who have caused so much damage to our country.&quot;</p>
<p>Espinoza and Contreras are being held near Santiago in the top-security Punta Peuco jail, built to house military officers convicted of human rights abuses during the rule of dictator General Augusto Pinochet, now the army commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>The DINA, the most feared of Pinochet's security services, were responsible for wiping out left-wing opponents of the regime. A government commission has found that nearly 3,200 people died or disappeared without trace during the military government which ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990.</p>
