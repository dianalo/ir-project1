<p>Taiwan share prices closed sharply lower on Monday, as investors heeding a central bank warning about the market's sizzling rally locked in profits in the heavily weighted financial sector, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended down 103.26 points or 1.29 percent at 7,880.45 points, just above its morning low of 7,879.86.</p>
<p>Turnover was a hectic T$105.079 billion.</p>
<p>The most heavily weighted financials plunged 3.16 percent, with Huan Nan Bank down T$9 to close at T$145, and Cathay Life Insurance falling T$7 to T$180.  </p>
<p>The cement and construction sectors dropped 1.15 percent and 1.05 percent, respectively, with Southeast Cement sliding T$1.20 at T$30.40.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank's warning on Saturday was the main reason pulling down the closely watched financial issues, which often react swiftly to any comments by the central bank,&quot; said Jardine Fleming fund manager George Hou. Hou said the central bank hopes market turnover will not become too large.</p>
<p>Central bank deputy governor Hsu Chia-tung said on Saturday that individual investors should exercise caution in a big rally that added more than 1,000 points in January and February.  </p>
<p>Other stock analysts said share prices would remain on a correction basis in the near term because of Hsu's comment.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected a bearish trend as long as the discouraging news from the central bank lingers.</p>
<p>For Tuesday, a 7,500-7,900 trading range was seen.</p>
