<p>Thousands of demonstrators rampaged through the Albanian port of Vlore on Monday, hurling stones and furniture at riot police and chasing them from the city centre.</p>
<p>There was no official word on casualties, but a nurse said Vlore hospital had treated at least 50 people, both protesters and police, mostly hit by flying stones.</p>
<p>The rioting engulfed streets around Independence Square where tens of thousands protesters denouncing President Sali Berisha and the collapse of pyramid investment schemes had marched peacefully for five consecutive days.</p>
<p>Elderly men and women picked up paving stones and handed them to demonstrators who threw them at police forced to retreat up a hill and out of sight. Shots rang out periodically.</p>
<p>One person died in an initial clash on Sunday evening, when protesters threw stones at a police station and officers responded by firing into the air.</p>
<p>The hospital nurse said doctors were overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&quot;I have counted myself more than 50 injured from both sides. People have been hit by stones,&quot; she said. &quot;More are coming all the time. It's a terrible situation. Doctors have no time even to talk.&quot;</p>
<p>Some police were given shelter in houses, others were cornered by buildings and stripped of their uniforms down to their underpants. Several people were carried from the city centre, blood streaming from their faces.</p>
<p>Rioters burned police uniforms along with captured riot shields to loud cheers. Two bonfires burned in the city centre.</p>
<p>&quot;Vlore has shown that the people are sovereign, that democracy will live,&quot; cried one man in his 60s. &quot;The people of Vlore will guarantee it.</p>
<p>A government statement clearly drafted before Monday's confrontations blamed the unrest on &quot;left-wing extremist groups&quot;, urged residents to distance themselves from the protests and said police would take firm action.</p>
<p>&quot;These groups are the main organisers of the protests in the city&quot;. It denounced Sunday's &quot;sudden and groundless attack on Vlore police station.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials said the victim in Sunday's clash, the first in a month of unrest over the pyramid investment schemes, died of a heart attack. Demonstrators blamed police.</p>
<p>Protesters accuse Berisha and his government of failing to warn them about the pyramid investment schemes which have collapsed with the life savings of hundreds of thousands of people in the former Communist country.</p>
