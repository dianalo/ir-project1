<title>USA: US lawmakers, TV execs to meet on TV ratings.</title>
<headline>US lawmakers, TV execs to meet on TV ratings.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>An influential senator critical of the television industry's new system for rating programs said Friday that lawmakers plan to meet soon with TV and Hollywood executives to discuss possible changes.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that we are now in a period of negotiation,&quot; said Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee.</p>
<p>McCain told reporters after a speech to the United States Telephone Association that lawmakers and industry executives plan to sit down together soon. McCain said he wants parents groups involved in any talks.  </p>
<p>He said the executives -- Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture Association of America and Eddie Fritts of the National Association of Broadcasters -- are striving to achieve a consensus on the ratings within the industry.</p>
<p>McCain said it is too early to know the final outcome.</p>
<p>The age-based ratings drew fire at a Commerce Committee hearing last week from lawmakers who said the current system does not go far enough.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties contended that the industry should adopt a content-based system that spells out the level of sex, violence and strong language in a program -- a view supported by children's advocates, parents groups and others.</p>
<p>At the hearing, both Valenti and Fritts expressed a willingness to make changes in the system.</p>
<p>McCain said it was &quot;foolish&quot; for the industry to have adopted its aged-based system -- such as TV-14 for parents of kids under 14 strongly cautioned -- without having properly consulted with children's and parents groups first.</p>
