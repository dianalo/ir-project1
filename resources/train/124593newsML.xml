<p>Venezuela said on Thursday it had no plans to issue any fresh bonds for the rest of this year although it was studying the leads set by Mexico and the Philippines in extending their debt yield curves.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't plan to issue any more bonds in 1996, and the reason is that the income from oil has generated enough to finance the deficit we have in the budget,&quot; Venezuelan Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar told reporters after addressing a meeting of London financiers at the Bank of England.</p>
<p>But he said Venezuela had been meeting investment banks and examining its financial strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;We are taking advantage of this short-term opportunity to review our global strategy on public finance,&quot; Matos said.</p>
<p>&quot;What we want now is a long-term type of structure -- we are analysing Mexico's placing of bonds in a 30-year long-term period, we're analysing the Philippines' case, and we're getting a lot of proposals for that new (long term) approach.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico stunned the financial markets in May when it pulled off the successful launch of a $1.75 billion global bond with a 30-year maturity, extending its yield curve dramatically less than 18 months after its shock peso devaluation.</p>
<p>In September the Philippines followed suit, issuing nearly $700 million in 20-year Eurobonds. Both countries used the proceeds to retire some of their outstanding Brady debt.</p>
<p>Matos said Venezuela had a very high medium-term debt profile, with some $3.0 billion in external debt maturing on average between now 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We do plan to have a policy of changing the profile of the servicing of the debt,&quot; he said. But he denied Venezuela was studying the possibility of buying back some of its Brady debt.</p>
<p>He said the proceeds from its recent mark-denominated Eurobond issue, and windfall proceeds from higher oil prices, would be used to pay off some of its outstanding obligations.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to use the results from the bonds we placed in Germany to pay all the old arrears we have had from 1993, 1994, up to 1996,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That means from 1997 we will be up to date with all our payments.&quot;</p>
<p>However Matos also said Venezuela planned to &quot;stay in touch with the market&quot;, though he declined to elaborate on what form this might take. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734</p>
