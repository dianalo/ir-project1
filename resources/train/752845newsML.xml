<p>Further loan defaults by Thai companies will savage sentiment as the country struggles to shore up its battered economy, and could ultimately force it to seek external financial assistance, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is any loan default it would hurt market sentiment badly, especially if these companies are listed,&quot; said Merrill Lynch economist Irene Cheung.</p>
<p>There have been two major defaults so far.</p>
<p>Somprasong Land failed to make a US$3.1 million interest payment on an US$80 million Euro-convertible in February.</p>
<p>Alphatec Electronics also defaulted on the put payment on its US$43.7 million convertible bond that fell due on June 21. Bondholders of Alphatec, Thailand's largest assembler of semiconductors, are meeting in Zurich from August 4 to 8.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are more of these companies -- every time when there is something of this nature -- the market will take it very seriously,&quot; Cheung said.</p>
<p>Speculators concerned about Thailand's high foreign liabilities, wide current account deficit and bloated financial sector forced a de facto devaluation of the Thai baht on July 2. The baht has now depreciated by more than 20 percent, heightening concern about loan defaults, business failures and mass layoffs.</p>
<p>A full-blown recession is now considered possible.</p>
<p>Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya said this week Thailand's total foreign-denominated debt stock amounted to US$89.8 billion, of which US$73 billion was in the form of commercial credits.</p>
<p>Of that US$73 billion, more than 45 percent consists of short-term commercial debt issued under the Bangkok International Banking Facility.</p>
<p>Because the individual amounts involved in BIBF are small, failure to meet interest payments or default on principle might not cause too much disruption, Cheung said.</p>
<p>Of much greater concern is the remaining US$38 billion in commercial credits. Any default on this debt would cause a substantial sentiment shift, and could be the trigger that persuades Thailand to seek external assistance with its financial crisis, sources said.</p>
<p>Some analysts have speculated that Thailand's inability so far to come up with a coherent economic package could partly explain its reluctance to seek financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Thanong said on Thursday that he would announce a major economic package within two weeks.</p>
<p>He has previously rejected any suggestion that Thailand will seek external assistance, and Thailand has yet to make an official request to the IMF.</p>
<p>But analysts believe the scale of problems in Thailand's financial sector, which is weighed under by bad loans, will soon make IMF involvement hard to avoid.</p>
<p>Japan, which is believed to hold a large amount of Thai debt, has declined to assist Bangkok unless the IMF is involved. Japan has also stipulated that its financial assistance cannot be used to bail out Thai financial institutions.</p>
<p>Thailand has issued only US$17 billion in sovereign debt, the vast majority of which is long-term.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch chief economist Nicholas Kwan said the market seems to be taking a relaxed view on sovereign issues with spreads widening only slightly after the July 2 baht flotation.</p>
