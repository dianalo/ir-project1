<headline>Pakistan police clash with Christian protesters.</headline>
<dateline>KARACHI, Pakistan 1997-02-13</dateline>

<p>Pakistani police fired teargas and detained about 200 Christians in Karachi on Thursday to break up a protest against last week's attacks by Moslem rioters in Punjab province, witnesses and police said.</p>
<p>The witnesses said police also fired shots in the air and used batons when about 4,000 Christian protesters tried to march to the official home of the governor of Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital.</p>
<p>Ambulance workers said they took a young man with a bullet wound to hospital while dozens of other people, including children, were injured by police batons.</p>
<p>&quot;They were looking for trouble,&quot; a police official said. &quot;The miscreants armed with sticks attacked the police and smashed the windscreens of dozens of vehicles,&quot; South District Senior Superintendent of Police Manzoor Moghal said.</p>
<p>Police said the demonstrators broke up into small groups and fought with the police in Karachi's main South District.</p>
<p>A Christian protester, Naveed Kausar, who had a head injury, told Reuters the police manhandled peaceful demonstrators.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,000 Christian families are living in tents after being driven from their homes by Moslem rioters in Punjab, a bishop said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, thousands of Moslems attacked the Christian- populated village of Shantinagar in southern Punjab, accusing some Christians of committing blasphemy against Islam, a charge denied by the Christians.</p>
<p>Many houses and six churches were set on fire.</p>
<p>Most of Pakistan's 131 million people are Moslems, but there is a small Christian minority, some of whose members have been accused by radical Moslem clerics of blasphemy in recent years.</p>
<p>In February 1995 two Christians, one of them a 14-year-old boy, were sentenced to death for blasphemy in Lahore, but were acquitted on appeal. They later emigrated to Germany.</p>
<p>Then-prime minister Benazir Bhutto vowed at the time to alter the blasphemy law to make it less open to abuse, but pressure from religious parties blocked any change.</p>
