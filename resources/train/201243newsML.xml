<p>The stage is set for a flurry of activity to bring China into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and accession is now possible within the coming year, WTO Deputy Director General Jesus Seade said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything seems to be in place now for a burst of action. Hopefully, accession could, I think, technically be possible in the course of the coming year,&quot; Seade told the 1996 Europe/East Asia Economic Summit organised by the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>Seade said recent attempts by European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan to ease China's entry into the trade body could yield results quickly if outstanding issues are resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;News brought yesterday in Sir Leon's speech was very, very encouraging... It can always go through very, very quickly,&quot; Seade told reporters.</p>
<p>Brittan said on Monday he had approached U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher with a European proposal that China join the WTO but stagger completion of its entry obligations, an approach he said Beijing had pledged to support.</p>
<p>China hoped to join the WTO at its foundation in 1995, but the United States and other developed countries insisted that economic reforms and greater market access were necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Christopher was arriving in Beijing on Tuesday to lay the groundwork for a meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton following this month's U.S. election, which both Brittan and Seade said helped trigger renewed discussion of China's WTO status.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was in China earlier in the year, it was the United States that was thought to be an obstacle in the form of having a kind of political veto,&quot; Brittan told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They thought that was sufficiently (awkward) not to want to put the matter to the test until after the presidential election. So if we can help (in) sorting things out, I regard that as a very important and worthwhile thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Seade said he had not spoken to the Americans since the approach was made, and that China's entry was not on the agenda at the WTO ministerial meeting next month in Singapore.</p>
<p>However, while in Singapore, Brittan intends to organise a &quot;Quad&quot; meeting of the WTO's four largest trading partners -- Japan, the European Union, the United States and Canada -- to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be tremendously interesting to watch,&quot; Seade said.</p>
<p>Tough negotiations on whether China should join as a developing nation with additional requirements, or as a developed nation under lenient conditions, can now be expected, Seade added.</p>
<p>&quot;What is needed is engagement and good faith and determination to go forward,&quot; Seade said.</p>
