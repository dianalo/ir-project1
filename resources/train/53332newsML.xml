<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended modestly higher in light turnover Friday, buoyed by mixed trade and speculative buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>But floor sources said commission house selling rebuffed the benchmark December contract's attempt to get through key resistance at $1,373 a tonne.</p>
<p>December settled at $1,368 a tonne, up $5 on the day, after ranging from $1,373 to $1,361. Spot September finished $11 higher at $1,353, while the remaining months ended unchanged to $7 firmer.</p>
<p>Traders also noted that strength in the London cocoa market Friday helped to lift New York.</p>
<p>&quot;The London price action was supportive throughout the session,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>On the charts, traders pegged the next level of December resistance at last Friday's intraday high of $1,379, while support was seen near $1,350.</p>
<p>Volume was paltry, at an estimated 3,338 lots.</p>
<p>Participation in the market was consistently light this week as traders digested a slew of wide-ranging world supply forecasts. While industry sources agree there is likely to be a world cocoa deficit in the 1996/97 season, predictions have varied greatly.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Landell Mills estimated a 1996/97 world cocoa supply deficit of 150,000 tonnes, while figures released Monday by the International Cocoa Organization pointed to a much larger deficit of 225,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Although UK commodity traders ED&amp;F Man did not put out data for the 1996/97 crop, Man forecast in their September report Thursday a world supply surplus in the current 1995/96 season of 36,000 tonnes, up from its May projection of a 2,000-tonne surplus.</p>
<p>Man also reported that grindings in the five largest processing nations rose over 12 percent in the second quarter of 1996, and estimated that grindings will increase by six percent this season, the highest growth rate since 1988/89.</p>
<p>Since last Friday, the December position shed just $5.</p>
<p>Traders await the CFTC Commitment of Traders report due after the close of business Friday. One traders said he suspected speculators may have gotton a bit short.</p>
