<p>Floating-rate trust preferred stock is the latest hot product in the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market, according to market sources who expect a pickup in issuance of these securities this week.</p>
<p>NationsBank Corp is expected to hit the market on Tuesday with a global offering of $500 million of floating-rate &quot;capital securities,&quot; the bank's proprietary name for trust preferred stock. NationsBanc Capital Markets and Lehman Brothers Inc will jointly manage the offering .</p>
<p>Market players note most trust preferred stock has been issued with fixed-rate coupons to date.  </p>
<p>Issuing floating rate securities allows issuers to tap a different investor base which is not as saturated with trust preferred stock, syndicate sources say.</p>
<p>And banks, who are expected to issue much of the product, favor floating rate borrowing as many of their assets are floating rate as well.</p>
<p>Market sources say the NationsBank securities will have coupons indexed to three-month Libor. They will have 30-year maturities, which will not be callable for 10 years.</p>
<p>Trust preferred securities are treated as bonds by most investors and rating agencies.  </p>
<p>Price talk on the NationsBank deal was unavailable.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns &amp; Co Inc is also expected to issue $150 million in 30-year trust preferred securities which will have a hybrid fixed/floating rate structure sometime this week.</p>
<p>Analysts say banks and other financial institutions are likely to resume issuing trust preferred securities in force after a brief hiatus.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks are typically blacked out from issuing during their earnings reporting period. Now that most have reported for the fourth quarter, expect them to come back to the market,&quot; a bond syndicate source said.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the trust preferred primary market, Arvin Industries Inc is expected to issue a $100 million 30-year trust preferred deal via Merrill Lynch &amp; Co later this week.</p>
<p>In the junk bond primary market, the pace of new issuance is expected to kick into overdrive with at least six new deals scheduled to price this week, syndicate sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Flows into high-yield funds were over $350 million (last week), continuing to fuel a healthy high-yield market,&quot; stated Frank Benevento, head of junk bond capital markets at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Corp.  </p>
<p>New high-yield issues expected to price this week include:</p>
<p>-Multicanal S.A.'s 144a offering of $125 million in notes due 2002 and $125 million in notes due 2007 via Credit Suisse First Boston</p>
<p>-Orion Network Systems' $100 million zero coupon bond deal via Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc.</p>
<p>-Petro Stopping Centers' 144a offering of $125 million in senior notes due 2007 via CIBC Woody Gundy.</p>
<p>-Electronic Retailing Systems International's 144a offering of $100 million  of senior discount notes due 2004 via Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>Also on the plate for this week are two PIK preferred stock deals, exchangeable for junk bonds. They are:</p>
<p>-Nextlink Communications' $125 million senior redeemable exchangeable PIK preferred stock 144a offering via Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>-Pegasus Communications Corp's $100 million cumulative exchangeable preferred stock 144a offering via CIBC Wood Gundy.</p>
