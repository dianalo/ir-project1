<p>A bomb exploded on a bus in northern India on Sunday, killing one person and injuring eight others, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.</p>
<p>The news agency said the explosion took place in Pathankot town, about 200 km (120 miles) north of the capital of Punjab state, Chandigarh, near the state's northern border with Jammu and Kashmir state.</p>
<p>The Jammu and Kashmir public transport bus was at a bridge in Pathankot when the device went off at about 10:20 a.m. (0450 GMT), PTI said.</p>
<p>It was the second bomb blast in Punjab this year, the news agency said. Seven people were killed on March 14 when a bomb went off outside a railway station in Jalandhar town.</p>
<p>Thousands of people were killed during a decade-long Sikh separatist movement that peaked in June 1984 when the army attacked Sikhdom's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple, to flush out militants holed up there.</p>
<p>Four months later then prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards and India's capital was rocked by anti-Sikh rioting.</p>
<p>A Sikh party took power in Punjab after mostly peaceful state elections in February.</p>
