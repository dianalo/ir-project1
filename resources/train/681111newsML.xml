<p>Turkish prime minister-designate Mesut Yilmaz vowed on Monday not to dash secularist hopes that he can form a secularist coalition and keep the Islamists out of power.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible for a compromise government that excludes the (Islamist) Welfare Party not to win a vote of confidence,&quot; Yilmaz told a news conference. &quot;There is a general consensus on that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Istanbul shares closed up a solid eight percent on expectations that free-marketeer Yilmaz could cobble together a coalition from among squabbling secularist parties.</p>
<p>But Yilmaz did not say how he would overcome his lack of parliamentary support against an Islamist-backed alliance that favours Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller as prime minister.</p>
<p>Turkey, a NATO member and a hopeful of joining the European Union, has not had a stable government since before general elections in late 1995 which the Islamists narrowly won.</p>
<p>Yilmaz repeated a call to his fellow conservatives in Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) to join him in government. &quot;I am holding my hand out again to the DYP,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Turkish press says Yilmaz is trying to woo True Path backbenchers to abandon their leader Ciller and join the planned secularist alliance.</p>
<p>The pair, bitter rivals, formed an anti-Islamist coalition last year that collapsed after only three months. Ciller then went on to join the Islamists in power.</p>
<p>President Suleyman Demirel last week nominated Yilmaz to put together a government following the resignation of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, an Islamist who quit after months of open criticism from the secularist army about religious activism.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the friction between the two main right-wing parties has helped the increase in radical movements,&quot; Yilmaz said.</p>
<p>He is to meet leaders of four political parties, including Ciller, on Tuesday for talks on setting up a new government.</p>
<p>Ciller, a U.S.-educated economist who was Turkey's first woman prime minister, has so far poured cold water on peace overtures from Yilmaz at the weekend.</p>
<p>A dissident MP from Ciller's faction who resigned on Sunday denied reports he would join Yilmaz' Motherland Party but said he would back Yilmaz in a vote of confidence.</p>
<p>&quot;I will vote for him,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted MP Haluk Muftuler as saying. He predicted that two or three other MPs were ready to quit True Path in an anti-Islamist protest.</p>
<p>Yilmaz is around a dozen votes short of the simple majority he would need to win a confidence vote in the 550-seat assembly. He has said he will have his cabinet ready by the start of next week.</p>
<p>He is opposed by a 282-member alliance of the Islamists, True Path and a small right-wing party that aims to set up a caretaker government and go for early elections.</p>
