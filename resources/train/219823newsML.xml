<headline>Croatian stocks lower, dullness to last.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1996-11-27</dateline>

<p>Croatian stocks closed mostly lower in somewhat brisker trade on Wednesday, but analysts foresaw no big developments on the market plagued by negligible demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost all stocks show a downward trend...I don't think any sudden boom could happen in the near future,&quot; a trader with a large market share said.</p>
<p>He maintained demand was largely outstripped by offers, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;People here don't hesitate to lower the prices....Also, some foreign investors fled to other growing markets,&quot; he said without elaborating further.</p>
<p>Of eight active issues, two were up, five down and two were up. Volume was higher at 1,470 shares, turnover also rose to 1.3 million kuna from Tuesday's meagre 865,305 kuna.</p>
<p>Top gainer drugs firm Pliva rebounded 400 kuna to close at 13,000, on volume of 54 shares.</p>
<p>The other gainer, Karlovacka Pivovara, inched up four kuna to 214, with 44 shares sold.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka Banka inched down five kuna to 1,000, with 141 shares changing hands. But traders said the bank was likely to resist the bearish trend, together with the other fully-listed issue, Pliva.</p>
<p>The biggest of the five decliners, hotelier Laguna, lost 100 kuna to close at 1,050, trading 39 shares.</p>
<p>The hotelier was closely followed by confectioner Kras which edged down 60 kuna to 450, but was the most actively traded issue on volume of 629 shares.</p>
<p>Food processor Podravka was also on the losing side, edging down 15 kuna to 200, selling 357 units. Hotelier Suncani Hvar slipped two kuna to 58, with 160 shares traded.</p>
<p>Only hotelier Arenaturist remained unchanged at 150 kuna, with 46 shares changing hands.</p>
