<p>The National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) has raised the reserve requirement for commercial banks to 20 percent from 15 following a sharp monetary expansion over the last several months, an NBY official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is aimed to mop up surplus liquidity of the banking sector which was created over the last few months,&quot; a central bank official who asked not to be named told Reuters.</p>
<p>Along with the increase in the reserve requirement, the NBY abandoned its previous regulation according to which funds set aside for the reserve requirement were split equally into two separate accounts.</p>
<p>Banks used only half of the reserve requirement to bridge their daily liquidity problems.</p>
<p>The other half was invested in various forms of commercial paper issued by Serbian and Montenegrin commodity reserve agencies to finance their vital economic sectors -- agriculture and tourism.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no longer restrictions on funds set aside for the reserve requirement,&quot; the NBY source said.</p>
<p>The reserve requirement was kept unchanged at 15 percent since November 1996, when the NBY raised it from 10 percent.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's key monetary aggregate has risen 17.2 percent since the beginning of 1997 to 6.52 billion dinars ($1.067 billion) at the end of June compared to 5.495 billion dinars at the end of December 1996.</p>
<p>The sharp monetary expansion coincided with Serbia's selling a part of the stake in its Telecom early in June for almost $1 billion and with a launch of a new 100-dinar note.</p>
<p>Although the NBY has repeatedly vowed to keep M1 under control and let it grow only by as much as the country's GDP rises, M1 has already exceeded by far the central bank's initial growth projections.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's gross domestic product is planned to rise 13 percent in 1997, but key indicators signal the rate will be below official forecasts. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 311 4254</p>
