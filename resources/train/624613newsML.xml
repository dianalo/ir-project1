<p>Belgian shares, steady in cautious early trade after a weaker start on Thursday, are already focusing on next week when the outcome of French elections will be known, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0825 GMT, the Bel-20 index was up 0.06 percent at 2,259.44 with 200 million francs worth of shares traded.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still waiting. It should all become clearer next week, after the elections in France. Bond markets will also have calmed down then,&quot; one said. A row between the German government and the Bundesbank over gold revaluation plans was another reason to be cautious, he said.  </p>
<p>He said the weaker start had been caused by nervousness over the Paris opening. &quot;But it opened firmer, which gave us and the Dutch a bit of courage,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A major reshuffle involving three Belgian holdings had also been digested and speculation involving banks BBL and Kredietbank and insurance company Royale Belge had nearly evaporated.</p>
<p>Wednesday's batch of dividend coupon payments was also discounted but could still weigh on the market temporarily. &quot;After the dividend period some might decrease their positions, get out,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
