<text>
<p>A judge opened a formal investigation on Friday into a Frenchman who confessed to setting off a bomb to &quot;teach his wife a lesson&quot;, justice sources said.</p>
<p>They said Thierry Derant, 34, told investigators he set off the crude remote-controlled bomb last Tuesday outside the office of Finalion, a subsidiary of state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais where his wife works, in the central French city of Lyon.</p>
<p>It was not clear why he was angry with his wife and if the unnamed woman was among the six people slightly hurt by the bomb, which was made out of a tin can packed with nails.</p>
<p>Serant was placed under investigation on suspicion of attempted murder and destruction of property with explosives.</p>
