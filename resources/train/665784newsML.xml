<p>TransTexas Gas Corp said Monday it has resumed drilling of its State Tract 331 1 well in Galveston Bay which it believes represents the discovery of its fourteenth new field.</p>
<p>The company said it anticipates reaching total projected depth on the well within the next 25 days.</p>
<p>On May 6, TransTexas was forced to suspend drilling of the well as a result of 9,600 pounds per square inch surface pressure encountered from 15,400 feet depth in the Vicksburg formation, and from which natural gas and 47 degree gravity condensate were discharged.  </p>
<p>The company said it believes the Vicksburg formation was encountered 400 feet high to the original well prognosis. Company geologists calculate that the entire Vicksburg section could be as thick as 2,000 feet and contain large intervals of gas and condensate pay. Significant hydrocarbon shows were also encountered in shallower Frio sands.</p>
<p>&quot;The shows and pressure encountered so far in the drilling of this well appear to be very promising,&quot; the company said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The 1,150 acre structure on which the State Tract 331 1 is being drilled is one of a total of four structures that we intend to drill in Galveston Bay and adjacent coastal areas over the next two months. These are tests of seismic prospects that are along trend from the nearby Chocolate Bayou or Treasure Island fields.&quot;</p>
<p>TransTexas said &quot;We've started drilling the second of these prospects, which our geologists believe has the greatest potential and is close to the State Tract 331 1, with our largest rig capable of drilling to 21,000 feet depth.&quot;</p>
<p>The company sid it has scheduled two rigs to commence drilling of two additional prospects within 30 days.</p>
<p>TransTexas said that it believes that potential reserves in these 4 prospects could exceed the proved and future reserves contained in its recent sale of the Lobo Trend properties for consideration in excess of $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company also said it is in the process of completing, or hooking up 11 wells in its other development areas that it expects to add 150 million cubic feet of gross natural gas production by the end of July.</p>
