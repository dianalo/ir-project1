<p>Trading in the Singapore rubber market was quiet by midday on Thursday with trade waiting to see if the modest buying seen from the beginning of the week will emerge again in the afternoon session, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been quiet this morning. There have been no requests for offers. Maybe the buyers will come out again this afternoon,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Michelin has perked up the rubber market here by buying several hundred tonnes of RSS3 rubber over the past few days.</p>
<p>Bridgestone was also reported to have bought some TSR20 rubber although they were not seen in the market on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Traders said holidays in Malaysia and Thailand, where they are observing the Prophet Muhammad's birthday, may keep business subdued. Easier prices in Japan, where the key December contract shed 2.4 yen to 113.6, drove local rubber prices lower.</p>
<p>&quot;We marked down our prices after Tokyo went down this morning,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;We're looking for leads this afternoon but the holidays in Indonesia and Malaysia may limit trade.&quot;</p>
<p>At around 0445 GMT, September RSS3 was indicated at 92.00-93.00 U.S. cents a kg from 93.25 cents. October TSR20 was indicated at 98.75 U.S. cents a kg from 99.75 cents.</p>
