<title>FRANCE: Prosecutor urges heavier sentence on France's Tapie.</title>
<headline>Prosecutor urges heavier sentence on France's Tapie.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-28</dateline>

<p>A French public prosecutor urged an appeal court on Friday to impose a heavier punishment on bankrupt business tycoon Bernard Tapie, who was given a six-month sentence for tax evasion in managing his luxury yacht.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Claude Fortin said the term should be raised to eight months. Tapie is already serving a separate eight-month jail term for rigging a soccer match.</p>
<p>The flamboyant former minister made his first public appearance since he was jailed almost two months ago at the appeal hearing which started on Thursday.</p>
<p>A court had previously convicted him for passing off the majestic 74-metre (245 ft), four-masted ship Phocea as a means of promoting his business, although he was its only beneficiary.</p>
<p>He vigorously defended himself against fraud charges.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not saying we were not at fault. But to come and tell me that all this was Machiavellian and calculated is total stupidity,&quot; he told the court.</p>
<p>Tapie, 54, has tumbled from political and business stardom since 1993, when he rigged a league match to give his team Marseille an easy game before their successful European Cup final against AC Milan.</p>
<p>The $11 million yacht, which at the height of Tapie's rise to wealth and fame was moored proudly in the old port of Marseille, has been seized and is on sale.</p>
