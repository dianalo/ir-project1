<headline>Wife of Oscar winner Thornton files for divorce.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>The wife of Academy Award winner Billy Bob Thornton filed for divorce on Friday, citing irreconcilable differences.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Pietra Dawn Thornton is also seeking custody of the couple's two children -- three-year-old William and two-year-old Harry James -- and wants spousal support and her attorney's fees to be paid by her husband.</p>
<p>The couple was married on Feb. 18, 1993, and separated on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The divorce filing came less than a month after Thornton won the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for &quot;Sling Blade&quot;, a film about a mentally handicapped man who is released from a mental institution 25 years after committing a double homicide.</p>
<p>Thornton was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and raised in the small town of Malvern. After seeing Elvis Presley in the movies, he said he wanted to be a rock star or a movie star.</p>
<p>He spent several years as a rock-and-roll singer and drummer in Arkansas, Texas and California before deciding to become an actor. In 1983 he moved to Los Angeles, took acting classes and struggled for several years until he landed a role in the television series &quot;The Outsiders.&quot;</p>
