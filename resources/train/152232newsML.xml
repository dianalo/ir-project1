<p>Israeli soldiers opened fire to disperse Palestinian stone-throwers on Tuesday after the funeral of a 10-year-old boy said to have been killed by a Jewish settler in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Witnesses said four Palestinians suffered teargas inhalation. One was hit on the head with a teargas canister.</p>
<p>The clashes began when 50 masked mourners, walking along a hilltop, threw stones at Israeli cars traveling on a road below used by Jewish settlers of the West Bank. Other mourners joined in, and the soldiers responded.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the soldiers fired live ammunition and rubber bullets and teargas.</p>
<p>During the funeral, about 5,000 mourners vowed to avenge the killing of Hilmi Shosha as his body was laid to rest in the cemetery in Husan village.</p>
<p>Mourners carried banners saying: &quot;Get the Nazis out of our land&quot; and &quot;The criminal settler must be hanged.&quot; They carried black and Palestinian flags and shouted slogans vowing to avenge the killing.</p>
<p>Witnesses said a settler had beaten the boy unconscious on suspicion of throwing stones on Sunday. He died on Monday.</p>
<p>Israel Radio said an autopsy performed in Tel Aviv showed that the boy died from internal bleeding in the brain caused by a sharp blow to the neck. Police said earlier there was no proof the settler caused the boy's death.</p>
<p>Police told Israel Radio the security chief of the settlement of Efrat was being held for questioning.</p>
