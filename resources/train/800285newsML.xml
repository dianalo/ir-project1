<p>European gas oil looks set to plod through winter well under $200 a tonne, weighed down by ample stocks that make a repeat of last season's spectacular rally highly unlikely, traders and analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Refiners trying to squeeze profits from a sloppy supply/demand balance are dreaming of a big freeze hiking demand in Germany, Europe's main heating oil market, or of a surge in Chinese demand drawing product east.</p>
<p>&quot;We're praying for a very cold winter,&quot; said British Petroleum analyst Garry Swaine.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless there is a sustained cold spell the market will be well supplied and there will be no sustained price spike,&quot; said Mohammad Abduljabbar, senior economist at Washington-based Petroleum Finance.</p>
<p>Analysts see spot heating oil in northwest Europe ranging around $170 a tonne with possible moves to $185 if German demand revives, but still well below the $250 a tonne peak on the front month screen in October 1996.</p>
<p>Most see the gas oil/Brent crude crack spread rising little above $4 a barrel from around $3.50 currently, compared to the giddy heights of $9.50 in early October 1996.</p>
<p>A battery of bearish factors is ranged against any recovery, most prominently a surge in stocks in the Atlantic Basin, healthy supply in the Far East and low planned refinery shutdowns in Europe.</p>
<p>In addition there will be no repeat of the extra drawdown in stocks carried out last year to make the new low sulphur diesel required by new European Union environmental specifications.</p>
<p>&quot;OECD middle distillate stocks have climbed well above year ago and are now tending to the high end of the normal range,&quot; said Swaine.</p>
<p>Swaine puts Atlantic Basin middle distillate stocks at 393 million barrels at end July 1997, in line with the long term average, well above 363 million barrels a year ago and 386 million barrels in the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>He defines Atlantic Basin as the United States plus European Union countries minus Sweden and excluding non-EU member Norway.</p>
<p>Middle distillate stocks in the 15 European Union countries plus Norway rose to 316 million barrels in July, 10.6 million barrels or 3.5 percent above a year earlier, according to the Euroilstock Foundation.</p>
<p>Planned refinery shutdowns will take out middle distillate output capacity of 487,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter 1997, compared to 660,000 bpd in the same period of 1996 and 730,000 in 1995, an oil major analyst said.</p>
<p>He put middle distillate capacity outage at 530,000 bpd in fourth quarter 1997, against 640,000 bpd in 1996 and 820,000 bpd in 1995.</p>
<p>Colin Birch, analyst at Purvin and Gertz, sees gas oil firming very modestly in early 1998 but still well below 1996 levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for the gasoil/diesel supply/demand balance through the remainder of this year still looks reasonably firm although not as strong as 1997,&quot; a Purvin and Gertz market outlook issued in July said.</p>
<p>Birch forecast cif NWE cargo prices to average around $165 a tonne in the third quarter before strengthening to $170 a tonne through the winter.</p>
<p>He said diesel's premium to heating oil would remain at around $4 a tonne in the third quarter before strengthening into the fourth as the cold properties of the two grades changes.</p>
<p>The Purvin Gertz July outlook expects diesel prices to average $171 a tonne in the third quarter of 1997, increasing to over $180 a tonne in the winter period.</p>
<p>Swaps show a lacklustre outlook. Swaps for the gas oil/Brent crack spread are at $4.45 for fourth quarter 1997 against an average $6.42 in the same quarter 1996.</p>
<p>Traders are plotting arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people will move oil regionally,&quot; said a trader in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region.</p>
<p>&quot;People will store oil in the hope that some region in the winter gets cold and needs oil. Looking ahead the arbs are hard to see but they will develop eventually.&quot;</p>
<p>Asian demand for European gas oil this winter looks likely to be distinctly underwhelming.</p>
<p>&quot;The region is still grappling with the consequence of the very large spring imports that have swelled stocks in the region,&quot; said Petro Finance.</p>
<p>Economic slowdown in the southeast Asian importers of Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines may not help either.</p>
<p>China's limited storage capacity could limit its import volumes despite rocketing demand.</p>
<p>But a London-based trader, looking one month ahead, was more optimistic that an arbitrage east from Europe was in the making.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not inconceivable now that the Far East responds quite aggressively to an upmove because it's been so bearish for the last month that you could argue that a lot of the oversupply is already built into the current price curve,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The unknown caveat in the Far East is how much China will come in and buy.&quot;</p>
