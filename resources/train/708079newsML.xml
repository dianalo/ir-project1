<p>Austria's ATX index of 21 blue chips continued its bull run on Friday, ending at a record closing high for the fifth day.</p>
<p>But the index, which ended 0.49 percent higher at 1,388.18, was driven off earlier highs as a flurry of profittaking kicked in, and traders said that while 1,400 points was within easy reach, the danger of a technical correction was mounting.</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite 100 points in one week. That doesn't leave that much more to be desired,&quot; said one trader in reference to the rally which has taken the ATX's gains to around seven percent since last Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The air was already pretty thin up there,&quot; said another trader, adding that profit-taking set in once the ATX hit a record intra-day high at 1,401.66 points.</p>
<p>But underlying market sentiment remains very positive. &quot;The futures contract is still very bullish. It could continue on,&quot; said a trader. But others said that a correction would be healthy and sensible for the market.</p>
<p>Winners outpaced losers with 13 ATX shares advancing, seven falling and one unchanged by the close.</p>
<p>The day's best performing ATX stock was brewery Brau Union, up 3.55 percent at 845 schillings while high-grade steelmaker Boehler-Uddeholm led decliners, losing 3.24 percent to 987 schillings.</p>
<p>The broad-based Vienna bourse index added on 0.46 percent to 499.32 points.</p>
<p>The July ATX future rose 6.5 points to 1,396.0 on volume of 1,713 contracts.</p>
