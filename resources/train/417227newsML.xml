<p>South African gold shares plunged almost five percent on Tuesday on the back of the combined effects of a stronger rand and a weaker bullion price, dealers said.</p>
<p>Industrial shares managed to stay in positive territory despite what dealers described as less than convincing gains on Wall Street overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been another quiet, sluggish day...Gold shares were under pressure on the accomodation of a strong rand and a weaker bullion price,&quot; Johan Marais, director at Societe Generale Frankel Pollack told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bullion fell below the $360 level in London on Tuesday afternoon to trade at around the $359 level at the local close, while the rand gained almost three cents against the dollar on the day amid London-based dollar demand.</p>
<p>De Beers was a feature on the day after the company reported earnings up 37 percent in the year to end December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>De Beers share promptly surged to a year high of 159.75 rand before succumbing to profit-taking later in the day.</p>
<p>It ended at 157.00 rand, down 50 cents after some 360,000 shares worth 57.03 million rand changed hands in 164 deals.</p>
<p>&quot;They ran up on the results but have come all the way down on a wave of profit taking,&quot; Marais said.</p>
<p>De Beers was seen picking up from current levels on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Comments by Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals' that he expected a more stable rand in 1997 and that economic growth would be close to three percent in 1997 were also seen as positive for the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said market attention would be focussed on Wall Street overnight and Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's second leg of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trade would also be cautions ahead of U.S. jobs numbers on Friday and the 1996/97 budget on March 12.  </p>
<p>The all gold index lost 70 points or 4.5 percent to 1,492.9, dragging the overall index down 21.2 points to 7,132.6 points. The industrial index was up 22.7 points to 8,284.0 points.</p>
<p>The gold board saw heavy losses with Dries off 5.94 percent, or 300 cents, to 47.50 rand, Freegold shed 6.92 percent, or 270 cents, to 36.30 rand and Kloof dropped 6.92 percent, or 275 cents, to 36.30 rand.</p>
<p>Engen lost 55 cents to 25.90 rand and Iscor gained 10 cents to 354 cents.  </p>
<p>Near-dated share futures were weak in quiet late trade, with golds off on a better rand and weaker bullion price, dealers said. Industrial contracts ended weak, unimpressed by Wall Street's stronger overnight finish.</p>
<p>The March industrial contract was last at 7,970/80 from 7,952, the all-share contract was at 6,491/99 from 6,510 and the gold contract was at 1,055/60 from 1,105.</p>
