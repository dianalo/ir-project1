<headline>S.Africa cabinet defers decision on Syria arms deal.</headline>
<dateline>PRETORIA 1997-01-22</dateline>

<p>South Africa's cabinet deferred a decision on a controversial proposed arms sale to Syria to a future meeting, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;These consultations have in fact not yet been concluded and the matter is being held over until a next meeting of cabinet,&quot; cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel told a news conference, adding that the decision would not necessarily be taken when the cabinet met again in two weeks' time.  </p>
<p>The cabinet had already given provisional approval to the sale, according to leaked cabinet minutes, pending the approval of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</p>
<p>South Africa says it is just one of several countries, including three unnamed European states, which are bidding for the $650 million contract. It also asserts that a U.S. defence contractor is involved in at least one of those bids.</p>
<p>The Pretoria government was angered by a U.S. threat to cut off aid over the proposed deal to provide tank-gun aiming systems to the Damascus government, which Washington regards as a state sponsor of terrorism. Syria denies it supports terrorists.</p>
<p>The electronic system provides computerised control of the mechanism that aims and fires the cannon in tanks and howitzers, making them many times more accurate -- something that has raised fears in Syria's arch-foe and neighbour, Israel.</p>
