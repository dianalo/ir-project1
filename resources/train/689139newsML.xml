<p>Debt-ridden Finance One Plc is facing an arranged merger following the failure of the Bank of Thailand to buy into the firm's rights issue as earlier promised.</p>
<p>Broker Krungthai Thanakit Plc, a subsidiary of state-owned commercial lender Krung Thai Bank Plc, would be the white knight for the merger, a senior government sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>Without the central bank's direct assistance, a forced merger was the most likely outcome for Finance One, once the leading finance company in the country, they added.</p>
<p>Finance One president Pin Chakkapak announced plans to raise 8.28 billion baht ($330 million) in new capital through a huge rights issue in June. The central bank had said in May it would take all unsubscribed shares.</p>
<p>But as the subscription book closed on Wednesday it became clear the bank had reneged on its pledge following government decrees earlier this week that enhanced regulators' powers to force finance firm mergers.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided not to buy shares because we have a new choice. After the new decrees we will provide the company with a new choice of merging with other companies,&quot; said Sawangchit Chaiyawat, manager of the central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund.</p>
<p>The central bank has previously intervened directly to assist ailing firms.</p>
<p>How hard the authorities will now be on ailing finance firms remains unclear, but bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond has conveyed a message to the fund that spending to assist ailing firms will be more selective, Sawangchit said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to follow the policy (of spending more selectively). It is difficult to say, (whether this a change of policy) we'll have to wait and see,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the executive decrees...the government can, and most likely will, force a merger on Finance One. This time the authorities will be able to dictate more of the terms,&quot; said Kannika Chamlongsupalak, finance analyst at Thaimex Finance and Securities Plc, in a report on Thursday.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of a proposed merger to medium-sized commercial bank Thai Danu Bank Plc in May, the fate of Finance One has been unclear.</p>
<p>The firm has struggled to cope with deteriorating asset quality brought about by a severe Thai economic downturn.</p>
<p>A liquidity crunch early this week forced Finance One to announce plans to reschedule $46 million of debts to overseas creditors.</p>
<p>Finance One officials have remained silent and no comment was available from the company.</p>
<p>Krungthai Thanakit, meanwhile, has responded cautiously to the merger talk.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not received any approach through the central bank and no approach from any government officials yet. I don't think they will force us to do anything that is not suitable to us, and we would have to study any proposal carefully,&quot; KTT Executive Director Sukhum Yongvanijchit told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts remain to be convinced that the two firms are certain to be brought together.</p>
<p>The harder line that the authorities might be taking and a further decree allowing greater foreign ownership of Thai finance firms could yet open other possibilities, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the government may have run the KTT idea up the flagpole to see what the market makes of it,&quot; said one senior foreign analyst.</p>
