<p>Two of Kazakhstan's biggest banks, Turanbank and Alem Bank, merged on Wednesday into a new state-owned institution to avert bankruptcy which could have hit the Kazakh economy, senior officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Old rumours about a possible merger of the two banks have been finally confirmed. It took place today,&quot; National (central) Bank chairman Uraz Dzhandosov told a news conference.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Alexander Pavlov told the news conference the decision had been taken jointly by the government and the National Bank after the two banks had amassed negative capital of some eight billion tenge ($105.9 million).</p>
<p>Pavlov said the government had earlier on Wednesday bought out all shares from both banks at their nominal value for &quot;a few hundred thousand tenge&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, the shareholders will suffer, and this is obvious because they have driven the banks to such a condition... But account-holders will not suffer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bank, 100-percent owned by the state, will be called Bank Turan-Alem.</p>
<p>Pavlov said the government put $25 million as an initial payment to the new bank's capital.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like the new bank to have capital equivalent to today's aggregate negative capital of Alem and Turan, or some eight billion tenge,&quot; Dzhandosov told Reuters after the news conference.</p>
<p>Pavlov said the government would look for a strategic investor for the new bank to boost its capital further. One possibility was the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he said.</p>
<p>Dzhandosov said the weak financial state of the banks was largely due to the economic crisis dating back to 1993-1995. The two banks were serving too many loss-making state companies and their managements had not reacted quickly enough to rapidly changing economic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking into account that the economic situation is to a large extent dependent on these two banks, we decided to take this decision,&quot; Pavlov said.</p>
<p>He said that over 18,000 local companies had accounts at Turanbank and about 10,000 at Alem Bank. Turanbank was Kazakhstan's second largest in terms of private account-holders, with some 500,000 private accounts. About 100,000 private persons had accounts at Alem Bank.</p>
<p>Turanbank's privatisation was completed in August 1995. The state had a 53-percent stake in Alem Bank.</p>
<p>Banks mushroomed in Kazakhstan after independence from the Soviet Union, when hyperinflation and negative real interest rates made borrowing money the easiest way to get rich.</p>
<p>But later many banks could not adapt to slowing inflation amidst first signs of economic stabilisation. Dzhandosov said the number of Kazakh banks had dropped to 100 in November 1996 from 240 in early 1994.</p>
<p>The authorities have avoided allowing major banks go bankrupt. Alem Bank was put under temporary central bank management in February 1996. Turanbank underwent the same procedure in September.</p>
