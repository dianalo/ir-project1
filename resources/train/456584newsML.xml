<p>President Bill Clinton may have to delay upcoming trips to Mexico and Latin America until after he fully recovers from knee surgery, his spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some need to think about that,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters when asked whether the president's planned goodwill visits to countries south of the U.S. border would be postponed.</p>
<p>Clinton, who underwent knee surgery last Friday after tearing a tendon in a stumble at the Florida home of Australian golf pro Greg Norman, is in a wheelchair for his Helsinki summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>&quot;The trip to Latin America was designed to be much different from a meeting like this, which is in a sense, a face-to-face meeting to really work through issues,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>Clinton is scheduled to be in Mexico on April 11-12, and visit five Latin American countries -- Barbados, Costa Rica, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela -- from May 6 to May 13.</p>
<p>McCurry said the president's trips to Latin America were to be ones where he &quot;engages more fully with the people ... and travels,&quot; which would be difficult to do with the limited mobility that will plague Clinton for the next several weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have to kind of look at the schedule and think about it as we think ahead. But we'll let you know if there are any changes in our plans,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
