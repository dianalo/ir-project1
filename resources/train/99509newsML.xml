<headline>Iliescu, 15 rivals in Romanian presidential race.</headline>

<p>Sixteen candidates have entered Romania's presidential election next month, the third in six years, with ex-Communist incumbent Ion Iliescu bidding for four more years running the Balkan country.</p>
<p>But with entries closed at the weekend, only two opponents in the colourful field are given a serious chance of ousting Iliescu, who has led Romania since the aftermath of a 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.</p>
<p>Thousands of hopefuls are running for seats in two houses of parliament, where Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy (PDSR) runs a real risk of being overtaken as the largest party.</p>
<p>Iliescu, 66, portrays himself as the patriarch of post-Communist politics able to maintain stability.</p>
<p>&quot;What is at stake is how to change Romania's destiny at the end of the century and bridge the gap with the developed world,&quot; he said as the campaign got under way last month.</p>
<p>The president's opponents say he is a remnant of the old order in the sole east European state since the fall of Communism yet to put the opposition into power.</p>
<p>The race, with a variety of also-rans defending lost causes or special interests, has produced a lively poster campaign.</p>
<p>It has also run into scandal, with Iliescu's opponents accusing his party last week of conducting a &quot;fake&quot; telephone opinion poll with loaded questions intended to swing the results in his favour. Human rights groups say election rules have been twisted to help the incumbent and his party.</p>
<p>Sociologists say up to a third of voters, particularly young people, are so disillusioned by lack of change that they will not vote. But many Romanians, particularly in rural areas, appear to be heeding Iliescu's pitch for continuity.</p>
<p>Notoriously unreliable opinion polls credit him with 36 percent of the vote in the November 3 first round, far short of the 50 percent needed for outright victory without a run-off.</p>
<p>Emil Constantinescu, head of the Democratic Convention made up of 15-odd disparate parties, gets 28 percent. He ran a distant second to Iliescu in the 1992 election.</p>
<p>Third with 21 percent is Social Democrat Petre Roman, forced from office as reformist prime minister in 1991 following violent anti-government protests by coal miners.</p>
<p>But the PDSR was given a severe pasting by the opposition in local elections last June, when even its star candidate, former tennis player Ilie Nastase, lost the race for Bucharest mayor. Polls show the party to be trailing again.</p>
<p>All three top presidential contenders agree on pursuing market reforms and stepping up the drive for eventual membership of the NATO alliance and the European Union.</p>
<p>But Iliescu says Constantinescu's proposals for tax cuts will ruin the economy and accuses him of endangering Romania's stability by wanting to bring back the monarchy.</p>
<p>His opponents vow their parties will have nothing to do with the PDSR in any post-election coalition horse-trading.</p>
<p>The size of the field, compared to six in 1992 and three in 1990, poses logistical problems, with free radio and television time strictly rationed. All 16 candidates are expected to crowd into a television studio for a debate in the final days.</p>
<p>Among other contenders are a candidate representing the 1.6 million-strong Hungarian minority, an eccentric city mayor opposing minority rights, Ceausescu's former &quot;court poet&quot; and a faith healer hoping to cure Romania's ills with &quot;bio-energy&quot;.</p>
