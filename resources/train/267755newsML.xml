<p>The staff committee of Moulinex, made up of elected employee representatives, opposes a drastic restructuring plan unveiled in June, Moulinex said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that 15 representatives on the committee, which met on Thursday, opposed the plan and three were in favour.</p>
<p>But the company said it planned to push ahead with the plan, which was announced six months ago and entails 2,100 job losses and two plant closures in France. The management said, however, that it was prepared to resume negotiations aimed at saving jobs through reduced work schedules on January 8.</p>
<p>Moulinex will report its first-half 1996/97 results on Friday afternoon, and chairman Pierre Blayau will hold a meeting with financial analysts beginning at 1600 GMT.</p>
<p>Moulinex reported a loss of 702 million francs for 1995/96 -- its fourth consecutive annual loss -- after taking a 600 million charge for the restructuring, which it said was crucial to allow it to match the performance of its competitors.</p>
