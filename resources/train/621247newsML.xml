<p>Tanzania's coffee crop is likely to rise to between 700,000 and 750,000 bags in 1997/98 from about 600,000 in 1996/97, Swiss coffee firm Schluter Trading said.</p>
<p>The company said in its May 20 report and made available to Reuters on Wednesday that northern Tanzanian crop was unlikely to reach 200,000 bags due to poor rainfall. This compares with 260,000 bags in 1996/97.</p>
<p>But southern Tanzania could yield an excellent harvest as rainfall had been good. The area could produce as much as 350,000 bags, up sharply from 185,000 in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Schluter noted that Tanzanian coffee sector had set itself the target of restoring average production to 1.0 million bags by 2002.</p>
<p>The 1997/98 season would see vouchers which could be exchanged for farm inputs. This, the company said, should result in greater investment in coffee by farmers.</p>
<p>In Kenya, Schluter said the rains finally came across the country at the beginning of April, and seemed to have been heavier than in recent years.</p>
<p>&quot;There is also concern in some quarters about the flowering for the main 1997/98 crop, but it is too early to have a clear indication of what to expect,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It also said the high world prices would encourage investment of inputs and labour into the smallholder sector and this should help start improving overall volumes for the coming years.</p>
<p>The company kept its 1996/97 crop estimate at 78,000 to 80,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>In Uganda, the rains finally came in April and this has brought relief to the coffee belt especially in Central Uganda, Schluter said.</p>
<p>Robusta arrivals in Kampala had dwindled to a trickle in recent weeks as the main crop had come to an end.</p>
<p>Coffee from western Uganda was only just beginning to appear as supplies had been delayed by the rains and drying of the available supplies were taking time.</p>
<p>In Zaire, exports of agricultural commodities were returning to normal in the eastern part of the country after recent political turmoil.</p>
<p>Schluter said there were signs that some replanting of coffee was already beginning to take place, encouraged no doubt by both the current market, as well as the new political environment. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
