<p>The governor of one of Colombia's most violent provinces called on Tuesday for U.N. peace-keeping troops to be drafted into the area to safeguard human rights.</p>
<p>Alvaro Uribe, governor of Antioquia province close to the border with Panama, said an international force should be deployed in the province's trouble-torn, banana-growing region of Uraba, where leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads have killed with impunity for more than a decade.</p>
<p>In the latest incident, investigators said they had unearthed five corpses in shallow graves near the town of Apartado, which was also the site of a massive car bomb attack last week in which 11 people died.</p>
<p>&quot;A request from Colombia for armed support from the U.N...would reaffirm our sovereignty and show the international community this is a respectable state that wishes to regain respect for human rights,&quot; Uribe told reporters after a meeting in the provincial capital, Medellin.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Samper rejected a similar request by Uribe last year, saying an international force would be seen as a violation of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Samper and army commanders, not wanting to give an international dimension to Colombia's three-deacade-old guerrilla uprising, have also ruled out all offers of assistance from foreign leaders to mediate with Marxist rebels.</p>
<p>Uribe's critics blame him for fuelling the violence through covert backing of right-wing paramilitary groups and open sponsorship of anti-guerrilla civilian self-defence committees, known as Convivirs.</p>
<p>International human rights groups have criticised the Convivirs, whose members have the right to bear weapons, as little more than legalised death squads.</p>
<p>The discovery of the five dead men near Apartado appeared to demonstrate Uraba's spiral of tit-for-tat violence.</p>
<p>Local officials said the victims from the village of San Jose -- known as a hotbed of rebel support -- were probably killed by paramilitary groups in revenge for last Thursday's bomb attack, which was blamed on guerrillas.</p>
