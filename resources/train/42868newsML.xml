<title>USA: IBM in global electronic commerce deal.</title>
<headline>IBM in global electronic commerce deal.</headline>

<p>International Business Machines Corp.'s new Internet Division was to unveil a worldwide alliance Tuesday aimed at promoting international electronic commerce on a global scale.</p>
<p>The new alliance, to be announced at an electronic commerce trade show in Anaheim, Calif., will link IBM with Washington, D.C.-based Universal Business Exchange, or UNIBEX, executives of both companies said.</p>
<p>More than half a dozen major organisations with global reach will join in the project, they said.</p>
<p>Mady Jalinous, chairman of UNIBEX, which has previously been known as the IBEX Global Business Alliance, said the new system would assist in electronically matching parties in different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Jalinous said the alliance would aim to &quot;expand our vision of what is electronic commerce&quot; by making it easier for organisations using different languages and different customs to communicate and trade.</p>
<p>In many ways, the network aims to create new marketplaces where cultural and geographical barriers have created inefficiencies, Jalinous told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>In conjunction with IBM and using the Entrust technology for secure electronic commerce for which IBM has purchased rights from Northern Telecom, UNIBEX will offer a variety of services to support a unified commerce model.</p>
<p>Key to the effort, Jalinous said, is the ability to issue and administer electronic signitures on a global basis, with IBM providing the technology and UNIBEX the administration.</p>
<p>UNIBEX plans to offer services ranging from market research and mass-marketing to generating qualified leads and purchase order invoices, he said.</p>
<p>Jalinous said the goal was to offer businesses in Djakarta and Seattle, for example, the ability to engage in commerce with no additional costs or risks compared with established business partnerships at closer range.</p>
<p>The services will take advantage of IBM's global computing network as well as, eventually, the Internet, enabling users to &quot;point and click their way&quot; between internal corporate networks, or Intranets, and the public domain.</p>
<p>Other members of the alliance are the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, accountancy firm Deloitte &amp; Touche, ATT Corp., Dun and Bradstreet, Simon &amp; Shuster, and Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
<p>The participants will contribute content, services, distribution channels and technology, according to Colby Mims, special projects manager at IBM's Internet unit.</p>
<p>Jalinous said he expects 35,000 subscribers in 1997 and that even by conservative estimates, he projects 1.8 million in the fifth year.</p>
<p>Small and medium-size enterprises might pay $1,500 to $4,000 for the service, while larger firms could pay tens of thousands of dollars, he added. Jalinous expects to raise additional funds with a public stock offering, possibly in 1997.</p>
