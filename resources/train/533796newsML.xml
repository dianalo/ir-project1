<p>Singapore opposition politician Tang Liang Hong has lost the last of 13 lawsuits for defamation brought against him by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and ruling party members, a lawyer for Goh said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The lawyer said the Singapore High Court ruled on Tuesday that Tang had libelled Goh in an interview with the daily Straits Times published on January 11 in which he said he feared for his safety and was concerned he would be arrested.</p>
<p>Tang was an unsuccessful candidate for the Worker's Party in Singapore's January 2 general election and fled the city state shortly afterwards saying he feared for his life.</p>
<p>Goh's People's Action Party (PAP) won 81 of the 83 parliamentary seats in the polls.</p>
<p>Tang told the pro-government newspaper in the interview he was afraid of returning to Singapore because he feared arrest under Singapore's Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows detention without trial for up to two years.</p>
<p>Tang questioned whether he should believe assurances given by the prime minister that he would not be arrested.</p>
<p>In his judgement against Tang, published in the Straits Times on Wednesday, Justice Lai Kew Chai said the offending words conveyed the meaning that Goh was not an honest, trustworthy man of integrity.</p>
<p>He said it suggested Goh would use his power corruptly and illegally to arrest Tang under the ISA.</p>
<p>The High Court previously ruled in 12 separate suits that Tang had defamed Goh and 10 other members of the ruling PAP.</p>
<p>It had earlier ordered Tang and his wife to declare all their assests and to set aside Singapore $11.2 million (US$7.8 million) to cover damages if he was found guilty.</p>
<p>Goh's lawyer, who declined to be identified, said the plantiffs would ask the court for aggravated damages in addition to damages caused by the defamation.</p>
<p>The hearing to determine costs would be heard in the High Court on May 5 and more than 50 people, mainly journalists, could be called to give evidence.</p>
<p>The first set of libel suits was brought against Tang for remarks he made about Goh, former premier Lee Kuan Yew and other PAP members during the general election campaign.</p>
<p>During the campaign, the PAP accused Tang of being a &quot;Chinese chauvinist&quot; who threatened racial harmony in Singapore, where over 70 percent of the population are ethnic Chinese but where there are also significant numbers of Malays and Indians.</p>
<p>Tang denied the allegations and said the PAP leaders had lied. He was hit by a deluge of suits for these and other remarks, which were reported in local and foreign newspapers.</p>
