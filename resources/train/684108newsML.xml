<p>Turkey's High Board of Privatisation is to rule on the delayed sale of Etibank after the agreed buyer failed to make the necessary downpayment, the Privatisation Administration Board (OIB) said in a statement.</p>
<p>Textile producer Dogan Kumascilik made a successful $185 million bid in March for Etibank, the second state bank to be privatised under a government sell-off programme.</p>
<p>But the company failed to meet a deadline, extended to June 23, to pay a deposit of 200 billion lira ($1.4 million), the administration board said.</p>
<p>It said it had transferred a previous 200 billion lira deposit to the privatisation fund.</p>
<p>According to the agreement signed in March, Dogan Kumascilik was to make a cash downpayment of $74 million and pay the remaining sum over two years.</p>
<p>Analysts said the OIB could decide to sell the bank to the second highest bidder, Diler Holding, which offered a price of $181 million.</p>
<p>They also said the tender could be cancelled and the bank might be offered for sale from scratch.</p>
<p>The government sold Sumerbank, the first bank to be sold off, for $103.5 million in 1995 to a textiles and brewery and company.</p>
