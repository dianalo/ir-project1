<headline>Czech PX50 closes up, high caps lose early gains.</headline>

<p>The Czech PX50 index closed slightly higher on Monday but blue chips shares declined sharply from the morning price fixing.</p>
<p>The PX50 closed 0.1 percent higher at 584.5 while the major issue dominated RPIX index lost 0.02 percent to 1,231.6.</p>
<p>Dealers said blue chip gains at the morning fixing -- Komercni Banka closed up 10 crowns at 2,610 after being up 78 crowns at the fix and CEZ closed up five crowns at 1,110 after being up 18 crowns -- had probably been unrealistic and made on the back of thin volumes.</p>
<p>However, they expected prices to recover later in the week pushing the index up.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the market could go a bit higher...the correction of the blue chips was quite strong (last week),&quot; said Kusacek.</p>
<p>The PX50's biggest share, SPT Telecom lost 49 crowns, 1.3 percent, to 3,661 but Kusacek said he did not see anything significant behind the fall adding that foreign investors, who are normally heavily involved in the blue chips, were not very active in the market on Monday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, tobacco company Tabak, 77 percent owned by Philip Morris, surged 199 crowns, 2.5 percent, to 8,300.</p>
