<headline>Daiwa terms Warsaw bourse sell-off buy opportunity.</headline>
<dateline>WARSAW 1997-03-21</dateline>

<p>A sell-off of shares on the Warsaw bourse would create a short-term buying opportunity, Daiwa Europe Limited said in its Equity Strategy Quarterly for Central and Eastern Europe dated February 28.</p>
<p>Since the report the bourse has fallen nine percent to 15,969.9 points</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, a sell-off would present a short-term buying opportunity, with the caveat that we are likely to see a softer market from the second half of the year,&quot; Daiwa said.</p>
<p>It said it had lowered its weighting of the Polish market by 10 percent, with its year-end target at 19,500, and that listed firms should increase nominal earnings by 23 percent this year after the approximate 20-percent growth in 1996.</p>
<p>It said the bourse's 1996 price-earnings of 14 on February 28 and 11 for 1997 were in line with those of Hungary and some Latin American markets but cheaper than the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Daiwa said the second half's softer market would result from several possible large initial public offerings this year, such as those of copper giant  KGHM Polska Miedz SA and paper firm Celuloza Swiecie SA, as well as secondary issues.</p>
<p>It said the expected listing of National Investment Funds (NFIs) on the bourse this year should also draw capital from listed stocks in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;However, over the medium term, the added supply will boost market capitalisation, bring more selection and more large-cap stocks to the market, and add to liquidity,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Daiwa also said politics would become more of an issue as parliamentary elections due in the fourth quarter approached.</p>
<p>It said fixed income instruments would likely prove a stronger competitor for capital as real returns improve under a tighter monetary policy environment and gradually slowing inflation.</p>
<p>But it said that despite recent higher market rates the central bank would find it difficult to raise official interest rates before the vote despite the need to curb domestic demand.</p>
<p>Daiwa continued to recommend Mostostal Warszawa, Prochem, Forte, Vistula and Polifarb Cieszyn, which along with Polifarb Wroclaw should benefit from their planned merger, it said.</p>
