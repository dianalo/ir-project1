<p>Finnish banking group Merita Oy hopes its credit losses can fall to 0.5 percent of net liabilities in the coming two years, but does not see this as a forecast, the president of its banking unit said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know what this year's credit losses will be but ... hopefully the level is about 0.5 percent of net liabilities, which is then significantly lower than last year when they were 0.75 or 0.80 (percent),&quot; Pertti Voutilainen told Reuters.</p>
<p>Merita said in its May 7 Q1 report it expected loan losses to fall significantly from the 1996 level, but gave no figures.</p>
<p>Voutilainen said he was commenting on a research note from brokerage Enskilda Securities in Helsinki, which he said had cited him specifying a level for Merita's forecast credit losses this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to and cannot give such precise figures,&quot; Voutilainen said. The research note he was discussing was not made available to Reuters. Enskilda earlier had no comment.</p>
<p>In 1996, the bank's 1.51 billion markka loan losses were 0.7 percent of Merita loans and guarantees.</p>
<p>These it defines as receivables from the public and public sector, leased assets, debt held as fixed assets, guarantee claims and commitments given on behalf of customers in favour of third parties.</p>
<p>A Merita spokeswoman said Enskilda analysts had visited Voutilainen on Tuesday and written a report which she said had a target share price of 34 markka for Merita if the group can reach management's targets. She did not specify a time period.</p>
<p>Merita shares jumped on Wednesday on lively demand with many brokers active: Goldman Sachs earlier this week initiated coverage of Merita with a market outperform stance, and brokers on Wednesday also referred to talk of the Enskilda report.</p>
<p>Voutilainen added Merita still aimed to pay back the state's capital certificates &quot;within the next couple of years&quot;, but had no target date.</p>
<p>He said Merita aims to continue selling off its 25.4 billion markka real estate portfolio: half of the total would be good &quot;although it would not be in any way realistic target in the short term -- hopefully in the long run&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>Voutilainen repeated Merita's plan to cut its payroll by 600 staff this year and by 300-400 annually after that, but said it did not want to forecast the level of staff in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Merita's stock closed just short of its 19.50 markka intrasession year-high, at 19.40 markka, up 1.40.</p>
