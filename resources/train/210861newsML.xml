<title>FRANCE: French truckers disrupt Shell fuel deliveries.</title>

<p>A blockade by French truckers is starting to hamper petrol and other fuel deliveries from the Berre refinery run by Royal Dutch/Shell in southern France, a refinery spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>Truckers whose five-day-old protest over pay had already disrupted traffic near the plant were now blocking access to the refinery's loading terminal for trucks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the loadings by truck have been halted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>About one third of the refinery's oil product output of 15,000-20,000 tonnes a day leaves the plant by road, he added.</p>
<p>Production at the refinery was not affected, he said.  </p>
<p>Petrochemical deliveries, some of which depend entirely on road transport, had already been hit during an earlier stage of the strike, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Shell refinery, one of four large plants grouped around Marseille, and which together make up the biggest Mediterranean refining centre, appears to have been singled out because of its location near major road arteries, oil industry sources said.</p>
<p>Other plants run by BP, Esso and Total appeared broadly unaffected, they said.</p>
<p>Normally 100 chemical trucks and at least as many fuel trucks leave Shell's Berre plant every day, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>He said Shell was trying to make sure petrol stations and industrial users of polymers and other petrochemicals got their deliveries on time by making arrangements with other companies.</p>
<p>Industry officials in Paris said the strike appeared to have left several depots short of fuel, especially in southeastern and southwestern France.</p>
<p>More depots were hit on Friday but it was hard to say how many were involved, an UFIP industry association official said.</p>
<p>Prime Minisater Alain Juppe called on Friday for a quick end to the strike after talks between truckers and haulage bosses broke down overnight.</p>
