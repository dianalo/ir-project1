<p>Chelsea's Italian forward Gianfranco Zola says he might leave England to play in his native Sardinia after next year's World Cup finals in France.</p>
<p>In an interview published by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper on Monday, Zola said he wanted to wind down his career at Calgiari, who were relegated to serie B last season.</p>
<p>&quot;Without new stimuli a footballer doesn't exist,&quot; said Zola, who has been a huge success at Chelsea since he joined them from Parma in November 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I've decided, if it's possible in a year's time, or maybe two, to end my career with Calgiari.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, I'm only speaking hypothetically. I don't even know if Calgiari will get back into serie A and, if they do, if they'll want me.&quot;</p>
<p>Zola, who turns 31 this Saturday, said he saw the 1998 World Cup finals in France as his last chance to exorcise the ghosts of the 1994 World Cup in the United States and last year's European championships in England.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of going from the very big to the very little, to chase the biggest victory of all with the national team and then to champion the cause of my homeland...it would be a change of perspective,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the States, Zola was sent off for the only time in his career in a match against Nigeria. The dismissal, after the little Sardinian had been on the pitch just 11 minutes, was widely regarded as one of the worst refereeing decisions in World Cup history.</p>
<p>At Euro 96, Zola missed a penalty in a first round match against Germany. The game ended 0-0 and, as a result, Italy were eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;I still have one (tournament) left, in 1998, to break the spell,&quot; Zola told La Gazzetta. &quot;I'm ready&quot;.</p>
