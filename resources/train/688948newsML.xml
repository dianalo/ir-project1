<p>Colombian President Ernesto Samper said on Thursday he was cutting more than 3,000 government jobs to plug a gaping fiscal deficit and &quot;debureaucratize the state.&quot;</p>
<p>Samper, who announced the job cuts in a speech at the National School of Public Administration, said they would affect employees in a dozen ministries and state-run offices and 17 embassies and consulates worldwide.</p>
<p>He also said a freeze on new hiring by the central government would take effect on July 1 and some government offices, including the National Board of Tourism, were being shut down completely.</p>
<p>In a warning to the country's bureaucrats, Samper said the job cuts and streamlining of government offices were the first of many steps toward a &quot;rationalization&quot; of government services that would be accomplished before he left office in August 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to begin once and for all to fight bureaucracy,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm going to hand over a clean and orderly house,&quot; he added, alluding to the end of his term.</p>
<p>Samper estimated the job cuts and elimination of some government offices would save up to $100 million a year.</p>
<p>He said he was creating one new government post, however, before the July 1 hiring freeze. He said he would soon appoint a special ombudsman to investigate what critics describe as the many human rights violations committed by the military-run National Police.</p>
