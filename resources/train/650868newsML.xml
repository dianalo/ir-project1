<p>UK electricity watchdog Offer on Tuesday rejected a report criticising a lack of competition in the power generation market.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the regulator said power station disposals forced on National Power Plc and PowerGen Plc last year had yet to have their full effect, adding that new supply was coming on stream which would increase competition.</p>
<p>However, she said the regulator had been concerned about competition in power generation in the past and was keeping the market under review.  </p>
<p>A report in the Financial Times earlier highlighted the findings of the study, which criticised the workings of the power generation market.</p>
<p>The FT said a review of the electricity market by a consultancy called London Economics, compiled for East Midlands Electricity, argued that the generators had an interest in preventing competition in retail electricity supply.</p>
<p>The consultancy said consumers would fail to benefit unless the two big generators were forced to sell more generating capacity, the FT said.</p>
<p>It also argued that the generators should be stopped from making long-term contracts with electricity distributors since such deals could inhibit competition in generation, locking consumers into high prices.</p>
<p>Taking up the theme, the FT's Lex column said proper competition was lacking in the power generation market and it may be difficult to tackle the problem without attacking the generators' remaining market position.</p>
<p>The report undercut shares in National Power, down 6-1/2p at 521 by 1009 GMT, and PowerGen, down 2-1/2p at 676-1/2.</p>
<p>The Offer spokeswoman said UK generating capacity was due to increase by some 13 percent by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Officials at National Power and PowerGen had no immediate comment on the report.</p>
