<p>Sweden will not be among core countries joining Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) from its planned start on January 1, 1999, economists concluded on Monday after the European Union (EU) summit in Dublin.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Goran Persson did not say anything new about the Swedish view to EMU during the meeting, merely reiterating that the decision about possible participation will be made in autumn 1997.</p>
<p>But he stressed Sweden's hesitancy towards EMU.</p>
<p>Persson also questioned how the budget stability pact, which was agreed at the summit, would work. However, he said the pact was probably both necessary and important. His tone differed from several other EU leaders who hailed the agreement as an important step toward EMU.</p>
<p>Carl Hamilton, head economist at Swedish banking group Handelsbanken, said that Persson had the opportunity to take a more positive stand on EMU in Dublin.</p>
<p>&quot;He could have interpreted the result (of the summit) as though increased clarity had been achieved,&quot; Hamilton said.</p>
<p>Hamilton said Persson just wanted to brush the EMU issue aside. &quot;I think they (the minority Social Democratic government) will say that we will wait for membership until after 1999.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas Pousette at Nordbanken said the main &quot;tip&quot; was that Sweden will not join the EMU from the start despite fulfilling convergence criteria to join.</p>
<p>&quot;The dilemma is political, not economical,&quot; he said, referring to the sceptical opinion both among the Social Democrats and among Swedes in general.</p>
<p>Wike Groenenberg at investment bank Salomon Brothers noted that Persson spoke neither for nor against EMU membership recently.</p>
<p>&quot;He has attempted to get a discussion going for quite some time, without really getting involved himself,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Social Democratic leaders will not actively favour EMU membership, the chance is very small that Sweden will join just after the start,&quot; she said, adding &quot;forget 1999&quot;.</p>
