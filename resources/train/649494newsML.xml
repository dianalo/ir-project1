<p>Volumes fell away on Tuesday on the Estonian bourse, with interest in Hansapank and Hoiupank sustaining the market.</p>
<p>But dealers said the low liquidity was exaggerating price movements. Total trade on the main list was 26.2 million kroons with the Talse 0.78 percent higher at 253.36.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the price changes we saw today were too great for the volume,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Low liquidity on the bourse is affecting the prices more than news,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hoiupank was most traded with 8.1 million kroons moved for a small price gain of 0.42 kroons to reach 132.27 kroons.</p>
<p>&quot;Its price is traded on a bit of a premium compared to the rest of the market, but its results are solid and its earnings are getting better,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Hansapank rose 2.05 kroons to 132.90 kroons on trade worth 6.3 million kroons.</p>
<p>Its shares have also been boosted slightly by news that it would consider offers from foreign banks for a partnership although it was not actively seeking an investor.</p>
<p>The free market turned over 2.5 million kroons with Tallinna Kaubamaja the most active stock with a trade of 0.8 million kroons. Kaubamaja picked up 0.40 kroons to close on 41.90 kroons.</p>
