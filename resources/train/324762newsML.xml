<title>USA: Blue-chip stocks weighed down by IBM loss.</title>
<headline>Blue-chip stocks weighed down by IBM loss.</headline>

<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks fell Wednesday, spurred by an earnings-driven sell-off in the shares of International Business Machines Corp., but other technology stocks continued to move higher.</p>
<p>At 1:25 p.m. EST, the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average was off 46.95 points at 6,836.95, pulling back after chalking up its 10th record close of the year on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues beat advances by a 13-11 margin on moderate volume of 336 million shares.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with high-tech issues, rose 7.54 points to 1,384.51. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.13 at 590.07.</p>
<p>IBM, which was down 8-1/4 at 159-3/4, accounted for about half of the Dow's drop.</p>
<p>&quot;IBM is 34 points of the Dow's drop,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. &quot;But Intel and Microsoft are putting on a spectacular show. The deployment of funds into these two first tier names continues unabated.&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. added 2-3/8 to 97-3/8 while Intel Corp. rallied 1-7/16 to 149-1/2.</p>
<p>The blue-chip market received little help from a soft bond market. The benchmark 30-year Treasury was steady with the yield unchanged at 6.79 percent.</p>
<p>Bleier said strength in tech stocks and the narrow decline in the broader market despite the sell-off in blue chips pointed to the resilience of the overall market.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people will view the drop in IBM as a buying opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;If we had a more skittish market, the IBM sell-off would have resulted in an across the board rout. But this market just appears to be bullet-proof.&quot;</p>
<p>IBM tumbled as analysts cut their earnings estimates for the world's largest computer maker after it posted lower profit margins and disappointing hardware revenues in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;On a bigger scale, though, the techs are far from done,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;Most of the tech earnings have met or exceeded earnings expectations, and by and large this sector of the market remains healthy.&quot;</p>
<p>Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said that if one subtracted IBM from the equation in Wednesday's trading, the market would be a big yawn.</p>
<p>&quot;Without IBM we would be having a normal little pause to refresh on the Dow. I don't see a serious downside risk to this market at this point,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>IBM was not the day's only loser among technology stocks. Computer Associates International fell three to 43 after the the company also reported disappointing results.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer Corp. was up 5-5/8 at 83-7/8 on upbeat profits for the latest quarter.</p>
