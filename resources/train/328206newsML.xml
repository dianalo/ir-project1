<p>&quot;We're not here to give travel information, we're here to kill,&quot; a French foreign legionnaire with a Hungarian accent rebuffed a traveller in the Paris Metro (underground railway), a police union said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Leaders of the FASP uniformed policemen's union went to Prime Minister Alain Juppe's office on Wednesday to complain at the conduct of the legionnaires, sent to reinforce them as part of a security deployment after a December 3 bomb on a Paris commuter train killed four people and wounded nearly 100.</p>
<p>A union spokeswoman said some legionnaires had hurled racist insults and levelled assault rifles at non-white travellers and carried out identity checks they were not empowered to conduct.</p>
<p>Questioned about the complaints, Defence Ministry spokesman Pierre Servent told reporters: &quot;No notable incidents have been reported to us.&quot; Military sources said the complaint might result from police jealously at the military presence.</p>
<p>Under the Vigipirate security plan, 3,000 soldiers have been deployed in the Paris area. Units of one policemen and three or four soldiers patrol the vast metro system and train stations and airports together.</p>
<p>Only the policeman is allowed to make spot identity checks.</p>
<p>Some 320 legionnaires were drafted in for the first time on January 7. They patrolled the metro until January 21 when they returned to their bases in southeast France.</p>
<p>Algerian Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas who claimed responsibility for an earlier wave of bombings in 1995 are suspected of being behind the December blast, which involved an identical bomb concealed in a gas cylinder.</p>
<p>The newspaper Le Monde said policemen quoted one legionnaire as saying: &quot;We're looking for wogs carrying gas cannisters.&quot;</p>
<p>Most Paris commuters hurrying to catch trains did not seem to notice the legionnaires, who did not wear their familiar white kepi hats or dress uniforms which the public is used to seeing in the annual Bastille Day march-past.</p>
<p>Legionnaires in the Metro wore the green berets and combat fatigues which are their operational gear. They are generally older, physically fitter and tougher than the young conscripts who have been on Metro duty in the past.</p>
<p>Newspapers said the last time the Legion had done police duty was in the 1956-1957 &quot;Battle of Algiers&quot;, when they used torture to break a bloody nationalist bombing campaign against French neighbourhoods of the North African territory.</p>
<p>The 8,500-strong Legion was long banned from serving in mainland France but some units have been garrisoned here since 1962, when France lost Algeria where it was based.</p>
<p>When the Legion first apppeared in the metro, army officiers insisted their presence was nothing extraordinary although they admitted some people might be critical of foreign mercenary soldiers on police duty in the capital.</p>
<p>Made up of men from about 80 countries, the Legion is famed both for iron discipline on duty as well as for robust behaviour on the battlefield and sometimes on leave.</p>
