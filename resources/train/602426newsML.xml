<p>Tamil Tiger rebels launched a surprise attack on Sri Lankan troops in northern areas freshly captured by the army in the latest offensive launched last week, military officials in the north said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said a large number of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels attacked the army's forward defence lines near Nedunkeni in the northern Wanni region late on Tuesday, but were repulsed.</p>
<p>&quot;A large number of Tigers attacked the army at Othiyamalai, Nedunkeni but were repulsed after the army used heavy weapons to fire at them,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Other officials said one soldier was killed and three wounded in the attack. Rebel casualties were not known.</p>
<p>Troops captured Nedunkeni, about 40 miles (25 km) northeast of Vavuniya, and Omanthai, nine miles (14 km) north of Vavuniya, last week after launching &quot;Operation Jaya Sikuru&quot;, or &quot;Sure of Victory&quot;.</p>
<p>Troops, backed by tanks, artillery and air cover, broke out of Vavuniya, 220 km (135 miles) north of the capital Colombo, in a bid to open a supply route to the Jaffna peninsula further north.</p>
<p>According to official figures given by the Defence Ministry, 67 soldiers have been killed and 96 wounded in the offensive. But hospital sources said some 320 soldiers had been wounded.</p>
<p>The ministry says rebel radio transmissions intercepted by the troops indicate that 181 Tigers have been killed and 316 wounded in the latest fighting. It said the dead included several rebel leaders.</p>
<p>The LTTE have accused the military of killing Tamil civilians and destroying property under the pretext of opening a supply route, and of routinely exaggerating the rebel death toll.</p>
<p>A statement from LTTE's international headquarters in London on Wednesday accused the army of &quot;pursuing a scorched earth policy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The lush farmlands of Omanthai, Puliyankulaman and Nedunkeni are no more. Armoured vehicles and tanks have been deliberately tearing up paddy fields and banana plantations&quot;, the statement said.</p>
<p>The LTTE, fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in mainly Sinhalese Sri Lanka's north and east, control vast swathes of land in the mostly shrub-covered Wanni.</p>
<p>Two army divisions are moving on two separate flanks in what military analysts said was an attempt to cut across the LTTE-held areas to ensure that the rebels are thinly spread on the ground and unable to launch a concerted attack on security forces.</p>
<p>Aid workers said food was running low in the Wanni, where civilians have been displaced by the offensive. They said in Vavuniya that no food convoys had gone north since the army offensive began last Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to rush 200 truckloads of rice, 200 trucks of flour and 50 truckloads of sugar,&quot; said an aid worker.</p>
<p>The military spokesman has denied the food shortage saying enough stocks were sent before the offensive began.</p>
<p>Tamil politicians have appealed to President Chandrika Kumaratunga to stop the offensive.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the strategy of winning peace by military action has failed,&quot; Tamil United Liberation Front president M. Sivasithamparam said in a letter to Kumaratunga.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE say the toll is higher.</p>
