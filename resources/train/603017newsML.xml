<p>Hungary's state privatisation agency APV said on Wednesday it was not planning talks with German utility company Bayernwerk on the sale of Pecs power station despite the company's renewed efforts to buy the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not having any discussion with Bayernwerk and in the near future there won't be any discussions,&quot; APV spokesman Adam Dudits told Reuters.</p>
<p>APV declared unsuccessful in February three tenders for coal-fired plants at Bakony, Pecs and Vertes for which four bids had been received.</p>
<p>On offer were over 61 percent stakes in Bakony and Pecs, each worth over nine billion forints at face value, and an almost 75 percent stake in Vertes, worth 17 billion.</p>
<p>Representatives of Bayernwerk met APV last month to seek clarification over its failed bid to purchase the Pecs plant.</p>
<p>Bayerwerk Director Konrad Kreutzer told Reuters the company had re-submitted its offer for the plant at the meeting and that they were awaiting a response.</p>
<p>&quot;We made a formal bid, we repeated our offer,&quot; Kreutzer said. &quot;The next step is to complete negotiations and we are awaiting some proposals from the APV on how think they will go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>However Dudits said APV was not treating the offer as a new bid.</p>
<p>&quot;The tender is closed, there is no offer on the table,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation now is that APV is not be selling any of the power stations.&quot;</p>
<p>Bayernwerk currently has a 47 percent stake in regional electricity distribution company DEDASZ which serves the area around Pecs. It acquired the stake at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>If Bayernwerk was to acquire Pecs, currently owned by Hungarian state electricity company MVM, it says it would replace the present plant with a new 200 megawatt station which would be cleaner and cheaper to run.</p>
<p>&quot;The existing power plant has to be renewed and a new power plant is a real fact if there is a licence and a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with MVM,&quot; Kreutzer said.</p>
<p>APV was reported to have said the main reason for declaring the original tender unsuccessful was unsatisfactory proposals on the integration of a number of coal mines and their employees, which are included with the plants.</p>
<p>Kreutzer said what happens to the mines can de decided once the PPA is agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;If there is a long-term electricity contract then I think it is possible to do a long-term coal contract and therefore it is just a question of modality whether the buying solution is for the coal or for buying the coal mine,&quot; he said.</p>
