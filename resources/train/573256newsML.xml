<headline>Danish shares becalmed, gains ahead if US advances.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish share prices trickled down on Friday in a desultory market focused on a few key blue chips with dealers foreseeing that prices would hold current levels or rise early next week depending on Wall Street.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been an exceedingly quiet day sandwiched between the Ascension Day holiday and the weekend with many players absent. If the U.S. does well today as it looks like doing, we will probably see rises on Monday,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 0.14 point down at 159.60, while the KFX June future rose 0.10 point to 159.80 with 130 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>SAS recovered a little after a couple of days in the doldrums following a surprise first quarter 1997 loss, closing 2.40 crowns up at 68.50.</p>
<p>Unidanmark basked in big orders, finishing three crowns higher at 339, while Danisco, which was also in focus, only managed to close one crown down at 389.</p>
<p>FLS Industries ended the week 10 crowns up at 1,030.</p>
<p>Overall turnover for the day was 786 million crowns.</p>
