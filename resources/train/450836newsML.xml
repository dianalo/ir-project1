<p>Poor managers and inadequate controls are more likely than dealing losses to cause banks to collapse, a banking industry conference was told on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Bank of England survey of 22 banks which went bankrupt or came close to bankruptcy showed mismanagement in almost all cases, said Patricia Jackson, special adviser on regulatory and supervisory policy to the British central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Only two were involved in dealing losses,&quot; Jackson told a conference on risk management in the banking industry.</p>
<p>Banks worldwide have suffered a number of heavy losses in recent years through failing to spot so-called &quot;rogue traders&quot;.</p>
<p>A committee of G-30 nations drew up recommendations for banks, following the collapse of British bank Barings in 1995 under the weight of unauthorised futures trades by Singapore-based dealer Nick Leeson.</p>
<p>U.S. banks have made progress in meeting those recommendations, but there are areas for improvement, said Sarah Dahlgren, assistant vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p>Processing of trades was &quot;somewhat vulnerable to trader or line manager manipulation,&quot; Dahlgren said.</p>
<p>Banks should also make more attempt to gain independence from traders' expertise when setting up risk control models, she added.</p>
<p>In Britain, NatWest Bank is currently being investigated for losses totalling 90 million pounds due to options mispricing. Five members of staff have been suspended while the investigation is under way.</p>
<p>&quot;Our understanding is that the models were fine, but it was the way in which the models were being used,&quot; said Jackson.</p>
<p>The brunt of responsibility for good controls lies with senior staff, Jackson said.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot as a supervisor be in the bank, day-by-day, hour-by-hour, leaning over the traders' shoulders -- it's quite impossible. Supervisors have to look at how we incentivise senior management to put sufficient controls in place.&quot;</p>
<p>Banks can reduce their capital burden and gain a snapshot of their daily overall profit and loss position by developing sophisticated internal models, central bankers said.</p>
<p>The Bank of England expects to recognise the internal models of around 15 banks for capital adequacy purposes, Jackson said.</p>
<p>Under amendments to the Basle capital accord, banks can use internal models to work out their capital charges, as an alternative to standard capital adequacy calculations.</p>
<p>&quot;There are relatively few players which have all-singing, all-dancing models,&quot; said Jackson.</p>
<p>Banks overall operate under a more rigorous system of checks and controls than companies, and this is a cause for concern, regulators said.</p>
<p>&quot;Corporates are not subject to detailed supervision. They may be free to engage in very risky transactions which then pollute the market,&quot; said Michel Martino, director of the internationl division of Commission Bancaire, the French banking commission.</p>
