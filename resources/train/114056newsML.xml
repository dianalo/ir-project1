<p>Russian natural gas monopoly RAO Gazprom  denied that accounts of its regional subsidiaries had been seized by the government.</p>
<p>&quot;There is and has been no seizure of accounts. All Gazprom structures are continuing to work in a stable way, reliably providing gas for consumers at home and abroad,&quot; Gazprom's press service said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev said in a letter to parliament earlier this month that some of the company's assets had been frozen in an attempt to rake back unpaid taxes.</p>
<p>Gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, acknowledges it owes more than 15 trillion roubles ($2.8 billion) in taxes but says it is owed more than three times that amount by consumers, including the government.</p>
<p>But a Gazprom spokesman said a few days later the assertion that assets had been frozen should not be taken literally but was intended to make consumers pay their gas debts.</p>
<p>The whole Russian economy is mired in a non-payments crisis, in which many companies do not pay their suppliers, their workers or their taxes.</p>
<p>The government, trying to keep within the terms of a $10 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, has declared war on tax dodgers. A powerful presidential commission, headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been set up to spearhead the effort.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom does not have and has not had any conflict with the government. We have worked and will continue to work in maximum cooperation with the government to find a way out of the payments crisis, to resolve the problems of stabilising the socio-economic situation in the country,&quot; Gazprom said in its latest statement.</p>
<p>The confusion over Gazprom's assets has come at an embarrassing time for the company as it prepares an international stock offering.</p>
<p>Lead managers Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson said a week ago the preliminary price for a Gazprom American Depositary Share, each representing 10 ordinary shares, would be between $14 and $16. Gazprom shares opened at $0.30 on the Russian Trading System on Monday.</p>
