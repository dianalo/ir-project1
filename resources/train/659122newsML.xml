<p>Five people were injured at Bogota's El Dorado airport on Friday when a security guard accidentally fired off a blast from his shotgun, authorities said.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred at the main domestic entrance to the terminal building as the guard was speaking on a public telephone while cradling his shotgun in one arm, according to Col. Francisco Bermudez, commander of the airport police.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that it slipped or fell away from him and went off when he grabbed it, wounding five people in their lower extremities,&quot; Bermudez told a local radio station.</p>
<p>He added that the victims were all believed to be Colombian nationals and said one of them was seriously injured.</p>
