<p>China will accelerate efforts to reduce state ownership and give a bigger role to the private sector this year in a campaign that has top-level government support, a senior official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;President Jiang Zemin has said China must have a breakthrough in state ownership structure&quot; in areas not considered vital to state interests, said Ni Di, deputy director of the National Administration of State Property.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the area of breakthrough will be in reorganising state ownership and breathing new life into the state sector,&quot; he told a conference on state assets.</p>
<p>Ni said state control was no longer seen as vital in areas such as export processing, trade, retail business and some local infrastructure projects, and these areas were likely to see an expanded role for private and collective interests.</p>
<p>China has long debated the role of the state in its economy, once dominated by government ownership and Stalinist central planning. Support for ownership reform has shifted along with prevailing political winds.</p>
<p>Efforts to expand privatisation were dealt a setback by the ousting of reformists led by former Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang in 1989 and the subsequent crackdown on political dissent following the Tiananmen Square protests.</p>
<p>However, mounting losses in the inefficient state sector have given new impetus to a drive to expand the private sector.</p>
<p>In his speech, Ni also avoided using the politically sensitive term &quot;privatisation&quot;, but the implication was clear that the state was willing to loosen its grip on the economy.</p>
<p>China has already said it would sharply expand the number of state companies allowed to issue stock on the nation's share markets this year, a move that would effectively expand private participation in state industry.</p>
<p>More shares held by the state directly and through state institutions with so-called &quot;legal person shares&quot; should be made available to the public to make it harder to manipulate the market, Zhang Jixiang, another official of the National Administration of State Property, told the conference.</p>
<p>&quot;If legal person and state shares are not made liquid it will restrict the market,&quot; said Zhang, who is director of the administration's Assets Appraisal Administration Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;In many cases, most of the shares are off the market. This leads to speculation&quot; of the listed shares, he said.</p>
<p>Legal person shares were created to inject funds into cash-strapped state companies while retaining state control by turning ownership over to cash-rich state institutions.</p>
<p>Efforts to expand private sector participation would limit the investment risk for the state, Ni said.</p>
<p>China's economic policy makers have been pushing to control risk, particularly following the collapse of big state trust company China Agribusiness Development Trust and Investment Corp early this year.</p>
