<p>Egyptian share prices crept up to a new 17-month high on Thursday in a very active market, partly due to registration of newly privatised firms, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index closed 0.01 points up at 234.99, the highest since early April 1995. in turnover of 114.20 million pounds ($33.59 million).</p>
<p>&quot;The volume was very high. This is not only because of new flotations,&quot;  Hermes Financial vice president Ahmed el-Helw told Reuters. &quot;It was distributed between a big number of shares.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares worth 18.00 million pounds in recently floated West and Central Delta Flour Mills were registered.</p>
<p>Another 63.54 million pounds worth of shares in Development and Popular Houses were also registered.</p>
<p>The market leader in traded shares was North Cairo Flour Mills, which rose 1.50 pounds to finish at 96.50 pounds. Shares worth 4.79 million pounds were traded.</p>
<p>&quot;The milling sector is performing quiet well after the state sold 65 percent of West and Central Delta. People now hope that most of the government's major stakes in other millers will be sold,&quot; broker Youssef Khalil of Delta EAB said.</p>
<p>The government had said it would not sell more than 40 percent of miller firms, regarding it as a strategic industry.</p>
<p>Central Egypt Flour Mills rose 0.20 pounds to close at 26.05 pounds after shares worth 1.55 million pounds changing hands.</p>
<p>Kafr el-Zayat Pesticides and Chemicals continued its increase rising 0.51 pounds to finish at 48.51 pounds. Shares in the company were 100 times oversubscibed in a recent flotation.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms rose to 345.26 points from 344.07 on Wednesday and the index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms went up to 160.72 points from 160.71.</p>
