<headline>Two Koreas argue over means to transfer food aid.</headline>

<p>Officials of the Red Cross Societies of South Korea and its rival North held a second day of talks on aid on Thursday, wrangling over how to transport the food to the hungry North, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks are going very smoothly,&quot; South Korean embassy spokesman Chang Moon Ik told reporters after a morning session.</p>
<p>The amount of aid, in the form of 50,000 tonnes of corn and rice from South Korea, had been decided despite a request from the North Korean side when the talks opened on Wednesday that the amount be increased, said a source close to the talks.</p>
<p>A one-on-one session would be held in the afternoon, Lee Byoung-woong, secretary general of the South Korean Red Cross Society, told reporters.</p>
<p>Discussion was expected to focus on methods to transfer the grain to the North, which is on the brink of famine after floods destroyed much of its harvest in 1995 and 1996, the source close to the talks said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the South voiced concern that previous food shipments may not have reached intended beneficiaries and proposed that future aid be sent via Panmunjom, the only border crossing between the two Koreas since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an uneasy armistice.</p>
<p>North Korea is reluctant to use the land crossing at Panmunjon and has previously insisted the aid be sent by sea.</p>
<p>&quot;Some items on the agenda have not been decided,&quot; the embassy's Chang said, adding that he expected an agreement either later on Thursday or on Friday.</p>
<p>He refused to give details of which issues were holding up final agreement.</p>
<p>Southern officials have said the package of about 50,000 tonnes of rice and corn, similar to an amount agreed last May, would be available for delivery to the North by the end of October. The first shipment is due to be completed later this month.</p>
<p>They said the South was unable to meet the request from the North for a larger amount because the southern Red Cross had to rely on private donations.</p>
<p>International aid workers say the communist North is on the brink of famine after floods in 1995 and 1996 devastated much of the country's farmland and industrial bases, exacerbating already severe food shortages.</p>
<p>Pyongyang says severe drought is threatening to do even more damage to its agricultural sector this year.</p>
<p>In previous talks, Seoul had demanded the aid be clearly labelled as coming from South Korea and tried to win guarantees the humanitarian aid would not fall into the hands of Pyongyang's military.</p>
<p>The aid agreed last May came on top of $16 million worth of donations made by Seoul in response to an appeal by the United Nations World Food Programme.</p>
<p>Washington also this month nearly doubled its total food aid to North Korea to $52 million, intended to combat widespread malnutrition, particularly among children.</p>
