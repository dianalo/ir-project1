<p>South African deputy president Thabo Mbeki on Thursday sought to soothe overseas investor nerves about political instability and crime in South Africa.</p>
<p>Mbeki said the first full democratic poll in 1994 and this year's successful provincial elections in the violence-wracked province of KwaZulu-Natal showed fears over political instability were exaggerated.</p>
<p>&quot;Democratic organs (of state) are functioning well...this is what really addresses the matter of political stability in the country,&quot; he told the Southern Africa Trade and Investment Summit being held in Harare.</p>
<p>Mbeki, who is the designated successor to president Nelson Mandela, said South Africans as a whole were happy with the consensus built in the 2-1/2 years since the first all-race elections.</p>
<p>&quot;For South Africans generally I don't think there are many fears about what might happen in the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The summit has brought together political and business leaders from all over southern Africa in order to try and boost regional trade and woo foreign investment.</p>
<p>One of the main fears that has discouraged foreign firms from investing in South Africa is a violent crime wave that has gripped the nation's cities, especially Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Mbeki said the problem was a hangover from apartheid days and a product of a police force geared to combating opponents of apartheid and now being faced with fighting crime.</p>
<p>Mbeki said the criminal justice system and law enforcement agencies had to be strengthened and the relationship between the police and the community must improve.</p>
<p>&quot;If we improve the performance of the police we also create the conditions for the community to gain confidence in the police,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Corruption in the police had to be rooted out. &quot;In reality the community knows the identity of the criminals, but are reluctant to report them to the police as they believe themselves that the police are involved in crime,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
