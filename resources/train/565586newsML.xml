<headline>NZ SPORT - Chiefs unchanged for ACT game.</headline>
<text>
<p>HAMILTON, May 7 - Never change a winning team. That old adage has been adopted by Waikato Chiefs Super 12 rugby coach Brad Meurant despite the return to fitness of some of his injured players, NZPA reports.</p>
<p>Meurant on Wednesday named the same line-up that hammered Gauteng Lions 47-9 in Hamilton last Saturday night for this Friday night's clash with the third-placed ACT Brumbies in Canberra.  </p>
<p>Both winger Eric Rush, whose bronchial condition and subsequent treatment with a restricted drug kept him out of last weekend's match, and halfback Mark Robinson, who has recovered from an ankle injury, have recovered sufficiently to take their place on the reserves bench.</p>
<p>Openside flanker Dean Anglesey was also clearly over his neck injury when the Chiefs trained at Albany this morning but Meurant said it was a relatively easy decision not to change the playing 15 for the Brumbies match.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you were a player involved in that win on Saturday night you'd be very disappointed if you were left out after everything we've been through,&quot; Meurant said.</p>
<p>Only 21 players are being taken to Canberra tomorrow and Meurant said Anglesey's absence was because he (Meurant) wasn't prepared to change an in-form loose forward trio and with a six-man reserve bench it was not practical to carry a specialist openside flanker across the Tasman.  </p>
<p>In addition to second five-eighths Walter Little, who has ruled himself out of all rugby for six weeks while he strengthens the muscles around the damaged anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, centre Frank Bunce, wing Glen Osborne and lock Blair Larsen weren't considered because of injury.</p>
<p>Larsen has missed most of the Super 12 with a stress fracture in his leg while Bunce was &quot;still a week or two away&quot; from fitness after straining and slightly tearing the plantar fascia tendon on the sole of his foot.  </p>
<p>&quot;He's not right and we don't want to rush him and ruin his chances of All Blacks selection when we're not playing to win a top four spot any more,&quot; Meurant said.</p>
<p>Osborne still needs to rest his medial knee ligament injury and bruised calf and would be reassessed next week.</p>
<p>Meurant was more than pleased with the training runs last night and this morning, and decided not to have a further session this afternoon. The team will probably have a light run and stretch when they get to Canberra tomorrow.  </p>
<p>But he was wary of the step up his young team would have to make to take on an ACT team, who are unbeaten at Bruce Stadium in two years and have fielded an unchanged side for the past four games.</p>
<p>&quot;Gauteng was a very average side. The boys played very well and didn't allow them to get into the game, but the ACT side are a very different kettle of fish and are playing very well,&quot; Meurant said.  </p>
<p>Waikato Chiefs: Matt Cooper, Bruce Reihana, Pita Alatini, Caleb Ralph, Scott McLeod, Ian Foster, Rhys Duggan, Deon Muir, Brett Sinkinson, Glenn Taylor, Ian Jones (captain), Aaron Hopa, Richard Loe, Greg Smith, Michael Collins. Reserves: Blair Feeney, Mark Robinson, Eric Rush, Paul Mitchell, Lee Lidgard, Richard Coventry.</p>
<p>ACT Brumbies: Stephen Larkham, Mitch Hardy, James Holbeck, Joe Roff, Pat Howard, David Knox, George Gregan, Troy Coker, Brett Robinson (captain), David Giffin, John Langford, Owen Finegan, Ewen McKenzie, Marco Caputo, Patricio Noriega.</p>
