<title>UK: FOCUS - White metals, nickel up on Russia strike fear.</title>
<headline>FOCUS - White metals, nickel up on Russia strike fear.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prices of the rare precious metals platinum and palladium, and of nickel, soared on Thursday on fears that labour unrest in Russia might tighten supply.</p>
<p>Platinum shot up by $10.00 at the morning fixing to $393.50 per ounce, the highest since September 1996, after workers at the huge Norilsk complex threatened to strike on March 15.</p>
<p>Its sister metal palladium jumped $7.00 to fix at $157.00, last seen in July 1995.</p>
<p>Each metal has gained over $40 since they bottomed out from declines over the past few months.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure has been building for some time but the strike news was the last straw,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Russia is the biggest producer of palladium and the second largest of platinum, mainly used in electronics and auto catalysts to clean up exhaust fumes.</p>
<p>Japan is by far the largest consumer and the market was already jittery earlier in the year when Tokyo's annual contract talks with Russia were delayed, raising the spectre of late shipments.</p>
<p>Gold was swept along too to reach its highest fixing since January 3 this year at $360.00.</p>
<p>The industrial metals sector also performed strongly, surging to fresh highs, extending Wednesday's gains, which were also initially set in train by the news from Norilsk.</p>
<p>Nickel and copper scored fresh nine-month peaks of $8,180 and $2,412 per tonne respectively on the London Metal Exchange, although they closed off their highs.</p>
<p>Aluminium, however, retreated from fresh highs touched on Wednesday, sliding $13 to $1,652 per tonne by the afternoon kerb close.</p>
<p>Traders were generally bullish in the near term although the market mood remained wary after Wednesday's sharp, fund-led rally cut short an anticipated downward correction. &quot;The market is trying to absorb what happened on Wednesday  -- figure out what's behind the move and why,&quot; a trader said, adding that Chinese buying on Wednesday morning may have given the market a boost.</p>
<p>Coffee made an about-turn on profit-taking. London's benchmark May robusta contract rose to a high of $1,635 per tonne in the morning, but finished $5 lower at $1,575.</p>
<p>Cocoa extended gains, taking their cue from a rebound in New York and shrugging off data from Ghana showing cocoa purchases rose in the 17th week to 8,687 tonnes from 6,229 tonnes in the same week last season.</p>
<p>The May contract ended $7 higher at $893 per tonne.</p>
<p>Sugar rose slightly, with May 70 cents firmer at $306.90 per tonne in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>In Chicago, wheat futures were stronger at midsession as investment funds waded into the market, targeting new crop July, traders said.</p>
<p>Key fund trader Smith Barney bought 2.5 million bushels of July at the opening and up to five million by mid-morning, they added.</p>
<p>Wheat was 3/4 to seven cents per bushel firmer with bellwether March up 1-1/4 cents at $3.72 per bushel.</p>
