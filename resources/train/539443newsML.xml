<title>USA: EDS stock plummets after weak Q1 report.</title>
<headline>EDS stock plummets after weak Q1 report.</headline>
<dateline>DALLAS 1997-04-25</dateline>
<text>
<p>Electronic Data Systems Corp's share price dropped more than 20 percent early Friday as investors reacted to first quarter earnings that came in sharply below Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>Industry analysts rushed to cut their 1997 earnings estimates and stock recommendations on EDS after the computer services giant, in a statement late Thursday, reported an 11 percent drop in first quarter earnings.</p>
<p>EDS shares were down 9-1/2 to 32-1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>&quot;This was a shortfall of historic proportions and it was not pre-announced,&quot; Cowen &amp; Co analyst Hugh Shytle said. &quot;That is why people are selling now with both hands.&quot;</p>
<p>EDS said its first quarter net income was $194.1 million, or $0.40 per share, down from $218.8 million, or $0.45 per share, a year earlier. The earnings per share fell short of analysts' estimates by $0.08.</p>
<p>Operating revenues rose 6.7 percent -- less than the company had projected -- to $3.592 billion from $3.367 billion.  </p>
<p>EDS blamed rapidly rising labor costs and said it was starting a cost-cutting reorganization that would target 7,000 to 9,000 jobs for elimination or transfer.</p>
<p>It said the second quarter would also be weaker than expected but pointed to strong new contract signings and predicted strong revenue growth in the second half.</p>
<p>Anaylsts said the cost problem went beyond labor and pointed to high sales, marketing and infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>EDS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Les Alberthal told  analysts that EDS would still meet market expectations of 1997 earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.35.  </p>
<p>Some analysts sounded unconvinced.</p>
<p>&quot;Can they really get that much cost expense in the second half of the year, and if they do, will it disrupt the revenue stream?&quot; said Gery Helmig, an analyst with Soundview Financial Group who dropped his 1997 estimate to $2.25 a share from $2.32.</p>
<p>Helmig said EDS was taking steps in the right direction to cut costs but added that the company's much-touted history of steady earnings growth was now in question.</p>
<p>&quot;They were the kind of company for grandmother to put money into, but now it has gone the other way: their backlog eroding, gross margins eroding and earnings per share eroding,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they can do it, but they certainly haven't done it yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The first signs of trouble at EDS came last year as revenue growth and new contracts began to fade. Experts said the company had been distracted by the long negotiations that led to EDS splitting off from General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>Some analysts say they have seen some bright spots in recent months, notably a pickup in new business.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing is that they are back out in the street and selling,&quot; said Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research.</p>
