<title>USA: CBOT corn ends up on fund buying, soybean surge.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn ends up on fund buying, soybean surge.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-20</dateline>

<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on another wave of fund buying plus an impressive rebound in the soy complex, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fund driven and it acts super. As long as funds keep buying we keep going up,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter.</p>
<p>Funds bought an estimated 50 million to 60 million bushels of corn Thursday which brought the weekly tally to roughly one quarter of a billion bushels.</p>
<p>&quot;Funds have bought 250 million or more corn this week and how much more they buy remains to be seen,&quot; a trader said. &quot;Just remember last year funds got long 700 million.&quot;</p>
<p>But &quot;corn is finding selling and that's why corn did not explode today,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Corn found support from soymeal and from the rally in soybeans to one half the daily limit in the nearby contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;It's tight in meal and meal and corn are key feed components so as meal goes so goes corn,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>A contract high of $260.00 per ton was set Thursday in March soymeal, above the previous high of $258.00 which was notched on September 11.</p>
<p>Corn closed 3-1/2 to six cents per bushel higher, with March up 3-1/2 at $2.87.  </p>
<p>In the background was dry weather in South Africa which led to optimism for export sales to that region and traders took note of a jump Thursday in the volume of spreading.</p>
<p>Cargill Investor Services spread five million May/March, Farmers Commodities Corp did 3.5 million bushels of March/May and Tenco Inc did four million December/July, traders said.</p>
<p>Griffin Trading spread 3.5 million bushels of July/March, sources also said.</p>
<p>Friday, February 28 is first notice day for deliveries on the March contract and sources said key commercials and funds were starting to spread out of the March contract.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 110,000 contracts, below the 159,773 traded Wednesday.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 37,000 contracts, below the 45,720 traded Wednesday.</p>
