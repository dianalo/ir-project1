<p>Vietnam, facing widespread loan problems in its domestic banking system, on Wednesday released a list of banking topics which it said were barred or restricted from media coverage under state secrecy laws.</p>
<p>The restrictions were necessary to maintain the reputation and prestige of Vietnam's economy and banking system, the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>The government also dsistributed to media a list of procedures which news organisations were required to follow when covering banking matters.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the regulations applied to foreign media. Vietnam's domestic media operates under strict state controls, but foreign journalists have more freedom.</p>
<p>Included among the list of topics ruled off-limits were documents containing information about promotions or disciplinary actions against banking executives and officials which had not been cleared for publication.</p>
<p>The work of government banking authorities, personnel files on key banking officials, and complaints that were under investigation but had not been authorised for media release were also included.</p>
<p>The decision to restrict media coverage comes ahead of a spring session of Vietnam's National Assembly due next month which will discuss details of a draft banking law.</p>
<p>Details of widespread loans problems in Vietnam's national banking system resulting from failed property speculation by local firms have emerged recently in both the foreign and domestic media.</p>
<p>Industry executives say the firms involved used influence and connections to secure huge multiple loans from both private and state-owned commercial banks, usually in the form of letters of credit (LC).</p>
<p>A downturn in the property market since 1995 has left these companies unable to repay debts to banks, which in turn are delaying repayments on LC's because collateral on loans had been taken in the form of fixed real estate assets. Such assets are often difficult to recover.</p>
<p>Earlier this week police in Ho Chi Minh City arrested two prominent business executives, including the head of southern garment producer Minh Phung, identified by state banking officials as having been involved in the speculation.</p>
