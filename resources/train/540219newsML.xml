<headline>Turkish PM, deputy meet in Islamist row.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-04-25</dateline>

<p>Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan met his coalition partner Tansu Ciller on Friday afternoon amid a row over religious activism that has threatened the future of the government.</p>
<p>The pair met at 3.40 p.m. (1240 GMT) at the prime minister's office. They made no comments as they entered the meeting.  </p>
<p>Before meeting Ciller, Erbakan held talks with the General Secretary of the National Security Council (MGK). The powerful government-military body ordered a crackdown against Islamist zeal in a meeting in February, raising Islamist-secularist tension and sparked speculation of a government collapse.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Ciller earlier denied a press report that she would pull her True Path Party (DYP) out of the alliance with Erbakan.</p>
<p>The Yeni Yuzyil daily quoted unnamed cabinet ministers as saying Ciller, also the foreign minister, planned to withdraw the DYP from the 10-month-old government over a growing dispute between the Islamists and the army.</p>
<p>Members of Ciller's conservative wing are concerned at the failure of Erbakan, the country's first Islamist leader, to implement the army demands. Erbakan will face the generals at a meeting of the National Security Council on Saturday that has been billed as a showdown.</p>
