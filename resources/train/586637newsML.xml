<p>Faster consolidation in the agricultural chemicals industry can be expected following two major drugmakers' exits from the business in as many days.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly and Co said Thursday it agreed to sell its 40-percent stake in Dow Elanco to Dow Chemical Co for $1.2 billion. Dow Elanco, an eight-year-old joint venture between the two firms, will become solely owned by Dow.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Merck &amp; Co Inc said it agreed to sell its agricultural chemicals business to Novartis AG for $910 million.  </p>
<p>&quot;This takes two more drug companies out of the crop chemicals business ... We would expect to see more consolidation,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst James Wilbur.</p>
<p>Other major drugmakers that may be looking to get off the farm are Rhone-Poulenc SA, Hoechst AG and Zeneca Group Plc, analysts said.</p>
<p>A Rhone-Poulenc spokesman said the company is satisfied with its present organization. A Zeneca spokeswoman said the company values its ag chem business as part of its broad base in bioscience and declined to comment on speculation.</p>
<p>Hoechst could not immediately be reached for comment.  </p>
<p>Analysts also said smaller chemicals firms, such as FMC Corp and Rohm &amp; Haas Co, could be affected.</p>
<p>An FMC spokesman said the company's policy is not to comment on market speculation. A Rohm &amp; Haas spokesman said the company's ag chem business is strong and an important part of its strategic portfolio for the future.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts called the close timing of the Lilly and Merck deals a coincidence, but added they do signal a quickening of mergers and acquisitions in the field.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a rapidly consolidating business,&quot; said Prudential Securities chemicals analyst Glenn Mierendorf.</p>
<p>Drugmakers for years did research so broad that they often stumbled on chemical compounds valuable to farming, if not to medicine. Those discoveries are becoming rarer, however, as research gets more focused.</p>
<p>At the same time, advances in biotechnology and crop genetics are pressuring traditional crop chemicals' profits, making drug firms all the more eager to get out of ag chem.</p>
<p>&quot;You have two companies in Merck and Lilly that have vibrant, higher-margin pharmaceuticals businesses and ag-chem is a distraction,&quot; Cowen &amp; Co analyst Stephen Scala said.</p>
