<p>Europe's big three bourses chalked up new record closes on Monday after Wall Street extended last week's gains, but the dollar lost momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street has been giving us a helping hand and as long as it holds up there's no reason why we won't keep going higher,&quot; one dealer in London said.</p>
<p>Wall Street's Dow Jones index of leading shares, which rose 56 points on Friday, was up around 24 points at 7,024.75 shortly after European bourse trade ended with London, Paris and Frankfurt all at record closes.</p>
<p>Equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic were encouraged by the U.S. jobs report for February which on Friday showed little upward pressure on wages, despite a bigger-than-expected rise in the number of new jobs created.</p>
<p>Economists and traders concluded that the jobs report had not given the U.S. Federal Reserve cause to raise interest rates soon to check the threat of inflation.</p>
<p>Any rise in rates could sorely test the global bull market in shares which has pushed valuations to record after record recently since higher rates harm companies profitability by raising the cost of borrowing and also make alternative investments more attractive.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 share index ended at a record closing high for the fifth session in a row as continued strength on Wall Street and a more relaxed peception of the British inflation outlook boosted shares.</p>
<p>Dealers said the domestic economic picture for the FTSE remained bullish and the market could scale even loftier peaks as long as Wall Street maintained its firm tone.</p>
<p>The FTSE hit an all-time record of 4,440.8 in morning trade and ended at 4,437.4, 17.1 points firmer.</p>
<p>Earlier Bank of England Governor Eddie George said he believed the government could reach its 2.5 percent inflation target this year.</p>
<p>&quot;He raised the question about whether it could be sustained, but up until now, he didn't even think it was a target that could be reached,&quot; one London share dealer said of George's forecast. &quot;I think the chance of an early rate increase has receded quite significantly.&quot;</p>
<p>British February producer price inflation was in line with expectations at 1.3 percent and one analyst said the data showed inflation was &quot;very tame at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Paris shares scraped to a fourth consecutive record close, rising just 0.93 of a point to 2,709.21, well below their session highs. Traders said foreign funds were entering the market, offsetting some profit-taking on the market's gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners have lots of cash that they want to invest. It's a state of mind. The French are staying out of it,&quot; a Paris share trader said.</p>
<p>Germany's blue-chip DAX index ended bourse trade at a new closing high with sentiment lifted by Friday's strong close on Wall Street above 7,000 points, firmer bunds and a stable, if lower, dollar.</p>
<p>At the end of the floor-trade session the DAX index stood at 3,436.07 points, up 59.87 points or 1.77 percent, an all-time closing high for the index.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar was lower, weakened by profit-taking after its brief rise above 1.72 marks last week, and covering of mark shorts, traders said.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of a firmer mark the dollar slipped close to 1.70 marks after erosion of support at 1.7050 triggered stop-loss selling.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen somewhat of a recovery in the mark in the past few days and that is continuing gently,&quot; said Paul Crowhurst, a trader at Bank of Boston in London. &quot;The dollar is still consolidating because it had come a long way quite quickly but the retracement is not very large.&quot;</p>
<p>In late trade, the dollar was at 1.7029 marks and 121.73 yen, down from 1.7182 and 121.94 in late Europe on Friday.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen weakened in line with dollar/mark but a rise in the mark/yen cross supported the U.S. unit against the yen.</p>
<p>Unwinding of long dollar positions after last Friday's non-farm payrolls capped the dollar's rise, traders said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1630 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.7029 marks and 121.65 yen compared with 1.7182 marks and 121.94 yen in late European trade on Friday.</p>
