<p>Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila reported more battlefield victories on Saturday after rejecting international mediation in the conflict with ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Kabila told Reuters there was fighting in Punia, about 70 km (45 miles) south of Lubutu, and that his forces entered the town early on Friday.</p>
<p>Defence officials in Kinshasa admitted late on Friday that Punia, which guards the road to the key government-held city of Kisangani, was in danger of falling.</p>
<p>Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) has steadily eroded Mobutu's control in eastern Zaire since the rebellion began last October. The Alliance now claims to control a narrow border strip about 1,400 km (875 miles) long.</p>
<p>Mobutu returned home on Friday after medical tests for his prostate cancer in Europe and a three-day working visit to Morocco, a longtime ally.</p>
<p>Leaving after talks with King Hassan, Mobutu denied he had asked for Moroccan troops and military material to combat the rebels, accused by Zaire of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
<p>But Kabila claimed to know Hassan had turned down Mobutu's request for troops and thanked the Moroccan monarch.</p>
<p>&quot;Our information is accurate and it indicates that Mobutu got nothing out of King Hassan. The King politely refused to send troops to Zaire but instead gave Mobutu confusing promises to supply him with some equipment,&quot; Kabila added on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kabila, who believes the end of Mobutu's 32-year rule is approaching, on Friday rejected international mediation to end Africa's latest war.</p>
<p>He said the war was an internal matter that must be resolved by the Zaireans.</p>
<p>He was responding to calls from several African nations for international mediation in the war sparked off by Zairean attempts to expel the Banyamulenge -- an ethnic Tutsi group -- back to Rwanda, a land they left up to 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The Banyamulenge took up arms to resist the expulsions and joined Kabila, a veteran opposition figure against Mobutu.</p>
<p>Kabila said he was only willing to meet Mobutu on a one-to-one basis to discuss Mobutu's handover of power.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council in New York expressed grave concern on Friday over the deteriorating situation in Central Africa and warned states to stay out of Zaire's civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not at all interested in the internationalisation of the Zairean conflict. There is no need for international or regional mediation in our conflict,&quot; Kabila said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu must come and talk to us on how to hand over power, otherwise we shall continue with the military campaign and remove him.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday the rebel leader said his forces were also besieging the airfield and army base at Kindu, one of two bases for Kinshasa's counter-offensive, saying his forces expected to take Kindu in the next few days.</p>
<p>Kabila said his forces continued to advance on several fronts and had captured the refugee camp of Amisi outside the town of Lubutu, gateway to Kisangani.</p>
<p>He reported advances in the north around the town of Isiro near the Sudan-Uganda border, and in the south on the town of Moba, a potential launchpad to attack government forces defending mineral-rich Shaba province.</p>
<p>Kabila dismissed reports of government troops recapturing Shabunda and Watsa as &quot;reckless propaganda by the government in Kinshasa&quot;.</p>
