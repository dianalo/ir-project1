<p>Vietnam's biggest drugs scandal was set to reach its climax on Wednesday as a Hanoi court prepared to send security officials, border guards and other members of a trafficking ring either to jail or the firing squad.</p>
<p>Newspapers were packed with last-minute details of the two-week courtroom drama, whose central figures have become household names, and even the father of key defendant Vu Xuan Truong said his son deserved to die.</p>
<p>The trial of the 22 people, half of them former police and border security officials, is the biggest drugs scandal yet to surface in communist Vietnam.</p>
<p>The judges, whose 100-page verdict was due to be delivered late on Wednesday, were expected to follow a prosecution recommendation calling for eight people to be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>However, sources at the court said leniency might be shown towards two women who maintained their innocence throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p>Eight of the 14 others are expected to face life imprisonment, with the rest set for terms of up to 20 years.</p>
<p>Truong, a former captain in the Interior Ministry's anti-crime unit, has already accepted that he will die.</p>
<p>He has tried to commit suicide twice, first by dashing his head against the wall of his prison-cell wall and then by butting the corner of a water cistern, and has taken to wearing a white headband to mourn his own coming death.</p>
<p>Truong's father, Vu Van Vuong, told the Lao Dong newspaper that his son deserved to die. But he called for law to deal humanely with Truong's co-defendant wife and brother.</p>
<p>The drugs syndicate is believed to have flooded the country with an estimated 300 kg (660 pounds) of heroin from remote corners of Thailand, Laos and Burma over several years.</p>
<p>Drug experts say Vietnam has become a major transit route for narcotics from the notorious Golden Triangle since its borders, long closed to the outside world, were opened in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Huge amounts of heroin have been shipped to destinations such as Australia, the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, often under the eye of corrupt officials.</p>
<p>Much has also stayed in Vietnam, where a decades-old habit of smoking opium is rapidly being replaced by addiction to heroin, even among children.</p>
<p>The daily Vietnam News said on Wednesday that boxes for anonymous letters, posted at schools around the capital, had helped identify pushers, selling points and drug users.</p>
<p>&quot;...Through the system, 173 students were denounced as being addicted to drugs, 81 drug-dealing points adjacent to schools were named, and three touts who urged students to use drugs were identified,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said on Wednesday it would provide about $500,000 for a project to study the use of an anti-addiction herbal medication called HEANTOS.</p>
<p>While efforts may be under way to help addicts, little sympathy has been spared from either the government or the public at large for the trial's defendants.</p>
<p>&quot;With Vu Xuan Truong people feel angry, but also sickened and disgusted,&quot; a man in the street told the Tuoi Tre newspaper. &quot;With every cent that he put in his pocket, someone lost a life.&quot;</p>
