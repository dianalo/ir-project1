<p>Japan will soon adopt stiff penalties against groups which try to smuggle illegal immigrants into the country, Justice Minister Isao Matsuura said on Friday.</p>
<p>Matsuura said his ministry planned to submit a revision to the Immigration Control Law during the current session of parliament, which ends in June.</p>
<p>His plan was approved at Friday's cabinet meeting, Justice Ministry officials said.</p>
<p>Talk of the revision follows a sudden rise in the number of illegal immigrants, mostly Chinese, caught trying to land in Japan through immigrant smuggling rings, run by so-called snakeheads.</p>
<p>They are often referred to as &quot;snakeheads&quot; because of their reputation for viciousness.</p>
<p>In the past two months, 581 Chinese nationals have been caught, compared to 545 for the whole of last year.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many organisations which conduct businesses in smuggling illegal immigrants into the country,&quot; Matsuura told the cabinet meeting. &quot;These groups are making huge money and current penalties are too light.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the current Immigration Control Law, the maximum penalty for illegal immigrants is a three-year prison term and a fine of less than 300,000 yen ($2,500).</p>
<p>The current law does not stipulate a separate penalty for those who carry out smuggling operations, and under the broader Penal Code, the maximum penalty for such accomplices is half that of the convicted, would-be immigrant.</p>
<p>Justice Ministry officials said the revised law would aim to impose stiffer penalties on smugglers compared to convicted illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, police arrested seven suspected members of a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring.</p>
<p>The seven were arrested along with 10 others on suspicion of violating immigration laws for smuggling 70 Chinese into Japan, where long, sparsely populated coasts and high wages have drawn record numbers of Chinese this year, police said.</p>
<p>Investigations and testimony by the apprehended immigrants reveal an increasingly sophisticated Chinese smuggling network inside Japan, the nation's top police official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The snakehead broker groups have made inroads in Japan and are increasingly active here,&quot; Takaji Kunimatsu, chief of the National Police Agency, told a news conference. &quot;We are proceeding to uncover more about their organisation.&quot;</p>
<p>The network uses fake travel documents and employs a fleet of small boats with modern navigation equipment to evade maritime patrols, police said.</p>
<p>They lure people from Fujian province and other densely populated coastal Chinese provinces with the promise of high-paying factory jobs, typically charging three million yen ($25,000) for the passage, would-be immigrants have said.</p>
<p>The arrest this week of the Japan-based snakeheads suggests that the Chinese smugglers are bypassing Japanese gangsters to set up routes between China and Japan, officials said. ($1 = 120.6 yen)</p>
