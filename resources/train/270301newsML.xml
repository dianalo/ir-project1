<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed up for a third day in a row, based mainly on anticipation of good times next year, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Colombo Stock Exchange all share index closed 4.6 points up at 597, up for a third day after falling steadily for the past week.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is expecting the market to move up in January,&quot; said Dihan Dedigama, manager at John Keells Stock Brokers.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's activity may have been in anticipation of that movement,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Turnover, supported by 200,000 shares of Sampath Bank (up 1.75 to 45.75), 448,800 Three Acre Farms (up 8 rupees to 45) and 100,000 Grain Elevators at 11.50, was 36.1 million rupees.</p>
<p>Gains outnumbered losses 31 to nine and prices for 19 stocks traded remained unchanged. Foreign sales amounted to 5.7 million rupees, but foreign buying was worth only 393,000 rupees.</p>
<p>Some of today's activity was generated by companies which are ending their financial year in December, booking short term gain to show profit, said another broker.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign buying was also there, but on fundamentally strong stock only,&quot; he said. --Mohan Samarasinghe (941) 434319</p>
