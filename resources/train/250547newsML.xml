<p>Plans for European Union leaders to endorse a blueprint for rural development in Dublin this week are likely to be shelved due to growing opposition from farmers and doubts in Germany and other member states, EU sources said.</p>
<p>The blueprint, brainchild of EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler's rural development conference in Cork, Ireland, last month, called for radical reforms to prepare for the next round of world farm subsidy cuts and the EU's expansion east.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unlikely to be approved by the summit. More discussion is needed. It's too important to be rushed,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Around a quarter of EU citizens live in rural areas, ranging from the olive groves of southern Italy to the tundra of northern Finland, covering 80 percent of EU territory.</p>
<p>The EU's powerful farmers' organisation, COPA, is angry that the blueprint would drain farm aid into the promotion of tourism, crafts and other rural economic activities.</p>
<p>&quot;We should not mix up agricultural and rural policy,&quot; Dominique Souchon, COPA's director of strategy, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Rural development must not take money from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Extra funds are needed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A Fischler aide denied any such intention.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no intention of replacing the CAP with a common rural development policy,&quot; the aide told Reuters.</p>
<p>But recent farm reforms will be deepened in order to prepare for new world farm negotiations starting in 1999 and entry into the EU of former east European communist countries, he added.</p>
<p>In Cork, Fischler called for greater cohesion and efficiency of EU rural development programmes on which some 30 billion Ecus ($37 billion) is being spent over the five years to 1999.</p>
<p>Fischler noted there were over 400 EU rural schemes, which had sprung up independently and operated with different rules.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not surprising that this has given rise to incoherencies, contradictions, overlapping and even conflict,&quot; he said, adding there was a need for radical simplification.</p>
<p>COPA, which represents some eight million farmers, is concerned by the Cork declaration's call for a further shift in price support towards direct income aid because it fears that payments will no longer be automatic and could be cut.</p>
<p>Many EU farm ministers, led by Germany, are also concerned that farm funds may be switched into rural development.</p>
<p>&quot;There's already a lot of money going into rural regions. It needs to be spent more efficiently,&quot; a German official said.</p>
<p>France, which was concerned that farmers were not adequately represented at the Cork meeting, stressed along with other countries the need to safeguard the CAP.</p>
<p>Only Britain, Sweden and Finland have shown enthusiasm for integrating rural and agricultural aid policies.</p>
<p>Ireland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, said it was still considering what to do with the blueprint.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not clear whether it will feature in the summit's conclusions,&quot; an Irish EU Presidency spokesman said.</p>
