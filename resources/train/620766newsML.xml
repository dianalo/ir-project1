<headline>Madrid stocks drop sharply as upward streak ends.</headline>
<text>
<p>MADRID, May 28 (Reuter) 1515 GMT - Madrid's bourse closed sharply lower on Wednesday as dealers lost their nerve after a stretch of spectacular, record-breaking gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>The downward twist of other European markets, particularly Paris, on French election woes gave the market an excuse to take some profits and a breather after the upward streak.</p>
<p>The general index down 12.90 points, 2.23 percent, to 564.86 and the Ibex-35 fell 153.0 points, 2.3 percent, to 6,522.25.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Paris bourse they had to stop trade because of the heavy fall in prices and I think this was the detonator for investors in Madrid to take profits,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Rumours of opinion polls putting the French left ahead of the ruling government, plus cautious notes from the Bank of Spain governor drove down the bourse, but dealers said it was a temporary correction and the upward trend would resume.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this is the end of the gains,&quot; a dealer at a foreign brokerage said. &quot;I wasn't surprised by the size of the fall today, what was surprising was that the market didn't show weakness on Monday or Tuesday.&quot;</p>
<p>Telefonica lost 90 pesetas, 1.99 percent, to 4,430 and Repsol was down 260 pesetas to 6,070.</p>
