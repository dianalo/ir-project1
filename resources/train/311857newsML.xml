<p>Persistent worries about fourth quarter earnings for banks and finance firms prompted local investors to sell Thai shares on Thursday, forcing the volatile index to end down in thin trade.</p>
<p>The SET index dropped 6.34 points to 822.57 on 3.8 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 index retreated 0.57 point to 61.32.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors didn't have confidence in the market...they were also worried about fourth quarter corporate earnings,&quot; said Busaba Kunasirin of Chao Phya Finance.</p>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank posted a slight 1996 profit rise, but the results failed to boost market sentiment, an analyst said.  </p>
<p>Thai Farmers Bank, the third largest Thai bank in terms of assets, today posted a net profit for 1996 of 11.862 billion baht, up from 11.571 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>The results for Thai Farmers Bank failed to boost buying buying sentiment because the figures were lower than investor expectations, said an analyst at a foreign brokerage house. Thai Farmers Bank shares ended unchanged at 124 baht each.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were now waiting to see the balance sheets of other banks which are expected to be released later this month.  </p>
<p>The finance sector dropped the most, falling 3.76 percent. The banking sector retreated 0.81 percent and the communications sector dipped 1.03 percent.</p>
<p>Krung Thai Bank topped the active list, falling three baht to 52. Dhana Siam Finance and Securities dropped 1.50 to 61.50 while Advanced Info Services slipped 12 to 232 and Siam Cement, Thailand's largest cement manufacturer, gained eight to 816.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected investors would be more cautious on investment on Friday ahead of the weekend.</p>
