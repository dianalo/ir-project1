<p>From the streets of Atlanta to the plains of Spain, Swiss riders have brought unprecedented glory to their tiny Alpine nation this year.</p>
<p>Pascal Richard paved the way by winning gold in the Olympic road race.</p>
<p>Then last Sunday Alex Zuelle led compatriots Laurent Dufaux and Tony Rominger to an historic sweep of the Tour of Spain.</p>
<p>Not since 1920, when a trio of Belgians swept the Tour de France, had riders from the same country claimed the top three places in a Tour.</p>
<p>Now Zuelle, Rominger, Dufaux and Richard are determined to add to their successes at next week's world championships in Lugano.</p>
<p>&quot;The victory has given me a lot of confidence,&quot; said Zuelle. &quot;My morale was wavering after a disappointing Tour de France and an Olympics that wasn't much better.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people doubted my ability to win a big Tour and after the Olympics I started to doubt myself. Not anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Swiss riders have prospered individually over the years, with Rominger winning the Tour of Spain three times.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the reason for success is that sport goes in cycles,&quot; said Prospere Dubouloz, vice-president of the Swiss cycling federation. &quot;The Belgians were a great cycling nation for a while but now there is nobody.</p>
<p>&quot;They're at the bottom of the valley right now and we are at a peak. The essential thing is that we are reaping the fruits of our labour.&quot;</p>
<p>While the Swiss cycling federation would like to take credit for the success, even they admit the results have come through good fortune rather than design.</p>
<p>When most of the ONCE team came down with food poisoning during the Tour of Spain, including Frenchman Laurent Jalabert, Zuelle walked away from the dining table unaffected.</p>
<p>Many of the Swiss also benefit from riding for top teams, Zuelle with ONCE, Rominger with Mapei and Dafaux with Festina.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true these are racers of an exceptional class,&quot; Dubouloz said. &quot;Even with our system there might not have been great stars if they weren't of such an exceptional class themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swiss federation is taking an active role in recruiting and nurturing talent in the hope of preventing a sudden slump in the nation's fortunes.</p>
<p>Some of that talent may come out of the Swiss army's bicycle battalion.</p>
<p>More likely it will be produced by the country's Jeunesse et Sport national school in Macolin, a modern state of the art training centre.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a great framework for our youth,&quot; said Dubouloz. &quot;We have good recruiting going and a good infrastructure. Right now the reservoir is full.&quot;</p>
