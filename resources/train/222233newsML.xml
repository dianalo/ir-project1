<text>
<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted largely stable at their previous levels in quiet Thursday trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no trade at the moment, people are just waiting for today's (weekly treasury bill) tender. The market will have a clear direction after that,&quot; one dealer commented.</p>
<p>He said discount houses were purchasing 91-day treasury bills from the central bank at 19 percent and re-selling them in the market at 18.80 percent, the same rates quoted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Negotiable certificates of deposit with maturity of 30, 60 and 90 days were indicated at 21 percent (buying) and 19.25 percent (selling), unchanged from Wednesday, as were bankers acceptance bills at 19.50 and 19 percent.</p>
<p>Call money held steady at 19 percent in a market which was in surplus of Z$47 million at settlement, down from Z$202.1 million previously.</p>
