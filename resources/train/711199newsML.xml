<headline>Blair, Ahern discuss N Irish situation after march.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The British and Irish Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, had a 10-minute telephone discussion on Northern Ireland on Monday following overnight violence, a spokeswoman for Blair said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both of them were determined that the peace process would not be derailed,&quot; she said, describing the conversation as &quot;constructive&quot;.</p>
<p>Violence erupted on Sunday after the Northern Ireland authorities allowed a Protestant Orange Order march to proceed through a Catholic district of the town of Portadown.</p>
<p>Ahern's government said on Sunday that it had &quot;left the British government in no doubt about our serious concern&quot; at the way the parade was handled.</p>
<p>But the spokeswoman for Blair said this criticism was not reflected in his telephone discussion with Ahern. &quot;They agreed to keep in touch and press ahead with the search for peace,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Earlier another aide said Blair was backing his Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, who took the decision to let the march proceed after mounting efforts to get an agreement between Portadown Catholics and Protestants.</p>
<p>&quot;He thinks (she) has done an extremely good job in very difficult circumstances,&quot; he said.</p>
