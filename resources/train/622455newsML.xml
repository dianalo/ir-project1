<title>ROMANIA: Romania agency cancels Azomures selloff contract.</title>
<headline>Romania agency cancels Azomures selloff contract.</headline>

<p>Romania's main privatisation agency said on Wednesday it had cancelled a contract to sell a 51 percent stake in listed fertiliser maker Azomures to a Romanian trading company.</p>
<p>&quot;Euro Trading failed to pay for the purchase of the 51 percent stake and therefore, its contract with the State Ownership Fund (FPS) had been cancelled,&quot; a FPS statement said.</p>
<p>The FPS has control of most Romanian state companies.</p>
<p>The decision came after Euro Trading Chemicals SRL failed to meet a deadline on payment extended from early May.</p>
<p>Euro Trading officials, who could not be contacted since the sale agreement in February, were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>The sale of the Azomures stake to Euro Trading was decided at a tender which aroused controversy with the rival bidder, Omnimpex Chemicals local trader, complaining factors other than price had allegedly been considered.</p>
<p>The FPS said the sale to Euro Trading was for 90,000 lei ($12.81) per share but did not give an overall purchasing price.</p>
<p>Azomures has a share capital of 209.5 billion lei.</p>
<p>Romania's main competition supervisor also launched an investigation into the 51 percent privatisation of Azomures, looking into alleged irregularities at the tender and a possible &quot;economic concentration&quot; in the fertiliser industry.</p>
<p>Euro Trading already acquired majority stakes in another two local fertiliser makers.</p>
<p>The FPS did not detail further plans for Azomures' privatisation after it had cancelled the Euro Trading contract.</p>
<p>But Omnipex said it was ready to start negotiations with the FPS for the sale of 51 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are entitled to request to be invited by the FPS to negotiate a sale-purchase contract for the 51 percent stake in Azomures, in line with the contract between Omnimpex and the FPS concluded during the tender,&quot; an Omnimpex statement said.</p>
<p>Azomures is a Bucharest bourse first-tier stock heavily traded since it joined the exchange last January.</p>
<p>Traders said the cancellation of the privatisation contract would have little if any impact on Azomures bourse trading.</p>
<p>&quot;There is keen interest in Azomures, investors will still stick to its shares no matter what,&quot; a trader said. &quot;And even if the news were to influence trading it would do so for the better.&quot; ($=7,086 lei)</p>
