<text>
<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hogs Tuesday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt higher amid continued firm packer demand that outstripped available hog supplies, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a good run of hogs but there just were not enough,&quot; one Illinois hog dealer said.</p>
<p>Illinois top hog prices at plants were seen steady to $0.50 higher at $57.50 to $58.00.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog prices delivered to plants were seen steady, with a top of $58.50.  </p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs shipped to the plant could range from $58.25 to $58.75, sources there said.</p>
<p>Pork prices were seen holding firm on Tuesday, although the strength could stem more from light production than increased demand, several sources said.</p>
<p>Pork production for the week ended Saturday, Aug 2 was pegged at 295.7 million lbs, down 1.9 percent from the previous week, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Hog slaughter Monday was light due to several plant holidays. Slaughter was estimated at 256,000 head, below 277,000 a week ago and 271,000 a year ago, USDA reported.</p>
