<p>France's Socialist-led government is looking at increasing taxes on companies to help cap the public deficit this year, government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at the possibility of calling for an extra effort from companies and this would be made by companies which are profitable,&quot; she told a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The announcement knocked French stocks, with the CAC-40 blue-chip index falling by more than two percent after rising earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Trautmann said the issue had not been discussed at the cabinet meeting, adding that any decision would have to take account of the results of an audit of public finances due on July 21.</p>
<p>Earlier Socialist party leader Francois Hollande told Europe 1 radio that, &quot;If an extra effort is to be made, it will not be on households, it will not be the French, it will be on those who have made the most profit in the last few years.</p>
<p>&quot;The profitable company will pay,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the French government aimed to meet its commitments made during the campaign ahead of the June 1 parliamentary election and to Europe.</p>
<p>Trautmann said if there were new tax measures, these would be submitted to parliament in September.</p>
<p>She and Hollande gave few details of possible tax increases and the finance ministry had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>But financial daily La Tribune said the government was looking at raising taxes to limit the public deficit to around 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year to ready France for European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>A government source has said the deficit could otherwise be more than 3.4 to 3.5 percent of GDP this year -- above a level seen as acceptable to France's European partners for EMU entry.</p>
<p>Satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine said the government appeared keen to decide measures to reduce the deficit this year before publication of the results of the audit, which it said could forecast the deficit at 3.6 or 3.7 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>It said the finance ministry's budgetary advisors were suggesting raising savings taxes to 25 percent from 20.9, increasing taxes on company capital gains to 33 percent from 19 percent and capping tax breaks on life assurance contracts.</p>
<p>By raising company and savings taxes the government would be sticking to an election manifesto pledge to shift the tax burden off labour and onto capital.</p>
<p>La Tribune said however that the government was unlikely to load all the burden of reducing the deficit this year onto higher taxation.</p>
<p>It would also look at other ways of increasing revenues, including a one-off charge of about 10 billion francs on state-owned savings banks Caisse d'Epargne.</p>
<p>A reduction of 0.3 percentage points in the deficit would represent some 24 billion francs.</p>
