<p>South Africa planned to consolidate all state-owned energy assets into a major company to be listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Minerals and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna said.</p>
<p>Maduna told parliament late on Wednesday that the assets of the Central Energy Fund (CEF) and other energy-related interests held by state institutions would be formed into one integrated company.</p>
<p>Maduna said he aimed &quot;to list the new company on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange as and when appropriate, as a mechanism for recovering and restoring value to government through (the) sale of a significant minority of the share equity&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the government's energy-related assets were scattered among several state entities, including shares in energy company Sasol Ltd held by the state's Industrial Development Corporation and state-owned liqued fuels transporter Petronet included in railways company Transnet.</p>
<p>&quot;There is now an opportunity to unite, consolidate and restructure these assets into a strategically synergistic vehicle based on the disparate elements both within and oudside of the CEF,&quot; Maduna said.</p>
<p>Maduna said a significant minority of the new company would be sold to South African black empowerment groups.</p>
<p>He added that the new company would assist in formulating a Pan-African energy strategy based on using the South African capital market to maximise value for all concerned parties.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective is to transform the CEF group into a more conventional united public holding company, which will proceed to evolve and develop a comprehensive South African energy profile and a leadership role in the energy sector both at home and within a Pan-African context,&quot; Maduna said.</p>
