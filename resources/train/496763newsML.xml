<headline>KL shares end mixed, market awaits banks' reports.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-04-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian shares closed mixed on Wednesday as the market waits for commercial banks to submit their reports on measures to curb property lending, to the central bank on April 15, analysts said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks closed 1.60 points higher at 1,163.85, while the small-cap Second Board index shed 4.19 points to end at 614.16.</p>
<p>&quot;People are waiting for April 15, when (commercial) banks have to submit their plans for meeting Bank Negara's guidelines for property lending,&quot; said Michael Greenall, director of research at Caspian Research in Kuala Lumpur.  </p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are staying away at the moment. The market has not really stabilised, and the (positive) sentiment is not back yet,&quot; said Victor Wan, senior analyst at South Johor Securities.</p>
<p>Renong continued to be one of the most actively-traded stocks, edging two cents higher to 3.92 ringgit. Its reported involvement in a high-speed rail project linking Kuala Lumpur to Singapore and a well-received housing project in the southern city of Johor Baru were the reasons for the stock's activity, analysts said.</p>
<p>Renong officials did not immediately have a comment.</p>
