<p>The opposition Labour Party's lead over the ruling Conservatives has narrowed to 21 percentage points from 25 points a month ago, according to the latest British opinion poll.</p>
<p>The Mori poll for Thursday's Times newspaper puts support for Labour at 52 percent, down from 55 percent in January. Prime Minister John Major's Conservatives were up one point at 31 percent.</p>
<p>Britain's next general election must be held by May 22, although Major is widely tipped to be planning a May 1 vote.</p>
<p>His party has consistently lagged Labour in the polls for the past two years and appears almost certain to be pushed into a minority in parliament this week because Labour is expected to win a key by-election in north west England.</p>
<p>But the MORI poll brought some comfort for Major, showing that two percent more people than last month were optimistic about the economy.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is said to be hoping that Britain's slowly improving economy will boost his party's popularity in the little time he has left before an election.</p>
