<title>KENYA: Kenya sells $133 million of treasury bills.</title>

<p>The Central Bank of Kenya sold 7.893 billion shillings ($133 million) of treasury bill boosted by a significant increase in the number of foreign investors in the market, bank officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Roll-over on maturing treasury bills has improved significantly compared to last week,&quot; William Nyagaka, manager of the bank's National Debt Division said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bank said it received a total of eight billion out of the target 12 billion shillings it hoped to raise.</p>
<p>Last week, the bank sold a dismal 5.074 billion shillings out of 11 billion shillings it offered after many foreign investors usually attracted to the Kenyan market because of high yields and stability declined to roll-over their bills due to political uncertainty.</p>
<p>Nyagaka said the improved turnover signalled investor confidence was slowly returning following the commencement of dialogue on political reforms.</p>
<p>Violent protests for political reforms in Kenya have upset investors, and made many wary of this emerging market.</p>
<p>Nine people were killed in Kenya on Monday during the worst clashes between police and protesters since a violent campaign in July 1990 that helped persuade President Daniel arap Moi to allow multi-party politics.</p>
<p>Of the benchmark 91-day t-bills, the bank said it sold 6.388 billion shillings at an average yield of 18.338 percent compared to 3.781 billion shillings of treasury bills at an average yield of 18.471 percent last week.</p>
<p>The bank said it sold 1.505 billion shillings of the 182-day category of bills at an average yield of 19.330 percent compared to 1.294 billion shillings at an average yield of 19.438 percent.</p>
<p>The bank invited tenders for eight billion shillings of treasury bills for next week's auction on Thursday.</p>
