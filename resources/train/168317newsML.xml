<p>Jordan's Union Bank for Savings and Investment announced on Tuesday it was raising its capital by nine million dinars ($12.7 million) to meet a Central Bank capital requirement of 20 million dinars.</p>
<p>It said the capital increase would come from a private placement of nine million shares offered at a 1.5 dinars each, raising a total of 13.5 million dinars. Nine million would go to the capital raise and another 4.5 into shareholders rights.</p>
<p>Subscription for the offering opens on November 9 and closes on December 9, the bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;This capital hike is to strengthen the bank in line with the Central Bank's policy,&quot; Issam Salfiti, general manager of Union Bank for Savings and Investment told Reuters.</p>
<p>It has already received commitments from existing shareholders to cover at least five million shares, bank officials said.</p>
<p>Union Bank has been raising its capital since last year in three stages to reach a 20 million dinar minimum capital ceiling by mid-1997 under a Central bank deadline.</p>
<p>Its last capital raise was at end of last year when it increased it to 11 million dinars from 9 million dinars by private placement. That followed a 1.8 million dinar increase from the bank's original 7.2 million dinar capital.</p>
<p>The key shareholder of the bank, which approved the capital raise in an extraordinary AGM last September, is Jordan's Salfiti family which owns at least 40 percent of its capital.</p>
<p>Another 23 percent key is owned by U.K.-based Sirt Securities International. Jordan's Housing Bank has a minority 6 percent holding.</p>
<p>The bank saw a significant rise in its assets to 190.5 million dinars at end of 1995, a 19 percent increase over the previous year. Its loans portfolio stood at 57.5 million dinars at end of 1995. Deposits rose 21 percent to 157.6 million dinars at end of 1995.</p>
<p>The bank, one of Jordan's six investment banks, opened its first non Jordanian branch in the West Bank town of Ramallah earlier this year.</p>
