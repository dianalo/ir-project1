<p>Explosives used in a bomb on a Paris rush-hour commuter train were identical to the chemical mixture used in a wave of attacks last year by Algerian Islamic militants, investigators said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The mixture was placed in a 13 kg (28 lb) gas canister, itself wrapped in a bag containing nails to increase casualties. The bomb on Tuesday killed two people and injured 79 others.  </p>
<p>Investigators were continuing to pick through the wreckage of the train for clues on Wednesday evening at the Port Royal station near the Luxembourg Gardens.</p>
<p>Last year's wave of bombings, including three in Paris underground trains, killed eight people and injured more than 160. The extremist Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) claimed responsibility for those blasts.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Alain Juppe told parliament there were striking similarities between Tuesday's bomb and last year's blasts. But he added that investigators had not ruled out other possibilities.</p>
