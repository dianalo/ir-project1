<title>USA: CIA officer pleads guilty to spying for Moscow.</title>
<headline>CIA officer pleads guilty to spying for Moscow.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Harold Nicholson, the highest ranking CIA officer ever charged with spying, pleaded guilty on Monday to selling secrets to Russia for more than $180,000.</p>
<p>Nicholson, 46, was a 16-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine operations directorate where he had access to the names of spies working for the CIA and other secrets. He was station chief in Romania and deputy chief in Malaysia.  </p>
<p>Nicholson was the second national security official to plead guilty to spying for Moscow in the past few days. On Friday, a former FBI counterintelligence agent, Earl Edwin Pitts, pleaded guilty to selling classified information for more than $200,000.</p>
<p>The two latest guilty pleas wrapped up the country's most serious espionage cases since former CIA officer Aldrich Ames was caught spying for Moscow in 1994.</p>
<p>Nicholson was accused of selling national security secrets for 29 months until his November 16 arrest, including the names and planned assignments abroad of new undercover CIA officers. His most recent assignment was as a branch chief in the Middle East division of the counterterrorism centre at CIA headquarters.</p>
<p>Chief U.S. District Court udge James Cacheris accepted Nicholson's plea and set sentencing for June 5.</p>
<p>For entering the plea agreement, Nicholson could get less than a life sentence which he faced if he had been convicted.</p>
