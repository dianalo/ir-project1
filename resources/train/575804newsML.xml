<title>BRAZIL: Reforms, re-election on Brazil Congress agenda.</title>
<headline>Reforms, re-election on Brazil Congress agenda.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-05-12</dateline>

<p>The Brazilian government faces a busy week in Congress where its civil service reform and a bill that would allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election face key votes.</p>
<p>The drawn-out process of voting on amendments to the civil service reform bill in the Chamber of Deputies was due to resume Tuesday.</p>
<p>Amendments proposed by left-wing opposition parties threaten key points of the bill, including a provision that would allow central and local governments to dismiss workers whose jobs are currently protected by the constitution.  </p>
<p>But government officials said they were confident they could muster the three-fifths majority votes needed to kill the amendments, after factions within the powerful Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) settled differences over support for the government.</p>
<p>Pro- and anti-government wings of the PMDB were reported to have struck an agreement over the weekend to support the civil service reform bill and delay until next year the choice of a PMDB candidate to stand in the 1998 presidential election.  </p>
<p>Leaders of the several factions that make up the PMDB were to meet Tuesday to formalize the agreement, which would also include a position on a constitutional amendment allowing Cardoso to run for re-election, newspapers said.</p>
<p>The re-election bill is due to be studied and possibly voted this week by the Senate's Constitutional and Justice Committee. The bill has already been approved once in the committee but was sent back after four amendments were proposed on the Senate floor.  </p>
<p>One of those amendments would force state governors seeking re-election to stand down from office for six months prior to election day.</p>
<p>The proposal is reported to have the backing of about half of the Senate's 81 members who intend to stand as state governors next year.</p>
<p>The government, however, wants to avoid changes to the bill that would mean another round of voting in the Chamber of Deputies.  </p>
<p>The intense negotiations over the re-election bill appear likely to delay a first reading of a new-look pension reform bill in a Senate committee.</p>
<p>Senator Beni Veras, who was given the task of rewriting the pension bill after most of its main points were lost in the Chamber of Deputies last year, probably will not unveil a new version of the reform until next week, an aide to the senator said.</p>
<p>Also this week, a bill laying out rules for the privatization of the telecommunications sector is expected to be put to a vote in a committee in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>The government is likely to keep a close eye on opposition to a constitutional amendment that would extend until 1999 its Fiscal Stabilization Fund (FEF).</p>
<p>The FEF allows the government to sidestep constitutional rules on spending tax receipts that would normally be distributed to states and municipalities.</p>
<p>Mayors and governors are against extending the FEF, which expires June 30.</p>
