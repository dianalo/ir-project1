<p>The U.S. currency is expected to benefit from nervousness over Japan's financial markets and pull up all dollar-denominated assets, especially short-term Treasury issues, U.S. analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Trading is resuming on Monday in Tokyo where financial markets were closed for a full week around New Year.</p>
<p>&quot;If the perception is we are going to go to 120 yen, trading will continue to be dollar-led and other currencies will also depreciate against the dollar,&quot; said chief economist David Resler at Nomura Securities International.  </p>
<p>Resler -- commenting on fears Japanese equities may come under selling pressure -- noted the dollar began to rise versus the yen before the opening bell in Tokyo. The dollar was quoted at 116.70 yen versus 116.28 at the close on Friday.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 stock index is seen as vulnerable because it ended at 19,361.35 on December 30 -- the last day it traded -- or just above the key psychological 19,000 support level.</p>
<p>&quot;By default, dollar-denominated assets are looking attractive in this currency environment,&quot; said Resler who predicted &quot;the most probable, immediate place to go would be the short-end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;But this could affect the U.S. Treasury market across the curve,&quot; Resler said of a capital flight out of Japan and into U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>&quot;If the flight to U.S. assets is driven by Japanese institutional buyers, it could go into longer-dated issues, like bonds, because institutions, like Japanese insurance companies like the long term,&quot; Resler added.</p>
<p>A fixed-income strategist at a brokerage house in New York said his firm was planning on buying medium- and long-term Treasuries in the coming days and that the pace of buying would depend on dollar's strength.  </p>
<p>Resler said Japan has little choice but to allow its currency to soften because the monetary and fiscal policy avenues are already closed. Japan's interest rates are very low and the 1997 fiscal package offers no real stimulus.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of speculators around the world view the only option left on the table for Japan is the foreign exchange option,&quot; said Resler who expected no more than some jawboning from the Bank of Japan in support of the yen.</p>
<p>Currency traders said they do not expect the BoJ to voice support for the yen before the psychological 120-yen level.  </p>
<p>&quot;When Japan does get back on its feet, financial markets will pick up and there will be less capital outflows from Japan. But this has not happened yet,&quot; Blitzer said, adding &quot;Japan continues to be a disappointment.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Blitzer did not conclude a flight out of Japanese equities would necessarily give a fresh boost to U.S. stocks whose fate is influenced by other factors such as uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's next interest rate move.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to assume there is any kind of pattern about what the Fed is going to do next,&quot; noted Blitzer, who tied recent gyrations in the Dow industrials to such uncertainty.  </p>
<p>Kevin Harris, senior currency analyst at MCM CurrencyWatch, said nervousness over the Nikkei may be offset by euphoria over the Dow's 101.60-point surge on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is this wonderful transmission factor in equity markets,&quot; Harris said. &quot;When the Dow does well, it sends this wave that goes around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Harris also expected market forces to be the best ally of the yen and yen-denominated assets as profit-takers may want to cash in gains before the dollar resumes its upward trend.</p>
<p>&quot;After such a run, the dollar may need a little of a pullback,&quot; Harris predicted.</p>
