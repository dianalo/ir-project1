<title>UK: Bond market wrapup - late European trade.</title>
<headline>Bond market wrapup - late European trade.</headline>
<text>
<p>This is how major world bond markets looked at 1630 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>UNITED STATES - U.S. Treasury securities prices remained range bound at midday as dealers had little reason to stake positions.</p>
<p>Amid a dearth of economic data, prices nudged into positive territory by midday from lower earlier levels, as buyers reemerged from rounds of profit taking. But volume remained contained as players awaited the Producer Price Index on Friday, which was widely expected to be market friendly. Futures: September T-bonds at 113-26/32, up 5/32</p>
<p>	    September Eurodollars at 94.22, up 0.01</p>
<p> Cash:    Long bond yield 6.56 percent.</p>
<p>GERMANY - Bunds and futures were hit by profit-taking in late session trade as investors cashed in on a recent strong rally in the market. While prices were substantially lower than Monday's closing levels, analysts said that since the market had only given back some of the previous session's gains, the outlook remained relatively positive. Futures: September Bunds on LIFFE at 102.78, down 0.04</p>
<p>	    September Euromarks at 96.84, down 0.01</p>
<p> Cash:    10-year Bund yield 5.55 percent.</p>
<p>BRITAIN - Gilts ended slightly in the red but off the session lows that above-forecast inflation figures knocked them to. The September gilt future settled 5/32 lower at 114-21, having dropped as low as 114-15 at one point. British underlying inflation rose to 2.7 percent in the year to June. Economists had expected it to stick to the government's target of 2.5. Futures: September Long gilts on LIFFE at 114.68, down 0.12</p>
<p>	    September Eurosterling at 92.8, down 0.05</p>
<p> Cash:    10-year gilt yield 7.02 percent.</p>
<p>FRANCE - Bond futures paused for breath after gaining more than a point and a half so far this month, awaiting further details on the state of public deficits in France and Germany. The September contract touched a new contract high of 130.66 early in the session but drifted lower with Bunds to settle down for the first time in six sessions at 130.38. Futures: September Long bond on MATIF at 130.46, up 0.08</p>
<p>	    September PIBOR at 96.59, down 0.01</p>
<p> Cash:    10-year bond (OAT) yield 5.41 percent.</p>
<p>ITALY - Italy's debt market ended little changed on previous closing levels after the spread over 10-year benchmark bunds narrowed to 95 basis points and the September Btp Liffe contract set a new high at 136.40.</p>
<p>&quot;The Italian market is still positive. But with Bunds at currently high levels and a dollar this strong our market is going to have to rise even more over Germany if it wants to make up more ground in terms of the spread,&quot; one trader said. Futures: September Long bond on LIFFE at 136.3, up 0.06</p>
<p>	    September Eurolira at 93.43, down 0.05</p>
<p> Cash:    10-year bond (BTP) yield 6.52 percent.</p>
<p>JAPAN - The key September 10-year Japanese government bond futures contract ended slightly down, but off lows, as the results of a 20-year JGB auction were better than expected, traders said. &quot;Major foreign and domestic brokerage houses bid aggressively at the auction, and the results look pretty good,&quot; said a trader for a foreign brokerage house. Futures: September JGB future on LIFFE compared with Tokyo close at 124.46, down 0.37</p>
<p>	    September Euroyen at 99.3, down 0.01</p>
<p> Cash:    10-year JGB yield 2.53 percent.</p>
<p>EUROBONDS - Attention in the primary market focused on a 100 billion yen 10-year bond by NTT and a $1.0 billion five-year deal by Canada. NTT sparked controversy because it chose two U.S. banks to underwrite the deal, excluding Japanese houses. Canada's deal will be priced later to yield eight b.p. over Treasuries. The first fixed-rate bond from a Russian bank was launched by SBS-Agro, with raised $200 million. Lithuania came to the market with a $200 million issue.</p>
