<p>Robins said the forestry sector heavyweights like Fletcher Forest, flat at NZ$1.99, and Carter Holt Harvey, up two cents at $3.52, remained in demand from overseas buyers and domestic interest as the world picture for product prices improved.</p>
<p>International interest was also supporting Telecom, which took an early bounce up two cents to $7.14 before steadying around $7.12, and which brokers said appeared to have found a channel between just under $7.10 and $7.20/30 amid the ongoing buyback programme.</p>
<p>Robins noted that the firm bond market of late provided another support layer for Telecom and the forestry stocks.  </p>
<p>In the main, however, dealers said the market was maintaining a directionless holding pattern in advance of the government's first budget and the RBNZ's Monetary Policy Statement at the end of next week.</p>
