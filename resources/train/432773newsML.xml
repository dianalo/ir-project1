<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday named an ex-journalist with no bureaucratic background as his chief of staff in a move to end a tug-of-war between the Kremlin administration and the Russian government.</p>
<p>Valentin Yumashev, 39, replaces Anatoly Chubais, 41, who has been transferred to the government as first deputy prime minister to improve its performance and revitalise economic reform.</p>
<p>Before the summer of 1996, when the newly re-elected Yeltsin formally named Yumashev as an aide, the journalist had made his name in the liberal press and ghost-wrote at least one of the president's books, his 1991 autobiography &quot;Against the Grain&quot;.</p>
<p>Yumashev, who formerly held the post of editor-in-chief at the respected liberal weekly magazine Ogonyok, told Interfax news agency on Tuesday that he did not plan any changes in the presidential administration.</p>
<p>But political analysts have predicted that Chubais' departure will certainly change many things in the functions of the presidential administration, which many opponents have described as a &quot;parallel government&quot;.</p>
<p>Under Yeltsin's plans for a cabinet reshuffle Chubais, who kick-started privatisation in Russia and has gained in influence during Yeltsin's absences through illness in the past eight months, will be the only first deputy premier.</p>
<p>He and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin have worked hand in hand to keep Russia under control and stable in the absence of Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Until now Chubais and Chernomyrdin have vigilantly preserved the power balance between government and presidential administration as a basis for national political stability.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who is now back in the Kremlin and appears to have recovered his health and determination to play a strong and independent role in Russian politics, broke this balance last week by moving Chubais to the government.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Yeltsin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying the departure of Chubais would not weaken the Kremlin administration.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no resons to cut in any way the powers of the presidential administration,&quot; he said. &quot;They are defined (by law).&quot;</p>
<p>But some political commentators suggested that, by appointing a much less powerful political figure as his new chief of staff, Yeltsin could be changing his administration from a powerbase to a personal chancellery.</p>
