<p>The Lipton Championships provided a glimpse into the future of women's tennis Sunday and it looked bright as Martina Hingis and Venus Williams faced each other for the first time.</p>
<p>The two 16-year-olds, projected since their early junior days as players likely to battle for the top ranking into the next century, showcased their contrasting styles in the third round match.</p>
<p>Hingis, the compact and crafty Swiss sensation, struggled early to fend off the looming presence of Williams, a swift six footer (1.83 m), whose beaded braids rattled ominously as she routinely pounded in serves at over 100 miles per hour (161 kph).</p>
<p>But one hour and nine minutes later, Hingis had her 6-4 6-2 victory, improving her unbeaten 1997 match record to 22-0.</p>
<p>For Hingis, the future is now. The Swiss teen, named for tennis great Martina Navritilova, has won four titles this year, including the Australian Open. She will officially take away Steffi Graf's world number one ranking March 31.</p>
<p>Williams has been groomed for the big time much more slowly than Hingis by her father and coach, who enters his daughter in few tournaments each year. But the speedy, long-legged American looks like a force on the horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;For sure she's going to be a good player.&quot; Hingis said. &quot;She just never gives up. She makes the court look so small. She makes one, two steps and she's there.&quot;</p>
<p>Williams let a 3-0 lead slip away in the first set. But she did manage to break Hingis three times in the set before the top seed seized control and the set.</p>
<p>Williams employed more power, while Hingis used deft placement and greater experience to carry the momentum into the second set.</p>
<p>Williams went for big returns, often missing, and fell behind 5-2 in the second. She gave Hingis two match points by double-faulting and Hingis converted the second with a forehand winner.</p>
<p>&quot;I told my Mom in the locker room I kind of made her play worse than I did,&quot; said Hingis, who had 16 unforced errors to 28 for Williams.</p>
<p>&quot;She started pretty well and she was very aggressive at the beginning. But I just didn't want to lose to her. You never want to lose to someone the same age as you,&quot; said Hingis, revealing her added incentive.</p>
<p>The confident Williams seemed unfazed by defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always fun to go out and play a match, win or lose,&quot; she said.</p>
