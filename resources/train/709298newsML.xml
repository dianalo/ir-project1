<p>A group of 60 expatriates led by the Australian defence attache fled fighting in Cambodia on Sunday and crossed the border into eastern Thailand, the attache said.</p>
<p>&quot;I brought 59 other people out, mostly NGO (non-governmental organisation) workers,&quot; Colonel David Mead told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He said the group came from Battambang in northwestern Cambodia where tensions were growing between troops loyal to the country's rival premiers after heavy fighting in the capital Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Mead said the group he brought out included 18 Americans, nine Thais, four Germans and four Filipinos as well as Australians, Britons, Japanese and citizens of the Netherlands, France and other countries. He said he would try to get back into Cambodia on Monday to get more people out. Phnom Penh airport has been closed since Saturday and most airlines serving Cambodia have suspended flights.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are tense and warming up at this end of the country,&quot; Mead said. &quot;This is a FUNCINPEC-dominated area...but of course there's a balance of forces in the area of Battambang -- an area of possible conflict. I'd suggest, depending on what happens in Phnom Penh of course, the chances of a conflict spreading in the Battambang area are significant.&quot;</p>
<p>FUNCINPEC is the royalist party headed by First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. His forces control most of the area near the Thai border. His co-premier, Hun Sen, has tightened his grip on power in Phnom Penh where his forces outnumber Ranariddh's.</p>
<p>Mead said it took about four hours to drive overland from Battambang, and said the convoy of expatriates was stopped several times. But he said he had advised military officials on both sides of the conflict he was bringing people out so he did not have too much of a problem.</p>
