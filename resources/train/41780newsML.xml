<headline>Lasmo up as Merrill raises to &quot;accumulate&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Lasmo Plc gained on Monday as the oil stock was raised to &quot;accumulate&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot; at Merrill Lynch, traders said.</p>
<p>The stock was up 8p at 212-1/2 by 0922 GMT -- after touching a year's high of 214p --in active trade of 2.1 million shares.  </p>
<p>In a 50-page report, Merrill analysts said they were positive on the stock for reasons beyond its expected gains from a rising oil price.</p>
<p>They said Lasmo was one of the most leveraged stocks to the price of oil -- every $1 rise above its assumed 1997 average oil price of $17.90 would raise the company's earnings per share by 25 percent -- but the upgrade was mainly for other reasons.  </p>
<p>Merrill analyst John Wright said the brokerage listed four reasons for turning more positive on the stock -- ranging from the company's management strength to its promising exploration resources.</p>
<p>After extensive restructuring and asset sales in recent years it was a &quot;much more focused company&quot; he said, &quot;it has built a stable platform and has started to expand its exploration expenditure.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there was upside on top of Merrill's conservative valuation on the stock of 213p, and it could rise as high as 250p through the next 12 months.</p>
