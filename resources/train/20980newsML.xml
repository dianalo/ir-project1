<headline>ZIMBABWE MONEY RATES STEADY IN LIQUID MARKET.</headline>
<dateline>HARARE 1996-08-29</dateline>

<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market were quoted little changed from Wednesday's levels in quiet trade on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade is a bit quiet this morning because people are waiting to see what will happen to the (benchmark) treasury bill rate at this afternoon's weekly tender,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Most dealers predicted a further softening of the rates due to continued liquidity in the system.</p>
<p>&quot;We're generally expecting rates to keep going down until maybe we get the next inflation figures which will give direction as to where rates should go,&quot; one dealer commented.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Thursday morning, discount houses were purchasing treasury bills from the central bank at 23.12 percent and selling them at 22.5 percent, a slight drop from Wednesday's 22.8 percent.</p>
<p>NCD bills with maturity of 30, 60 and 90 days were quoted stable at 24 and 23 percent while while bankers acceptance bills were buying and selling at 23.5 and 22.75 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Call money shed half a percentage point to 22 percent in a market which opened with a surplus of Z$183 million from Z$254 million previously.</p>
