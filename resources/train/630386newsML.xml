<p>The Bucharest stock exchange said on Monday another two companies would join in trading this week bringing to six the number of four-tier stocks and to 40 the total number of listings.</p>
<p>Sofert SA state-owned fertiliser maker will join the bourse on Tuesday, while Arctic SA state-run refrigerator maker will be traded starting on Wednesday, an exchange statement said.</p>
<p>It said Sofert, based in the north-eastern town of Bacau, had a share capital of 71.6 billion lei, in shares with a nominal value of 25,000 lei each.</p>
<p>Sofert's main stockholder is the State Ownership Fund (FPS) with a 69.99 percent stake. An investment company holds 12.3 percent and individual shareholders have the rest.</p>
<p>Sofert had a 1996 net profit of 8.8 billion lei, up from 1.9 billion the previous year. It paid a dividend worth 1,228 lei per share last year, up from 261.8 lei per share in 1995.</p>
<p>Arctic, based in Gaesti, 80 km (50 miles) north-west of Bucharest, has a share capital of 57.2 billion lei in shares with a face value of 1,000 lei each. The FPS holds 50.99 percent of Arctic, the company manager has 0.01 percent and the rest is held by individual shareholders, including employees.</p>
<p>Last year, Arctic had a net profit of 11.6 billion lei, up from 9.8 billion in 1995. The 1996 dividend per share was 74.4 lei per share, the statement said. Arctic paid a dividend of 1,560 lei per share in 1995, when its shares were 25,000 lei worth each before a split.</p>
<p>Current first-tier listings on the Bucharest bourse include Azomures fertiliser maker, Oltchim chemical plant and pharmaceuticals companies Antibiotice and Terapia. The second tier lists 34 stocks.</p>
<p>Brokers welcomed the newcomers, saying it would increase share liquidity and would also help raise capital inflows.</p>
<p>&quot;Local and foreign investors have shown a clear preference for first-tier listings in our market, so I am positive capital liquidity will increase,&quot; said a trader. ($=7,110 lei)</p>
