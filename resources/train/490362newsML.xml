<p>Exide Electronics Group Inc said on Monday it will post a charge of $2.0 million for the second quarter ended March 31, 1997 after it restructures its credit facility.</p>
<p>The company's new $170 million senior credit facility, arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities and NationsBanc Capital Markets, will replace a $175 million senor credit facility that was used to help its acquisition of Deltec Power Systems last year, Exide said. Writing off the old debt costs will leade to a one-time tax benefit and interest savings that could improve earnings per share annually by $0.10, Exide said.  </p>
<p>Exide said it also expects second quarter sales at the low end of a range of $140 million to $145 million with a stronger U.S. dollar hurting European revenues.</p>
<p>Revenues in last year's second quarter totaled $101.7 million.</p>
<p>For the year ending September 1997, the company expects total revenues to be in the $580 million to $590 million range with earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization margin in excess of 11 percent for the year, Exide said.</p>
<p>Exide said it had approximately $105 million oustanding under the old credit facility.</p>
<p>The new five year credit facility includes a revolving loand and a term loan, while providing anticpated interest savings of approximately 100 basis points compared to the old facility, Exide said.</p>
