<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co said Thursday its comparable domestic store revenues rose 5.3 percent in October, versus a 4.6 percent increase in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Total domestic store revenues for the four weeks ending Nov. 2 were $2.10 billion, 11.3 percent above revenues of $1.89 billion for the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>&quot;Apparel continued its outstanding performance as customers respond to the quality and value of Sears merchandise selections,&quot; Arthur Martinez, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;Women's ready to wear had strong growth, led by outerwear and sportswear such as leather jackets, sweaters and jeans. Sales of children's and men's apparel showed double-digit increases, as did cosmetics and fine jewelry.&quot;</p>
<p>In hardline merchandise, lawn and garden led with exceptional growth in riding mowers, tractors and snowthrowers, he said. Sears' tire business recorded solid results, while Sears Hardware and dealer stores continued to experience double-digit comparable store increases, he added.</p>
<p>For the four weeks ending November 2, Sears reported total revenues of $2.92 billion, 10.4 percent above the $2.64 billion in the same period of 1995.</p>
