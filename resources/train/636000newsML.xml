<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: SOCCER-TOUGH SEASON FOR EURO 96 HEROES.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-TOUGH SEASON FOR EURO 96 HEROES.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1996-06-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Individually as well as collectively, it's been a tough season for the Czech heroes who came close to winning the European championship in England last summer.</p>
<p>Of the 12 who played in the Wembley final against Germany, all but two have ended up playing abroad, many of them earning lucrative foreign transfers on the back of their Euro 96 showings.</p>
<p>Yet far from basking in glory, many have had a season they would prefer to forget.</p>
<p>Following is a player-by-player look at their career progression -- or decline -- since that Wembley final in June.</p>
<p>Petr KOUBA (Deportivo Coruna, Spain) - Goalkeeper Kouba has seen his way to a regular place barred by the acrobatic Jacques Songo'o, appearing only when Songo'o is on international duty with Cameroon. After playing just one Cup and two league games, Kouba is openly dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Jan SUCHOPAREK (Strasbourg, France) - Played steadily but unremarkably for a team which finished a modest ninth in the league. Highlight of season was assisting his team to League Cup victory and place in UEFA Cup.</p>
<p>Pavel NEDVED (Lazio, Italy) - Scored seven league goals and helped Lazio to fourth in serie A. But his season was marred by the firing of Lazio's Czech coach Zdenek Zeman, with whom he was closely linked.</p>
<p>Miroslav KADLEC (Kaiserlautern, Germany) - Opted to stay with Kaiserlautern despite their relegation to the German second division at the end of last season and helped them back to the upper flight at the first attempt.</p>
<p>Jiri NEMEC (Schalke 04, Germany) - Enjoyed fine season with Schalke, along with compatriot Radoslav Latal, culminating in a surprise UEFA Cup triumph over Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Karel POBORSKY (Manchester United, England) - Regarded as the national team's best player during Euro 96 but had major fall from grace after joining English champions Manchester United. Failed to establish place with United and made only sporadic appearances during the latter half of the season.</p>
<p>Pavel KUKA (Kaiserlautern, Germany) - Like Kadlec, chose to remain with Kaiserlautern despite interest from other clubs. Ended among the leading scorers in the German second division.</p>
<p>Radek BEJBL (Atletico Madrid, Spain) - A midfielder who has failed to live up to high expectations and consequently has been frequently on the substitutes' bench.</p>
<p>Patrik BERGER (Liverpool, England) - Patchy season after transfer to Liverpool from Borussia Dortmund, who went on to win the European Cup without him. Scored twice in each of his first two games in England but spent much of the season on the bench.</p>
<p>Michal HORNAK (Sparta Prague) - Considered moves abroad but decided to stay with Sparta, anchoring a defence which helped the team clinch the title.</p>
<p>Karel RADA (Sigma Olomouc) - Has been out of the spotlight at Sigma but managed to catch the eye of Turkey's Trabzonspor, who have offered a contract for next season.</p>
<p>Vladimir SMICER (Lens, France) - Made bright start with side who stormed to top of league in first month of season with four successive wins. Later faded, along with Lens, finishing the season with just five goals to his credit.</p>
