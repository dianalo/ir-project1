<p>A Greek Cypriot married couple have sought asylum in the northern, Turkish-occupied area of the divided island of Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Iakovos Iakovou, 24, and Xenia Iakovou, also 24, a married couple, crossed and sought asylum,&quot; police spokeswoman Pervin Gurler told Reuters. She said the pair came to the self-declared Turkish Cypriot state on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gurler did not say why the couple had sought asylum or how they had crossed the U.N.-patrolled Green Line cutting through the island.</p>
<p>Diplomatic and security sources said they passed through at Pergamos, a checkpoint manned by the Turkish military skirting a British military base in south eastern Cyprus.</p>
<p>&quot;A decision about whether to hand them back to the south or any other steps to be taken will be made after an investigation is completed,&quot; Gurler said.</p>
<p>Initial reports that the couple had gone to the north in a last-ditch attempt to secure exit visas after failing to get one in the south could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>&quot;They crossed over voluntarily in Pergamos and a member of Unficyp saw them last night,&quot; said a source in the U.N. force stationed on the island since 1964.</p>
<p>&quot;They were in good shape. As we speak one of our guys is over there seeing what they want to do,&quot; the United Nations official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;If they want to return to the south we will help them. If they want to stay they will have to deal with the guys in the north.&quot;</p>
<p>Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974 in response to a Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia that was backed by the military junta then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>Defections of Greek Cypriots to the northern parts of the island are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Only Ankara, which keeps some 30,000 troops in the north, recognises the Turkish Cypriot state.</p>
