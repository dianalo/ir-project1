<title>USA: One-year CRP extension for fall-sown crops - Smith.</title>

<p>U.S. House Agriculture Committee chairman Bob Smith filed a bill Wednesday that would allow a one-year extension of Conservation Reserve Program contracts for farmers with fall-planted crops.</p>
<p>Smith also called a meeting of the committee for Thursday at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT). The panel was expected to approve the bill and send it to the floor, a spokesman said.  </p>
<p>Several million acres of winter wheat, oats and barley land could be affected by the bill.</p>
<p>It was prompted by mounting concern in farm country that the Agriculture Department would bungle a massive turnover of land in the reserve. Contracts on some 21 million acres expire this fall.</p>
<p>During a sign-up period last month, farmers offered 25.6 million acres for enrollment. USDA has said it would notify farmers by early June if their land was accepted.</p>
<p>Enrollment in the reserve is limited to 36.4 million acres and USDA has said it would accept only land with high environmental benefits from the land offered in this year's sign-up period.</p>
<p>Smith's bill would give farmers the option of a one-year extension if USDA does not rule on their bids by May 2 and if they tell USDA by May 17 that they want a one-year contract.</p>
<p>The option would be available only to farmers who have wheat, barley or oats acreage already in the reserve or who offer such land for enrollment.</p>
<p>Lawmakers fear USDA will wait too long to notify farmers, leaving them with insufficient time to prepare land for planting if the land is not accepted for the reserve.</p>
