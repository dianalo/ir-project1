<p>Anti-racist groups on Friday condemned a planned political broadcast on BBC television by an ultra right-wing party that advocates repatriation of non-whites and the re-introduction of capital punishment in Britain.</p>
<p>The British National Party (BNP) broadcast ahead of the May 1 general election has been approved by BBC lawyers and is awaiting the green light from producers on taste and decency standards, a spokesman for the national broadcaster said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are millions of African and Asian tax-payers in this country whose tax contributions are now going to be used to fund a racially divisive propagandist political election broadcast from the BNP,&quot; said Lee Jasper, chairman of National Black Alliance, an umbrella group of anti-racist pressure groups.</p>
<p>&quot;It cannot be right that the money is going to be used to resource what can only be described as a race hate campaign against black British citizens,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The BNP has been blamed by anti-racist groups for a number of racially motivated attacks, particularly in rundown east London. Asked whether the BNP was a racist organisation, party chairman John Tyndall said it depended on the use of the word.</p>
<p>&quot;If you mean we hate other races, no. If you mean that we put our own race first and want to preserve it, yes,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Tyndall championed the rights of &quot;our own people&quot; which he said were British-born whites. Europeans were acceptable because they were basically from the same culture, he said.</p>
<p>Tyndall said the party advocated a withdrawal from the European Union, a tough stance on crime including the restoration of capital punishment and protectionist trade measures against imports to stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Its (BNP policies) are very unpopular among people ...who are against free speech,&quot; Tyndall said. &quot;The ordinary British public might disagree with us but would not dispute our right to be heard.&quot;</p>
<p>The BNP is fielding 56 candidates on May 1 but has yet to win a seat in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Any party fielding 50 candidates or more does qualify for a party election broadcast,&quot; BBC spokesman Kevan McClair said. &quot;The requirements above that is that the broadcast must be legal and must meet acceptable standards of broadcasting.&quot;</p>
<p>Jasper said any political organisation that advocated the denial of democratic freedoms should automatically forfeit its right to enjoy the benefits of a democratic process.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a black British citizen, third generation, am I to be deported?&quot; Jasper asked. &quot;That they should be able to propagate such an idea at the taxpayers' expense in a modern multi-cultural democracy in 1997 is a gross insult to black and Jewish communities throughout this country.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyndall was responsible for his party's biggest success in a by-election in the east London seat of Dagenham in May 1994. He won 1,511 votes or 7.03 percent of the total vote.</p>
<p>If the four-minute BNP programme gets the go-ahead it would be broadcast on the BBC's two television channels on April 25, the BBC said.</p>
<p>It would also be heard twice on BBC radio. Britain's commercial television network also shows political broadcasts.</p>
<p>In October 1993 several protesters were injured when Britain's biggest anti-racist march in 15 years turned violent. About 20,000 protesters were prevented by police from reaching a bookshop in southeast London which served as BNP headquarters.</p>
<p>The British Broadcasting Corporation is funded by a licence fee paid by television owners. Its board of governors is appointed by the government.</p>
