<p>Explosive growth in China and India, whose burgeoning economies will carry huge future fuel requirements, will be a key factor in shaping Asia's rapidly evolving natural gas market, a Japanese energy expert says.</p>
<p>&quot;There is great potential for energy demand from these countries,&quot; Toshinori Tsuji, senior economist at Japan's Institute of Energy Economics (IEE), told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>&quot;China and India will be the key countries, and their demand growth will be a factor that will decide whether the market is tight or not,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tsuji said that if China and India, both with populations close to or above one billion, consumed as much natural gas as their respective government forecasts, it would lead to a huge leap in Asian natural gas consumption.</p>
<p>India's liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand is expected to reach 35 million tonnes in 2010, from 12.9 million tonnes in 1995, according to forecasts by the U.S. consulting firm Poten and Partners Inc.</p>
<p>China's LNG demand is expected to reach 50 million tonnes in 2010, up from 12.7 million tonnes in 1995, the firm said.</p>
<p>The two countries are expected to see some of the largest growth in natural gas consumption in all of Asia.</p>
<p>A lack of sufficient pipeline infrastructure in Asia has meant that the majority of Asia's trade in natural gas has been in the form of LNG.</p>
<p>Asia's consumption of natural gas amounted to 190.7 billion cubic metres in 1995, or roughly 10 percent of total world consumption, the IEE said in a report last month.</p>
<p>New natural gas demand from electric power utilities is likely to bolster Asian consumption of energy, the private think tank said.</p>
<p>Noting that some upward revisions have been made to natural gas production at various natural gas fields, energy experts have said that abundant supplies of natural gas could lead to a glut or increased pricing competition.</p>
<p>IEE's Tsuji said, however, that he doesn't expect the natural gas market to suffer from a severe supply and demand imbalance.</p>
<p>The market would be oversupplied if all the gas fields now being explored started full production, he said.</p>
<p>However, he noted that as a general rule commercial production at a natural gas field does not start until a specific buyer is found for the natural gas.</p>
<p>&quot;It's virtually impossible to have a situation where actual production of (natural gas) greatly exceeds demand,&quot; Tsuji said.</p>
<p>Koshiro Goda, Japan Gas Association vice president, told a global conference in Copenhagen in June that demand in east Asia will probably reach around 300 billion cubic metres by 2010, more than double the current demand of around 140 billion cubic meters.</p>
