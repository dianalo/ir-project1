<p>France's conservative government on Wednesday presented a 1997 budget which aims to revive growth by cutting taxes while reducing the budget deficit to guarantee the country a place in European monetary union.</p>
<p>It said it would reduce the total public deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) or below in 1997, the key year for deciding which countries can join a single currency when it is launched in 1999.</p>
<p>The government also pledged to carry on with spending curbs in the years to come, saying it would aim to reduce the public deficit to below two percent of GDP in 2001.</p>
<p>Germany, France's main partner in driving forward plans for monetary union, has insisted on a commitment to limiting public deficits afterwards, to ensure the new euro becomes as stable a currency as the mark is now.</p>
<p>Government ministers, wary of the kind of industrial unrest which paralysed France late last year and facing parliamentary elections in 1998, emphasised, however, that the budget would also cut taxes and encourage consumer spending.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a compromise between the Maastricht rules and what their (parliamentary) majority and public opinion is pressing them for,&quot; ABN Amro economist Philippe Brossard said.</p>
<p>The government appeared to have shied away from the tough austerity expected earlier in the year, announcing that it would make only a small reduction in the central government budget deficit while using one-off revenues to meet its target.</p>
<p>The central government budget deficit is to be reduced to 283.7 billion francs ($55.07 billion) next year from 288 billion francs forecast for this year, after taking account of the income tax cuts.</p>
<p>Economists said they were disappointed France had not gone for tougher spending curbs, particularly since Germany appeared to be trying to make real lasting cuts in public spending.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite disappointing, this smaller-than-expected cut in the central government budget deficit,&quot; JP Morgan economist David Naude said.</p>
<p>&quot;A quality gap might appear between Germany, where federal expenditures are supposed to be cut in absolute terms, and France, where the political compromise has finally resulted in a (relatively) soft budget,&quot; Morgan Stanley economist Eric Chaney said.</p>
<p>Paul Horne of Smith Barney said the budget was &quot;on the path of the spirit of monetary union&quot; but he, too, was worried that the government was opting for a soft route.</p>
<p>&quot;It is moving toward the three percent (deficit) of GDP for 1997. But the quality of the the deficit reduction compares badly with Germany where we have been seeing some attacks on the structural problems,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>But economists said the fact France looked set to reduce its deficit to three percent of GDP next year -- seen as a near impossible goal earlier this year -- improved prospects that monetary union would go ahead on schedule in 1999.</p>
<p>Without France on board, monetary union is seen as impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;In a nutshell, the 1997 budget implies that the French franc is most likely to be replaced by the euro in 1999, as scheduled,&quot; Morgan Stanley economist Eric Chaney said.</p>
<p>In its complex budgetary balancing act, the government plans to cut income taxes by 25 billion francs though excise duties on alcohol and tobacco are to go up by six billion francs, partly to fund the deficit-burdened welfare system.</p>
<p>The government is also to unfreeze savings in popular savings schemes (PEPs), which it said would release a further 15 billion francs into the economy.</p>
<p>The aim is to revive growth to 2.3 percent next year from an anaemic 1.3 percent forecast this year and start making inroads into the country's record 12.5 percent unemployment rate.</p>
<p>&quot;It may not be recognised today, but economic history will say it was in 1997 that France turned its back on the ballooning of public spending and began the reduction in taxation that was so long awaited,&quot; Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said.</p>
<p>To reduce its deficit, the government announced some spending cuts, notably on job creation programmes that have failed to produce jobs.</p>
<p>But it also relied on one-off revenues to bring the deficit down from a targeted four percent of GDP this year.</p>
<p>In particular, the government said its three percent deficit/GDP ratio took account of a 37.5 billion franc transfer from France Telecom to the state next year to cover some pension liabilities after the company is partially privatised. ($1=5.151 French Franc)</p>
