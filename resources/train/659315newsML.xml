<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were mostly stable in late trading on Friday, with demand staying thin amid falls in Malaysia, traders said.</p>
<p>They said palm olein was quoted at 1,385-90 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged from the opening, but trades were also heard at 1,375-85 rupiah. Crude palm oil was last done at 1,176 rupiah/kg exBelawan at a tender in Medan on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was relatively quiet due to the falls in Malaysia which dampened sentiment,&quot; one trader said. &quot;I think prices will weaken a little next week before they rebound. Prices are nearing the bottom&quot;  </p>
<p>The traders also said it was too early to tell if the El Nino weather pattern forming in the southern Pacific would impact production. A local expert said on Thursday it was unlikely to cause serious damage to crops in Indonesia.</p>
<p>They crude palm oil production picked up significantly late last month and the peak could come over the next few months.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been hearing that production just shot up towards the end of last month,&quot; one trader said. &quot;But I don't know if this is because of extensive harvesting after last month's general elections or due to the output cycle.&quot; Another trader said some mills were running 24 hours to process fruits.</p>
