<p>Northern Ireland peace broker John Hume is the favourite to succeed Mary Robinson as President of Ireland in October, an opinion poll showed on Sunday.</p>
<p>Hume remains non-committal about whether he will stand for the position and said at the weekend that he would not make up his mind until the month's end.</p>
<p>&quot;I am considering the possibility. That's all I have to say,&quot; he told reporters at the weekend in his home town of Londonderry in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Hume would be the first person from Northern Ireland to hold what was seen largely as a ceremonial post until Robinson invested it with a brief to speak for the Irish diaspora and the dispossessed of the world.</p>
<p>Dublin's Sunday Independent said that in a telephone poll he was given 42 percent support, double that of the nearest declared candidate, former Prime Minister Albert Reynolds.</p>
<p>Reynolds, who helped build a Northern Ireland peace process with Hume but left office when his government collapsed in 1994, formally announced at the weekend that he wanted the job.</p>
<p>All other declared candidates, including opposition politicians Mary Banotti and Avril Doyle and Maire Geogheghan-Quinn, a former justice minister of the ruling Fianna Fail party, trailed far behind.</p>
<p>Dana, a former singer and devout Catholic strongly opposed to abortion, won only four per cent of the poll.</p>
<p>Dana said last week she would be honoured to stand if a campaign by Catholic activists succeeded in winning her a nomination. A candidate needs the backing of 20 members of parliament to run for the election, scheduled for early October after Robinson takes up her new job as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's minority government could avoid a costly election if his Fianna Fail and Progressive Democrats coalition agreed a candidate with the opposition Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left.</p>
<p>Hume, a member of the European and British parliaments, would fit that bill, according to political sources in Dublin, but is unlikely to make his intentions known until he has taken a holiday ahead of crucial Northern Ireland peace talks in September.</p>
<p>If he ran, it would anger pro-British Protestant Northern Ireland Unionists who fear that the real aim of the talks process is to prepare the way for a merger of the British province with the mostly Catholic Irish republic.</p>
<p>Hume will take part in the talks as leader of the moderate Irish nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party.</p>
<p>The negotiations will include Sinn Fein, political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas, providing their July 20 ceasefire is deemed by Britain to have held.</p>
<p>Hume and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams co-wrote proposals for a Northern Ireland settlement, parts of which were incorporated into the current Anglo-Irish initiative.</p>
<p>Friends say Hume is habitually exhausted because of a punishing schedule rotating between the British and European parliaments, the Belfast peace talks and Londonderry.</p>
<p>According to media reports, he would turn the presidency into a symbol of Ireland's search for a lasting North-South peace and an opportunity to canvass for investment, something he has done with great success for his native Londonderry.</p>
