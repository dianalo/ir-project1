<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Tuesday that she hopes negotiations will resume this week to save thousands of acres of ancient California redwood trees from being logged by the timber company that owns them.</p>
<p>The California Democrat said in a brief interview that negotiations would resume &quot;at the very latest next week; I'd be hopeful before,&quot; to save the Headwaters Grove and nearby ancient redwoods in Humboldt County.</p>
<p>&quot;We're trying to get additional information&quot; before negotiations resume, Feinstein said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The government has been negotiating with Pacific Lumber Co., a unit of MAXXAM Inc, to exchange the virgin forest for surplus federal land or rights to harvest trees on other federal land. Maxxam pledged a two-week moratorium starting Monday on taking trees in the area, which is home to both endangered fish and birds.</p>
<p>The struggle between environmentalists and the company sparked one of the largest one-day mass arrests in California history on Sunday. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday there were 897 arrests. Those arrests are keeping the focus on the negotiations.</p>
<p>Feinstein said she spoke with Deputy Interior Secretary John Garamendi and California State Resources Secretary Doug Wheeler Monday and planned to talk to them again Wednesday.</p>
<p>One of the key issues appears to be how many acres should be saved. The company defines the grove and its buffer area as about 4,500 acres. Feinstein said that in addition &quot;there's some other little areas in there with ancient forests that are called the lesser cathdrals.&quot;</p>
<p>Bob Irelan, a spokesman for Maxxam in Houston, said those other areas amount to 1,800 acres and are also included in the moratorium. He said no written list had been issued detailing areas were covered by the moratorium.</p>
