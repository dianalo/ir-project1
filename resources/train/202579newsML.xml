<headline>Highlights of interview with Mexico's Zedillo.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-11-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following are highlights of a Reuter interview with Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo held on Tuesday:</p>
<p>- On increased free trade among APEC nations:</p>
<p>Mexico...is in favour of this liberalisation, subscribes fully to this commitment, and Mexico would like to see a much clearer critical route regarding how to reach that goal.</p>
<p>- On what Mexico can learn from Asian &quot;Tiger&quot; economies:</p>
<p>It all comes down to one basic factor: the increase in domestic savings...each one has its own story, but there is a common denominator: they all have a very high savings rate.  </p>
<p>I think that has been our weak point, we have done practically everything else, but we have neglected the domestic savings aspect.</p>
<p>I think thanks to these reforms, and those we will continue making, especially to encourage popular saving, Mexico will have in a very short time an outlook very similar, in terms of growth, to what we have seen in South East Asia, but perhaps even more optimistic, because of natural resources and our geographic location.  </p>
<p>- On relations with the United States</p>
<p>Something very important which I hope will happen in this second stage of the Clinton administration, is that there is support from the Congress for the Clinton administration so that the impetus in favour of free trade in the Americas, which was practically halted in 1996 and a good part of 1995, can be taken up again.  </p>
<p>- On NAFTA</p>
<p>The expectations that the Mexican government had, both the previous administration and mine, have I think been amply satisfied. In fact I consider that the difficult situation we went through in 1995 was a great test for NAFTA and a test which was passed...I think it is irresponsible to suggest the revision of NAFTA at this time.</p>
<p>I think the next step of having Chile in NAFTA is a natural step...with the same philosophy I am seeing a domino effect is being generated that would make free trade in the Americas feasible by the year 2005.  </p>
<p>- On economic policy</p>
<p>We need a process of dynamic economic growth sustained for many years to achieve development, which is what Mexico needs.</p>
<p>I am convinced that a prudent fiscal policy is what the country needs to grow, to generate jobs, so that there are better wages, to open up better opportunities for the people.</p>
<p>- On economic growth:</p>
<p>Our plan is to reach growth of at least 4 percent in 1997, in 1998 to be perhaps above 5 percent and with expectations which I think are well founded of closing the last two years of this century with growth of around six percent.  </p>
<p>- On recent political reforms:</p>
<p>We have achieved an accord among political parties on a grand constitutional reforms, we have had disagreements on a secondary law, which unfortunately some media have preferred to present disagreements on points of the secondary law as though they wiped out the grand agreement.  </p>
<p>I am convinced that for democracies to be viable in the long term they must be sustained by public financing, not exclusively but mainly, and that the public financing is sufficient so there are no incentives to cheat, to break the law...We are remedying a historical situation of insufficient transparency in the financing of political parties, starting with mine and its relationship to the government...</p>
<p>- On divisions within the ruling PRI party:</p>
<p>I think it is a question of communication and interpretation...To attribute Mexico's problems to a conspiracy would be a kind of escapism, escapism from reality.  </p>
<p>- On legislative elections in 1997:</p>
<p>The PRI has shown that it is a party which respects the law...What will happen in 1997 will depend on only one thing, the vote... No one can win the Congress in 1997 except the PRI. Why? Because the Senate is not up for grabs. Only a third of the Chamber of Senators will be renewed. And given the current composition of the Senate, it is impossible that the PRI would lose the majority in the Senate. What is up for grabs is the (lower house) Chamber of Deputies. A law in Mexico cannot be approved if both chambers do not agree.  </p>
<p>- On living with the opposition</p>
<p>Political cohabitation in Mexico is already a fact... plurality is everywhere.</p>
<p>- On Mexico's future:</p>
<p>I honestly believe that Mexico will have the profile in the 21st century of a great world power, and it is not that we want to be more important than other nations, but there are things which are inevitable, because of our territory, our population, our history, I believe Mexico is called upon to be a great country in the 21st century, doubtless with problems, but we are going to achieve that.</p>
<p>- On Chiapas peace talks with Zapatista (EZLN) rebels</p>
<p>I don't want to fix a term for the talks, I want it to be resolved as quickly as possible, but in a way satisfactory to all the parties...it has to be a serious, feasible accord...</p>
<p>The EZLN...now I would not even dare call (them) a guerrilla group.</p>
