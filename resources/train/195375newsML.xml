<p>Palestinian and Israeli negotiators scheduled talks in self-ruled Jericho for Sunday night to try to sew up a long-delayed Israeli troop pullback from the Arab West Bank town of Hebron, PLO officials said.</p>
<p>The last round of talks on Thursday, attended by U.S. diplomats, failed to bring the sides closer together.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials blamed the failure on Israel's insistence its soldiers be allowed to re-enter the 80 percent of the city due to be handed over to the PLO.</p>
<p>&quot;With this condition, no way will there be an agreement,&quot; chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Reuters. &quot;I'm not sure the Israelis have comprehended that we will not change the signed deal.&quot;</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has rejected any renegotiation of the Hebron accord which was signed last year by a left-centre Israeli government ousted in May by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Netanyahu seeks to alter the Hebron accord, maintaining it fails to adequately protect some 400 Jewish settlers who live and study among the more than 100,000 Palestinians of the town.</p>
<p>Under the interim PLO-Israel peace deal, Hebron was to be handed over to Palestinian self-rule last year, but Israel delayed the transfer for security reasons.</p>
<p>Erekat said Palestinian and Israeli negotiators were preparing letters of assurances to be exchanged between Arafat and Netanyahu. He said Palestinians wanted guarantees of continued implementation of peace deals suspended in May.</p>
<p>&quot;We submitted a list of issues we want mentioned in the letter which include specifying dates for resumption of final status talks, dates for talks on implementing interim ourstanding issues which require further negotiations and dates for implementing issues that don't require further negotiation.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli spokesman Moshe Fogel said in the letter which Israel wanted from Palestinians, &quot;the principle of reciprocity is a point we believe is an integral part of the agreements, and we want Palestinians to live up to the agreements&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu said many times he was willing to live up to the agreements, but there are a series of Palestinian violations of the agreement and a number of issues that Palestinians have to address,&quot; Fogel told Reuters.</p>
<p>Senior PLO security officials said they were having continuous contacts with their Israeli counterparts.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed that redeployment will be swift and will take place in an organised manner,&quot; said a senior PLO security official who declined to be identified.</p>
