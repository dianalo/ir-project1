<p>Two car bombs killed 15 people and wounded 23 in hotels in a thermal resort in northwest Algeria at the weekend, the Algerian newspaper Le Matin said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the bombs exploded 10 minutes apart in Sidi Bouhanifia, about 325 km (200 miles) from the capital, Algiers.</p>
<p>&quot;The two blasts killed 15 people and wounded 23, including a child, badly hurt in the head and whose hand was blown off,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>It added that the blast was so powerful that &quot;according to a medical source half those killed could not be identified.&quot;</p>
<p>Sidi Bouhanifia is a thermal resort about 20 km (12 miles) from Mascara. One bomb hit the Sahara hotel destroying the building. A second, outside the Hotel El Farah, caused widespread damage, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>There was no claim of responsibility for the attack but the authorities have blamed Moslem rebels for hundreds of bombs and other attacks over the past five years.</p>
<p>The attack was carried out just hours before Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, addressing his first popular rally since his election in 1995, said on Saturday his government has won over Moslem rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;The terrorism in our country has lost the war thanks to the courage and sacrifices of our people and its security forces,&quot; said Zeroual using the official &quot;terrorism&quot; term to describe Moslem guerrillas who have been fighting to try to topple the government.</p>
<p>&quot;The state has the firm determination to restore the peace and the stability in the country,&quot; said Zeroual speaking at a popular gathering in the southern town of Ghardaia, 470 km (290 miles) south of Algiers.</p>
<p>Zeroual said the parliamentary election to be held on June 5 would be another &quot;political victory&quot; on the path to establish a multi-party democracy in Algeria.</p>
<p>Algeria has been torn by violence since shortly after the authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
