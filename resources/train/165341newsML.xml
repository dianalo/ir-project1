<p>J.C. Penney said Sunday it agreed to buy Eckerd Corp. in a $3.3 billion cash, stock and debt deal establishing the retailer as a major player in the rapidly consolidating drug store industry.</p>
<p>Penney executives said Eckerd's 1,724 drug stores make an excellent geographical fit with its own Thrift drug store chain, which has already been boosted by a string of recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>Once the Eckerd deal is completed early in 1997, Penney will have about 2,800 drug stores stretching across the Northeast, Midwest and the Sunbelt, with combined sales expected to reach almost $10 billion in fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major strategic step creating one of the nation's premier drug store businesses,&quot; Penney Chief Executive James Oesterreicher told Reuters.</p>
<p>Penney will launch a $35 per share cash tender offer for 37.1 million shares of Eckerd, whose stock closed at $28.75 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In the second stage of the purchase, Eckerd stockholders will receive 0.6604 of a Penney share for each Eckerd share, based on Penney's closing price of $53 on Friday, also on the NYSE.</p>
<p>Penney will also assume $760 million in Eckerd debt.</p>
<p>Eckerd, based in Largo, Fla., operates 1,724 drug stores in 13 states and 542 Eckerd Express Photo labs in 11 states. Its operations are concentrated in the Florida and Texas markets, but it spreads across the South, with sales of over $5 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Plano, Texas-based Penney has been in the drug store business for 27 years. But it began its rapid expansion in the industry only in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>It bought Kerr Drug Stores in North Carolina in 1995 and recently paid about $285 million for Fay's Inc. in upstate New York and Pennsylvania. It also expects to complete a previously announced purchase of 200 Rite Aid stores in early 1997.</p>
<p>Oesterreicher said Penney has a proven track record in the business and was taking advantage of market conditions to expand.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a new venture, or an experiment, for us,&quot; he said. &quot;The drug industry is rapidly consolidating and we had a chance to be a player.&quot;</p>
<p>The Thrift/Eckerd deal follows last week's agreement by Drugstore giant Revco D.S. Inc. to buy regional chain Big B Inc. in a sweetened takeover valued at $380 million, and a deal earlier last month in which Rite Aid Corp. agreed to buy West Coast chain Thrifty PayLess Inc. for $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Eckerd had been viewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which had rejected Revco's initial offer.</p>
<p>Penney earlier this year tried to buy Dayton Hudson, but talks fell through and it turned its eye to Eckerd.</p>
<p>With Thrift strong in the Northeast and Eckerd's stores spread across the South, the two chains have only minor overlap in North and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Penney executives said the acquisition would carry some one-time costs and would have a &quot;modest&quot; negative impact on earnings per share in 1997, but that it offered substantial savings and would boost earnings per share from 1998 onward.</p>
<p>Eckerd's president and chief executive, Frank Newman, who is to lead the combined drug store operations, said the merger would bring $100 million in initial synergies, with additional cost savings later.</p>
<p>The synergies include savings on information systems, making use of greater purchasing power and reducing administrative, transportation and advertising costs.</p>
<p>Newman said Eckerd's management and board of directors had looked at a number of strategic options and agreed unanimously that the Penney deal was the strongest.</p>
<p>&quot;It is best for our shareholders because they will receive a generous price for their investment in Eckerd and an opportunity to continue to participate in our continuing growth through their investment in J.C. Penney,&quot; Newman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Newman told Reuters that Eckerd's Express Photo Labs were a key part of the deal and that on-site photo processing would be introduced into more stores of the combined company.</p>
<p>The acquisition has already been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. It still requires Eckerd shareholder and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Penney said its board of directors also approved plans to buy back 15 million shares to complete the share exchange, which calls for the company to issue about 24 million shares.</p>
