<p>Pilot strikes at the start and end of the long Easter weekend are set to disturb domestic flights and holiday plans at the eve of total liberalisation of French airspace.</p>
<p>TAT European Airlines, a unit of British Airways Plc and the main domestic rival of Air France, said on Thursday that its pilots and ground staff had called for a one-day strike on Friday whih it said would lead to heavy disturbances in its flight programme.</p>
<p>Earlier, two unions representing pilots and flight engineers at the Air France Europe airline called on Thursday for a two-day strike starting Monday March 31.</p>
<p>French airspace, up to recently dominated by Air France, will be opened up to competition from April 1 in line with European open skies rules.</p>
<p>In the past two years, a number of big domestic routes have already been opened to competition, leading to a big increase in flights, lower ticket prices and worsened financial results for the companies operating the lines.</p>
<p>Air France Europe, the former Air Inter, is being overhauled by parent Air France as part of a restructuring aimed at improving financial results and at getting the state group ready for privatisation from the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Air Liberte, a private airline, went into bankruptcy protection at the end of 1996 and has been taken over by TAT in a deal with Banque Rivaud. An other operator is AOM.</p>
<p>Air France Europe unions USPNT and SPIT said in a joint notice to Air France chairman Christian Blanc that they were protesting against the absence of negotiations on renewing a company agreement on work conditions.</p>
<p>Air France is taking over Air France Europe operations through a management lease agreement ahead of a full legal merger due in September.</p>
<p>The unions said they were opposed to the imposition of employment current at Air France, under the management lease, which harmed Air France Europe pay conditions.</p>
<p>They also objected to the introduction of pay measures into the whole Air France group which would hurt present and future crews, notably a double pay scale, one for current crews and a lower starting pay for younger pilots to be hired.</p>
<p>An Air France Europe spokeswoman said the extent of disruption would be known on Friday.</p>
<p>The two unions between them represent around 50 percent of the 770 pilots and flight engineers in Air France Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The Air France pilots obtained a certain number of things. We want to get the same,&quot; an official of the SPIT said.</p>
<p>Air France pilots last week decided to delay a four-day strike called for March 23 until May, after the company made proposals on the double pay scale which were seen open to a compromise. The delay was partly obtained after Blanc let it be know he could resign if the strike would be effected.</p>
