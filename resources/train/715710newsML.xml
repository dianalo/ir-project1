<title>UK: Med oil products mixed - gas oil firm on Italy buy.</title>
<headline>Med oil products mixed - gas oil firm on Italy buy.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>Mediterranean oil products were mixed on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline slipped $1 a tonne but naphtha was steady supported by firmer Asian swaps.</p>
<p>Dealers said Nigeria demand was continuing to support current levels on gasoline and talk for naphtha was $2 a tonne above the formula for north African grades.</p>
<p>Gas oil prices were firmer with supportive buying into Italy and Spain and recent demand for product to fill tenders into Turkey and Greece leaving supplies generally tighter.</p>
<p>Traders said diesel's narrow differential to 0.2 sulphur oil was also adding to the tightness.</p>
<p>&quot;Refiners are reluctant to run EN590 while the differential to 0.2 sulphur material is so small&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>They said there was good buying for prompt diesel cargoes with around three buyers chasing one cargo. Demand for second half July was also seen staying strong.</p>
<p>0.2 sulphur supplies were also tight following good demand from the east Med. A Russian cargo was reported traded at benchmark quotes fob high +$4 a tonne fob Italy with diesel actively bid at the same level.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil was largely unchanged with the market said to be stable on low avails with no new incoming Russian material.</p>
<p>&quot;The Black Sea is completely dry that's why the market rose recently,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to put figures in the absence of deals but I think the market for high sulphur is $88/$89 cif,&quot; a second trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Levels are much more stable in the Med than in northern Europe both for cracked and straight-run because of the low supplies,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>One percent was quiet but a large cargo, up to 70,000 tonnes, bought by a trader in NWE at a floating price was heard headed to the Mediterranean.</p>
