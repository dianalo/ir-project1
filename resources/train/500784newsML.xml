<p>--The government will place the emphasis on changes to the job market during talks with unionists and employers to start soon, according to Prime Minister Costas Simitis.

Simitis was speaking at the Economist Roundtable with the Greek government last night.</p>
<p>--Tomorrow's meeting between bank employee representatives and the Association of Greek Banks will determine the fate of the new collective wage agreement for banks.</p>
