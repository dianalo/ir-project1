<title>USA: CBOT wheat ends up, gains pared by crop tour data.</title>

<p>CBOT wheat futures ended higher Wednesday but uncertainty over data from ongoing U.S. Plains crop tours spurred nervous selling that pared gains late, traders and market observers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have some reports that the Oklahoma crop is down and the Kansas crop will likely be better than last year,&quot; said Sid Love, grain analyst with Kropf and Love Consulting. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a mixed bag of tricks out there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many crop scouts on the Wheat Quality Council tour were reporting less damage than initially expected from an April freeze, and those reports prompted late selling, traders said.</p>
<p>Other supportive factors in the Wednesday's wheat market included continued commercial buying and ideas that the market was oversold and due for a technical bounce, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think more than anything else the market was just oversold,&quot; said a floor trader.</p>
<p>Traders again noted moderate buying linked to firms with ties to the cash market. On Tuesday, wheat prices fell to levels that were attractive to end-users, and there was a number of export tenders for U.S. wheat overnight.</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures ended one to five cents per bushel higher, with July up 1-3/4 at $4.04-1/4 per bushel.</p>
