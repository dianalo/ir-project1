<title>USA: CSCE coffee up on extended Brazil weather outlook.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee up on extended Brazil weather outlook.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures were higher ahead of midday, led by sharp gains in the spot September contract, as weather forecasts predicting colder temperatures in Brazil's coffee belt late next week fueled speculative buying, traders said.</p>
<p>September arabicas shot up to a morning high of 198.00 cents a lb before easing to 196.75 cents, up 7.85 cents.  Although CSCE showed two prints at 199 cents for September futures, it subsequently changed the morning peak to 198 cents.</p>
<p>Second-month December was 4.20 higher at 170.25, while the back months gained 2.00 to 3.00 cents.  </p>
<p>Arabicas prices headed higher at the outset, with September gapping up more than 2.00 cents, on mixed trade and speculative buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It opened 2.00 higher and everybody like it,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It broke 193.00 (chart resistance for September) and it was no holds barred.&quot;</p>
<p>Long-term weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing areas during the weekend of Aug 9 fueled the bullish tone, they said.</p>
<p>Weather forecaster Cropcast said Wednesday long-range guidance models show Brazil's coffee belt could see colder temperatures late next week, with the probability of a freeze set at 15 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential for freezing temperatures late next week does exist,&quot; Cropcast said in its daily weather summery on Wednesday. &quot;And this could result in damage to the coffee trees and next year's crop.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said continued uncertainty over whether there would be sufficient exchange-certified coffee stocks for delivery against the September contract also bolstered sentiment.</p>
<p>Technically, traders were now eyeing the $2 in the September contract as an overhead target.</p>
<p>Volume as of 1100 EDT reached an estimated 3,457 lots.</p>
