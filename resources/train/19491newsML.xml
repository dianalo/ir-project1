<p>U.S. municipal bond cash prices ended flat to higher selectively, while muni futures ended between 1/4 and 3/8 of a point higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail is not snapping (bonds) up, and customers keep selling bonds,&quot; one trader said, adding, however, that selling was less brisk than Tuesday's. The trader judged the market unchanged to up 1/8 point in spots.</p>
<p>A municipal analyst said dollar bonds were up 1/8 point, while high-grade issues improved slightly. Overall, the market was flat to up 1/4 point in light to moderate activity, he said.  </p>
<p>In debt futures the September municipal contract closed up 10/32 at 114-27/32. The September T-bond contract closed down 5/32 at 108-25/32. The MOB spread was 194 ticks.</p>
<p>In the government market, the benchmark 30-year bond ended down 3/32 at 97-3/32 to yield 6.98 percent.</p>
<p>Municipal market activity is expected to slow as the Labor Day weekend nears, a trader said. The Public Securities Association has recommended a 1400 EDT early close Friday for municipals and U.S. government bonds as well as several other markets.  </p>
<p>In new issues, Smith Barney Inc said it repriced $395 million New York State Dormitory Authority bonds, lowering yields in several maturities and cutting the top yield in 2026 to 6.23 percent from 6.25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it was a pretty reasonable pricing,&quot; Tony Tanner, an assistant portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds, said. &quot;This is the first large-scale deal in the New York market in two weeks, so certainly that made a difference in terms of how aggressive they were going to be.&quot;  </p>
<p>On some occasions involving borrowers &quot;of this large a stature,&quot; underwriters will jump out with aggressive pricing at the start, Tanner said.</p>
<p>&quot;In this case they priced the bonds appropriately and got enough of a book to fill it and have a slight price adjustment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tanner said he heard the 2022 and 2026 maximum-yield term bonds received &quot;strong interest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here, we thought the bonds priced in 2010 were particularly attractive,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;They were a six percent coupon to yield 6.05 percent, which is a good yield for that kind of 14-year intermediate term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer put in for some of those 2010 bonds for its $645 million Limited Term New York Municipal Fund, Tanner said.</p>
<p>Thomas Devane, the Dormitory Authority's deputy executive director, said the sale went &quot;very well.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We had three different series of bonds,&quot; he said. &quot;We had some insured bonds, we had some serials, we had some term bonds and I think we had a menu there for just about any kind of buyer that wanted to come in.&quot;</p>
<p>While a few serials remained, some term bonds were three times oversubscribed, Devane said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there is going to be any hang over,&quot; he said. &quot;The bonds will be going away probably by Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>The deal was on somewhat of a tight time schedule, Devane said. It was slotted for late August, he said, adding that frames are set to keep state appropriation deals from running too close together.</p>
<p>However, because an illness at the City University of New York system delayed a quorem until Monday morning, the preliminary offering statement could not be released until Monday afternoon, Devane said.</p>
<p>The Authority asked lead manager Smith Barney to give retail buyers priority, and to help identify them, the underwriter asked that zip codes accompany such orders, Devane said.</p>
