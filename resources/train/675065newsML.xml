<p>Striking nickel miners at Inco Ltd's Sudbury, Ontario operations said on Friday they were waiting to hear from the company about their contract proposal after rejecting an Inco offer on Thursday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for local 6500 of The United Steelworkers of America told Reuters that union leaders representing the 4,670 striking miners rejected a counterproposal from Inco and said they awaited a call on an earlier union offer.</p>
<p>&quot;If they want to talk to us, they know where we are,&quot; said Kevin Conley, spokesman for local 6500.</p>
<p>Local 6500 chief negotiator Wayne Fraser said in a statement that the union believed Inco &quot;dropped the ball&quot; by ignoring the concerns raised in the offer presented by the union to a provincial mediator on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The company's response, presented to the union last night, was an arrogant insult. It responded to only one issue -- wages -- and tied benefits concessions to their proposal that they never even discussed in bargaining, and that they had to know would be unacceptable to the union&quot;, Fraser said.</p>
<p>Inco's unionized Sudbury workers went on strike at midnight on June 2, after voting 60.4 percent against a contract offer endorsed by union leaders.</p>
<p>According to Inco's 1997 production plan, the Ontario division was expected to produce about 230 million pounds of nickel, about 200 million pounds of copper and about four million pounds of cobalt.</p>
<p>Inco's Port Colborne, Ontario refinery, which processes cobalt, precious metals and electro-nickel, was not affected by the Sudbury strike. Unionized workers at the Port Colborne refinery approved the contract on June 2.</p>
