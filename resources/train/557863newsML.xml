<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Friday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>--Government leaders used their May Day speeches to launch an offensive against economic crime and tax evasion. Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said that penalties were often insufficient and Justice Minister Frank Jensen said that the first step would be to close loopholes in exisiting legislation.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--Pension fund LD earned well in 1996 from its six percent holding in chemicals company Cheminova, but some investors, including an LD board member, think the fund should divest its stake if Cheminova continues to sell pesticides banned in Denmark to developing countries.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS-POSTEN</p>
<p>--Rasmussen's May Day speech sounded as if taken from the mouth of a conservative. It was the modern social democrat's speech, vintage 1997, echoing the style of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. In one phrase he spoke of Denmark as &quot;the soft country with a hard currency.&quot;</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--The pensions industry is complaining that the government's plan to increase gross tax will hurt the 1.5 million Danes with capital pensions. One company said that a doubling of the tax rate would take 10 percent off the value of a pension.</p>
<p>--EU competition authorities will decide today if Carlsberg may go ahead with plans to produce, distribute and sell Coca Cola in the Nordic region.</p>
<p>--After pressure from the Danish Data Association and big businesses Tele Danmark has lowered rates on leased international lines.</p>
<p>DET FRI AKTUELT</p>
<p>--House prices will continue to rise, even if the government goes ahead with plans to further reduce tax relief on mortgage interest payments.</p>
