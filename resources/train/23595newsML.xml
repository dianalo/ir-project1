<p>Canadian 88 Energy Corp, flush from its successful wildcat natural gas well in the Alberta foothills, should be producing over triple its current output by the end of 1997, company president and chief executive Greg Noval said on Friday.</p>
<p>Canadian 88, which currently produces about 75 million cubic feet per day of gas, should be able to boost its output to 240 MMCFD after several more wells and a gas plant expansion, Noval tld Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, by the end of '97,&quot; Noval said when asked about the figure, which was forecast by analysts earlier this week.  </p>
<p>The company's stock was ignited this week after it announced its much-watched, 4.0-km-deep Waterton prospect, a well that will likely carry a final price tag of C$7 million, encountered &quot;significant&quot; gas reserves.</p>
<p>Canadian 88 said it would also drill deeper than its target Mississippian geological formation to gauge the presense of gas in the Devonian.</p>
<p>Noval said his company estimated reserves in the Mississippian to reach 300 billion cubic feet per day. Another 200 BCF could be harbored deeper, based on similar wells in the region, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've been blessed,&quot; Noval said. &quot;It's a knockout punch.&quot;</p>
<p>Current plans for Waterton include completing a 3D seismic program on its lands and drilling four more wells in the area, he said. Each were expected to yield about 20 MMCFD.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a possibility here, according to what the seismic's shown us so far, of upwards of 100 million a day of production here. So, it's a gas field, it's not a one-well wonder, we don't think,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other factors expected to boost production include a plant expansion and more drilling at Carstairs and Olds-Crossfield, north of Calgary. Together, the plans would increase the company's output from those areas to 140 MMCFD, he said.</p>
<p>Projects are expected to be financed by a just-signed line of credit valued at C$80 million, Noval said. -- Reuters Calgary Bureau 403 531-1624</p>
