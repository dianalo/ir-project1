<p>Israel's defence minister said on Thursday the Jewish state would have &quot;no difficulty&quot; retaking West Bank towns handed to the Palestinians in a self-rule deal but did not want to send in troops.</p>
<p>In the West Bank town of Hebron Israeli troops wounded seven Palestinians with rubber bullets in the latest round of clashes, witnesses said. Israeli troops and settlers killed three Palestinians in Hebron on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be no difficulty recapturing Hebron or any other city but we don't want to do that,&quot; said Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, referring to eight Palestinian towns handed over to self-rule since a landmark 1993 peace agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the Palestinians to honour the agreements so we can make progress in the process and reach a solution without dangers and threats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We wish Mr Mordechai would stop issuing such empty threats. Entering (Palestinian cities) would not be easy,&quot; said Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, secretary-general of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Street battles have flared nearly every day since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent bulldozers on March 18 to start work on a Jewish settlement on an Arab East Jerusalem hill called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic.</p>
<p>Top Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas set off for Washington on Wednesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and special envoy Dennis Ross on launching an eagerly anticipated U.S. peace initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;The minute Netanyahu announces a halt to all settlement activities, including in Jabal Abu Ghneim...he would have actually declared his commitment to the peace process,&quot; Erekat told Israel television.</p>
<p>Palestinians see the settlement as an attempt to pre-empt future talks on the status of East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967. Israel says it can build where it likes in the city it calls its &quot;eternal&quot; capital.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who left for Europe after a brief visit home from crisis talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday, said the only path out of the crisis was a PLO crackdown on militants to prevent attacks such as a March 21 Tel Aviv suicide bombing that killed three Israeli women.</p>
<p>&quot;The first principle that President Clinton and I discussed and agreed upon is that there must be an absolute condemnation and battle against terrorism on the Palestinian side because this is the first condition...of peace,&quot; Netanyahu told visiting foreign mayors on Wednesday.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Palestinian security chiefs refused a request by U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Israeli security officials at a secret meeting attended by President Yasser Arafat in Gaza on Tuesday to restore security ties with Israel.</p>
<p>Israel said after the Tel Aviv bombing it would put political talks on hold until the PLO strengthened security cooperation against &quot;terror&quot;.</p>
<p>The PLO insists security and political talks must go hand in hand: &quot;Without there being any progress in the political direction there can be no coordination,&quot; Palestinian West Bank Preventive Security Chief Jibril Rajoub told Israel Television.</p>
