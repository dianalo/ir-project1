<p>Swedish Central Bank governor Urban Backstrom said on Saturday he personally believed it would be positive for Sweden to join Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) but stressed that such a move was not topical now.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the time is ready to start discussing this issue because Sweden has become an increasingly stable country,&quot; he told Reuters during a European Union meeting in Dublin on a future single currency for Europe.</p>
<p>Backstrom was referring to a domestic economic situation with low inflation and a reduced budget deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should form an opinion in Sweden that we should join at a later stage,&quot; he said. He declined to discuss any timetable for possible ERM entry.</p>
<p>However, Backstrom added, &quot;The matter is not topical now&quot; and stressed that he did not want to create the impression that Sweden was preparing a decision to join the ERM, which currently groups 10 of the EU's 15 currencies.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Erik Asbrink took a more cautious line on the issue, saying the current Swedish monetary policy, which is aimed at keeping inflation down, was working well.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pursuing a monetary and foreign exchange policy which has been very successful,&quot; Asbrink told reporters, like Backstrom stressing that ERM entry was not on the agenda.</p>
<p>But, Asbrink added, &quot;We have not ruled out that possibility in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swedish crown is floating on currency markets since the autumn of 1992, a victim of European currency turmoil.</p>
<p>Backstrom said it was important to have support in the Swedish society for any decision to join ERM. &quot;We will see how that discussion is developing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Backstrom noted that there were critical voices in the current Swedish debate about ERM and he suggested that Sweden could not join the mechanism if there was strong opposition.</p>
<p>Asked whether he believed ERM membership would be desirable or a positive step, he said, &quot;Yes. Otherwise I would not have raised the issue.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to a speech he made on Thursday in Stockholm where he said ERM membership could confirm increased economic stability in Sweden and also show that it would continue to pursue policies aimed at economic stability.</p>
<p>Backstrom said ERM membership could increase the freedom of action for the Swedish parliament when it decides in the autumn of 1997 whether to join economic and monetary union (EMU), both if it opted for or against membership.</p>
<p>Separately, Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto refused to comment on when and whether his country may join the ERM.</p>
<p>Niinisto said on Saturday the issue had not been discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>The Finnish government, determined to be among the first group of countries to join monetary union in 1999, has repeatedly said it will decide this autumn whether to join ERM.</p>
