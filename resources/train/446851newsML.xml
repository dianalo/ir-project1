<p>At least five inmates died and 40 others were hurt on Monday during a prison riot in the southern city of Oaxaca, the state government said.</p>
<p>Televisa television network put the death toll as high as eight but this could not be confirmed immediately. It showed images of blood-covered inmates being carried out of the prison gates, looking battered and bewildered.</p>
<p>National radio network Radio Red quoted Oaxaca state Attorney General Roberto Pedro Martinez as saying tensions were running so high that guards were still unable to enter the jail six hours after the fighting broke out. It said 15 of the wounded were in serious condition.</p>
<p>The state government said the revolt was the result of a power struggle in the Santa Maria Ixcotel jail between two groups of inmates. Prison authorities managed to evacuate the 40 wounded, who were immediately taken to a hospital.</p>
<p>Benjamin Soriano, spokesman for the Mexican League for the Defence of Human Rights in Oaxaca, told Reuters a group of Indian peasants arrested last year and held in the jail on charges of belonging to the rebel Popular Revolutionary Army were not involved in the uprising.</p>
