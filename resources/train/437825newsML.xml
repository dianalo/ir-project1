<p>The New Zealand dollar will remain overvalued for most of 1997 while interest rates rise, an official with the U.N. Joint Staff Pension Fund said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cheikh Mbaye, New York-based investment management assistant at the fund, said in an interview at the New Zealand Investment Conference that the country's economy was well-managed and its fundamentals were strong.  </p>
<p>The current account deficit was not putting any downward pressure on the currency and would not become a major concern to offshore investors unless it grew to over 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point in time, looking at the fundamentals of the economy, if the New Zealand economy picks up and interest rates are raised, I don't see the overvaluation coming down,&quot; said Mbaye, whose fund was ranked 45th with assets of US$16.2 billion in a January survey of the top 200 U.S. pension funds.  </p>
<p>He added: &quot;Even if interest rates are raised also in the U.S., which is not very likely, at least in the first half of 1997, the New Zealand dollar would remain for the good part of 1997 overvalued. I don't see it coming down at all, to be honest.&quot;</p>
<p>Mbaye said that if the RBNZ's economic projections on Thursday forecast positive growth in the New Zealand economy, the currency would either remain at current levels or move higher.  </p>
<p>He declined to specify by how much the currency was overvalued, but U.S. investment house Goldman Sachs has recently suggested 15 percent.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) governor Don Brash has reiterated that he would prefer a lower currency and higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Mbaye said Brash might get half of what he wanted, as the trend for lower interest rates in New Zealand was definitely over.  </p>
<p>&quot;The next trend is probably going to be an increase in the rates...In the second half of the year we should start to see yields go up. The market will ultimately dictate what the right level is,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mbaye said the widening of New Zealand's target band for underlying inflation to 0-3 percent from 0-2 percent was not of concern.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been actually edging over two percent anyway when the band was 0-2. So therefore 0-3 is just recognising the fact that it was very difficult to keep it in that narrow range.&quot;</p>
