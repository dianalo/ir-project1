<p>K-III Communications Corp, in a move to pare debt and refocus its business, said Tuesday it would shed non-core operations and offer an additional 12.5 million shares of its common stock in a public sale.</p>
<p>The New York-based owner of the Channel One educational channel and specialty consumer magazines like Seventeen and Soap Opera Digest, could fetch anywhere from $250 million to $350 million from the sale of its non-core assets, analysts said. It could raise another $150 million through an offering of its stock, which fell 1/2 to 12-1/8 late Tuesday.  </p>
<p>K-III will use the proceeds to reduce its roughly $2 billion in debt and outstanding preferred stock, measures analysts said would surely boost the company's current BB- and BA3 credit ratings.</p>
<p>Aiming for a growth rate of at least twice U.S. Gross Domestic Product growth, K-III said it would target six main areas: workplace learning; classroom learning; specialty consumer magazines; technical and trade magazines; consumer directories and business directories.</p>
<p>It said it would sell businesses it considers non-core, in markets which fell below its targeted growth rate.  </p>
<p>Businesses slated for sale include the Daily Racing Form (with Pro-Football Weekly), Newbridge Book Clubs, New Woman Magazine and Krames Communications, as well as the Katherine Gibbs School, whose sale K-III announced last October.</p>
<p>The company derived about $260 million of its $1.37 billion in revenues from those businesses, or about $24 million in cash flow.</p>
<p>Analysts said the moves will make K-III a more tightly focused company after the sales and could help it concentrate on growing through small acquisitions to its six newly defined core areas.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's some of the best news we've seen come out of K-III in a long time,&quot; said Jacob Barker, who follows K-III's bonds for NationsBank. &quot;You'll see a significant inprovement in their credit risk after this.&quot;</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts after Tuesday's announcement, K-III said it expects to achieve a 15 percent overall annual growth rate going forward as a result of the moves, and that half of that growth would come internally, without acquisitions.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company was likely to achieve those estimates. They said that for shareholders, those growth prospects outweight any negative in the company potentially diluting its share price with a higher float, or more common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>K-III had about 134 million common shares outstanding as of January 30, when it announced its 1996 fourth-quarter and year-end results. After the 12.5 million share offering, slated for April, the company will have just under 150 million shares.</p>
