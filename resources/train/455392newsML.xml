<p>South Africa go into the third and final test against Australia at Centurion Park on Friday staring down the barrel of their first home series whitewash this century.</p>
<p>Hansie Cronje's men trail Australia 2-0 after defeats in Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth and a third defeat would link them with the South African side of 1898/99.</p>
<p>They lost a three test home series to Lord Hawke's touring MCC team since when South Africa have managed to avoid the ignominy of losing all tests in a home series.</p>
<p>&quot;If we lose three-nil, we lose three-nil -- that's the reality -- it's not a fear,&quot; said South Africa coach Bob Woolmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully we will get one back but Australia are a good side. The reality is that their number four and five batsmen share 140 tests between them and you can add all our caps together as many times as you like and you won't get that number.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a very talented team but at test match level we are still short of experience.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa will chose from a squad of 13 with the balance of the side affected by the fact that all-rounder Brian McMillan may be unable to bowl because of a heel injury.</p>
<p>McMillan will probably play purely as a batsman and may be promoted from his usual number seven to number three as South Africa contemplate rejigging their fragile batting order.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't finalised that yet,&quot; said Woolmer. &quot;But you can pontificate about systems and batting orders until the cows come home but the only thing that we need is for our young batters to fire.&quot;</p>
<p>With Shaun Pollock absent with a hamstring strain either Lance Klusener or left arm fast bowler Brett Schultz is likely to come in as a straight replacement in the one certain change to the X1 which lost in Port Elizabeth on Monday.</p>
<p>Australia's greatest enemy may be complacency. After clinching their recent hone series with West Indies they lost the fifth test by ten wickets inside three days at Perth.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be disappointing to perform badly at Centurion Park but there is always that danger,&quot; admitted skipper Mark Taylor.</p>
<p>&quot;Port Elizabeth was a big win and it is going to be hard to get the guys up again. Very hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Australia won a low-scoring match in Port Elizabeth after South Africa had held a 188-run lead with ten second innings wickets in hand at one point.</p>
<p>&quot;We showed we are a pretty good cricket team after being down and out at one point in Port Elizabeth,&quot; added Taylor.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the last two test matches we have won the really big days.&quot;</p>
<p>Taylor's position as opening batsman has been under pressure as his poor run of form has continued. He has failed to reach 50 in his last 18 test innings and has not even reached 20 in his last nine. However, he reiterated he would open the innings one again.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Glenn McGrath is still struggling with a strained muscle in the sole of his left foot but will probably play. However he is likely to miss the subsequent seven match one day international series in order to return home and rest.</p>
<p>Australia are expected to field an unchanged team.</p>
<p>Squads:</p>
<p>South Africa (from) - Gary Kirsten, Adam Bacher, Jacques Kallis, Daryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Brian McMillan, Dave Richardson, Lance Klusener, Allan Donald, Paul Adams, Brett Schultz, Pat Symcox.</p>
<p>Australia (from) - Mark Taylor (captain), Matthew Hayden, Matthew Elliott, Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh, Greg Blewett, Michael Bevan, Ian Healy, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Paul Reiffel.</p>
