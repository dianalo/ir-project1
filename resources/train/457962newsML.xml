<p>Asia's diesel market is jittery as about 800,000 tonnes of Russian and Middle East cargoes are due to arrive soon but sellers are putting up a brave front as prices remained supported, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we are concerned that prices might fall when these cargoes arrive,&quot; one western trader said. &quot;But it does not necessarily mean that we will divert the cargoes elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>He said those cargoes have been fixed based on projection of the market condition and arbitrage economics for April.</p>
<p>Based on current Singapore swaps prices for April, the East/West spread at $21.00 per tonne continued to make the arbitrage workable, despite slipping from over $30.00 at the peak of the rally in Asia.</p>
<p>Traders said over 500,000 tonnes of Russian diesel are due to arrive from end March and early April, and at least another 200,000 tonnes from the Middle East.</p>
<p>Traders had earlier feared that these arbitrage cargoes would glut the Asian market. But sentiment is now more upbeat as prices remained boosted by a Singapore trader who has so far bought over three million barrels since the start of March.</p>
<p>They said this could be one reason why middle-distillate stocks plunged by 985,000 barrels to 5.8 million barrels for the week ending March 19, as the trader stored the diesel he bought on very large crude carriers (VLCC), anchored outside Singapore.</p>
<p>The market has tried in vain to second guess when the trader would cease buying, raising concerns that the market would slump if he did so when the cargoes actually arrived.</p>
<p>Some players said the local trader might need to buy another one million barrels of diesel and would remain in the market until the end of the month.</p>
<p>This has encouraged several sellers to offer mid-April lifting cargoes at high levels of between $28.05 and $28.70 per barrel, free-on-board (fob) basis on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But traders also noted that while the local trader made a bid on Wednesday, they did not make any purchases.</p>
<p>Traders said prices could fall to its support of $25.00 when the trader finally pulled out from the diesel market and shifts his focus to the fuel oil market.</p>
<p>One trader noted that there is &quot;quite a bit of gap between what Hin Leong is doing&quot;, which is helping to support prices, &quot;and the paper value.&quot; Swaps gas oil for April was quoted on Thursday at $26.20/$26.40 a barrel, down 40 cents.</p>
<p>Hin Leong on Tuesday paid $28.60 per barrel for an early April cargo.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, traders who are bringing in the arbitrage cargoes said they could not divert them to the U.S. as the market there is also &quot;flushed&quot; with diesel.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever that has been fixed will be on the way here,&quot; another western trader said.</p>
<p>These traders are looking to sell into Hong Kong, which were keen to buy cheaper arbitrage cargoes rather than from Singapore, as well as into India especially during second half April and early May.</p>
<p>Indonesia would also be home for some of the cargoes from the Middle East, traders said.</p>
<p>They also noted that when prices slip to its support level, China might be motivated to buy.</p>
<p>China has indicated that it would not buy any diesel for the second quarter. But traders said it might buy less due to high international prices and relatively lower domestic prices, rather than completely ceasing imports.</p>
