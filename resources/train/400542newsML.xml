<headline>LIFFE coffee see-saws to close up, NY gains eyed.</headline>

<p>London robusta coffee futures fluctuated but managed to close with pared gains after a late New York-inspired rally which helped reignited activity was not sustained, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;London was struggling for volume until New York started to move sharply,&quot; said one trader. Traders said the New York market took a spike higher after one major roaster was seen buying heavily into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;This sparked some short covering in London, pulling the market higher,&quot; he said. But there was new fundamental news behind the rise.</p>
<p>London's May was driven to a session high of $1,561 a tonne but settled back at $1,545, still $17 higher.</p>
<p>Earlier, the contract spent the morning in negative territory, trading near the significant $1,500 support on origin hedge selling notably from the Far East.</p>
<p>But the slide towards $1,500 was met by good industry buying support.</p>
<p>Overall volume was 6,363 lots, dominated by AA trades in May and some crosses in March.</p>
<p>Chart-wise, analysts said coffee's recent uptrend could be coming to an end if the market makes enough of an attack on support.</p>
<p>The critical support on May coffee started at $1,500 and went down to around $1,430, Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Gifford noted particular support at around $1,465. &quot;If that goes, I'd be inclined to abandon upside targets and assume the whole move was going to be reversed,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Some traders thought the market was probably taking a pause after a near two-month bull run which took prices some 40-45 percent higher.</p>
<p>But they would not speculate on where it is heading next. &quot;It's difficult to say where we go from here but I don't think it is picking up further steam again,&quot; said one physical trader.</p>
