<p>The Supreme Court, in a decision that significantly broadens police powers, ruled on Wednesday that officers may order passengers to get out of a vehicle during a routine traffic stop.</p>
<p>The court, by a 7-2 vote, sided with Maryland and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who argued in support of the state. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for the majority, noted that the high court had held in 1977 that a police officer may order the driver of a lawfully stopped car to exit the vehicle and said the same police powers extend to passengers as well.</p>
<p>He rejected the argument that the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures prohibit police from ordering passengers out of cars during routine checks without grounds to suspect a crime has been committed.</p>
<p>The two dissenting justices warned the ruling will affect &quot;millions of other cases&quot; across the nation and objected to &quot;routine and arbitrary seizures of obviously innocent citizens.&quot;</p>
<p>Rehnquist cited the public interest in police safety and said the extra intrusion on the privacy interests of passengers would be &quot;minimal&quot; by forcing them to get out of the car.</p>
<p>The case involved Jerry Lee Wilson, who was ordered out of a car during a routine police stop in Baltimore County and was arrested when some crack cocaine fell to the ground. Wilson had sought to supress the drug evidence.</p>
<p>Rehnquist sought to justify the ruling based on police safety, saying 5,762 officers were assaulted and 11 killed in 1994 during traffic stops and pursuits. On privacy rights, he acknowledged police have a stronger case in ordering the driver, who may have committed a minor traffic offence, to get out.</p>
<p>&quot;But as a practical matter, the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle,&quot; he said, adding that the only change was that they would be denied access to any weapon that might be concealed in the car.</p>
<p>Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony Kennedy issued strongly worded dissents.</p>
<p>&quot;How far this groundbreaking decision will take us, I do not venture to predict. I fear, however, that it may pose a more serious threat to individual liberty than the court realises,&quot; Stevens said.</p>
<p>Kennedy warned that the court &quot;puts tens of millions of passengers at risk of arbitrary control by the police.&quot;</p>
