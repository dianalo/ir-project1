<p>After a week of angry nationwide protests, Iranian leaders appear keen to contain damage in a row with Germany over a Berlin court's verdict that Tehran ordered political killings, Iranian analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Despite the demonstrations against last Thursday's verdict, they said, Tehran seemed committed to repairing its ties with Germany and other European Union states in the face of U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>&quot;The protests are a natural reaction to the court's accusations which Iran sees as an affront to its top leaders,&quot; one analyst said. &quot;But demonstrators, state media and officials have actually mainly targeted the United States and Israel as instigators of the row.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not just rhetoric. It is the Iranians' way of restating their foreign policy priorities and of saying they want to save their ties with Europe to better counter their main enemies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>EU states, except Greece, have recalled their ambassadors from Iran for consultations after the court verdict which said Iranian leaders had ordered the 1992 killings of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin. Tehran, which has repeatedly denied all involvement, said it would reciprocate.</p>
<p>The demonstrations, widely publicised in state media, have included four marches to the German embassy in Tehran and dozens of protests across Iran.</p>
<p>The protests continued on Thursday, with veterans disabled in Iraqi chemical attacks in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war holding a sit-in outside the German embassy in Tehran and half a dozen demonstrations across Iran, state-run Tehran radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Tehran might lower the level of its trade with Germany, as it has in recent years, and choose to deal more with countries it sees as more friendly,&quot; another analyst said.</p>
<p>Germany, Iran's main trading partner for over a decade, has been recently overtaken by Italy. Bilateral trade fell to 3.3 billion marks ($1.9 billion) last year from 8.2 billion marks five years earlier.</p>
<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday blamed the row on the United States and Israel, but said Germany would pay a &quot;high price&quot; for its mistakes.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not see any basic difference between what Ayatollah Khamenei said and Velayati's remarks a few days earlier. Of course, Khamenei's wording is stronger because he is addressing the local population,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati last week urged EU states not to jeopardise their interests in Iran and said Tehran would plan its future policy towards each country based on the state's actions during the present row.</p>
<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has also said the row was instigated by Israel and Washington, but added that it was a &quot;passing storm&quot;.</p>
<p>The United States has repeatedly urged EU states to join economic sanctions it has imposed on Iran, which it accuses of sponsoring terrorism. Tehran denies the charges and says Washington is bent on overthrowing its Islamic government for opposing U.S. hegemony in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Tehran has in the past year warmed up to Paris, with Iranian officials and media praising France's independent policy in the Middle East and saying Paris should have a greater role in the region to counter U.S. influence.</p>
<p>Analysts said the row might boost the chances for Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a conservative candidate vying for the presidency. His main opponent in the May 23 poll appears to be Mohammad Khatami, who is backed by groups including pro-Rafsanjani centrists. Both candidates are Shi'ite clerics.</p>
<p>&quot;Anytime there is a foreign threat against Iran, hardliners get wind in their sails,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
