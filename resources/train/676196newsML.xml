<p>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., hit by an investigation of its sales practices, on Friday settled a class-action lawsuit by offering the holders of 3.7 million policies about $350 million.</p>
<p>The settlement will offer policyholders who bought insurance from 1979 to 1996 a &quot;wide array of relief and benefits,&quot; John Hancock said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some customers, although still getting significant value from their policies, may not have received all they had hoped for,&quot; Hancock Chief Executive Stephen Brown said in a statement. &quot;Through this settlement, we have the opportunity to recognise and rectify that situation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Boston-based insurance company, the ninth-largest in the country, also said it was in talks with the Massachusetts Division of Insurance and regulators from other states about allegations of deceptive sales practices.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been talking about them with the (insurance) commissioner's office and regulators from a number of other states for many months now, and we will continue to do so until this is resolved,&quot; Hancock said.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Division of Insurance said it recently began a broad investigation of Hancock's sales practices and was seeking company documents on disciplinary actions against its agents over the past 18 years.</p>
<p>Michael Goetz, a spokesman for the state insurance division, said the investigation was in the early stages and covered the same allegations as in the class-action lawsuit.</p>
<p>Specifically, the suit alleged and officials were investigating a deceptive sales practice known as churning, or twisting, marketing life insurance as an investment and policies that include so-called vanishing premiums.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made a very substantial request of them to provide us all of the names of agents they have disciplined,&quot; Goetz said. The agency has also requested sales marketing literature and procedural manuals for training agents.</p>
<p>&quot;The purpose of that is so that we can go through it and see whether it bears out allegations of unfair conduct,&quot; he said. &quot;They've indicated a willingness to cooperate with our investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>The investigation of John Hancock is just the latest shadow cast over the insurance industry. The Prudential Insurance Co. of America could end up paying more than $2.5 billion to policyholders to settle class-action lawsuits alleging that the company engaged in deceptive sales practices.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York Life Insurance Co. and Allianz Life Insurance Co. of North America all have been involved in similar actions in the last two years.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the years, the company has taken a number of major steps to crack down on inappropriate sales activity as well as individual agents who tried to operate outside the rules,&quot; Hancock's Brown said.</p>
<p>The company said the settlement will have &quot;no material impact&quot; on its financial health.</p>
<p>Under the deal, which is subject to approval of the U.S. District Court in Boston, Hancock will offer policyholders cash contributions, low interest loans, reimbursement for some charges and other relief.</p>
<p>Policyholders may also choose to have their claims considered through an alternative dispute resolution process, Hancock said.</p>
