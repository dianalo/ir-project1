<p>South Africa and Mozambique signed a three billion rand contract on Monday with a French-led consortium to build a toll road linking the Mozambican capital Maputo with the town of Witbank northeast of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The highway is the first key infrastructure project in the Maputo Development Corridor agreement, signed by South African President Nelson Mandela and his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano in May last year.</p>
<p>South African deputy president Thabo Mbeki, who witnessed the Monday's signing, said it was the first project of its kind in southern Africa &quot;and indeed one of only a few privately financed cross-border toll roads in the world&quot;.</p>
<p>The French-led concessionaire, Trans African Concessions (TRAC), will start work within six months, South African Transport Minister Mac Maharaj, who signed the deal on behalf of South Africa, said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aiming at completion after 18 months,&quot; Maharaj said.</p>
<p>He added that the contract was for three billion rands over 30 years.</p>
<p>Mbeki explained: &quot;The concession is a period of 30 years, in which the operations and maintenance of the road will be performed by the concessionaire.</p>
<p>&quot;The road will be transferred to the governments with a future design life of about 15 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said the presence of a French company as majority shareholder indicated the confidence of international partners in the transformation of the region, from one of risk and conflict &quot;into an area of business and future&quot;.</p>
<p>Mocumbi also announced that final procedures were under way for the launch of tenders for new concessions in the port of Maputo and the railway line between Maputo and South Africa.</p>
