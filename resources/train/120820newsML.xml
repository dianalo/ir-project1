<p>The United Nations body charged with compensating Gulf War victims said on Wednesday it had told Iraq only the Security Council could make a decision on its request for funds to mount a legal defence against claims.</p>
<p>The U.N. Compensation Commission, whose Governing Council ended a two-day meeting on Tuesday, said Iraq had been informed of the decision taken at closed-door talks.</p>
<p>The Commission, set up by the Security Council to compensate direct losses caused by Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, is processing private, corporate and government claims against Baghdad with an asserted value of more than $200 billion.</p>
<p>Iraqi deputy foreign minister Riyadh al-Qaysi made the request to the Governing Council, composed of the same 15 member states as the Security Council, last July. He said Baghdad did not have the money for lawyers, due to international sanctions.</p>
<p>In its statement, the Geneva-based Commission said that the Council agreed that Iraq continued to be &quot;welcome to participate effectively in the work of the UNCC in a manner consistent with the relevant decisions of the Security Council&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;With regard to the requests submitted by the Government of Iraq dealing with the Security Council's establishment of the UNCC, including its structure and composition, and the use of the U.N. Compensation Fund, the Council considered that those were matters within the sole competence of the Security Council,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the U.N. reparations body announced it had completed assessing claims for damages filed against Baghdad by one million people who were forced to leave Kuwait or Iraq due to Iraq's occupation of the oil-rich emirate in 1991-92.</p>
<p>Carlos Alzamora, executive secretary, said the Commission faced a dramatic funding shortage and was unable to pay out awards this year, mainly due to a delay in implementing a scheme to allow Iraq to sell some oil abroad. Under the deal, the fund would receive 30 per cent of limited Iraqi oil revenues.</p>
