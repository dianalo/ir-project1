<p>Monaco popped the champagne corks after wrapping up the French title but Manchester United and Rangers were forced to put their celebrations on ice at the weekend.</p>
<p>United were held 2-2 by Leicester in the English premier league on Saturday, while Celtic beat Hibernian 3-1 on Sunday to deny Rangers a night of celebrations.</p>
<p>Juventus's campaign for Italy's serie A title wavered when they were held to a 0-0 draw by Sampdoria.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich remained three clear at the top of the German league after salvaging a 3-3 draw against 1860 Munich despite being reduced to nine men.</p>

<p>France</p>
<p>Bordeaux helped Monaco win their first French league title since 1988 when they held Paris St Germain to a 2-2 draw at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.</p>
<p>Caen prevented Monaco from celebrating their title in style when they held the team from the principality to a 2-2 draw at home on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was the sixth title for Monaco, who won their first 36 years ago.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>Manchester United's title celebrations were put on hold after they could only draw 2-2 at Leicester.</p>
<p>Arsenal's title hopes disappeared when they lost 1-0 at home to Newcastle but Liverpool kept their chances alive by coming from behind to beat Tottenham 2-1.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Parma injected some life into the Italian title race on Sunday, coming back to beat Atalanta 2-1 and move within four points of leaders Juventus who were held 0-0 at home by Sampdoria.</p>
<p>The victory kept alive Parma's hopes of overhauling the Turin club and significantly boosted their chances of finishing second and thus earning a place in next season's European Cup.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Bayern Munich missed the chance to go five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday, salvaging a 3-3 draw with local rivals 1860 Munich thanks only to a Carsten Jancker goal two minutes from time.</p>
<p>Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 with hosts Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>Real Madrid shook off their internal problems and an early goal from Sporting Gijon to score a convincing 3-1 win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Davor Suker ended his goal drought to find the net twice, and set-piece specialist Roberto Carlos thundered home another as Real took a provisional 11-point lead over Barcelona who play on Monday.</p>
<p>The Netherlands</p>
<p>Argentine striker Pablo Sanchez scored both goals as Feyenoord beat NAC Breda 2-0 on Sunday to move to the top of the Dutch first division.</p>
<p>Feyenoord have 69 points, one more than PSV Eindhoven, who did not play this weekend but could regain top spot on Wednesday when they play Sparta Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Scotland</p>
<p>Celtic's desperate bid to deny Glasgow rivals Rangers a ninth successive Scottish league title extended a further 24 hours on Sunday when they beat Hibernian 3-1.</p>
<p>Rangers will be crowned champions on Monday if they take just one point from their game against Motherwell.</p>
