<p>Troops loyal to Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov battled a mutinous government commander on Monday, firing artillery and rockets at his positions south of Dushanbe.</p>
<p>Near the village of Leur, 18 km (12 miles) south of the Tajik capital, puffs of smoke rose from the crest of a mountain as Rakhmonov's presidential guard unleashed shells and rockets every few minutes at forces belonging to maverick colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev.</p>
<p>Fighting in Dushanbe itself died down on Sunday after forces under Tajik interior ministry commander Sukhrob Kasimov seized a northern district from a rival warlord.</p>
<p>Civilians and private transport were back on the streets on Monday.</p>
<p>But Khudoyberdyev, commander of an elite government armoured brigade in the south of the ex-Soviet republic, seized on the unrest that erupted in Dushanbe on Saturday to advance his own, as yet murky, political ambitions.</p>
<p>&quot;It was quiet overnight, but we started fighting at about 8.30 am (0330 GMT),&quot; a weary commander in charge of a ragged collection of soldiers in Leur told Reuters.</p>
<p>Fighting was also going on in Shakhrinau, 20 km (12 miles) west of Dushanbe, Russian military sources said. Local volunteers seen as supporting Khodoyberdyev had taken up arms against presidential forces, they said.</p>
<p>Russia has around 20,000 troops in the central Asian state who carry out peacekeeping duties and guard the borders of what Moscow has called its strategic underbelly. They are seen as Rakhmonov's guarantors.</p>
<p>Small armed posts belonging to the peacekeepers have appeared near many of the defensive posts set up by the presidential guard, but Rakhmonov's spokesman said on Monday they had not been asked for help.</p>
<p>&quot;The question of asking for Russian help is not being considered,&quot; Zafar Saidov said by telephone.</p>
<p>The fighting occurred only weeks after Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with armed Islamic opposition guerrillas aimed at ending a four-year civil war in the country, which borders Afghanistan.</p>
