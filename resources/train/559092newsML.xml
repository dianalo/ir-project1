<p>About 10 people died and more than a dozen were injured after three wagons came loose from a passenger train, left the track and hit a stationary goods train near Szczecin in northwest Poland on Monday, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are about 10 dead and more than a dozen wounded, but these numbers could change. Rescue operations are in progress,&quot; Szczecin police spokesman Pawel Biedziak told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Biedziak said the three wagons came uncoupled from the end of the fast train, travelling from the coastal town of Swinoujscie to Krakow in the south, at about 12.25 p.m. (1025 GMT) and struck the goods train on a nearby line.</p>
<p>He said he had no details yet of the identity or nationality of the victims of the accident at the small station of Reptowo near Stargard Szczecinski, south of Szczecin and not far from the German border.</p>
<p>The injured were rushed to hospitals in Stargard and Szczecin, and police appealed to drivers in the area to make way for speeding emergency vehicles. -- Anthony Barker +48 22 653 9700</p>
