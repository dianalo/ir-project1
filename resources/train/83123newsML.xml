<headline>Text of Rubin remarks following G7 meeting.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-09-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following is the text of U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's prepared remarks to a news conference following Saturday's meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial countries:</p>
<p>&quot;Good afternoon. Let me give you a quick summary of the conclusions of our discussion today on the world economic outlook and the initiatives we have under way to deal with the major challenges in the world economy and financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;First, on the world economy, the general sense around the table was that the outlook had improved since our last meeting and that conditions appear to be in place for a strengthening and broadening of the expansion of the world economy into 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout the G7 countries, inflation remains at low levels, efforts are underway to reduce fiscal deficits and external imbalances have receded.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't find it surprising to hear that we all reaffirmed the importance of continuing to direct policies toward sustaining non-inflationary growth. We recognize this requires credible programs to reduce fiscal deficits in a medium-term context, successful anti-inflationary policies, and strengthened structural reforms.  </p>
<p>&quot;We also, let me add, had a very useful discuussion about progress toward European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcomed developments in exchange markets over the recent period. And we reaffirmed our standing commitment to reduce imbalances and to cooperate closely in the exchange markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We then turned to a review of the considerable work underway to strengthen the global financial system.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcomed the progress on the reforms proposed by the G7 Heads at the Halifax Summit, in particular the strides made towards concluding the New Arrangements to Borrow.</p>
<p>&quot;And we agreed to work closely with appropriate international bodies and authorities over the coming months to develop further measures to deal with risks to the operation of the global financial market, particularly in the four areas emphasized by the Summit leaders in Lyon: cooperation among financial regulators and supervisors, internal controls and market transparency, financial systems in emerging markets, and electronic money.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to be able to welcome the launching of the multilateral debt initiative, another Halifax initiative, which is designed to provide an exit from unsustainable debt for poor and highly indebted countries that have shown a sound track record of economic adjustment.</p>
<p>&quot;We look forward to endorsing in the Interim and Development Committees this week the participation in this initiative of the International Monetary Fund, through a continuing and more concessional ESAF, and of the World Bank through Trust Funds. We are committed, together with all IMF members, to ensure the financing of a continuing ESAF, consistent with the conclusions drawn by the Managing Director.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the commitment by the World Bank to the initiative and the President's willingness to allocate an overall contribution on the order of two billion dollars. And we are pleased that, following this commitment by the IMF and the World Bank, the Paris Club for its part is ready to go beyond Naples terms in providing debt reduction of up to 80 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;Above all, the ministers look forward to the implementation without delay of all components of these decisions on a case-by-case basis. We are confident that the multilateral institutions, alongside action by other creditors, will reach decisions shortly providing an exit for countries which have demonstrated the necessary track record of adjustment.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a very useful discussion, with representatives of the European Commission and the senior Russian economic team on developments in the Russian economy and progress on economic reform.</p>
<p>&quot;We complimented Russia on its adherence to its three-year IMF program of reforms (EFF), noting in particular the significant progress made in the area of macroeconomic stabilization. We agreed on the importance of strengthening Russia's fiscal balances in consolidating stabilization gains, and on the importance of moving decisively forward on the structural reform ageda contained in the program agreed with the IMF.  </p>
<p>&quot;In addition, both sides agreed that Russia should increase its level of engagement with the World Bank in order to take advantage of the Bank's expertise in the area of structural reform.</p>
<p>&quot;The ministers noted that, following the elections in Bosnia, efforts to reconstruct Bosnia's economy must continue on developing joint economic institutions and the policies of a viable market economy. In this regard, the ministers reaffirmed the decisions of the Lyon summit to accelerate disbursements of donor pledges for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We also urged the IMF and the Bosnian authorities to engage actively with the aim of reaching early agreement on an economic stabilization and reform program, which would assist the international community in meeting Bosnia's 1997 reconstruction needs.  </p>
<p>&quot;Let me say in conclusion that we have seen over the period leading up to this meeting a remarkable series of accomplishments in the international financial system. These actions will contribute to growth in the industrial nations as well as the developing and transition economies. And they will strengthen our capacity to deal with new challenges in financial markets. All of that is very much in the interest of the United States.</p>
