<p>Gateway 2000 Inc., the computer maker, said Monday it is recalling some promotional videotapes because an unknown number apparently include about 30 seconds of sexually explicit content.</p>
<p>The videos were produced between Dec. 20 and Jan. 6, 1997.</p>
<p>Gateway said its general product video is known to have been affected. As a precaution, Gateway is also recalling its Destination promotional video.</p>
<p>Gateway said the offensive material was apparently inserted by a disgruntled employee of a video reproduction supplier, although an investigation continues.</p>
<p>Gateway said it contacted both local and federal authorities about this tampering and is cooperating fully with those agencies in their investigations.</p>
<p>A Gateway spokeswoman said the company, a direct marketer of computers, made the promotional videos available to consumers who called a toll-free number included in its advertising. The promotional videos preview Gateway's products, including its new Destination big-screen personal computer line.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the company did not know how many videos were affected by tampering.</p>
<p>She said Gateway was alerted to the problem by &quot;a handful of customers.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said individuals who received the videos from Gateway over the holidays were advised to destroy the tapes or return them to Gateway at the company's expense.</p>
<p>It said the objectionable tapes were limited to a single shipment occurring in the week following Christmas. But all tapes produced during that period were being recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;Our main concern right now is protecting our customers,&quot; said James Taylor, senior vice president of Gateway 2000. &quot;We stopped mailing tapes as soon as we learned about this and the company is now shipping tapes produced under strict controls.&quot;</p>
<p>Taylor said new, replacement tapes are being produced under the strictest security and have been shrink-wrapped with anti-tampering labels.</p>
