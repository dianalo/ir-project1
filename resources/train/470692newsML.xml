<p>Caradon Plc's chief executive Peter Jansen said on Wednesday that the UK materials group had the &quot;financial firepower&quot; to be able to afford its 174 million stg cashback, announced earlier, plus fund more acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have enough financial firepower to do everything,&quot; he said in a conference call just after the release of 1996 results which showed pretax pre-exceptional profits up 18 percent at 178.2 million. &quot;We've had a profit result at the top end of expectations and better than expected cost reductions so we are more than able to do this.&quot;  </p>
<p>He added the group was targeting possible bolt-on acquisitions in Europe. But he said that although prices may be low in Germany, in particular, there was resistance from German companies to being taken over. Jansen also said there were some buying opportunities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the poor start to the year in UK and European markets and the outlook for recovery, he said that he agreed with others in the industry that continental markets would not rebound until 1998 but that a UK rebound could show through in the second quarter.  </p>
<p>In the results statement, Caradon said 1997 had started slowly, with trading in the early months below expectations.</p>
<p>While the U.S. market looked positive, the UK was approaching recovery and continental Europe remained difficult, said the statement.</p>
