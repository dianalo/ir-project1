<p>Two privately held Philadelphia area real estate brokerage firms said Tuesday that they will merge by November 1, to form the 12th largest residential brokerage in the U.S.</p>
<p>When the merger of Roach Wheeler/Better Homes &amp; Gardens, based in Devon, Penn. and Fox &amp; Lazo Inc, based in Haddonfield N.J. becomes effective, the as-yet-unnamed new firm will have the dominant market share of residential sales in metropolitan Philadelphia, selling about 20 percent of homes in the area, said a Roach spokesman.  </p>
<p>No cash changed hands in the transaction, said the companies, which declined to disclose the ownership interests of the new firm.</p>
<p>The companies will have combined gross revenues of about $110 million, with $88 million coming from home sales and the remainder from financial services. They expect to sell about 18,000 homes worth $3.2 billion this year.</p>
<p>The principals ascribed the merger in part to their similar ways of doing business as old-line family-owned firms, and in part to accelerating consolidation in the real estate brokerage business.  </p>
<p>Today, for instance, HFS Inc, which already owns several national chains such as Coldwell Banker and Century 21, said it will buy National Realty Trust, the largest U.S. real esate brokerage firm.</p>
<p>&quot;The industry is undergoing a lot of changes and we thought we better figure out how to be a part of that change or we might not exist,&quot; said G. William Fox, Fox &amp; Lazo president and future chairman of the combined company.</p>
<p>Both firms said they have bought smaller brokerages in the past, and will make further acquistions in their market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's increaseingly difficult for small brokers to compete as brokerages get bigger,&quot; said Larry Flick, chief executive at Roach Wheeler and at the new company. &quot;But together we have the revenues to compete with the national players.&quot;</p>
<p>He cited the increasing costs of technology, flat demographic growth in metropolitan Philadelphia and increasing pressures on commissions as reasons for the merger.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is just better to grow and dominate the greater Philadelphia market,&quot; said Flick, &quot;instead of being just a part of it.&quot;</p>
