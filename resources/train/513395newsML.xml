<p>Blue-chip stocks rallied for a third day in a row on Wednesday amid reports that tobacco companies are negotiating a settlement of massive lawsuits against the industry.</p>
<p>Bonds edged lower on renewed fears of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in May, while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen after remarks by Japanese and U.S. officials raised fresh concern about central bank intervention.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 92.71 points, or 1.41 percent, at 6,679.87. The gain extended into a third session the blue chips' bounce from last week's sell-off.</p>
<p>With the gain, the Dow index has recovered 288 points, or more than 40 percent, of the nearly 700-point plunge between March 11 and April 11.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,401 to 1,038 on active volume of 499 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The news that tobacco companies were negotiating with state attorneys general to settle the massive lawsuits sparked new life into tobacco shares and helped stocks advance despite a weak performance by bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;We got off to a good start with the positive reaction to the potential tobacco settlement,&quot; said Charlie Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management. &quot;This was the first time in awhile that bonds were a touch soft and stocks were more than a touch strong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But even as blue chips were roaring ahead, many analysts focused on the broad market, which was fairly mixed.</p>
<p>Once again, technology shares failed to take part in the rally, resulting in a second consecutive decline for the Nasdaq Composite index, which ended 2.61 points lower at 1,210.27.</p>
<p>Also weaker were interest-rate sensitive groups such as banks, which met with early selling pressure after new data showed economic activity continues at a bustling pace.</p>
<p>The data included industrial output and manufacturing capacity utilization.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the kind of scenario from which bulls are born,&quot; said Dick Stein, vice president at U.S. Clearing Corp.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond was off 2/32, or 62.5 cents per $1,000 face value, sending its yield up to 7.10 percent from Tuesday's close of 7.09 percent. The price and yield move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 125.75 Japanese yen, down from 126.07 yen late Tuesday. The dollar rose to 1.7285 German marks from 1.7270 marks.</p>
<p>Coffee prices soared to a 2-1/2 year high on renewed worries about supplies for roasters this year.</p>
<p>At the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for May delivery closed at 208.05 cents a pound, up 15.65 cents or 8 percent for the day and the highest price for coffee since September 1994.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices fell sharply as a leading oil industry trade group said gasoline supplies were sufficient to meet even the most aggressive demand this spring and summer.</p>
<p>Gasoline for May delivery fell 1.52 cents to 60.38 cents, with May crude oil ending down 48 cents a barrel at $19.35 and May heating oil down 1.37 cents a gallon at 53.48 cents.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, nervous selling tied to reports of the death of an Indiana man from &quot;mad cow disease&quot; helped pushed down the price of corn, the main ingredient in cattle feed, traders said. Corn for May delivery closed down 5-1/2 cents a bushel at $2.97-1/4.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE finished 7.8 points higher at 4,294.6. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average climbed 97.61 points to close at 18,031.20.</p>
