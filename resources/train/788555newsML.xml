<p>The performance of Britain's leading shares, currently close to historic highs, is hinged on whether sterling continues its retreat, strategists and dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>With only a few companies set to report results next week, the focus is likely to remain fixed on the foreign exchange market, where sterling has stumbled this week.</p>
<p>The drop in the currency which started earlier in the week was accelerated by the newly-independent Bank of England which raised key lending rates to 7.0 percent from 6.75 percent, but hinted this would be the last for a while.</p>
<p>The pound, up some 25 percent against major currencies since the beginning of the year, sank, sparking a broad-based rally in British stocks.</p>
<p>Mid-caps, loaded with exporters, engineering concerns and other companies highly exposed to foreign exchange rates, began to show signs of life as sterling plummeted.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling will be a key feature next week. It will either get people excited or depress about stock rotation,&quot; said UBS stock strategist Mark Tinker.</p>
<p>The FTSE 250 had lagged some 18 percent behind the FTSE 100 since January as investors flocked to financial, oil and pharmaceutical shares, which are well represented in the leading index.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect to see more switching into 250 stocks, but remember that this is the silly (summer) season and the market is more vulnerable to erratic moves,&quot; one sales trader warned.</p>
<p>Richard Jeffrey, head of research at Charterhouse Tilney, was looking for sector rotation to continue into currency sensitive stocks from oil, drug and financial stocks, which have led blue chips into record-breaking ground.</p>
<p>&quot;The FTSE 100 is more responsive to the high liquidity. But we'd expect the 250 to outperform the FTSE 100 for the remainder of the year,&quot; Jeffrey said. &quot;I'd hesitate to say whether this is, in fact, the turning point.&quot;</p>
<p>Strategists and dealers said the market would be particularly sensitive to next week's July wholesale inflation data, after the central bank indicated that its latest move to tighten was consistent with its inflation target.</p>
<p>&quot;Markets are very jumpy and if anyone gets the whiff that what (the BoE) said isn't true, we could be in for some fireworks,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street wild card will continue to influence UK shares, albeit to a lesser degree, market watchers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't escape the shadow of Wall Street, but I think we're a bit farther away from it at the moment,&quot; Jeffrey said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106</p>
