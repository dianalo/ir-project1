<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is likely to visit the Siberian Kuzbass region, one of the main centres of a nationwide coal miners' strike, Interfax news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of the lower house of parliament, as saying after a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin that Chernomyrdin could fly to Kuzbass when he returns from a European security summit in Lisbon.</p>
<p>Trade union officials said about 400,000 Russian coal miners began a nationwide strike on Tuesday, complaining that they have not been paid for months. Union officials said it was one of the biggest strikes so far.</p>
<p>The miners called on Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to quit, blaming his government for the wage delays.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike is huge, probably the biggest, involving about 80 percent of all Russian miners -- we had only one similar strike in February,&quot; said Vitaly Budko, head of Coal Miners' Trade Union.</p>
<p>Some half a million coal miners went on an indefinite strike in February, but the stoppage lasted just two days. They suspended the strike after a cash promise from Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Budko said the miners wanted the cabinet to resign, but added that the demand was more a sign of despair rather than a political gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a political demand. The trade union wants the government to quit as it is unable to guarantee the civil rights of the people and unable to pay wages. Resignation of the government is not our aim, it is our cry of despair, to make them negotiate with us.&quot;</p>
<p>The officials said 154 out of Russia's 189 coal pits had stopped work. Some miners planned an indefinite stoppage, while others were halting deliveries to consumers for 24 or 48 hours.</p>
<p>Budko said the number of striking miners was unlikely to change in the next few days. He said the strike would go on until the government fulfils the economic demands.</p>
<p>&quot;We have set no time-limit. It will depend on the government's desire to talk to us and to solve our problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Union leaders say the government owes the miners at least 1.5 trillion roubles. &quot;We understand the state is unable to pay it at once. We want a schedule of payments, and we want it to be fulfilled,&quot; Budko said.</p>
<p>Consumers owe miners about eight trillion roubles.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said miners in the Kuzbass region in southern Siberia and in the Far East were among the most active strikers, while many pits in the Southern Urals continued work.</p>
<p>But coal mines of the Krasnoyarsk region declined to take part in the strike, and only one pit in the Orenburg region stopped work.</p>
<p>($1 = 5,520 roubles)</p>
