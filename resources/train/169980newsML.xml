<headline>French stocks at year-high after mixed U.S. poll.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-11-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>French shares notched up another high for the year on Wednesday after America's no-change election pleased Wall Street and the bond markets.</p>
<p>Relief that Bill Clinton had been re-elected president, but with the spending reins still held by Republicans in Congress, sparked a buying spree in Paris, with a massive 7.3 billion francs of turnover.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an exceptional volume,&quot; said one trader. &quot;This is not a rise in a vacuum.&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 26.05 points or 1.19 percent at 2,213.37, after hitting a session high of 2,218.57.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 futures contract was up 25 at 2,218 from Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;If interest rates continue to come down, there is no reason why the market should not continue to rise, but some people are cautious as the market is from now on at the level many forecast we would be at the end of the year,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>But others warned that after two days of strong gains, the market might start to consolidate, although heavy volumes in a rising market were often a sign the buying could continue.</p>
<p>Supermarket chain Carrefour rose 2.37 percent to 3,021 francs, helped by October sales figures which showed a 12.3 percent increase to 14.54 billion francs.</p>
<p>Tyremaker Michelin ended up 3.38 percent at 260 francs, with buying triggered by nine-month sales figures.</p>
<p>French holding group CGIP, which on Tuesday announced the purchhase of 20 percent of car parts maker Valeo, puts on 3.36 percent to 1,230 after selling 2.4 million shares in computer group Cap Gemini.</p>
<p>Pernod-Ricard was up 2.83 percent at 294.5 francs. Managing director Thierry Jacquillat said the French spirits market could fall by two to three percent in 1997 as a result of a rise in the spirits tax.</p>
<p>Luxury goods groups LVMH and Dior rose respectively 3.96 percent to 1,260 and 2.46 percent to 709. Goldman Sachs rated them as outperform.</p>
